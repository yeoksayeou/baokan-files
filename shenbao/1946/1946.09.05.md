### The Communist Party Still Insists on Preconditions; Five-Person Talks Await Commencement; Zhou Enlai Visited Special Envoy Marshall Yesterday for Extensive Discussions

[Our Nanjing Office, 4th Dispatch] The prelude to the informal five-person group meeting has already shown that it will encounter immense difficulties. The point of divergence stems from the Communist Party's repeated insistence on resolving two preconditions. The government believes that the purpose of convening this meeting, as suggested by Ambassador Stuart and Special Envoy Marshall, is solely to resolve the issue of reorganizing the National Government Committee and does not involve any other matters. This is because the reorganization of the National Government Committee is the crux of all other issues. Moreover, a ceasefire cannot be effectively achieved on the basis of the so-called unconditional ceasefire alone to achieve a permanent ceasefire. The foundation still lies in the reorganization and unification of the armed forces. If a satisfactory agreement can be reached on this point and implemented accordingly, then the fundamental conditions for a ceasefire will be met, and the war will stop by itself, even without being called to a halt. On the 4th, all parties were watching Zhou Enlai's actions, hoping that he could visit Stuart and Marshall promptly and that progress could be made so that this meeting could commence. However, Zhou only visited Special Envoy Marshall at 4:30 PM and left at 7:30 PM. According to a spokesperson for the Communist Party delegation, they can only provide eight characters at present, which means Mr. Zhou believes that "the situation is serious and the future is bleak." When reporters asked if he would visit Ambassador Stuart again for pre-meeting discussions, they were told that it had not yet been decided. However, they stated that if these two preconditions are not decided before the meeting, the meeting cannot be held. They also said that what they consider most important are the ceasefire and military matters, and they are not interested in the "eight, four, four, four" quota for members of the National Government Committee. The talks with Special Envoy Marshall on the 4th were mainly about the ceasefire issue. The Communist Party's attitude towards the small group meeting will be clarified in the coming days.

[Our Nanjing Office, 4th Dispatch] Ambassador Stuart and Special Envoy Marshall were still waiting to meet with Zhou Enlai with a positive attitude on the 4th. There were no activities from any parties in the morning. At 12:30 PM, Special Envoy Marshall visited President Song at Beijige, where they had a long conversation and had lunch together. Zhou Enlai only arrived at the guesthouse to meet at 4:30 PM. Ambassador Stuart first met with Minister Yu Dawei around 4:00 PM, reportedly a casual conversation covering a wide range of topics, including British and American customs and sentiments. Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng arrived at 5:00 PM and left at 6:15 PM. According to Wu and Zhang, their only current goal is to await the day when the small group meeting can be convened. Regarding the Communist Party's so-called preconditions, since they were not raised beforehand, they have no opinion to express. They only hope for a satisfactory outcome. Wu and Zhang were very calm in their attitude.

Wu and Zhang Visited Ambassador Stuart Again Yesterday, Making Extremely Constructive Representations

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th Dispatch] Government representatives Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng of the non-official five-person group meeting, visited Ambassador Stuart again at his residence at 5:00 PM on the 4th, for a long talk that lasted an hour and a half. Minister Yu Dawei happened to visit the Ambassador before Wu and Zhang arrived, so he also participated in the conversation, as did Fu Jingbo. After Wu and others left, the Ambassador met with the Central News Agency reporter alone. The Ambassador said: "We are all waiting for Mr. Zhou Enlai. Until Mr. Zhou informs us that he is ready to participate, there is nothing to do." Stuart continued: "Government representatives are prepared to participate in the talks." When asked about his impressions after meeting with government representatives twice, he said: "They show a very constructive and helpful attitude." He then said: "Minister Zhang and I are new to our positions, but Secretary-General Wu is an old friend. I met Mr. Wu when he was the mayor of Shanghai, and I visited him every time I went to Shanghai. Later, we met several times in Hong Kong and Chongqing." The Ambassador continued: "Yesterday, I met with Marshal Marshall and talked with the American senators who visited Beijing. Their visit to China is unrelated to the liquidation of American military property." The conversation lasted for twenty minutes. The Ambassador was very happy and showed that he still had hope for the talks. The Ambassador finally shook hands with the reporter and said: "I am invited to dinner by the British Ambassador tonight. He told me not to wear a tie, just a jacket, to attend this most informal dinner, which is what I am most happy to attend." The Ambassador went to the British Ambassador's dinner at eight o'clock. General Wyatt was also present. Furthermore, Zhou Enlai has not yet met with Ambassador Stuart this evening.

### Accepting Director Xue Yue's Advice, Hao Pengju Led His Troops to Revolt; Du Shu, Who Was Captured While Defending Dongming, Escaped and Returned

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 3rd Dispatch] Hao Pengju, the former commander of the Sixth Route Army, was incited by the Communist Party and moved north with his troops. After claiming to be the "Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic Allied Army," he eventually felt uneasy due to incompatible temperaments and suspicion and discrimination from the Communist Army. The reporter recently entered the city with the head of Suqian County. According to the surrendered officers and soldiers of the 3478th and other divisions of the New Fourth Army, Hao Pengju has accepted Director Xue Yue's advice, implemented a revolt with his troops, assumed a new position, and declared his support for the Central Government, obedience to Chairman Chiang, and commitment to peaceful unification, military reorganization, and national construction. He has been fighting against the Communist Army in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway.

He arrived at An Yang Dongtianshi Village on the first day and has telegraphed the Pacification Office to report and await orders.

### The Communist Army in Chifeng is Preparing to Retreat; Most of Rehe Province is Recovered; The National Army Advancing in Eastern Hebei Enters Laoting

[Our Beiping Office, 4th Dispatch] The claim that Chifeng has been recovered by the National Army has not yet been confirmed today, but the Communist Army guarding Chifeng is destroying the airfield and moving supplies on a large scale, which is the same as the signs of withdrawing from Chengde. The area is located in the center of Rehe, and occupying it can control northern Rehe and is the trading center for livestock fur of the Mongolians in northern Rehe and the trading center in the cold winter. At present, the counties recovered by the National Army in Rehe Province include Fuxin, Chaoyang, Lingyuan, Jianping, Pingquan, Lingnan, Ningcheng, Chifeng (although not confirmed, the government has sent a county magistrate there), Chengde, Luanping, and other ten counties, accounting for half of the province's twenty-one counties, but its main parts have all fallen into the hands of the government. Once the Pingcheng Road is opened, the military and political significance of Rehe should not be underestimated. Another report states that the National Army in Longhua has reached 20 kilometers northwest of Longhua, and another unit is advancing towards Fengning. Zheng Dongguo hinted to reporters that the Communist Army in Rehe offered little resistance because they concentrated their forces on capturing Datong, so recovering Weichang Chifeng should not be difficult. Although the distance from Gubeikou to Chengde is close, the mountains are heavy, and a part of the Communist Army is still concentrated in the mountains, so it may take some time for the National Army to advance.

[Our Beiping Office, 4th Dispatch] According to sources, the mopping-up operation in eastern Hebei started yesterday west of the Beining Railway. The National Army advancing southeast from Luanxian recovered Fencheng yesterday, and then recovered Laoting. It is expected that the plain area in the west of the Beining Line can be stabilized in ten days. The stabilization of the entire area of eastern Hebei will take about twenty days. Chen Jicheng, the deputy commander of the Eleventh War Zone, is now stationed in Tangshan. A certain military figure stationed in Tianjin will go to the front line tomorrow to inspect. Also, the claim that Gubeikou was recovered is not accurate, but the National Army going north has arrived at the first town north of Gubeikou yesterday. The war in that area is quite fierce. At the same time, the work of clearing the countryside is also being carried out in the Shijiazhuang area of central Hebei.

[Our Shenyang Office, 4th Dispatch] According to reports, Zheng Dongguo arrived at Shanhaiguan from Pingjin today and is currently in charge of the command of the National Army in that area.

[Our Tianjin Office, 4th Dispatch] General Zheng Dongguo flew from Shenyang to Beiping on the 2nd to meet with the military authorities in North China. At 12:30 noon on the 4th, he took a car through Tianjin and out of the pass.

[Our Shenyang Office, 4th Dispatch] When the reporter asked Commander Du Yuming about the war in Rehe, Du said that in order to no longer wait passively to be attacked, there was this advance. Our commander is Deputy Commander Zheng Dongguo. After two and a half days of effort, Chengde was officially recovered. Now, many new forces have arrived, and Chengde is becoming more peaceful. The National Army in Gubeikou will be able to join forces. The Jin-Cheng Road from Jinzhou to Chengde is now open to traffic to Pingquan. The road west of this point has been heavily damaged by the Communist Army and is now being repaired. According to Du's estimation, the Communist Army in Rehe still has 30,000 troops. The Communist Army in the far south had planned to cooperate with the war in Rehe and launch an offensive, but they were repelled.

[Central News Agency, 3rd Dispatch] Since Shi Jue, the commander of the 13th Army, will take office as the commander of the Chengde Garrison, the security in the city has gradually recovered. However, the Communist Army destroyed a lot before retreating. The power and electrical equipment of the city were bombed and destroyed, resulting in dim lights and a dark world. The Jingu Road has made rapid progress since the repair. Lingyuan to Pingquan is about to be opened for military use. The repair between the west and Chengde is difficult because the rails and sleepers are extremely damaged.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 4th Dispatch] The Military Mediation Department reported today that the whereabouts of the executive group stationed in Chengde are unknown. The last telegram received from the group was on August 27th. According to government sources, the National Army in Rehe is advancing rapidly, and the Communist Army is retreating to Olun, 250 miles northwest of Chengde, but this information has not yet been confirmed.

### Tang Enbo's Speech Denies He Will Head Jiangsu

[Our Nanjing Office, 4th Dispatch] Tang Enbo, the commander of the capital garrison, hosted reporters on the 4th. I recognize that he will serve as the chairman of Jiangsu Province. He also said: Some bandits in Taihu Lake have been dispatched to suppress them, and the Jinghu line is very peaceful. There is no problem with the security of the capital.

[Our Beiping Office, 4th Dispatch] The 25-member group investigating the Anping incident held a meeting on the morning of the 4th.

It will continue tomorrow morning.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 3rd Dispatch] The process of the 25-member group of the Military Mediation Department visiting the senior commanders of the three parties has been successfully completed.

### Zhangjiakou is Full of War Intent; Nie Rongzhen Admits That the National Army Entered Chengde; Regarding Datong, He Said That It is Still Under Siege

[Our Beiping Office, 3rd Dispatch] Amid the smoke of war on the Great Wall line, Nie Rongzhen (commander of the Jinchaji Border Region), who commands the Communist Army on this line, met with four Chinese and foreign reporters accompanying the 25-member group in Zhangjiakou today. He said: For military necessity, the Communist Army withdrew from Chengde on the 26th after fighting. The war is currently expanding to eastern Hebei and western Liaoning. Talking about Datong at the other end of the Great Wall, he denied that the Communist Army had ever entered Datong, saying that it was still under siege. Associated Press reporter Parker asked if the Communist Army must capture Datong. Nie replied: Everything is easy to say if there is peace. Then he attacked Yan Xishan for using Japanese prisoners of war and Hu Zongnan's troops for entering southern Shanxi. When reporters asked when Datong could be captured, Nie replied that it was not under his command and that Chief of Staff He Long and Zhang Zongxun were currently in charge. In the question and answer session, he denied the news that Fu Zuoyi's troops had reached Sanchahe, saying that the Communist Army on the western section of the Ping Sui Line was ahead of Zhuozi Mountain to the east and that it was still very calm there. Foreign reporters asked if the National Army attacked Zhangjiakou, would the Communist Army follow Chengde and retreat automatically or resist resolutely. Nie replied that if the other party was determined to attack, they would be determined to resist. Associated Press reporter Matteson felt that the visit was too brief and expressed his willingness to come again in the short term. Nie said poetically, "This is autumn, I hope this is spring." The current Zhangjiakou is full of war atmosphere. Almost every street's bulletin board is calling for mobilization for self-defense. A government official told me that the streets are arresting recruits very fiercely every day. The working hours of the military factories have been extended to fourteen hours, and they do not rest on Sundays. The border region trade company is rushing to make three thousand boxes of biscuits to慰勞"frontline" fighters. The wives of the Chinese Communist Party cadres have all been evacuated to the countryside. Many strips of paper have been re-pasted on every high-rise building. Anti-aircraft trenches have been dug everywhere in the fields of the suburbs. Today, while the group was entering Zhangjiakou City from the airport, two planes were circling in the air for reconnaissance, and then flew north. The representatives of the three parties were so frightened that they jumped out of the car and ran into the autumn crops to take cover once.

### Government Personnel in Guling Will Leave the Mountain Successively

### Deng Yingchao in Shanghai Speaks to the Press

[Report from this Newspaper] Deng Yingchao, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, hosted the press in this city at her residence at No. 107 Masnan Road at 3:00 PM yesterday to attend the International Women's Congress in the United States. Three points were reported: (1) The International Women's Congress was initiated by the late President Roosevelt's wife, with the aim of bringing together women from all countries in the world to jointly study and discuss the cooperative ways that should be adopted to assist in the realization of the United Nations Charter. The conference is scheduled to be held in New York on October 13th. Deng has received an invitation from Mrs. Kartell, the chairman of the steering committee of the conference, and will go abroad after the passport procedures are completed. In order to fully provide the opinions of the Chinese women to the conference, six questions were raised based on the conference's preliminary agenda, and she is prepared to publicly solicit opinions from female compatriots from various countries. (2) The International Democratic Women's Federation was established in Paris last November with the aim of eliminating fascism. At that time, representatives from more than 40 countries including Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France attended, and a total of ten people from China planned to participate. However, due to transportation restrictions, they were unable to make the trip, and the Chinese embassy in France was entrusted to submit the agenda on their behalf. As a result, the conference elected official directors of the conference, and China occupied eight seats, and notified the CCP area that it could occupy three seats (two official and one alternate). After the general election of women in the CCP area, Deng Yingchao, Cai Chang, and Ding Ling (alternate) were elected. The conference has now decided to convene the Executive Committee in Moscow on October 15th. The conference will last for three days, and the main issues are to resolve the aftermath and food issues. Deng decided to give up because of the conflict between the two conferences. (3) I hope that Chinese women will put forward their opinions as much as possible and submit them to the conference for discussion.

### The Communist Army in the Suburbs of Nantong Recruits Laborers, Forcibly Conscripting 150,000 Strong Men, Expanding the Militia Organization and Transferring Them to the Front Line

[Report from this Zhenjiang, 4th Dispatch] According to official sources, the Communist Army's rebellion in northern Jiangsu is unfulfilled and intends to conscript 150,000 strong men in the suburbs of Nantong. Conscription began on September 1st in Liuqiao, Qiantang, Lusi, and other places. In the name of holding a "turning over meeting," all the strong men who arrived were detained and escorted to another location to replenish the number of soldiers. It is said that nearly 40,000 strong men have been forcibly conscripted in Jinsha, Shigang, Xiting, Qiantang, Lusi, Liuqiao, and other areas in recent days, and they have all been imprisoned by the Communist Army in Shigang Town. Conscription is still continuing in various townships. In addition, the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu has recently expanded the militia organization, with the county as the regiment, the district as the battalion, and the township as the team. The township team leader is responsible for patrolling and checking, and is transferred to the front line when necessary. Each township is organized with a 1,000-member anti-special operations commando team to control all words and deeds of the people.

### Commander-in-Chief Chen Executed Reporters Yesterday, Summarizing Military Reforms, and the National Army's Reorganized Troops Have Exceeded 60 Percent

[Our Nanjing Office, 4th Dispatch] At 3:30 PM on the 4th, Commander-in-Chief Chen Cheng hosted Chinese and foreign reporters at Lishi Society, with more than a hundred people present. First, Chen made a brief report, which was divided into the following three points: (1) The reorganization of the Ministry of National Defense is gradually being completed. It is expected that all departments will be on the right track by the end of this month. (2) Regarding the military reorganization plan decided by the three-person group, the government is continuing to implement it. More than 60% have now been reorganized, and the rest will continue to be reorganized despite all difficulties. (3) The issue of surplus officers is being handled in the following three ways. First, those who are old and voluntarily retire have been allowed to retire. Second, those who still volunteer to be career officers are currently being trained to prepare them for incorporation into the army. Third, those who volunteer to change careers are currently undergoing career change education. After the report, reporters asked questions, and Commander-in-Chief Chen answered them one by one. The details are as follows:

Reorganization situation question: How many officers and soldiers have been reorganized? Answer: The original 59 armies have been reorganized into 59 divisions. It is hoped that the remaining 31 armies will be reorganized into 31 divisions, for a total of 90 divisions. Question: How will the surplus officers and soldiers be handled? Answer: Those who are surplus will retire.

Shanxi-Rehe war question: What is the situation in Datong? Director Li of the Ministry of National Defense answered on behalf of him: Mr. Zhou Enlai once guaranteed not to attack Datong, but since June 21, he has started attacking the outposts of the Datong regiment, and a total of nine counties have fallen, and he directly attacked Datong on August 3. As of today, Datong is still in the hands of the government army. Question: Is the National Army preparing to attack Zhangjiakou? Answer: Datong, Zhangjiakou, and Chengde have historically been regarded as a battlefield due to their topographical relations. If the Communist Army does not stop attacking Datong, the situation may expand to Zhangjiakou. Question: Is Yan'an also on the same battlefield as Datong in history? Answer: Yes. Question: What is the situation of the government army attacking Chifeng? Answer: There is no report of the occupation of Chifeng. I would like to make a brief report on the occupation of Chengde: The government's 13th Army has a unit stationed in Ningcheng north of Pingquan. When the Communist Army besieged Ningcheng, the army sent troops to relieve the siege. Then the front-line generals received a report from the representatives of the people of Chengde that Chengde was an empty city, and all Xiao Ke and He Long's troops had gone to attack Datong. The local people could not bear the harassment of the Communist Army and welcomed the National Army to enter. Therefore, they entered Chengde without bloodshed. In order to ensure Chengde, we had to occupy Longhua to its north and Luanping to its southeast.

Situation in Northern Jiangsu Question: What is the situation in Northern Jiangsu? Director Li of the Ministry of National Defense answered on behalf of him: At the beginning of July, Mr. Zhou Enlai suddenly protested to the government against the National Army's attack on Northern Jiangsu. The Communist Army forged the battle order of General Tang Enbo, using it as an excuse to launch a large-scale attack. The units participating in the attack included Su Yu and Tan Zhenlin's troops, with a total of about 16 regiments. They also falsely claimed that General Wang Tiehan was captured, and were eventually counterattacked by the government army and fled north. After the National Army recovered Rugao, Hai'an, and Libao, it did not pursue further in order to comply with the ceasefire agreement. However, the Communist Army reinforced and counterattacked again, successively capturing Dingyan and Linzi, and then besieging Hai'an. At present, the government has taken defensive measures to avoid further expansion of the situation. If the Communist Army continues to attack, exceeding the government army's limit of tolerance, the situation will inevitably expand.

National Army Equipment Question: How many American-equipped divisions does China have? Answer: Before the counter-offensive in the War of Resistance Against Japan, 39 divisions were planned, but after the victory, the American Lend-Lease Act was stopped, and the American equipment was also stopped being transported to China. Therefore, at present, only the six divisions originally in India are fully equipped, and the equipment level of the remaining 33 divisions is less than 70%.

### Zhou Enlai Tells Foreign Reporters That the General Situation and Future are Extremely Pessimistic; It is Said That the CCP Has No Minimal Contact with the Soviet Union

[Associated Press, this city, 3rd Dispatch] Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, returned to Beijing from Shanghai on the afternoon of the third. Before leaving, he met with reporters from the Associated Press and issued a statement, saying that the overall situation in China has the danger of causing a complete split and expanding into a full-scale civil war, and that it is natural for the Communist Army to choose a favorable location to implement a counter-offensive. One of the main reasons for the civil war is that it has been supported by the US government. If the US stops this assistance and withdraws its troops from China, peace "can be achieved immediately." Zhou also answered reporters' questions, saying that the Soviet government has never assisted the Communist Party, the Chinese Communist Party is a political party, and has no direct relationship with the Soviet Union. Zhou said that he did not believe that the Chinese civil war could automatically cause a third world war. Zhou also said that although the joint statement of Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart has admitted that its mission has failed, the United States is still negotiating to sell its surplus materials to China. These surplus materials are valued at US$855 million, which is the largest amount in Chinese history. Such open assistance to one side of the war in China will invalidate the peace efforts of Ambassador Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, and the civil war will be completely uncontrollable.

He also said that the Communist Army's war does not intend to incite a revolution to overthrow the government.

### Yu Bin Arrives in Shanghai and Talks About Impressions of His Trip North: The Northeast's Industry Awaits Revival, With a Solid Foundation, It Won't Be Difficult to Restore Its Former Glory

[This City News] Northeast Relief Association representatives Yu Bin and Wang Xiaolai flew from the capital to Beiping on August 6th, then went to Shenyang, Jinzhou, Sipingjie, Changchun and other places in the Northeast to comfort the refugees. They completed their mission and returned to Beiping on August 23rd. Archbishop Yu Bin transferred from Beiping to Jinan on the 30th, staying for three days. He met with General Wang Yaowu, Commander of the Second Pacification Zone. He flew back to Shanghai from Jinan on the evening of the 3rd. A reporter visited Mr. Yu at the Catholic Welfare Association yesterday. Here is a record of his conversation:

Situation in Shandong: Jinan has been surrounded by the Communist army several times. Outsiders believe that the military and civilians in the city are extremely anxious. However, what I saw when I arrived in Jinan was not the case. The military and civilians in the city are full of vitality. The city defense is solid, and the public security is very good. The situation in the entire Shandong province is also good.

Progress Outside the Pass: Generally speaking, the people outside the pass are very calm. Since Chairman Chiang personally visited the Northeast, there has been much progress. In terms of industry, although the heavy industry base suffered significant losses after being removed by the Soviet Union and destroyed by the Communist Party, because of its grand scale in the past, the remaining equipment is still better than that of the provinces inside the pass, and the foundation is very good. If a large amount of capital can be invested to supplement some of the equipment, it will be very easy to restore the original scale. Recently, most of the Japanese technical personnel have been repatriated. The compatriots outside the pass hope that Shanghai industrialists will be willing to go outside the pass to work together for industrial restoration. They explained in detail to Mr. Wang Xiaolai that there are more than 4,500 factories in the Shenyang area of ​​the Northeast alone, which are now under the unified management of the Northeast Production Administration. Mr. Wu Tiecheng once said, "If you don't go to the Northeast, you don't know how big the Northeast is." I can say: "If you don't go to the Northeast, you don't know how great the industrial potential of China is." The agricultural production in the Northeast this year is very abundant. Fertile fields reached 120%, and barren fields also reached about 60%. Except for some areas in Liaobei Province, where spring plowing failed due to Communist disturbances, all other areas have generally had a bumper harvest. The soybeans and sorghum on the Songhua River are boundless, truly worthy of the name of the national granary.

Takeover Work: As for the takeover work, generally speaking, I have not heard of any cases of corruption. However, after most of the factories were taken over, they often failed to start operations quickly. Among the takeover projects, the most noteworthy is the "Xiaofeng Man Power Plant" in Yongji. During the puppet Manchukuo period, the plant could generate 560,000 kilowatts, and the maximum capacity could be 1 million kilowatts. The plant's power could supply the civil and industrial needs of "Northern Manchuria" and "Southern Manchuria." After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the internal equipment was first removed by the Soviet Union, and then destroyed by the Communist Party. The remaining machines can only generate 130,000 kilowatts of electricity. Its power transmission area is still under the control of the Communist Party. Currently, only 30,000 kilowatts of electricity can be generated, and the remaining 100,000 kilowatts are stopped and not used, which is a pity.

Northeast Lacks Cotton: Speaking of the hardships of the people's livelihood, the Archbishop personally understands the lives of the people in the Northeast. There is no problem with food and housing, but the lack of cotton makes winter clothing a problem. In the blink of an eye, October is approaching, and the snowy season in the Northeast is approaching. Tens of millions of compatriots and 300,000 soldiers are in great need of cotton-padded clothing. If the Northeast Relief Branch cannot plan relief as soon as possible, it is feared that tens of thousands of people will freeze to death.

Vigorous Popular Sentiment: Finally, Mr. Yu said: The decision to go to the Northeast made me deeply feel that the Northeast people lack a sense of security and stability. This trip to the Northeast shows that the vigorous popular sentiment is full of new atmosphere. I hope that the people of the country and friendly countries can also have a new understanding of the Northeast. Changchun has now become one of the few modernized cities in the country. The magnificence of the buildings makes people forget its original appearance. It is heard that the enemy and puppet regime once planned to build a "Japanese Palace" in the city, with the intention of moving the capital from Tokyo to Changchun. The Continental Science Academy left by the enemy is extremely grand in scale. In addition, the self-defense forces in various parts of the Northeast have been universally established, step by step, and the defense is extremely solid.

### Two Honored Guests at the Chairman's Headquarters: One Representative Each from the Shaanxi and Shandong Youth League's Farmers and Workers: Attending Last Night's Dinner Without Losing Their True Colors

[Kuling Central News Agency, 4th] Tong Huaizheng, a young farmer from Shaanxi, and Shen Shirong, a young worker from Shandong, attended the dinner at the Chairman's Headquarters at 7:30 p.m. on the afternoon of the 4th, and were honored guests received by the Chairman. They respectively represent the vast number of young farmers and workers in Shaanxi and Shandong, came to Kuling to participate in the Second National Congress of the Youth League, and were elected as members of the Presidium. They are still dressed as farmers and workers, without losing their true colors, mixed among some Western-dressed and extravagantly dressed representatives, showing the universality and mass nature of the composition of the Youth League. They and the 26 members of the Presidium of the National Congress accepted the Chairman's special invitation to dine at the Chairman's Headquarters. During the dinner, they were deeply favored by the Chairman, and were asked for their opinions on improving the League's affairs.

### Minister of Food Xu Kan Reports: Bumper Harvests Everywhere This Year: The Establishment of "Ever-Normal Granaries" Is Difficult to Achieve for Now

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] This reporter recently interviewed Minister Xu Kan, who had just arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai, about food supply and the widely spread "Ever-Normal Granaries." Mr. first told me: "This year, God blesses us, and we celebrate the bumper harvest." The annual harvests in all parts of the country are good. It is true that the weather has been hot recently, which is of great benefit to the autumn rice. In addition, Siamese rice, Vietnamese rice and Argentine wheat flour are arriving continuously, so there is no problem with the supply of military and civilian food. In Shanghai alone, food prices are stable, and Wushan rice has fallen to around 30,000 yuan. The people of Shanghai prefer white japonica rice, and they still find tribute rice too rough, which is a major problem. As for the rumor that "Ever-Normal Granaries" will be established to avoid low grain prices hurting farmers, it is difficult to realize at present because it is not easy to build warehouses. There are two main tasks today: (1) To stabilize prices and lower the prices of goods other than food, so as to avoid the price difference between grain prices and the prices of daily necessities and fuel being too large; (2) To evenly transport grain so that the price of grain in grain-deficient areas is reduced, which can maintain the stability of grain prices in grain-producing areas. In fact, the fact that there is no shortage of food supply in the country relies on the smooth transportation. The Ministry of Food has made every effort to solve this problem.

### Minister of Finance Yu Clearly States: Government Bonds Will Be Repaid at Face Value: Rumors of Double Repayment Are All False

He said that the government's bond repayment at face value has been announced by the Ministry of Finance and clearly stated by President Song, and will never be changed. The various rumors outside are unfounded and are being used by speculators. They should not be easily believed or blindly followed.

First, Judge He described in detail the twelve points of crimes committed by the traitor Wang during his tenure as chairman of the Puppet North China Political Affairs Committee. The traitor Wang remained silent, and only his lawyers, Li Yishen and Wang Zanxi, defended him for an hour. The judge then said to the traitor Wang that if he did not speak at this time, there would be no more opportunity to speak in the future. The traitor Wang then replied: "I did not hear clearly the twelve points of crimes mentioned by the judge, and I have nothing to say. I deserve to be shot." The judge then announced that the verdict would be announced at 10:00 a.m. on September 7. The court adjourned at 1:30 p.m. and the traitor Wang was carried back to his cell. Also, the great traitors Guan Yixian, Lin Wenlong, Zhao Xinbo, Wu Zanzhou, Zhu Shushen and others will also be publicly tried in the near future, and evidence is being actively collected.

[Nanjing Central News Agency, 4th] The Capital High Court announced verdicts in two cases of Chinese traitors on the 4th: (1) Chen Yunwen was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment.

(2) Luo Huatang, a puppet agent, was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment.

It is heard that this suggestion was discussed and accepted at the UNRRA conference held in Geneva this time. The UNRRA office in China may not be closed until the end of 1947.

### Minister Chen Receives Reporters, Continued from Page 1

Communist Demands: Question: How does the Minister view the two additional demands made by the Communist Party at the Five-Person Conference? Answer: Please recall the actions of the Communist army after the announcement of the ceasefire agreement on January 13. You can see who is destroying the agreement. All battles, such as those on the Longhai Road and Li Xiannian's attacks, were caused by the Communist army's prior attacks. If the Communist army stops its attacks, the National Army will never attack. The best guarantee for the Communist army's so-called ceasefire is to implement the troop reorganization plan signed by the Three-Person Group. The troop reorganization plan of Mr. Ma, Mr. Zhang, and Mr. Zhou is interrelated in three aspects, namely the ceasefire agreement, the restoration of transportation, and the troop reorganization plan, which must be implemented simultaneously. Question: Recently, Yan'an claimed that the Xi'an military authorities ordered the withdrawal of the Eighteenth Group Army Office. What does this mean? Answer: This move by the government is nationwide. All military offices have been ordered to withdraw, not specifically targeting the Eighteenth Group Army. Question: If Ambassador Stuart's Five-Person Conference achieves something, does Your Excellency think that a full ceasefire can be achieved? Answer: I sincerely hope that the Five-Person Conference will achieve something. In this way, transportation, ceasefire, and all other issues can be resolved in conjunction. Question: After the Communist Party announced the mobilization order, what has been the reaction in the Communist-occupied areas? Answer: As far as I know, the people of Yutai have launched a resistance movement against the Communist army. The Communist army lurking in Suqian, Suining and other places has been bound and sent to the National Army by the local people. The people's aversion to the Communist army is evident.

So-called Conditions: Question: The Communist Party demands the cancellation of the five demands. Can the government agree? Answer: The so-called five demands are not any conditions. The troop reorganization plan stipulated that the Communist army would station one division in the Northeast and the government army would station fourteen divisions. On June 7, the Communist Party demanded to increase to five divisions in the Northeast. After Marshal Ma's compromise, it was increased to three divisions. This proves that it is not a condition, but a change in the entire plan. If the Communist army increases in the Northeast, it should decrease elsewhere. The Communist army must demand how many provinces and counties to occupy in the Northeast. The government believes that if the Northeast occupies too much, other parties should occupy less. Northern Jiangsu poses too great a threat to Nanjing and Shanghai, so please let it go. As a result, the Communist Party's proposals can be accepted by the government, but the government's proposals are rejected by the Communist Party. Therefore, if it can be implemented in accordance with the troop reorganization plan of February 25, there are no conditions at all.

Editorial

### The Rebirth of India

Jawaharlal Nehru, President of the Interim Government of India, was sworn into office in New Delhi on the second of this month. The establishment of this government symbolizes the rebirth of India. According to news reports, although this interim government is led by the leader of the Congress Party, its members include representatives of the Sikh community, leaders of the Parsi community, and representatives of the Muslim and Christian communities, which can be said to be fully representative. When he was sworn into office, Nehru called on the Indian people not to conflict with each other, but to cooperate together, with an open attitude, which is truly worthy of our admiration.

China and India are adjacent to each other. In the past, when transportation was difficult, there was still contact between China and India. Fa Xian, Xuanzang and others did not consider the dangers of the mountains and the vastness of the ocean, and went to India. This resolute spirit made the relationship between the Chinese and Indian people closer. Today, although the spread of Buddhism in India has almost disappeared, Buddhist thought is deeply imprinted in the minds of the Chinese people. Vegetarianism, non-killing, and the concept of reincarnation and nirvana all originated in India, and these concepts still play a role among even the uneducated Chinese villagers. In terms of cultural relations, the relationship between China and India can be said to be very deep. During the Second World War, India was also the main route of our international transportation, and the relationship between China and India became more frequent. Therefore, the Chinese people are full of joy and hope for the rebirth of India. May the Chinese and Indian people be able to work together more closely in the future, and work together to build a new world after the war and maintain lasting peace after the war.

What we regret is that the establishment of the interim government of India this time did not receive the cooperation of the Muslim League led by Jinnah, so that the day the interim government was established was the time when Muslim riots began. Muslims in various places either hung black flags or wore black veils to parade in the streets to show their opposition, and there were bloodshed incidents. How the situation will develop is still difficult to predict at this time. The non-cooperation of the Muslim League has not weakened the power of the interim government, because the interim government already includes representatives of the Muslim side for the time being, but the existence of such a non-cooperative political group is naturally easy to cause domestic unrest. Moreover, according to a United Press report from Bombay on the 3rd, Jinnah told people, even hinting that the Soviet Union's attention to Indian affairs may exceed that of a bystander. It can be seen that the Indian situation is actually related to the evolution of the entire Middle East situation. Therefore, we sincerely hope that both the followers of Hinduism and the Muslim League can be tolerant and seek ways and foundations for cooperation with each other, so that the rebirth of India this time will not be frustrated. As the interim government of India is established, we hereby express our congratulations and wish President Nehru good health.

### From Rationing to Allocation

The biggest drawbacks of rationing are two: (1) black markets arise for goods; (2) goods flow into the black market.

There are many reasons for this, such as too loose control, inaccurate calculations, and the inability to grasp all materials, etc.; but the most important reason is that the difference between the rationed price and the market price is too large, and the amount of goods allocated is too small to meet actual needs. Because supply cannot meet demand, black markets arise; because black markets are profitable, allocated goods inevitably flow into the black market. Therefore, to eliminate the black market, in addition to reasonably adjusting the rationed price, it is of course necessary to increase the quota at the same time. If the quota is too small, the black market cannot be eliminated unless the rationed price is raised to the level of the black market. At present, the rationed prices of many rationed goods often fluctuate, which is actually no different from following the black market. The reason for this lies here.

The price of sugar was adjusted the day before yesterday. Now, black market sugar has been selling for more than 200,000 yuan, while the rationed price is always pegged to the original price of 70,000 yuan, which is tantamount to creating opportunities for speculators. Just look at the newly established sugar stores that have sprung up recently, which can prove how generous the profits are!

Therefore, we do not think that this adjustment is surprising. What is considered surprising is the point of rationing as much as possible. If, as the authorities claim, they will ration as much as possible in the future, then the black market can at least be expected to ease somewhat, and the rationed price announced will also be expected to be relatively lasting.

However, the purpose of rationing is to save materials. In other words, because materials are not sufficient, rationing is necessary. If production is abundant and there is no shortage, then it should be possible to buy and sell freely. In the rationing measures announced this time, there is also the point that "sugar purchase certificates" will be issued to citizens of this city, which is a very noteworthy thing. How these sugar purchase certificates will be issued and how they will be rationed has not yet been announced, so we need not speculate. However, one point can be pointed out in advance, that is, we are about to move from rationing to allocation. We know that to truly save materials and seek a reasonable distribution, allocation is indeed indispensable. Allocation is meticulous, comprehensive, and very scientific, which is very different from the rough and general rationing method. However, allocation is also much more difficult to implement than rationing. Since the authorities have this determination, we hope that they will prepare carefully and distribute accurately. It is best to set up another agency specifically to handle this matter. Because what should be allocated is actually not just sugar; what can be allocated is not just sugar. Recently, private parties have often heard this suggestion, and the central government also seems to have this plan. It seems that it is possible to start with sugar and establish a scale.

[Our Dispatch] Paris, 4th - A broadcast reports that the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference opened at 4 PM today at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Since Molotov had not yet returned to Paris at that time, Vyshinsky represented the Soviet Union. Today's meeting was convened at Vyshinsky's request. The main issue discussed was whether to simultaneously convene a conference of eight nations in New York during the Paris Peace Conference. It seems the Soviet Union still insists on postponing the United Nations General Assembly, and this opinion has not changed.

[United Press, Paris, 4th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has returned here today after reporting to Stalin in Moscow for four days. He is apparently prepared to inform his American, British, and French colleagues of Stalin's views. Meanwhile, at today's peace conference, the issues of Trieste and Venezia Giulia remain deadlocked.

This note was presented on August 30th. The two previous notes presented by Yugoslavia have not received satisfactory responses.

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The United States today informed Yugoslavia that if the Tito government is willing to compensate for the loss of life and property from the downed American aircraft, the United States is willing to write off this dispute.

Two unarmed American aircraft slightly deviated from their course due to bad weather and appeared over Yugoslav airspace, forcing them to land. Undersecretary of State Clayton has presented a lengthy statement of 3,100 words to the Yugoslav Chargé d'Affaires, Mekitor, explaining the American side's views.

### United States Must Maintain Considerable Military Strength in Certain Countries, Patterson Speaks in San Francisco

[United Press, San Francisco, 3rd] U.S. Secretary of the Army Patterson, before returning to Washington today, received reporters here, stating that U.S. troops stationed in China were very "justified." As for which regions where U.S. troops are stationed abroad are more important to maintaining international peace, Patterson did not differentiate, only stating "all places are important." Patterson also said that the United States does not need to immediately rearm in the current world situation. If necessary, "I believe that we can restore the situation from a year ago within six months." Patterson then answered reporters' questions, saying, "I think it is very justifiable for U.S. troops to be stationed in China. However, Italy, Germany, and Korea each have their own problems, and the United States must maintain a considerable military strength in certain countries." A reporter asked if the new meteorological report set up by the U.S. Army Air Forces between San Francisco and the Aleutians for the Superfortress's planned flight from Honolulu to Cairo had any special significance. Patterson replied, "Yes. It is very significant. These long-range flight demonstrations and the increase in weapon power will become more and more frequent, and rockets are not entirely under the air force."

### Major Retail Sales in the United States, Nylon Stockings Sell for Only One U.S. Dollar After Work, Amazing Automobile Production

[United States Information Service, Washington, 3rd] Competition in the U.S. retail industry is becoming increasingly intense. Major department stores have launched discount campaigns to attract customers. The volume of retail goods continues to be 25% to 40% higher than last year, and in many categories, there is almost a shortage of supply. However, under the new policy, prices have been reduced. For example, men's white shirts have been reduced from US$3.95 per piece to US$2.66. Nylon stockings are selling for only US$1.20 per pair, and many other goods are being sold for only 15% higher than the wholesale price, and all are lower than the price limits set by the Price Administration. Competition in the automobile manufacturing industry is also quite intense. A total of 250,000 new automobiles were produced in August, and it is hoped that a total of 2.475 million will be produced in 1946. The estimated demand is between 13 million and 17 million units. The Yokosuka residence was sold. Prince Nashimoto also sold his Takajo residence for 400,000 yuan. Prince Takamatsu, the third younger brother of Hirohito, also sold his Takanawa residence and moved into a smaller house. Currently, the Japanese imperial family is concerned about the property tax issue. It is said that Prince Takamatsu has the most property among the imperial family, at 15 million yuan, followed by Prince Nashimoto at about 3.5 million yuan. Prince Mikasa, the fourth younger brother of Hirohito, has the least, at about one million yuan. According to the property tax rate, 76% of the property value should be collected. For example, Prince Kaya's property is only 1.5 million yuan. After deducting property tax, he only has 360,000 yuan left, which is not easy to maintain his current lifestyle. Therefore, he can no longer hire a chauffeur and drives himself. Prince Fushimi takes a bath once every four days to save fuel, and his children can only take the tram or walk to school. The Princes Kitashirakawa and Takeda are cultivating their gardens and having their children grow vegetables.

### Japanese Imperial Family at the End of the Road, Selling Real Estate and Growing Vegetables

[Kaizo Company, Tokyo, 4th] Since MacArthur announced the abolition of their privileges in May, the Japanese imperial family has had their monthly living expenses of 10,000 yen, which were paid by the Imperial Household Ministry, stopped, and all other preferential treatments have also ceased. In addition, they must pay all taxes, including income tax, land tax, and property tax, just like ordinary citizens. To establish a new way of life, they can only cut spending, selling luxury items such as cars, valuable furniture, utensils, and works of art to pay for living expenses. Some want to sell large houses or villas. For example, Prince Takeda has already sold his

### Masterminded the Murders of Three Reporters and Two Judges, One of the Leading Figures of "76" in Western Shanghai, Xia Zhongming Retracts Confession During Retrial, Wen Lantong and Chen Jicheng to Be Interrogated Today

[Our Dispatch] The High Court is scheduled to hear the case of Wen Lantong, the former Chairman of the National Commercial Control Association, at 10:00 AM today. Whether or not he will appear in court remains a mystery. In the afternoon, the cases of Chen Jicheng, the former ambassador to Manchukuo, and Mao Tiemei, an intelligence officer of the former Nanjing Political Security Bureau, will be heard.

[Our Dispatch] The High Court yesterday heard several cases of suspected traitors. Xia Zhongming, 45 years old, from Shanghai, was the chief clerk of the city's police headquarters before the war. After the war began, he served as the supply director of the Shanghai National Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Force Headquarters. He was later captured by the enemy and defected in August 1939, serving as Li Shiqun's Japanese translator, the leader of the direct group of the former Special Operations Headquarters, the executive deputy director of the former Investigation and Statistics Department, and the director of the Shanghai Office, among other positions. He was also a leading figure of "76." He was arrested after the victory and prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office. He was interrogated by the High Court once before. At the retrial yesterday afternoon, the defendant was wearing a gray serge long gown, with a small-checked cotton short shirt and trousers underneath, and yellow leather shoes. His back was slightly hunched, and his face was thin. He denied all the confessions he made to the Military Intelligence Bureau, claiming that they were made under duress. He also denied all the terrorist incidents inquired about by the court, such as presiding over the assassinations of Zhu Xinggong of the Chinese-language Ta Mei Evening News, Zhang Sixu of the English-language Ta Mei Evening News, Jin Huating of the Shen Bao, Qian Hongye, the criminal division chief of the Special District Local Court, Yu Hua, the criminal division chief of the Special District High Court, and the kidnapping of employees of the Bank of China and the Farmers Bank, claiming that he did not know about them or was not in Shanghai at the time. He claimed that he had rescued more than 30 arrested Youth League members and many underground workers. The court then summoned Zhang Hongwei and Wang Ming, both of whom testified that the defendant had rescued them. Later, Xu Weizhen, the former president of the former Shanghai High Court, who had already been sentenced, was questioned in detail about the assassination of Qian Tingwei and the "76" takeover of the Special District Court. Xu denied any involvement in the matter. The court ordered that the case be reheard at a later date.

### Concealing Shao Shijun's Assets as a Traitor, Shen Shubao Continues Trial and Is Released on Bail

Shao Shijun, the former Director of the Su-Zhe-Wan Unified Tax Bureau of the former Reformed Government and the former Director of the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance of the former National Government, disappeared without a trace after the victory. The amount he had amassed over the years was unknown, hence the nickname "God of Wealth." On August 11 last year, after hearing the news of the enemy's surrender, his wife, Jiang Dongrong (also known as Dongrong), packed some valuables and jewelry into five leather boxes and a steel safe, and deposited them in the clinic of Dr. Shen Shubao at 195 Ma Huo Road. She later opened the safe, removed some valuables, and stored them in a type B safe deposit box number 703 at the Shanghai West District Branch of the Four Banks Trust Department and safe deposit box number 85 at the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, both rented under Shen Shubao's name. Later, after the authorities pursued Jiang Dongrong, she confessed the previous events, and Shen Shubao's wife also voluntarily reported the matter to the City Party Headquarters, and the traitorous assets were recovered. Shen Shubao was then prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office for the crime of concealing traitorous assets, along with Shao Shijun and others. However, because Shao himself is still at large and has not been apprehended, he is still wanted. Therefore, only Shen Shubao was interrogated at the hearing yesterday afternoon. Shen testified that he knew Jiang Dongrong because he had treated her for an illness. Last year, she rented a ward in his clinic, and later came with her sister, Jiang Donghua, claiming that her sister was getting married and needed to deposit some clothes and ornaments. On October 11, she suddenly came with several armed soldiers and took away some of the boxes. When he returned home at night, he learned that the property belonged to Shao Shijun. His wife then voluntarily reported the matter to the City Party Headquarters. The court ordered that the case be reheard at a later date, and the defendant remained on bail.

On the same day, the cases of Rao Shu, the former Chief Inspector of the Special High Section, and Shan Xinfa were heard. Witnesses were questioned and detained for further hearings.

Another three cases, Zhu Guilin, Chen Shusheng, and Lin Liangwei, were not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence.

### Xue Jianqiu Case Resolved, Transferred to District Court for Handling

[Our Dispatch] The main culprits in the Xue Jianqiu "kidnapping" case, Zhang Xifu and others, after being transferred from the Garrison Command Military Law Department, were found after several investigations not to have intended to kidnap and extort. They had merely encountered Xue Jianqiu midway, identified him as a traitor, and used intimidation to make him feel fearful in order to obtain money. They later went to bars, dance halls, and barbershops together. Xue Jianqiu could have refused to comply and reported the crime to the police at any time, and did not completely lose his free will. As for the detention in the guard room of a building in the central district, it was still nothing more than a method of intimidation to obtain money. Based on the precedent of the Supreme Court's Ruling No. 976 of 1929, the act of private detention for the purpose of intimidating someone into handing over property should be punished as a serious crime of intimidation. Since these culprits are not military personnel, they will be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office today for handling.

### The 行總's Large Number of Vessels Are Handed Over to Various Shipping Companies for Management. Liu Hongsheng Convened Various Companies to Discuss Methods

In order to solve operational difficulties and to expedite the transport of relief supplies, 行總 Executive Director Liu Hongsheng is preparing to hand over all of the 行總's vessels to various shipping companies for management, with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company also invited to participate. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, representatives from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) including Mr. Kirk, 行總 representatives including Director Chen Guangyuan, and shipping industry representatives including Li Yunliang, Cheng Yuzhai, and Wei Huanzhang were specially invited to a meeting. Hosted by Chairman Liu Hongsheng, the meeting discussed methods for handing over 行總's large number of vessels to various shipping companies for management. The meeting lasted for three hours and the results were very satisfactory.

### Private Companies Oppose Monopoly

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] One hundred and twenty-five private shipping companies are deeply dissatisfied because the 行總 and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have exclusively established a temporary contract, with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company monopolizing the transport of relief supplies and other companies unable to share in the benefits. It is rumored that they will take joint action. When reporters inquired about this with the 行總's person in charge, the following response was received: 行總 Director Jiang stated at a meeting of the Far East Committee that no shipping company should monopolize the distribution of relief goods. The current agreement with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, where 行總 vessels are handed over to the company to transport relief supplies, is entirely because the company has wider shipping routes and more complete facilities and equipment (such as wharves and warehouses). There is no matter of monopolization. According to the agreement, if there is extra cargo space when the vessels return after transporting 行總's supplies, commercial goods can be loaded. This provision is purely to avoid empty return trips and has no other meaning. The main reason for the 125 shipping companies' attack on the 行總 is that other companies also desperately need vessels and equipment due to war losses, but the 行總 has never allowed them to transport materials on their behalf. Now that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is enjoying the benefits alone, it is inevitably unfair.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Oil Tankers Will Go Abroad to Transport Oil

[Our Newspaper] All of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's new oceangoing vessels use oil as fuel, so it specifically purchased four 10,000-ton oil tankers, all of which have been received. Of the eighteen 2,000-ton oil tankers, twelve have been received. Yesterday the Yonglu was received, and today the Yongluan, a large oil tanker, will continue to be received. Preparations are being made to purchase and transport oil directly from oil-producing regions. Smaller oil tankers will specialize in supplying fuel to ships in various locations. It is reported that the company will place an order for oil with Iran. Once the purchase is finalized, the Yonghong oil tanker will be dispatched for loading. The ship is currently undergoing repairs and completing procedures for going abroad. If this initiative is realized, it can be described as a pioneering feat of Chinese ships sailing abroad.

### The Fish Market Allocates 200 Million Yuan to Provide Large Loans to Fishing Boats

A Shenjiamen Office Has Been Established

The Shanghai fish market, in view of the economic decline in fishing areas and the inability of fishermen to go out to sea to fish, has decided to directly provide loans for capital and purchase fresh fish in major fishing areas. An office has been established in Shenjiamen, and 200 million yuan has been initially allocated to handle this. It is estimated that at least one hundred large fishing boat pairs can obtain loans to repair fishing gear, settle families, and go to sea. The fish they catch will be purchased by the fish market at market prices and transported to Shanghai for sale.

### UNRRA's Egerton Inspects New Fishing Boats

These deep-sea fishing boats are supplied to China by UNRRA, with a total of over 200 vessels, which will arrive in Shanghai one after another. After boarding the ship for a trial run, Egerton also inspected the Zhoujiazui Island wharf and the island's fish market. According to Dr. Su, director of the Fisheries Rehabilitation Administration, the Yangshupu fish market, which is closer to the city center, will be expanded to accommodate the large amount of fresh fish caught by the new fishing boats.

### Sun Tianchang's Crimes Are Serious; High Court Detains Him After Interrogation

[Our Newspaper] The case of Korean Sun Tianchang providing military supplies to the enemy has been thoroughly investigated by the 消查團, which believes that there is indeed evidence of providing aid to the enemy, so it was transferred to the District Court Procuratorate for investigation.

It is reported that Sun's wife, Zhao Dongshan, has been actively lobbying recently and has hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and others to defend Sun.

### Ministry of Finance Rectifies Financial Discipline; Orders Dao Heng Bank to Suspend Operations

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Shanghai Dao Heng Bank was originally approved by the Central Bank as a Class A foreign exchange business.

The order has been issued and telegraphed to the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Bankers Association for supervision.

### Two War Criminals, Matsuda and Kawashima, to be Tried by US Court This Morning; Accused of Mistreating Prisoners of War in Changchun

Following the Hong Kong case, the US military court will try Japanese war criminals Colonel Matsuda and Captain Kawashima at 8:00 AM this morning at Tilanqiao Prison. They are accused of mistreating American soldiers in Changchun. The former was the director of the Japanese Changchun Prisoner of War Management Office, and the latter was a medical officer managing prisoners of war. Both committed extreme cruelty against the American prisoners of war in Changchun. US Army Lieutenant Colonel Hankins and Sergeant Gagnet were the most severely mistreated. They arrived in Shanghai from the US a few days ago to testify against the two war criminals. Hankins was arrested by the Japanese army during the Pearl Harbor incident in 1942 and transferred to the Changchun prisoner of war camp, where he was released when the Soviet army entered Changchun in 1945. Hankins served in the military for 18 years and suffered oppression and abuse by the Japanese in Changchun. He will now testify. Sergeant Gagnet became blind during his captivity due to mistreatment and is accompanied by his wife on this trip to Shanghai.

### Municipal Government Auctions Confiscated Goods; Investigation Team Notes Two Points: Whether the Auction Should Occur and Whether the Procedures Are Legal; All Accounting Books Will Be Sent to the Audit Bureau for Review

[Our Newspaper] Regarding the 4 billion yuan embezzlement case, Zhang Qingzhen from the investigation team personally visited Mayor Wu the day before yesterday to inquire about the proceedings. It is now learned that Mayor Wu made a special phone call to Committee Member Zhang at 10:00 AM yesterday to correct what he said the day before about the audit bureau participating in the auction of pseudo-Central Market goods during his term, saying that it was a temporary memory error. He also said that the auction method still followed the method during Mayor Qian's term, and the audit bureau did not actually participate. Furthermore, according to Committee Member Zhang's statement to reporters: The Municipal Government Confiscated Goods Management Office's entire inventory of confiscated goods, accounts, and auction records are planned to be submitted to the Shanghai Office of the Audit Department of the Control Yuan for review. However, yesterday, Committee Member Zhang visited Director Xie Haoling, but because the accounting books had not yet been retrieved, they were not brought back. Committee Member Zhang also stated that there are two key points in this case: (1) Responsibility Issue: The municipal government should not auction off these goods to fund welfare undertakings, because other cities do not have such a large amount of enemy-pseudo goods, so how will employee welfare be handled? Therefore, the use of such goods should be centrally planned and distributed by the state. The municipal government does not seem to have the right to handle them. (2) Procedural Issues: Whether the auction procedures are legal and whether the income and expenditure figures match still need to be reviewed by experts from the Audit Bureau before it can be known whether there are any abuses. According to the municipal government's report to the investigation team: As of May 27 of this year, the Xingye Trust Company handled the pseudo-Central Market goods on behalf of the municipal government, with a total value of 3.031981 billion yuan. The total expenditure for employee welfare and the city's education fund was 3.00813542 billion yuan. This matter was handled by General Manager Xu Baohua of Xingye Trust Company, together with Qian Jianqiu, a city government counselor, under the orders of Mayor Qian. Later, after the municipal government was reorganized in May, Xu Baohua, general manager of Xingye Trust Company, resigned, and Xie Haoling, director of the Confiscated Goods Management Office, was appointed by the municipal government, together with Qian Jianqiu, to continue handling the matter. All the procedures are recorded in files and inventories for verification.

### Hanyang Ship Carries Smuggled Sugar; 68 Packages Confiscated

[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Police Department confiscated a large number of smuggled white and brown sugar packages, totaling sixty-eight, weighing 7,869 kilograms, worth approximately 30 million yuan at the legal rate. Ten suspects were apprehended. The smuggled sugar was transported to Shanghai by the Hanyang vessel. Yesterday, based on a report, the police first confiscated 28 packages of brown sugar in Lane 44, Sichuan South Road, and arrested two rickshaw pullers, Wu Zongming and Wang Qiuhai. They then went to Taikoo Wharf and arrested the foreman and the wharf guards Li Alin, Hu Shenghe, and Liu Shuangquan for helping to unload the sugar. They then raided the Xin Zhan inn at 77 Jinling Road and found dozens of packages of brown sugar. According to the innkeeper Bai Zhenmei, the sugar was introduced and deposited by Cai Sicong of 32 Sichuan South Road. The investigating police officer then detained Cai for interrogation. According to the confession, the sugar belonged to Zheng Tongcheng, the comprador of the Hanyang vessel of Taikoo Company. Customs officials were contacted and nineteen packages of brown sugar were found on the Hanyang ship, and one package was found in the Taikoo warehouse. Later, the comprador Zheng Tongcheng, the tally clerk Zheng Xueshan, and the boatswain Wu Bingshun were summoned for questioning. According to Zheng Tongcheng, the smuggled sugar was the tally clerk's. Zheng only transported it on behalf of a Hong Kong friend, Yu Fa.

We are preparing to hold a comprehensive symposium. We are very grateful that Professor Pei Fei can attend. We hope that Professor Pei Fei can share his impressions after coming to China, because China has undergone many changes after eight years of war. I believe Professor Pei Fei will have good opinions."

Professor Pei Fei then delivered a speech, stating: "Since coming to China, I feel that the general observation of Chinese people is that the domestic political situation is a reflection of international problems. Whether this view is correct remains to be proven by facts. We don't want to say more. As for why Japan suffered such a disastrous defeat, it was based on its own stupidity and arrogance. When the Lugouqiao Incident broke out, I expressed in Japan that if Japan did not abandon its policy of aggression against China, it would inevitably encounter a tragic fate unprecedented in history." After Professor Pei's speech, the committee members discussed Far Eastern issues with him, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. The symposium adjourned around 7:00 PM.

### It Is Difficult to Reduce the Proportional Amount of Banquet Tax

The banquet industry in this city is quite unclear about the collection of banquet tax stipulated by the Municipal Finance Bureau. They listed several points and submitted them for instructions but did not receive a reply. Yesterday afternoon, they specially sent several representatives to the bureau to ask Director Gu for instructions. Deputy Director Hu Wenzhi received them and answered various questions. It is said that the banquet tax is collected on behalf of the government, and the above tax rate cannot be considered for reduction. The unified account form made by the bureau is a necessary measure for tax collection. The reason for making the bureau's form is only to standardize the format for easy inspection. All legitimate restaurants should support and promote it and not oppose it. All small restaurants whose meals sold do not exceed 1,200 yuan can use the meal ticket method to avoid banquet tax.

### "The Net of Heaven Has Wide Meshes" Is True; US Navy Ship Theft Case Cracked; One of Four Films Retrieved; Sold Repeatedly Before It Was Realized It Was Stolen Goods

[Our Newspaper] A certain US Navy ship anchored in the Huangpu River recently had four sound films for entertainment stolen from it.

Zhang Chen, a 31-year-old Ningbo woman who was a servant from a certain family at 41 Tonglu Road, was attractive, and Shen had jokingly said he wanted to marry her as a concubine, but due to their social status, it was never done. Who knew that this was heard by outsiders, and a group of gangsters, knowing that Shen Longxing had accumulated wealth, conspired to extort money. At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, a man dressed in a military uniform, holding a weapon, led two men in plainclothes to the coffin shop, intending to talk to the owner. Shen was away in the countryside, so his wife, Shen Jin, came out to meet them. The men made a great uproar, and when they disagreed, the man in military uniform beat her with a belt, causing injuries and bleeding, and forced her to meet them at the Dadong Tea House at 4:00 PM yesterday. After the meeting, they left. Afterwards, Shen Jin, injured, reported to the Penglai Branch.

### Statement by the Garrison Command Regarding the Return of the Ransom Money in the Rong Case

After the Garrison Command released the news that the 245,000 US dollars in recovered loot from the Rong case would be returned to Rong Desheng, some people argued that the money should be used for disaster relief instead of being returned. Lawyers in the city also expressed their opinions. Yesterday, the Military Law Office of the Garrison Command, which handled the case, issued a statement explaining the reasons for returning the money: (1) Except for cases where the defendant is a soldier, bandit cases should be tried by the judicial organs in accordance with the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations. However, due to the special circumstances in the Songhu area, the Army Headquarters submitted a report to the National Government, which approved it as a martial law area and authorized the General Headquarters to handle bandit cases in accordance with the Martial Law. The Rong Desheng kidnapping incident is a crime under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 9 of the Regulations for the Suppression of Bandits. Therefore, it will be tried by this headquarters. (2) The ransom money in the Rong case is the property obtained by the bandits and should be returned to the victim in accordance with Article 7, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations for the Suppression of Bandits. As for how to dispose of the ransom money after it is returned, it is Rong Desheng's right and not something that the judicial organs can decide on his behalf. (3) The current Regulations for the Suppression of Bandits are different from the expired Regulations for the Suppression of Kidnappers. There is no explicit penalty for Rong Xingsheng's family asking others to pay the ransom, so Rong Desheng cannot be given any crime. Whether the current Regulations for the Suppression of Bandits are suitable for the current public security needs of Shanghai is a legislative issue, and this headquarters is not in a position to comment.

The Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government previously notified the Sixth District Office (Lujiawan) that the affairs of the bao cadre were complex and the responsibility was heavy, and it was inappropriate for women to serve in terms of physiology and physical strength. It was instructed to select personnel from the District Office who were physically strong, energetic, and able to endure hardship to serve on the opposite of the existing female bao cadre. The district currently has three female bao cadre, namely Liu Dejun in the Sixth Bao, Hu Fumei in the Eighth Bao, and Tang Yinjing in the Thirty-fifth Bao. The District Office notified them yesterday to transfer to the office for service. Assistant staff Kuang Yazhen, Qian Runzhi, and Song Wangsen, who had achieved excellent results, were selected to work at Bao, and they have all gone to take over, in order to adjust Bao's affairs.

### Section 31 Distributes Relief Flour

The Section Office of the Thirty-First Section (Gaoqiao) of this city, upon receiving a letter from the Shanghai Relief Branch, convened all Bao chiefs at 2 PM on the afternoon of August 30th to discuss the distribution of relief goods. The Relief Branch dispatched Team Leaders Yang and Qian to the meeting to instruct on the procedures for distributing the first batch of flour and decided that the distribution date would be September 12th. Arrangements will be made according to the number of destitute households. It is planned to set up stations 1 and 2 in Gaoqiao, station 3 in Donggou, and station 4 in Zhangjiaqiao. The persons in charge of each station will be the local Bao chiefs. The discussion lasted until about 4 PM before adjourning.

### High Interest Rates · Decreased Sales to Merchants Cotton Yarn Black Market Continues to Plunge Qingdao Goods Are Even Lower Than the Spinning and Weaving Factory's Listed Price Double Horse Rationing Price Was Lowered Again Yesterday by 80,000

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the yarn and cloth market was extremely weak. The Spinning and Weaving Factory's listed prices remained unchanged: 42-count double-strand "Sunlight" at 1.9 million, 32-count double-strand "Xiantao" at 1.8 million (on cones), and 20-count pure cotton grass bale at 1.15 million. However, the market prices fell sharply. 42-count initially decreased to 2.18 million, then fell to 2.15 million. 32-count "Blue Phoenix" was still quoted at 1.8 million, but there were no buyers. The market price of "Xianzi" cone yarn was actually 30,000 lower than the Spinning and Weaving Factory's listed price. Qingdao's 32-count "Maid" goods were sold at 1.495 million, which was more than 100,000 lower than the Spinning and Weaving Factory's asking price. The rationing price of "Double Horse" yesterday dropped from 1.4 million to 1.32 million, but less than 1,000 pieces were rationed. The spot price on the market once fell to 1.47 million, which was 170,000 to 180,000 lower than last week. It then rebounded to 1.52 million due to absorption by Guangdong merchants. The prices of other 20-count brands fell by about 20,000 to 30,000. The prices of 42-count and 32-count fine yarns decreased slightly by about 10,000. People are still not optimistic because of the news that customs has limited re-exports. It is said that from today, anyone purchasing cotton yarn and cloth from this city for transport to Guangdong, Fujian, and other places must apply to the Customs Administration for approval before being allowed to export. If manufacturers in South China have legitimate needs, the Textile Industry Management Committee will formulate rationing measures. Therefore, the appetite of Guangdong merchants has decreased. Because the edge silver is tight, factories dare not take action. Dealers are reluctant to make deals due to tight cash flow and high interest rates, and they are willing to sell at a loss. This is why yarn prices have fallen sharply. According to yarn factory insiders, the flower cloth rationed by the Executive Yuan Relief Administration last time has been settled at the new exchange rate. The market price of flower cloth, which was previously over 90,000, has now risen to 160,000, and it is said that it may rise to 200,000 based on current costs, implying that there is a potential for further price increases. However, according to news from practical manufacturers, yarn factories are now concentrating on delivering goods, and goods are only delivered after payment. Moreover, there is no guarantee of delivery, and the pricing is unknown when applying to purchase yarn each time. It is believed that this is beneficial for yarn factories, but inconvenient for users. Therefore, yesterday's applications for concentrated yarn distribution by private yarn factories were not as enthusiastic as the previous time.

### Cotton Cloth Sold at a Loss · Also Due to Excessive Advances

The cloth market opened extremely weak, and prices only stabilized at noon. The reason is that the Spinning and Weaving Factory approved the distribution of goods the night before, and many factories and dealers were rationed with non-branded fine cloth made of 20-count warp and weft. Those who could not afford to advance the money had no choice but to sell at a loss. Therefore, the market price of the goods that the Spinning and Weaving Factory distributed at 53,000 yuan was actually as low as 51,000 yuan. Some dyeing and weaving factories took advantage of the weakness to buy in a lot. According to those familiar with the market situation, the fall in cloth prices yesterday was mainly due to three reasons: (1) Extremely tight cash flow, with interest rates as high as 20%, dealers had no intention of advancing money, and factories also shied away. (2) The Spinning and Weaving Factory sold non-branded goods at a high price of 53,000 yuan, and some rumors suggested that the quality was poor, making those with purchase orders even more cautious. (3) Those who applied to purchase non-branded fine cloth the day before were all approved, but since there were few buyers for resale, they were afraid of losing their qualification to open the letter of credit if they gave up, so they did not hesitate to sell at a loss of 2,000. It was also pointed out that the prices of patterned goods that had not been distributed were still firm. "Four Gentlemen" and tribute satin were sold at 70,000 yuan, and the momentum of grey fabrics was also relatively stable. Observers with status commented that the fall in yarn and cloth prices yesterday was entirely due to tight cash flow. They also pointed out that during the "June-bottom public debt" crisis, the tight cash flow was in the financial industry, but now the financial industry had already anticipated the Mid-Autumn Festival cash crunch and secured itself. Moreover, after the foreign exchange rate fluctuations, the government used contractionary monetary policy to stabilize prices, resulting in even tighter liquidity, leaving industry and commerce with no surplus funds.

### Public Bonds Fall Back

Public bonds were somewhat affected by the news report about the Ministry of Finance's rumors, but a major player on the fifth floor was still reportedly absorbing "Unified Wu" on behalf of a certain bank, and people's confidence remained firm. "Unified Bing" opened in the morning at 2,500 yuan, and Tianjin merchants continued to buy, once rising to 2,680 yuan before being suppressed by selling pressure. It fell to 2,290 yuan in the middle of the day. After that, the situation of "Wu" improved, boosting the buying momentum, and it rose to around 2,450 yuan near noon. As a result, it closed 220 yuan lower than the previous day. Jia, Yi, Ding, and Bing were all pulled down by about 150 yuan.

### Second Half of the Year Relief Rice Our Country Gets 280,000 Tons

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] The International Emergency Food Committee, which recently replaced the United Nations Food Bureau, has decided on the following allocations for relief rice in the second half of this year (totaling 1,324,000 tons): China 280,000 tons, India 270,000 tons, Ceylon 180,000 tons, Malaya 170,000 tons, and the Philippines 145,000 tons. Smaller countries will also be allocated proportionally. The committee also emphasized that the global supply and demand of rice still suffers from insufficient supply. If the rations for July to December are allocated according to regulations, the rice-consuming countries will still have enough to eat.

### High Japonica Rice Rises, Indica Rice Stabilizes

The supply of rice continues, but the declared prices from various producing areas are not cost-effective, and merchants are not very interested. Shops occasionally make small purchases, and Indica rice has entered a stable state. White Yuan rice is scarce and sells well, with prices rising by more than 1,000 yuan. Early-season Japonica rice is already scarce, and late-season rice is being harvested. The supply of goods will inevitably be scarce within the next week. Today, medium-grade rice is the most common, with high-quality rice being rare, and prices rising by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Old white Japonica rice has become unpopular. Registered goods for merchants in the North and South markets total more than 5,000 dan. The Social Affairs Bureau continues to sell Brazilian rice at over 400 bags. Flour shops have turned lukewarm and are slightly weak, falling back by 100 yuan. The digestion of various wheat goods is slow, and purchases are not greedy. All parties are unwilling to sell at a loss due to the inverted relationship between production and sales, forming a stalemate. Soybean shipments from Shantou have stopped, and there are few new arrivals. Xiang Street's appetite is not strong, and high-quality goods are flat, while medium-grade goods have been slightly reduced by 300 to 400 yuan. Corn sales are stagnant, and soybean prices have fallen back by 1,000 yuan. Bran prices have fallen back by 100 yuan. The oil market has risen by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and the approved prices have also been relaxed because producing areas have reported higher prices. Today, all transactions are based on the approved prices.

### Rayon Soars · Up 120,000 Yuan From the Previous Day

Rayon factory sales are active, and bright rayon is even more popular. Yesterday, market prices rose by more than 100,000 yuan. 120-count "Tianqiao" bright rayon opened in the morning at 2.05 million yuan, and after being bought up, closed at 2.3 million yuan. However, buyers continued to flock in, and the price rose to 2.35 million yuan in the afternoon. Finally, fellow traders traded at 2.36 million yuan, with sellers asking for 2.38 million yuan, a huge increase of 120,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Miscellaneous brands also followed suit. 150-count bright rayon was in great demand, and the price also increased by 120,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of other semi-bright and other goods varied by 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Factory-direct sales were quieter, and prices hovered around the same level as the previous day. Although there were transactions in silk goods, market prices were stable with no changes.

### Spinning and Weaving Factory Changes Rationing Method · Will Be Limited to Silk Weaving Factories

Since the Spinning and Weaving Factory began rationing rayon, it has reached the tenth period (rationed every Thursday). Rayon dealers and silk weaving factories could all apply. Now, in order to eliminate the black market and meet the actual needs of silk weaving factories, the company has decided to stop accepting rayon dealer applications from the eleventh period (this Thursday). In the future, rationing will be limited to silk weaving factories.

### White Coal Sales Stagnant and Turning Soft

The arrival of white coal lumps in the coal market is still scarce, but sales are also weaker than before. Market prices are flat with a hint of softness. The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Fuel Committee has reduced the allocation price for Hongji Layer this month by 10,000 yuan, so all grades of white coal have been affected. Although asking prices have not been reduced, sales are extremely sluggish. The arrival of bituminous coal has been hampered by traffic congestion recently. Although market prices have not fluctuated, the market situation is slightly tighter.

### Shrimp Eye Aged Goods Sold Out

Regarding shrimp eye green tea, which is sold to the African region, insiders say that they have been receiving telegrams requesting goods. However, the cost of new goods is high, making it difficult to export, and the inventory of aged tea is about to be exhausted, so transactions have become quiet. However, export firms are still buying aged "Sleeves," aged "Fine Brows," aged "Needles," Fujian black tea, and Keemun black tea. Sales of coarse black tea are also smooth, and market prices have soared to 48,000 yuan per dan.

### Amidst Tight Credit Conditions · Securities Mostly Lifeless

Due to the still fluctuating credit conditions, the public's confidence in Chinese stocks is fragile. When the market opened, it initially rebounded due to the residual momentum of the previous close. Yonghua Yarn rose to 675 yuan after opening, Meiya to 4,030 yuan, Jingfu to 255 yuan, Xinhua to 280 yuan, and Qinxing to 200 yuan. Smaller and medium-sized stocks that are normally less active also rose slightly. However, near noon, faced with profit-taking from many parties, almost all stocks returned to low prices before closing. Among the less active stocks, Sino-French Business surged and showed strong resilience due to a surge in demand, while others were slightly affected. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yonghua Yarn, Meiya, Xinhua, and Qinxing all fell slightly. Jingfu maintained its own position, with many followers, and rose by half a percent alone. The announced asking price for the planned listing is said to be more than double the current price, which is also a strange phenomenon. Among the less active medium-sized and small stocks, Sino-French rose by half a percent, while the rest saw slight declines. Senior stocks were balanced and stable. Business continued to advance.

Foreign stocks saw a sudden drop, and securities firms took profits. Yishui retreated from 10,600 yuan to 9,600 yuan, and British United dropped from 12,600 yuan to 11,300 yuan. Other stocks followed suit, becoming weak. As a result, compared to the previous close, Hutchison Whampoa saw only a slight decline, while Yishui Beer, Yishui Yarn, and Yeguang all fell by about half a percent. British United, Asia Paper, and Kangye all fell by about ten percent.

### Asian Cotton Spinning Market · Japan Remains a Formidable Competitor

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] According to a report from the International Textile Company, one-fifth of Japan's cotton textile production capacity and one-third of its rayon production capacity still exist. Although 70% to 80% of the 12,300,000 spindles that existed in 1939 have been destroyed, four major textile machinery manufacturers still had a production capacity of 800,000 spindles and 16,000 to 17,000 textile machines in 1947. The products they produced in 1946 have not yet been calculated. At the end of the war, Japan's potential rayon production capacity reached 354,000,000 pounds, but due to a lack of raw materials, its production has been reduced to 13,000,000 pounds. The U.S. Department of Agriculture commented that Japan's textile labor force still exists, and if it can obtain a sufficient supply of raw cotton, Japan will be able to compete with China and India in the Asian market.

### Credit Still Not Easing · Gold and Banknotes Stable and Unchanged

The black market rate was stable with little change yesterday, opening around 2.05 million. After the opening, sentiment was still good, and there was no shortage of buyers when prices were low, rising from 2.048 million to 2.058 million. The Central Bank continued to exert pressure, once falling back to 2.045 million, then hovering around 2.05 million. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 182 bars at a price of 2.055 million. After that, it became even more mediocre, remaining above 2.05 million until noon. It was closed in the afternoon. Suddenly, due to extremely tight credit conditions, it was forced down by many profit-takers, falling back to 2.04 million. The next-day settlement was still pulled up to over 2.05 million. As a result, it closed slightly higher than the previous close. Decorative gold, silver bullion, and silver dollars were all flat. The underground interest rate was initially flat, then tightened, with underground interest rates ranging from 17% to 20%.

The foreign currency market was very stable. U.S. dollars opened at 3,290 yuan to 3,310 yuan. They once rose slightly to around 3,315 yuan in the middle of the day. They were still hovering around the 3,300 yuan mark at noon. They then followed the gold market back to below 3,280 yuan, and finally remained flat. As a result, they closed 20 yuan lower than the previous close. Hong Kong dollars rebounded from 690 yuan to around 710 yuan, and finally remained within the 700 yuan range. As a result, they also fell slightly by 5 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was the same as the Hong Kong currency. Indian Rupees were offered at 840 yuan, and British Pounds at 11,200 yuan, with few transactions. U.S. dollars were slightly traded at a slight discount below the listed price.

### The Issue of Thousand-Fold Payment Deposits · Mr. Wang Xiaolai Issues Written Statement

Mr. Wang Xiaolai, member of the National Council of Political Affairs and Director of the Preparatory Committee of the National Federation of Commerce, issued a written statement yesterday regarding the court's ruling on the thousand-fold payment deposit case, saying, "I have just returned from the Northeast, where I was inspecting industry and commerce and providing comfort and relief to our compatriots, and preparing for the National Federation of Commerce. I was just about to publish my impressions of the Northeast when I was asked by reporters for my opinion on the court's ruling on the thousand-fold payment deposit case. I initially declined, saying that I had just unpacked and had not yet studied it in detail. Now, after reviewing the reports in various newspapers, I have the following observations, as their impact is significant."

(1) The Supplementary Regulations on Civil Procedure in Extraordinary Times, promulgated and implemented on July 1, 1941, have become invalid due to the Regulations on Handling Civil Procedure After Reconstruction, promulgated and implemented on December 18, 1945. Therefore, the Judicial Yuan's Interpretation No. 2885, which was based on the now-invalid regulations, and the Judicial Yuan's response to the Executive Yuan on November 21, 1945, No. 3018, are also invalid.

(2) The object of the current Supplementary Regulations, judging from its various provisions, seems to be the occupied areas, because the courts in those areas were unable to exercise their functions and lawsuits could not proceed. This regulation was established to remedy the injustice in society.

(3) Regarding the provision of Article 12 of the current Supplementary Regulations, "If, after the establishment of a legal act, the circumstances change due to reasons not attributable to the parties, which could not have been foreseen at the time, and the original result is obviously unfair, the court shall fairly adjudicate to increase or decrease the payment or change other original effects," it seems that it should first be studied whether there is a regional limitation, because it seems inconsistent in terms of legislative technique.

(4) The legislation of the Republic of China under the Three Principles of the People, judging from the restriction on interest rates and the restriction on inheritance and renunciation of inheritance in the Civil Code, where the spirit and wording lean towards, is clear and does not need to be elaborated. The legislative intent of the aforementioned Article 12 can also be inferred.

(5) As for the circumstances, they should have a scope, and it seems acceptable to say that the devaluation of currency is also a change in circumstances. But where will the special laws regarding currency be placed?

(6) The so-called parties, creditors, and debtors, should all be included. Even if the devaluation of currency is a change in circumstances, this change is common sense and could have been foreseen at the time, but there was no power to resist it, unless one did not love the country and nation and exchanged it for foreign currency, storing it abroad, or setting up materials and houses in the country. Who can predict the reliability and unreliability of these?

(7) In a speculative gambling arena, there are those who release one cent for overseas, that is, one cent per day per yuan, which is 36 yuan per year, and even in ten years it is only 360 yuan. It seems too unfair to have to return 1,000 yuan for one yuan in less than ten years.

(8) If one yuan is not used as one yuan, then in the past when money and foreign currency were used together, those who borrowed foreign currency clearly wrote on the IOU that they borrowed foreign currency and would repay foreign currency, which seems to be much more sophisticated than the gold clause that was later canceled in the United States. Moreover, if currency loses its unified and unchanging nature, how can transactions succeed, and how can drafts, promissory notes, deposits, and loans be realized?

(9) How China's monetary system will be reformed in the future is currently very difficult to predict, but it will definitely not be like Germany and Britain after World War I, restoring the gold standard, because managing currency is in line with Sun Yat-sen's monetary revolution.

(10) This article concerns economic provisions. If loans must be increased, then farmers, industry, and commerce will all go bankrupt. I dare say that these people are all debtors, which is certainly not the original legislative intent of the Supplementary Regulations.

### Purchasing Raw Silk · Initially Based on 10,000 Dan

[Report from this newspaper] The government's order to purchase raw silk and send it to Shanghai has been recorded in previous newspapers. It is now known that the China Trust Bureau, the Central Bank, and the Bank of China have been discussing detailed measures for days. It is reported that the principle has been determined to purchase 10,000 dan of superior raw silk, with a purchase price of 3.8 million yuan per dan. Detailed procedures will be announced in the near future.

### Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and Agricultural Bank Jointly Establish Agricultural Machinery Company · Kong Xiangxi Serves as Chairman

In order to improve agriculture in our country and increase production, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Farmers Bank have jointly initiated the establishment of the China Agricultural Machinery Company. The company's machinery and equipment will utilize the agricultural machinery allocated by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), and technical assistance will also be provided by UNRRA. The company has now been formally established, with Kong Xiangxi, Chairman of the Bank of China, serving as Chairman, and Zhou Yichun, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, serving as Vice Chairman. Li Shuming, General Manager of the Farmers Bank, Qian Tianhe, Vice Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Shen Xirui, Deputy Director of the Central Trust Bureau, and Wu Rencang and Pan Guangjiong serve as Managing Directors. Zhi Bingyuan has been hired as General Manager. The capital is set at 400 million yuan. The company will also establish several agricultural machinery factories, distributed throughout the country. It has been decided that the main factory will be located in Shanghai, and branch factories will be established in 18 locations, including Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Nanjing. The site of the main factory is located in Jungong Road, and the factory buildings have begun to be renovated. It is expected to start operations next month, initially manufacturing simple farm implements to meet rural needs, and selling them to farmers at low prices.

### Tianjin, Hankou, Sichuan, Hunan, and Other Merchants Search for Bleaching Powder and Bleaching Powder Essence

Bleaching powder and bleaching powder essence prices had previously plummeted due to the abundance of arrivals in the Shanghai market. For example, a small bucket of bleaching powder essence weighing 100 catties had once reached a price of 630,000 to 640,000 yuan per bucket, but two weeks ago the price had returned to 120,000 yuan per bucket. Those holding large quantities of orders were also forced to sell at a loss of 80,000 yuan per bucket. Bleaching powder was even more miserable, with prices falling from over 300 yuan per pound to 120 yuan, which was actually cheaper than lime in Shanghai. This prompted merchants from Tianjin, Hankou, Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other regions to buy up the goods. Recently, prices have been rising gradually due to the strong purchasing efforts. According to industry insiders, the import cost of bleaching powder essence is approximately 170,000 to 180,000 yuan per bucket, so it will be difficult for prices to fall in the future. Merchants from outside Shanghai mostly specify brands when purchasing goods. For example, bleaching powder essence must be the German "Ili Dun," and caustic soda must be the British "Moon" brand. American goods are generally not preferred. However, almost all goods on the market now are American goods because many factories in Shanghai have switched to using American goods. Therefore, it seems that out-of-town merchants' prejudices against brands have diminished.

### The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Suggests Simplifying Banknote Designs · Aiming to Make Them Easier to Identify and More Difficult to Counterfeit

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly received reports from various industry associations in this city: Recently, counterfeit banknotes have been found on the market from time to time, and even a moment of carelessness can result in loss. Now, the Import and Export Chamber of Commerce has also sent a letter stating that they have also discovered similar incidents, although the losses are still minor, but there is concern that they may escalate over time. To prevent future troubles, please formulate comprehensive measures to eliminate unnecessary losses for both payers and receivers. The Chamber of Commerce submitted this to the Standing Committee meeting, which resolved that the current variety of banknote designs, with different sizes, makes it difficult for users to distinguish them, affecting the promotion of legal tender. They have sent a letter to the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank, requesting that the design of banknotes issued in the future be simplified and standardized in order to reduce the chances of counterfeiters succeeding and to make it easier for users to identify them.

### On the Zhoushan Archipelago · Third-Class Naval Port · First-Class Fishing Ground

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng, Dinghai, August 24

Dinghai is the main island of the Zhoushan Archipelago. All 185 islands are under the jurisdiction of Dinghai. It is located in the southeastern sea of China, the closest part of Zhejiang to Japan, and the gateway to the southeastern coast of our country, the maritime fortress of the entire nation. During the late Qing Dynasty, Germans were hired as consultants to design and build the navy, making Dinghai a naval base. Many forts were built, scattered across various important islands. During the Opium War, Dinghai was occupied by the British army. Later, after repeated negotiations by the Qing government, Hong Kong was exchanged, and the British finally left. Before leaving, they took the gun bolts, rendering the defensive artillery ineffective. All the way until the start of the Anti-Japanese War, when the enemy invaded Dinghai, these many cannons were not used. After the enemy occupied it, they melted down the iron cannons to cast other types of guns and cannons. The old base still exists today, making people feel extremely ashamed.

### The Enemy's Measures in Dinghai · Countless Thoughts

The Japanese valued the Zhoushan Archipelago highly, so they built roads to connect the entire territory, built shipyards to repair warships, excavated soil, arranged naval docks, installed steel pipes to transport fresh water to the sea, stored military supplies, increased military equipment, and occupied civilian land to open an airfield with an area of 1,600 mu. They also deployed a strong sea and air defense base on Siqiao Island, because Siqiao Island is a necessary sea and air route. A repair factory was also set up on the island, and several amphibious aircraft were often stationed at the airport, with a large number of torpedoes and suicide boats prepared, intending to fight a desperate battle on this sea and air island.

According to local people, "Japanese warships were often anchored in the port when the Japanese were present." These large warships were about 3,000 tons, because the draft could not be too deep. Now, according to the navy, "Only a few warships of more than 500 tons, and many gunboats, have been received. The gunboats have a displacement of only 25 tons and are used to launch torpedoes. There are also 60 suicide boats, and a lot of other food, ammunition, weapons, and equipment." The suicide boats are now piled on one side of the airfield. These suicide boats have very small bodies and very large bows. The explosives are stored in the bow. They advance at a very fast speed, driven by one person. If they encounter a warship, they rush towards the ship regardless of everything, inevitably resulting in mutual destruction. Inside the airfield, there are three seaplanes scattered, but no one is using them, allowing them to rot. In view of all the enemy's facilities in Dinghai, we have countless thoughts. Here, we are glad that the enemy surrendered unconditionally earlier, otherwise Dinghai would have been reduced to ashes in the enemy's desperate battle. We are glad that the enemy did not destroy anything in Dinghai, but instead made military construction in Dinghai.

### Chinese Young and Strong Air Force

During the arduous and lengthy eight years of the War of Resistance, no one can deny the merits of the Air Force. These airborne heroes not only displayed unparalleled bravery in their duties, eliminating tenacious enemy bandits, but also won back considerable honor abroad. No one believed that flying Stearman training planes could cross the Hump, but our Air Force safely arrived in China; no one believed that the young Chinese Air Force could perform formation flying with letter formations, but we accomplished the most difficult letter formation. No one believed it was possible to fly to Japan, with its solid air defenses, to fight, but we flew across the ocean and delivered humanitarian bombs. Their footprints reached as far as India, Britain, and the United States. Their perseverance was enough to amaze and surprise allied nations, and to inspire admiration and awe in the enemy!

They can't forget the cradle of the Chinese Air Force – Jianqiao in Hangzhou. Therefore, every time the "September 1st" anniversary of the academy is celebrated, even if they are far away, they must have a fervent celebration.

Now that the War of Resistance has been won, they have returned to their alma mater's base. This cradle of the Chinese Air Force, which made a huge contribution to the War of Resistance, should be the most revered sacred place in the hearts of all our people.

The following pictures show how the Chinese Air Force grew from adolescence to adulthood during the arduous and lengthy eight years? Chu Yusheng.

### Defensive and Offensive: The Best Third-Class Naval Port

Naval Captain Yang Daozhao, the special commissioner stationed in Dinghai, told me, "With equipment like that in Dinghai, it can only be said to be an important naval port, not quite a naval base. However, the enemy's intention was to use this place as a naval base, because the entrance here has islands as a barrier, and the harbor is calm and tranquil, making it defensive and offensive. It's indeed the best third-class naval port."

Naval Major Xu Kuizhao, the chief of staff, was also beside me. He said to me, "The enemy prepared to attack from here, and only defend when absolutely necessary, as can be seen from their preparations for suicide boats, torpedoes, and gunboats. At the same time, the main island of Zhoushan, Dinghai, is surrounded by small islands, making the terrain treacherous, the sea passages winding, allowing for concealment. If large warships are encountered, they can hide near the small islands after attacking, making it difficult for the large ships to counterattack."

I know that US Army General Kirk has been here. He praised the terrain here very much, saying that Dinghai is actually the outpost of Xiangshan Port, and its importance exceeds that of Xiangshan Port. We feel immense interest in this Dinghai, which is rich in military value; Dinghai City is built on the main island of Da Zhoushan, surrounded by fertile fields, small hills, and trickling streams. The streets in the city are clean, and although the buildings of the shops are old-fashioned, they are also very neat, quiet, and free from hustle and bustle. There are 420,000 people on these 185 islands, half of whom are engaged in fishing.

### Large Fishing Grounds and Cold Storage Plants: Fish Production Around 6 Million Dan

Dinghai is also one of China's three major fishing grounds, namely the South China Sea fishing ground of Hainan Island, the Yantai fishing ground of the Yellow and Bohai Seas, and the Dinghai fishing ground of the Zhoushan Islands. Dinghai's fishing industry has four major types: large yellow croaker fishing, small yellow croaker fishing, ribbonfish fishing, and cuttlefish fishing. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has specially set up a Fisheries Bureau here, sending Rao Yongbi as the director, to manage the fisheries of the 22 counties along the Zhejiang coast, with a coastline of more than 600 nautical miles. Dinghai's fish production alone is more than 6 million dan per year, with more than 30,000 fishing boats. When we came here, it was the cold season, and most of the fishing boats had gone to carry passengers and goods, and there were still some fishing boats moored on the coast of Dinghai, with masts standing in forest formation.

I visited the cold storage plant, which is for cold storage of fresh fish for fear of spoilage. The plant is divided into separate cold storage rooms. After the fish are caught from the sea, the abdomen is cut open and the intestines are removed, and then they are placed in the cold storage room. They are lined up on freezing pans, allowed to freeze, and then placed in cold air rooms to keep them at the lowest temperature so that they do not melt, and then cut into strips of frozen fish that can be sold or transported outside.

Most of the fishermen are poor. Therefore, the fish market lends money to the fishermen, or the fish wharf lends money to the fishermen. When the fishing season is harvested, they must still sell all the fish to the lending fish market, which then buys them at a low price. The fishermen can only sell them with pain and tears. There are also fish factories that transform fish into salted or dried products themselves, and they also lend money to fish markets, which in turn lend money to fishermen, or lend directly to fishermen. Then, the fish market lends money to ice-fresh boats, and the ice-fresh boats lend money to fishermen. After the fishing season, the boats collect fish from the fishermen and sell them to the fish markets. These fish markets all have commissions to collect, and all exploit the fishermen. This is also an old habit from hundreds and thousands of years ago, and the fishing methods are also old methods from hundreds and thousands of years ago. The fish markets only know how to make commissions and high-interest loans, and do not know how to improve the methods. The fishermen, in a situation where they are struggling to make a living, can only stick to the rules.

### Poor Fishing Season, Expensive Ice and Salt: Anxious and Nowhere to Go

We went to Shenjiamen, a prosperous area of the fish market, for investigation. According to acquaintances, the fishing boats on both sides were full during the fishing season, and even ships could hardly pass through. Ashore, we saw that the buildings on both sides of the street were very neat, and there were also Western-style buildings. The streets were relatively wide, but our noses were filled with the fishy smell and a mixed stench of human urine and sewage.

There are more than 80 fish markets here. This year, due to a strong wind, no fish were caught, which has not happened in 20 years. The money lent out by the fish markets cannot be recovered, so they are crying out for help to rescue the fishermen.

This year, the price of ice is high, the highest is 50,000 yuan per dan, and the price of salt is also high, more than 7,000 yuan per dan. The high price of ice affects the ice-fresh boats, and the high price of salt affects the lives of fishermen. Moreover, the sea is not peaceful, and people often ask for "passage money" or extort "protection fees." The poor fishermen fish like they are stealing fish, and if they don't fish, they can't pay back their debts. The fishing season this spring was bad, and the fishermen are even more anxious and have nowhere to go.

### The Zhejiang Fisheries Bureau Has Just Been Established: New Topics Should Be Worked Hard

Most of the fishermen's fishing boats are not their own. They also rent them from others and return them to the lessors for repairs after the fishing season. The boat rental is certainly not low. I heard that the rental for a boat is 40 dan of rice. Therefore, a fish goes through many processes and is exploited a lot from the time it is caught to the time it is eaten.

After the grand fishing season, the fishermen get a little money, because of the resentment in their hearts, they drink and gamble heavily, and some even go whoring. They just want to have a good time. It's really "live for today, for tomorrow we die"! Nine out of ten fishermen are illiterate, and those who are literate do not become fishermen. They are well-dressed and are the "spokespersons" for the fishermen.

Now, the Zhejiang Provincial Fisheries Bureau has just been established. How to improve the lives of fishermen? How to improve fishing methods? How to reduce the exploitation of middlemen? How to protect the safety of fishermen? These are all topics that they will work hard on in the future.

The Zhoushan Islands, a good naval port and a large fishing ground in China, are facing difficulties, and we hope to be able to solve them so that this series of islands along our coast can exert their strength! (Written on the boat to Putuo)

Car Deaths Should Have a Special Chapter

Dear Editor: Since the victory in Shanghai, car deaths have become increasingly rampant. I hereby write to the Shanghai Municipal Government regarding this matter, and would appreciate it if you could publish it. (Omitted above) It has been found that the number of car accidents in Shanghai is gradually increasing. Since the collision between a US military vehicle and a car, which resulted in the death of Mr. Chen; subsequently, cars have crashed into tram stations or into walls. These are just the most shocking examples. Countless rickshaws, pedicabs, and pedestrians have been hit by cars, resulting in severed heads, broken arms, and splattered brains. The number of accidents can accumulate to three to five times a day, and the death of Ms. Cheng Dingjun, the widow of martyr Zhang Yongchun, the former secretary of the Party Committee, and her second son, Zhang Pingsun, is particularly tragic. If a person is hit by a car because they are lingering in the middle of the road in an area with heavy traffic, it can be attributed to their own fault. However, if a person is walking on the sidewalk and is also met with tragedy, then there is no other way to avoid disaster other than to stay at home all day long. Pedestrians, no matter where they are walking, and no matter what vehicle they are riding, are in a precarious situation, with danger at every turn. In my opinion, even if traffic regulations are well-organized in the future, it is still impossible to guarantee that cars will not cause accidents. Considering that Principal Cheng was killed in an area that was not particularly congested, it seems that separate regulations should be made regarding the elimination of car accidents. I will now present my humble opinions in separate articles: (1) Investigate the nature of the car causing the accident in detail to determine the method of negotiation. The police station has records of which organization the car belongs to, but according to newspaper reports, most of them are US military, National Army, and UNRRA vehicles. It is proposed to conduct strict negotiations to ensure that they comply with the regulations and avoid causing accidents. (2) Limit the speed of travel and prescribe a penalty for violations to prevent accidents. The cause of car accidents is mostly due to excessive speed, and the type of vehicle is mostly jeeps. Jeeps are originally military vehicles of the Allied forces, equipped with the best machines, and are extremely agile when driving on the battlefield. However, what is the need to open the throttle and drive straight ahead at this time and place? It is proposed to clearly prescribe the speed of travel and prescribe a penalty for violations, and instruct the police station to strictly crack down on violations. The speed should be reduced at night and on roads with sparse traffic to avoid accidents. (3) Prohibit ten-wheeled trucks from driving in the city center. Ten-wheeled trucks were originally tools for transporting goods on highways in foreign countries, and should not be allowed to pass through the city. Moreover, the streets of Shanghai are narrow and congested, and it is easy to cause accidents when driving in them. It is proposed to find a way to prohibit them to ensure safety. (4) Conduct strict screening of drivers of special agencies in a uniform manner to ensure caution. Whether the Chinese, Russian, and drivers hired by the US military and UNRRA, and the drivers of military agencies, have been issued driver's licenses by the police station in accordance with the regulations, and whether they are under the management of the police station, cannot be known. However, since they are rushing around, killing people like flies, measures should be taken to crack down on them. It is proposed to instruct the police station to conduct strict screening in a uniform manner, and to give them earnest warnings when issuing licenses, so as to ensure that they act with caution and avoid causing accidents. (5) Strictly prohibit overtaking to maintain order. Before the War of Resistance, the patrolmen in the concessions strictly prohibited cars from overtaking. Not only was the order well-maintained, but there were also fewer accidents. Now, cars are driving in the road, vying to be first, and the order is chaotic, resulting in injuries and collisions. It is proposed to strictly prohibit this. (6) Crack down on hit-and-run cars: Cars in Shanghai often do not stop to rescue the person who was hit after causing an accident, but instead open the throttle and flee, resulting in panic and injury to several people. If this situation is not effectively curbed, then what will become of the safety of pedestrians? It is proposed to instruct the police station that if a hit-and-run car is encountered in the future and refuses to stop, a warning shot should be fired immediately. If the driver still refuses to comply, the tires should be shot out. At the same time, this method should be communicated to the US military and the National Army headquarters, requesting them to pass on the message to all drivers. (7) Strictly punish the drivers who cause the accidents to serve as a warning: There were not many car accidents in the era of concessions. The punishment for drivers who injured pedestrians was only a fine. Now, the number of accidents is high and fierce. The tragedy on Bixun Road this time resulted in two deaths, plunging the family of martyr Zhang Yongchun into a desperate situation, and leaving orphans without support. Such a vicious driver, even the death penalty is not enough to cover his crime. How can a small fine be enough to settle the matter? It is proposed that in the future, the police station should file a public prosecution with the court for negligent homicide against the drivers who cause the accidents, depending on the severity of the circumstances, to punish them and to serve as a warning. (8) The municipal government should jointly launch a safety campaign with the municipal party committee, hang slogans in the streets, and print leaflets in Chinese and English to advise drivers, or add illustrations, and distribute them to drivers by the patrol police to raise awareness. The above is only a general overview. The municipal government has the authority to decide how to formulate the regulations in detail, which is beyond the ability of citizens to do. Now, the car killings are still continuing. If we do not act quickly to prevent them, then who can stay at home and feel safe? Please convene a meeting urgently and implement these measures immediately. Even if they cannot be completely eliminated, they should be reduced considerably. (Ding Ruihou)

### Worry-Free Drinking Water in the Western District

On August 23rd, the Reader's Opinions column of your newspaper published a section about citizen Zhao Yongnian et al. requesting the installation of a free tap water outlet in Meijiaqiao Lane, Zhuanbang, Jiangsu Road. It has been found that the water pipes laid in the Tingsu Road area are of small diameter and have insufficient water pressure, making it difficult to get water. If more taps are installed, it will be even more affected. Therefore, it is difficult to install them in the area at present. However, in order to take care of the drinking water of the poor, the Bureau has now notified the Shanghai Water Company to open three fire hydrants free of charge for emergency needs: (1) Zhuanbang, Jiangsu Road East, (2) Middle Zheng West Road (between Dihua Road and Jiangsu Road), (3) near Yugu Village, Jing'an Temple Road. Please publish this to let everyone know. (Public Utilities Bureau, August 31)

### Judgment on Japanese War Criminal Takashi Sakai Continued from page 9 of yesterday's newspaper

Also, John Allerdice Dugan, a lieutenant in the artillery and a member of the Allied Southeast Asia Command's 43rd Cemetery Registration Group stationed in Hong Kong, excavated dozens of corpses of murdered prisoners of war in cemeteries in Stanley, Wong Nai Chung Gap, Repulse Bay, and other places in Hong Kong. In addition, rusted iron wires that had been used as handcuffs were found in the piles of remains, and photos were taken as evidence. Furthermore, Mrs. Zhao Shujia, the wife of Zou Lu, and Mrs. Cheng Muzhen, the wife of Zou Yue, who were present at the scene, went to court and described the atrocities they witnessed at the time in vivid detail. In addition to the testimony of witness Qiu Riren, who clearly proved that the troops under the defendant's command committed acts of abuse, rape, and plunder in the Kowloon area, as well as the cruel act of releasing dogs to bite people, there is also a report from Rafael R.M. Lavale, the representative of the Argentine Consulate in Hong Kong, which can be used as corroborating evidence.

Regarding the robbery of our country's treasured books, there is also a letter from the National Peking Library that can be used as evidence. In summary, the defendant's implementation of the war of aggression in North China and Hong Kong and Guangdong, and the wanton acts of the troops, are clearly proven and undeniable. Although the reasons he gave for his defense are as follows: (1) He said that the request to withdraw the troops stationed in Hebei and to dismiss the head of the Hebei administration was based on the Boxer Protocol. (2) He said that he participated in the war on the orders of the Japanese government. (3) He said that he was not aware of the atrocities of his subordinates, so how could he be responsible? However, regarding the first point, the Boxer Protocol does not prohibit our country from stationing troops in Hebei Province, nor does it give Japan the right to demand the dismissal of the head of the Hebei administration. As for the fourth paragraph of the Tianjin Exchange of Notes attached to the protocol, it only sets a limit of 20 li between the places where the Chinese and Japanese troops are stationed in Tianjin in order to avoid conflicts between the Chinese and Japanese troops. The defendant actually used this article to claim that Japan had the right to demand that our country withdraw the troops stationed in Hebei and dismiss the head of the Hebei administration, which is a deliberate distortion. Regarding the second point, a war of aggression is an act of destroying international peace, and even if the defendant participated in it on orders, he cannot shirk his responsibility. Moreover, during the war, the troops committed wanton acts, which is a violation of international laws of war. How can he excuse himself by citing government orders in the hope of being relieved of responsibility? Regarding the third point, according to international practice, the commander of the war has the responsibility to strictly supervise and control the actions of his subordinates. The defendant's negligence in supervising the actions of his subordinates and neglect of his supervisory responsibilities is already difficult to excuse. Moreover, he supervised the war in Hong Kong and Guangdong for nearly two years, and the atrocities of his troops spread throughout the Southeast. It is even more unreasonable to say that he has heard nothing about it. Moreover, according to the confession of his captured subordinate, Colonel Kinzuke Noma: "We were originally limited to two days to capture Hong Kong, but because the advance of the army was slow, it took eight days, and we were severely reprimanded. Lieutenant General Sakai must have known all the atrocities of the Japanese army," as well as the sworn statement of Stanley Martin Banfill, a captain medical officer in the Canadian Army Medical Corps stationed in Hong Kong: "A Japanese officer named Honda, who was proficient in English, stated in person that military orders were like mountains, and all prisoners of war must be killed." And the defendant's admission during the trial that he knew at the time that his troops had killed prisoners of war in St. Stephen's Hospital, it is sufficient to show that the defendant knew about and condoned the atrocities of his subordinates. The large-scale massacre on Hong Kong Island was due to the fact that it took eight days of siege to land, and the accumulated anger was difficult to dissipate, so he did not hesitate to do this to show revenge, which is also clear. What else is there to hide? All of his defenses are nothing more than cunning attempts to shirk responsibility, and are not acceptable at all. To respect the independence, sovereignty, and territorial and administrative integrity of China is clearly stipulated in Article 1 of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. And to condemn war as an instrument of national policy, Article 1 of the Pact of Paris clearly states. The defendant first incited treacherous parties to disrupt Tianjin and force us to withdraw our troops and dismiss administrative officials, and advocated the independence of the five provinces of North China. After leading his troops to fight in Xuzhou, Guangdong, he supported puppet troops and promoted the power of the puppet government, and always participated in the war of aggression, usurping our country's sovereignty and destroying our country's territorial and administrative integrity. It is clearly a violation of the above-mentioned international provisions and should be found guilty of disrupting peace. Therefore, he is punished by analogy with Article 101, Paragraph 1 of our country's Criminal Law, which deals with the crime of seizing national territory and usurping sovereignty by means of violence. As for his atrocities during the war, such as massacring prisoners of war, wounded soldiers, Red Cross doctors, nurses, and other non-combatants, as well as rape, robbery, deportation of civilians, abuse of torture, and destruction of property, are violations of Articles 4 to 7, 23 (3), 23 (7), 28, 46, and 47 of the Hague Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, and Articles 1 to 6, 9, and 10 of the Geneva Convention. Although there are corresponding provisions in our country's Criminal Law that can be used for analogy, the defendant repeatedly knew about and condoned the atrocities of his subordinates, intending to establish prestige by abuse and conquer the people to achieve the purpose of his war of aggression. His general criminal intent is very obvious. All the atrocities of killing, raping, and plundering are just manifestations of his entire wanton behavior, that is, the realization of his general criminal intent. Based on the principles of the concurrence of laws and the superiority of special law over general law, all kinds of atrocities should be summarized and punished by analogy with the provisions of Article 34 of the Criminal Law of the Army, Navy, and Air Force regarding the crime of wanton behavior. Moreover, the defendant disrupted peace and participated in the war of aggression, thereby violating humanitarian and war regulations. The crimes are related in terms of method and result, and should be punished with the more serious punishment. The defendant deliberately engaged in aggressive work, repeatedly using insidious means to collude and provoke, causing the July 7th Incident at Lugou Bridge, which led to this World War. It has become an unprecedented catastrophe in history, which is a violation of international justice and a destruction of world peace. Moreover, during the war, he trampled on Hong Kong and Guangdong, and wherever the weapons went, the people were devastated and the villages were turned into ruins. In particular, the cruel methods of disembowelment, gouging out eyes, slicing, and cutting up corpses were applied to prisoners of war, disabled soldiers, rescue workers, and innocent civilians, which is even more tragic and is the scourge of mankind and the enemy of civilization. He should be sentenced to the most severe punishment to show deterrence.

Based on the above conclusions, the judgment shall be made in accordance with Articles 1 and 8 of the War Criminals Trial Regulations, the first paragraph of Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 1 of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, Article 1 of the Pact of Paris, Articles 4 to 7, 23 (3), 23 (7), 28, 46, and 47 of the Hague Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, Articles 1 to 6, 9, and 10 of the Geneva Convention, Article 34 of the Criminal Law of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, Article 101 (1) of the Criminal Law, and Article 55 of the Criminal Law. The prosecutor of this court, Chen Guang, performed his duties in court.

### World Aviation Hub: Hong Kong

— Our Hong Kong Air News on the 24th, Special Correspondent Ling Fang

According to Reuters, British Airways' airship "Hamilton" is scheduled to depart from London's Poole Airport on August 24th, carrying 16 passengers on an 8,352-mile flight to Hong Kong in four days. This marks the opening of the company's Far East "Dragon Line." Subsequently, there will be one flight per week, directly from England to Hong Kong. Soon, an additional flight per week will be added, and the route will extend from Hong Kong to Shanghai, with its final destination being Tokyo.

The Important Position of the Dragon Line

After the war, the "Dragon Line" of this American airline was the beginning of formal scheduled air routes between Hong Kong and various parts of Europe and the United States. After the British army re-entered Hong Kong, they took Kai Tak Airport back from the Japanese army and started to develop Ping Shan Airport, planning to establish a world aviation hub in Hong Kong. After three years of operation by the Japanese, Kai Tak Airport had 3,000 civilian houses in Kowloon City demolished to build two runways, each 2,000 yards long, in a cross shape, sufficient for the take-off and landing of four-engine giant transport aircraft (before the war, there was only one runway of 800 yards), but it was not enough to accommodate the latest giant mail planes. Therefore, the British authorities decided to choose the rural area of Ping Shan in the New Territories to rebuild a large airport with runways 5,000 yards long. However, the villagers of Ping Shan were determined to oppose it, resulting in the internationally shocking Ping Shan Airport incident. The British government announced its abandonment of construction in April of this year. The British had built an airport in Kam Tin in the New Territories before the war, but it was limited by the terrain and could not be expanded. It is said that another location has now been selected, preparing to build a large airport that meets the standards of modern international civil airports, with a construction cost of four million pounds, expected to be completed in 30 months. Due to funding and other relationships, the Hong Kong government and the British Colonial Office are still discussing it, and it is currently impossible to announce when construction will begin. The location of the new airport is also kept secret by the Hong Kong government, but it is probably within the New Territories leased from Baoan County in our country.

An Amphibious Airport

Before the construction of a standard large airport, Kai Tak Airport can still take on the current responsibility of Hong Kong's air harbor. According to an experienced pilot, Kai Tak Airport is comparable to Shanghai's Jiangwan Airport and surpasses Guangzhou's Tianhe Airport. Kai Tak Airport, with Lion Rock on one side and Kowloon Bay on the other, is an amphibious, well-equipped aviation station, which is beyond the reach of ordinary airports that only serve land-based aircraft.

The Equipment of the Hamilton

British Overseas Airways Corporation's London-Hong Kong route uses airship flights. The "Hamilton," which is departing for Hong Kong today, is equipped with four engines, weighs 55,000 pounds, carries 16 passengers, and has a crew of six. It has a speed of 170 miles per hour. The interior has 16 beds and 16 sofa chairs, divided into four rooms. The upper floor has another room with a bar, dining room, kitchen, and toilets, with a modern layout and convenient supplies. It departs from Hong Kong every Wednesday, with a one-way ticket price of £170 and a round-trip ticket price of £306. The freight rate is 17 shillings per kilogram. Excess baggage costs £1 14s per kilogram. Transportation between London and Hong Kong will be even closer. Before the war, British Overseas Airways Corporation's Far East route was mainly the England-Australia route, with a Singapore-Hong Kong branch line built for connection. Therefore, this direct flight between London and Hong Kong can be considered the first in history.

Pan American's Statement

Before the war, in addition to British Overseas Airways Corporation, Pan American Airways also had a station in Hong Kong. On the day the Pacific War broke out, Pan American Airways' "Clipper Hawaii" became a victim of Japanese bombs on the side of the water station at Kai Tak Airport. Before the war, Pan American Airways' trans-Pacific route departed from San Francisco, via Honolulu, Midway Island, Wake Island, Guam, Manila, and to Hong Kong, taking six days for the entire journey. After the war, due to the lack of agreement on Anglo-American aviation rights, flights were delayed. Hong Kong mail to the United States is only transferred via England. In the past, there were rumors that the United States planned to set up a station in Macau to replace Hong Kong, but the US Consulate in Hong Kong has formally denied this news to reporters. Recently, Anglo-American Far East aviation rights seem to have reached a compromise. Pan American's staff in Hong Kong said a few days ago that aircraft will be dispatched to resume direct flights between Hong Kong and the United States within two months, but still waiting for the approval of the Civil Aeronautics Board in Washington.

It is said that Pan American Airways has divided the trans-Pacific route into north and south lines after the war. The northern route goes via Honolulu, Alaska, Tokyo, Shanghai, and to Hong Kong. The southern route goes via Honolulu to Australia, the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, Manila, and to Hong Kong. Pan American Airways has recently dispatched an aircraft from the United States across the Atlantic, via Europe, to India, officially opening the New Delhi line as a section of the global route. In the future, it will extend to Singapore, connecting the North Pacific or South Pacific line to complete the global flight, and Hong Kong will become one of the main communication stations on the global route.

Development of Hong Kong Air Routes

In addition to China, Central, British Overseas and Pan American Airways, Southwest Airlines, Philippine Far Eastern Shipping Company, and Asia Airlines will soon establish air routes in Hong Kong. (The Far East Shipping Company dispatched a "Sky Master" giant aircraft on the Philippine-Hong Kong maiden voyage today, safely arriving in Hong Kong, the entire journey costing only two hours.) The Manila-Hong Kong routes of the latter two companies have been unofficially open for many times. China Airlines is also interested in dispatching aircraft to open the Hong Kong-Singapore and Hong Kong-Calcutta routes. The Far East air network centered on Hong Kong has now been gradually completed. Chinese, British, and American aviation industries are bound to set off a fierce competition.

In order to adapt to this new environment, the Hong Kong government is scheduled to restore the Far East Aviation Training School attached to Kai Tak Airport next month, to cultivate aviation talents. The school was established several years before the war, and more than 100 Chinese students have graduated from it, most of whom are now serving in the domestic aviation industry. Most of the old staff of the school have returned to Hong Kong, and in the future, it will be renamed the Far East Aviation Training Academy, officially starting enrollment on September 1. The school's curriculum is divided into flight and mechanical classes. According to Mr. Qu, the chief engineer of the academy, at the beginning of the school's reopening, the instruments and various parts are not yet complete. It is planned to open the flight class first, and the mechanical class must wait for various equipment to arrive before resuming. The school has ordered three new training aircraft from England, which will be shipped to Hong Kong next month.

Planning to Build a Large Airport

Because of its superior geographical conditions, Hong Kong has been one of the world's major ports in the age of maritime transport. After the war, the age of aviation has begun. The Hong Kong government is catching up, planning to build a large airport that meets the standards, in an attempt to maintain its position in international transportation. Just as maritime transport requires deep-water harbors, air transport requires a vast base. Guangzhou cannot compete with Hong Kong in the former, but Hong Kong cannot compare with Guangzhou in the latter. After the war, international air routes mostly used land-based aircraft instead of seaplanes, and the American C69 giant land-based aircraft cannot land at the current Hong Kong airport. It is rumored that Pan American Airways has recently shifted its target to Guangzhou. Whether this is true remains to be proven. However, we must coordinate with the objective environment and intensify the rectification of Guangzhou's aviation facilities. This time, we must not let Hong Kong take the lead in aviation transportation!

### Evidence of Guilt

— Zheng Jia'ai

By Luo Binji, First Edition, August 35th Year

The first collection of literary works recently published by Minsheng Bookstore consists of ten books, one of which is Luo Binji's novella, entitled "Evidence of Guilt," with a total length of about 40,000 words.

After the victory, Luo was first familiar to Shanghai readers with his collection of short stories, "The Spring of Beiwangyuan"; his gentle, delicate, and very unique style was loved and imitated by many young people who loved literature and art. At the same time, the material was realistic and full of strong local characteristics, which was undoubtedly a precious harvest in the barren literary world. Compared with "The Spring of Beiwangyuan," "Evidence of Guilt" is much more serious in terms of content and style; although the latter lacks the warmth and fragrance of spring, it still allows us to smell some of the breath of spring, while "Evidence of Guilt" is like a heavy brand iron, pressing on our hearts; cold and heavy; those unpleasant nightmares are clearly reflected in front of us; in the disappointment after the victory, the past hatred, coupled with the crisis facing us, who can not tremble and fear? Many bloody killings have passed, and many lives and treasures have been lost cheaply; these seem to have just disappeared, and seem to have been long ago; but it is definitely not a dream. In the sounds that humans can hear, we finally hear the most miserable delirium, which is caused by oppression and threat, the delirium of warriors; they are still trapped in their own dark houses, constantly defending, begging for forgiveness, and roaring; they have never committed a crime, but they are punished more cruelly than the death penalty; the protagonist in "Evidence of Guilt" is encountered like this:

In the spring of 1931, Wu Zhan Kui graduated from a senior high school in the North, with a passionate thirst for knowledge, as well as the hope of life in a big city. He was admitted to the Faculty of Law of Peking University. At school, he was not interested in politics and never had any activities. He took his books on time every day to attend lectures in the classroom. During holidays or spare time, he often went to the theater to listen to Peking Opera. After the show, he often sighed, which was an expression of his inner praise and happiness. This winter, he planned to go to his hometown outside the Guan to spend his holidays. "He felt light-hearted for the first time, and saw the endless snowfield under the winter sky for the first time. Those grass branches with the tips of the wooden handles exposed, those cold sparrows flying low on the snow, thinking of the passage of time, thinking of being away from home for a year, the days of being a guest in a foreign country, thinking of the little friends in his hometown, I am afraid that they have changed with the years." Wu Zhan Kui smiled. He felt how he should work hard so as not to waste this precious youth... He did not begin to notice the influence of the Manchurian Incident on himself until he was processing his "entry certificate" (to enter Manchuria) in Tianjin; Puyi's return to the capital was not just something in writing. On the evening of arrival in Dalian, Wu Zhan Kui and eleven other intellectual youths had their "entry certificates" withheld, and they were interrogated by Chinese interpreters. Without proof of the facts, without room for defense, based only on the enemy's own suspicions, he was sent to prison with shackles added to his legs; in the five years, Wu Zhan Kui grew old and haggard: "His eyes showed great restlessness and emptiness. He no longer had academic desires, and also lost the arrogance of his youth. It seemed that he had no desire for anything in the world. He just paid attention to the light in the small window, to see if it was time to distribute the prisoners' rations, listening to the footsteps in the next room, listening to see if new prisoners were being locked in, or if old prisoners had the happiness of being interrogated. Occasionally, swallows flashed by, and he knew it was spring, but spring was so far away from him. Occasionally, a fallen leaf appeared in the courtyard, and he felt it was autumn, but autumn was so vague."... It was not until the day of the "Manchukuo King's" amnesty that he was suddenly released. At the moment he was released from prison, he was dizzy with the broad road, crowds, livestock, vehicles, green trees, bright lights, and the fiery sunset and the evening haze by the sea. After Wu Zhan Kui was taken back to his hometown of Hunchun by his sister Yu Fang, his mind was always dazed. All the friends he could remember had changed. His teacher, Li Hancheng, had become a rogue by smoking opium; his good friend Jin Liwu was also an opium addict: and he never stopped talking about business, always wanting to cooperate with the Japanese to make big money. His energy could no longer make him pay attention to these trivial matters. All he could hear clearly was what Jin Liwu said when he left: "Secret agents are secretly investigating you." Therefore, Wu Zhan Kui became confused in an instant. He could not stay at home in peace, nor could he sleep. He was completely mad, and his hands were tied with hemp ropes by his father and locked in the room. That night, Zhan Kui's father, Dapeng, hurried to the Korean area to collect soybeans, preparing to make more profit when Japan and Russia (Soviet Russia) went to war; but he lost his way and went to the Korean border. He was detained overnight and escorted by Japanese police the next day, and fell ill.

In the end, Wu Dapeng died, Zhan Kui went mad, and Yu Fang also stopped talking much. She always worked silently and depressed. They had never committed a crime. Where did the "evidence of guilt" come from to punish them? When I finished reading this book, I truly felt that the most desired thing for mankind is the word "truth"; when will fascism, and the demons similar to it, be eliminated? It killed innocent young people, making them neither dead nor alive, and suffered mental abuse and trauma; some people say: "Only crazy people are happy, they can laugh and cry without scruples." But the delirium and dull eyes of madmen clearly reveal eternal sorrow. Some people say: "Society is suitable for the survival of the not-too-strong and not-too-weak, and all mediocrities will not go mad or perish... Only madmen go to perish, because he is strong and weak, he is weak, but he thinks he is strong... It is said that most people who go mad now are young people." Therefore, we need to fight for the years that young people should enjoy, and they cannot be arbitrarily oppressed and driven mad!

In this novel, Luo Binji temporarily put away his delicate writing style, but still retained the characteristics of fluency and delicacy. He vividly portrays the psychology and actions of madmen. We can very likely imagine how a faithful literary artist, when he described those cruel facts with blood, tears, and indignation, passionately held the feeling of "accusation"; yes; he is "accusing," "accusing" this "trumped-up" "evidence of guilt."

### What is the Future of International Law?

— Sun Hang

In the spring of 1942, while the whole world was still anxiously troubled by the war, some well-meaning people from the United States and Canada had already begun to discuss post-war reconstruction issues. They were a group of international law scholars, about two hundred in number, who held eighteen meetings successively in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington, San Francisco, and other places. The central question discussed was, "What should the future of international law be?"

After thorough and repeated discussions, they published a report as their common opinion. This report was edited into a book by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, entitled "The Future of International Law." Mr. Wu Zeyan of our country has translated it into Chinese, and it has been published by the Commercial Press.

In addition to the introduction and preface, this book is divided into three main parts. The first is the foundation of future international law, "which is the indispensable premise for establishing and maintaining an effective legal system in the international community." The second is the principles of future international law, which can be "a draft of a declaration on the future of international law." The third is the proposals for future international law, which are "some measures that can be adopted to implement the above principles."

The first two parts are relatively abstract and theoretical. Therefore, in terms of practical contributions to international law, the final proposal is undoubtedly more concrete and valuable.

The development of international law should be in line with the changes in the world situation. Sometimes, after mankind has suffered enough lessons and pain, they want to save themselves, and even want to create international law that can be used to obtain peace and security, in order to lead the changes in the world situation. Therefore, the development of international law not only depends on the development of international relations, but also needs to take human wisdom and needs as driving factors.

For this reason, international law should no longer be an involuntary product like customary law. It should be a man-made tool to help develop the future of mankind. If mankind wants to use international law to lead the world from war to peace, they must deliberately create international law, rather than recognize customary international practices.

This book is a kind of creation for international law. Its words are based on the standpoint of world peace and legal order. In some places, it is revolutionizing the existing international law; in some places, it is fundamentally establishing a new kind of international law.

(1) Revolutionizing Existing International Law—A very complex issue in international law is the relationship between national sovereignty and international law. According to the traditional view, a country is a member of the international community, and international law is binding on it, but only with its consent. In other words, a country can consider whether a certain international law will harm its sovereignty and decide whether to adopt it. This tradition has great shortcomings, because in this way, international law is subordinate to sovereignty, and international cooperation and order must also be based on national interests.

In the past, many people have proposed to reduce national sovereignty to suit international cooperation, such as Professor Laski of the United Kingdom. Now, this book has a further proposition. The latter part of its third basic principle states: "A country's sovereignty is subject to the limitations of international law." Isn't this revolutionizing the traditional international law?

(2) Creating New International Law—The binding force of international law is often weak, because it does not have a legislative and judicial body like domestic law. Although the Permanent Court of International Justice was established, nominally there was a judicial body, but the legislative body has always been lacking.

Proposal 7 of this book states: "The General Assembly, by a two-thirds vote and with the consent of the Executive Council, shall have the power to amend the general rules of international law and to implement new general rules of international law." This is the legislative body of international law, a new creation in international law.

Looking at the whole book, there are many such revolutionary and creative arguments. For those who like to study international law, or, in other words, for those who are concerned about mankind, this book is indeed a valuable reference for forming your thoughts or methods of saving the world.

Around the World

### The Reconstruction of Libraries After the Calamity

— Translated by Zhao Zhen

In order to revive the intellectual life of the people in the war zones, the United States is now providing a large number of books and magazines to libraries and academic research institutions in Europe and the Far East. In order to rebuild the libraries that were arbitrarily and deliberately destroyed by the Germans and Japanese, American public and private organizations have been collecting a large number of academic books and magazines, preparing to ship them to various countries. In this war, the total number of books destroyed and lost is more than two hundred million. In Poland, 70% of the libraries were destroyed or looted. In the Czech Republic and Yugoslavia, more than half of the libraries were destroyed. The Soviet Union lost 50 million volumes of books. In China and the Philippines, in addition to seizing the books they needed and taking them back to Japan, the Japanese destroyed all the other books.

The scholars and experts in the war-torn countries have lost contact with the new inventions and new progress in academics. They know that there have been great and numerous inventions in science in recent years, but they have no way to study them. Therefore, universities, educational organizations, libraries, and government agencies in the United States started collecting books at the beginning of the war, so that they could be transported to various countries after the war.

The Rockefeller Foundation's Donation

In May 1941, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Library Relief Group of the American Library Association ordered a complete set of magazines to donate to the affected countries. Since 1941, the American Library Association has used 300,000 US dollars to order 365 specialized magazines, with an annual subscription of 35,710 periodicals, of which more than 90 are medical magazines. These magazines and other magazines donated by various organizations and individuals have been shipped to various countries.

In terms of books, the Rockefeller Foundation has allocated 200,000 US dollars to purchase 35 sets of specialized works, each with 750 specialized books, to be sent to China, Britain, Russia, France, Italy, Poland, the Czech Republic, etc. Now, a book order list has been prepared, selecting 1,600 specialized reference books, especially new books published in the last ten years. Among them, books on natural sciences and applied sciences account for 60%, and books on humanities and social sciences account for 40%.

As the relief agencies and relief plans in various parts of the United States are increasing, in order to make good use of funds and cooperate closely, there is a need for a central agency that can make overall plans. Therefore, in April 1945, the "American Book Relief Office" was established in the Library of Congress in Washington. Its task is to coordinate foreign library relief work, investigate the destruction of foreign libraries and their needs, collect books, and contact transportation ships. The "American Book Relief Office" plans to ship 1 million to 3 million books and magazines abroad in 1946. These large numbers of books are all donated by the American people. They are now conducting a fundraising campaign to solicit more than 400 specialized magazines, and each of the 48 states has a book collection station.

Efforts of Various Governments

The governments of various European countries have ordered a large number of books in the United States. The Chinese Ministry of Education has also ordered 20 sets, each with 195 specialized magazines. 80% are ordered for the National Peking Library, and 30% are ordered for the National Geological Survey. National Tsing Hua University has ordered new books worth 12,000 US dollars.

The Soviet Union has also ordered several kinds of books and magazines in the United States, each with 60 copies.

Although the relief work for libraries destroyed in the war zone is mostly the effort of private individuals, the US State Department has also assisted countries in the Near East and the Far East. While the war was going on, the State Department sent photographic copies of 75 specialized scientific magazines to China every month. At that time, transportation was extremely difficult, and these relief supplies had to be transported to China by air over the Himalayas. Since 1937, the books donated by the US State Department to China have been worth 50,000 US dollars.

### Book Arrangement

— Wei Yan

The Library of Congress in the United States is now busy soliciting books from the publishing industry across the country, classifying and sorting them, and then distributing them to many countries in the world that are recovering after the war. This shows that the Allied countries are developing all aspects of post-war construction in a balanced way. However, in our country, we unfortunately discovered a tragic contrast. It is said that when the Shanghai Municipal Museum was first taken over, there was nothing but a few empty rooms. The person in charge was also unable to develop it due to the shortage of municipal funds. Of course, it seems superfluous to talk about cultural construction in a country where even food is not enough. However, national construction should be developed in a balanced way in all aspects. We must consider the needs of the current society, but we must also prepare for the permanent plans of the future. This preparatory work should start with academic research.

Speaking of academic research, we feel it is too pitiful. Not only can we not talk about experimental instruments, but it is impossible to find a few more books to read. It can be said that there is not a complete library in any university in the country. It is unnecessary to say that the ancient books that were scattered after the war cannot be collected again. Even if we want to find a complete library that collects the latest publications in the country, it can be said that we have searched everywhere and cannot find it. The atmosphere of scholarship is not strong enough in the first place. In addition, a few people who want to read are either short of money to buy books or have no place to borrow books. How can this society progress?

Therefore, we hope that the state can take out a part of the money to purchase foreign books and distribute them to the libraries of major cities and universities across the country; in terms of the domestic publishing industry, it is best to donate new books to major libraries or give them a large discount each time they publish; establish a relatively complete library in each city, and do more work in organizing and collecting books. We must maintain China's spirit of establishing the country with culture for thousands of years.

Spring and Autumn

### Talking about Kunqu Opera's "Mountain Slope Sheep"

— Zhao Jingshen

When I learn to sing Kunqu Opera, I often encounter "Mountain Slope Sheep" in the Shang tune. The most popular ones are "Broken Bridge" from *The Tale of the White Snake* at Leifeng Pagoda, "Hiding the Boat" from *Fisherman's Joy*, "Startled Dream" from *The Peony Pavilion*, and "Asking About Illness" from *The Jade Hairpin*. The singing methods of the latter two operas are not very similar to the former two; the former has excitement in sorrow, while the latter has tapestry in sorrow. The Shang tune belongs to autumn, which originally has the autumnal feeling of solemnity or sorrow.

Because I can sing "Mountain Slope Sheep," I reviewed all the "Mountain Slope Sheep" in the *Collected Opera Scores*. Based on the only ten operas available, plus "Asking About Illness" from other opera scores, it may be dangerous or not very reliable to draw conclusions. I will write it down for now, in order to make a more detailed summary in the future. The special phenomena I have seen are as follows:

(1) Two large "Mountain Slope Sheep" can be independent suites. And they do not have a coda.

Liang Chenyu's *Washing Gauze* "Raising Horses" is like this, and *The Jade Hairpin*'s "Asking About Illness" is also like this.

(2) "Mountain Slope Sheep" is often linked to other palace modes, and rarely linked to the Mu mode.

In these eleven operas, "Mountain Slope Sheep" is often followed by Xianlv, Xianlv entering Shuangdiao, Shuangdiao, Zhengong, Zhonglv, Huangzhong, Yuediao, and even the Yu tune, but only "Broken Bridge" uses the Shang tune.

(3) "Mountain Slope Sheep" is most often linked to Xianlv or Xianlv entering Shuangdiao.

*Occupying the Flower Champion*'s "Selling Oil" "Mountain Slope Sheep" is linked to Xianlv's "Soap Gauze Gown," "Sobering Up Sweet Ganzhou," and "Soap Bean Looking at Hometown." However, a song "Jade Embracing Abdomen" with Xianlv entering Shuangdiao is inserted before "Soap Bean Looking at Hometown." *The Shepherd's Tale*'s "Watching Sheep" "Mountain Slope Sheep" is linked to Xianlv entering Shuangdiao's "Night Boat Sequence," "Black Hemp Sequence," "Brocade Clothing Fragrance," and "Pickled Vegetable Order." *Leifeng Pagoda*'s "Broken Bridge" is linked to Xianlv entering Shuangdiao's "Five Offerings" and "Jade Intersection School," with two songs of the original tune "Golden Bridle" attached at the end. *Double Red Tale*'s "Stealing Silk" "Mountain Slope Sheep" is linked to Xianlv's "Soap Bean Son." *Tonsure Tale*'s "Tonsure" "Mountain Slope Sheep" is also linked to Xianlv's "Second Offense by the Dressing Table," but two songs of the Zhonglv mode, "Moth to the Lamp," are attached at the end. Xu Zhiheng's *Easy to Know Opera Rules* Volume 2 has a few words that are well said: "Mountain Slope Sheep' belongs to sad songs, but if it is first sad and then happy, then Xianlv or Xianlv entering Shuangdiao can be connected, depending on the plot." Watching Sheep until freezing and starving, this is sadness, but eating the fairy's gift will not be hungry, this is happiness; Lady White blames Xu Xian for being ungrateful, for not letting Fahai bully her, this is sadness, but after meeting, she feels pity again, this is happiness; Selling oil for a living is sad, but seeing the Flower Champion at first sight seems to increase new vitality, this is also happiness; Hongxiao complains in her boudoir, waiting for her lover not to come, this is sadness, but she is carried away by Kunlun to meet Cui Sheng, this is also happiness. Tonsure does not fully conform to this statement, so it is not discussed.

"Mountain Slope Sheep" is connected to other tunes: "Hiding the Boat" is connected to Huangzhong's "Descending Yellow Dragon" and "Yellow Dragon Rolling," and "Startled Dream" is connected to Yuediao's "Mountain Peach Red" and "Cotton Batting." The Flower God sings Huangzhong, which can only be regarded as an interlude of a supporting role. *Jingchai Tale*'s "Crying Shoes" has the most chaotic connection, the order is: Xianlv entering Shuangdiao's "Rowing Boat" two songs, Yu tune's "Better than Flowers" one song and Yuediao's "Remembering Tiger Sequence" two songs. *Pipa Tale*'s "Eating Bran" is connected to Shuangdiao's "Filial Son" four songs and Zhengong's "Wild Geese Passing Sand" three songs. It seems that the first song cannot always be separated from Xianlv entering Shuangdiao or Shuangdiao.

(4) "Mountain Slope Sheep" is often used in two consecutive songs, and rarely used alone.

"Mountain Slope Sheep" is used in two consecutive songs in: Eating Bran, Watching Sheep, Stealing Silk, Crying Shoes, Raising Horses, Hiding the Boat, Broken Bridge, Asking About Illness eight operas, and only Tonsure, Startled Dream, Selling Oil three operas are used alone.

### Home

— Tang Xialing

(1)

I haven't been home for more than two years, although it's only two or three hundred miles away from home. But not a day goes by that I don't miss home.

My parents, with their white hair, will be seventy years old next year. I haven't seen their kind faces for a long time. I wonder how much their health has deteriorated as they lean on the door every day, thinking of their wandering son? This is the first thing that I can't help but feel sad about.

My father's tomb has already arched up. I should also go back to offer two bowls of wheat rice and burn some paper money. After a person's death, what other meaning of tracing back to the ancestors can the children express besides this?

Although my wife is an ugly woman, we have had a close and loving relationship for twelve years since we got married. Especially those two little children, pulling on their mother's clothes, pretending to cry, and asking me when I will return?

Because of these concerns, I plan to go home once every day.

(2)

My brother sent me a letter last month.

This letter in my heart is like a bloodstain carved by a sharp knife. Every time I think of it now, it still makes me cry out in pain.

One passage in the letter reads:

——You haven't been back for more than two years. Everyone at home misses you very much, especially your mother. Her health is getting weaker day by day. Whenever she thinks of you, tears well up in her eyes. Mother is afraid... I can't bear to say it: In short, come back and see her soon! Your two children are indeed lovely! Sometimes they look up with their little faces, pull on their mother's clothes, and ask: Mom! When is Dad coming back? Their expressions are so innocent, sincere, and eager for an answer——

At that time, I felt a pang in my heart! Hot tears rolled out of my eyes. At this moment, I seemed to see my mother holding a cane, sitting weakly in a chair. Looking at her melancholy and pale face, I felt that my mother was even older. The old lady didn't say a word, but her eyes were filled with tears of kindness. My wife was doing needlework next to her, and she also lowered her head, with hot tears falling one after another like pearls. The two children saw the adults like that, froze for a moment, and finally opened their little mouths inexplicably and cried out with a "wah" sound. The whole room was filled with an atmosphere of sadness and a mood of sorrow, which made me even more sad!

I lay on the table, not knowing how long I cried.

The sound of the midday cannon liberated me from the encirclement of sadness. At that time, I clenched my fists and resolutely asked for leave to go back.

I didn't expect that I have delayed until now and haven't gone north yet.

(3)

The year before last, I went home and stayed for a few days. The taste was really very uncomfortable!

My hometown is not very peaceful.

The heavy taxes and corvée labor forced people to become bandits all over the place. Killing and robbery are simply a nightly occurrence. My family is poor now, so I'm not afraid of bandits coming to rob us, but I worked in the local administration for two years, offending the heroes of Liangshan, which may be inevitable. Seeing their cruel methods, it really made me anxious and unable to sleep peacefully at night.

At the same time, I went back with empty sleeves, wearing old and worn coarse cloth clothes. Although my family members were not as snobbish as Su Ji's parents, wife, and sister-in-law, looking at my own shabby appearance, I always felt a little embarrassed.

Especially those old men in the countryside, who love money the most; they heard that I was back and came to my house to see me. After a few vulgar greetings, they began to ask me: "How much salary do you get in a month? How much money did you bring back this time?" It seemed that life was all about money. I returned with empty pockets, which really made them embarrassed to ask. A feeling of disgust and contempt immediately floated in my heart. But I had no choice but to smile faintly.

My mother understood my pain and said from the side:

—Money! He may have several thousand a month, but he doesn't live like we do at home, saving money. He has many young friends outside, and he spends a lot of money on socializing. Our family is poor anyway, and we can't get rich with ill-gotten gains. I don't want him to mess around with money, because those who exploit the people will not have prosperous descendants! He has a few fixed salaries, so where would he have any money left? The travel expenses for his return this time will probably have to be raised at home—

Indeed, no one in the family wants me to make money, even though we are poor.

Such a family really gives a lot of spiritual comfort to the wandering son who returns sick and poor!

(4)

I didn't have any money to bring back home, and on the contrary, my return added some burden to the family. It wouldn't matter if the family was rich.

Some relatives, friends, and neighbors all came to see me, from early morning to late at night. There were always guests in the house. When it came to mealtime, of course, I had to treat them to a simple meal. Although there was nothing good to eat in the countryside, a few cooked dishes, half a catty of rice wine, and some steamed buns were the least I could offer. These expenses, plus a batch of travel expenses for my return, and the family buying more than two dan of grain,

Drinking rice wine and not getting enough sleep made me feel exhausted and hoarse, unable to continue.

I could only sleep until midnight, and as soon as the rooster crowed and the dog barked, I would panic and get up to listen. When I was sleeping well in the morning, my wife would come to the room to call me, saying that there were more guests outside. Although I felt a little annoyed in my heart, I felt that people were coming with good intentions, so I had to get up, rub my eyes, and go out. I didn't even have time to take a nap at noon. Everyone knows that I can drink alcohol. When guests come to the house, I can't help but entertain them diligently and drink with them to their heart's content. Guessing the numbers, drinking non-stop for several days, I couldn't help but drink a little too much. So on the fourth day of my return home, my eyes started to become red and swollen, and my throat became hoarse at the same time.

(5)

The eight years of the Yellow River disaster made my hometown suffer beyond description!

Many neighbors who used to live here have now fled to escape the famine. In the bitter north wind, some tattered and low thatched huts: a few adults and children with emaciated faces and bird-like bodies, wearing ragged clothes, came out, holding small baskets and ropes, and crouched down to dig for vegetables and firewood on the hill. Their appearance was very pitiful! But they still had to struggle on the line of hunger and cold.

Even in such a miserable situation in the countryside, the corrupt officials still had to scrape!

The reception fee for the Bao Public Office was two or three thousand yuan a month. The beasts in human clothes were eating and drinking the last drop of blood from the common people.

To pay 50 catties of public grain, you have to prepare 80 catties on an old scale in advance. Their scales are like modern publications, specially made in extra-large sizes.

I don't know how many young men the country wants, and they have to pay for it several times a year. But it's also cheap, as long as you are willing to send two coins, you will be safe and sound immediately. They want to make a living for their families, so they give gifts according to their ability.

A family just bought a few liters of soybeans, preparing to cook them with vegetables, but the Township Soldier adult came and took them away, saying that the army needed horse feed

In addition, they squandered, embezzled, and simply did everything. It made people angry after hearing about it. But I didn't have the financial resources or time to come out to help them and file a complaint for our compatriots, to fight for justice. In fact: they are all connected from top to bottom, colluding with each other. Even if I come out to make trouble, it won't do any good. Unless I am a sword fairy or a knight-errant, who can kill people with flying knives.

I am a small coward, a poor civil servant, who likes to be quiet, has a soft heart, but also has a bit of foolishness. How can I dare to go back to such a dangerous, money-worshipping, frequently entertaining, full of scars, gloomy and dark society?

(6)

The family is full of love, warmth, which makes people intoxicated and forget all the hatred, animosity, and all sins in society.

In my hometown, society has revealed its dark side. The common people are struggling, groaning, and wandering on the line of hunger and cold. Corrupt officials are sucking human blood, eating the bones and flesh of their compatriots. After eating and drinking their fill, they let out a triumphant grin.

The taste of going home is like eating a licorice root, it is sweet at first, but there is also some bitterness in the sweetness.

But I still want to go home.

I want to return to my loving mother's embrace: let her kind hands caress me, caress my whole body, and immerse me in the sea of kindness and love; so that my body and mind can be revived.

At my father's tomb, I want to cry my heart out! But not just for myself.

Leading my two children: I want to learn from Lao Laizi in front of my mother, dressing in colorful clothes to amuse her. When my mother sees it, she will definitely laugh out loud, and maybe hug me in her arms and call me a good son.

My wife will laugh even more and open her cherry-like mouth.

How happy the family is! I want to go back quickly!

However, many terrible shadows of my hometown suddenly come to my mind again.

### Female Soldiers

— Carved by Renfeng

### Climbing Mountains and Paving Roads

— Zhong Yuan

When I was a child, I heard an old gentleman with gray hair say this: "Life is a desolate mountain, and the long, boundless years are the chaotic, rugged stone steps on that mountain. When I was young, I panted and sweated on this desolate mountain, yearning for the wonders and flowers at the summit, fantasizing about beautiful white clouds and blue skies, desperately climbing and climbing, ignoring the sharp rocks and thorns under my feet, forgetting the cliffs and deep valleys on both sides, just single-mindedly climbing until I was old, climbing up, and with great difficulty, I reached the summit. But alas, when I reached the summit and looked, there was nothing there, and I was heading down the mountain!"

Is life really so empty and illusory?

For many years, I was indeed perplexed and doubtful because of that gentleman's words; whether in the dripping rain of late night or in the faint white light of early morning, I never forgot: I am climbing a mountain! I am not afraid of panting and sweating, nor am I afraid of sharp rocks, thorns, cliffs, and precipices; I am only afraid that when I painstakingly climb to the summit, there will really be nothing there, and I will be heading down the mountain! - How sad I would be then!

Fortunately, I suddenly found an answer:

It was a lovely young friend who once drew a picture in my autograph book with her slender little hands. In the picture, there was a strong man wearing a straw hat, paving a long road in a desolate wilderness. He held an iron shovel in one hand, removing the rocks and bricks in front; and in the other hand, he held seeds of flowers, scattering them all the way. So, in the places where he scattered them, beautiful roses and fragrant roses bloomed, colorful butterflies danced in front of the flowers, and lively little birds flew high in the sky...

My friend did not inscribe any words on the painting, but this profound revelation was enough! ——

I am not climbing a mountain, I am paving a road!

God has not prepared a ready-made beautiful summit for anyone; God has only given anyone an iron shovel and a packet of flower seeds, telling them to create for themselves, to pave a road filled with fragrant flowers!

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng 23

Chapter Three: Oath

The night is deep.

The sound of artillery in the southern suburbs of Beiping gradually stopped; the sound of gunfire also went from sparse to sporadic, and then stopped.

Looking at Beiping from the suburbs, under the cover of clouds, under the roaring artillery fire that resounded across the fields, and the sudden silence that followed, this ancient city was as quiet as a tomb that had been around for a thousand years. If you were to think of its once prosperous scenes of dragons and tigers vying with each other, of wind, bridges, and battle horses, you might inevitably feel melancholy for it.

From dawn to sunset, to late at night, the people of Beiping, with tense emotions, on the one hand, resisted the tides of events that repeatedly washed over them, and on the other hand, secretly inquired about each other, "What exactly is the situation?" At the same time, they also had to grasp the jobs that sustained their three meals a day and continue to do them; until they picked up their tools, closed the doors, yawned, and with a little worry, climbed into their beds or kangs.

A certain part of the people in the city, a certain special "chosen people," we can freely use "living in a drunken dream" or "intoxicated by wealth" to describe them; it is only these people who are intoxicated or dreaming, I don't know whether they have lost their souls, or whether they are nostalgic for the last bit of the former capital's prosperity that has already declined, painstakingly supporting the ending of this daily, final climax - the "The End" of the movie theater, the "Please Come Again Tomorrow" of the garden, on the edge of the Eight Great Hutongs, Han Antan, may be able to hear the last cry of "Customer—" or "See you tomorrow, sir," in an excessively shrill voice.

All of this has passed, and the huge city can be said to have superficially stopped its activities.

I say "superficially" because there is also an "inside." In this "inside," there are at least two forces that are still actively striving towards the peak of the climax at this time: one force is excitedly discussing how to continue the great massacres, "sweeps," and "total reductions." But one force is very calmly planning how to save this human catastrophe.

At this time, if you were standing on the enemy tower of Chongwenmen, you would see a man of medium build, wearing an untidy Western suit, dragging his heavy steps, but very alert, walking out of Dongjiaomin Lane. He seemed very tired, because he came from the southern suburbs, winding his way through several layers of scattered gunfire, experiencing at least three risks, and a considerable amount of trouble.

If you followed behind him, you could see this lonely and cold shadow walking to the end of Dongjiaomin Lane, onto Chongwenmen Street Avenue, pausing slightly, looking around, and then walking towards Dongdan Archway.

At this time, he suddenly felt his steps lighter and his legs full of energy; because although the streetlights in Beiping were dim, he could vaguely see a six-story building standing less than an arrow's shot to the east. This was the destination of his trip. On each floor of the building, there were still one or two dim lights, adorning a glimmer of life in Beiping.

When he reached the opposite side of this tall building, he stopped. As far as his eyes could see, he couldn't see a single figure at either end of the street. Believing that the situation was suitable, he then raised a hand, as if casually, scratching his hair a few times, and tidied his collar, then lifted his light footsteps, nimbly crossed the street, and walked straight into the half-rolled gate.

Free Talk

### To Mr. Rong Desheng

— Shaofu

Mr. Desheng:

We are very sympathetic to your suffering from danger; and being able to safely escape from the difficulties is indeed a matter worth rejoicing over!

You have escaped danger, the bandits have been brought to justice, and the efforts of the military and police authorities in investigating and preventing the crime, all those who have read the full report of the Garrison Headquarters cannot help but praise and admire the diligence, bravery, agility, and tireless spirit of the staff engaged in handling this case. This is your good fortune, a guarantee of the safety of the citizens, and even more the glory of those responsible for maintaining law and order!

Although the matter has ended, it is said that there are still some small loose ends to be dealt with. These loose ends are the ransom paid by your family to the kidnappers, which was seized by the Third Front Army and the Investigation Department of the Police Bureau Garrison Headquarters, totaling more than 240,000 US dollars. It is said that this stolen money should be returned to the kidnapped person according to law, and the Garrison Department has notified you to go to the Military Law Department of the Garrison Department today to claim it.

Whether such a situation "legally" requires a return is for legal scholars to answer, but for your sake, I am afraid it is not necessary to claim this money back. The reason is nothing more than: (1) When your family took out this money, the purpose was to get you out of danger, and they never intended to get it back. This is just like the old Chinese saying, so-called seeking "wealth gone, person safe and happy"; (2) To take a step back and think, if the kidnappers had spent all the money before the case was solved and it could not be recovered, wouldn't that also be a very likely thing?

Therefore, we would like to suggest that you establish a "Desheng Scholarship" with this money to help those students who have no money to study. In this way, not only will those students who benefit be grateful for life, but the country and society will also benefit from it.

Recently, the schools are desolate and tuition is expensive, you can't not know this; the movement to respect teachers, the education loan, the Uncle Ping Public Scholarship, and the efforts and appeals of many other enthusiastic people, you can't not know this either. More than 240,000 US dollars, converted to about 784.4 million Chinese yuan at the current legal tender exchange rate of 3350, is not a small amount. If you agree with this matter and implement it immediately, the effect it will produce is immeasurable.

We admire your achievements in the real estate industry, and we are even more confident that after you understand these reasons, you will have the determination to help the out-of-school youth in Shanghai today. Therefore, we are willing to appeal to and suggest to you!

Mental Hygiene

### How to Cope with Melancholy: Suppression or Release?

— Guiting

"Everything must be held in moderation, excess will cause harm!" - The motto of mental health.

Some people are very calm, it seems that even if Mount Tai collapses in front of them, they will not move. But some people are the complete opposite, even if they are slightly stimulated, they will be restless and at a loss. In fact, from a physiological and psychological point of view, these two types of people may be equally nervous.

In the environment we are currently in, nervous stimulation is absolutely unavoidable. Our question is: how can we properly release these nervous energies to avoid excessive tension.

Methods of Release

There are roughly four ways to release nervous energies to avoid excessive tension: (1) To dilute nervous tension with muscle movement, so many small movements are made, such as chewing gum, shaking legs, or making gestures, etc., (2) To release nervous energies from the mouth with sound, such as singing, boasting, or talking and laughing; (3) To maintain external calmness by consuming body tissues, resulting in unexpected obstacles to the normal movement of the internal organs. Therefore, many people who cannot arbitrarily release their emotions due to their social status, such as business owners, professors, lawyers, etc., are usually the most susceptible to digestive and heart problems; (4) Another type is the method of conceptual movement. These people always like to fantasize all day long, researching some ways to solve problems in empty castles in the air; sometimes they turn over in their minds how to deal with people who insult them. This also belongs to this type of way of releasing nervous tension.

Muscle Movement

Of these four types of ways, muscle movement is the most effective. We have also noticed that the nerves of laborers are never as tense as those of office workers and office staff. For example, workers who hammer stones never suffer from insomnia. As for conceptual movement, it may sometimes be able to adapt to the environment and be beneficial. But its harm has two aspects: (1) Because this does not require consuming much physiological energy, it still fails to reduce excessive tension, (2) Fantasizing too much may sometimes reach the point where one cannot distinguish between dreams and reality. The effect of reducing nervous tension by using sound from the mouth is in between the above two, and this is the easiest way to dispel the melancholy in the chest. Maintaining external calmness by consuming body tissues is the most undesirable way, because nervous tension has nowhere to release, and the result can only develop inward, attacking the relatively weak internal organs, and then all kinds of diseases arise, such as heart disease, indigestion, headache, etc.

Do Not Suppress Excessively

The biggest mistake in our current life is to close the outlets that nature has given us to release nervous tension, and we never try to find other outlets. The following suggestions may be helpful to people suffering from nervous tension. First, we can change our lifestyle to reduce nervous tension. In particular, vigorous exercise is very effective. Second, we sometimes have to choose the ways to release nervous tension, so that they can exert the greatest effect in special situations. For example, if you accidentally knock over an ink bottle and make a mess everywhere. At that time, you can grumble a bit, or be busy using blotting paper to dry it, to release the stimulation you have received mentally. Then, needless to say, the latter method is more suitable. This is called "special adaptation" in psychology. Third, we can sometimes also use supplementary actions unrelated to the current environment to release mental tension. The following example can serve as proof. Two classes of college students participated in the exam. One class was ordered to sit quietly and take the exam without making any movements; while the other class was allowed to move freely or make any sound. As a result, the students in the latter class chewed gum, waved their hands and feet, and made all kinds of movements during the exam. And the students in the other class became so nervous that they became hysterical. Therefore, after we are mentally stimulated, it is best to go to the garden for a walk, go to the kitchen to bake cookies, or even bite our nails or play the piano randomly.

Repeated Attempts

This is always more beneficial than putting our palms together, pretending to be happy, and showing off our self-control ability. Fourth, if you have tried the above methods and they have not worked, you can use the method of "repeated attempts." This is also a term in psychology, and its principle is: "If you fail at the beginning, you should try again once or countless times." Fifth, the most important motto for mental health is: "Everything must be held in moderation, excess will cause harm." For example, we get up early in the morning, eat a hearty meal, or exercise, and then bury ourselves in solving arithmetic problems. At first, the spirit is excited, and the sharpness and speed gradually increase. But to a certain extent, the mind will become dull, and eventually even completely collapse. Therefore, when we are "in moderation," that is, when we are not too nervous, it is the most effective and easiest time to do work.

The case of the naval soldier killing the tram conductor can be seen as an example of "vigorous morale."

When the foreign exchange was adjusted, Mayor Wu once strongly stated that it would not affect the prices of daily necessities. At the end of August, the city government announced the cost of living index, which was indeed similar to that of July. Only then did we know that the mayor was not deceiving us.

I remember a prophet once said: "There will be no summer this year." His prediction was indeed correct. Look, isn't the hottest weather this year not in summer but in autumn?

"The Master was gentle, kind, respectful, frugal, and yielding, and thus he attained it." This motto, if used when riding trams and buses, is sufficient to become "The Master was gentle, kind, respectful, frugal, and yielding, and thus he lost it."

### Indian Dignitary: Nehru

— Xizhi

Britain has finally allowed India's independence at the Simla Conference. The current Chairman of the Indian National Congress, Nehru, has accepted the invitation of the British Governor-General Wavell to serve as the organizer of the transitional government for India's independence, leading India towards true freedom and equality. Here is some information about Nehru:

As far back as the eighteenth century, his ancestors moved from that highland area to the fertile plain area. This ancestor, named Raj Kaul, was a prestigious scholar of Persian and Sanskrit, highly valued by the emperor of the then Mongol dynasty, and moved to the imperial city of Delhi, and even received a fief, including a residence on a canal. Therefore, the word "Nehru" (meaning canal) was linked to the name of this ancestor and became part of his name. Later, the word "Kaul" was gradually canceled, and we simply call him "Nehru."

This clan went through several periods of prosperity and decline. As a result, the fief was exhausted. Later, it was affected by the Indian national revolutionary movement of 1857 and lost everything. His grandfather and two uncles had no choice but to join the refugee group and flee to Agra. At this time, India was occupied and ruled by Britain with tyranny, until today.

His father, in his later years, hated the British tyrannical rule over India, resolutely abandoned everything, and became a fighter for Indian national liberation, fighting for Indian national liberation, but died of overwork in 1931.

From his childhood, he was often influenced by the ideas of his cousin, filled with resentment towards foreign rule. At the same time, he was also influenced by his tutor Brooks (an American). In 1905, at the age of sixteen, he went to England to study at Harrow School; then he transferred to Cambridge University to study. He liked literature and books, and loved the works of Oscar Wilde (a British aesthetic writer at the end of the nineteenth century). At the same time, because he wanted to defend the Indian revolutionaries who were in American prisons at that time, he also seriously studied law.

In 1912, at the age of twenty-three, he returned to China and immediately participated in the national movement. He was the leader of the Indian Muslim community. When the non-cooperation movement occurred in 1921, he enthusiastically supported this movement, which led to his first arrest and imprisonment. To date, he has been arrested as many as seven times. In prison, he was treated relatively leniently, because he was allowed to read and write, which instead became a good opportunity to study political economy, turning him into a socialist thinker. After more than ten years of struggle, his position in India has become increasingly lofty. The entire Indian people respect and love him only after Gandhi. He is not only a loyal believer of Gandhi, but also Gandhi's only successor. His wife, Kamana, is an outstanding woman who was imprisoned for following her husband in the revolution, and therefore her health deteriorated and she died in 1936. He has a daughter named Medina, who is a student studying in the United States.

In order to promote the friendship between China and India. During our country's war of resistance, he seriously came to China for sightseeing once. After returning to China, he actively encouraged domestic universities to add a Chinese literature department. This shows that China gave him a profound influence, and he has great hopes for our China.

He has a torso of five feet and ten inches in height, and is very handsome. He likes sports and swimming, and loves writing and landscapes. When he was a child, he also liked to eat meat, but due to Gandhi's advice, he has been a vegetarian since 1920. Tobacco is always in hand, and he may drink a little alcohol when he goes abroad.

He usually wears a white Gandhi hat, and under the white hat, gray hair is revealed, which shows how hard he has worked for India. His face is quite white, unlike the Indians we usually see in Shanghai. He wears a white Indian-style waist coat, with a vest on the outside, just like other Indian Gandhi followers. He wears straw sandals on his feet. With this dress, you would never think that he is a person of noble birth.
