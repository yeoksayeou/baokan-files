### The First Batch of National Army Troops Airlifted Arrived in Changchun from Beiping

[United Press, Chongqing, 5th] Military sources say: Chairman Chiang presented cash as a New Year's gift to officers and soldiers of the 13th and 52nd Armies currently stationed in the Northeast, and the 92nd and 94th Armies currently stationed in Peiping and Tianjin. It is said that each officer received 2,000 yuan, and each soldier received 1,000 yuan.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 5th (Urgent Telegram)] Our first batch of airlifted troops arrived in Changchun from Peiping this afternoon. This marks the beginning of the large-scale airlift of the National Army to the Northeast in history. Subsequent troops will arrive by air in succession.

[United Press, Peiping, 5th] Authoritative sources have learned: The airlift of the National Army to the Northeast began this morning. The 2nd Brigade of the Security Army under General Du Yuming took transport planes from Peiping to Changchun. The 94th Army under General Mou Tingfang is expected to depart from the Tianjin area within a day or two.

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 4th] After Director Du received a telegram from Soviet military officers, he decided to dispatch a construction team to be stationed in Shenyang and appointed Deputy Commander Peng Bisheng as the director of the construction team. Peng, along with staff, secretaries, and 41 attendants, departed from Jinzhou by car on the morning of the 4th to Shenyang.

[Another Telegram] Director Du Yuming took a special train this morning along Yixian and Qinghemen to inspect Fuxin County.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 4th] Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Security Command, General Liang Huasheng, led personnel from the Cadre Training Corps and arrived in Hankou on the 2nd, passing through Hunan from Kunming.

[United Press, Peiping, 5th] The situation in the Northeast has become complicated again today. Although some provincial and municipal receiving officials continue to leave Peiping to take office in the Northeast, the movement of the main force of the troops is still obstructed. Only one column has moved from Yixian to Fuxian. The feeling here is that the next level of Sino-Soviet negotiations cannot be decided until Special Envoy Jiang Jingguo returns from Moscow to report on his mission.

### General Wedemeyer States at Press Conference That He Will Assist Us in Transporting Troops to the Northeast; New 6th Army Will Be Transported to Shenyang by Water in a Week

[This Newspaper] General Wedemeyer, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in the China Theater, held a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists at the Construction Building yesterday morning at 11:00 AM.

Regarding the transport of Chinese troops to the Northeast, General Wedemeyer said that so far, Chinese troops have not arrived in Shenyang and Harbin to take over. The Du Yuming army has now reached 25 miles outside the suburbs of Shenyang. Wedemeyer also stated that he has the authority to transport Chinese troops to the Northeast. The New 6th Army is currently making preparations such as cold-proofing and vaccinations, and will be transported by water from Shanghai to Shenyang in a week. The total number of people is 26,000. If the weather is not affected, it is planned to land at Huludao. Otherwise, they will land at Qinhuangdao. As for the two tasks of transporting Chinese troops to the Northeast and repatriating Japanese to their country, General Wedemeyer is preparing to combine the two parts of the work into one.

Also, 5,000 U.S. Marine Corps personnel will come to China from Guam to take over defense in the Northeast, so that personnel at high-altitude points can return home. Army personnel will also continue to come here. It is reported that the result of U.S. military recruitment in China is that many personnel are willing to stay in China to work and are very interested in China.

The method for the U.S. military to sell military supplies to China after the war is still being discussed by the two governments. General Wedemeyer said that he cannot express any opinions at this time. Military supplies listed as surplus materials are announced by him, but all subsequent implementation rights belong to the U.S. Military Surplus Materials Committee. The U.S. government may hand over six Liberty ships to the Chinese government, and the full power of their use belongs to the Chinese government. However, the most urgent need at present is the coal transportation problem. If the factories in this city resume work, a large amount of coal is urgently needed, and Qingdao also needs about 15,000 tons of coal per month.

Regarding the handling of the Jiangwan Airport by the U.S. Air Force and the Chinese government, according to General Wedemeyer: The British Air Force has completed the control of the use of the Jiangwan Airport, and the Chinese Aviation Commission is responsible for maintaining the airport's construction and other matters.

The personnel currently wearing U.S. military uniforms with the Chinese character "ä¸­" on their arms belong to the China National Aviation Corporation.

A reporter asked General Wedemeyer what he thought of the articles published in the "Stars and Stripes" that attacked the work of the U.S. military headquarters. General Wedemeyer replied: I like such articles. This is a great opportunity for them to freely express their opinions. I also welcome criticisms from all parties, as long as they are constructive. At the same time, I have also received a lot of private letters from U.S. soldiers and officers, praising and thanking me for my work, but I am unwilling to publish them, because articles of attack often attract attention. Regarding the tragic case of the U.S. military truck accident on Xiafei Road last time, General Wedemeyer has not yet received other reports. General Wedemeyer admitted that this was a U.S. military truck, but there are still 440 similar vehicles in this city used by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Chinese military.

General Chennault has not yet informed General Wedemeyer when he will come to China. If General Chen comes here in an official capacity, he will definitely receive notification from the U.S. government and Chairman Chiang.

Colonel Whitehouse, Marshal Marshall's economic and financial advisor, has not yet determined the date of his arrival in China and is currently receiving instructions in Washington.

Reports that General Wedemeyer will go to Chongqing to participate in the Chinese political conference are inaccurate. General Wedemeyer will soon travel to North China, but because U.S. Secretary of the Army Patterson will be here soon, he must wait to meet with him.

[United Press, Peiping, 5th] A spokesman for the Hebei Provincial Government yesterday presented a lengthy record of atrocities committed by the Communist army in North China to news reporters here.

They are being sorted out day and night, and the preliminary work has been completed. The nature of the petitions is roughly the same as those received in Peiping. The most common requests are for pensions, relief, and job assignments, totaling 279 items. Those requesting pensions and relief are mostly family members of soldiers and civilians who were killed or injured in the War of Resistance against Japan and people who suffered from the atrocities of the enemy puppets, whose family property was destroyed, and who were poor and helpless. Those requesting job assignments are mostly soldiers and civil servants who participated in the War of Resistance against Japan. There are also those who have been detained for cases and request investigation and release, and those whose relatives and friends participated in the War of Resistance against Japan and disappeared and request investigation and search. The next most common are petitions reporting the crimes of the enemy puppets, totaling 231 items, of which 67 items are reports of the atrocities of the Japanese invaders in the Nanjing Massacre. The various cruel acts of enemy soldiers, such as rape, murder, and looting, are shocking. One can imagine the ferocious faces of the beast soldiers and the tragic cries of the people in those years. Most of the petitioners have experienced it personally, and there is a lot of very true and very valuable information, such as the records of the Jinling Women's College Refugee Camp on that day, which is worth paying attention to. In addition, there are 150 cases of accusing civil servants, military police, and receiving personnel of illegal acts and dereliction of duty. Some are suffering and appealing, and some are speaking out of justice and reporting. There are 138 cases of various civil disputes, mostly disputes over the sale and lease of property, requesting fair handling. There are 53 items providing suggestions on military, political, and economic construction, and many are worthy of reference. There are 20 petitions reporting the atrocities of the Communist Party, the most prominent of which are reports of the "New Fourth Army" looting materials in Jiangsu and Anhui, levying exorbitant taxes, killing young people, and destroying transportation. There are 120 other statements that do not belong to the above categories, mostly expressing sincere respect and gratitude for Chairman Chiang's leadership in the War of Resistance against Japan, defeating the violent enemy, and restoring peace, or reporting on years of work and service aspirations, and requesting a meeting to report secret matters. There are also 73 petitions without names and addresses. All petitions will be effectively processed in accordance with Chairman Chiang's instructions. Except for those without names and addresses, replies to the petitioners have begun to be sent. As for the petition letters in Peiping, in addition to those that need to be investigated in detail, they have been actively processed separately. It is reported that the replies to the petitioners have been mailed in batches by air since the 31st of last month, and 1,612 letters have been sent so far.

### Beining Railway Open and Unimpeded - Jinpu Line to be Quickly Repaired and Ready to Reach Dezhou

[United Press, Peiping, 5th] Chinese newspapers report that the railway between Peiping and Shanhaiguan is now open and unimpeded.

### Snippets from Guangzhou

â Liang Feng

[Our Guangzhou Air Mail] I heard that Nanjing, Kunming, Hankou, and other places have already experienced showers, but Guangzhou is just like spring. Except for mornings and evenings when you need to wear an overcoat, a lined robe is enough at noon! People returning from Chongqing, Guiyang, and other places all feel that the weather in the South is really lovely.

It's the same Christmas, but the situation in Guangzhou and Hong Kong is very different. According to Hong Kong newspapers, "all cinemas and dance halls have tripled their profits, and major restaurants are packed with customers. The scene of elegantly dressed men and women rubbing shoulders is rare since the war..." As for here, apart from a group of God's children singing hymns in churches and a few prominent families holding private dances, there is not a single festive Christmas scene on the streets. It is likely that not many of our compatriots here are acquainted with Santa Claus!

The saying "Eating in Guangzhou" seems to have two interpretations: one is that Guangzhou is known for its many and exquisite types of food. The other interpretation is that Guangzhou people love to eat, which is not without reason. Recently, the Thrift Committee conducted a reliable survey and found that the total daily consumption of food and drink in tea houses and restaurants by members of society is more than 50 million yuan, or 150 billion yuan per month. 40% of this is attributed to the consumption of passing common people, and 60% is attributed to the unnecessary consumption of Guangzhou citizens. In this way, the unnecessary consumption of citizens on food and drink is more than 90 billion yuan per month, a truly staggering figure! No wonder the authorities are advocating thrift!

Social phenomena often have contradictions. On the one hand, there are such huge figures of consumption on food and drink, while on the other hand, there is no lack of people in need of relief. According to the local emergency relief society, from December 1st to December 26th, the society buried a total of 519 corpses, averaging more than 20 burials per day. It is said that the causes of death are mostly due to hardship and suffering during the war, malnutrition, and high prices after the victory, lack of relief, and no relatives after death, or relatives unable to afford funeral expenses. From this, we can also see the seriousness of the livelihood issues in Guangzhou.

The news that Central Goodwill Envoys Chen Jitang and Li Wenfan came to Guangdong has brought joy to the people of Baiyue. Like a group of suffering children who have just regained stability, they are excited to be comforted by a parent. However, it has caused trouble for the welcoming staff and reporters. On the morning of the 25th, it was said that the two special envoys would arrive at 11 o'clock, and everyone ran to the pier and waited until 2 o'clock without seeing anyone. At 8 o'clock in the afternoon, a message was received saying that they would arrive immediately, but it was still a false alarm. It turned out that the two special envoys had indeed arrived at the Provincial River that night, but due to martial law, they did not enter the city until early the next morning.

Since the beginning of winter, the theater scene here seems to be gradually booming. Following the performance of "Zhu Men Yuan" by the Political Corps of the Second Front Army, the Guangdong Drama Association's "Sorrowful City" and the Art Union's "La Traviata" are now being performed simultaneously.

A few days ago, a group of cultural figures came from Kunming, a border city: Zhang Min, Qu Baiyin, Zhou Gangming, Tian Nianyang, Han Beiping, Hou Minggao, Wang Yi, Xu Bingfeng, Hong Nai, and others. The comrades here extended their sincere and warm hands to welcome this group of cultural fighters, and a grand welcome party was held on a day of mild weather. At the meeting, everyone shouted a common slogan: "Build the nation on one hand, and build drama on the other!" (December 29th)

### After MacArthur Issued New Directive, Japanese Cabinet Falls into a Dilemma - Currently Compiling List of Dismissed Personnel - Number of Japanese Officials Involved May Reach 20,000

[Report from this newspaper] According to a radio broadcast from San Francisco at midnight on the 5th, after MacArthur ordered that former Japanese officials should not participate in current government work, two major figures will resign. One is Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Matsumura, and the other is Minister of Commerce and Industry Ogasawara. Both were members of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th] While the Japanese people were this morning focusing on the major Japanese political figures included in MacArthur's directive yesterday, all Japanese politicians were waiting with trepidation for the full impact of the order. According to unofficial estimates, the number of Japanese officials involved in the directive may reach 20,000. MacArthur's directive has almost led to the destruction of the Japanese political world, so the Japanese elections may be delayed for two months.

[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] MacArthur yesterday ordered the Japanese government to purge pro-aggression elements and begin compiling a list of officials to be dismissed. The Japanese political world was greatly shaken, and newspapers used large headlines to call it "Crisis in the Japanese Cabinet." Since the publication of the first list of war criminals, the repercussions caused by MacArthur's directive this time are the most widespread. The Japanese cabinet held an emergency meeting to discuss how to deal with the situation, appearing utterly at a loss. "Mainichi Shimbun" said that the cabinet has encountered the most serious crisis since taking office. Newspapers plan to list one by one those affected by this directive and those related to the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. Those listed include Privy Council President Suzuki, who served as president of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association during his term as prime minister, as well as six members of the House of Peers, Minister of Home Affairs Ishiwata, one member of the Privy Council, and three members of the House of Representatives. Foreign Minister Yoshida reportedly plans to immediately go to the GHQ to obtain a detailed report supplementing this directive and will submit it to the cabinet meeting this afternoon. The Japanese government has quickly begun compiling a list of dismissed personnel, which will be submitted to the GHQ before publication. According to Mainichi Shimbun, if this directive is strictly implemented, the only cabinet members not affected are Prime Minister Shidehara and Foreign Minister Yoshida. Prime Minister Shidehara has indicated that he intends to dismiss the cabinet members criticized by MacArthur and select talented individuals to cope with the situation. If so, whether the cabinet can be reorganized to overcome the difficulties will be a major issue. If the situation deteriorates, the cabinet may resign en masse. Yomiuri Shimbun said that Prime Minister Suzuki and his successor Prime Minister Higashikuni, who were in office when Japan surrendered, both participated in the Japanese Supreme Military Council and will inevitably be affected by this directive. Asahi Shimbun said that although this directive was expected, it is nothing less than a bucket of cold water poured on the Progressive Party. The Progressive Party is one of the most powerful political parties in Japan. Of its fifteen executives, only three can stay. An editorial in the newspaper on the previous day said that the United Nations policy has so far only sought to exclude those who led Japan astray, and now it has moved further towards building a new Japan. Although the people do not know what kind of leaders to elect, now that the evil ones are gone, they should strive to put forward suitable candidates to succeed them. The headquarters of the Socialist Party said that this directive will result in the destruction of the Progressive Party and the disintegration of the Liberal Party. The Socialist Party will benefit. Although some members of the party have joined the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, as a whole, it will be a major victory for the Socialist Party. This is an excellent opportunity to use to become a major party in the parliament.

Emergency Cabinet Meeting Postponed Until Today

[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] The emergency meeting of the Shidehara Cabinet, which was originally scheduled to be held today to discuss MacArthur's directive to purge militaristic elements from the Japanese political world, has now been postponed until tomorrow. According to Cabinet Secretary General Tsuda, the cabinet may remain in office after reorganization. Tsuda himself may not be able to retain his position. It is said that the postponement of the meeting is because the emergency ordinance drafting the conditions for the implementation of the directive was not completed today. The cabinet will now hold a meeting at 10 am tomorrow. Shidehara has not recovered from his cold and is still resting at home and may not be able to attend tomorrow's meeting. As for the reason for convening the cabinet meeting, the main topic is to discuss the imperial edict. Cabinet members will not make any formal decisions regarding the current government's attitude. However, the urgent questions of whether the cabinet will resign en masse, or whether all unqualified personnel will be dismissed before the remaining members continue to stay in office, will be thoroughly discussed. Foreign Minister Yoshida may not discuss MacArthur's directive from yesterday when reporting on national affairs this afternoon, nor will Yoshida go to the GHQ to discuss the implementation of the directive. According to the impression gained by Japanese newspaper reporters who have visited the prime minister's residence, Shidehara intends to continue to stay in office after dismissing three or five cabinet members. The number of cabinet members to be replaced will depend on how MacArthur's two recent directives are interpreted.

The Remnants of the Warlords Must Be Completely Cleared Away

[Special dispatch from this newspaper in Tokyo on the 5th] MacArthur yesterday ordered the Japanese government to remove all levels of personnel and organizations that brewed, launched, and led Japan to undermine world peace, with the aim of freeing all political parties and the government itself from the forces of warlords and brutality, and liberating government officials from the attacks and terror of secret terrorist societies. MacArthur instructed the Japanese government to abolish all extremist nationalist, terrorist, and warlord associations and groups, and other political associations and organizations must also be managed to prevent unlawful elements from controlling them. Government personnel who deceived and drove the Japanese people into the idea of conquering the world must be eliminated and not allowed to be employed as civil servants. According to this instruction, the Japanese government must replace and restrict all responsible persons who misled Japan.

Those excluded from executive positions include the following levels of people: (1) war criminals, (2) personnel of various military institutions, (3) all officers who have served in the military and naval police force, or other special or secret intelligence organizations, (4) managers and other key officials who have provided substantial economic and financial support to extremist nationalist, terrorist, and secret patriotic associations, or editors of publications of the same nature, or publishing institutions, members of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, Political Rule Assistance Association, and other socially influential members, (5) chairmen, vice-chairmen, advisors, general accountants, and branch managers of banks, development, and industrial promotion companies established in various Japanese-occupied areas as a result of the war, (6) certain senior officials, such as governors-general, civil affairs chiefs, military chiefs, and their equivalent ranks in Korea, Taiwan, Guangdong, the South Seas, East Indies, Vietnam, Burma, and continents, all Japanese officials in Mongolia, the Philippines, India, Thailand who ruled the local cooperative puppet government, (7) and all other militarists and those who commit violence against those who oppose the militarist system.

### Japanese Archives - Preventing Destruction - List of Traitors Should Be Especially Noted

[This newspaper, Tokyo, 5th] MacArthur's headquarters ordered the Japanese government to return all records, files, and official documents from various departments to their original locations, because these documents may be destroyed. During the Sino-Japanese War and before, there were many traitors who were involved in secret agent organizations and active throughout China. We hope that our government authorities will consult with MacArthur's headquarters and instruct the Japanese government to provide a list of undiscovered traitors from these documents in order to cleanse the bloodline of our nation.

### MacArthur Rejects Japanese Fishing in Our Territorial Waters

[This newspaper, Tokyo, 5th] The Japanese business shipping community, through the Central Liaison Office, submitted a request to the naval shipping management authorities of MacArthur's headquarters, requesting that the currently approved three Japanese offshore fishing zones be expanded to the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea. It is reported that this request has been rejected by MacArthur's headquarters.

[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] Yomiuri Shimbun reported that from December 31st of last year to January 1st of this year, only 8,000 Japanese people visited the Ise Grand Shrine, compared with an average of 400,000 people in previous years. This is probably the result of MacArthur's recent instruction to the Japanese government to abolish Shintoism and various shrines.

### U.S. Secretary of the Army to Leave Japan for Chongqing Within Days - To Meet with Chairman Chiang

[Report from this newspaper] According to a radio broadcast from San Francisco at midnight on the 5th, U.S. Secretary of the Army Patterson has arrived in Tokyo and will fly to Chongqing within a few days to meet with Chairman Chiang and General Wedemeyer.

[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] This morning, U.S. Secretary of the Army Patterson received a briefing in a meeting room near MacArthur's office from the heads of various departments of the Allied Supreme Commander regarding the progress of the occupation work. Officials at Supreme Headquarters said that Patterson was "very familiar" with the situation in all aspects.

### France Attaches Conditions to Participation in the Far Eastern Commission - Demands Veto Power

[Reuters, Paris, 5th] Semi-official sources here claim that if the Far Eastern Commission, as agreed at the Moscow Conference, allows France to have veto power, like China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, over all issues related to its interests, France will be willing to participate. The French government will inform the U.S. Ambassador to France of this intention today.

Regarding the Reply to the Peace Conference

[United Press, Paris, 4th] The Twenty-One Nation European Peace Conference is scheduled to convene in Paris on May 1st. France has today notified the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union to grant the smaller countries greater speaking rights, not only expressing hope for the Balkan and Finnish treaties. Some diplomats consider it a disturbing problem that will slow down the work of the peace conference.

### U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee - To Hold Special Meeting

Listening to the Report of Secretary Byrnes

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 4th] U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee member George said yesterday that he expects to invite Secretary of State Byrnes to attend a special meeting of the Foreign Relations Committee shortly after Congress reconvenes. George stated that he believes that members of the committee would like to hear a direct report from the Secretary of State regarding the Moscow Conference.

### UN General Assembly First Session - Only Five Days Until Opening - Delegates from Various Countries Depart for London - Proposals to the Assembly Have Been Cutoff As of Yesterday

[Central News Agency, London, 4th] The final preparations for the first session of the United Nations General Assembly, which is being held in Westminster Abbey, have been completed, and a new world organization to maintain world security and peace will be officially launched here. The opening ceremony of the General Assembly is scheduled for 4:00 pm on January 14th, to allow radio commentators to broadcast the opening to all corners of the world. According to the UN Secretariat, approximately 400 million journalists and radio commentators representing the United Nations have received press passes. The chairman of the UN Preparatory Commission, Columbia representative Dr. Ambe, will serve as the temporary chairman of the opening ceremony. British Prime Minister Attlee will deliver a welcoming speech on behalf of the host country. The opening ceremony is said to be very simple. In addition to the opening and welcoming speeches, the first day of the General Assembly will only be devoted to electing the President of the General Assembly. Some delegations have already arrived in London, and others are en route to the UK and will arrive within days. It is believed that this General Assembly is the largest gathering of politicians in world history. According to current information, two delegations will be led by the heads of government of their respective countries, namely the United Kingdom and New Zealand. In addition, the delegations of the United States, France, Denmark, the Netherlands, Turkey, Egypt, Greece, and Norway will be led by their foreign ministers. It has now been confirmed that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will not be able to attend the General Assembly and will be replaced by Deputy Chairman Vyshinsky to lead the delegation. The Canadian delegation will be led by its Minister of Justice, Laurent.

[Reuters, London, 5th] The plenary session of the United Nations, with a total of fifty-one countries participating, is scheduled to hold its first meeting here on January 10 (next Thursday). Representatives from South American countries will travel here by American Airlines and American Overseas Airlines. One hundred U.S. representatives, fifty-five representatives from South American countries, and delegations from Canada and Australia, as well as some Soviet representatives and the French Ambassador to the United States, have boarded the Queen Mary and are expected to arrive in Southampton this weekend. The British government will send a representative, perhaps Minister of State Packer, to welcome them. Representatives from China, Egypt, Iran, and India will travel to the UK on British Airways planes. The Soviet delegation has brought seven large planes to fly directly from Moscow to the conference. Motions to be submitted to the first meeting of the General Assembly must be submitted before today. It is understood that the British cabinet discussed the final form of the motion that the British government intends to submit to the General Assembly. As of yesterday, the governments of China, France, and Canada had not yet responded to the nuclear energy control plan agreed upon at the Moscow Conference. It is expected that this will be one of the most exciting debates when the General Assembly meets.

Important Agenda

Another important task of the General Assembly is the election of the President of the United Nations. Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak seems well suited for this position. As for the election of the Secretary-General, since the headquarters is located in the United States, it is generally hoped that a European will be appointed to balance the situation. Other important items on the agenda include the election of six non-permanent members of the Security Council. Canada, as the holder of atomic secrets, is expected to be elected as one of the members. In addition, the world's refugee problem has also been included on the agenda. The first meeting of the General Assembly is expected to last for a month. Before it concludes, it is hoped that some neutral countries will join the United Nations.

Locating the Headquarters

[Report from this newspaper] According to a radio broadcast from San Francisco at midnight on the 5th, a committee composed of six countriesâChina, the United Kingdom, France, Uruguay, Yugoslavia, and Iraqâarrived in New York today to survey the permanent headquarters of the United Nations in the eastern United States. Dr. Hu Shih from China is also participating in the work. A report is expected to be completed before February 1st and submitted to the General Assembly for a decision.

### British Empire Troops Occupy Japan - All Military Operations Controlled by the US, Policy Matters Handled by the General Staff

[Reuters, London, 5th] New Delhi Radio announced today that the British Commonwealth's occupation forces in Japan will be dispatched by the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and India, under the command of Lieutenant General Northcott. This occupation force will be under US control for all military operational matters. As for policy matters and affairs concerning the army, the commander-in-chief, together with other relevant officers, will be responsible to the Joint General Staff in Australia. This staff will be composed of the Australian Chief of Staff, a representative from the United Kingdom, the Indian Commander-in-Chief, Sir Claude Auchinleck, and the New Zealand Chief of Staff. New Delhi Radio further stated that the administration of the occupation forces in Japan is a further development of closer unity within the British Commonwealth, ensuring that each relevant nation within the Commonwealth has full authority over this joint mission. London officials declined to comment on the announcement from New Delhi regarding the participation of British and Indian troops in the occupation of Japan. Informed sources told reporters that the British government intends to wait before making any announcements.

### British Delegation Arrives in India

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 5th Dispatch] The British Parliamentary delegation is en route to Delhi, having arrived in Karachi and will fly here tonight.

### Vigorous Competition Among Parties in Vietnamese General Election

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 4th Dispatch] The all-Vietnam general election, presided over by the Vietnamese Provisional Government, will be held on the first Sunday of the new year (i.e., the 6th). Since the establishment of the Vietnamese Provisional Coalition Government, the attitudes of various Vietnamese parties towards the general election have changed from what they were before. Only the Vietnam Independence League is actively campaigning, but other parties have also quickly caught up and launched their campaign activities. According to Vietnamese government officials who spoke to reporters, 900,000 Vietnamese voters will participate in the election. Government agencies, schools, factories, and shops will be closed for one day to allow voters time to participate in the voting. The Vietnamese government has issued a notice advising foreigners residing in Vietnam to prepare food in advance to avoid temporary problems. The National Assembly produced by this general election in Vietnam will determine Vietnam's constitution and political system. According to the impressions gained by reporters in contact with several qualified Vietnamese individuals, most Vietnamese people hope that Annam King Báº£o Äáº¡i can serve as president, as his views are considered more moderate than those of Ho Chi Minh.

### Vietnamese Troops Resist French Forces - Scorched Earth Tactics Employed - Large Fires in the Suburbs of Saigon

[United Press, Saigon, 4th Dispatch] As French troops advance, Annamese forces are employing a scorched earth policy. A large fire broke out tonight in the western suburbs of Saigon. In the northeast corner, black smoke billowed like an angry tide, covering the sky and earth. French forces encountered fierce resistance and were unable to reach any of the fire locations. It is reported that a government warehouse storing 20,000 tons of rubber has been consumed by the fire. In the area 60 miles north of Saigon, where French forces have penetrated deepest, villages and rubber plantations have also been destroyed.

### Global Uranium Reserves Sufficient for 200 Years of Use

[Central News Agency, London, 4th Dispatch] Professor Massey of the University of London stated in a speech today that global uranium reserves are sufficient to support the development of atomic energy for 200 years. Massey, one of the British scientists who researched atomic energy during the war, added that it may still take ten years to apply atomic energy to peacetime industry. The importance of this application is comparable to that of the atomic bomb, and its scope is beyond what can be foreseen at present.

### "Butcher of Fort Santiago" Ota Sentenced to Hang - Honma's Face Changed Upon Hearing the News

[United Press, Manila, 5th Dispatch] Ota, the commander of the Japanese military police in Manila during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, was convicted as a war criminal and sentenced to hang today. Ota, known as the "Butcher of Fort Santiago," tortured and beat prisoners during interrogations, resulting in numerous deaths. According to the military court that tried the case, Ota was fully aware of the actions of his subordinates and the nature of the Japanese army. He was guilty of not just one crime, but a series of crimes. Although he claimed to have been acting under orders, this cannot absolve him of guilt. The date of Ota's execution has not yet been determined, as it likely awaits the US Supreme Court's decision on Yamashita Tomoyuki's appeal, as the legal issues in the two cases are similar. Lieutenant General Honma, on trial in another court, turned pale upon hearing of Ota's death sentence. Honma's crimes of mistreating prisoners are no less than Ota's, and the evidence is conclusive, making it unlikely that he will escape punishment, so it is no wonder he was so disturbed by the news.

### US Grants Huge Loan to China for Purchase of American Cotton - Totaling $33 Million

[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th Dispatch] According to authoritative sources, the Export-Import Bank of the United States has loaned $20 to $30 million to China for the purchase of American cotton. The Export-Import Bank was originally scheduled to announce the details of the loan today but decided to postpone the announcement until next week. The reason for the delay is unclear.

[United Press, Washington, 4th Dispatch] A plan to supply China with 275,000 to 300,000 bales of American cotton is nearing completion. It is expected that the Export-Import Bank will soon announce a $33 million credit to finance China's purchase of cotton. Informed sources say that this cotton purchase agreement is similar in nature to the cotton loans already granted to European countries.

### Successful American Experiment with Machine Cotton Planting

[United Press, Atlanta, 4th Dispatch] In this age of mechanization, machine cotton planting is now no longer just empty talk. Recently, in every state in the American cotton-growing belt, a cotton-picking machine has been tested, and the amount it picks in one hour would take a skilled worker a week of sixty hours to pick by hand. There are not many of these machines yet, and mass production is not yet possible, but cotton farmers everywhere are saying that mechanization is an inevitable trend.

Saving Labor

In North Carolina, a cotton company recently bought a cotton-picking machine and will rent it out to farmers during the harvest season for $1.25 per hundred pounds, whereas farmers currently pay $2.25 to $3 per hundred pounds for manual cotton picking. Not only can cotton picking be done by machine, but there are also weeders and trash burners, which are used to remove weeds. This work has always been done entirely by hand, with workers bending over, which is very strenuous. These types of machines have already been used on some cotton fields with considerable success, and their efficiency will undoubtedly increase. According to Agriculture Minister Anderson, as a result of agricultural mechanization, in five or ten years, perhaps only three million farmers will be enough. Therefore, in the southern United States, farmers must find work outside of farms. All authoritative opinions say that southern farmland will become larger and larger, the number will decrease, and the number of farmers and workers will also decrease, but the average income per person will increase greatly. Anderson also said, "The increase in agricultural output and the increase in variety will definitely require the manufacture and sale of more agricultural tools and machinery, more intermediate industries, more transportation, and more service industries."

Research and Improvement

However, the expansion of southern industry will not crowd out the markets of other places, because the food produced in the south is actually what the south itself needs. Anderson's words clearly point out that there is a close relationship between industry, agriculture, and commerce in this agricultural region, which is consistent with the opinions of other economic experts. In recent years, the southern cotton fields have been greatly reduced, but the yield has increased to 100 pounds per acre in the past ten years, and now they want to increase it further. The American Cotton Industry Extension Service is leading an improvement campaign, which has repeatedly convened meetings of researchers in the cotton-growing belt to develop procedures: first, urging farmers not to plant cotton arbitrarily, but to select the most suitable land and consider the land needed for other agricultural products; and also promoting the use of crop rotation and various labor-saving methods, selecting the best local seeds, using the most appropriate pest control methods, and collecting and ginning cotton to ensure the highest quality, so that high-quality goods can be sold in large quantities. In addition, cotton is also facing many new rivals, such as rayon, nylon, glass fiber, and paper. The production of rayon fiber in the United States is approximately equal to 1.7 million bales of cotton, and its price is cheaper than any high-quality yarn.

Wide Use

According to researchers' reports, another type of artificial fabric is also about to be successful. This fabric does not need to be spun and is made in one whole piece. On the one hand, cotton research is also being carried out to compete with artificial fabrics. The American Cotton Committee recently established a cotton research institute with a fund of $2 million, and there are reports of new uses for cotton almost every week. It is impossible to list all the uses of cotton at present, but it is estimated that during this war, there were as many as 11,000 types of cotton products used for military purposes alone. The latest invention is that when building low-value farmhouses, the exterior can be wrapped in a type of cotton cloth, and it can be used as an insulator indoors. In addition, a fire-resistant and non-corrosive cotton has also been successfully developed. The cotton industry has gone through many crises. In 1920, the price of cotton fell from 45 cents per pound to 12 cents, and it also suffered from a boll weevil infestation. During the most depressed period, the price of cotton fell to as low as 6 cents per pound.

Not Afraid of Strong Enemies

Cotton Committee Chairman Johnston said: The production price of cotton must be reduced, but there is no real threat to the cotton industry at present and in the future. Artificial material research has made significant achievements, but there is still nothing that can replace cotton in various uses and be completely satisfactory. It seems that relying on the power of science, one cannot find such an all-powerful thing that can compete with cotton. Recently, there has been a lot of talk about ramie, saying that it is the strongest fiber plant. In some areas of the United States, there are hundreds of acres of land planted with ramie. Some economists believe that this is no harm to the cotton industry, because although the death knell of the cotton industry has been tolled several times, cotton is still standing tall, so how can it be helped.

### Emperor William II's Crown Found - Authenticity Awaits Investigation

[Reuters, London, 5th Dispatch] The German Control Commission announced that the crown of former Emperor William II and the snuffbox of former Prussian Frederick the Great have been discovered by British officials in a church near Minden, Germany, apparently hidden there by members of the Hohenzollern family during the war. After the concealment of these objects gave rise to some rumors, the authorities obtained the location of the hiding place from Oscar, the son of . Therefore, he was also present when they were discovered. Two boxes were found inside the church's staircase, one containing the crown and the other containing the snuffbox. According to Oscar, the crown belongs to the King of Prussia. After the Hohenzollern family became emperors, it was preserved by the family, and no other imperial crown was made thereafter. Whether this statement is true and whether the crown is a fake remains to be investigated. The snuffbox is a fine piece from the 18th century, made with enamel and gold, and is famous for its exquisite craftsmanship.

### British Government Actively Promotes - Strengthening Colonial Policy - Plan to Organize the Malayan Federation Not Yet Released - Caribbean Conference Invites Dutch and French Participation

[Reuters, London, 5th Dispatch] In order to strengthen the British colonial system in preparation for establishing larger autonomous governments, former British High Commissioner to Palestine, Sir Alan Cunningham, will go to Malta to meet with leaders to discuss a new constitutional plan. The debate over the island's status has been going on for a long time. It was not until 1943 that the British government allowed the restoration of responsible government there after the war. Malta suffered heavy losses from repeated bombings during the war. Therefore, Cunningham will also report on Malta's need for financial assistance. Cunningham has just returned from Malaya, where he discussed the issue of merging the Straits Settlements and the nine Malayan states to form a federation. His report has not yet been published. Some say that this merger and the establishment of Malayan citizenship will be of great help to future economic development. Four colonies in West Africa - Sierra Leone, Gambia, Nigeria, and the Gold Coast - have established a common committee, the ultimate goal of which is also to merge into larger units to facilitate development. Although the plan to establish regional advisory councils in Kenya, Nyasaland, Tanganyika, and Uganda in Africa has been repeatedly proposed in the British Lower House, no resolution has yet been reached. Regarding the Western Hemisphere, the Anglo-American Caribbean Commission is scheduled to meet in Saint Thomas, in the Virgin Islands, on February 21, and Dutch and French representatives may also participate. The committee was jointly established by the British and American governments in 1942 to promote social and economic cooperation in the Caribbean region. It has since been expanded twice. The first time, unofficial representatives of the West Indies were allowed to attend, and this time, Dutch and French representatives are invited to participate again. The British Caribbean colonies have a total population of three million. The British goal is to establish a federation of the British West Indies, creating a fully autonomous government within the British Commonwealth.

### Extreme Heat in Southern Australia

[United Press, Sydney, 5th Dispatch] New South Wales was hit by a heatwave today, with three deaths from heatstroke and twenty-nine people collapsing from the heat in Sydney. The highest temperature recorded was 111 degrees Fahrenheit in Bourke and 102 degrees in Sydney.

### American Political Circles Mostly Dissatisfied with British Stance on Siam

[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th United Press Dispatch] British officials say that in view of Siam's declaration of war against Britain, the terms of the current British treaty with Siam are "generous." British officials admit that the demand for Siam to provide 1.5 million tons of rice as quickly as possible from its current large surplus may cause economic hardship in Siam. However, they claim that as a result of Siam's participation in the war, other countries in Southeast Asia have suffered even greater poverty and upheaval. It is understood that US officials are dissatisfied with Britain's position on this issue, for at least two reasons: First, the United States believes that the contribution of the Siamese underground workers to the common goals of the Allies is more than enough to compensate for the impact of Siam's reluctant participation in the Japanese war effort. Second, US officials believe that the British estimate of Siam's current surplus rice reserves of 1.5 million tons is twice the actual amount, and officials fear that this British demand will seriously damage Siam's economic situation.

### Iranian Parliamentarians Urge Prime Minister to Resign

[Reuters, Tehran, 5th Dispatch] Iranian left-wing and right-wing lecturers recently held private meetings, deciding to inform Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi that they expect him to resign on Sunday "to clarify the situation in the country." It is widely believed that former Iranian Prime Ministers Ahmad Qavam and Manouchehr Eghbal are most likely to succeed as Prime Minister.

### The Motive Behind Hess's Flight to England to Explore Peace

[United Press, Nuremberg, 4th Dispatch] According to secret Hitler documents recently discovered in the British-occupied zone of Germany, prominent figures in British circles wrote to Hess's representative, Haushofer, in May 1941 to explore peace, one month before Hess flew to England. Haushofer, as Hess's confidential advisor, informed Hitler in detail of his position in the peace negotiations after Hess flew to England, mentioning more than a dozen British dignitaries who he believed were in favor of a compromise with Germany.

### Arab Countries Demand Withdrawal of Foreign Troops

[Reuters, Cairo, 5th Dispatch] Arab League Secretary-General Azzam Pasha stated last night that the Arab League demands the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Arab lands, including French North Africa. We must make people around the world realize that we will never recognize so-called military strategic points occupied by any foreign country within Arab territories.

### Vaccine Extracted from Fertilized Chicken Eggs Can Prevent Influenza

[United Press, Ann Arbor, 4th Dispatch] The University of Michigan recently announced that a vaccine can be extracted from fertilized chicken eggs that is very effective in preventing influenza. This vaccine was invented by Dr. Thomas Francis Jr., head of the Department of Epidemiology at the University's School of Public Health, in collaboration with the Army Surgeon General's Office. Previously, the only way to deal with influenza was to take careful care of patients. This vaccine has been tested for two years and has proven its effectiveness. The ratio of army personnel who have been vaccinated to those who have not contracted influenza is one to four.

### Local Dispatches

Songjiang: Bandits Rob Police Weapons and Rice Store

Around 9:00 PM on New Year's Eve, about fifty bandits suddenly arrived in Zhangyan Town, south of Shanghai. They spoke in mixed dialects and were equipped with machine guns, rifles, and pistols. After entering the town, they first robbed four rifles from the police station, then stormed into the Hengji Rice Store, stealing more than forty stones of white rice, fired warning shots, and left swaggeringly.

Jiaxing: Please Set Up More Counterfeit Money Exchange Points

After the banks in Jiaxing started exchanging counterfeit money from November 1st of last year, stores continued to use counterfeit money as usual. Although the circulation in the market has gradually decreased, the amount is quite large and the exchange procedures are troublesome, so the general public is unwilling to exchange it. Currently, the Business Association has announced to all businesses that they will switch to legal tender from New Year's Day to promote the public's rapid exchange of counterfeit money. However, because banks are closed for the New Year holiday, those holding counterfeit money cannot exchange it, and stores refuse to accept it, causing disputes from time to time. After discussions among the merchants, they agreed to refuse to use 500-yuan counterfeit bills uniformly, and to use the remaining bills sparingly. At the same time, they requested the Business Association to ask the banks to set up more exchange points to benefit the public.

Fenghua: Temporary Telegraph Bureau in Xikou

(New Tide News Agency) In order to strengthen the communication equipment in this town, the Ministry of Communications dispatched more than ten technical operators and other personnel from the Hangzhou Telecommunications Bureau on the 17th of this month, bringing wireless telecommunications equipment to set up a temporary telecommunications bureau. They also carried a letter from Xu Yi, receiving committee member of the Zheng County Telecommunications Bureau, to the Xikou Town Office, requesting assistance. The town office has temporarily lent a portion of the Wuxing School building to serve as the bureau's office location to actively carry out the work.

Taixian: Repel the Bandit Attack on Taixian

For the past ten days, bandits have gathered more than a dozen regiments, cutting off the Yangtai Highway in an attempt to occupy Yangtai and then cross the river to threaten Nanjing and Shanghai. Starting from the 20th of last month, about 30,000 bandits in more than ten regiments besieged Taixian. The garrison at Guo Cai, the most important stronghold on the periphery, was defended by Regiment Commander Wang Jianzhai, who fought a bloody battle for eight days and nights, charging more than a hundred times, and finally repelled the superior bandits. Taixian turned from danger to safety. Currently, they are searching for the remaining bandits and restoring traffic on the Yangtai Highway.

### Top Nazi Spy Enjoys Comfort in Concentration Camp, While Anti-Nazi Comrades Struggle in Hunger and Cold

â Reported by the English-language *China Evening News* Â· Translated by this Newspaper's Translation Department

While the Nuremberg International Tribunal in Europe is conducting the grand trial of key Nazi criminals and their special agents, the "Gestapo," on this side of the world, in China, which occupies an important and vast strategic position, Hitler's cohorts are still enjoying a life of considerable freedom and comfort, and it seems they will not be punished for their past crimes. Mr. Newton, a correspondent for the Howard News Association in China, mentioned the above-mentioned ludicrous fact in the third of his communications on reporting the underground activities of Germans and Japanese in Shanghai after the victory.

In addition to the above-mentioned facts, thousands of Japanese remain freely active within Chinese territory. This is clearly the result of the US government's leniency toward German and Japanese activities in China. At the same time, the Chinese authorities are busy dealing with the disturbances of the Communist army, and the US military authorities have no power to arrest German and Japanese criminals (except those who have committed special crimes that directly harm Americans). All these facts have given the enemy elements of Germany and Japan a chance to breathe and enjoy themselves.

Key Nazi Criminals Arrested

Several weeks ago, the US military authorities urged the Chinese side to arrest 103 of the 319 well-known Nazi personnel stationed in Shanghai. As a result, only 50-odd criminals were apprehended, barely half of the list.

Among this group of arrested criminals, many, including the most active spies of Germany in the Far East in the past, may still find a "way out" and be freed from the concentration camp. Mrs. Aiva Tang, a Nazi radio host and correspondent for the Haitong News Agency in Shanghai, is also among those detained.

Prisoners Calling the Shots

Regarding the three major Nazi figures in the Far East, I intend to report to readers. The first, it is said, is currently "ill" and residing in the most upscale hospital in Shanghai. The second has been detained in a concentration camp, but he can still leave the camp to enjoy fine dining or sneak into a cafÃ© to do business. Only the third person is actually confined within the camp. According to the importance of each criminal, the three major criminals are: (1) Pudkakatzen, the "number one" Nazi in China, who is the director of German intelligence; (2) Lieutenant Colonel Ohard, an Eisenslag, also known as Eisenbrechsel, who is the director of Hitler's military and commercial espionage agency in China, the "Ohard Affairs Bureau"; (3) Lachelmann, nominally the head of the German Railway Bureau, but in reality one of the leaders of Nazi activities in China.

Acting Like the Old Bosses

Logically, detained Nazi criminals should no longer employ servants, except for a few "coolies." However, the situation here seems to be an exception. They still hire "old servants" and "chief stewards," so even when confined within the concentration camp, they still appear here as "old bosses."

On the other hand, we must describe a tragic situation. Many "stateless" exiles, men and women who had long been expelled from the country by Hitler, or who had fled here to escape the clutches of Nazi secret police, are unable to find a place to live in Shanghai, which is currently filled with Nazi elements and Japanese soldiers and civilians. They can only suffer and use dilapidated tents as their "mansions," confined to a corner of Hongkou. In this area, Nazi party members once swaggered and showed off during the war, riding in fancy cars, wearing full military uniforms, and forcing refugees to "thoroughly cooperate" with them. Then their military authorities would issue "passes," which perhaps was what they called "free entry and exit."

What a Miserable Contrast

The Nazis live in three-story Western-style houses, which used to be a middle school during the Japanese occupation. The brick walls are freshly painted, the floors are smooth, and the windows are clean.

However, what are the circumstances in which the anti-Nazi refugees live? They live in the Xide Road refugee camp, where the so-called "rooms" are as dark as caves, without seeing the light of day, because there are no windows. Living there is simply like living like livestock. The room occupied by two Nazi party members is much larger than the one occupied by ten anti-Nazi refugees.

The contrast in terms of food is also disheartening enough to make one feel lost. This world is so cruel and ruthless, how can one not find it hard to believe? But this is the true situation, and one must believe it!

The Nazi party members have wine and meat, and bags of bread are stacked so high that they reach the ceiling. But the anti-Nazi exiles only rely on occasional shipments of flour from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for assistance. Beyond that, there is no talk of any food.

Number One Espionage Activities

In order to cover up Ohard's espionage activities, Hitler had him appear in China as a businessman, and then had him organize the Ohard Affairs Bureau. He had a semi-diplomatic mission and focused on completing three major goals. The first goal was to investigate Soviet purchases, the second was to investigate the situation in Japan, and the third was to report on the war situation and material conditions in the Far East. During this period, he went to Japan several times and engaged in activities there.

Shanghai-Guangdong Intelligence Network

This fierce-looking Ohard established three Nazi strongholds in China: (1) Beijing, (2) Shanghai, (3) Guangzhou. All three locations were equipped with radio stations, which, in addition to communicating directly with Berlin, also provided important intelligence to the country's submarine authorities. All intelligence supplied by each station to the submarines was received and transmitted by Shanghai, and then relayed to Berlin.

Foreign Refugees in Shanghai

The total number of "foreign refugees" currently in Shanghai is 39 million. Among them, 15,000 are of German, Austrian, or Czech nationality, 14,000 are Jewish, 600 are Protestant, and 400 are Muslim. Many of them have been classified by the authorities as "stateless" people. They are quite understanding of the fact that the Chinese government is troubled by the Communist army incident and has no time to take care of relief matters, so they are even more eager for another source of assistance. That strength is the strength that the American people can bestow.

### Japanese Residents Launch Clandestine Talk-Based Underground Movement, Four Factions Vie for Leadership, Authorities Should Strengthen Re-Education Work

â By United Press Correspondent Yuan Lunren Â· Translated by this Newspaper's Translation Department

The re-education movement for Japanese in Shanghai, which began under the auspices of the Third Front Army, has been underway for nearly two months and is currently encountering serious underground resistance from the Japanese. The Japanese seem to have gradually become indifferent to the kindness of the Chinese authorities in treating them leniently at the beginning of their surrender. According to reports, a small number of Japanese people have been found in the Japanese concentration camp in the northern district of Shanghai who are adopting secret and strong resistance to the democratic ideas that the Chinese authorities have instilled in 90,000 Japanese people. This small group of Japanese people believe that their new position is entirely that of the conquered. Although their numbers are small, they have some influence.

Most Japanese people are not concerned about political disputes. One Japanese person said that they are busy seeking a livelihood. Many of them are worried about whether their money will be enough to support them until they are repatriated. Some are wondering whether they will be able to survive there after returning to their homeland.

Common Goal: Plotting Resistance to Re-Education

At the other extreme, there is also a small group of Japanese people who vehemently do not deny that they are communists. They openly advocate the abolition of the Emperor system and enthusiastically support General MacArthur's plan to control Japan. This group of Japanese people is really too small in number to influence the entire Japanese community. The Japanese in Shanghai have psychologically accepted the previous militarism and fascist doctrines. A well-informed source close to the authorities responsible for managing the Japanese concentration area divided the groups of Japanese underground resistance movements into four factions. These four factions are vying for leadership within the Japanese concentration area. On the surface, they pretend to obey the orders of the Chinese management authorities, but in fact they cannot thoroughly implement them. They have a common goal: to resist the Chinese re-education plan.

Different Factions: Each with Hidden Agendas

One of the factions is reportedly led by former Japanese diplomatic and consular personnel stationed in China. The leader of this "Foreign Ministry faction" is Tsuda, the former Japanese minister to the puppet Nanjing government.

Tsuda is currently still serving as the chairman of the Japanese Self-Government Association, which is appointed by the Chinese authorities. Qualified sources have compared him to one of the Japanese leaders before Japan's surrender and said that the Chinese authorities are considering relocating another person with a chiefdom-style personality to succeed him, but they have not yet found a figure who is as famous and prestigious as this old diplomat.

Although the Japanese army has been disarmed, it still maintains its influence in the Japanese national body. It will take a long time to change the psychology of the Japanese people who have been intimidated by the military for centuries. The leading figure of this "military faction" is Okamura Neiji, the former commander-in-chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China. He is now the director of the Nanjing Liaison Office. It is said that his representative in Shanghai is Matsui, whose troops used to be stationed in Shanghai.

The Japanese Navy, which has always been jealous of the Army, leads the third faction. It is said that the host is a certain lieutenant general. This third faction does not have as much influence as the Army faction, because the Army faction also has plainclothes personnel from the former military police, who still occupy a great deal of power.

The fourth faction is the successor to the former Japanese Residents Group. The leader is Nakajima, who once served as the Consul General in Shanghai. Before the Pearl Harbor Incident, the Japanese Residents Group was a useful and powerful political weapon for the Japanese in this city. It always controlled the Japanese delegation in the former Public Concession Works Bureau, but this group was not sufficient to represent all the Japanese residents in Shanghai. It only represents large merchants.

Stormtroopers: Formerly Military Police

Chinese well-informed sources told United Press that the Japanese underground resistance movement has so far been limited to verbal activities. They are launching clandestine talk-based resistance movements against Chinese officials responsible for re-education work, and they are also generally smearing Japanese people who are assisting the Chinese re-education plan.

Several incidents of violent attacks on Japanese personnel who assisted or stood on the side of Chinese re-education personnel have been discovered. Two or three assistant editors of the Japanese newspaper "Democratic Japan," which is run by the Third Front Army, have been attacked by thugs.

An extremist nationalist party has established a stormtrooper organization called the "Shanghai Stormtroopers," many of whom are former military police officers.

Only Seventy-Odd Democrats

On the other hand, a small number of Japanese people are very accepting of the Chinese re-education movement, especially those in the intellectual class. There are more than seventy Japanese people who are very active members of the "Cultural People's Club." The leader here is Hoshino, who is the only Japanese person in Shanghai who openly advocates the immediate abolition of the Emperor system. Hoshino's brother is also among the war criminals, and is currently imprisoned in Sugamo Prison. He was the secretary general of Tojo's cabinet and is one of the black singles of war criminals finally announced by MacArthur. The name of Prince Nishimoto, the brother of Emperor Meiji, also appears on this list of war criminals.

A member of the Cultural People's Club told United Press that unless the Emperor system is abolished, true democracy will never be realized in Japan. He admitted that they only represent a small part of the Japanese people. He pointed out that in a recent vote held at the Tokyo Higher Industrial School, only 27 out of 3,000 students voted in favor of abolishing the Emperor system, 58 voted in favor of preserving the old dynasty, and twenty students favored reducing the royal inheritance to a minimum.

Many Japanese Residents Support MacArthur's Policies

This member of the Cultural People's Club said that many Japanese people in this city agree with the plan implemented by MacArthur in Japan. They believe that if the Japanese government thoroughly implements the orders of the Supreme Commander in both letter and spirit, the democratization of Japan will definitely succeed. Therefore, Japanese people with democratic ideas oppose the current Japanese government because it does not faithfully implement MacArthur's instructions.

When asked for his personal opinion on the treatment of Japanese civilians and prisoners by the Chinese, he said, "I was here during the war, and I remember how the Japanese treated the Chinese. The antagonism between the two was really too sharp!"

Many Japanese people feel that they should prepare for a more difficult life after returning to their homeland during the waiting period for their return. Many of them still do not know if they will have a place to live after returning home. He believes that the Japanese should know more about world events and broaden their horizons. He explained that the trend of Japanese people learning English is part of the re-education plan, so that they can read English announcements themselves and have direct contact with the US occupation forces stationed in Japan.

The "Jiangjian" Ship Being Salvaged in Badong Taizi Bay

### Largest Merchant Ship Connecting Taiwan and the Mainland, "Taipei Hao" to Begin Sailing

â By This Newspaper's Special Correspondent Qian Pei

Today is the first New Year after Taiwan's recovery. In the morning, the sun rises early, the clear light shines, and the spring scenery is boundless. The reporter jumps up from the bed (actually not a bed, but a "tatami mat" laid on the floor), throwing off the fatigue, worries, disappointments, and sorrows of the past year. I feel an infinite hope and eager expectation for the future, and I also feel that new opportunities are emerging for a career, and the heart of loving the country arises spontaneously.

From a practical point of view, this place is really an isolated island in a remote corner, separated by vast oceans. However, on this day of the beginning of a new cycle and the renewal of all things, we are also celebrating deeply with our compatriots in the mainland, without distinction between inside and outside. Today's New Year's Day celebration program includes the National Ceremony at Zhongshan Hall (Public Hall) at 10:00 am, the naming ceremony of the giant ship Taipei Hao at Keelung Port at 2:00 pm, the parade of all Taipei citizens in the afternoon, and the grand performance of the symphony concert at the Public Hall in the evening. There are many eye-catching events, but these are just a few examples.

Giant Ship Taipei Hao Holds Naming Ceremony

The ship "Taipei Hao" was originally named "Daiya Maru" and was sunk in Keelung Port during the war. After Taiwan's recovery, the Chinese authorities ordered the Japanese Navy to take charge of the planning and salvage of sunken ships in Keelung and Kaohsiung ports, and the Taiwan Governor-General's Office's Transportation Department urged them to proceed. The salvage work of "Daiya Maru" was soon designed and carried out by the Keelung Port Bureau of the Transportation Department. The ship was salvaged in early November and entered the dock for repairs. The project was completed at the end of December. After leaving the dock, it was berthed at Keelung Port's No. 3 pier. The ship is 218 meters long, 18.2 meters wide, and 11.1 meters deep, with a total tonnage of approximately 7,000 tons. It has a turbine engine with 2,200 horsepower and a sailing speed of 10 nautical miles per hour. It is the largest ship among Chinese merchant ships. Today's naming ceremony was also held at the No. 3 pier of Keelung Port under the chairmanship of Administrative Governor Chen Yi, from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm. The US military also sent representatives to participate, which was quite a grand occasion. In the future, this ship will join the Taiwan Airlines route and serve as the basic foundation for restoring communication and shipping between Taiwan and the mainland. It is said that it will soon be tested. On this day when domestic and foreign transportation is virtually cut off, the naming of this ship has given the people of the isolated island a lot of excitement, which is also the best good news for the New Year.

Enduring Humiliation for Fifty Years, Emerging Unstained from the Mud

Looking again at the grand parade held in Taipei City in the afternoon, I felt even more that the people of Taiwan are lovely. However, what I mean by lovely is not any grand and high-sounding term, nor is it because the people of Taiwan can cater to and respect their superiors like the people of Shanghai and use money to win their favor. Comparatively, the people of Taiwan are rigid and absolutely do not understand how to destroy themselves or corrupt their officials with sensual pleasures and extravagance. What I mean by lovely is that after fifty years ofæ²¦è, after suffering all kinds ofæ¬ºå and oppression, and after so-called enslavement education, except for a very small number of åµæ°, they were able to emerge unstained from the mud, without losing the personality of the Chinese people at all, and with the sincerity of enthusiastically joining the embrace of the motherland. During this large parade, the reporter saw through the window the enthusiasm of the boys and girls in elementary school holding national flags and singing happily. Everyone tried their best to shout, expanding their lungs and full of spirit. This released all the accumulated hatred of the past fifty years and the joy of today.

Furthermore, although the people of Taiwan have been subjected to civilian education under Japanese rule and oppression, their level is also higher than that of the mainland. This can be seen from the widespread sale of newspapers. After the Taiwan Shin Sheng Daily was taken over and reorganized from the Japanese Taiwan Shin Pao, although its sales fell sharply due to language issues, it still has 150,000 copies now, which is quite a surprising number. Furthermore, the symphony concert held at the Public Hall tonight also shows the high level of civic education in Taiwan. The entire symphony orchestra has more than 80 people, conducted by the director Cai Jixian. According to Cai, all these 80-odd people are Chinese youth music talents recruited from all over Taiwan after the recovery of this lost land. After several months of training and rehearsal, they have achieved remarkable results. Without the high general education level of the Taiwanese people, how could this be achieved?

New Psychological Construction Can Be Expected to Be Completed Quickly

With the foundation of this civilian education, and the people have absolutely not lost their noble national character, the future of psychological construction for the people of Taiwan is really very promising, and its rapid completion can be expected. Administrative Governor Chen Yan expressed his hope for psychological construction in his New Year's Eve broadcast speech, saying that he intends to enable teachers and students throughout Taiwan to speak Mandarin, understand Chinese, and know Chinese history within one year of the thirty-fifth year. I believe this is absolutely possible, because the Taiwanese people are quite sincere in learning Mandarin and have made significant and rapid progress. Of course, the restoration of transportation between the province and the outside world, so that teachers who can speak Mandarin and teach Chinese can come here to work more, is also an urgent task that cannot be delayed any longer.

Because of the weakness of the country's power, Taiwan has been separated from the motherland for half a century. Now, with the success of the eight-year war of resistance, the lost land has been regained, and nothing is missing. The fate of Taiwan and the country is so closely related. If we want to maintain the integrity of our territory, we must first seek to maintain Taiwan. Those in power naturally have their own grand plans and contributions. The reporter aims to communicate the voices of Taiwan and the mainland, introduce the customs and culture of the people to other provinces, and within the possible scope, strive to fulfill the responsibility of being the voice of the people of Taiwan, to promote the implementation of various policies and the promotion of construction with opinions.

### Six Severely Damaged Yangtze River Steamers Set a New Record: An Interlude in the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Ship Repair History

â Xu Xueyu

Before the War of Resistance, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had a total of sixteen ocean-going vessels and twelve Yangtze River steamers.

In the early stages of the War of Resistance, after these ships completed their military and civilian transport missions, some were damaged by bombings, some were lost to the enemy, and others were sunk at strategic fortresses, never to resurface. Ultimately, only six Yangtze River steamers remained, braving the perilous Three Gorges with its swift currents and numerous shoals, setting a record for navigation on the Sichuan River. After more than a year, they safely retreated into Sichuan, bearing the scars of enemy fire all over their bodies.

Wounded River Steamers Seek Medical Attention in Sichuan

Even after entering Sichuan, safety was not guaranteed. The "Jiangjian" was sunk by enemy aircraft in September of the 29th year of the Republic (1940) at Taizi Bay in Badong, and the "Jianghua" was bombed again in Wanxian in August of the 30th year of the Republic (1941). After the "Jiangjian" was sunk, it took two years of salvage work to barely reach Chongqing. The "Jianghua" was bombed and burned, and not only were all the wooden fittings destroyed, but the iron plates and angle irons were also warped and twisted out of shape. In addition, the "Jiang'an," "Jiangshun," "Jiangxin," and "Jianghan" also suffered from neglect due to being idle for years and initially lacking funds for repairs. As a result, the damage they sustained during the war not only went untreated but also became increasingly severe.

At that time, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had already considered in advance that during the counter-offensive and post-war reconstruction period, there would be a great need for transportation in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. As long as these dilapidated river steamers could be repaired, they would still be a major force in post-war transport. Therefore, the company decided to repair them.

Financial and Human Resources Both Become Problems

Repairing them was easier said than done because it required money first, people second, and materials third.

The money issue was resolved with the special subsidies granted by our wealthy government, but due to the gradual soaring of prices and wages, the contract price for a project often exceeded the budget by a large margin. Before the project was even halfway completed, the contractor had already suffered losses due to the low contract price. In mild cases, they would request a price increase, and in severe cases, they would abandon the project and flee. This situation not only affected the finances but also affected the progress of the project.

The main problem with personnel was the lack of skilled workers. Most of the skilled workers in the rear were evacuated from Shanghai and Hankou, and their numbers were limited. Meanwhile, the emerging industries in the rear increased year by year, so the demand for skilled workers increased year by year. Factories spared no expense to poach skilled workers, so the phenomenon of workers jumping factories was ubiquitous. Often, projects that were actively underway were suspended halfway due to the departure of workers. Only those who experienced it firsthand at the time could deeply understand this difficulty.

Pebble and Sand Beaches as Natural Docks

Regarding materials, they could be divided into equipment and materials. In terms of equipment, firstly, there were no dry docks or floating docks in the rear, but it was necessary to repair the hull and axles below the waterline. There was no other way but to use the most primitive method to force it. After surveying along the riverbank, a large pebble and sand beach was found on the Tangjiatuo riverbank, seven nautical miles from Chongqing. The ground was very flat and the soil was firm. So, when the water was high, the ship was sailed out and moored on that beach, and then when the water receded, it was left aground there. At the same time, wooden stakes were quickly used to support the bottom of the ship to keep it stable, and then the sand and stones under the bottom of the ship were manually removed and wooden squares were placed. In this way, our natural dock was created. However, the dry season on the Sichuan River lasted only three or four months, so it was necessary to take advantage of this dry season to quickly complete the work of knocking off rust, scraping and painting the bottom of the ship, and replacing axles and sleeve liners, in order to float the ship during the high water season in spring. Speaking of floating the ship, it was a dangerous and arduous task. When the water was about to rise, manpower had to be prepared and kept watch day and night. As soon as the water level was appropriate, the fastest means had to be used to float the ship in the shortest possible time, remove the stakes, and start the machinery. Otherwise, the current of the Sichuan River was rapid, and if the ship's hull floated, and the stakes were not completely removed, the stakes would obstruct the ship, and the ship would rub against the stakes, causing serious consequences. If the machinery could not be started in time, then the danger would be even greater due to the water rushing the ship and drifting.

Temporary Workshops: Making Do with What Was Available

Secondly, there were no large lifting machines or equipment in the rear. Sometimes, to move a ship that was three hundred feet long, fifty feet wide, and three or four thousand tons in weight, we had to rely entirely on manpower using capstans. This was a very simple device, and each capstan required more than fifty people to operate, and could only lift thirty tons. Therefore, at times, dozens of them had to be used at once.

Thirdly, Tangjiatuo was a remote village where there was no electricity or factories. Therefore, larger or more complex parts had to be dismantled and transported by ship to Chongqing for repair and fitting. However, separate spare parts could not be fully fitted in Chongqing. A temporary factory was built on the beach using bamboo walls and reed mats. The lathes were hand-cranked, and the drills were foot-operated. Comparing this crude and simple factory with the shipyards in Shanghai, one would naturally feel like a minnow seeing a whale.

Material Shortages Affect Projects

As for materials, the situation was as follows. We must not shy away from the fact that the lack of materials was a common and serious phenomenon in the blockaded rear. Sichuan was a province that produced wood, but supply could not meet demand. To repair ships, people had to be sent to the mountains to purchase timber and transport it themselves in order to have it available. Metals were a major material for ship repairs, but this item was in particularly short supply. Rivets and screws had to be made from scrap iron. The most helpless situation was with "packing," which was a necessary material for ship repairs, but it was the most difficult to buy. Often, the lack of materials affected the progress of the project, resulting in delayed construction, increased costs, and ultimately forcing the contractor to escape.

Ships repaired under these difficult conditions naturally could not meet ideal standards. The goals of ship repair were: first, to be able to sail; second, to be safe. Beyond that, we did not dare to have any extravagant hopes. Therefore, the repaired ships were not comfortable, let alone beautiful.

Ship Repair Goals Successfully Achieved

Now the war has been won. Reconstruction is beginning, and the ships repaired by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have all set sail from Chongqing and have safely arrived in Shanghai. They are still continuing to engage in reconstruction and transport work. The above two goals have finally been achieved. However, all the equipment for passenger comfort is not complete enough. The authorities believe that only through enthusiastic service and future new ships can they do their best to make up for the current shortcomings.

### An Analysis of Post-War People's Hearts

â Chen Gaoyong

Recently, I have often seen articles in newspapers advising the government "not to lose the hearts of the people," and government authorities have repeatedly instructed receiving personnel to "pay attention to winning the hearts of the people during the reception work." However, people's hearts are different, each with their own face. Knowing a person's face but not their heart, even in personal interactions, trying to grasp the other person's psychology is already a difficult thing, let alone trying to grasp the psychology of a large crowd? Therefore, although I am not a person who specializes in the study of psychology, at a time when everyone is paying close attention to winning popular support, I would like to offer a simple analysis of the psychology of the Chinese people after the war.

The unprecedented eight-year long War of Resistance caused great stimulation to every Chinese person. Since the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred eight years ago, the nerves of the people throughout the country have gradually entered a state of extreme tension. Since then, the war has intensified, the war zones have expanded, and the stimulation suffered by the people has deepened. The people in the occupied areas were oppressed and ravaged by the enemy puppets, of course, seeking life but not death, while the people in the free areas, in addition to paying money and effort to support the War of Resistance, could not avoid being bombed, running, and fleeing from the hardship of displacement. In short, no matter where they were, the nerves of the Chinese people were in a state of unease. This life of nervous tension was certainly a painful life, but after eight years of long-term tension, this extraordinary life has unknowingly formed a habit. Once the War of Resistance was won, the environment changed, and everyone seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, and their nerves no longer had to be as tense as before, but the transition from tension to relaxation, from busyness to leisure, although initially felt comfortable, soon inevitably felt empty. Feeling empty naturally leads to new demands, and if the new demands cannot be concretely determined, or if they are determined but cannot be realized for a time, they will naturally express dissatisfaction with the current environment. This is the first point we should understand about people's hearts after the war.

The rise and fall of a country and nation, and the prosperity and harm of personal life, are closely related, which is well known to the people of all countries in the world. However, because education is not widespread in China, and people's knowledge is not developed, this most basic common sense of modern citizens, in the past, it can be said that most people were clueless. After eight years of the War of Resistance, the people in the occupied areas personally suffered hardships similar to or even worse than the loss of their country, and of course, they deeply realized the relationship between the country, the nation, and the individual. Even the people in the free areas, because they directly and indirectly engaged in eight years of long-term combat with the enemy, have also particularly strengthened the concept of the country and the nation. In short, during the long-term War of Resistance, the people throughout the country endured unbearable pain, living a life that was impossible to live. Everyone thought that once the War of Resistance was won, the country and the nation would immediately be revived, and personal life would be as beautiful and satisfactory, but the fact is not so simple and easy. The War of Resistance was difficult, and building the country still requires suffering. The personal life in the transitional period may not only not be beautiful and satisfactory, but even some places are the same as before or even worse than before, so it is inevitable to be disappointed and dissatisfied, and from dissatisfaction to resentment, but we must know that the country and the nation and the individual are closely related and their interests are consistent, and there is antagonism in the unity of relevance and consistency. Therefore, whether in the War of Resistance period or the nation-building period, when we pool our efforts to pay attention to the collective work of the country and the nation, personal life will inevitably be sacrificed to some extent. In the past, our people's contribution and sacrifice to the country and the nation during the War of Resistance were witnessed by the world, but the contribution and sacrifice of the Soviet people to their country during the construction of the Soviet Union and the completion of the two five-year plans should also be used as a historical lesson for us. However, these historical facts are by no means known to ordinary people, so it is only human nature that they are dissatisfied with the various situations after the war. This is the second point we should understand about people's hearts after the war.

Social order is easier to destroy than to build. If it is renewed through natural evolution and historical development, people do not feel it much. However, if external forces and crude means are used to mess up a naturally developing social order, and then restore the original state, it is like smashing a machine with violence and then repairing it, which is indeed a very difficult thing. If a family suffers war and is destroyed, and today it has to be re-arranged, or if a large family moves once, and it has to be arranged in an orderly manner, I am afraid it will take two or three weeks or a month or two. What about a country? In the occupied areas, the enemy puppets controlled the area for seven or eight years or even more than ten years, arbitrarily dividing the natural areas, recklessly overturning the organizational system, and doing their best to destroy education, culture, production, and construction, messing up a good Chinese society and making it completely unrecognizable. Under these circumstances, even if it is well organized, it cannot be restored to its original state in a short period of time. What's more, it cannot be said that the reception work in some places has not been able to be scientific and rationalized, and even a few people have used the reception to engage in private fraud, which is simply adding to the chaos. It can be said that it is inevitable that people will feel dissatisfied as a result. This is the third point we should understand about people's hearts after the war.

The victory of this War of Resistance made the Republic of China one of the four powers, which can be said to be an unprecedented great achievement in Chinese history. No one can deny that this great achievement was successfully led by Chairman Chiang, but it can be said that everyone who is a Chinese person is involved, except for the traitors who have lost their minds and the quasi-traitors who tend to be inflamed. Although the direct and indirect participation in the work is different, and the size of the achievements is different, everyone is the same in their determination to defeat the enemy and save the country from danger. Once the War of Resistance is won, the suffering has not completely gone away, but it seems to have gone away, and the gains have not yet been seen, but everyone thinks they will come soon. It is easy to share suffering, but difficult to share happiness, which has been the case since ancient times, and it is still the case today. Therefore, there are disputes over reception, disputes over reconstruction, disputes between parties, disputes between factions, disputes between agencies, and even disputes within the same agency, disputes over territory, disputes over power, and even disputes over a house, a car, or a desk. Of course, the people who get the fight have nothing to say, and the people who do not get the fight cannot help but feel resentment. In fact, both the people who get the fight and the people who do not get the fight still have the qualifications to fight. It is a pity that most of the pure and good people have contributed money and effort during the War of Resistance, and have been oppressed and ravaged by the enemy puppets, but when the victory comes, they can only watch a few people fight for this and that, and their spiritual and material losses over the past eight years have nowhere to ask, and they even have to continue to suffer losses in the midst of your fight. How can this make people's hearts calm? This is the fourth point we should understand about people's hearts after the war.

Traitors act as accomplices of tigers, selling out the nation and plundering the people. All Chinese people hate them deeply, and the loyal and faithful people hold the attitude that loyalty and treason cannot coexist. During the War of Resistance, everyone thought that once the war was won, these big and small traitors who had lost their minds would certainly not escape the judgment of the national law. However, three or four months after the victory, it is impossible to know the exact number of traitors who have been caught, but traitors are everywhere. Small traitors are still at large, and even those who have changed their identities and are still engaged in public service are everywhere. The major traitors who have not been arrested, and even those who are still posing as celebrities and important people, are not necessarily non-existent. On the other hand, the people who have been loyal and unyielding for eight years are still living their poor lives, and even those who were once claws of the enemy puppets are now bullying the victorious officials. What injustice in the world is greater than this? Of course, the Regulations on Punishing Traitors have been officially announced by the state, and the arrest and trial of traitors have also begun. The government is by no means ignoring this matter, but the people's resentment towards traitors over the past eight years always feels that the government's handling of the scum of the nation is not strict enough, fast enough, and common enough. This is the fifth point we should understand about people's hearts after the war.

Living apart from loved ones is a source of suffering for people. For eight years of war, families were displaced. Once victory was achieved, everyone thought they could be reunited with their families and enjoy the joys of family life again. Who knew that the suffering of inconvenient transportation in the past three or four months was still no different from the war period, such as the railways in North China being dismantled, and trains being destroyed. Inconvenient transportation was even worse than during the war. Therefore, fathers and sons who have not seen each other for eight years, and brothers, wives, and children who have been separated, can only "raise their heads to look at the bright moon, and bow their heads to think of their hometown," and "wish people a long life, and share the beautiful scenery for thousands of miles." This phenomenon is of course temporary, but in the hearts of those who have been displaced for many years, it is a great anxiety. This is the sixth point we should understand about people's hearts after the war.

Businessmen, no matter how they understand the country and the nation, their first purpose is always to make profits and get rich. During the War of Resistance, whether in the free area or the occupied area, it cannot be denied that there were many people who made a fortune and got rich by taking advantage of the national crisis. The ability of these people who made a fortune from the national crisis was speculation and hoarding. After the victory, speculators had no opportunity to speculate, and hoarders had no goods to hoard. Seeing their property dwindle day by day, and feeling that the future of national production was bleak and there was no way to start, they also had to express a kind of anxious psychology. We do not need to sympathize with these people who are diligent in making money for themselves, but if we can guide them to embark on the road of national production, it cannot be considered a force for the country's economic construction. This is the seventh point we should understand about people's hearts after the war.

The above are the more obvious points revealed by people's hearts after the war. Based on these seven points, we can come to a conclusion: The people throughout the country unanimously expressed their sincere admiration for Chairman Chiang's leadership in winning the glorious victory in the War of Resistance, while they believed that some of the work of some members of the government could not meet their expectations; they felt that the future of the country and the nation had a new life, while they felt that their current real life was still extremely difficult and poor. In short, they have endured enough long-term pain for eight years, and hope that there will be no unnecessary pain to torment them in the future. Whoever can understand the psychology of the people can win the support of the people!

### Gold and Banknote Market Steady, Chinese Stocks Reach New Highs, Public Debt and Foreign Stock Buying Enthusiasm

Yesterday, the gold market was quite stable, with both bulls and bears competing fiercely. Arbitrage sales and arbitrage purchases were also inconsistent, leading to endless contention. However, with the surge in securities, floating capital after profits flowed in steadily, resulting in a recovery of 10,000 [yuan] better than before. Throughout the day, morale was slightly more excited than in the previous few days. However, retail investors were immersed in securities, and although the gold market was driven up, it was somewhat inferior. Paper merchants and large households shorted a lot, so it is necessary to guard against a rebound. Gold ornaments at jewelry stores were listed at 85,000 [yuan], silver taels were still at 600 yuan, and silver dollars were also fixed at 440 [yuan]. The secret exchange rate was still loose, about 8 to 10 percent.

The U.S. dollar also fluctuated with the gold market, with limited trading. All parties were waiting for the opportunity, and large households were not very active. Factories slightly absorbed at low prices, which helped to support it. The morning opened at 1380 yuan, then slowly rose, and in the afternoon, it broke through the 1400 yuan mark, resulting in an increase of 15 yuan compared to the previous close. Old Hong Kong banknotes were affected by the increase in Shanghai banknotes in Hong Kong, and the supply was more enthusiastic. New Hong Kong banknotes were stable, resulting in a drop of 5 yuan for old Hong Kong banknotes and an increase of 1 yuan for new Hong Kong banknotes.

The buying side of public debt was still enthusiastic. The C bond opened at 815 yuan in the morning and then improved all the way, with demand exceeding supply. However, the process was mediocre and there were no special performances. The soaring of Chinese and foreign stocks boosted the buying sentiment in the debt market a lot, with the highest price reaching 900 yuan, resulting in an increase of 5 to 70 yuan compared to the previous close. The Chinese stock market continued to work hard. Paper companies, with the help of Jinli [bank], bought Yongsheng [textile company]. Securities companies had different comings and goings. Although some of them flowed to the gold market, the stock market was lively and soon some of them returned. The Securities Association had high hopes, so both popular and unpopular stocks were favored. In particular, Yongsheng Yarn dominated, leading the way forward, and the highest price was even over 1,000 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yongsheng Yarn rose by 80 yuan, Meiya by 85 yuan, and the "Three Small" popular stocks rose by about 10%. People in the industry said that because foreign stock Yishah rose to over 3,000, according to asset calculation, Yongsheng's machinery was new and it had already started production, and the current price was still cheaper. The paper and yarn companies worked hard to get Yongsheng, and the future trend would be good.

Foreign stocks echoed Chinese stocks and continued to rise. However, there were few sellers at high prices, and there was a lot of hovering after the rise. However, buyers rose one after another, and popular stocks such as Yishah, beer, and paper were the targets of searching. Yishah even closed at the buying price, and as a result, compared to the previous close, popular stocks rose by 20% and unpopular stocks rose by about 10%.

### Rice Market Stable, Yellow Beans and Raw Peanuts Continue to Be Popular

Rice sales were still lax, and the source continued. Both northern and southern japonica rice fell slightly by 100 to 200 yuan. Indica rice was scarce and still firm, and glutinous rice also had few ups and downs. According to Mr. Yang of the Grain Administration Commissioner's Office, the amount of rice and grain transported into the city every day was about 20,000 shi at most and 10,000 shi at least, and the average was about 15,000 shi. It is estimated that the current rice storage in the city reaches about 300,000 shi.

The oil market was active due to the fluctuations in Hangzhou and Ningbo, and the price was active, rising by hundreds of yuan. Flour sales in Fujian were very smooth, and the market was still trending firmly. Yellow beans from Xinghua and Quanzhou moved slightly, and the market was also quite strong. Corn was similar, and raw peanuts were still in demand, rising by more than 1,000 yuan. Bean cake demand in Taiwan weakened and fell slightly by 100 yuan.

### The Grain Industry's Complex Composition Urgently Needs Unification

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] According to statistics from the Shanghai Grain Administration Special Commissioner's Office, by the end of last year, a total of 81 soybean and rice wholesale businesses in the city had registered with the office, along with 780 soybean and rice retail shops and 57 coarse grain wholesalers. In addition, there were some coarse grain merchants and rice merchants who had not registered but were already operating, accounting for 40% of the total. Therefore, there are actually about 1,500 soybean and rice retailers operating in the city. The Grain Administration Special Commissioner's Office has adopted a policy of encouraging grain merchants to freely purchase and operate, so the number of newly established grain stores and retail outlets is increasing rapidly, more than ten times the number during the enemy-puppet's control of food. However, due to the excessively complex composition of food and oil businesses, the organizations that have established trade associations include: (1) the soybean and rice industry; (2) the coarse grain and oil cake industry; (3) the rice store industry; (4) the coarse grain retail industry; (5) the noodle and bran collective; and (6) the rice milling industry. Although there are six industries, their nature is roughly the same, and one business often engages in other industries as well. Therefore, Chen Chaofu and others have submitted a request to the Grain Ministry's Special Commissioner's Office, asking for unified management to avoid disputes. It is reported that the Bureau of Social Affairs has ordered the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to review and respond to the request.

### Soviet Union Procures Tungsten Ore and Tea

[Reuter's Dispatch from Chongqing, 5th] Since the establishment of the Foreign Trade Bureau of the Resources Committee, China has sold 1,800 tons of tungsten ore to the Soviet Union. It is also reported that the Soviet Union has ordered 200,000 cases of tea from China.

### Coal is in Season and Selling Well

The coal market is bustling with activity, and user demand remains strong. Sellers are frequently quoting high prices, so the upward trend has slowed down slightly. The arrival of firewood from overseas has become crowded again, but the actual sales to small retailers in this area are still strong, and the market situation is stable.

Another report states that the main reason for the recent surge in the coal market is that the coal reserves for civilian use in Shanghai have been depleted, resulting in supply falling short of demand. Some financially strong businesses, recognizing this, have turned to Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and other places along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line before the holidays to purchase coal for storage. They are now selling it at high prices in the market. At the same time, some briquette factories are also purchasing white coal from the Hankou area of the Yangtze River.

### The Goods Tax Bureau Improves the Method of Tax Payment for Cotton Fabrics: Small Transactions of Ten Bolts or Less Will Be Issued Certificates by the Trade Association

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Machine Dyeing and Weaving Trade Association previously submitted a document to the Goods Tax Bureau requesting improvement of the regulations for tax payment certificates for scattered bolts of fabric. This has been approved. For small transactions of ten bolts or less and bolts sold within the city, the trade association will issue certificates for transportation and sale. However, the certificate must be submitted to the bureau along with the original tax bill (cotton yarn tax payment certificate) through the trade association for stamping, and the quantity transported must be noted on the back for verification.

### Raw Silk is Difficult to Trade

For high-quality raw silk from factories, foreign firms have entrusted agencies to handle sales, so the volume of transactions is not weak. Prices have risen by about 100,000 yuan due to the slight improvement in the gold market. Ordinary extra lots and five-lot goods have risen by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Thousand-strand silk is stable, and transactions are generally average.

There is demand for rayon, and sales are active. People are confident, and the market is thriving.

### Hong Kong and Guangdong Merchants Scramble for 20-Count Double Horse Yarn

Yesterday, the yarn market was relatively stable. Customers from Hong Kong and Guangdong continued to demand 20-count heavyweight Double Horse yarn. Spot prices started at 800,000 yuan and rose to a new high of 850,000 yuan, a unique increase of 50,000 yuan. The sales of other 20-count brands were minimal, and many firms were trying to sell them, but transactions were scarce. The buying and selling of fine yarn and double-strand yarn was also not as enthusiastic as in the previous few days, and prices were similar to the previous day, with the trend seemingly gradually entering a soft state.

### Dyeing and Weaving Factories Apply to De Fu Foreign Firm to Purchase Goods

[Report from This Newspaper] After the De Fu Foreign Firm was taken over for liquidation by the Enemy and Puppet Industries Processing Bureau, it has recently decided to sell off its inventory. The part that the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Special Commissioner's Office has reserved for state-run factories has not yet been determined. It is said that the sales volume is strictly limited. The Dyeing and Weaving Trade Association has consulted with the responsible person of the firm several times and decided that each factory should first register with the firm. After the firm sends someone to investigate and prove that the factory urgently needs dyes for manufacturing, it can then fill out an application form to purchase. However, it is still unknown how much of this application can be allocated. It is only known that the application form is divided into two types: Type A is for factories that own cloth and urgently need dyes for processing; Type B is for factories that have accepted commissions from customers to dye on their behalf and urgently need dyes. Both types must be stamped and certified by the trade association before the firm will review them. The Dyeing and Weaving Trade Association has sent letters to its member factories to register and apply for purchase according to the regulations.

### White Tung Oil Exports are Active, but the Foreign Exchange Rate is Undetermined, and the Future Market is Uncertain

Before the war, white tung oil was mainly for export, with the United States accounting for 70% to 80% of the sales. However, due to the outbreak of the international war, exports ceased, and transportation in the interior was severely hindered. Therefore, after currency inflation, the price increase was not as severe as other goods. Recently, with the end of the war and the gradual resumption of international trade, there have already been several batches of white tung oil exported. Recently, demand has increased, and purchase prices in various places have increased. It is reported that Hangzhou dealers are selling at 26,000 yuan, while local firms in Shanghai need to purchase at 28,000 to 29,000 yuan. However, there are very few that meet the grade. Selling to foreign firms requires 32,000 yuan. However, because the foreign exchange rate has not been announced, there is little certainty about the future market.

### Dyeing Factories Adjust New Prices

[Report from This Newspaper] The Dyeing and Weaving Trade Association organized a meeting of dyeing group members, most of whom are also engaged in dyeing for customers, yesterday at the trade association. More than 20 companies attended, and they discussed business reforms and dyeing price adjustments. It was decided that the trade association would set a standard dyeing price for all to follow. It is reported that the price for 190 silk-mercerized Shilin is 14,000 yuan (per bolt), light-colored Shilin is 10,000 yuan, Patriotic Blue is 7,000 yuan, original color is 5,000 yuan, and gray is 4,000 yuan. Prices for naphthol, An'an Blue, and Haichang Blue have also been agreed upon and will be announced and implemented by the trade association starting tomorrow (Monday). Furthermore, the trade association believes that the colors of military uniforms dyed by member factories are not uniform, which not only damages the appearance of the national army but also affects the reputation of the trade association. It has been decided to submit a report to Special Commissioner Zhao of the Ministry of Military Affairs, requesting that the trade association be responsible for improving the products.

### Cigarettes Rise

The cigarette market has been weak for many days, and with the slight recovery in the gold market, people's confidence has turned firm, buying activity has increased, and prices are rising slowly. Afternoon trading was flat, and apart from Yizhong products continuing to perform well, Chinese-made cigarettes were stable.

### Summary of Commercial News

Sugar Market: Xinghua white, cotton white, and blue sugar prices are stable, but Taiwan rock sugar is out of stock, causing local rock sugar and Fujian rock sugar to be raised by 30% to 40%.

Dried and Fresh Goods: Sales remain strong, prices are rising steadily, and high-end goods are frequently being snapped up by customers, causing low-end goods to become popular and their value to increase invisibly.

Dyes: Customers are generally taking a wait-and-see approach, and the trend is stable with a slight improvement, but it is not easy to revive for the time being.

Cotton Cloth: Sichuan merchants are actively purchasing dyed goods again, and dyeing and weaving factories are vigorously purchasing white grey cloth. Holders of spot goods and factory warehouse receipts are reluctant to sell easily, and the market has a thriving trend.

Knitted Goods: Yesterday, due to the rising price of yarn, 32-count socks and Queen velvet shirts have all risen. Sweatshirt transactions have increased, and general observations suggest that it will be difficult to return to small sizes in the short term.

### Shanghai Commercial Groups Urge Exemption from Income Tax, Truly Support Industrial and Commercial Enterprises, and Complete the Great Task of National Construction in the Future

[Report from This Newspaper] There are a total of about 200 trade associations in the city. Recently, due to the decline of all industries after the war and the incompleteness of accounting books, they fear that the government will misunderstand the actual situation and levy income tax on the false surplus caused by the consolidation of book capital amounts. Industrial and commercial enterprises will inevitably be unable to bear it. Previously, at a reception for Comfort Envoy, Supervisory Envoy, and Vice Minister Hong of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Pan Shihao, the representative of the Dyeing and Weaving Trade Association and the Cotton Cloth Trade Association, spoke, requesting the government to exempt income tax for the 34th year. Jin Runxiang, Luo Qinghua, and others supported this view, and the entire audience unanimously agreed. After the meeting, an official document was formally prepared, and the trade associations jointly petitioned the Executive Yuan. The main points are summarized as follows:

It is Unreasonable to Tax a Fictitious Account

In the case of the conversion of puppet currency capital by industrial and commercial enterprises in the city, the trade associations, under the careful consultation of the Industrial and Commercial Law Regulations Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, have studied the actual situation in detail, solicited expert opinions, and discussed the conversion standards. They all believe that there are reasonable accounting standards to follow for the conversion of puppet currency capital into legal currency. However, if the resulting false surplus is taxed according to the Income Tax and Profit Tax Law, it would not only be unreasonable in accounting but also impossible to implement in the tax procedure.

Commercial Enterprises After the Calamity Cannot Afford the Burden

Moreover, industrial and commercial enterprises have been devastated by the long-term oppression of the enemy and puppets for eight years. They are already in a state of decline, and the burden cannot be increased. The merchants have no profitability to speak of. According to the principles of taxation, the emphasis is on fair burden. Direct taxes such as income tax are indeed reasonable and good taxes. In modern advanced countries, they all use this as a key component of national tax revenue. When China promulgated the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax in the 25th year, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the trade associations took the lead in supporting it and convened tax regulations research meetings, held accounting technology lectures, and started training classes to assist in the implementation. Their achievements can be used as a model for the whole country and can be reviewed. After the War of Resistance, all industries in the city have suffered devastation, production has decreased, materials have decreased, and markets have been cut off. Although there is an appearance of wealth on paper due to the low value of puppet currency, in reality, the raw materials and goods of industrial and commercial enterprises cannot maintain their pre-war status. There are obvious profits but hidden losses, which is the case for all industries. Their vitality has been exhausted, and recovery is difficult. If the government insists on taxing this false surplus, factories will inevitably sell their production tools, and stores will sell off their remaining goods. This would be like draining the pond to catch all the fish. Not only would it be impossible to cultivate tax sources, but it would also make it impossible for industrial and commercial enterprises in the city to maintain themselves. As a result, even if industries want to go bankrupt and pay taxes, they may not find a buyer. The government would have no choice but to confiscate the factories' assets and commodities, nationalize them, and collect taxes, which is not what the government wants.

Excessive Profit Tax Should be Suspended

Furthermore, income tax and profit tax, when levied on profit-making enterprises, must be based on the actual net profit earned in business as the purpose of taxation. The true meaning of fair burden, which is promoted by modern direct tax laws, lies in this. Now that the enemy has surrendered and the war has ended, the excessive profit tax, which was promulgated during the extraordinary period of the war, should be suspended according to the law. There is no doubt that the income tax of profit-making enterprises should be calculated and levied according to the actual net profit of the profit-making enterprises. Therefore, the false surplus generated by the expansion of puppet currency in industrial and commercial enterprises in the recovered areas cannot be regarded as the purpose of taxation, and the reason is even more obvious.

Profit Income Should be Exempted from Tax

Moreover, after being exploited by the enemy and puppets, industrial and commercial enterprises in Shanghai have incomplete business facilities, inventory storage, and accounting records in order to avoid detection by the enemy and puppets when providing manpower, materials, and funds to the rear area and when responding to government bonds and donations. If the tax authorities insist on levying taxes when reorganizing and revitalizing, how will they calculate it? It is inevitable to cause harsh demands by making arbitrary estimates of things that cannot be calculated, which would disappoint and undermine the people's expectations and faith in the government. Based on the above reasons, the trade associations unanimously urge the government to provide genuine support to industrial and commercial enterprises in the recovered areas in order to achieve economic recovery and develop the great cause of national construction in the future. They respectfully request that the government, for the income tax of profit-making enterprises in the 34th year, refer to the precedent of exempting land tax in the recovered areas and issue an order to exempt it, so as to benefit industry and commerce and cultivate tax sources.

Education and Sports

### Mr. Wang Fengjie Reports to the Central Government on Hunan Province's Education Recovery Plan and Describes the Losses of Educational Institutions During the War

[Special Dispatch from Changsha from This Newspaper] Mr. Wang Fengjie, Director of the Hunan Education Department, recently reported to the Central Government on the wartime losses of educational institutions in Hunan Province and the education recovery plan for the future. The general idea is as follows: From March of the 27th year, enemy planes indiscriminately bombed cities of all sizes in Hunan Province, deliberately destroying educational institutions, resulting in extremely heavy losses. In May of the 27th year, the enemy launched a large-scale southward offensive from northern Hunan, and the major cities of Changsha and Hengyang were successively lost. Seventy to eighty percent of the counties and cities along the Yuehan and Xianggui Roads and the periphery of Changsha and Hengyang fell into enemy hands. Until the Xiangxi Campaign in April of the 34th year, even the remote counties of western Hunan were harassed by the enemy.

Wartime Losses

In terms of the educational institutions in the province alone, the losses are as follows: The total value of provincial educational institutions and provincial schools at all levels is approximately 21.62435 billion yuan. The total value of county, city, township, and bao schools is approximately 17.33372 billion yuan. The total value of county and city education funds, such as land rent and real estate, is approximately 3.22992 billion yuan. The total value of county and city social education institutions is 1.67108 billion yuan. The total value of county-level and privately-funded middle schools is 4.056942 billion yuan. The total value of county and city primary schools is approximately 6.20928 million yuan. The total loss is approximately 89.72057 billion yuan. As for the future education recovery plan for Hunan, it consists of three parts:

Higher Education Recovery

(1) In terms of higher education, the provincial agricultural, industrial, and commercial vocational schools will be restored and strengthened. Before the war, these three schools were located in Nanyue. In the future, based on geographical environment and needs, it is planned to combine the commercial school with the provincial vocational school No. 2 and relocate it to Hengyang. The industrial school will be combined with the provincial vocational school No. 1 and relocated to Changsha. The agricultural school will be combined with the provincial vocational school No. 4 and relocated to __ County. The Ministry of Education also plans to expand the National Xiangtan University and add agricultural and commercial colleges. The National Normal College in Lantian will be relocated to Nanyue or Hengyang.

Secondary Education Recovery

(2) In terms of secondary education, before the war, there were a total of 38 provincial secondary schools (including normal schools and vocational schools). Those that were suspended, merged, or relocated due to the war will be restored within the 35th year. Before the war, there were a total of 98 county-level and joint secondary schools, which will be supervised by the county and city governments to restore them all within the 35th year. Before the war, there were a total of 181 private secondary schools. In order to promote the popularization of secondary education, private secondary schools should not be concentrated in cities. Those that were temporarily established or suspended during the war must be established or prepared for restoration this year.

Primary Education Recovery

(3) In terms of primary schools, before the war, there were a total of 34,604 schools. 8,350 schools were damaged during the war. In the future, it is necessary to restore the public and private primary schools and township and bao schools in the disaster-stricken areas. At the same time, the public and private education funds should be cleared, so that all schools can be restored to their former appearance by the end of this year. Hunan's primary and secondary education was particularly developed before the war, so the enemy's disaster losses were also very large. Large amounts of money are needed for recovery in the future, and it is hoped that the central government can provide subsidies. Relocating schools and building school buildings require large amounts of money. (Person)

### The National Education Recovery Conference Decided to Form a European and American Education Visiting Group to Elaborate on the Reasons and Methods and Request the Ministry of Education to Handle It at Its Discretion

[Report from the Great China News Agency in Chongqing] The Ministry of Education's National Education Recovery Conference decided to form a European and American Education Visiting Group, elaborate on the reasons and methods, and submit them to the Ministry of Education for consideration. The following is the record:

Reasons

During the Allied operations, the educational policies and facilities of the United Kingdom and the United States were very well adapted to the wartime environment. For example, many universities in the United Kingdom and the United States were able to assist the government by adding various military training classes and providing a large number of talents for government requisition. The research, invention, and application of the atomic bomb were also successful due to the efforts of scholars in both countries. Therefore, in order to understand the true situation of education in the United Kingdom and the United States during the war, it seems necessary for us to organize a visiting group to investigate. This is one reason. The United Kingdom and the United States have made thorough preparations for post-war education plans and policies, and there must be many that can be used for our country's reference. Moreover, their educational facilities will inevitably directly or indirectly affect the world's political parties. Therefore, in order to learn from our country's recovery and understand the future trends of world education, it is also necessary for us to organize a visiting group to investigate. This is two reasons. After eight years of arduous war, the rear area and the occupied area, under the guidance of the central government, have fought hard and made great contributions. The resolutions and policies of this National Education Recovery Conference will inevitably represent the spirit and policies of our country's resistance and national construction. Therefore, it is also necessary to use this visiting group to promote our spirit of resistance and construction overseas. This is three reasons. Most of the universities and higher education institutions in the democratic countries of the United Kingdom and the United States are privately or church-founded, or although they are subsidized by the government, their administration and decision-making are independent. There will be many British and American cultural and educational undertakings that can cooperate with us after the war. Therefore, it is an essential step for the government and public and private universities to jointly send people to work hard to carry out liaison work at this time.

Methods

(1) Eight to ten people should be selected by the National Education Recovery Conference to form a "Chinese Education Visiting Group" to visit and investigate British and American educational and cultural figures and groups. The Ministry of Education will send two people, and the conference will select two representatives from national universities, two representatives from private universities, and four people jointly recommended by educational groups to form the group. (2) The representatives should be those who have academic status and are reputable in the United Kingdom and the United States.

### Yichang and Other Regions Plan to Establish Industrial and Commercial Vocational Schools

[Special Dispatch from Hankou from This Newspaper] In order to adapt to the economic and production conditions of various regions, the Hubei Education Department is planning to establish various industrial and commercial vocational schools in appropriate regions. It has been decided to establish an Electrical Engineering Vocational School in Yichang, a Mining and Metallurgical Vocational School in Daye and Hanyang, a Commercial Vocational School in Hankou and Shashi, a Papermaking and Printing Vocational School in Chenjiaji, and an Aquaculture Vocational School in Mianyang. Yichang is the area where the world's large-scale hydroelectric project is being designed, Hanyang and Daye are well-known coal and iron production and manufacturing areas in the past, Mianyang is the area with the most rivers and lakes in the country, and Shashi and Hankou are commercial centers. The establishment of these schools is based on these situations. (Important)

### The Shanghai District Qualification Review Committee Requests Changes to the Qualification Review Methods: Students from Puppet Schools Can Directly Enter Remedial Classes

[Report from This City] Since receiving the Ministry of Education's qualification review methods, the Ministry of Education's Shanghai District Qualification Review Committee has now referred to the actual situation in this city and intends to make slight changes to the qualification review methods. In particular, students who have not graduated will be allowed to enter remedial classes without qualification review, and the issue of how to reward professors who were loyal and steadfast in their positions during the enemy and puppet occupation has also been submitted to the Ministry of Education for suggestions. After the reply telegram arrives in Shanghai, the qualification review work will be implemented step by step.

### Basketball Charity Match Opens: Shantou Team Loses to the US Air Force, Hualian Defeats the Signal Team; Two More Matches Will Be Held Tonight Starting at 7:00 PM

The basketball charity match organized by the City Sports Association opened last night at 7:00 PM at the City Sports Hall on Albert Road. Fans were crowded to enjoy the wonderful skills of the Chinese and American teams. As a result of the competition, Hualian defeated the US Army Signal Team with a score of 41 to 32. The Shantou team lost to the US Air Force Jiangwan Team with a score of 51 to 46. Two more matches will be held tonight starting at 7:00 PM at the same location.

In the first match, the Shantou team played against the US Air Force Jiangwan Team. After the start of the match, the situation became a seesaw battle. Both sides made accurate shots, and Lin Weicong and Smadar were the keys to scoring for both teams. The Shantou team took the lead at 11 to 7 and 13 to 9 in extreme tension. At the end of the first half, the score was 18 to 18, and the victory was not yet determined. The situation remained the same in the second half. The Shantou team failed to surpass and remained closely behind. As a result, the US Air Force Jiangwan Team won with a score of 51 to 46.

The next match was between Hualian and the US Signal Team. Wu Shaoshu performed the opening ceremony. Kraton made the first basket, and Hualian chased hard. Chen Xuechong's shots seemed to be divinely assisted, so he was able to lead step by step. Hualian took the lead with a score of 20 to 15 in the first half.

During the break, a long strip of white cloth reported the total income, which was 257,500 yuan. Then, the charity ball was auctioned off, starting at 50,000, and the crowd competed for it. Finally, Hou Xueshi, the representative of Xu Guanqun, won it for 150,000 yuan. Continuing the battle, although Hualian made major personnel adjustments, the situation still took precedence. The US Signal Team tried to save the game, but their skills were not as good. Helpless, Hualian finally won with a score of 41 to 32.

More Matches Tonight

The charity match will continue with two matches starting at 7:00 PM this afternoon. The proceeds will be used for education loans. The authorities have specially invited Director Gu of the Education Bureau to preside over the opening ceremony. Tickets are still divided into two types: 300 yuan and 500 yuan. The order is as follows:

South China - US Signal Team at 7:00 PM

Hualian - Jiangwan Team at 8:00 PM

### East China Team Wins Decisively: 6-2 Victory Over Soviet Union, Today Qingbai Plays Against Jewish Team

Yesterday afternoon, at the Jiaozhou Park soccer field, fans flocked in. The East China team made its debut in the soccer league and won decisively. The match resulted in a 6-2 victory over the Soviet Union, with the score at 3-1 for each half.

At the start of the match, the Soviet Union launched a relentless attack, and East China couldn't find a way to score. It wasn't until the 20th minute that Jia Youliang took a powerful shot. Esipu received the ball but lost it, and Han Longhai followed up with a swift kick, finding the back of the net and opening the scoring. Soon after, the Soviet Union's Olov managed to score, leveling the score. East China launched a major offensive, and Han Longhai relied on his relentless rushes to score again. Song Lingsheng then fired a long-range shot from beyond the 20-yard mark, resulting in a score of 3-1 by halftime. Shortly after the start of the second half, Li Ning committed a foul, resulting in a penalty kick. Mai Qidang converted it successfully, making the score 3-2.

Today's league matches include one Group B match, three Group B matches, and four Group C matches, still to be played at Jiaozhou Park and Hongkou Park. There was originally one Group A match, but the Italian Overseas Chinese team has withdrawn, so there will be no matches in the morning. At 2:30 PM, Qingbai will play against the Jewish team at Jiaozhou Park. Qingbai's invited players from Chongqing and Hong Kong have not yet arrived in Shanghai, so their strength may not be at the ideal level. The Jewish team's lineup includes Italian player Mai Ni Di Bao Jie, making them a formidable opponent. Therefore, Qingbai must be careful in today's match. Today's schedule is as follows:

Qingbai vs. Jewish (Group A) 2:30 PM, Jiaozhou Park

### Pay Attention to Elementary Education in the Nine Northeastern Provinces

â Zhanghua

The situation in the Nine Northeastern Provinces can now be described as clear: the Communist army has reportedly been ordered to withdraw, and the Sino-Soviet negotiations have been quite successful. Changchun and Shenyang have been taken over, and a branch of the Central Bank has already opened in Changchun. The National Army's airlift to the Northeast has also begun. This series of events has filled the Nine Northeastern Provinces with joy. Indeed, it is not limited to the Nine Northeastern Provinces alone; people across the country are feeling happy and excited about the clearing of the clouds. However, I personally have a lingering worry. Some may laugh, but my concern is that in the midst of this busy takeover, we might forget to take over a group of people: the children of the entire Nine Northeastern Provinces.

I remember that in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, there was a popular patriotic song called "Return to Our Old Home". It powerfully cried out: "The Northeast is ours!" For fourteen years, we have not forgotten this statement. Now, I want to shout: "The people of the Nine Northeastern Provinces are ours!" Naturally, children are included. Perhaps this isn't really a problem, but if we just consider the spiritual shackles that the enemy imposed on our compatriots in the Northeast for fourteen years, it is enough to alarm us. The reason I specifically mention the children of the Nine Northeastern Provinces is twofold: first, the Nine Northeastern Provinces were occupied for the longest time and were most deeply poisoned, and second, children have the greatest plasticity and can be molded as desired. A few days ago, Dagongbao published Ge Yandi's "Dialogue with Takako Yamagishi", in which she mentioned that she runs a kindergarten and also primary and secondary schools in Pudong. I am really worried about what they are teaching. Regarding this, all compatriots who care about China's fate would not trust her, would they?

What is the reality? Let me transcribe a passage. This incident occurred at a Japanese commercial school in Hongkou after it was taken over and renamed Shanghai Municipal Schotter Road Primary School. During the busy enrollment period, a teacher saw us enter and couldn't help but say with emotion: "Look! This is the result of enslaved education. This afternoon, more than a dozen children have come to enroll. When they are asked to fill out the application form and write their age, they always write the character 'æ' (talent) instead of 'æ­²' (years). In total, we received twenty application forms, and only one person managed to write the character 'æ­²' correctly." Moreover, this is not only the case in Hongkou but also in the former concessions, not only in primary schools but also in middle schools and universities. The enemy occupied Shanghai for only four years, while the Nine Northeastern Provinces were occupied for a full fourteen years. We don't need to talk about the danger of cultural destruction, nor do we need to count the historical relationship between cultural education and national rise and fall. But in this great era, as the whole country moves forward in unison and the whole world moves towards a new path, we can't help but think about the evil consequences that enslaved education may produce. If the war had been extended for another ten years, our compatriots who had been deceived by the enemy might have become the culprits of the war, one day pointing their weapons at the motherland. This is not an exaggeration. Now that we have fortunately won, how to make our compatriots devout believers in peace and protectors of peace is something we should deeply consider and strive for, especially for children.

No sowing, no harvest. Without the seedlings of the nation, when the old and strong die, the country will be finished. If we have seedlings but they are all poisonous "poppies", then a dark age can certainly be predicted in the future. If we don't purify the poison in these seedlings, I tell you, darkness lies ahead. In fact, this is not just the responsibility of the schools. In addition to the teachers, every child's elder should tell them stories about the country and the fertile soil of the motherland. In conclusion, I shout: "Primary school teachers, go to the Nine Northeastern Provinces!"

### Songhu Garrison Headquarters Uncovers Japanese Secret Organization, Plotting Large-Scale Riots

[Special Report] On the 11th of last month, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters uncovered an unprecedented, organized, and planned Japanese secret military organization that attempted to launch large-scale riots in the city. At that time, the headquarters dispatched its entire staff to raid the hideout in the dead of night, capturing all the perpetrators in one fell swoop. A total of 26 key Chinese and Japanese criminals were apprehended, and a large quantity of military fire, ammunition, forged symbols, radios, military telephones, super-adhesive agents, armor, and other items were seized. After several interrogations by the military law office, due to the seriousness of the case, a platoon of soldiers was specially dispatched yesterday to escort them to the Nanjing Army Headquarters. The details are as follows:

One Sweep Nets 26 Criminals

In early last month, the Investigation Department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters learned that the Japanese had established a secret military organization in Shanghai, intending to disrupt public order. The department immediately dispatched its staff to investigate in all directions. After obtaining leads, they surrounded and raided the hideouts on the 11th of last month in the dead of night. At 142 Yalu Road, the main culprit, Miyarazhi, also known as Miyarazhi, and his accomplices Chen Yifei, Chen Congzhi, Dai Yongren, Li Qin, Zhang Defa, Jin Zhuxin, Lin Qingquan, Jiang Bingzhi, and Zhenye, a total of ten people, were captured. At 17 Daxili Road, Disiwei Road, Lin Shen, Matsumoto Kano, Ozeki Toyojiro, Ishida Saburo, Wada Yukio, Hayashi Kokukatsu, Takeya Isamu, Noda Ichiro, Konakawa Zenichi, Kimura Kurazo, and Kito Matsuo, a total of eleven people, were captured. At 444 Fuxu Road, Xu Weili and Ge Yulin, two people, were captured. At 20, Lane 564, Fuxu Road, Shen Zhongqiang, one person, was captured. At 28 Shan Jili, Xinjialu Road, Zhu Yaozhang, one person, was captured. At 108 Yalu Road, Huang Yaodun, one person, was captured. The total number of people apprehended was 26.

Symbols and Communication Tools Seized

When arresting the criminals, various forged documents were seized from the residence of the main culprit, Miyarazhi. Among them were two wooden seals of the ÃÃ Seaboard Command of the Ãth Detachment of the Ãth Column of a certain war zone, nine letters of appointment, 68 "Dewei" symbols, a thick volume of condensed versions of the Asahi Shimbun, and a certificate issued by the puppet Manchurian government authorizing him to conduct espionage activities. From Lin Shen's residence, two Mauser rifles, 405 rounds of ammunition, five military telephones, two special wall telephones, six square shelves, one radio transmitter, a heap of radio transmitter parts, two boxes of gunpowder, three military swords, two binoculars, two cameras, six packages of super-adhesive agents of various sizes, a set of armor, thirty-six sets of military uniforms, one crowbar, and one steel helmet were seized. From Xu Weili's residence, six various pistols were seized. From Shen Zhongqiang's residence, eleven various pistols were seized.

Main Culprit Confesses to Secret Activities

According to the confession of the main culprit, Miyarazhi, during the interrogation at the military law office, he had previously served as the magistrate of Nong'an County in the puppet Manchuria, handling espionage work. Later, he was assigned to the puppet Manchuria Coal Mining Corporation to investigate the situation of laborers in Jinan, Wucheng, and En County. He also served as an advisor in the puppet "Military Affairs Committee of the National Government of Wang Jingwei" in northern Jiangsu, traveling to various places to carry out pacification and Japanese intelligence work for a year. He previously served as an advisor to the puppet Nanjing Daiwa Food Company, and purchased large quantities of rice and sugar under the name of the Shanghai puppet police bureau consumer cooperative, supplying them to the Japanese and puppets. After Japan surrendered, he posed as the Major General Deputy Commander of the Second Regiment of the Jingtai Security General Team of the Huainan Administrative Office of Jiangsu Province, and changed his name to Miyarazhi, responsible for underground work, which he did not deny. According to Lin Shen's confession, before the incident, he had opened a Reiyan Pharmaceutical Factory and jointly opened a Zhenya Pharmaceutical Factory in Shanghai. After the victory, he served as the "Commander of the Second Detachment of the Jingtai Security Column of the Huainan Administrative Office of Jiangsu Province" and was an old acquaintance of Miyarazhi. The remaining criminals were all Miyarazhi's followers and were appointed to various official titles of varying sizes by him.

### Taiwan Reconstruction Association Shanghai Branch Holds Inaugural Meeting

[Report from this Newspaper] The Preparatory Committee of the Taiwan Reconstruction Association Shanghai Branch held its inaugural meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. Approximately 150 to 160 people attended, including Yang Zhaojia, Ke Keshan, representatives from the municipal party headquarters and various sectors, and reporters from various newspapers.

At the Cairo Conference two years ago, our country made a clear decision to recover Taiwan. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the work of restoring Taiwan is extremely arduous, so people at home must work together wholeheartedly to assist the government in successfully accomplishing its mission. Ke Keshan then briefly described the resistance of our compatriots during the fifty years of occupation, and explained that the restoration of Taiwan must be divided into three stages: (1) recovery, (2) assisting the government in restoring Taiwan, and (3) constructing Taiwan. Representatives from the municipal party headquarters and various sectors then spoke in succession, believing that the new birth and reconstruction of Taiwan is not only the responsibility of the association but also the obligation of all citizens.

### U.S. Military Headquarters Eliminates Black Market Trade, Confiscates Military Medicines

[Report from this Newspaper] The U.S. Military Headquarters in this city announced yesterday that, in order to continue efforts to eliminate black market trade in Shanghai, its Criminal Investigation Division, in conjunction with the Municipal Police Department, confiscated military medicines stored in three pharmacies in the city on Thursday. The quantity of these medicines was not announced, but it included some penicillin, a small amount of sulfide agents, typhoid and cholera injections, and some vitamin pills.

The U.S. Military Investigation Division stated that it had long suspected that some pharmacies in the city were selling U.S. military drugs. After active investigation for a week, the most significant find was made this time. On New Year's Eve last year, a small amount of milk powder, coffee, sugar, oatmeal, white tower oil, and chocolate were seized, as well as military clothing. The department also raided a private residence and seized a large quantity of candies rationed to U.S. soldiers. They also seized a large amount of military food when searching a bar on Zhubao 3rd Road. The bar's license to allow U.S. soldiers to enter was revoked. Among the pharmacies searched on Thursday, the owner of one was arrested and will be further investigated.

The division also stated that no military personnel have been identified as being involved in the raids of the past week. However, twenty-five people, linked to black market transactions from the previous two months, will be tried and punished. Among the defendants, some are officers, who are accused of stealing government property, such as air force equipment, watches, aviation clocks, cameras, telescopes, clothing, and food, worth more than US$50,000. If found guilty, they could face five to ten years of imprisonment and will be discharged from the military.

The division also stated that, although there is currently no evidence of organized military participation in black market activities, individuals will still be severely punished. Military personnel who sell military supplies or public property after purchasing them will also be punished for illegally handling public property and promoting black market trade.

Therefore, the Procuratorate does not intend to close the registration yet. The enemy military police crime cases registered in November of last year were also submitted to the Garrison Headquarters yesterday, totaling more than 50 cases. Most of these cases involve murder, destruction of books, and property damage. These Japanese criminals will not be allowed to return to Japan but will remain in Shanghai pending trial. The scope of enemy crimes includes enemy nationals of Allied countries. Therefore, citizens can report other foreign crimes.

### Second Phase of Affordable Sugar Sales Begins Yesterday

The first batch of affordable oil is currently being held up due to customs procedures and will have to be postponed until around the 10th. As for the previously reported oil prices, they have now been revised, resulting in slight changes. Rapeseed oil will cost 125 yuan per shi jin, while soybean raw oil will cost 140 yuan per shi jin.

### Flags at Half-Mast on British and American Ships to Mourn Keynes

### Yesterday's Negotiations Fail to Yield Results; Labor Demands Fair Treatment

[Our Newspaper's Report] Workers at the American-owned Shanghai Power Company's Yangshupu Power Plant went on strike at approximately 5 PM the day before yesterday due to a dispute over treatment. This resulted in a power outage in several areas in western and northern Shanghai for over an hour, causing a loss of 20,000 watts of electricity. Upon hearing the news, the municipal Party, government, military, and police authorities dispatched personnel to mediate. The labor side accepted the advice and immediately resumed work. Labor and management held a meeting at the Social Bureau yesterday afternoon at 2 PM to discuss the matter.

Labor Demands Implementation of Agreement

The meeting began with informal discussions between worker representatives and Wang Xianqing, representing the municipal Party headquarters. Subsequently, Zhou Xuexiang, representing the General Labor Union; Chuan Shaowei, representing the Police Bureau; Cheng Yanren, representing the Shanghai Eastern District Investigation Office of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters; Zheng Xi, representing the Public Utilities Bureau; and Frederick, the vice president of the company, and Lu Gen, the personnel section chief, from the management side were in attendance. The labor side was represented by seven people from the Yangshupu Power Plant, four people from the Feilen Road Distribution Station, and four people from the Nanjing Road headquarters. Wang Xianqing chaired the meeting. The labor representatives presented their views and submitted a written copy of the ten articles of the agreement reached between both sides on September 29th of last year, demanding that the management immediately implement them and determine specific methods for doing so. These included: (1) Equal pay for equal work; (2) Improved welfare; (3) Wage adjustment; (4) Wage increase; (5) The ability to borrow 75% of pension funds in times of urgent need; (6) Changing the original 15-year pension period to 12 years; (7) Submission of revised pension regulations to the government for approval; (8) Labor representatives will report any former employees who took positions under the puppet regime and harmed the company, and the company will not re-employ them; (9) Issuance of wartime relief funds, which both sides agreed to retain; (10) The company authorities recognize Ouyang Zurun, Zhou Weixin, and seventeen others as representatives. Before formally beginning negotiations, Zhang Zhenyuan from the Social Bureau reported on the previous mediation efforts.

Wage Issue Remains Unresolved

Wang Xianqing then proceeded to discuss the issue of equal pay for equal work. Frederick from the management side stated that the company was gradually adjusting salaries, but there were many difficulties preventing rapid completion. Labor representatives cited facts regarding the unequal treatment of White Russians and Chinese workers. Frederick immediately stated that he would investigate and adjust accordingly. The discussion then turned to the wage issue. Frederick stated that base salaries had already been adjusted and that this had been met with criticism from various parties, so he would not agree to further adjustments. Zhang Zhenyuan from the Social Bureau raised several points regarding the wage issue, which Frederick responded to, but no concrete solution was reached. The atmosphere in the meeting became increasingly tense. Wang Xianqing proposed that the discussion continue next Monday afternoon at 2 PM.

Significant Salary Disparity Between Chinese and Foreign Employees

Reportedly, the current salaries of Chinese employees at the power company range from 30,000 to 40,000 yuan per month, accounting for 70% of the workforce; 20% earn between 40,000 and 70,000 yuan; and only 10% earn over 70,000 yuan. In contrast, foreign employees' salaries often range from 700,000 or 800,000 to over one million yuan. Therefore, although foreign employees account for only one-tenth of the total workforce, their salaries account for half of the company's total salary expenditure.

French Tram Company Also Submits Demands

The French Tram Company typically pays wages on the 5th of the month, but the company suddenly announced the other day that it would be delayed until the 7th and did not provide a concrete response to workers' demands for wage adjustments. Therefore, all employees are considering a work slowdown. Upon learning of this, the Social Bureau sent Zhang Zhenyuan to mediate. The company authorities agreed to raise funds to pay wages on schedule, but the labor side must adhere to the newly revised wage standards set by the Social Bureau on December 27th of last year and not make excessive demands. Yesterday afternoon, four labor representatives went to the Social Bureau to discuss other related matters. A work slowdown may not occur.

### Vaccinate Against Smallpox Immediately Upon Detection

[Our Newspaper's Report] Secretary Dai of the Bureau of Health informed reporters yesterday that smallpox is prevalent in the Yangtze River basin, including Jiujiang and Yichang. Two or three cases have also been discovered in the city, but there is no expanding trend. He hopes that citizens will get vaccinated as soon as possible to prevent infection.

### Strengthening Transportation of Relief Supplies; I Lease Ships from England; Relief Administration Says It Will Not Harm Shipping Rights

Regarding the Executive Yuan's Post-War Relief Administration's use of British ships to transport relief supplies, the Shanghai shipping industry believes that the Administration is transferring shipping rights, allowing British ships to operate in coastal ports and along the Yangtze River. The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Resources Committee has now decided to establish a Shanghai Machinery Factory in Shanghai. Its office has been selected on the third floor of the City Bank on Jiujiang Road. The factory will first establish the Second and Third Factories, which will be transferred from the enemy and puppet machine factories received by the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions. These include: (1) the Continental Machinery Factory on Gordon Road; (2) the Toyota Automobile Factory on Hejian Road; (3) the Changhe Manufacturing Plant on Tangshan Road. The Shanghai Machinery Factory is currently in the process of handover and will begin operations within days, initially manufacturing machine tools and automobile parts. The position of factory director has also been appointed to Bei Jiyao, the former director of the Central Machinery Factory in Kunming, Yunnan. Bei has already arrived in Shanghai and is beginning preparations for resuming work. They are in the process of signing a treaty to lease British merchant ships to transport relief supplies along China's coast and inland waterways, as the Joint Relief Agency will have an average of one relief ship arriving in China every day, each carrying 8,000 to 10,000 tons of supplies. This means that approximately 300,000 tons of relief supplies can be transported to China each month. To facilitate the rapid transfer of these supplies to various parts of the country and accelerate reconstruction, the decision was made to lease ships from the British government to strengthen transportation. The spokesperson also stated that they believe that signing this treaty will not harm China's sovereignty and will not hinder coastal and inland waterway transportation.

Sunken Ships Discovered Near Shandong

[Our Newspaper's Report] There are many obstacles in the Jianghai shipping lanes after the victory. Although the Allied mine-sweeping vessels have cleared most of them, Jiangping, a ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company captained by Shipmaster Ji Yu, reported that it discovered four sunken ships near Shandong Cape during its trip from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai. They are all located near 31 degrees north latitude and 112 degrees east longitude. Shipmasters should pay attention.

Strict Review of Ship Registration

The Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation has noted that among the ships applied for registration by various shipping companies, most belong to legitimate owners, but a few ships have unclear origins. Therefore, if the bureau discovers any ships that were owned by the enemy or puppet regime and are being claimed as one's own and applied for registration, they will be severely punished. As a result, the bureau is now extremely strict with the review conditions for registration documents.

### Warehouse Inventory Will Take Time

The Jianghai Customs' warehouse inventory work, which began on November 9th, has been underway for nearly two months. So far, over 700 warehouses have been inventoried. According to related parties, this task is expected to take another three months to complete. A large number of enemy and puppet warehouses have not yet been inventoried. The Customs will continue to carry out the inventory after the original receiving agency hands them over. The inventory of goods stored in Chinese-owned warehouses and silver and money industry warehouses has also begun. Items that are not owned by the enemy or puppet regime will be processed and returned.

### Industrial Association Requests Government Assistance for Industrial Revival

The National Industrial Association, in order to request the government's assistance in industrial revival, sent representatives to petition the central government, requesting assistance in the following areas: (1) Regarding the allocation of enemy and puppet factories, they expressed dissatisfaction with the current bidding method; (2) Requesting low-interest loans from the Central Bank; (3) Using Japanese reparations to assist factories in resuming operations; (4) Following the central government's example of exempting land taxes, exempting industrial products from taxation for one year; (5) Subsidizing technicians from the rear to come to Shanghai to resume work; (6) Assisting in transporting machinery from the rear to Shanghai. The central government agreed to consider the above six points in detail and then determine a method.

### Shanghai to Implement Legalized Prostitution to Regulate Public Morality

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the closure of massage parlors, escort agencies, and singing girl agencies in the city, which came into effect on New Year's Day, hundreds of people have directly faced unemployment, and indirectly affecting the livelihood of thousands of people. The authorities are currently drafting a plan to deal with the aftermath. It is rumored that the existence of legalized prostitution will be permitted in the short term in order to help a large number of prostitutes find alternative work. Director Bao of the First Division of the Police Bureau told reporters yesterday that the legalized prostitution system will be based on three principles: (1) Converting private into public, prohibiting the existence of private prostitutes, in order to facilitate management and inspection; (2) Consolidating scattered operations into organized operations, in order to delineate areas of vice; (3) Simplifying procedures, prohibiting the creation of various deceptive names for prostitution. Names must be unified, and businesses must display licenses to facilitate identification.

### Two Dance Halls Closed for Four Days

In addition to strictly enforcing the closure of escort agencies, massage parlors, and other disguised brothels, the city's police authorities have also restricted the operating hours of dance halls and stipulated that seating is not allowed on the dance floor. The other night, the Vienna and MGM dance halls on Xizang Road were fined and ordered to close for four days for violating the regulations and adding extra seats. It is rumored that each police precinct will send personnel at any time to investigate whether dance halls, cafes, and other establishments have violated regulations. Those with more serious violations will have their business licenses revoked.

### Holders of Belgian Currency and Stocks Should Register On Time

According to the Belgian Consulate General in Shanghai: (1) All holders of Belgian currency must register with the Belgian Consulate General at 1300 Fuxing Road, Shanghai, before January 31, 1946. (2) All holders of bonds and bearer stocks of Belgium or the Belgian Congo must register with the Sino-Belgian Bank in Shanghai before January 31, 1946. (3) In accordance with the laws promulgated by Belgium on October 6, 1944, and May 30, 1945, the above-mentioned currency, bonds, and stocks will be invalidated if the holder fails to register before the deadline. The public is advised to take note.

### Winter Relief Association Focuses on Vocational Training

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Winter Relief Association held a reception for newspaper reporters at 2:30 PM yesterday, at which Feng Zhifang, representing the Association, reported on the progress of the work. It was stated that seven shelters have now been selected: (1) The Qingjietang Shelter, which has already begun to take in 504 refugees; (2) The Charity Association Joint Committee, which can accommodate approximately 500 people; (3) The Catholic Charity Association on Mackenzie Road; (4) The Mackenzie Road Shelter, which is currently repairing houses and is expected to begin taking in people around the 10th; (5) The Lujiabang Shelter, where temporary sheds are being built on vacant land; (6) The Zhabei Charity Association; (7) The Caohejing Shelter, whose houses have been approved by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau for unsealing and allocation, with the capacity to accommodate approximately 1,000 people. The goal is to accommodate a total of 3,000 people. The methods for taking in people are: one, self-referral, but subject to review; and two, street collection. All refugees admitted to the shelters are subject to strict management and are not allowed to enter or leave freely without permission, in order to prevent abuses.

Food and Supplies

The Post-War Relief Administration has agreed to supply 3,000 bags of flour and 3,000 sets of clothing per month, as well as beds. It will also be able to purchase 30 tons of coal from the Administration at a price of 30,000 yuan per ton. However, the Administration will not provide medical supplies. The total cost is 100 million yuan, which depends entirely on the enthusiastic donations of caring individuals.

Donations have been entrusted to various newspapers and major banks for collection, and the names of donors will be publicly announced daily to ensure transparency. Administrative expenses will be paid by the municipal government, so even the smallest donation will be used for the refugees, in line with the relief objectives. It is rumored that the Association's management will focus on education and vocational training, and will introduce work to those who pass the assessment, such as street cleaners and laborers, so that they can become productive members of society in the future, thus making the meaning of relief work more proactive.

Another Batch of Japanese Residents and Prisoners of War in Shanghai Sent Away; Deportation to be Completed Within Nine Months

The fourth batch of ships carrying Japanese residents and prisoners of war back to their country set sail for Japan yesterday afternoon. There were a total of four ships, including three landing craft and one small transport ship. According to the Shanghai Port Transportation Command, the four ships carried a total of 3,339 Japanese residents and prisoners of war. All of these residents and prisoners of war completed their inspection the day before yesterday. They boarded the ships yesterday morning and departed at 2 PM. It is reported that landing craft will be regularly dispatched in rotation to send them back to Japan. It is estimated that the more than 700,000 Japanese residents and prisoners of war remaining in Shanghai will be deported within nine months.

Naval Prisoners of War to be Taken Over Within Days

The Shanghai Office of the Naval Headquarters has been ordered to close, and personnel from the Naval Department of the Ministry of Military Administration will take over. The Japanese naval prisoners of war in Shanghai, which it was originally responsible for, will also be taken over by the Shanghai Japanese Resident and Prisoner of War Management Office, under orders. It has been found that there are two Japanese naval concentration camps in the Shanghai area, one on Fuxing Island and one in Pudong. The Fuxing Island camp was originally scheduled to be taken over by the Management Office today, but because today is Sunday, the transfer has been changed to tomorrow. The Pudong camp currently has 3,490 former Japanese naval marines, 211 former members of the Shanghai base headquarters, and 338 people concentrated from various Japanese warships, for a total of 4,039 people. Yesterday afternoon, Deputy Director Zhou Ren of the Management Office took a special ship to inspect the camp. Katsuno Minoru, the former commander of the Shanghai Marines, who was sentenced to two months in prison for concealing the criminals in the shooting of the American soldiers and failing to report it, was recently released from prison on December 21st of last year. Upon learning that Zhou's group was coming to inspect the camp, he led the team to the riverbank to welcome them. Zhou inquired in detail about the current situation of the camp and gave instructions to Katsuno Minoru and others, explaining the future management and educational policies and setting a date for the takeover within days. Finally, he inspected the entire camp. Because the houses in the camp are relatively few, many of the Japanese naval prisoners of war are living in tents. The internal equipment is better than that of the Japanese army prisoners of war. In addition to a portion of the prisoners of war being assigned to perform labor, some are staying in tents, operating sewing machines, and doing work such as knitting wool, just like women doing needlework. However, most of them have packed their luggage and are waiting to be sent home.

### Futian Village Robbery; One Thief is a Playwright; Dr. Zhan Nianceng's House Robbed

[Our Newspaper's Report] The house of Hu Yizhou, an old Wenzhou man who runs the Kenengdeng Hotel, located at 53 Futian Village, Beijing West Road, in the jurisdiction of the Lujiawan Police Precinct, was visited by four robbers on the first day of the month at around 4 PM. Two gold rings were stolen, and the robbers fled. Two hours later, the precinct intercepted a pedestrian at a certain location and found two pistols and several bullets on him. The suspect, identified as Xu Wenhua, a 21-year-old from Wujin, confessed to robbing Hu's house in Futian Village and revealed that his accomplices were hiding at 271 Jiale Road. Police officers were immediately dispatched to arrest Zhao Xiaobao and two others and confiscate one Mauser pistol and seven bullets. Zhao confessed that a man named Liu living at 2 Ganshidong Road had firearms in his possession. Police officers were dispatched to the house, but Liu had already fled after hearing the news. A revolver was found in the residence, and a man named Wang was arrested. Based on Wang's confession, the police learned of other hideouts. Chief Zhao, Deputy Chief Li, Section Chief Jin, staff member Sun Dafa, patrol officer Qin Boliang, Xue Minjie, police officers Jin Zhimin, Gao Xiancai, and Xu Jinan led a large number of armed officers to the Runhua Hotel on Fuzhou Road, the upstairs of the Dafang Leather Shoe Store on Ximen Road, and 39 Pishao Nai Road, where they arrested four more suspects.

After preliminary interrogation, they were sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for punishment.

The house of Dr. Zhan Nianceng, a Western medicine practitioner, located at 15 Yongnian Lane, 1265 Zhongzheng East Road, was visited by three robbers at around 5:30 PM yesterday. The robbers stole over 200,000 yuan in legal tender, one diamond ring, one gold bracelet, one gold watch, one anklet, and other men's and women's leather coats and valuables worth over 2 million yuan.

Police Bureau Orders Reconstruction of Lane Signs

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the past, during the era of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the house numbers of residents in each lane were arranged on wooden signs at the entrance of the lane. Now, due to the passage of time, some lane signs are incomplete. The Police Bureau has now ordered the reconstruction of lane signs, with residents of each lane raising funds to customize them. Each sign is 60 inches high and 10 inches wide, with the lane name plate 3 inches high. Each police precinct has been ordered to implement this, with completion scheduled by the 20th of the month. Other signs will also be updated at the same time to create a new look.

### Water Shortage in Shanghai Suburbs Not Reduced

Recently, the water supply to residences with tap water in the suburbs of Shanghai, especially those above the second floor, has been constantly cut off, causing great inconvenience to residents. Reporters inquired with the water company. According to a senior employee of the company, during the enemy and puppet period, the supply of tap water was restricted due to insufficient coal. Therefore, the general public also restricted their usage, so the water shortage was not too great. However, after the victory of the war, citizens took a laissez-faire attitude towards water usage, while the company's facilities have not yet been restored, and damaged machinery has not yet been completely repaired. Users in the urban area above the second floor have reported water cuts, and those farther away have no water at all. The company is well aware of the difficulties and is actively stepping up repairs. It is expected that the supply will be restored soon.

### Twenty-Nine Prisoners Executed, Only One Left Alive: Yang Wendao, Wrongfully Accused, Hopes for Early Release

â Our Reporter, Ping Qi

Yang Wendao, implicated in the Zhongshan Hideo blood case ten years ago and wrongly convicted and sentenced to death, has recently appealed for a retrial to overturn the unjust verdict, arousing widespread public sympathy and a sense of justice. Following our presentation of this "prisoner's" tearful story to our readers the day before yesterday, today we record the details of our visit with Yang Wendao in prison:

Inhumanity in Every Word, Tears in Every Sentence

Located within the grim, gray, high walls of the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison, it feels like stepping into a "city of the dead," where even breathing seems difficult. The corridors are lined with heavy iron doors, and prison guards walk silently back and forth. We waited in a bare room for Yang Wendao, who had been under a death sentence for ten years.

Suddenly, the sharp, cold sound of keys rang out, and the iron door was pulled open. Several bailiffs escorted a man out. He was wearing a gray cotton prison uniform and trousers. He was short in stature, with a sallow and aged complexion. The top of his head was already bald, but the eyes of this man, weathered by suffering, were full of excitement.

A bailiff said loudly to me, "This is Yang Wendao!"

For ten years, only his son, Hanzhi, had been able to visit him weekly, speaking for three to five minutes through the iron bars. This time, as a reporter meeting him, perhaps for the first time he was hearing the voice of someone who sympathized with him. He said excitedly, "I was kidnapped like baggage by Japanese detectives from the police station on April 19th of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic, and imprisoned on Dixui Road. Every day at twelve o'clock, they would hang me in the special room of the Fourth Avenue Police Station for torture. They would blindfold me, tie me to a tiger bench, and pour cold water into my nostrils, demanding that I confess I was following government orders as an assassin, specifically to assassinate Japanese. They stripped me naked and forced me to kneel on two sharp small stones, with my upper body held perfectly straight... Oh God, my knees were ruined!"

Misfortunes Never Come Singly, Everything Burned to the Ground

For over six months, until he was sentenced to death on October 2nd, he endured daily beatings and abuse. After the sentencing, he was transferred to Tilanqiao, where he became a "death row inmate" awaiting execution.

His body was covered in wounds and he was shackled. Each day, he was only allowed to walk three circles in the prison yard and was forbidden to leave his cell. Despite his grievances, he was not allowed to speak here.

His home was on Tangshan Road, very close to the prison, yet it seemed so far away to him. During the "August 13th Incident," the fierce artillery fire left the iron walls of Tilanqiao Prison unscathed, but his home on Tangshan Road was burned to the ground. The Japanese had occupied Shanghai.

Thirty death row inmates were housed on the fifth floor of the prison's "RD" building. From time to time, groups of two or three were taken away for execution in large trucks. In the bitter winter, Hanzhi would rush to the Nanshi execution ground before dawn to wait. Every time he saw a large truck coming from Tilanqiao, he would carefully search, his heart aching. For over ten days, from eight in the morning to three in the afternoon, his father was not among them.

Thirty Prisoners, One Left Alive

Yang Wendao waited as his fellow inmates were taken away one by one, until only two remained. One morning, the "Number Twenty-Nine" prisoner suddenly received wine. His time had come. Yang Wendao drank heavily with him. "Number Twenty-Nine" was taken away on the "big truck" that day. Now, only Yang Wendao remained.

Yet Yang Wendao was never called. The truth was that the prison authorities knew he was innocent, so they did not reveal his case file when the Japanese occupied Shanghai.

Outside the iron window, the setting sun cast a faint light. A line of prisoners in gray cotton coats walked past silently. Yang Wendao, with tears in his eyes, said, "Ten years of suffering. Heaven has blessed me with a chance for redress. I want nothing else. I only hope to see my children soonâI only hope to go home soon."

### Expansion of Jielu Road and Zhejiang Road: Municipal Government Orders Demolition of Houses by Year-End, with Owners Responsible for Demolition Costs

(Report from this Newspaper) The Municipal Government considers Jielu Road and Zhejiang Road, located near the North Railway Station, to be crucial transportation arteries. However, the road surfaces are too narrow, causing significant inconvenience for vehicular traffic. A decision has been made to widen Jielu Road to 30 meters and Zhejiang Road to 20 meters. Regarding the widening of Zhejiang Road, it is reported that the authorities are considering starting with the sections north of Suzhou Creek and south of Fuzhou Road. Our reporter has learned from the Municipal Government that houses obstructing the widening of these two roads must be demolished by the end of the thirty-fifth year of the Republic, with the property owners responsible for the demolition costs and the police department providing supervision. It is also reported that after the widening of these two roads, the property owners along the roads will benefit from the improved transportation, and the Finance Bureau will collect corresponding fees from them. As for compensation for property losses incurred by the public due to the road widening, the Municipal Government has not yet decided on a compensation plan.

Extending North Xizang Road

The streets and roads in the Huangpu District of this city are congested with traffic, causing difficulties. In addition to actively repairing damaged road surfaces, the bureau is starting to widen Jielu Road and Paoma Road. It is also reported that plans are underway to extend North Xizang Road to connect with Song Park Road, to facilitate transportation from the Northeast to Jielu Road and directly to the North Railway Station, benefiting transportation between the railway station and western Shanghai.

Movies and Theater

### Welcoming the China Electric Drama Troupe

â Li Lin

At a time when Shanghai's theater scene is trending towards a low ebb, the news that the China Electric Drama Troupe has set off east from Chongqing is like a stimulant for us. It brings us new strength and hope, just like a fresh force arriving when the situation is critical.

Undeniably, Shanghai's theater world is facing an unprecedented crisis. Foreign films are taking away many of our audiences and theaters. However, this crisis is not irremediable. After four years of absence, foreign films naturally have a unique, bewitching appeal, but this is ultimately a temporary phenomenon. Once the audience's fervor for foreign films subsides somewhat, spoken drama may still be able to rise again. The appeal of foreign films is not irresistible; it depends on our efforts. Movies and theater each have their irreducible advantages, and they both have a reason to exist because of their unique qualities. The recent prosperity of the only three remaining spoken drama theaters in Shanghai is good proof of this. However, fierce competition is unavoidable. The reason the three remaining spoken drama theaters can compete with movie theaters is because of the excellence of their chosen plays and the strength of their cast. Therefore, in the future, we only need to focus on improving the standard of performance, and spoken drama is not without a future. As for the theater panic, it is only a temporary phenomenon. Merchants are short-sighted and only interested in profit. Once our audience returns to our theaters and spoken drama business equals or even exceeds that of movies, theaters will not be a problem.

The problem before us is how to improve our performance standards. In the commercialized Shanghai theater scene, due to the continuous increase in theatrical troupes, reaching as many as twelve during the peak, the quality of actors has greatly decreased, manpower has been dispersed, and work attitudes have become less serious. Therefore, when faced with a strong rival like foreign films, we feel a great threat. Therefore, we must currently focus on improving our performance standards and improving our work attitude.

We have long heard of the China Electric Drama Troupe's great reputation in Chongqing. Not only is the selection of plays extremely careful, but the cast is also very well-organized. Most valuable is the strong academic atmosphere that permeates the troupe. They maintain a serious work style. In addition, the troupe's leader, Mr. Zhang Junxiang, is a rare all-around talent in the country. This is truly a powerful new force for Shanghai's future theater scene.

The plays that "China Electric" has performed in Chongqing include: "Model Teacher for All Ages," "Return of Spring to the Earth," "Song of Righteousness," "Mountain City Story," and "Golden Jade Full House." The characteristic of their performances is that they emphasize the average development of actors, do not rely on one or two famous actors as a selling point, and pay special attention to cooperation between actors. Their actors are very average in terms of acting skills, and their quality is very excellent, unlike the unevenness of ordinary troupes.

I heard that the members of "China Electric" are traveling by car to Yuanling, then transferring to Changsha, passing through Hankou, and heading east along the Yangtze River. They have already passed Changsha; they should arrive in Shanghai within about a week. At the same time, Mr. Zhang Junxiang arrived in Shanghai a month earlier to prepare for the performances and recruit outstanding talents to join "China Electric." In this way, the lineup of "China Electric" will be even stronger. I eagerly hope to see the performances of "China Electric" soon, to satisfy our thirst.

Before "China Electric" arrives in Shanghai, I would like to express our warm welcome and hope that "China Electric" is not only our new force but also our role model, forming a strong front with us to rescue Shanghai's current theater crisis.

### Reminiscing About Chongqing

â Sha Tong

Chongqing is a mountain city protruding between the Yangtze River and the Jialing River. It rarely sees the sun throughout the year, and walking requires climbing hills. The lives of theater and film people are as difficult as those of ordinary civil servants. Therefore, when victory came, everyone wanted to go east quickly. However, I was one of the first reporters to come down, but I also miss Chongqing the most. I lived in Chongqing for eight years, which can be said to be eight years of hard struggle. We not only forged a new way of life, but also forged a new way of working. For example, during the Great Bombing and the so-called continuous fatigue bombing, we not only had to hide in air-raid shelters, but also had to learn rescue work, protect equipment, shoot newsreels, and use the time spent in air-raid shelters to read scripts. For example, when prices were high and resources were not enough to distribute, how did everyone organize and manage food groups? We not only had to buy vegetables ourselves but also grow vegetables and even raise pigs. This kind of life was hard enough, but when you think back to it, it was really flavorful.

Chongqing had very few entertainment and leisure places. Frankly speaking, even if there were, theater and film people like us could not afford to go. Therefore, the small teahouse near the film studio became the club for film and theater people. There, three or five people sat at a table, and there were even reclining chairs. Some rested, some read scripts, some held meetings to discuss performance methods, some wrote articles, and some even met guests there. When hungry, they could order a few bowls of "dandan noodles" to eat. "Dandan noodles" are a specialty of Sichuan, both economical and delicious. Xie Tian could eat five or six bowls in a row. The architecture of this kind of teahouse was naturally very simple. Maybe it was just a grass shed built with bamboo mats under the shade of a big yellow tree, or a dilapidated old house. However, female stars such as Bai Yang were frequent guests. Therefore, Chongqing movie fans who wanted to admire female stars only needed to frequent the small teahouses near the film studio or across from the Cathay Grand Theater, and they could always achieve their goal. However, the words "female star" were not noticeable in Chongqing because they themselves were very ordinary, as plain as an ordinary female student.

I said that walking in Chongqing requires climbing hills. Some people say that crossing a river is like swinging on a swing. Going down a slope and then up another, isn't that swinging on a swing? Those mountain cities were not the stairs of Western-style houses, so they were naturally uneven. Therefore, the ladies and wives living in Chongqing rarely wore high heels. We could see female stars wearing boots, but we didn't see them wearing high heels. Therefore, the actors playing modern women in several plays were not used to the gait of high heels.

During the bombing period, filming work was really impossible to promote. Chongqing in the summer certainly had the sun, but it was also good weather for bombing. Because of the bombing, the supply of electricity and light became a problem. The fog season was certainly not afraid of bombing, but it lacked the sun, and the supply of electricity was still not ideal. Therefore, the lagging behind of film production was inevitable. On the contrary, spoken drama made great progress. During the bombing period, plays were rehearsed, and once the fog season arrived, each troupe became active in the mountain city at the same time.

Although living in a situation where all material conditions were difficult, the film and theater people of Chongqing were able to live and work more strongly. Therefore, I miss Chongqing very much.

### The Fatal Wound of Spoken DramaâLack of Venues

â Jun Yi

In the past month, many spoken drama workers have rushed from the mainland, but they are still wandering aimlessly, with nothing to do, becoming "heroes with no place to use their skills." The lack of venues has formed the most serious problem in the current spoken drama industry. Before peace, there were more than ten spoken drama theaters in the city, but currently, they have gradually decreased to only three. Speaking honestly, most of those who "make a living from spoken drama" in Shanghai in recent years have been able to work hard in their positions and have managed to grasp a large customer base. Now that victory has come, they have lost their original positions!

In the mainland, spoken drama is inseparable from the public, and similarly, the public cannot leave spoken drama. During the War of Resistance, it has tried its best to exert the power of spoken drama itself, and therefore it has also attracted the attention of the authorities. Many scripts have won the government's awards, and many workers have also received the help of manpower and material resources that the wartime government cherished. Therefore, a few days ago, I met a spoken drama worker from the mainland. When he arrived in Shanghai, he was surprised why spoken drama here has remained so neglected for so many years. On the contrary, local operas seem to have made significant progress. In fact, this gentleman is suffering from nearsightedness. Has he ever seen the booming scene four or five months ago!

Due to the gradual opening of Western film sources, cinema merchants have discovered that running spoken drama is not only too troublesome but also does not have the lucrative interest of screening movies. They mercilessly kicked out that group of spoken drama groups, even though they knew that these workers had also contributed their efforts and made them rich. It's really like what Mr. Li Jianwu said: "So we fall into the utilitarian hearts of these merchants"! In fact, these cinema merchants are also suffering from nearsightedness. In the situation where our own domestic films cannot be produced in large quantities for a while, is there any guarantee that these Western films will not make the audience sick in the future? In the bags of a group of mainland playwrights in Shanghai, there are rich treasures. Why don't the merchants here take out the keys to open them for them?

Two months ago, I heard that several theaters received from the enemy and puppet sides were prepared to be supplied to personnel returning from the mainland, and a public theater management committee has been established. This is indeed a great piece of good news in the venue shortage. I hope that the past Shanghai spoken drama teams can cooperate with each other. They will definitely produce a brilliant future, and millions of spoken drama audiences may as well wait and see!

### "Laments of the Late Ming Dynasty"

Yesterday at noon, there was a gathering at the Kangle Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road. Jiang Bocheng, Wu Kaixian, Wan Molin, and others hosted a banquet for famous figures from the spoken drama and Peking opera circles, as well as important central party and government officials, to raise funds for the Shanghai Municipal Association for Comrades Who Suffered Hardships and the preparations for public performances of spoken drama and Peking opera. Niu Yongjian, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Xiaolai, and Mei Lanfang, Zhou Xinfang, Zhang Junxiang, Gu Zhongyi, Fei Mu, Xu Suling, and others attended to discuss preparations for theatrical performances to raise funds. Mrs. Jiang Bocheng was enthusiastic about planning and was quite active. The play list and performance methods were decided at the time. Zhou Xinfang immediately agreed to perform famous plays such as Laments of the Late Ming Dynasty. The spoken drama circle also decided that each troupe would participate in the performance separately. If the "China Electric" troupe could catch up, they would participate with "Model Teacher for All Ages." At that time, Shanghai theater fans will be able to feast their eyes.

### Short Film Reviews

â Lai Ming

Recently, Hollywood films have been arriving in Shanghai in a steady stream, making every movie fan feel very excited. However, according to letters from the mainland, especially the Hollywood films screened in the wartime capital were the most. However, most of the films screened in Shanghai were screened in the wartime capital. In recent days, there are several ten films in Shanghai that can be introduced.

1.  National Soul

Is a worthwhile introduction of a good film; The heroine of this film is Irene Dunne, and the hero is Alan Marshall. The whole plot uses a flashback method to narrate an elderly British nurse in an American military hospital, recalling her husband. After he was born in London, she took her beloved son and lived far away in the United States; Later, when her son grew up, the Second World War broke out, so she dedicated her son to the country with loyalty and bravery, and joined the hospital to serve. The whole purpose of the film is a great era of motherhood. Irene Dunne's acting skills are also quite accomplished, and this film is worth a look for the motherhood in our country.

2.  Dream Quest

Is a French people, in the occupied area, the history of patriotic enthusiasm, the protagonist of this film, is Humphrey Bogart, who has given us a very deep image in "The Tiger General of the Lonely City", and of course has better acting skills in this film. This film also uses a flashback method to narrate the plot; The beginning of the story is that Captain Sinna (Claude Rains) of the Free French Air Force at the British base narrates to a reporter about the origins of the members of the squadron.

Malek (Humphrey Bogart) and four other French youths escaped from prison and fled overseas; After a fierce battle on a giant ship, they finally reached England peacefully, and then joined the Free French Air Force to serve the motherland. In the end, Malek was moved to tears by the audience in the scene where he died in a brave air battle, and the film was fought by our people.

3.  Peach Blossom Palace

Fred Astaire, Rita Hayworth, these two Hollywood stars, especially Fred is the Hollywood dance emperor, his funny face and brisk steps; Made every audience praised; Rita Hayworth's enchanting beauty in the past "Blood and Sand" has fascinated many movie fans. In this film, Rita plays the daughter of a wealthy merchant. She suddenly receives a letter from an anonymous youth every day, and in the end, those letters are written by her father, causing a burst of laughter. Fred plays an unemployed dancer who unintentionally falls in love with the daughter of a wealthy merchant and becomes husband and wife. The new songs and dances in this film are particularly outstanding, so this film is just a song and dance comedy.

4.  Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves

Since the film Savage Girl was screened in Shanghai, it has caused a sensation among audiences throughout Shanghai. The protagonist of this film is the same as Savage Girl, the heroine is Maria Montez, and the hero is Jon Hall. After the war, major Hollywood film companies were recruiting troops, and Universal Pictures was the best. Among the discoveries of new stars, Maria Montez was the most popular, and Jon Hall's acting skills in the past "Stormy Wedding" and "Mermaid" were quite sophisticated. His brown skin and tall body are really worthy of playing the leading role of Ali Baba.

The whole film tells the story of a Baghdad prince in Asia Minor who was reduced to Ali Baba among the Forty Thieves by a traitorous courtier; Ten years later, Alian was twenty years old and determined to take revenge. After many difficulties, he avenged the unshared hatred; Among them, the scene where Ali Baba shouted to open the mountain gate was particularly moving; In addition to Maria Montez and Jon Hall, Don Buke's role as Dane Mick is also quite accomplished. This film is a masterpiece with the same effect as "Box in the Moon Palace".

### History of the Invention of Film

Film is really a friend that we are too familiar with, but few people know its origin, and even fewer remember its birthday. The general public always thinks that its origin is the United States, but in fact, it was born in France exactly fifty years ago. The first person to invent the film died in poverty and became an unsung hero. The successful inventor was still alive twelve years ago. From the success of the experiment to the present, it has been through fifty years, "black and white" to "color", "silent" to "talking" and many other reforms to have today. In the near future, there may be "three-dimensional" "smell" and "wireless transmission of "see the shadow and hear the sound" and other developments. Wednesday, December 26th of this year, happens to be the 50th anniversary of the successful invention of film. Film merchants and old theater operators who have benefited from films seem to should express something at that time.

### Regarding "Lili Grass"

â Qiushui

This is a story written by a playwright: In Northeast China, in 1932, when Japanese armed immigrants arrived in a certain small town, they forcibly occupied the house of Ma Shun and Su Jia. They killed two people accused of being guerrillas, while constantly fearing attacks from the guerrillas. A man named Kuroda, the head of the immigration unit, once captured the guerrilla commander, Climbing Tiger Zhang Wenxi. He wanted Ma Shun to identify whether he was real or fake. Ma Shun took the opportunity to release Climbing Tiger. Consequently, a Korean man named Cui Daji was found guilty by Kuroda and shot dead.

The next day, the execution was scheduled for Ma Shun, Su Jia, and Cui Chengfu. At night, they set fire as a signal. The guerrillas stormed in and rescued them, but Cui Chengfu had already been shot dead by the Japanese.

The lives of the people in Lili Grass are one of suffering and oppression, but also of struggle. The lives of the people in Lili Grass are the real lives of our compatriots in Northeast China. Now that the Northeast has returned to our embrace, recalling the past is like waking from a nightmare. Indeed, it is still worth seeing how unfortunate our nation was in the past, how suffocated our people were, so that we can now cherish and strengthen ourselves.

Fengzi's Su Jia is a new woman. She is young, but the atmosphere seems to have aged her several years. Mu Hong's Ma Shun is passable. Qiao Qi's Kuroda portrays his cunning and insidiousness, and even his small movements are vividly depicted. In terms of acting, this is one of the most satisfying performances.

The actress playing "âMeâ," Zai Yi, is said to be a "remarkable person." However, this newcomer reveals her rawness in her acting. She fails to demonstrate her ability and remarkable qualities. In the final scene, she directs what to do and how to do it, but her voice sounds almost like a broken record. However, judging from her efforts and seriousness, she might be a promising figure.

The first few scenes pass in a dull atmosphere, but there is a change at the beginning of the last scene. However, after the appearance of the thief, the atmosphere of the "civilized drama" is too strong. Although the intention is to change the atmosphere, this move may be a flaw.

### Hollywood Film Stars Return Home

â Yingdai

Back on the Silver Screen to Start New Films

Most of the film personnel who joined the military have now been demobilized and have returned to the United States first, to resume their lives under the mercury lights of Hollywood. We can list a few below.

(1) Tyrone Power, 30 years old, served as a Navy lieutenant in the war against Japan and returned to Hollywood in early December. His wife, Annabella, was filming "Wings of the Morning." She welcomed him at the landing site in Pat Roland with an embrace and a passionate kiss, a scene rarely seen on screen.

### Random Thoughts

â Moyan

There have been many reports and discussions about the issue of soldiers watching free plays for the past two weeks, and the incidents and disputes caused by them have also been dealt with by the military and political authorities in the city. Perhaps a solution will be formulated soon, but I am afraid that the "solution" may not be considered a resolution to the problem, because it includes several fundamental issues such as soldier's treatment, garrison jurisdiction, and theater ticket prices, which no one can immediately resolve completely. We only hope that the situation can gradually improve. Maybe in ten or twenty years, this problem will no longer exist. Speaking of this kind of problem and the Qing Xiong (brash behavior) it reveals, it is precisely to create a spiritual boundary between the military and civilians, and for the "military" to forever have an unpleasant "eye-catching" feeling. As for whether the incidents that occur in various theaters in Shanghai are detrimental to international perceptions, it goes without saying. Therefore, the theaters only suffer limited losses, and the ultimate responsibility still falls on our Republic of China?

### Municipal Suggestion: The Racecourse Should be Converted into a Sports Field

â Luo Ziqiang

After the racecourse was taken over, it was sublet to the American military authorities. Is it because this large open space cannot be used?

Look at the Bund Park, which is crowded every morning with citizens who are striving for self-improvement, stretching their fists and legs. Shanghai has more than four million people who work in a crowded environment all day long, depriving them of outdoor activities, most of whom are physically weak and prone to illness.

The racecourse is located in the center of the city, with an open space and convenient transportation, making it very suitable to be developed into a public sports field, so that citizens can adjust their mental and physical fatigue and exercise their bodies. It is hoped that the authorities will take it back for their own use. After taking it back, the surroundings can be planted with flowers to isolate the noise. The outer ring can still be the race track, and another ring can be opened as a pedestrian path for citizens to run. The area in the middle of the field can be divided into several sections, with some sections being football fields, steel ball fields, basketball fields, and some sections being Tai Chi fields, wrestling fields, boxing fields, and other martial arts mechanical exercises, even somersaults, etc., hiring famous teachers to teach, in order to awaken the martial spirit of our compatriots and break free from the stigma of the "Sick Man of East Asia."

A strong country must first have strong people, and the wise authorities will surely have a high vision. Furthermore, the quality of our country's army is very weak, which may be due to the neglect of training on weekdays. Although the Japanese invaders have surrendered, the spirit of their daily training during their occupation is worthy of our military and political leaders to adopt this method, and it will surely have a great effect.

### Crack Down on Prostitution Solicitors and Streetwalkers: Do Not Neglect Small Matters

It is reported that the Municipal Police Department will crack down on all escort agencies and massage parlors that are disguised brothels from New Year's Day, which is a wise move. From now on, many people can be rescued and spared from falling into the sea of ââsuffering again, which is really meritorious. However, there is still a very small matter that I hope the wise authorities will pay attention to, that is, in the area of ââthe Dashin Company gate on Nanjing Road, every afternoon, before two or three o'clock, there will be a group of streetwalkers who are considered to be the lowest, soliciting business there. Foreign soldiers are their target, and they do not hesitate to use any ugly state to curry favor. Because I often pass by there, I always see it, and I am often angry. I feel that we are now a first-class power, and in this so-called world metropolis of Shanghai, and especially in the most bustling area, there is such an embarrassing thing happening, which is detrimental to the image and is a great loss to national prestige. Please ask the competent authorities to immediately crack down on it. Do not neglect it because it is a small matter. This is a major matter related to the reputation of the entire country.

### A Message to the Guangdong Compatriots in Shanghai: Quickly Redress the Wrongful Conviction of Yang Wendao

â Zhen Kai

We know that our country's judiciary is independent, but the handling of legal cases should never be stylized, like Yang Wendao, the "central figure in the shocking news of the international blood case" that once shocked the world. The Judicial Affairs Bureau seems to resolve the case as soon as possible. Moreover, Yang Wendao suffered severe torture, but he was still unwilling to be used by the enemy Japanese. Yang Wendao truly deserves to be a "hard man who would rather sacrifice his life than be used by the Japanese invaders." Just talking about the matter, after the unconditional surrender of the brutal Japanese and the victory of our War of Resistance, allowing Yang Wendao to be honorably released from prison and receive the support of the masses is not an extremely honorable thing?
