### Marshal Ma Arrives at Kuling with Song President
### Rumored to Carry Letter from Zhou Enlai to the Chairman
### Lushan Talk Conference to Open Next Month

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] Marshal Ma left his residence on Ninghai Road around 2:00 PM on the 15th to fly by special plane to Xunyang four times before heading to Kuling. The date of his descent will depend on the needs of the KMT-CCP negotiation environment. The Xunyang Ertoukou Airport has been flooded for days, preventing aircraft from landing. According to news from Jiujiang this afternoon, the water has not receded, yet Marshal Ma risked flying there. It is rumored that Marshal Ma is carrying a letter from Zhou Enlai to Chairman Chiang, which is believed to contain the CCP's response to the Chairman's message. It is also learned that Marshal Ma originally planned to return to his country earlier, but after the joint statement was issued, both the KMT and the CCP expressed their willingness to continue negotiations to resolve political issues. Therefore, Marshal Ma no longer plans to return home early. It is rumored that the US Senate has repeatedly hoped for Marshal Ma's return, as it is generally believed that Marshal Ma's peace mediation in China is hopeless. However, most senators deeply hope that Marshal Ma can personally return home to provide a responsible report to the Senate and redefine their policy. However, Marshal Ma personally understands the current situation in our country and consistently believes that the door to peaceful negotiation has not been closed, so he has decided to make a final effort and not return home for the time being.

[Our Kuling Dispatch, 15th] Marshal Marshall, accompanied by President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, and his staff and secretaries, arrived in Kuling together at 6:30 PM on the 15th. Marshal Ma's wife personally went to Xiaotianchi to greet Marshal Ma. When passing through Kuling Street, some children who knew Marshal Ma surrounded him and cheered with his entourage. Marshal Ma responded with a kind smile. Marshal Ma then returned to his residence at No. 40 Hexi Road to rest. President Song went directly to pay respects to the Chairman after arriving, talking for about an hour. Mrs. Chiang sent him off to the Song family's residence at No. 3. It is said that Mr. Song will go down the mountain and return to Nanjing tomorrow.

[Central News Agency, Kuling Dispatch, 15th] President Song told reporters who greeted him before entering Kuling Street on the 15th that he had agreed with the Chairman during his last departure from Kuling to report on the political situation every two weeks. This visit is to fulfill that promise. He is unaware of rumors that the government will convene the Lushan Talk Conference.

[Central News Agency, Kuling Dispatch, 15th] President Song told reporters who greeted him before entering Kuling Street on the 15th that he had agreed with the Chairman during his last departure from Kuling to report on the political situation every two weeks. This visit is to fulfill that promise. He is unaware of rumors that the government will convene the Lushan Talk Conference for the National Assembly to discuss and make a choice, in order to create a sound and feasible constitution. The main purpose of the talk conference that the Chairman will convene in Kuling, involving the heads of universities, speakers of provincial and municipal councils, and other parties, is to exchange opinions. It is believed that representatives of all parties will come here to participate, provide opinions, and create a sound and feasible draft constitution, so that the National Assembly can be held as scheduled. It is said that this talk conference will open around September 20th, before the Political Consultative Conference on October 10th, and will last for about a week.

[Central News Agency, Kuling Dispatch, 15th] Zeng Qi, Chairman of the China Youth Party, and Liu Dongyan, member of the Standing Committee, enjoyed a visit to the Immortal Cave and Big Tianchi today, and will return to Nanjing soon. It is learned that the party's newspaper's suggestion to convene the Lushan Talk Conference has not yet been formally proposed to Chairman Chiang.

[Central News Agency, Kuling Dispatch, 5th] Amidst widespread rumors that a talk conference would be held in Lushan, reporters inquired with reliable sources, who replied that they had not heard of it.

[Our Kuling Dispatch, 15th] People here who understand the government solemnly stated that the government has always been tolerant and yielding towards the CCP. Regarding the Communist army, it does not require them to completely withdraw from the areas they occupied after the truce order, but only requires them to withdraw from some areas that already constitute a threat to peace and obstruct traffic. Currently, this area is mainly in northern Jiangsu.

America Values the Chairman's Message

[US News Service, Washington Dispatch, 14th] When the State Department was asked about its views on Chairman Chiang's Victory Day message, a spokesperson replied: The State Department is extremely interested in this message, but diplomatic circles have some disappointment with Chairman Chiang's message. They believe that Chairman Chiang's message failed to address the current situation. Observers believe that the message is nothing more than a restatement of Chiang's consistent position over the past four years. Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart have discovered that the Nationalist government is unwilling to discuss politics with the CCP unless the CCP lays down its arms. On the other hand, the CCP insists that it must lay down its arms only after political negotiations.

[Central News Agency, New York Dispatch, 14th] The New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune both published Chairman Chiang's message on the front page in a prominent position, but did not elaborate. Most headlines emphasized Chairman Chiang's guarantee to end one-party rule.

### Robertson and Ye Jianying Leave Nanjing
### Visit Special Envoy Ma Together with Zhou Enlai Before Departure

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] Robertson, the American member of the Peiping Military Mediation Department, and Ye Jianying, the Communist member, arrived in Nanjing yesterday. That evening, they separately had long talks with Marshal Ma and Zhou Enlai. On the morning of the 15th, they met with Marshal Ma again. At 3:30 PM, Ye Jianying left Nanjing to return to Peiping, while Robertson flew to Shanghai with Rooks, the head of the US Military Advisory Group in China.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] Marshal Ma received Robertson, Zhou Enlai, and Ye Jianying at 10:30 AM on the 15th to discuss the Anping incident in detail. It is also rumored that the content of today's conversation may have involved the Peiping Military Mediation Department, because the work of the Executive Headquarters has obviously completely stalled. However, Marshal Ma is still carefully considering whether to abolish it or strengthen it. According to the opinions of some people, the only way to strengthen the work of the Executive Headquarters is to strengthen the power of the American mediation personnel, but it is naturally impossible to obtain the CCP's consent. Some people say that if the Executive Headquarters is indeed abolished, it will be when Marshal Ma formally expresses his failure in the peace negotiations.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] It is learned that the CCP had sent a note to Marshal Ma regarding the Anping incident, explaining the actual situation. The outside world mostly does not know its content. Observers believe that the Anping incident was a major diplomatic failure for the CCP. Before this incident occurred, members of the US Congress had repeatedly discussed China policy, considering withdrawing troops and stopping the Lend-Lease Act and military aid to China. However, after the Anping incident occurred, Americans who sympathized with the CCP immediately changed their views. Therefore, the issues that were under consideration are no longer the focus of attention in the US government and public.

### Anping Incident Report
### US and Communist Sides Argue Pointedly

Twenty-Five Person Group to Meet Again Today

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 15th] The Twenty-Five Person Group is scheduled to meet again on the morning of the 16th and may begin to hear testimony from Executive Headquarters staff Major Fritz and Duke, who were traveling in US military patrol vehicles. The investigation conducted by the group in the past two weeks has been very limited. Davis, in his preliminary report to Robertson, only pointed out the following points: (1) The opponent in the US Marine Corps conflict was probably the Communist army. (2) The location of the conflict was not regularly occupied by any troops or residents, but was farmland along the Peiping-Tianjin Highway, and anyone who appeared there at noon on July 29th was temporarily from elsewhere. (3) The commander of the Communist army participating in the conflict and the mission of his troops have not been determined. (4) The group has not obtained any evidence that the National Army participated in the conflict. As for the Communist representative Huang Yifeng, he explained Davis' report in his report: (1) Anping Town was originally a Communist army station, but has now been occupied by government troops. (2) The conflict location specified by the US participants Major Fritz and Duke has no traces of war. (3) The conflict location referred to by the US is a flat plain with open terrain and no deep trenches on both sides of the highway. (4) There are no wheelbarrows or deep pits obstructing progress in the US report. (5) There are no bunkers in the US report. The report of the government representative Zhang Shuheng did not mention the results of the on-site investigation.

### Chaotic and Serious Situation
### Entirely Created by the CCP

Nanyang Business Daily of Singapore Comments on the Current Situation

[Central News Agency, Singapore Dispatch, 15th] An important Chinese newspaper here published an article this morning entitled "Who Should Be Responsible for the Failure of Peace Negotiations," stating that the CCP should be responsible for creating the chaotic and serious situation in our country, and believes that peace negotiations are indeed hopeless. Although a military solution will lead to disaster, it is not unimaginable. This move may at least save the people from long-term suffering. Also, all Chinese newspapers here today published the Chairman's message on the front page. This is the first time that overseas Chinese here have had the opportunity to read the original text of the leader's message issued on the same day.

### CCP Attacks Marshal Ma

Zhou Enlai to Also Issue a Document

[Our Report] Regarding the rumor that the CCP advocates submitting the China problem to the United Nations Security Council for resolution, Chen Jiakang, the CCP spokesperson, said that it was only a rumor and could not be confirmed. When asked whether the CCP still advocates mediation by Marshall, Chen replied: This matter will be announced in Zhou Enlai's document. When reporters asked about the content of the document, Chen replied: "There is a document, but it probably will not be issued today. I am far away in Shanghai and cannot speculate." Chen denied the rumors that the CCP had signed a treaty with the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia, calling them "rumors spread in Peiping that are completely untrue." Chen did not comment on the Chairman's message, only saying that under the current circumstances, the CCP maintaining silence may be more beneficial to the situation.

[Associated Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] People here generally believe that the Communist Party's vigorous attacks on Special Envoy Marshall are a prelude to the Communist Party's request for the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States to jointly mediate the conflict in China.

[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The Yan'an Liberation Daily editorial today publicly attacked Special Envoy Marshall for the first time, saying that he cannot shirk his responsibility for failing to stop the conflict in China. The newspaper also fiercely criticized American military aid to the Nationalist government. In the past, the Communist Party criticized the impropriety of American aid to China and the presence of US troops in China, while often complimenting Marshal Ma personally for his efforts in mediating peace. Now the tone has changed.

### Datong's North Gate Once Breached
### Fierce Battle Unfolds at Niangziguan

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 15th] A fierce battle is unfolding at Niangziguan. Around 2:00 PM on the 14th, the Communist army launched a fierce attack on the station with more than 7,000 troops. The fierce battle was still ongoing until the evening.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan Dispatch, 15th] About two regiments of Communist troops in Shanxi attempted to actively sabotage the Zhengtai Railway and launched a fierce attack on Yangyi Town east of Taigu. Although our defending troops dealt a heavy blow, they were occupied due to the disparity in numbers.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The situation in Datong is critical. The North Gate was once breached by the Communist army besieging the city. The battle at Shacen is fierce and unprecedented. The Pingwang Airport is still in the hands of the National Army.

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 15th] Military news: The Datong battle is still ongoing intermittently on the periphery. The government still secures the airport. The statement that the battle has been extended to the city is inaccurate. However, officials announced today that a cannonball landed near the residence of a group in the city.

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 15th] Official sources say that Liu Bocheng is now leading an army of 100,000 troops, advancing and retreating in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway. His troops have captured Lanfeng and arrived at Xinglongji, pressing on Kaifeng. Official intelligence says that Liu has been appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Communist army in North China and the commander-in-chief of the Peiping-Hankou Railway. Those who moved out at the same time as Liu Bocheng also included Cheng Yuan's unit attacking Huangkou Station and Dangshan and the New Fourth Army attacking Sixian. In addition, more than 10,000 Communist troops were found in Guguzhai, 30 miles southeast of Xinxiang, northern Henan, yesterday morning. According to an analysis by a qualified person, the Communist army's move is to cut off the connection between the Nationalist army in the protruding area of northern Henan (Anyang Xinxiang) and the Nationalist army south of the Yellow River, and to threaten Xuzhou.

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 15th] The Military Mediation Department is extremely concerned about the conflict in eastern Henan and plans to order the Xinxiang Tenth Group to send a subgroup to Kaifeng to curb the conflict.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng Dispatch, 15th] Liu Bocheng's Communist army is now advancing along the Longhai Railway in the eastern and western areas of Kaocheng Lanfeng.

After noon, guards were stationed at major intersections, and armed patrols patrolled the streets. The period of validity of this emergency order and special alert is three days, from the 15th to the 17th.

According to another Changchun telegram, three government planes flew over important cities in the Northeast yesterday morning, dropping leaflets. The planes departed from Shenyang, and leaflets were also dropped in Harbin, which is controlled by the Communist Party.

[Central News Agency, Kuling, 15th] Recently, people in industrial and commercial circles in the valleys of Jing, Hu, and Hang (Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou), recognizing that the crisis in their respective industries is deepening, have requested the government to provide relief.

According to Chief Clerk Wu, the contents of the petitions from industrial and commercial circles in various places can be summarized into four major points. The government can accept most of them with slight revisions. However, one suggestion involves organizing an industrial investment company to develop industries, because the original proposal involved using Chinese people's deposits abroad as capital. This move requires the consent of the owners in accordance with the law, so it needs to be considered carefully.

### Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Chairman, Supporting the Points Revealed in the Proclamation; Also Telegraphs Mao Zedong, Calling for Unified Compilation

[This newspaper's report] Yesterday (the 15th), the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed Chairman Chiang, supporting the points revealed in the Chairman's message to the people of the whole country. At the same time, it also telegraphed Mao Zedong, urging him to immediately order his subordinates to implement unified compilation. The two telegrams are recorded separately below:

Telegram to Chairman Chiang

Respectfully, Chairman Chiang, Kuling National Government: In recent months, the domestic situation has become increasingly tense, with the possibility of expansion and spread at any time. People at home are informing each other in alarm, fearing the collapse of the building. International observations and friendly foreign public opinion are also shocked and suspicious. Since reading in the newspaper Your Excellency's message to the people of the whole country on the 13th, revealing six points of future policy, with a selfless spirit, expressing the determination to start with the people, no matter how variable and dark the future is, with Your Excellency's sincere and frank proclamation, those who gloat will lose their tools of boasting, and those who hope for governance will strengthen their inclinations. It will not be difficult to transform hostility into peace and put the people at ease. On behalf of the city's industry and commerce, I express my heartfelt support.

Telegram to Mr. Mao Zedong

Respected Mr. Mao Zedong, Yan'an: Domestic consultations and mediation have dragged on for years, and peaceful unification has not yet yielded results, while the scourge of war has spread throughout the north of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, leaving the whole country at a loss and the world in fear. I read the Marshall joint declaration and learned that the crux of the problem lies in the Communist Army's refusal to withdraw and the insistence on setting up separatist regimes in the withdrawn areas, resulting in a deadlock in peace talks and causing economic collapse, which is an inevitable fact that every Chinese citizen is heartbroken about. Since the ceasefire and unified compilation already have a resolution based on political consultation, why should we inflict more suffering on our people and ruin the country's foundation? I represent the public opinion of the entire industrial and commercial community in Shanghai, and I appeal to you. I hope that you will immediately order your subordinates to withdraw from the railway lines, restore traffic, and implement unified compilation, so that the obstacles to peaceful unification can be eliminated and the crisis of economic collapse can be avoided, ending the separation and confrontation of more than 30 years, and ensuring the long-term stability of Shenzhou. Your great achievements will surely be recorded in history. Strive for this moment for the sake of the country and the party. I offer my sincere advice and hope you will adopt it.

### McKee and Powell Assigned to Come to China from the United States

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] Diplomatic circles report that the U.S. Department of State has assigned McKee, a member of the Federal Computation Committee of the Department, and Colonel Powell, an air transport policy advisor, to come to China. McKee is assigned to discuss with our country the disposal of surplus U.S. materials in China, while Colonel Powell is in charge of negotiating the civil aviation agreement between China and the United States. The two have already departed for China on the 7th of this month.

### National Army Transit No Longer Through Hong Kong; Transit Agreement Terminated Yesterday; Military Agencies to Close Offices

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 15th] From today, Chinese troops will no longer use Hong Kong as a transit point. After Japan's surrender, the Chinese government established an agreement with the Hong Kong government to use Hong Kong as a transit center for the Chinese military for one year. Now, Chairman Chiang has ordered its termination. In the past year, approximately 200,000 Chinese troops have been transferred through Hong Kong to various ports in North China. The authorities specifically requisitioned hundreds of houses in the Kowloon area to accommodate the Chinese troops. The homeowners have been notified that they can recover the houses for their own use this month. The Hong Kong government also supplied the food for the Chinese troops waiting for ships during transit. There are still approximately 2,000 Chinese troops waiting for ships in Kowloon. If ships are not available for a while, they will go to Guangzhou to wait. In addition, it is understood that the offices of the Chinese Army and the Military Affairs Department's special envoy in Hong Kong will also be closed. The transfer of enemy property in Hong Kong to this office is considerable, including 15,000 tons of ships and 80 vehicles of various types.

### Our Trial of War Criminals: Judicial Administration Has Drafted and Finalized the Plan; Takashi Sakai Scheduled for Public Trial on the 20th

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Takashi Sakai, the war criminal who ravaged Hong Kong, is scheduled to be retried in Beijing on the 20th. Tani Hisao, the culprit in the Nanjing Massacre, will also be tried here in the near future. A reporter visited Minister Xie of the Ministry of Judicial Administration and Director Yang of the Criminal Department to learn about the various situations related to the trial of war crimes: The Ministry of Judicial Administration began handling the lawsuits against enemy war criminals last winter. Initially, there were only a few thousand, but as more cases were sent from various places, they were organized and sent to the War Criminals Handling Committee of the Ministry of National Defense (including representatives from the Second Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan, and the Military Law Department of the Joint Logistics Headquarters) for handling. Some were sent to the Tokyo Far East National Defense Military Tribunal for reference and joint processing, or handed over to military tribunals in various places to begin investigation. However, the biggest difficulty in this matter is the lack of established laws to be cited and followed. Therefore, this Ministry has compiled various materials and drafted the "War Criminals Trial Measures" in accordance with the principles of international law, as the basis for the trial of war criminals. It has already been discussed by the committee in several meetings and will be finalized soon. The investigation of the Nanjing Massacre is currently being carried out by the War Criminals Handling Committee and the Municipal Council to collect material and human evidence. Once the preparatory work is completed, the public trial that the people of the whole country are looking forward to can begin, washing away the shocking stain in human history.

[Another dispatch] Takashi Sakai has been scheduled by the Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense to be publicly tried in Beijing at 3:00 PM on the 20th. The trial will be held in the auditorium of the Lizi Society on Huangpu Road. More than 500 pieces of important evidence related to the case have been collected. The presiding judge will be Shi Meiyu. Vice President Yu Xuezhong of the Military Senate, the wife of Central Committee member Zou Lu, and Gao Xingya, an officer of the Central Statistics Bureau, have been invited to testify. The defense attorney for the defendant is still Wang Long.

### Famous Chinese Architect Hou Xiangchen Passes Away

[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 15th] Hou Liangchen, a famous engineer in China's architectural field, passed away in Chengdu on the 12th at the age of 70. Hou came to Chengdu before the war and successively supervised the construction of Sichuan University and other major projects. He devoted himself to the Chinese architectural field for 50 years. The Summer Palace in Beijing and the mausoleums of Emperor Guangxu and Empress Dowager Cixi were all supervised by him personally. He once hand-painted a book of "Xiangchen Architectural Drawings".

### Zhejiang Chairman Changes Departure Date for Inspection

[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 15th] Zhejiang Chairman Shen Honglie, originally scheduled to depart for inspection today, has changed his departure date to the 16th to inspect the Ningbo and Shaoxing areas due to important official matters in the provincial capital. The route will be to first inspect Xiaoshan and Changxing, then to Shaoxing for a brief stay, then to Yuyao, Shangyu, Cixi, Ningbo, Fenghua, Zhenhai, Dinghai and other places, for a period of half a month.

Local Correspondences

### Military Grain Allocation Must Not Be Delayed: Jiangsu Provincial Government Pre-collects Land Tax

[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang Express News] On the 13th, the Jiangsu Provincial Government telegraphed relevant counties that the previously purchased military grain had been transferred to merchants with the approval of the Central Government. Except for those counties, districts, townships, and bao that have already been collected, which should still be transported to the designated warehouse or supply station, the rest are allowed to be exempted from pursuit. However, military grain for August and September of this year will be collected in advance from land tax to meet urgent needs. Because the environment in northern Jiangsu is becoming clearer, the allocation of military grain must not be delayed. All previously determined pre-collection measures must be implemented immediately.

Kunshan

Donations to Relieve Refugees in Northern Jiangsu

The county government in this district believes that the refugees in northern Jiangsu are fleeing to the south of the Yangtze River, without clothes or food, and their situation is extremely miserable, and should be relieved as much as possible. After convening a meeting, it was decided that the person in charge of each entertainment venue will add 50 yuan to each ticket for donations to relieve refugees, starting on the 12th. It is stipulated that the donations will be sent to the county government for transfer every five days.

Wuxi

Enemy Puppet Secret Agent Arrested and Sent to Changzhou

Zhang Tingqian, also known as Jin Geng, a 27-year-old resident of No. 16 Nanshi Bridge Alley in the city, who runs a hot water shop, is from Yancheng, northern Jiangsu. During the fall of Wuxi, he served as a secret agent and translator for the enemy's Kempeitai Sasaki Garrison. He was a cohort of the fleeing Jin Renchu and was unscrupulous in his actions. Recently, Zhang was carrying a short gun, posing as a special agent, and entering theaters to cause trouble with the gun. This was discovered by the City Defense Headquarters, which arrested Zhang. On the 14th, he was sent to the First Pacification Zone Command in Changzhou for strict handling.

Mingguang

Northeast Anhui Supervision Group Leaves Mingguang

The Northeast Anhui Party and Government Work Supervision Group came to Mingguang to work for three days. Now that their mission here has been completed, Wan Changyan, a member of the Anhui Provincial Government, and Li Renfu, a member of the Provincial Party Headquarters, led the group to take the southbound Victory Express to Chuzhou at 2:00 PM on the 12th of this month. The heads of various agencies in the county welcomed them at the station.

Songjiang

Case of Fraud in Collection of Business Tax

Mr. Xue Yunbo of Sijing Town in this county reported that the local Direct Tax Bureau sent a group of three people, Zhang Fengchi and Wang Guangrun, to Sijing to collect business tax at the beginning of last month. After the actual collection figures for each industry were determined, such as the silk and cloth industry paying 2.3 million yuan and the sundries industry paying 2.7 million yuan, the silk and cloth industry was given temporary receipts, while the sundries industry was not. After Zhang and others finished collecting taxes in the entire town, they held a banquet for the Town Chamber of Commerce and the leaders of various guilds, but not many people attended enthusiastically. Before leaving, they took back all the temporary receipts that had been issued and handed the official receipts for each industry to the Town Chamber of Commerce staff for distribution to each guild. As a result, the verification results of each industry were vastly different from the actual payment figures. The sundries industry's 2.7 million yuan only had receipts for 1.5 million yuan, while the silk and cloth industry's 2.3 million yuan only had receipts for 1.03 million yuan. Most other industries were similar. Therefore, evidence was collected, the facts were presented, and the matter was reported. The Ministry of Finance's Direct Tax Bureau was requested to investigate thoroughly. The bureau sent people to Sijing to investigate and found that the fraud was true, and submitted a report for verification.

Hangzhou

Fire at the Great World Cinema

At around 11 PM on the 13th, a fire broke out in the three-story open-air cinema of the Great World in West Lake in this city. During the screening of a movie, the technician accidentally caused a short circuit, and the burning celluloid film and wires caught fire. At that time, the audience at the scene panicked and rushed to the exit, causing chaos. They rushed towards the drama theater, and a large number of spectators scrambled downstairs. Unexpectedly, the stairs were not very sturdy, and the stairs collapsed under excessive load with a loud crash. An old woman died on the spot, and 21 others were slightly or seriously injured, who were sent to the hospital by the police.

### International Intervention? Or Public Judgment?

—We oppose the former and advocate for the latter—

The government and the Chinese Communists (CCP) are locked in unresolved disputes, and mediation has yet to succeed. Consequently, two different arguments have recently emerged. The CCP is loudly advocating for international intervention, while the *China Times* proposes that both the Kuomintang (KMT) and CCP should listen to the people's opinions at this time, as this is the highest form of public judgment. Our newspaper's editorial on the 12th offered more specific suggestions for a national conference, naturally advocating for public judgment. Today, we further explain our reasons for opposing international intervention.

After Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart jointly issued a statement, opinions varied, but everyone recognized it as a serious warning from friendly nations to both sides. This indicated that peace negotiations had reached a critical point, yet there was still hope that both sides would reflect deeply and achieve profound understanding to avert national disaster. When Chairman Chiang issued a statement the day before yesterday, solemnly declaring his consistent stance of resolving political disputes through political means, everyone believed that the prospects for peace had not yet reached an impasse. However, observing the CCP's expressions in recent days is truly disheartening, making us genuinely pessimistic about the future of peace.

A dispatch from the *Agence France-Presse* in Nanjing on the 12th stated: "According to reliable sources, CCP representative Zhou Enlai informed Special Envoy Marshall this morning that if peace cannot be achieved under the current circumstances, the Chinese issue will be submitted to the United Nations Security Council for resolution. At the same time, CCP spokesperson Wang Bingnan also brazenly explained the CCP's reasons for advocating submitting the Chinese issue to the United Nations, claiming that since Britain and the Soviet Union were signatories to the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference declaration of December last year, they should have equal standing with the United States in the Chinese peace negotiations." A dispatch from the Associated Press in Nanjing on the 14th stated that the *Liberation Daily* in Yan'an published an editorial on the 13th, which, in addition to attacking Special Envoy Marshall, also made similar claims. If these two dispatches are entirely accurate, then we must first point out to our readers that the CCP representatives' preposterous and erroneous arguments conceal cowardice, selfishness, and malicious intentions.

After the victorious conclusion of our nation's war of resistance, every descendant of the Yellow Emperor, every patriotic son and daughter, fervently hoped that our motherland could quickly achieve unification and become a great power, not only to survive gloriously among the nations but also to faithfully fulfill the obligations stipulated in the United Nations Charter, in order to fulfill its responsibility to maintain world peace, and to be worthy of being one of the Four or Five Great Powers. However, the result of the year since the victory of the war of resistance is that this common dream of the entire nation has almost completely shattered. Not only is the status of one of the Four or Five Great Powers wavering, but also we cannot handle our own domestic affairs, and we must trouble two mediators from friendly nations to run around and mediate. After ten months, mediation is not yet hopeless, but the CCP suddenly has a whimsical idea, advocating for submitting its own affairs for the United Nations to handle. It is not enough to sweep the nation's face and national character into the dust. The CCP only considers the self-interest of a single party from the perspective of a faction, without thinking about the interests of the entire nation. Isn't this counterproductive action cutting itself off from the people of the country?

It is obvious that the CCP does not want the nation to be unified and powerful, so let us put that aside for the moment. If we observe the CCP's suggestion from the perspective of international law, we also find it childish to the point of being ludicrous. First, the United Nations is an international organization. The purpose of the Security Council is to promote the creation and maintenance of international peace and security, and its method emphasizes resolving all international disputes through peaceful means. It has no right to handle the internal disputes of various countries. Even if a country degenerates and wants to submit its domestic problems to the Security Council, only the sole legitimate central government recognized by all countries can file a complaint. No other party can appeal to the United Nations. Second, because the permanent members of the Security Council can exercise the "veto power" when dealing with international disputes, whether it is an effective mechanism for peacefully resolving international disputes is still a serious question. Submitting the Chinese issue to the United Nations will not only waste time but also increase international conflicts. Third, China is one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. If it submits its own domestic disputes for discussion, China's position in the international community will plummet. The world's people's perception of China will be unimaginable. Only those who are willing to degenerate and lower their national character would support this shameless proposition. No wonder the person in charge of the Chinese Youth Party publicly declared his opposition.

As for Mr. Wang Bingnan's statement that Britain and the Soviet Union should have equal status with the United States in the Chinese peace negotiations, the reasoning he relies on is also specious. First, the US government sent Special Envoy Marshall to China to mediate the KMT-CCP negotiations, so that China could create a peaceful, unified, and democratic country as soon as possible. This is a consistent US policy towards China, not based on the decision of the Three Foreign Ministers Conference in Moscow. Second, China did not attend the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. The Chinese government's opinion was not sought in advance for the decision made on the Chinese issue, and the Chinese government had no intention of recognizing it afterward. China certainly does not accept the constraints of this resolution. Third, the United States' mediation of the Chinese peace negotiations has been unanimously agreed to and welcomed by the Chinese government and the public, and the British government has already stated that it is unwilling to mediate the Chinese internal disputes. Why should we force other countries to come forward to mediate? Fourth, the independence of Korea, which was recognized in the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference agreement, has not yet been implemented. The US authorities are expressing dissatisfaction. What value does it have as a basis for interfering in the Chinese issue?

In short, the CCP representatives are not unaware of the above reasons, but in reality, they have other ambitions. To put it bluntly, the CCP is trying every means to open a door for international intervention, not only wanting to lower China's international status, making it a country that no one cares about, but also to turn China into a second Spain, with endless wars. In this way, the CCP can take advantage of the chaos to achieve its own selfish desires. Therefore, the CCP representatives put forward this absurd proposition after the issuance of the Marshall-Stuart joint statement, but it is a kind of propaganda offensive, attempting to confuse domestic and international audiences, and has no substantive significance, and there is fundamentally no value in studying it. We hope that if the CCP still has a concept of the nation, it should immediately implement the plans for unified compilation of troops and the restoration of transportation. If not, it can also attend the upcoming Lushan Conference and listen to the public judgment. This is the right path.

### Foreign Minister Wang Presides Over the Peace Conference, Finnish Representative Attends and Delivers a Speech, Requests a Reduction in the Excessive Reparations to the Soviet Union, Hopes to Obtain a Stable Foundation for Independent Existence From Now On

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Paris, 15th - The Peace Conference continued its meeting at 10:05 this morning, with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie taking the chair for three days in rotation. After Foreign Minister Wang delivered a speech in English, Czech representative Masaryk followed up with a speech explaining his country's views on the Hungarian Foreign Minister's speech. When the Peace Conference resumed at 3:05 p.m. (Paris time), the Finnish delegation was invited to enter the chamber. Finnish Foreign Minister Enckell then took the podium and spoke in fluent French, first thanking the conference for allowing him to express his views. He then stated that Finland has always been at the forefront of democracy. After signing the armistice agreement, the Finnish people immediately declared war on Germany and eventually drove the Germans out of the country, but it was achieved at a heavy sacrifice. The true will of the Finnish people can be seen from this. Regarding Soviet-Finnish relations, Enckell said that for the sake of peace in that part of Europe, it is necessary for the two countries to cooperate permanently. Finland is willing to carefully implement the armistice agreement, but Finland is a defeated country and is now encountering various major difficulties in fulfilling the peace treaty. Finland has lost most of the important central province of Viipuri, occupying 23,000 square kilometers. A large number of residents have to be relocated, and their property on the ground has been damaged, which has delayed the reconstruction work and the payment of debts. In addition, Finland lost Petsamo, which has special importance to the Finnish people's economic life, and Porkkala, near the Finnish capital of Helsinki. Due to the importance of these land concessions, Finland hopes that the relevant territorial clauses in the peace treaty can be eased in the end. The points where the armistice agreement affects the Finnish people's economic life have been detailed in the memorandum submitted to the conference. Finland's production capacity has been ravaged by two wars, and the reparations to the Soviet Union are as high as 300 million US dollars. Without external support, it is truly powerless to pay and unable to maintain its domestic living standards and restore its production capacity, because Finland cannot expect to improve its foreign trade. Enckell hopes that the reparations can be reduced by 100 million US dollars, so that there may be greater certainty in fulfilling the treaty. The Finnish representative finally expressed his gratitude to the great powers, such as the Soviet Union and Germany and Italy. He wished that the morality of eternal friendship between the Soviet and Finnish peoples would begin from this point onward, and at the same time hoped to give Finland a stable foundation for independent existence.

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Paris, 15th - Representatives of Cuba, Albania, Mexico, and Egypt will be invited to present their respective views at the plenary session this Saturday.

Foreign Minister Wang Shijie

### Hungarian Foreign Minister Expresses Opinions, Pleads for Minority Nationalities

[United Press, Paris, 14th] Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyöngyösi, following Bulgarian Foreign Minister Kulishev, presented his views at the Peace Conference today, requesting assistance for the oppressed Hungarian minorities in Romania and Czechoslovakia. He also stated that Hungary finds it difficult to recognize the ceding of Outer Transylvania to Romania. Gyöngyösi declared that democratic Hungary has risen from the turmoil of war, but even today, human rights are completely disregarded, and countless Hungarians are often expelled from Czechoslovakia within hours, with only their personal belongings. Approximately 650,000 Hungarians in Slovakia have been deprived of their citizenship and the most basic human rights, and their goods have been confiscated. The plight of more than 1.5 million Hungarians in Romania and Czechoslovakia since the end of the war is disturbing. Chairman Byrnes immediately ordered the secretary-general to escort the Hungarian delegation out of the meeting. Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk then declared that "the Czech delegation intends to study this astonishing and unprecedented speech by the Hungarian Foreign Minister and respond to it tomorrow morning. Earlier, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Kulishev spoke, requesting Greece to return the province of Western Thrace. This request was supported by Ukrainian representative Manuilsky. Greek representative Tsaldaris immediately refuted it, strongly arguing that the Four Foreign Ministers' draft treaty was not severe enough on Bulgaria.

### World Women's Representatives Demand to Participate in the Peace Conference

[Reuters, London, 14th] Mrs. Rogers, the American representative of the World Women's Equal Rights Party, arrived in London today, demanding that the Paris Peace Conference allow women representatives to participate. Mrs. Rogers believes that women from all countries should have a seat in the Peace Conference, and women should also have a voice in the future of the world.

### Committee Established for Italian Peace Treaty

Trieste Issue is the Most Troublesome

[Associated Press, Paris, 14th] The committee for the Italian Peace Treaty was established this morning. The Trieste issue is one of the most difficult, with complex opinions among the four powers and no consensus on how to handle the port of Trieste. The committee also needs to deal with the former Italian colonies and the issue of Italian reparations. These issues are also quite difficult, but not as much as the Trieste issue.

### France is Willing to Rebuild Friendly Relations with Italy

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Paris, 15th Emergency Broadcast: French President Pidu has just declared: France hopes to rebuild peaceful and friendly relations with Italy.

### Byrnes' Speech in Response to the Soviet Union

Says the United States Has Absolutely No Territorial Desires and is Willing to Help Countries With Economic Recovery

[United Press, Paris, 15th] US Secretary of State Byrnes delivered a speech to the Peace Conference today, apparently directed at the Soviet Union, stating that economic treaties concluded in violation of the Potsdam Agreement will lead to "enslavement and adventure." At the same time, Byrnes expressed his disagreement with the Soviet claim that some countries had become wealthy during the war. "Which great power has become wealthy during the war? I know definitively that no country has." I hope that the Soviet spokesman is not referring to the 10 billion US dollars in public lending from the United States. Before the offensive, President Roosevelt announced that the United States would be a symbol of democracy. The United States did not ask for compensation, but only asked for freedom for all mankind. The United States also does not ask for territory or compensation. The United States now wants to help any country's economic recovery.

### Britain and the Soviet Union Deploy Troops on the Border, Iranian Army Implements Alert, Soviet Troops are Concentrating in the Port of Odessa, Intentions Against Britain or Against Turkey are Unclear

[Associated Press, Tehran, 14th] The Central Government Army of 15,800 today implemented an alert in Qazvin, because it was heard that the Democrats of Azerbaijan were concentrating one hundred miles north of that location. The reason for the Democrats' concentration is unknown, but some people say that this is "to prevent accidents." The British Consul General, who was summoned to Tehran by the British Ambassador to Iran to discuss British-Iranian relations, has returned to his residence. Since the news of the appearance of British cruisers in the Persian Gulf spread last month, it has been rumored that Soviet troops are concentrating on the Azerbaijani border. These messages are neither verifiable nor deniable. The Iranian Minister of the Army told the Associated Press reporter that we cannot understand the truth of the local situation, because we have no direct contact with the Soviet-Azerbaijani border.

[United Press, 14th] Iranian Ambassador to the United States Ala declared today: He has received news of the Soviet Union concentrating troops in the Caucasus region north of Iran, but the report does not indicate the purpose of concentrating troops. Are these troops used to counter British pressure on Iran in the south, or is it because the Soviet Union has made new demands for direct control of the Dardanelles, exerting pressure on Turkey? This move has caused a serious situation among Britain, Iraq, and Iran. Diplomatic circles here are also rumored that the Soviet Union has concentrated some troops in the area of the Black Sea port of Odessa, and its purpose is also unknown.

### Turkey Submits Reply, Rejects Soviet Demands, The Spirit of the Montreux Convention, Signatory Countries Cannot Violate

[United Press, Istanbul, 14th] Well-informed sources announced today that the Turkish government has submitted a reply, firmly rejecting the Soviet Union's request to revise the Montreux Convention to allow the Black Sea countries to jointly manage the Dardanelles Strait and to jointly protect it by the Soviet Union and Turkey.

[Reuters, London, 15th] Well-informed sources said that Turkey's reply to the Soviet Union's note requesting amendments to the Montreux Convention refutes the claim that Turkey violated the Convention during the war. The Soviet government's note pointed out that during the war, the Turkish government allowed German and Italian patrol boats and auxiliary ships to pass through the straits into the Black Sea, which was a violation of the Convention. Therefore, the Soviet Union believes that the Montreux Convention was not sufficient to protect the safety of the Black Sea during the war and must be revised so that the Soviet Union can jointly be responsible with Turkey for the defense of the straits. Article 19 of the Convention stipulates that during the war, if Turkey is not a belligerent, it should not allow warships of belligerent countries to pass through the straits. Therefore, the problem lies in how to define warships. The Turkish government's reply should point out that the Axis ships passing through the straits were not warships as defined in the Convention. Chapter 1 of the Annex to the Convention defines warships based on the definition of the London Naval Treaty of March 1, 1936.

Turkish President İnönü

### Soviet Government Announces Documents, Accusing Turkey of Colluding with Germany

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 15th] The Soviet government recently announced several documents copied from the former German Foreign Ministry files, proving that Turkey had colluded with Germany, one of which was a telegram signed by Gilling, the former German Minister to Romania, mentioning the conversation between the German Foreign Minister and the Turkish Ambassador to Romania in Bucharest. The Turkish Ambassador stated that although Turkey would continue to strictly maintain neutrality, it would always regard the Soviet Union as a major enemy. Another document involved the conversation between the German Plenipotentiary Minister Henting and Galon, a special envoy sent by the former Turkish Army Chief of Staff, Çolak. Çolak said that the conflict between Turkey and the Soviet Union was almost inevitable. Once the Turkish military was completed, the war would begin. Turkey's offensive was planned to go through the Iranian plateau directly to the Baku oil source. In addition, the former German Ambassador to Turkey, Papen, informed the German Foreign Ministry that Çolak proposed that some Turkish citizens familiar with the Caucasus situation should be sent to Germany. On the other hand, Çolak expressed his willingness to dismiss some Caucasus and Azerbaijani officers to comply with German intentions. Çolak also told Papen that the Soviet Union had completed various aircraft factories in Kiseovsk and Tomsk and installed various equipment in the Ufa oil fields.

[Agence France-Presse, Turkish Capital, 14th] The Turkish government stated in its reply that Turkey cannot sign new agreements with a small number of countries to replace the 1936 Convention. In short, the Turkish government will still abide by the spirit of the Montreux Convention and believes that this is the only diplomatic document governing the Dardanelles Strait and cannot be violated.

### US and British Statement on Attitude

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th] Regarding the Soviet Union's note to Turkey regarding the Dardanelles Strait, according to diplomatic circles, not only is the United States unable to accept it, but also any other signatory to the Montreux Convention is unable to accept it. The Soviet Union's proposal seems to have returned to 19th-century diplomacy, in which there is not a single word about the United Nations.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] A Foreign Office spokesman declared that Britain cannot agree to any steps taken by the Soviet Union in order for the Soviet Union and Turkey to conduct direct negotiations on the straits issue. Political observers here believe that the British government will take a tough stance on this matter, which is clear evidence of this.

### We Buy More of the US Surplus Ships

[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] The Naval Committee declared that China has requested to purchase the largest portion of the 1,389 surplus merchant ships specified for sale, 159 ships.

### On the Palestine Issue, the United States Proposes a Compromise Plan, The British Cabinet Will Convene a Meeting to Discuss

[Reuters, Washington, 14th] Authoritative sources said: President Truman has approved the compromise plan for the Palestine issue proposed by Acting Secretary of State Acheson as the basis for discussion with both the Jewish and Arab communities. The US President has sent this plan directly to British Prime Minister Attlee, saying that if this can be the basis for negotiations with the Jewish and Arab communities, the United States is willing to provide moral assistance. It is understood that the plan still supports the partition of Palestine, but the area of the Jewish province is larger than originally proposed by British and American experts, and the Jewish province also has greater autonomy on issues such as immigration taxes.

[United Press, London, 15th] According to well-informed and responsible Foreign Office officials, President Truman today opposed the plan of the British-American Committee to establish a federal system in Palestine. Therefore, Britain feels that it is necessary to find a new solution to the Palestine issue. The President's note stated that the United States cannot accept or oppose this plan for the time being without the support of the people. Britain, as the mandatory power, should adapt to the environment and take wise actions.

### Palestinian Terrorist Actions

Illegal Immigrants Continue to Enter

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 15th Broadcast: Palestinian terrorist actions are becoming more intense.

Anniversary of Japan's Surrender

### My Prosecutor Accuses in Court: Atrocities of the Japanese Army in China, American Reporters Guth Continue to Testify Yesterday, Reverend Magin Speaks of the Nanjing Massacre

[Special Dispatch from To-a Company, Tokyo, 15th] Today marks the anniversary of Emperor Hirohito's radio address to the nation announcing Japan's surrender last year. Former Foreign Minister Tōgō, who advocated for peace during the Imperial Conference, and General Umezu, the Chief of the General Staff who supported Army Minister Anami, are both prisoners of war on this historic day, sitting side by side in the defendant's dock at the International Tribunal. Former American reporter stationed in Peiping, Guth, continued to testify today, first recounting the establishment of puppet regimes by the Japanese in Peiping, Nanjing, and Mengjiang, as well as their economic aggression. He stated that all factories in Shanxi Province were operated by the Japanese army, while in other areas, the "North China Development Company" in North China and the "Central China Promotion Company" in Central China monopolized everything. Subsequently, my prosecutor, Mr. Xiang Zhexun, in fluent English, accused the Japanese army of atrocities, stating: "What I wish to discuss today is a portion of the general acts of cruelty and crimes against humanity. This includes murder, torture, rape, robbery, unlawful destruction, etc. From 1937 to 1945, the Japanese army committed these inhumane crimes in the occupied areas of China, the most prominent of which was the Nanjing Massacre. Japanese soldiers committed this atrocity with the consent of their commanders and the Tokyo headquarters, in an attempt to permanently eliminate China's will to resist. This is the Japanese way of warfare. Furthermore, Japan used narcotics as part of its plan to conquer China. In short, Japan's policy of poisoning China aimed to reduce the physical strength of the Chinese people, weaken their resistance, and obtain the vast funds needed for military and economic aggression." Following Mr. Xiang's statement, Reverend John Magin, who resided in Nanjing from 1912 to 1940, testified, recounting the rape and looting committed by the Japanese army in Nanjing, stating that the atrocities committed by the Japanese army against the citizens of Nanjing during the occupation were beyond words to describe.

[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] The International Military Tribunal began today to examine the economic aggression crimes of the Japanese Zaibatsu. American writer Guth testified, stating that the Japanese army established puppet governments in North China, looting at will and controlling the economic lifeline of the Chinese people. Defense attorney Roh rebutted, stating that Chief Justice Webb had declared on July 24th that "economic aggression is not a crime." Webb sternly replied, "If it is linked to aggression, it is certainly a crime." Economic crimes are the fourth stage of the indictment. Propaganda campaigns, the Manchurian Incident, and the North China Incident have already been indicted. Prosecutor-General Keenan indicated that the investigation will be divided into twelve stages and will be completed by the end of September of this year.

### Many State Department Officials Dismissed, Salaries of Diplomats Increased, Diplomatic Institute Established to Train New Talent

[United Press, Washington, 14th] The State Department today released a letter from Bernath to Congressman Smathers, Chairman of the House Rules Committee, stating that forty State Department civil servants with close ties to foreign governments have been dismissed. Rumors that these civil servants were dismissed due to communist tendencies, communist activities, or being members of the Communist Party, numbering thousands or even hundreds, are inaccurate. Bernath's letter also stated that 4,000 civil servants from other government agencies were transferred to the State Department for employment, of which 3,000 have been reviewed and 285 were deemed unsuitable for long-term employment, including 79 who have already been dismissed.

[United Press, Washington, 14th] President Truman signed a law today increasing the annual salaries of top-level diplomats from $17,500 to $25,000 to enable American diplomats to strive for peace more effectively. This move by the President is the biggest reform of the American diplomatic service in 22 years. The law also increases the annual salaries of lower-level diplomats to $13,500. In addition, it stipulates the establishment of a diplomatic institute, modeled after the military academies, to train diplomatic talent. Members of the embassy staff will return to the country for training every two years to familiarize themselves with the domestic situation. Diplomatic personnel with poor performance will be dismissed.

### Historical Materials on the Iranian Issue

— ——Compiled by our Editorial Department——

Since the end of World War II, the Iranian issue has consistently been an important international problem. During the United Nations General Assembly in January of this year, Britain and the Soviet Union engaged in a fierce debate over the Iranian issue, and it was later decided that the Soviet Union and Iran would negotiate directly. When the United Nations Security Council opened, the United States and Britain included the Iranian issue on the agenda, which led to the Soviet representative withdrawing from the meeting, forming a serious crisis for the United Nations.

Later, the problem resolved itself. Now, several months later, the situation in Iran has become tense again, because the Soviet Union and Britain have both deployed troops on the Iranian border, and the Iranian army has also been mobilized. The situation, resources, and various post-war events related to Iran are comprehensively described as follows:

Iran's oldest name was "Parthia," later changed to Persia, and did not adopt its current name until March 21, 1935. Its total area is 1,643,000 square kilometers, three times that of pre-war France, slightly larger than Xinjiang in our country. Most of it is dry highlands. Except for the east, there are mountains on the northwest and south sides. The southeastern desert stretches, occupying almost half of the entire territory. Only the northwestern territory can be considered fertile. Iran has a population of only 15 million, with Persians accounting for about two-thirds of the total.

Vast Oil Fields Give Rise to Disputes

Iran produces a lot of petroleum, which is essential for modern transportation. In Iran, petroleum is truly everywhere. Before the development of petroleum, the Iranian people collected petroleum everywhere for lighting and cooking. According to recent estimates, Iran produces 13 million tons of petroleum per year, ranking fourth in the world in terms of output.

As early as 1901, an Englishman named D'Arcy, who made a fortune in gold mines in Australia, came to Persia to explore and discovered large deposits of petroleum. On May 28 of that year, he signed a contract with King Mozaffar ad-Din Shah of Persia, leasing 500,000 square miles (four-fifths of the country) of petroleum rights for a price of US$20,000. In 1909, the Burma Oil Company purchased D'Arcy's petroleum exploration rights and organized the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, which was registered on April 14, 1909, and officially began exploration and sales. The capital of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company was entirely British. Later, because Iran wanted to recover its oil rights, disputes arose between Britain and Iran. In 1933, with the mediation of the League of Nations, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Agreement was revised on April 28 of that year, slightly improving Iran's rights. In 1937, the Iranian King signed another contract with the United States, granting the United States the oil exploration rights in eastern Iran.

After World War II, in November of last year, the Azerbaijanis in northern Iran rebelled against the Iranian government and demanded autonomy. On November 20, they established a National Assembly, and later established an autonomous government, declaring their secession from the rule of Tehran.

The Iranian government believed that the charade of autonomy was directed by the Soviet Union, so it filed a complaint with the Security Council. However, before the Security Council could formally discuss the matter, the new Prime Minister Sadr issued an order to withdraw the complaint, and the United Nations General Assembly also decided to hand over the Iranian issue to the Soviet Union and Iran for direct negotiations.

Soviet Representative Withdraws, Problem Resolves Itself

When the Soviet Union and Iran were directly negotiating, Britain and the United States, seeing that the Soviet Union might gain control of the oil fields in northern Iran, successively sent notes to the Soviet Union, demanding an explanation for refusing to withdraw its troops from Iran. On March 13, American and British news agencies also said that the Soviet Union was greatly increasing its troops in Iran, advancing towards Tehran, the Iranian capital, on the one hand, and concentrating on the border between Iran, Turkey, and Iraq on the other, and that a war in the Middle East was about to break out. However, this rumor was immediately denied by TASS. However, the attitude of the United States was still very strong, expressing that it would fully support Iran in the Soviet-Iranian dispute.

When the Security Council had decided to open in New York on March 25, the Soviet-Iranian negotiations were in progress, and the Soviet troops in northern Iran had already made a partial withdrawal on March 2. Soviet Chief Representative Gromyko requested that the Security Council postpone the meeting from March 25 to April 10, but Truman insisted at a press conference on the 21st that the postponement was not possible. On March 23, Iranian Prime Minister Sadr suddenly broke his previous silence and said that the Soviet-Iranian issue might be resolved before the Security Council meeting, believing that the Security Council did not need to rush to discuss the Soviet-Iranian dispute. On March 24, Moscow Radio announced: Soviet troops had begun to withdraw from Iran on the 24th and could be completely withdrawn within five weeks. Stalin also declared that the Soviet-Iranian issue "has been completely resolved due to the agreement reached between the two governments." However, news came from the British side that Iran seemed to have agreed to the Soviet Union's demands, including Azerbaijan's autonomy, the Soviet Union's right to develop oil fields in northern Iran, and guarantees that Iran would be loyal to the Soviet Union in the future.

The Soviet Union took this action and withdrew its troops from Iran. The Soviet-Iranian dispute could theoretically be resolved through direct negotiations, but the United States insisted on including the Iranian issue on the agenda of the Security Council. On the 25th, the Security Council finally announced its opening in New York. After the meeting on the 26th, Soviet representative Gromyko requested that the Iranian issue not be included on the agenda, but was rejected by a vote of nine to two. After the adjournment, Gromyko proposed again that if the Iranian issue was included on the agenda, it should be postponed until April 10, but the United States insisted that the case should be accepted immediately and allowed the Iranian representative to make an oral statement. Therefore, Gromyko announced at the meeting on the 27th that he could not participate in the meeting, and the delegation withdrew from the venue at the same time.

Britain and the United States, in order to break the deadlock, agreed to postpone the discussion of the issue to April 3, and at the same time requested the Soviet Union and Iran to report to the Security Council on April 3: 1. What progress has been made in the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Iran on the issue of Soviet troop withdrawal? 2. Is the Soviet troop withdrawal from Iran conditional on other concessions? Under these circumstances, the problem resolved itself, but with the Soviet Union and Britain simultaneously forcing the border, the problem came again.

### Traffic Improvement Measures Decided: Pedestrians to Walk on the Right, Congested Roads in the Central District Designated for One-Way Traffic, Five Parking Lots Designated, Traffic Signs Added, to be Implemented from September 1

[Our News] The second traffic meeting convened by Mayor Wu was held at 3 pm yesterday in the City Hall conference room. Director of Public Utilities Zhao Cengyi, Director of Public Works Zhao Zukang, Deputy Director of the Police Bureau Yu Shuping, and directors of various sub-bureaus such as Huangpu, Lao Zha, and Xin Cheng attended. The following important decisions regarding the city's traffic problems were made at yesterday's meeting:

### Ten Measures

(1) The conference decided that the number of one-way traffic lines in the city should not be too many. The one-way traffic lines that have been decided are as follows: (A) North-South One-Way Traffic: (1) Sichuan Road for northbound traffic, (2) Henan Road for northbound traffic, (3) Jiangxi Road Bridge is abandoned and unused, and the north-south traffic is not continuous, so the traffic volume is reduced, and it can be changed to two-way traffic. (B) East-West One-Way Traffic: (1) Jiujiang Road for westbound traffic, (2) Hankou Road for eastbound traffic. (2) It was decided that the arrangement of various vehicles in the one-way traffic lines should be as follows: rickshaws must walk on the inner lane of the road, tricycles walk on the left side of the rickshaws, and motor vehicles walk on the left side of the tricycles. If cars want to overtake rickshaws, they must drive from the outer lane to maintain the fixed position of various vehicles. In addition, pedestrians walking on the sidewalks on both sides must also walk on the right. (3) Designated motor vehicle parking lots. These parking lots are rented from various groups or private individuals. In the future, vehicles must be concentrated in the parking lots to reduce congestion in the roads. The designated parking lots are as follows: (A) Zhongshan East 1st Road (i.e., the Bund) can park 200 to 300 vehicles, (B) Suzhou Road China Garden can park 200 vehicles, (C) Hankou Road Jiangxi Road intersection can park 70 vehicles, (D) Fuzhou Road Henan Road (the open space behind the current City Hall) can park 40 vehicles, (E) Henan Road Bridge can park 70 vehicles. The use of the above parking lots may be subject to reasonable fees. (4) The driving hours of heavy vehicles (tiger cars, dump trucks, etc.) are stipulated as follows: (A) In the central area main roads such as Nanjing Road, traffic is not allowed from 8 am to 12 noon and from 2 pm to 6 pm. (B) In other roads, traffic is prohibited from 8 am to 12 noon. The congestion situation in these roads has been investigated, and the afternoon is worse than the morning. (C) Military trucks not obeying the rules are one of the reasons for traffic congestion. It is now decided to ask the 33rd Gendarmerie Regiment, the US military headquarters, and the Garrison Command to assist in enforcing traffic discipline. (5) At each intersection along Nanjing Road, it was decided to delineate pedestrian lanes and parking lines to allow pedestrians to cross the road safely and to easily identify vehicles that violate the rules. The eight intersections decided to be delineated are: (1) Nanjing Road Xizang Road intersection, (2) Nanjing Road Zhejiang Road intersection, (3) Nanjing Road Fuzhou Road intersection, (4) Nanjing Road Tibet Road intersection, (5) Nanjing Road Henan Road intersection, (6) Nanjing Road Jiangxi Road intersection, (7) Nanjing Road Sichuan Road intersection, (8) Nanjing Road Zhongshan East 1st Road intersection. Separation lines will be added to the entrances and exits of one-way traffic lines. The ones decided are Sichuan Road, Henan Road, Jiujiang Road, Hankou Road, etc. (6) Add traffic signs: add various traffic signs such as "no parking," "parking area," and "one-way traffic to the south or north" on the roads. (7) Add traffic lights: add traffic lights at important intersections, such as Sichuan Road Bridge, Tianhou Palace Bridge, Fujian Road, Sima Road intersection, Henan Road Bridge, etc. A total of 14 places need to be added. (8) Eliminate roadside vendors: Vendors are not allowed to set up stalls along the road outside the designated areas. The Police Bureau will strictly enforce this from today, and the penalty measures are as follows: the first offense is a fine of 5,000 yuan, the second offense is a fine of 10,000 yuan, and the third offense is confiscation. (9) The implementation method of the entire traffic plan: Each relevant bureau, the Public Utilities Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, the Police Bureau, and the Huangpu and Lao Zha sub-bureaus will send two representatives. To speed up the process, each direct agency will be notified by telephone to execute the plan, without going through official documents. (10) All of the above resolutions will be implemented from September 1. However, there may be delays due to various material limitations. However, at yesterday's meeting, Mayor Wu repeatedly and firmly stated that the implementation of the traffic improvement plan is urgent. Therefore, Director of Public Utilities Zhao Cengyi and others have decided to overcome all obstacles and implement it as soon as possible, so that the city's traffic can be improved as soon as possible.

### Acceptance Work Investigation Team Announces: Investigation of the Case of Wang Zhuchen, Definite Evidence of Encroachment and Theft of Materials, Central Trust Bureau Suspected of Negligence

According to the announcement of the Enemy and Puppet Property Acceptance Work Investigation Team of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District, the investigation of the case of Wang Zhuchen, a Japanese merchant of No. 10 Beihai Ning Road, encroaching on and stealing enemy property from the Changdao Repair Factory, is as follows: The team received a confidential report on July 27, which stated that No. 10 Beihai Ning Road was originally the Japanese merchant Changdao Repair Factory. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was the largest automobile repair factory in Shanghai. There were many enemy properties left behind. When the victory came last year, the Shanghai Garrison Command and the Shanghai Municipal Government accepted the management of the enemy and Weili materials. In May of this year, when the Japanese merchant Changdao was about to return to his country, a Wang Zhuchen suddenly accepted it without authorization, rebranded it as the Xinyou Company Automobile Repair Factory, and gradually stole a large number of valuable materials inside by car. It has been secretly reported to the Enemy and Puppet Property Treatment Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District, but it has not been completely dealt with, so another secret report was made.

After receiving the report, the country paid great attention and was studying thorough investigation methods. It also received the second and third secret reports, stating that Wang Zhuchen had been transporting about 30 to 40 tires, about 2,200 oil pump pipes, about 2,000 large and small cylinder beds, about 4,300 cracker blue rings, about 500 inner tires, and a truck of auto parts every day, and was still continuing to steal them, etc. The team considered the case to be serious. After discussion by various committees, it decided to investigate. Therefore, it first requested the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Property Treatment Bureau to transfer the entire case file. After reviewing it, it was found that the bureau's handling of this case was only about a part of the fixed equipment of the factory, which had been transferred to the Central Trust Bureau for sealing. The enemy assets left inside were not investigated and dealt with at the same time. The handling of the case was inevitably negligent. Therefore, a letter was sent to the bureau for questioning at any time. Also, after reviewing the original file, the investigators reported on June 20. Why was it delayed until July 8 to inform Wang Zhuchen of the Songhu Garrison Command to exchange houses with Wu Tianxiang and seal them up? Why didn't they pay attention to and deal with other enemy relics at the same time? There was a suspicion of avoiding the important and taking the light. On July 19, Wu Tianxiang urged to remove the materials, but the request was delayed and ignored. It was not until August 6, when the team investigated, that the Central Trust Bureau was notified to send personnel to take over. The personnel responsible for handling this case were particularly negligent. Therefore, the bureau was requested to stop the leakage on the one hand and to trace the stolen enemy assets and the custody of the remaining enemy assets on the other hand. At the same time, committee members Zhang and Wu personally went to the Garrison Command to interview Commander Xuan to inquire about the case. Later, they sent a commissioner to work with the personnel in charge of the Enemy and Puppet Property Treatment Bureau of Suzhou and Anhui District. After the Songhu Garrison Command investigated, Wang Zhuchen was not a staff member of the department. The department's files only concerned the house issue. Wang Zhuchen had requested the department to apply to the House Allocation Committee for the allocation of houses for repairing cars. The Garrison Command also sent inspectors disguised to investigate the situation of Wang Zhuchen leaking enemy assets. Based on the comprehensive investigation results from all aspects, it could be confirmed that Wang Zhuchen had encroached on and stolen enemy assets. Therefore, a letter was immediately sent to the Hongkou Sub-bureau requesting that Wang Zhuchen be detained first. The entire case file, along with the documents, was sent to the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate for legal investigation.

### Letter Sent to the Court for Legal Investigation

Respectfully, according to repeated confidential reports, it was mentioned that after the Songhu Garrison Command accepted the Japanese merchant Changdao Repair Factory at No. 10 Beihai Ning Road last winter, Wang Zhuchen suddenly accepted the factory unconditionally in May of this year and used many degenerate Japanese Nazis to set up shareholders and expand the business after rebranding and continuously stealing a large number of valuable materials to prepare, and requested a thorough investigation. Based on this, after reading the content in detail, the case was serious. The Enemy and Puppet Property Treatment Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District was ordered to transfer the case file. Committee members Zhang and Wu went to take over the remaining land property, and the commissioner was dispatched to go to the Garrison Command with the Enemy and Puppet Property Treatment Bureau to read the files and handle them. If necessary, Wang Zhuchen can be detained first, all of which are on file. Based on the comprehensive investigation results and the handling of this case by the Enemy and Puppet Property Treatment Bureau, Wang Zhuchen has a serious suspicion of encroaching on and stealing enemy assets. In order to prevent continued theft and thoroughly investigate the truth of the case, in addition to sending a letter to the Hongkou Sub-bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau to detain Wang Zhuchen first, and sending letters to the Enemy and Puppet Property Treatment Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to investigate the relevant case files, and forwarding them to your court, the relevant documents of this case are enclosed with the letter. Please investigate and handle them in accordance with the law, and hope to be informed of the handling situation.

### An Interview with Mr. Abend: Talking About China's War, He Coughs Greatly

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] "When I first arrived in Shanghai, the doctors all said I wouldn't live long, at most only a month or two. But after coming here, and letting go of all my worries, I actually got better." Mr. Abend, leaning back in a chair by the window, with a "Pocket Book," specially printed for the American military, spread open on his lap, said this with a smile.

Mr. Abend indeed looked much better. His silvery white hair was neatly combed, his complexion was rosy, and his spirits were quite good. Although he still coughed often when speaking, and his right hand still frequently rested on his left chest, his "coughing fits" had lessened considerably compared to the several times I had visited him in the past month or two.

He said with a smile, "Didn't you say in the newspaper that I came to Shanghai to see 'one last glimpse'? I didn't expect that when you came to see me this time, I would still be doing so well." I said that probably doctors' words, from ancient times to the present, shouldn't be taken too seriously, otherwise George Bernard Shaw wouldn't constantly joke with doctors in his plays.

Mr. Abend suddenly scrutinized me for a moment and slowly said, "Do you really think so?"

The air was a bit heavy, so we talked about politics.

When it was mentioned that some people advocated inviting Britain to join in mediating the China problem, he seemed somewhat incredulous, repeatedly asking which news agency had reported the news. I said, regardless of the accuracy of the news, if Britain were actually invited, would he think Britain would participate? I said, "Mr. Abend is an observer who deeply understands the situation in China, surely he has some opinions."

He said, "What can I observe in a sickroom? However, Britain is probably busy enough with a Turkish problem and a Palestinian problem, isn't it?"

As soon as we touched on the current state of affairs in China, with war clouds looming, Mr. Abend began to cough greatly!

The air was filled with coughing sounds. I thought it would be better to do something else—so I asked him to take a photo.

I knew that Mr. Abend was not very willing to have his picture taken, but yesterday he actually made an exception and agreed. Even the nurse was surprised and said incredulously, "He agreed to have his picture taken today?"

Mr. Abend is an extremely resolute person. Without resolution, he wouldn't have come to China in such a seriously ill state. "Resolution" can create miracles in medicine, and I hope that this miracle will eventually overcome his terminal illness! (The photo is a recent portrait of Mr. Abend, taken by our newspaper)

### The Disposal Bureau Transfers Seized Properties for Review by the Investigation Team

The Soochow-Chekiang-Anhwei Enemy and Puppet Property Seizure Work Investigation Team has received over a hundred confidential reports since starting work in Shanghai, and they are currently processing them separately. A list of properties seized by the Soochow-Chekiang-Anhwei Region Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau has been compiled and sent to the team for review. Furthermore, Commissioners Wu Wang and Zhang Qingzhen are scheduled to personally inquire about the 1,156 warehouses seized in the city within the week, including the nature of the warehouses, the types of goods stored, the reasons for not opening them, and studying which organizations they should be returned to. All of these are within the scope of the investigation. It was rumored that the team would stop accepting confidential reports on the 24th of this month. However, Commissioner Zhang stated that this was purely a rumor, and the team will continue to accept confidential reports even after moving to Hangzhou and other places.

### German Nationals' Leftover Properties Transferred to the Disposal Bureau for Clearance

After German nationals in the city were concentrated for residence, and a portion of them were sent back to their country last month, all matters handled by the German Nationals Management Committee regarding properties left by German nationals have been separately transferred to the German Nationals Property Clearance Office of the Soochow-Chekiang-Anhwei Region Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau for specialized handling.

### More Suspects Arrested in the Counterfeit US Dollar Case

Yesterday, our reporter learned from the US military that after the US military, together with the Garrison Headquarters, arrested five suspects in the counterfeit US dollar manufacturing case, three more people were arrested that night. Five of them are White Russians. It is also learned that two more suspects in the case have been arrested by the authorities, and the case is currently under investigation.

### Checks Written with Ballpoint Pens Not Honored

The Shanghai financial community is paying close attention to the validity of checks written with ballpoint pens. They entrusted the Bankers Association to conduct a study, and the study concluded that according to banking regulations, checks must be written with a Chinese brush or an ink pen. Pencils cannot be used to write checks. Because the color of ballpoint pens is similar to that of carbon pencils, they should be treated as pencils, and checks written with them cannot be cashed. Furthermore, signatures on signature cards cannot be made with ballpoint pens when opening an account. The Shanghai Silver and Money Industries Association, concerned about business matters and to prevent check fraud, sent a circular to its members yesterday to standardize procedures.

### Authorities Strictly Prevent Petty Criminal Activity; Security Strengthened at US Military Barracks

According to sources, a large number of Communist troops are currently infiltrating the Kiangnan area, attempting to take the opportunity to damage telecommunications, transportation, and utilities in various places, in order to disturb the people's hearts and endanger local security. After receiving this information, the city authorities immediately ordered the city's major utilities companies to take strict precautions. After receiving the instructions, each company has added defensive works at key locations and dispatched employees to patrol day and night to prevent unforeseen events. After receiving reports that Communist troops were attempting to damage the telecommunications network, the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications specially requested that the garrisons along the Kiangsu-Chekiang-Anhwei routes provide substantial protection for the wires along the roads. Military units have also been dispatched by local garrison troops to protect telecommunications bureaus in various places. Considering the increasingly serious current situation, local authorities and central government agencies in Shanghai fear that petty criminals may take the opportunity to infiltrate and disrupt offices. Therefore, from yesterday onward, the entrances and exits of all agencies are strictly controlled, and the identities of those entering and exiting are carefully checked.

[Report from Our Newspaper] To avoid accidents, the US military stationed in Shanghai was ordered yesterday to refrain from going out after 7:00 PM. At the same time, sentries were posted at all entrances and exits of the barracks, and security was strengthened.

### Xu Liqiu, Huang Qingzhong, and Others, Four Traitors Sentenced to Imprisonment; Gui Gen's Case Concluded, Awaiting Verdict

In all of the above cases, all of the defendants' property, except for what is necessary for the living expenses of their families, will be confiscated.

Also, Gui Gen's case was concluded yesterday and is scheduled to be pronounced on the morning of the 22nd of this month.

### White Russian Impersonates Authority, Special Agent Extorts Money

Several cases were heard on the same day: (1) White Russian Panlin Alexander published articles in the Pylos magazine in the fall of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937) when the enemy attacked Shanghai, advocating for the enemy and opposing our war policy. In the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), he served as an employee of the intelligence bureau of the enemy's consulate in Shanghai. Kedinovich joined the enemy's secret intelligence agency and collected military goods and transported hardware and other materials to Annam for the enemy. Tetyesky was also an informant for the enemy's military police. The High Procuratorate jointly prosecuted the above three persons. Among them, Tetyesky is in custody, and the other two are out on bail. During yesterday's hearing, Panlin Alexander did not appear, and both Tetyesky and Kedinovich denied the charges. (2) Hu Chongmin, the chief of the seventh action team of the special high section of the judicial division of the puppet Shanghai Police Bureau, his deputy, Japanese national Takahashi Toshikio, informants Hu Jia, and detectives Ye Heshang, Sun Junbao, Zhang Kexun, Liu Qipei, and Li Yongkang, arrested Wang Ren in August of the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944) for demanding remittances without success, accusing him of being a member of Chongqing and torturing him. After the victory, Wang Ren filed a complaint with President Chiang, who transferred the case to the High Court for trial. Takahashi Toshikio was a war criminal and was handed over to the relevant authorities. Zhang Kexun is in custody, and Li Yongkang is out on bail. The rest are at large. During yesterday's hearing, both defendants denied the torture and other incidents. The plaintiff also appeared in court and testified about the events in detail. (3) The Lin Qinlin, Lin Wei, and Lin Li three brothers of "Ding Ji Company" were accused by Zheng and Ling Jian of buying greedy rice and grains, buying cotton, and selling soap, cigarettes, matches, candles, and daily necessities for the enemy. When there was a shortage of counterfeit money in the market, they bought cash for the enemy and purchased materials in the interior and occupied areas. The accuser testified about the process, and the defendant denied it. (4) Enemy secret agent Wang Qiugen. All of the above cases were postponed for further hearing.

### The Verdicts of the Rong Case Offenders Have Been Telephoned for Instructions; The Grain Loan and Jiang Cases are Awaiting Approval

Regarding the grain fraud case accepted by the Garrison Headquarters, although the military law office of the headquarters has conducted a clear inquiry and drafted a verdict, it can only be announced after being submitted to the higher authorities for approval. Chief Zeng told reporters yesterday that the case cannot be considered formally pronounced until it has been approved. The approval document for the case of Jiang Gongmei, the former captain of the Shanghai Gendarmerie, has not yet arrived. However, the verdicts for the offenders in the Rong Desheng case have been telegraphed for instructions and may be approved and executed soon.

### The First Batch of Fishing Vessels Arriving in Shanghai Will Set Sail for Fishing Next Month

The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) ordered 232 fishing vessels of over 60 tons to assist in the relief and revitalization of China's fishing industry.

### Jeep Overturns While Joyriding, Sixteen Children Injured

[Report from Our Newspaper] At 4:30 PM yesterday, a tragic incident occurred on the Guangfu Road bridge in western Shanghai when a jeep overturned, injuring as many as sixteen people on the spot. Qu Binsen, a driver from the 14th Division of the New Sixth Army, drove jeep number 16158 to Tanjia Du, north of Caojiadu in western Shanghai, yesterday afternoon to visit a friend. His friend, Luo Jinsong, a 21-year-old Shanghai native who is currently a coppersmith for UNRRA, borrowed the car for a joyride, carrying fifteen children from the neighborhood who were out for evening coolness, most of whom were children of Xinsha Factory workers. When the car reached the Xiguangfu Road bridge and attempted to turn onto Fuxing Road, it swerved too quickly to avoid an oncoming vehicle, causing it to overturn. Luo and fifteen children in the car were thrown out of the car, all of them were injured and bleeding profusely. The police on duty urgently summoned an ambulance and sent the injured and the car to the Tongren Second Hospital on Yidingpan Road for treatment. Eleven of them suffered minor injuries and were discharged after bandaging. The remaining five suffered serious injuries. Because the hospital had no spare beds, it only admitted two patients, Li Axing, 14 years old, and Wang Xindong, 10 years old. The other three were transferred to the Red Cross Hospital, namely Chen Kuanyu, 16 years old, Luo Chungen, 20 years old, and Mu Daoming, 16 years old. The culprit, Luo Jinsong, suffered minor injuries and is currently being interrogated by the Putuo Road Police Station.

### North Sea Ship Dispute Resolved; Passengers Disembark After Ticket Refunds

Estimated to Set Sail Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Taikoo Company's North Sea ship, originally scheduled to depart for Qingdao and Tianjin at noon on the 14th, was delayed due to passengers boarding the ship without permission, causing a dispute and preventing it from leaving the port on time. Yesterday, the manager of the company returned to customs to apply, and the customs authorities dispatched officers from the port police station at approximately 4:00 PM yesterday to persuade them to leave the ship. Fang and a dozen police officers went to the North Sea ship to persuade them to disembark. It was learned that some passengers had purchased tickets from the ticket offices in advance. The company and customs authorities summoned the ticket office representatives to inquire and ordered them to refund the tickets. At approximately 5:00 PM, several ticket offices brought money on board, redeemed the tickets, and the passengers disembarked one by one. Some passengers had already purchased berths on the ship and had to be refunded the berth fees before leaving, which caused some minor issues. Generally speaking, all passengers had disembarked by last night, and it is estimated that the ship can set sail today.

### Relieving Unemployed Workers: Work-for-Relief Planned

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Unemployed Workers Temporary Relief Committee has been established for ten months. Recently, the Executive Headquarters urgently needed to transport flour to the interior to relieve disaster victims, so the flour relief for unemployed workers could not be allocated in full. Therefore, the committee decided to close at the end of this month and transfer unfinished matters to other relevant agencies for continued handling. It is also learned that there are still more than 60,000 unemployed workers in the city. Recently, due to the sluggishness of industry and commerce, the number of unemployed workers has increased.

### Dahua Airlines to Choose Auspicious Day for Opening After Trading

According to insiders, China's aviation industry is still in the developing stage, and it has not been clearly determined whether it will be state-owned or privately operated.

### Verdict on Gold Bar Theft Case: Chen Yuansheng Sentenced to Life Imprisonment; Wu Minggang, Chen Youqing, et al. Receive Prison Terms; Stolen Gold Bar and Legal Tender to Be Fully Recovered According to Law

[Our Report] The Central Bank gold bar theft case, previously concluded through a preliminary hearing, was pronounced by Judge Zhong Xianda of the Second Criminal Tribunal at 12:00 noon yesterday. Main text: Chen Yuansheng is sentenced to life imprisonment for continuous embezzlement of public property, with lifelong deprivation of civil rights. Wu Minggang is sentenced to seven months imprisonment for harboring stolen goods, Chen Youqing is sentenced to nine months imprisonment for knowingly purchasing stolen goods, Shi Xianglong is sentenced to five months imprisonment for receiving stolen goods, Yu Shiyang is sentenced to three months imprisonment for harboring stolen goods, and Wang Shumei is found not guilty. One gold bar weighing over 453 taels and a check for 5,358,493.80 legal tender yuan shall be recovered.

The main culprit, Chen Yuansheng, wore a checkered short-sleeved shirt and trousers with a shaved head and black shoes yesterday. Upon hearing the verdict, he lowered his head and remained silent, and was escorted back to prison by bailiffs. Among the other defendants who were out on bail, only Yu Shiyang was present in court.

Reasons for the Judgment

The full text states: "The defendant Chen Yuansheng has already confessed to the facts of the crime during the interrogation. This confession is consistent with the statements made by Pan Jia, Yu Shiyang, and others, which is sufficient to prove the facts. The defendant should be punished according to law. However, considering that the motives for embezzling public property were based on financial difficulties and were carried out continuously, although there are several acts, they should still be considered as one continuous crime. The defendant was living with his brother, so he should have had no worries and should have been content and self-sufficient, without resorting to wrongdoing. However, he was addicted to gambling and pleasure-seeking, and his monthly salary was not enough, so he spent lavishly and suffered from failed speculation, which led him to steal and sell public property. Although this may be considered a desperate situation, it was self-inflicted. The defendant fled to Hangzhou and continued to indulge in pleasure and spend recklessly, which shows his true character. Furthermore, the defendant was unwilling to accept poverty and first attempted to make a fortune through speculation, and then continuously stole property under his custody in his official capacity. Considering the circumstances, the crime is unforgivable and a severe penalty should be imposed as a warning. As for the defendant's claim that he was only an employee of the Central Bank, since the defendant was a person engaged in public service according to laws and regulations, there is no need to debate whether he is a public official. The defendant embezzled public property in his capacity as a public official, so he should be charged with corruption. Furthermore, the stolen gold bar and the check for 5,358,493.80 yuan should be recovered from the defendants according to law."

Wu Minggang's Part in Harboring Stolen Goods

During the interrogation, the defendant Wu Minggang did not deny receiving a gold bar stolen from the Central Bank by Chen Yuansheng. However, he argued that the deal was arranged by Pan Jia by phone, and then Yang Desheng, deputy section chief of the Shanghai City Bank's business department, and Wang Shuhai, manager of the Xinda Bank, jointly delivered it. Therefore, he did not suspect it was stolen goods. However, the Ministry of Finance had already explicitly prohibited the use of funds as collateral, and the Ministry of Finance had issued a statement to this effect in the Dagong Bao in April. The defendant knew that banks were not allowed to use gold as collateral, but he rashly did so, which was wrong. Moreover, the gold bar was engraved with the English words "Central Bank of Manchuria," so it was obvious that it was a thing received from the enemy and puppet regime. Such materials could not be possessed or traded by ordinary people. However, the defendant was greedy for profit and recklessly took the risk, which is unforgivable. Although he claimed that he did not open the paper package and inspect it at the time, the mortgage of a gold bar is not like an ordinary mortgage. The defendant did not even inspect the collateral worth over 60 million yuan before rashly accepting it, which is unbelievable. It was found that the defendant was acquainted with Pan Jia, but had no contact with Wang Shumei and others. Therefore, he must have opened the gold bar delivered by them to verify its authenticity. This is consistent with general trading practices. Although the defendant repeatedly denied knowing that he was receiving stolen goods, based on the above analysis, his claim is not credible. It is clear that the defendant is a businessman who was greedy for a small profit and thus fell into the trap of the law. Considering the circumstances, he deserves to be punished leniently as a minor warning.

Chen Youqing's Part in Knowingly Purchasing Stolen Goods

It was found that the defendant Chen Youqing admitted to buying a gold bar stolen from the Central Bank by Chen Yuansheng through Pan Jia and others on May 4th of this year. Although he claimed that he did not knowingly purchase stolen goods, the gold bar was engraved with the English words "Central Bank of Manchuria," so it was obvious that it was a thing received from the puppet organization, which could not be possessed or traded by ordinary people. The defendant falsely claimed that he did not examine the gold bar in detail at the time to defend himself against the charge of knowingly purchasing stolen goods. However, the purchase of a gold bar worth over 70 million yuan is not a trivial matter. He must have carefully examined it and distinguished its authenticity before making the transaction. The defendant knew that the seller could not possess the gold bar, but he still bought it, which is obviously unforgivable. The fact that the defendant delivered it to Shi Xianglong for melting after buying it further proves that the defendant knew that the gold bar was stolen. Because there are many money shops and banks in Shanghai that could buy gold bars. If the defendant needed money urgently, he could have resold it to someone else. There was no need to deliver it to Shi Xianglong for melting on the same day. Considering the circumstances, the defendant wanted to destroy the evidence of his crime of knowingly purchasing stolen goods, which is enough to convict him and should be punished according to law as a warning.

Shi Xianglong's Part in Receiving Stolen Goods

The defendant Shi Xianglong admitted to receiving the gold bar delivered by Chen Youqing on May 4th of this year and melting it immediately, obtaining over 70,000 yuan for melting it. However, he argued that he did not know the gold bar was stolen because he did not understand English. However, Shanghai is a hub for domestic and foreign trade, and even apprentices in small shops can speak fluent English. It is not credible that the defendant, as a manager, claims not to know English. Furthermore, he claimed that he was only 35 years old and was educated in a private school and did not receive modern education, so he does not understand English, which is also unbelievable. Since the gold bar is not something that ordinary people can possess, and it is engraved with the words "Central Bank of Manchuria," it is obvious that it is a thing received from the puppet organization. However, the defendant was greedy for the melting fee and recklessly received it for melting, so he should be held responsible for receiving stolen goods without any doubt.

Yu Shiyang's Part in Harboring Stolen Goods

It was found that the defendant Yu Shiyang harbored four packages of Class C national unified bonds with a face value of 960,000 yuan for Chen Yuansheng on May 18th of this year. These bonds were recovered by the Central Bank after the incident. He admitted to these facts, but claimed that he did not know the bonds were stolen. However, the defendant was not a stranger to Chen Yuansheng and knew his financial situation. Chen Yuansheng was only an assistant employee of the Central Bank, so it is obvious that he would not have such a huge amount of bonds. Moreover, the four packages of bonds were sealed with the seals of the Central Bank and Chen Yuansheng, which clearly showed that they were not Chen Yuansheng's personal property. The defendant knew that these bonds were stored in the Central Bank's warehouse, but he still harbored them, so he should be held responsible for his crime without any doubt. Considering that he was limited by friendship, he committed a crime. Considering the circumstances, he deserves to be punished leniently as a minor warning.

Wang Shumei's Part in Transporting Stolen Goods

The indictment alleges that the defendant Wang Shumei is suspected of transporting stolen goods because she acted on behalf of Pan Jia on April 24th of this year and signed a loan contract with Wu Minggang, the manager of the Chongqing Bank's Shanghai branch, and carried the gold bar together with Yang Desheng to deliver it. Therefore, she had the intention of transporting stolen goods. However, the defendant stated that she was invited by Pan to sign the contract on behalf of him. Because a friend said that gold could be used as collateral, and the Chongqing Bank could not provide a mortgage in a private name according to the precedent, she used the Xinda Bank opened by the defendant as the mortgagor, and did not know that the gold bar was stolen. The defendant's statements are consistent with Pan Jia's statements and are credible. Pan's invitation to the defendant to act as the mortgagor did not mention the source of the gold bar to the defendant. His intention was to use the defendant's Xinda Bank as the mortgagor. The defendant did not open the gold bar during the transport, and Yang Desheng also confirmed that he accompanied her. Although the defendant should not have been so careless, since she did not know it was stolen goods, her carrying the gold bar to the Qing Bank for delivery should not be considered a crime of transporting stolen goods. In addition, there is no other definite evidence to prove that the defendant committed a crime. According to the legal principle that the purpose of convicting a crime is to discover the truth, it is not appropriate to convict her.

Based on the above conclusions, in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 291 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 1, paragraph 1 of the Special Criminal Litigation Regulations, Articles 3, paragraph 2 and 7 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Corruption, Article 349, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and Article 293, paragraph 1 of the same Code of Criminal Procedure, the judgment is as stated in the main text.

### Simplified Normal Schools Enrolling New Students; Age Should Be Limited

Should Be Young People Who Are Fully 15 Years of Age

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The Ministry of Education believes that simplified normal schools were originally set up temporarily to promote national education and increase the number of teachers. They should enroll young people who have graduated from elementary school and are at least 15 years old, and after three or four years of training, they should be assigned to serve in national schools in various districts. Age should be limited in advance. If education departments or bureaus in various provinces and cities, or national normal schools running simplified normal schools, feel that enrollment is difficult, they can enroll junior high school graduates to run a one-year simplified normal school program. In addition, regarding the various border normal schools, when enrolling new border teachers this summer, the age requirement should be strictly enforced, and young people under the age of 15 should not be enrolled.

### Zhao Naichuan Discusses the Recent Situation of the Peking University Law School

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] Zhao Naichuan, acting dean of the Peking University Law School, recently told reporters about the recent situation of the school: The school is divided into three departments: Law, Politics, and Economics. The Sociology Department belongs to the College of Liberal Arts. This department is like the Psychology Department, which is sometimes included in the College of Liberal Arts and sometimes in the Law School. Yan Shutang is the chairman of the Law Department, Qian Duansheng is the chairman of the Political Science Department, and Zhao Naichuan also serves as the chairman of the Economics Department. The faculty of the three departments is strong. The Economics Department alone has ten experts, eight of whom have been confirmed: financial economist Qin Zan, monetary and banking expert Zhou Zuoren, statistician Yang Ximeng, economic history expert Zhou Binglin, economic theory expert Zhao Naichuan, and accountant Song Zuonan. The Law Department has ten professors and the Political Science Department has seven. In terms of students, there are about 250 students in the Political Science Department, 200 in the Law Department, and over 400 in the Economics Department. With the addition of new students, the Law School will have nearly 1,000 students. The Peking University Red Building will now be divided between the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Law. Zhao continued: The Law School focuses on academic research. Although there is a Political Science Department, political activities are not allowed during study. Students will be asked to do more reading reports to build an academic foundation. Regarding the Law Department, Zhao specifically pointed out that it is not enough to increase the number of years of graduation in order to achieve gains in legal theory. It requires at least six years. Therefore, he advocates the establishment of an independent law school. In this way, political science and economics will become a college of political economy, which is in line with the opinions of the recent Higher Education Conference held in Beijing.

### Uniform Fee Collection Method for Provincial Middle Schools in Taiwan

In addition to tuition being waived across the board, the miscellaneous fee is NT$15 (equivalent to 4,050 legal tender), the textbook fee is NT$30 (equivalent to 9,100 legal tender), and the physical education fee is NT$10 (equivalent to 2,700 legal tender).

### New Jianzhong Middle School Relocates to New Premises

[Our Newspaper] New Jianzhong Middle School was originally run by the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Education.

After the victory, it returned to Shanghai and organized a board of directors to actively develop the school. Because the original site on Route Paul Henry was too small to expand, it has now moved to the new site at No. 35 Changning Road (formerly Route Père Hilaire), east of Zhao Feng Park, and has begun operations, including the recruitment of new students with boarding facilities, and adjustments to the faculty.

Civil Affairs Briefing

### Household Affairs Personnel in Each District Must Not Be Transferred Easily - Municipal Government Issues Order to All District Offices for Compliance

The Municipal Government issued an order to all district offices yesterday, stating that household affairs are not only complicated but also require special skills. Therefore, the personnel in charge must have perseverance and rich experience. The directors of the household affairs sections in each district are the actual responsible personnel for household affairs in the entire district and should be carefully selected. However, in the past, each district often transferred household affairs personnel easily due to the change of district chiefs, which affected the efficiency of household affairs. Furthermore, the replacement of household affairs personnel often required them to report to work in advance, hoping to create a fait accompli so that the superior authorities had to recognize it, which was even more inappropriate and should be strictly corrected. Three measures are hereby formulated as follows: (1) In the future, household affairs personnel in each district who work hard and achieve outstanding results shall be protected and shall not be dismissed directly due to changes in district chiefs. (2) When each district replaces household affairs personnel, it shall select those with household affairs experience and report to the Municipal Government for approval, and shall go to the competent department of the Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government in advance to wait for inquiries. (3) In the second-class district offices, the directors of the household affairs sections are concurrently held by the chief secretary, and some are concurrently held by the director of the civil affairs section. It is found that the chief secretary and the director of the civil affairs section have very heavy official duties and cannot take care of them at the same time. In the future, the director of the household affairs section should be a full-time position. The affairs of the culture or economy section are simpler and can be held concurrently, so as to be reasonable and not affect the establishment. In addition to separate orders, the above three points are hereby ordered to be strictly complied with by the district.

### The Director of the Household Affairs Section in the First District Performs Poorly - Municipal Government Specifically Censures

The Municipal Government recently investigated that the household registration statistical tables and the statistical tables for filling out national identity cards for June in the first, fifth, tenth, eleventh, twenty-fifth, thirtieth, and thirty-first districts were overdue for one month and have not yet been filled out and reported, which clearly shows that the directors of the household affairs sections in the districts are not working hard, and they are specifically censured. The district offices are also limited to send the above statistics within three days.

### Nineteenth District Examines the Work of Bao Secretaries

The forty-one full-time Bao secretaries in the Nineteenth District, who were previously qualified by the Municipal Government examination, have been employed for nearly half a year. The district office usually holds a work review meeting for Bao secretaries every Saturday afternoon. In order to understand the performance of each Bao secretary, the district office sent Chief Secretary Meng and Director Zhao of the Civil Affairs Section to each Bao to inspect and assess their work. Meng gave detailed guidance on promoting local autonomy and enriching the equipment of the Bao office.

In addition, the district office held a symposium for Bao chiefs and Jia chiefs at the Hudong Grand Theater at 10:00 AM yesterday. More than 600 Bao chiefs, Jia chiefs, and Bao secretaries attended the meeting. District Chief Tian was absent due to other important official duties, and Deputy District Chief Meng Xinmin presided over the meeting, reporting on major cases such as promoting national education, eliminating illiteracy, and the police branch's handling of the vocational census. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM.

### Fourth District Rechecks Household Registration

The Fourth District (Penglai) District Office in this city, because the people's houses destroyed in the district during the occupation have now been rebuilt one after another, resulting in frequent changes in household registration and a sharp increase in immigration. In order to facilitate the transcription of household registration, the recheck of household registration began last month. Except for the 16th Bao and 52nd Bao, which were returned for correction, the rechecks of other Bao have been completed, and all the forms have been reported to the Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government yesterday.

### Citizens of the Fourteenth District Petition to Open Hongxing Road

Wang Gongyu and other citizens of the Fourteenth District (Zhabei) in this city yesterday submitted a petition to the Municipal Government, requesting the opening of Hongxing Road in Zhabei, removing the accumulated materials from the road, restoring the original road before the war, and facilitating traffic.

### Cai Guodong Resigns Concurrently

Cai Guodong, a representative of the district residents in the Twelfth District of this city, resigned his concurrent position on the grounds that he was elected as a member of the first Municipal Council and could not hold the position of representative of the district residents concurrently according to law. The district office has reported the request to the Municipal Government yesterday, and intends to replace the vacant position of representative of the district residents with the alternate candidate Liu Fupei.

### Questions and Answers on Household Registration Laws and Regulations (Continued)

(7) Question: The age of the people in the registration book changes year by year. Can the example of changing occupation and education level be used to attach a signature?

Answer: The registration book has a registration date to be verified, which is convenient for calculation, and there is no need to attach a signature.

(8) Question: Which application form should be used for the change of registration of the head of the household and family members, the household registration application form or the personal registration application form?

Answer: Use the household registration application form.

(9) Question: The age column of the personal registration application form is too small. Can only the year be filled in without filling in the month?

Answer: Only fill in the full year in the age column without filling in the zero month. If it is less than one year old, draw "〇" in the age column.

(10) Question: Where should the application for marriage registration be made?

Answer: The application should be made to the household registration director of the current residence at the time of marriage.

(11) Question: When a household wants to transfer its original place of residence to another county or city, should it only apply for transfer registration or should it apply for registration separately?

Answer: When applying for transfer registration, whether it is removal or registration, both are transfer registration applications.

(12) Question: Article 103, Paragraph 1 of the Household Registration Law stipulates that when accepting a transfer registration application, the household registration director shall send a copy of the new household registration to the supervising agency. Article 16 of the Implementation Rules stipulates that the county and city governments shall review and verify the copy and re-enter it into the registration book. The two regulations are different. Is it still necessary for the township offices to send a copy of the new household registration?

Answer: Please handle it according to Article 16 of the revised Household Registration Law Implementation Rules, and no additional copy will be made.

(13) Question: Does the person referred to in Article 93, Paragraph 2 of the Household Registration Law, mean the person who is temporarily dispatched to send the application form, or the person who has the responsibility and obligation to send it?

Answer: The so-called person who sends it refers to the person who has the responsibility and obligation to send it. For example, in accordance with the regulations for abandoned children, the discoverer or the police station that receives the discoverer's report shall apply for birth registration within 24 hours. The sending refers to the discoverer or the police station that receives the discoverer's report, not the messenger temporarily dispatched by the discoverer to send the application form, or the police station that receives the discoverer's report, to send the application form.

### Wartime Savings Paid Back at a Thousand Times, Public Bonds Black Market Creates Another Storm, Unified Internal Bonds Highest Rise to 1,700

[Our Newspaper] Public bonds suddenly rose yesterday. The matter of deposits in the Four Banks Savings Association has been brewing for a long time. Now that the court has ruled that it should be returned at a thousand times, it has attracted attention from all parties. After being stirred up by major players in the industry, outside speculative funds have been attracted again, and buying momentum has suddenly become strong. Unified Class C bonds started at 900 yuan, with demand exceeding supply, and suddenly rose to 1,700 yuan. Many bulls in the industry took profits and saw a callback after the high, but because retail investors maintained it from time to time, there was a major struggle in the middle. Finally, due to illusory prospects, it fell back to around 1,200 yuan and then stabilized. As a result, it rose sharply by 500 yuan compared with the previous closing. Class A and B bonds rose by 290 yuan, Class D bonds rose by 410 yuan, and Class E bonds also rose by 480 yuan. It is necessary to pay special attention to whether the government's issuance of public bonds and the bank's absorption of deposits can be discussed together. The entire process of the recent court judgment in the case of Chen Jilin suing the Four Banks Savings Association is recorded below:

Loss of Savings After Currency Inflation

During the war, the value of the currency fell frequently. Generally, the time deposit account holders of banks could not use their deposits due to the time limit. When the principal and interest were settled at maturity, the absolute amount of legal tender obtained was higher than when the deposit was made. However, the internal purchasing power of the deposit was only one-thousandth of the time when the deposit was made. Should the bank give the time deposit account holder a silver compensation for the depreciation of the currency value, or should it still pay the original principal and interest? This issue has long been the focus of discussion among the general public. Recently, this issue has aroused more attention in the financial community because a court case has occurred in this city.

Chen Jilin Sues the Four Banks Savings Association

Chen Jilin deposited 2,000 yuan of legal tender in the Four Banks Savings Association on May 6, 1940, as a long-term savings deposit for five years. The deposit matured on May 6, 1945, and the principal and interest have not yet been settled. Chen believes that during this six-year period, drastic changes have taken place in the social economy, and the cost of living index has increased by about 4,000 times. If it is still paid according to the original amount, it is obviously unfair. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit with the court, believing that according to the provisions of Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Repatriation and the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan Zi No. 3018, the defendant should be responsible for increasing the payment, and requested that the defendant increase the payment of the plaintiff's 2,000 yuan deposit and its interest by 3,000 times.

Court Orders Payment at a Thousand Times

Main text of the court judgment: The defendant shall increase the payment of the plaintiff's long-term savings deposit of 2,000 yuan of legal tender and its interest by 1,000 times. The main points of the court's reasoning for this case are: The plaintiff made a long-term savings deposit for an agreed five years, and the principal and interest were not settled after maturity. During this long war period, the economic situation changed drastically. It was neither the responsibility of the plaintiff nor could it be foreseen by the plaintiff at the time. Based on the regulations cited by the defendant and the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan, it is credible that the defendant should be responsible for increasing the payment. However, after the defendant received the savings deposit, it did take part of the deposit as working capital, and the remaining deposits were either used to purchase public bonds and other bonds as collateral, or invested in real estate to stabilize it. After that, the income was used for various activities and utilization. Although the public bonds suffered considerable losses due to the Ministry of Finance's method of repaying the principal at par value, the amount of currency in other investments has greatly increased. It is necessary to make an additional payment of 1,000 times to maintain fairness.

Regulations on Increasing or Decreasing Payment Should Also Apply to Banks

The court also believes that the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan Zi No. 3018 and Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Repatriation are generally applicable regulations for increasing or decreasing payments. Since there is no explicit provision for excluding banks, it should be applied. Moreover, the measures of the Ministry of Finance submitted by the defendant are the measures for converting and paying counterfeit savings certificates and legal tender, and there is no provision prohibiting banks from increasing payments. Even if the Ministry of Finance has measures that conflict with the regulations, there is no room for applying them in the judicial arena. Banks can obtain huge profits by using the funds of depositors. Depositors watch the value depreciate due to long-term freezing. If it is not increased according to the regulations, how can it be considered fair? Based on the above legal arguments, the plaintiff's claim in this case is partly justified and partly unjustified, and should be approved and dismissed separately. The judgment is made in accordance with Article 79 of the Civil Procedure Law.

Financial Community Believes the Impact is Too Serious

The reporter asked the financial community for their opinions on this matter. They believe that this issue affects the general financial community and is very serious in nature. The government has not yet established a method for how banks should repay pre-war time deposits. Now the court has ruled that time deposits should be paid 1,000 times more, which has made the banks at a loss as to what to do. They believe that the bank's loans and deposit reserve funds have not increased by multiples compared with before the war. The Ministry of Finance has paid the original value of pre-war public bonds. The Central Savings Association's clearing of old savings deposits is also calculated at the old value. Therefore, they expressed that they could not accept the court's ruling.

### Two Important Reference Articles in the Judgment

(1) Main Points of Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 3018

Depositing money in a bank is for the purpose of preserving the value of money. The nature of the contract is a consumption deposit. The so-called preservation of the value of money refers to the legal value of preserving money. If silver coins or legal tender are deposited, the bank shall return the same amount of legal tender. Even if the economic value of the legal tender is low, it cannot be said that the obligation to preserve has been violated. However, if the law has special provisions on the scope of its repayment obligation, it shall not be excluded from its application because it has not violated the obligation to preserve. Consumption deposits shall be subject to the provisions on consumption loans in accordance with Article 602 of the Civil Law. Since Article 11 and Article 20, Paragraph 2 of the Supplementary Regulations for Civil Litigation in Extraordinary Times have special provisions on the scope of the repayment obligation for consumption loans, they cannot be excluded from their application in the event of requesting repayment of deposits. Bank loans are essentially consumption loans, and the event of requesting repayment of loans can also be handled according to this special provision. The interpretation of Yuan Jie Zi No. 2885 should not be changed.

(2) Original Text of Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Repatriation

If, after the establishment of a legal act, due to reasons not attributable to a normal person, the circumstances change and are unforeseeable at the time, and it is clearly unfair to base it on its original effect, the court shall fairly determine and render a judgment to increase or decrease the payment or change other original effects.

### Firm Gold Certificates

Yesterday, gold certificates continued to weaken. There was a lack of momentum for an increase. The opening price in the morning was around 1.95 million, and the high price once rebounded to 1.956 million. However, soon there was a flow of selling, and buyers remained on the sidelines. Prices gradually declined slightly. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 6 or 7 units, and the price dropped to 1.94 million. After that, morale was low. Money exchange businesses also engaged in cutthroat selling. At noon, the price fell back to 1.935 million, and then stabilized slightly. In the afternoon, the situation stabilized somewhat. US dollars provided considerable support, and there was a slight rebound. However, the final price was still 2,000 lower than the previous closing. Gold ornaments and silver bullion remained unchanged. Silver dollars declined slightly. The unofficial interest rate on silver was rampant, with rates ranging from 9 fen to 1 jiao 2 fen.

Foreign currencies continued to weaken. US dollars opened in the morning at 2,560 yuan for sale. After opening, the trend gradually shifted from stable to loose. The gold market declined, lacking support. At noon, it fell below 2,540 yuan. In the afternoon, there were some buyers stockpiling for future use, and a slight rebound was reported. The final price was up slightly by 5 yuan from the previous closing. Hong Kong banknotes were stable with multiple transactions, with asking prices ranging from a mid-level of 668 yuan down to 660 yuan. In the end, it still stood around 665 yuan, resulting in a slight decrease of 1 yuan from the previous closing. The Hong Kong exchange rate, due to Shanghai telegrams, rose to 181.5 yuan. Yesterday, it was sold at 552 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was 663 yuan. The British exchange rate had offers at 8,840 yuan. The US exchange rate remained unchanged.

### 100,000 Bags of Flour Produced, Actual Sales Only 30,000 Bags

The Association Again Requests Permission to Export

Currently, there is a surplus of flour production in this city. The Fourth District Flour Industry Association had previously requested the Ministry of Food to transport and sell flour to other locations or for the Ministry of Food to purchase it. The Ministry of Food replied that it was acting on President Song's telegraphic order, which prohibited reporting for transit. Furthermore, the food situation in Shanghai had not yet emerged from emergency times, and the transit of flour should still be prohibited. As for the prohibition of wheat transit, there was currently no need. The Flour Industry Association believed that if this policy was not changed, the current wheat loan would inevitably suffer losses, and the wheat loan would become a major problem. Therefore, it earnestly requested the Four Joint Offices to submit the matter to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry to prohibit wheat transit in the shortest possible time or lift the flour ban. According to people in the flour industry, if raw wheat could be exported, prices would inevitably rise. If the transport of flour to other locations was prohibited, sales would stagnate, and prices would inevitably fall. The Shanghai market's monthly actual sales are no more than 30,000 bags, while the production quantity exceeds 100,000 bags. Furthermore, foreign flour continues to be imported, reaching 300,000 large bags, posing a major threat to the flour industry.

### Foreign Merchant Registrations Less Than Half

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the Social Affairs Bureau began handling the registration of foreign-owned companies and businesses, as of the end of July, 18 foreign companies and over 340 businesses have registered. It is estimated that there are over 1,000 foreign companies and businesses in this city, and currently, less than half have registered.

### Foreign Ships Reluctant to Call at Shanghai Due to Slow Unloading and High Costs

[Reuters Hong Kong, 15th] Most of China's coastal shipping is still controlled by two British shipping companies, Jardine Matheson and Swire. Their ships regularly travel between various ports in South China and Shanghai and Hong Kong. However, many foreign ships that do not regularly sail these routes are considering not calling at Shanghai because of high loading and unloading costs and slow unloading. Instead, they would unload in Hong Kong and then transship to Shanghai.

Prosperity in Seafood

Dried shrimp tails are scarce and sales are brisk. The price increase is quite strong. Longkou vermicelli is favored by the Cantonese community, and the market situation is becoming tighter, creating a new high. Hunan lotus seeds are currently in short supply. The autumn season for fragrant mushrooms has arrived, and the production area market is upside down, so the situation is quite promising. Dried mussels and Job's tears are stable and firm. However, large sago, black moss, crab roe, and dried prawns have sluggish sales. For the rest of the goods, there is more prosperity than decline.

### As Shipping Dates Approach, Foreign Firms are Active in Tea

The tea market situation continues to be strong in domestic sales. In the foreign firms' tea market, both British and Indian firms are still active. Wuyuan's newly extracted premium tea was absorbed by Jardine Matheson & Co. at 28 chests, with the price reaching a high of 230,000 yuan per dan, a soaring increase of 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, Yu Long & Co. imported 164 chests of old Special Tribute tea. Wu Chang Tea Company purchased 37 chests of old Special Qimen tea, and also 72 chests of Chen Zhenmei tea. Da De Chang Tea Company collected 50 groups of Bai Lin aged black tea. Other varieties each had their own activity. Furthermore, it is understood that Jardine Matheson, Xie He, and other foreign firms sent personnel to Hangzhou last week to search for red and green tea. They have now returned to Shanghai. It is said that the inventory there is also as sparse as stars in the morning sky, and the sellers' asking prices are limitless, making it difficult to purchase for the time being. Therefore, the focus of attention has shifted back to this city.

### The Key to the Tung Oil Export Problem Lies in Transportation

[Our Newspaper's Report] Tung oil has always been a major export commodity of our country. During the War of Resistance, production shrank due to traffic congestion. The situation has not improved after victory. The United States has always been the main sales market for exports. However, because the price of tung oil produced in South America is currently cheaper than domestic goods, and at the same time, the United States has invented substitutes made from castor oil, domestic goods have been greatly affected. However, the quality of our country's tung oil is better, so it can still maintain a portion of the sales market. The main problem is still how to increase production and facilitate transportation. Currently, China Vegetable Oil Factory is engaged in the export trade of tung oil. From the victory until now, the factory has exported a total of about 10,000 tons of tung oil, with each ton consisting of 20 dan and each dan priced at 70,000 national currency, for a total value of about 140 million yuan.

### Autumn Harvest: Rice and Grain Abundant, Cotton and Tobacco Diminished

The cotton fields along the south bank of the Qiantang River in Zhejiang Province have had a diminished harvest this year. The cotton picking season has arrived, and cotton farmers are struggling to break even. The tobacco leaf harvest has been completed, with the yield being 30% lower than last year. However, the rice-producing areas along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway have had a very good harvest this year, 20-30% higher than last year. Therefore, recently, rice prices have plummeted from Jinhua and Lanxi all the way to Zhuji, with new rice being only 25,000 yuan per shi. It is heard that the new rice harvest in Jiangxi Province is even more abundant than in Zhejiang Province.

Nearly 20,000 packages of Xuzhou tobacco leaves have recently arrived in Shanghai, and tobacco leaf prices have already weakened.

### Foreign Estimates of Rice and Wheat Production

[Reuters Washington, 15th] It is estimated that China's wheat harvest can reach 22,400,000 tons, compared to 18,600,000 tons last year, and 22,600,000 tons before the war. The rice harvest is only 39,500,000 tons, compared to 45,000,000 tons before the war.

[Paris, 15th] It is estimated that the next season's rice harvest in French Indochina will reach 4,490,000 tons, and exports may reach 160,000 tons.

### Timber Market Situation

It is heard that Customs will auction off a large batch of enemy and puppet goods of Lauan plywood, and the market sentiment is weak, causing the market price to fall back. Due to the continued arrival of fir wood, the price is also not expected to rise.

### Floating Capital Averse to Risk, Short Selling Active: Chinese Stocks Remain Weak, Foreign Stocks See Sudden Surge in Buying

Chinese stocks lack encouragement from major players and are further ravaged by short selling, like a collapsing building. Floating capital is gradually becoming averse to risk. Various stocks continue to revolve and decline, with high prices in the morning and low prices in the afternoon. Midday high prices were 660 yuan for Yong Spinning, 3,690 yuan for Meiya, 213 yuan for Jingfu, 210 yuan for Xinguang, and 158 yuan for Qinxing. The near-noon low prices were 635 yuan for Yong Spinning, 3,450 yuan for Meiya, 195 yuan for Jingfu, 190 yuan for Xinguang, and 135 yuan for Qinxing. At noon, the market turned sluggish and business was quiet. The interest rate was reduced to 7.5 fen to 1 jiao 0.5 fen. Futures were lower than spot prices by 4 yuan, showing the bleak market conditions. Smaller and medium-sized stocks were also dragged down slightly. Veteran stocks were flat and weak, and the trend was not optimistic. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Yong Spinning and Meiya decreased slightly, and the three smaller hot stocks such as Jingfu also decreased by less than half a percent. The colder small and medium-sized stocks declined slightly, and the veteran stocks were flat.

Yesterday, foreign stocks suddenly saw a surge in buying. On the Chinese stock side, some floating capital was absorbed due to low prices. Major players such as Da Kang Cheng frequently absorbed shares. Foreign merchants had a healthy buying appetite. Yisha rose from 7,700 to 8,700, and then slightly retreated. British Union rose step by step from 7,900 to 8,750 yuan. Other stocks were also driven up. Foreign merchants were more eager to absorb Yecheng. The situation has improved. As a result, compared to the previous closing, the paper industry alone rose strongly by 10%, Yisha and British Union rebounded by 10%, and Yeguang, Hutchison, and Asia Steel each rose by half a percent. Although Yip Beer rose, it was not much.

### High-Quality Japonica Rice Still Scarce, Foreign Rice Distributed Yesterday

Yesterday, a total of over 5,000 shi of rice arrived in the North and South markets, mostly of medium and lower quality. The market situation remained high for high-quality and sluggish for lower-quality rice. White Yuan rice was scarce and sales were brisk, with an increase of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Due to the cloudy weather and limited supply, it also increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. 10,000 bags of Brazilian foreign rice, totaling 5,000 shi, were distributed to the North and South markets at a price of 54,000 yuan. Including expenses, the retail price at stores was 59,000 yuan. The supply and demand of flour were evenly matched, and the market situation was temporarily stable. Foreign flour continued to be sold. Shantou and Xiamen temporarily stopped absorbing wheat. The sales of white wheat were also sluggish. New soybeans from Gan, Anhui, Bian, and Wujin continued to arrive. High-quality goods still had a way to be sold, but medium and lower-quality goods had little trading and fell by 400-500 yuan. Aged soybeans decreased slightly by 500-600 yuan. Oil mills' absorption was also weak. Broad beans had gradually become scarce recently. The arrival of oil increased, and shops were looking forward to sales. All oils decreased uniformly by 1,000-2,000 yuan. The season for soybean cake consumption had passed, and it decreased again by 100-200 yuan. Bran sales in rural areas became more active, stopping the decline and rebounding by 100-200 yuan.

### No More Control Over New US Cotton

[Reuters Washington, 15th] In response to the question of whether the 1946 cotton harvest would also be subject to price restrictions under the New Price Control Act, officials from the Price Control Bureau recently replied that they believed that such a move would be illegal under the New Price Act. Therefore, they do not intend to impose price controls, and also said that President Truman has signed a bill prohibiting the trading, allocation, and acreage designation of the 1947 cotton, peanut, and other harvests.

### Actual Sales of Yarn and Cloth are Sluggish

Yesterday, the yarn market was sluggish, and actual sales remained sluggish. Fellow traders' spirits were low, and they were not concerned about gains and losses for the time being. Large-sized Shuangma yarn decreased by 20,000 to 30,000, and small to medium-sized yarns were also weak by about 10,000. However, various brands of 20-count yarns produced by the Textile Construction Corporation remained stable because small weaving factories had some selection and trade.

The trend of grey cloth turned flat. Due to the decline in the yarn market, actual sales were not smooth, so morale weakened again. The Textile Construction Corporation continued to sell Pique fabric and had a large supply. The market declined, falling by 750 yuan. However, the grey cloth from private factories was eagerly sought by the South, and the market situation remained at its original level. The Textile Construction Corporation continued to sell as usual, and the market declined slightly.

### Sugar Prices are on the Rise, the Ninth Period has been Distributed

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to a spokesperson from the Second Section of the Economic Administration Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, the ninth period of edible sugar has now been completely distributed. To alleviate the sugar shortage in other locations, the Social Affairs Bureau has decided that the next period of sugar will be exclusively allocated to other locations, and the eleventh period will resume allocation to sugar merchants in this city.

Yesterday, the market for medium and fine sugar lacked distribution from the company and relied solely on goods from the Fujian and Wenzhou gangs. The supply was indeed limited, so market prices continued to rise. The opening price increased by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Other sugars such as Xinghua white sugar also followed suit. The upper grade opened at 142,000 yuan, and the lower grade at 138,000 to 136,000 yuan, with over 100 transactions. The Shantou gang opened with refined green sugar at 95,000 yuan and washed green sugar at 94,000 to 93,500 yuan, with over 400 packages transacted. The price of raw brown sugar allocated by the company to the trading companies was set at 70,000 yuan, with a quantity of approximately 30,000 packages.

### After Sugar Prices are Suppressed and Stabilized, Candy and Preserves are Reduced in Price

Since the Confectionery, Candy, Canned Goods, and Bread Industry Association of this city obtained sugar allocation, it has reduced the selling prices of its products accordingly. For example, candy was reduced by 1.34%, preserves by 25%, and pastries by 20%. The quality remains the same. Biscuit prices remain unchanged because the coal used still needs to be purchased on the black market.

### Internal Strife Continues, Affecting Foreign Bonds

[British News Agency, London, 14th] According to the Financial Times, after Special Envoy Marshall stated that a peaceful resolution to China's internal problems was currently impossible, Chinese bonds in London fell across the board and were virtually ignored. The market was bleak, and prices fell by three pounds. The 4.5% interest bonds of 1898 fell to 66 pounds, the 5% interest bonds of 1912 and 1913 each fell to 46 pounds and 50 pounds respectively. The 5% Boxer Indemnity bonds fell to 68 pounds. The 5% South Manchuria Railway bonds fell to 28 pounds.

### Taiwan Agricultural Experiment Station: Our Newspaper's Taipei Airmail Report of the 8th: Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun

The Taiwan Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station, with agricultural experimentation as its center, is one of the most extensive research institutions in the province. It boasts ten experimental branch stations spread throughout the province, encompassing horticulture, tea, animal husbandry, tropical agriculture, and other departments. The depth of agricultural experimentation during the Japanese colonial period of Taiwan, spanning fifty years, is strikingly evident. At the time of the takeover, the station had a total of 332 personnel, all of whom were Japanese except for eight Taiwanese. Currently, they retain 67 Japanese technicians. Although more than 40 people have been newly added from other provinces, the lack of high-level research talent will be felt keenly when these Japanese return to their country this year, necessitating recruitment from various domestic sources.

### Eight New Varieties are Superior to Taiwan Rice Varieties

Most of Taiwan is subtropical, allowing for year-round crop cultivation. Rice can be grown twice a year in the north. The Japanese gradually expanded existing block farms into concentrated farms. To maximize land use, they studied and adopted a system of crop rotation, potentially involving three crops: rice, sugarcane, and potatoes/flax. These crop varieties were developed and supplied by the station. Due to the large-scale demand for food during the war, the Chiayi Experimental Branch Station collected 399 species of sweet potatoes from around the world and cultivated 30 improved varieties, promoting them throughout the province. Previously, local varieties averaged only 27% dried sweet potato yield, but now the improved varieties yield 36%. In terms of starch content, the improved varieties have 26%, compared to the local varieties' 17%, which is highly beneficial for the fermentation industry. The Japanese favored Penglai rice. Over decades, they cultivated eight new varieties. Their quality and yield are superior to local varieties. Three varieties are still being tested in various regions.

### Two Special Medicines are Particularly Difficult to Propagate

The agronomy department has over 1,000 mu of farmland for experimentation. The reporter, guided by Mr. Ji Jingyuan, surveyed the experimental fields where the second rice crop had been completed. He said: The department is the main backbone of the general station. Currently, there are fewer experiments being conducted. Most efforts are focused on variety preservation. Among fiber crops, 75 species of jute and 60 species of ramie are being preserved. Among oil crops, 65 species of peanuts, 21 species of sesame, and over ten species of sunflowers are being preserved. The medicinal plants *Yusaki Kudzu* (see picture), a special medicine for lung disease, and *Hongtou Teng*, both wild on sandy soils at mountain peaks, have round underground stems that can be extracted to treat tuberculosis. When transplanted to flat land, they require strong sunlight, high temperatures, dryness, and ample rainfall. Furthermore, the vines need to be supported with frames. Because they do not easily produce seeds, and the seeds are difficult to germinate after being produced, propagation is limited. There are also varieties of *Kumis Kuelin*, which can be extracted to treat kidney disease, and three insecticidal agents that have been widely studied domestically: *Tephrosia vogelii* and *Guangdong Shulang*.

We especially visited the agricultural machinery exhibition room. There were no specially made agricultural machines, only a common rice thresher. Its needles are made of iron wire, which is slightly better than the ones made of iron nails used domestically. According to Mr. Ji, they are currently only doing variety preservation work, but recently even this has become a problem because of a lack of fertilizer! The Japanese researched a forecast device for abundant and lean years, based on a comprehensive estimate of weather, rainfall, etc., and created an instrument. It has been 12 years, and they still haven't gotten results!

### Five Major Pests: Investigation, Research, and Implementation of Eradication

Over a hundred species of pests pose a great threat to rice. The five major pests are stem borers, leafhoppers, rice beetles, leaf miners, and stink bugs. At their worst, these pests can completely destroy the rice crop. Stem borers usually damage about 3% to 5% of the crop annually. Leafhoppers occur in September and October during years with little rainfall. Rice beetles and leaf miners occur during the early stages of the second and first crops, reducing the harvest by about 20% to 30%. Black stink bugs and spider stink bugs both damage the rice stems, absorbing nutrients and causing a reduction in yield of over 10%.

There are 44 species of pests that infest sweet potatoes. The most damaging is the sweet potato weevil, which damages the sweet potato roots, causing rot and even total crop failure. Among the pests of fruit trees and vegetables, those related to exported agricultural products are the Citrus and Mango Fruit Fly, which infests citrus and mango fruits and is widely distributed in Fujian, Guangdong, and other provinces, and the Melon Fly, which infests melons. The U.S. plant inspection authorities also pay close attention to this.

Over the past ten years, these pests have been investigated using moth traps to determine the number of stem borer moths killed and the status of occurrence. Statistical research has been conducted, and data on stem borer moth occurrence is currently being organized to make predictions. Currently, research is being conducted on the control of stem borers affecting rice and the control of sweet potato weevils damaging sweet potatoes using chemical methods. Trials are also underway on the impact of chemical spraying on tea trees, as well as investigations into vegetable pests, scale insects, and beneficial insects (natural enemies).

In the agricultural chemistry laboratory, a technician from mainland China is analyzing the effective components in sweet potato black spot disease and solidified starch. He said that he is preparing to complete the chemical analysis of iron-based purification.

### Hainan Island Pig Breed: Thin Skin, Delicious Taste, High Reproductive Capacity

The animal husbandry of this province is declining. The main livestock is pigs, with production second only to rice and sugar. The highest number of pigs raised in the province was 1.8 million, with an average of 4.5 pigs per farm household. The annual slaughter number was approximately 1.2 million. However, there are currently only 300,000 to 500,000 heads. This sharp decline is due to a lack of feed, lax control, and a lack of government incentives!

According to Mr. Li Dongliang of the animal husbandry department, most of the world's best breeds contain Asian blood, but this characteristic is often overlooked. They are currently conducting surveys and research on pig breeds in the southern region, hoping to obtain Asian pig breeds and select them for improvement. The focus of the work is the Hainan Island pig.

(1) To improve Taiwan pig breeds, the Taoyuan pig of this province and the Berkshire pig of England were used in progressive breeding up to the third generation. Then, inbreeding was performed to fix its performance, and selection and elimination were carried out to breed a pure black pig breed similar to the Taoyuan pig in color and the Berkshire pig in body shape (see picture). Its advantages have not yet been determined, so it cannot be promoted.

(2) Research on the Hainan Island pig breed. Its body shape is unique: small ears, concave back, drooping belly, thin bones, and short legs. The hair on the neck and back is black, while the abdomen and limbs are white. The forehead often has a white triangular star. It belongs to the Asian family, the Chinese small-eared flower pig breed. The meat is delicious, the skin is thin, and the reproductive capacity is strong. It is a medium-sized fatty pig breed. They are currently continuing research and may become one of the best breeds in South China in the future (see picture).

Mr. Shitian, a Japanese who has worked with pigs for 14 years, led the reporter up the hillside to visit the pigsty he designed and the processed animal products: ham, cured meat, sausage, and liver powder and casings made from livestock organs. When he presented a string of white and thin casings as light as gauze, he said: "China imports a large quantity of casings from the United States every year. The production method should be improved as soon as possible!"

In 1941, the Japanese allocated 13 taels of meat per person, which was later changed to one tael. After the recovery, the allocation was cancelled. We are now eating the most expensive meat in the country, at 96 Taiwan dollars per catty. Shitian said: "This is probably the result of a lack of management!"

Hoping the Suzhou Power Plant Will Devise Methods to Fully Supply Electricity

To the Editor: Ancient Suzhou lags behind in all endeavors. Since the victory, the railway authority is perhaps the only entity that has been relatively satisfactory. During the enemy and puppet regime, taking the train was a headache. Now, that's all gone, and travel is convenient. However, the power plant authority, since taking over from the enemy and puppet regime, has stopped supplying electricity during the day. This has forced existing factories to shut down, leading to increased unemployment. Despite repeated appeals and petitions from relevant industrial and commercial sectors, the plant has shown no signs of improvement. Compared to Shanghai and Wuxi, where electricity flows day and night, it's hard not to feel envious! Recently, it was reported that the Shanghai Fuel Commission has significantly increased coal allocation to Suzhou. Yet, the power plant authority continues to collect coal surcharges from factories monthly, pricing it at black market rates, causing the cost of electricity to far exceed that of lighting. Factories have already paid a hefty price but cannot fully utilize it. Before the incident, Suzhou had 500 factories of varying sizes, all reliant on electricity for power. Even amidst eight years of turmoil, there has been some progress, with the total number of factories approaching 800. Since the victory last year, less than 200 have resumed operations. Furthermore, they can only start production after 2 PM when the plant opens the electricity supply. From 8 PM to 10 PM, the power plant authority automatically cuts power to divert it for lighting. If this continues, Suzhou's existing factories will inevitably revert to closure. The Suzhou power plant authority bears the heavy responsibility of being the primary driver of the city's production. It is hoped that they will devise methods for improvement soon. I eagerly await this! (Survival)

Hotels' Alarming Price Hike

To the Editor: This 60% price increase in the hotel industry is, in effect, a vanguard for rising prices. Now that prices of various goods have begun to fall, why is the hotel industry alone increasing its prices? It is truly puzzling. I am a civil servant who came to Shanghai in early April. Unable to rent a house, I moved into a hotel on Xinzha Road. At that time, the rent was 3,060 yuan per day, accounting for only one-third of my income. Now, in less than four months, it has increased to 9,420 yuan per day, which my entire monthly income cannot even cover for rent. I recall that before the war, the room I stayed in cost only 8 jiao per day. The current price is more than 10,000 times higher! Isn't that alarming? Even rice, at its most expensive, is only about 6,000 times more expensive than before the war. The authorities should pay close attention to this. Do not ignore the hotel industry's price increases, allowing them to rise unchecked. The majority of guests staying in hotels now are civil servants, and some have even fled from the liberated areas, all suffering immensely. Furthermore, price increases in one industry are connected to other industries. Do not overlook this, as it is no small contribution to the well-being of society! (Chen Yixing)

### The Chess Game in Northern Jiangsu

— Our Yangzhou Dispatch on the 10th, Special Correspondent Hang Zhou

The current situation in Northern Jiangsu is like a game of chess, with the National Army on one side and the Communist Army on the other.

Negotiations are continuing, albeit tenuously, in Lushan and Nanjing, with the Northern Jiangsu issue being a major point of discussion. The government, citing Northern Jiangsu's proximity to the capital region, demands that the Communist Army withdraw north of the Longhai Railway. Will the Communist Party relinquish Northern Jiangsu? This is a question people are anxiously pondering. While negotiations have yet to yield results, an observer quietly watching the game in Northern Jiangsu already understands the possible developments.

Let's first look at the Communist Party.

The Communist Party's military occupation, political, and economic "revolution" in Northern Jiangsu are well-known. However, we must reiterate that the Chinese Communist Party is not a political party "seeking the welfare of the people," as it claims. Instead, it is an absolute violent group determined to "seize the country." When the Northeast was in turmoil, it sought to seize the Northeast. When Beijing and Shanghai were vulnerable, it even attempted to infiltrate them. Therefore, asking it to relinquish Northern Jiangsu is akin to cutting off its flesh.

The Communist Party promotes an advanced Marxist communist theory, but its actions are no different from those of ancient bandits. The 1950s are an era of scientific masses, where people adhere to truth, not submit to violence. Looking at the members of the Communist Party, one feels they are truly the scourge of China!

The peasant uprisings of ancient China are greatly admired by the Communist Party. Thus, it gathers those who dream of such "heroic dreams," wanting to conquer the world from horseback regardless of consequences. Consequently, its first priority is to cultivate military force. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, it recruited soldiers and bought horses for eight full years. Upon victory, it struck it rich even more. Documents captured by the National Army from the Communist Party serve as proof:

"Japan has unconditionally surrendered. The handling of puppet army and puppet organization personnel will be carried out in accordance with the following orders from the Military Affairs Department: All puppet army and puppet organization personnel who voluntarily surrender to us will be granted the following three guarantees: (1) Guarantee the safety of life and property of all surrendering officers and soldiers; (2) Guarantee that units will not be disbanded or disarmed; (3) Guarantee existing official positions and not deprive military power."

This document was jointly issued by the Headquarters of the First Military Sub-district of the Communist Party's Central China Military Region, its Political Department, and the Commissioner's Office of the First Administrative Region.

Think about it: the Communist Party is composed of such elements. What benefits can it bring to the people? What democracy can it fight for? Northern Jiangsu—this lamb struggling under the Communist Party's knife has already voiced its human anger!

The government authorities cannot turn a blind eye to this fact. The government's demand that the Communist Army withdraw from Northern Jiangsu is not only for the security of the capital but also to rescue the people of Northern Jiangsu from their suffering.

However, the government cannot use force as casually as the Communist Party. Therefore, it painstakingly seeks to resolve the Communist Party issue through political means—the Northern Jiangsu issue being one of them.

But what if political means cannot solve the problem? Will the situation be allowed to drag on indefinitely? Will a public denunciation be issued?

I believe neither will happen because the National Army is silently playing this chess game.

The pieces have been arranged. With the movement of a few pieces, the situation will be initially settled. Observers will immediately understand that although the National Army is in a passive position, its strategy is superior, leaving the opponent powerless and threatening to destabilize the entire board.

Recently, the situation has calmed down. Only the advance and retreat of individual soldiers are seen on the chessboard, seemingly insignificant but precisely strategic maneuvers.

The National Army's chariots, horses, and cannons are all positioned in appropriate locations, posing a terrifying power to the opponent. Not only are the attacking pieces in danger of being annihilated, but the entire army also risks being wiped out. An inferior player, though not highly skilled, should know that timely withdrawal is the best strategy. A superior chess player does not need to pursue the attack to win the game!

Northern Jiangsu Trip - Three

### Tragedy in "Paradise"

— Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 10th, Reporter Huang Xing Tian

On the 5th of this month, a sensational tragedy occurred in the quiet city of Hangzhou, giving idlers in teahouses and wine shops more material for gossip. It turns out that Wang Jinyu, a young woman from Poyang, Jiangxi, and the wealthy daughter of a tycoon, only 23 years old, unwilling to endure the abuse of her stepmother, eloped with her lover, Huang Baohe, a fellow student. They brought fourteen trunks of valuables, hoping to establish a happy and fulfilling small family in this "paradise."

However, upon arriving in Jianggan, Huang Baohe suddenly took twelve trunks of valuables worth over 14 million, claiming he was going ahead to find a house. The infatuated Wang Jinyu waited for him for six hours but never saw him return. She had no choice but to have the boatman take her to the West Lake Hotel. Wang, having lost her lover and her wealth, was filled with extreme resentment. After staying for two days, she met Chen Shaoyun, a singer, Wang's wife, and Ren Tianfu, a West Lake boatman, and A Kang, inviting her to stay in their house. They discovered that Wang still had a large sum of money hidden in the two small leather trunks she possessed. On the evening of the 4th, they invited Wang Jinyu to sail on West Lake, introducing a friend who claimed he could help find her fellow townsmen. The next morning, they brought their friend, Li Yongchang, claiming to have found them. They then took Wang's small leather trunks and left together. Unexpectedly, upon reaching the intersection of Yingshi Street and Yue Wang Road, they separately escaped by car. Wang Jinyu cried for help, losing five gold rings, 800,000 yuan in legal tender, and other belongings. Eventually, she felt hopeless and wanted to throw herself into the river at Pinghai Bridge. She was excessively saddened and cried all the way, so her attempted suicide was prevented, and she was taken to the police station. When asked why she wanted to commit suicide, Wang Jinyu frankly said: "Hangzhou has so many villains. What's the point of me living in such a world, with such a fate?"

The world is like this, and fate depends on the path you take. Wang Jinyu's tragedy has become a joke on people's lips. One moment, it's rumored that the boatman Ren Tianfu tried to rape her. Another moment, it's said that a man "abandoned by his concubine" is willing to keep her company, so that everyone gets what they want...…. The teahouses and hotels are in an uproar, and the newspaper supplements are also discussing it vigorously. Some pity Wang Jinyu, others scold her for being romantic, and still others curse this feudal system and this dark society. However, whether pitied or scolded, society is as it is, and Wang Jinyu has ultimately become a victim. Although the police accidentally caught Li Yongchang while cracking down on gambling, accidental is ultimately accidental. This is truly a serious social problem in a transitional period.

Following the Wang Jinyu incident, there was another small wave in Hangzhou society: Zhou Zuoping, a clerk in the Civil Affairs Section of the Municipal Government, went missing. Two days later, Zhou Zuoping's wife received a letter, which was a suicide note sent by Zhou Zuoping through a friend. The main idea was that he was a poor civil servant, struggling financially, and unwilling to live any longer. Since the newspaper found his "whereabouts"—death—regardless of whether Zhou Zuoping jumped into the turbid tides of the Qiantang River or hanged himself in the desolate mountains, apart from civil servants feeling "sorrow for each other," society had long forgotten him completely. Wang Jinyu is a semi-new and semi-old woman cultivated in the feudal environment of the inland. She jumped out of the family prison with full dreams, but she didn't know the complexity of the world, the cruelty of society. A simple and enthusiastic girl was finally ruined in the clutches of a sinful society. And Zhou Zuoping, who killed him? Although he did not have heroic aspirations, did he not have a pair of hands willing to work hard? But he went missing and committed suicide! In today's world where our country and society are facing such a serious crisis, the reporter can't help but express sympathy for the characters in the tragedy and accuse the "heroes" who disrupt social order and disturb people's lives!

### Political Hurricane in Guangxi

— Our Guilin Air Dispatch on the 4th, Special Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong

In mid-July, a hurricane raging in the Pacific Ocean, carrying a weary body, spiraled into the high skies of the scorching southwest, slowly turning into a melancholic cyclone. A cold rain fell, and the hurricane silently dissipated. However, the political hurricane, hidden beneath the surface, unable to be concealed or resisted any longer, spread with an overwhelming force. A storm agitated the minds of those in power, frightened the corrupt officials, slapped the hands of the common people, and kept the reporter's pen busy. Accusations flew! An astonishingly large opium case!

### First Shot: Telling the People to Plant "Wheat"

As early as two years ago, in winter, just as the enemy cavalry was invading westward and the flames of war were nearing the Yangtze, Guangxi's fate was also teetering on the brink of crisis. Baise, a small mountain town far away on the western frontier, unexpectedly became Guangxi's military and political center, and the remote and desolate counties west of Baise became the targets of those with a deep thirst for officialdom. It was in that complex environment that an opium case worth 140 million yuan, containing a huge political conspiracy, was unveiled.

First, two notorious scoundrels in official circles, one named Huang Qi and the other named Luo Chengjun, after much maneuvering, were appointed as county magistrates of Xilong and Xilin respectively. These two places are far on the borders of Guizhou and Guangxi, with steep mountains and forests, practically outside the sphere of civilization. Only in such uncivilized places could an unparalleled opium case arise. Before taking office, these two magistrates are said to have received many secret instructions, the main one being "Plant as much opium as possible," "Exchange opium for money," and "Use money to buy guns." The use of money and guns was an unspeakable secret in those turbulent days. And so it was, after this and that, the two villains took office. Their first move was to issue verbal and written orders to village cadres: "To implement administrative orders, money is essential; but where does the money come from? Naturally, only from planting large amounts of 'wheat' (a clever euphemism for 'opium')!" Once the verbal order was given, it was carried out swiftly and thoroughly. The next step was to open gambling dens. The magistrate ordered the planting of opium and the opening of gambling dens. Truly, his kindness and virtue were profound! Plant, then! Gamble, then! As a result, wheat fields turned green everywhere, and the sounds of fan-tan gambling echoed. Administrative personnel were overjoyed, wealth flowed like water, and Customs Gold piled up like mountains. From the magistrate to the janitors, all were "stuffed to death." The Customs Gold stored in the magistrate's house was uncountable and could only be measured with a ruler. When workers poured water for the magistrate's face every day, they stole more than 4 million yuan, grabbing handfuls from the piles of banknotes. Truly, there was nothing like it before or since.

### Two Scoundrels Dust Off Their Butts and Flee

From the growth of opium seedlings to their transformation into "hawthorn cakes" (opium paste), the common people's flesh and blood were squeezed dry. At that time, the "orders" to "remit funds" arrived urgently and in succession. Thus, two hundred long-gun carrying police officers escorted several dozen loads of banknotes, crossing mountains and ridges, requisitioning food from peasants along the way, as if facing a formidable enemy, all the way to Baise. Only then was the task completed, and the credit recorded in the ledger. At this time, the virtuous Chairman Huang was recuperating in Chengdu and had not yet returned. Provincial affairs were being handled by Chen Liangzuo, the Commissioner of Civil Affairs. Following the outflow of banknotes, the people of Xilong and Xilin Counties sent countless telegrams and letters of denunciation, creating a city-wide sensation in Baise, known to all. The total extortion of 140 million yuan, written as numerals, is 1,400,000,000 yuan, a string of zeros, how could this be! It is said that Commissioner Chen was quite opposed to evil and immediately dispatched personnel for "thorough investigation." At the same time, someone made an urgent phone call to the two counties to "secretly investigate." Strangely, the phone call turned into a telegram. Some people could only hear a series of numbers like "2714.4099.6643.6382" on the phone. As soon as the phone call was made, the personnel dispatched for thorough investigation were still climbing the mountains, but Huang Qi and Luo Chengjun could no longer wait, dusted off their butts, and fled.

It should also be reported that the two gentlemen "escaped" extremely comfortably. They stayed in Chongqing for a while, and after Guilin was liberated, they ran back to Guilin, staying there for a short time. Hearing that they were wanted, they are now taking a boat to Hong Kong to escape the heat. Coincidentally, they were on the same boat as the wife of a commissioner heading east. When the case broke, the provincial government was in Baise, the Liangguang Inspectorate was in Baise, the Commander's Headquarters was in Baise, and countless other political figures were gathered there. However, the weather in Baise was too bad. All I can tell readers is about the weather. As for who received how many millions of banknotes, who received the most gifts at what time, those are all old rumors.

### Journey to Mount Tianmu

— Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 6th, Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

"Mount Tianmu hangs down two breasts, dragons fly and phoenixes dance to Qiantang," these are Guo Jingchun's verses about Mount Tianmu. The two breasts of Tianmu likely refer to two streams, one being the water of East Tianmu, which flows through Lin'an; forming the three streams of Zhongtiao, Nantiao, and Beichao. When mountain torrents come, they surge and dance, rushing down thousands of miles, capable of inundating the Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Wuxing areas. It is said that Chen Hun once dug a large pond thirty miles in circumference in Yuhang to store water, avoiding damage to the fertile fields of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Wuxing. Now, in addition to South Lake in Yuhang, there is also a North Lake. It is said that the water of East Tianmu flows directly to Tai Lake. The water of West Tianmu forms Tianmu Creek, flowing into the Qiantang River.

Having admired the name of Mount Tianmu, and urgently needing to know the recent situation of the counties near Tianmu, the reporter embarked on a journey to Mount Tianmu. The plan was to pass through the four western Zhejiang counties of Yuhang, Lin'an, Yuqian, and Yuhua.

### Visiting Yuhang and Lin'an at the Foot of the Mountain

Traveling from Hangzhou to Yuhang, it was expected that the road would be quite bad, as the drivers of ten-wheeled trucks were particularly cautious. Fortunately, nothing went wrong, and we arrived safely. I inquired with many local people, the county government, and local figures, and learned that the Zhongtiao, Nantiao, and Beichao Streams were all silted up. South Lake was also gradually unable to hold the amount of water flowing down from the Chao Streams due to the accumulation of too much mud and sand. Locals emphasized that if South Lake was not repaired, when South Lake overflowed, it would flood the western Zhejiang Plain, which would be terrible.

Over the past eight or nine years, Yuhang has suffered the ravages of the enemy and puppet regime. Therefore, it is extremely dilapidated. Famous throughout the country for its silk production, Yuhang now feels hopeless because 80% of the mulberry forests have been sacrificed. Due to the loss of mulberry forests, it is impossible to raise silkworms, let alone produce silk. The abandoned mulberry forest area has not been planted with anything else. Moreover, a considerable portion of the county's 190,000 mu of fertile land and 500,000 mu of mountainous land is also barren. This may be due to labor difficulties, but according to surveys, the original population of 130,000 has now reached over 110,000, a difference of just over 20,000.

Silk production cannot be revived, so the famous Yuhang silk cotton has also declined sharply. In its heyday, there were 300,000 sheets of silkworm eggs and 45,000 jin of silk cotton, but now there are fewer than 100,000 sheets of silkworm eggs and less than 10,000 jin of silk cotton.

Another economic enterprise of Yuhang is the export of calligraphy brush handles. Yuhang has many small bamboo branches that can be used as brush handles. Only Yuhang bamboo can be used to make brush handles. Before the war, they sold well throughout the country, especially in North China, Northeast China, and North Jiangsu. Now, due to the presence of the Communist Party, they cannot be transported north.

They also produce some yellow and white paper. Yellow paper is used for sacrificial burning, mainly sold in North Jiangsu. White paper can be written on and is also sold in North Jiangsu. Now, both are stagnant, with no sales at all. Due to the lack of production opportunities, Yuhang has turned to commerce, or the export of goods from the western Zhejiang mountains. Other daily necessities are imported, such as bamboo shoots, chestnuts, white fruit, and mountain walnuts from Changhua, but due to the sluggish market and stagnant sales, they are gradually declining. When the reporter arrived in Yuhang, dozens of mountain goods stores had already closed, revealing immense difficulties.

Traveling from Yuhang to Lin'an, the road gradually worsened. The car struggled through mud ditches and deep pits, barely making it to Lin'an, but both the people and the car were exhausted. Lin'an suffered terrible bombing by enemy planes during the War of Resistance. Almost nothing was left standing in the city. Now, some thatched sheds and low houses have been built, but they are scattered, showing desolation and sadness.

### More Mountains Than Land, More Land Than Fields

In Lin'an, there are more mountains than land, and more land than fields. The population is only 60,099. Terraced fields outnumber flat fields. It is said that 68% of the land is terraced. Because of this, when mountain water comes, the erosive effect is particularly strong. Although we are accustomed to seeing barren stony mountains in Guizhou in the rear, if protection measures are not taken here, the same phenomenon will occur. If they become barren mountains, when the Tianmu River floods, it will inundate the area for miles, and the harvest of fields will be greatly affected.

Bamboo and wood are the main products here, especially dried bamboo shoots, which are famous throughout the country. There are three types of dried bamboo shoots: one is "baked shoot heads," the most tender shoot tips; one is "fat, bald shoots," the older shoot tips; and one is "early rounds," early bamboo shoots that are harvested and made into round shapes. To make dried bamboo shoots, they dig out the tender shoots, boil them in a pot with salt, and then dry them. After they are made, they are packed in bamboo strips and sold in the market. These dried bamboo shoots have an extremely delicious flavor and can last for a long time. If they can be improved further, they can be sold abroad on a large scale, because foreign beef jerky is not even a fraction as good as the taste of dried bamboo shoots.

The uses of wood include charcoal, incense powder, and firewood. Recently, except for large timber, firewood and charcoal have sold better. Incense powder is used for burning incense and lighting candles. Because sales in northern Jiangsu are not smooth, it is not managed on a large scale. I think it would be better to use incense powder to make mosquito coils.

Bamboo can be used to make woodenware, and raw bamboo is also sold outside. It is bundled into posts of dozens or tens of stems, selling about 30,000 to 40,000 posts, but recently, due to the impact of the current situation, sales are not so good.

Other products include silk and tea, but in general, they are entering a state of recession.

When I was in Yuhang, I heard that Yuhang was plagued by rice stem borers, but when I came to Lin'an and met local people, I learned that the rice stem borers were even more severe than in Yuhang. Government personnel, because they have no medicines, no equipment, no tools, and no appropriate methods, let the pitiful and lovely farmers pray to gods and worship Buddhas, and welcome divine guests. After Chairman Shen's inspection tour, he ordered the provincial government to find ways to remedy the situation. As far as this reporter knows, the best way to control rice stem borers is of course medicine. If there is no medicine, wooden or bamboo pieces can be made into large combs to comb them off. We hope that Yuhang and Lin'an counties, which already lack grain production, will no longer neglect the harm of rice stem borers.

In the suburbs of Lin'an, you can see Tianmu Mountain, towering high into the clouds, like a huge celestial phenomenon. A few clouds have entered its mountainside and can no longer smooth its back.

Looking back, we see the pagoda on the mountain in Lin'an. Local people told me that this pagoda is to commemorate King Qian Wusu, called the Gongchen Pagoda, to express respect for Qian Liu. Qian Liu was indeed from Lin'an, and his tomb is still buried there. There is a shrine in front of his tomb, and the relics of stone men and horses suggest the grandeur and prosperity of the past, but recently it seems that few people have cleaned it up, so it also shows a dilapidated appearance.

Local people told me that this is considered to be at the foot of Tianmu Mountain.

### Visiting Yuqian and Changhua on the Mountain Range

From Lin'an, one can go to Eastern Tianmu Mountain, and the county government is preparing to develop Eastern Tianmu, so they are building a highway. According to locals, the fun places are still in Western Tianmu. According to historical records, Eastern Tianmu has scenic spots such as Daxian Peak, Erxian Peak, Huancui Peak, Baozhu Peak, General Peak, Elephant Nose Peak, Lion Peak, Wansong Cliff, Wangjiang Terrace, Guanyue Terrace, Tiaoyu Terrace, Rhinoceros Ridge, Longxu Ridge, Duobao Slope, Pinhu Stone, Waterfall Spring, Yujian Spring, Xixin Spring, Xianyan Spring, Liandan Pond, Fuyu Pond, Bailong Pond, Yinxiandong Cave, Ziyang Cave, Zhaoming Temple, Pingxi Nunnery, Qifeng Pavilion, and Guanpu Pavilion. However, it is feared that travel will be inconvenient due to the lack of a highway, so Western Tianmu is more famous than Eastern Tianmu.

We want to bypass Tianmu Mountain and first investigate two counties on the Tianmu Mountain range, and then go to Tianmu Mountain. So we still take a large truck forward. This section of the road is even more difficult to travel. Not only struggling through mud ditches, but also struggling on dirt without a road surface. When crossing streams, we have to wade through the water, and the car is shaking and groaning. I asked Mr. Tan Jiquan who was traveling with me: "Since the Ministry of Transportation has not paid attention to it for a long time, why don't the people come to repair it?" He told me: "If we make a big fuss, not only will it not be good, but the local people will also complain about being meddlesome." The fact is also the same, there must be a plan, but today this road is no longer a road. But it was once called the Hanghui Highway. I am really indignant when will it be repaired!

Arriving in Yuqian, we rested for a while and continued to move forward, wading through rapid shoals, and water splashed into the car. Really, our car has become an amphibious tank, which is really something unheard of.

### Seventy Thousand People, Thirty Thousand Pieces of Land

Arriving in Changhua County, the county town was not destroyed, but it is extremely small. It is in western Zhejiang, adjacent to Anhui. There are often some bad people who come to harass here. Not long ago, some rogue hooligans, under the banner of the "×× Army," came to disrupt the peace. Later, the troops were sent away, and they fled to Anhui. This is an even more mountainous countryside, with more than 70,000 people, but only more than 30,000 pieces of land, each person can only be divided into more than five points of land. And more than 70,000 people need more than 300,000 dan of rice to live. In bumper years, the annual output is about 200,000 dan, which is still not enough. This year, late rice is suffering from rice stem borers, which can be said to be the most serious here. We look out over the fields, a yellow expanse of withered crops. This is indeed an important issue at present.

There are only two guaranteed households in Changhua City. Women usually weave cloth and also look after silkworm and tea trees, but this is not a major industry. The largest product is wood. Last year, wood sales were very good, with 3,000 to 4,000 taels sold. The so-called "taels" are the way of measuring wood. A ruler with degrees is used to measure the size of the wood, and taels and cents are used for calculation. At that time, the highest price per tael was more than 200,000 yuan, which is imaginable as a huge figure. But now it is not possible, sales are not good, and huge funds cannot be harvested, which means that Changhua has lost a fee for nourishing the local area.

On the way to Tianmu Mountain

The image shows a vehicle still having to wade through water after repairs.

Changhua is surrounded by mountains, and the mountains and forests are lush. There are many high mountains in the distance, which look like virgin forests. Some people say that it is not enough for Changhua to rely solely on the Hanghui Highway for transportation. It is best to use the Tianmu River to open up dangerous shoals and connect it to the Tonglu River to enter the Qiantang River. Then, the locally produced wood can be transported out by waterway. But he does not think that the reason is not because no one knows about Changhua's wood, but because of the unrest in the country, everyone is afraid to start construction.

Mountain walnuts are very famous, but they fail to bear fruit two out of every three years. This is the temperament of mountain walnuts. This year happens to be a year of failure, so how will they overcome this difficulty?

Because Changhua has many mountains, the mineral deposits are extremely rich. There are anthracite mines in Gushan, Zhamen Township, and there is also coal in Puchun Village, Shirui Township, and Qiankeng, Riliguan Township. The one in Zhamen Township has been open for two months. There are antimony mines in Siwu, Dongshanping, Jiakou Township, Zhongzhen Township, Wulong Town, and Qingshantan in the county. The one in Jiakou Township has also been open for two months. There are manganese mines in Xiejiacun, Zhamen Township, iron mines in Baizhangwu, Jiakou Township, and gold mines in Zhangjiawu, Renxi Township. Moreover, it is said that some people on the Anhui border have come to pan for gold sporadically.

Changhua County has so many mineral deposits, of course, it still needs experts to survey and explore them. But since Changhua has so many mountains, or maybe there are mines, we certainly hope that in the Zhejiang land where industry is hopeless, an unexpected industrial treasure will suddenly be discovered underground. Then the need for firewood and charcoal will be less, the trees can also be preserved, and there is no need to worry about the coal mines in Changxing, and our trains will not be afraid of running out of fuel.

With excited emotions, we returned to Yuqian along the uneven road from Changhua. Yuqian also experienced the enemy's fierce bombing. On the day after the Japanese enemy surrendered, the Japanese soldiers still came here lawlessly, robbing things and killing innocent people.

There is only one street here, which has now become a road. The houses are not very tidy. The population is 59,966 people, and the area is 212,304 square kilometers. The products include Atractylodes macrocephala, which is said to be able to cure all diseases. There are two types: wild and planted. The wild ones are not easy to find, and there are more planted ones. Most of the ones sold in the market are planted. The so-called wild ones are those produced in the mountains, said to be planted by immortals. In the past, the late Chairman Lin Sen of the National Government often needed this item.

Other products include silk, wood, dried bamboo shoots, Taohua paper, and tung oil, but these are not major products. This year, Yuqian is also experiencing an insect disaster, with rice stem borers spreading throughout the fields, making them difficult to deal with.

Having visited Changhua and Yuqian counties, I also feel that the economic foundation is not very stable. It is truly a time of dangerous situations.

In the suburbs of Yuqian, we looked at the peak of Tianmu Mountain again, seeing how majestic and steep it is. I think the economic foundation of these four counties in western Zhejiang will not just decline. It is said that Shen Honglie is already raising funds for them, and I cannot help but wish the future of western Zhejiang well!

### Answering Readers - Medicine and Hygiene

(1) Wang Younian asked: When I was young, I fell down the stairs, which caused my nostrils to bleed frequently. The nosebleeds stopped after I was in my teens, but I had a lot of nasal mucus, which was yellowish-green and smelled fishy. It has not improved at all, and I often feel dizzy. I have consulted with ear, nose, and throat specialists and used washing devices for a long time, but it has been ineffective and very painful. I would like to ask if this disease can be cured and please indicate the treatment method.

[Dr. Gu Yuqi answers:] I am afraid it is chronic rhinitis. It needs to be washed with disinfectant water and Ephedrin or drena-line should be applied to the nasal membrane. The root treatment method is surgery or electrotherapy.

(2) Feng Sensen asked: My daughter is five years old. In mid-May of the lunar calendar last year, she suffered from infantile convulsion, which healed in a few days. However, after healing, she could not walk with both feet, could not speak, and could not hear. It was not until the spring of this year that both feet were able to walk and play, lively and clever, as before. However, she still cannot hear or speak, and all her actions are similar to those of a deaf person. I do not know if she can recover. Please answer in detail: (1) Now that both feet can walk and jump, why can she still not hear or speak? (2) Can this disease be cured and how to treat it?

[Dr. Gu Yuqi answers:] Your daughter's infantile convulsion may be encephalitis or infantile paralysis. It must be examined in detail before a diagnosis can be made. It is best to have a pediatric specialist in a nearby municipal hospital diagnose it.

(3) Huang Yongping asked: Two months ago, I was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis after an X-ray examination. At that time, a pulmonologist diagnosed and prescribed medicine, and then I went to the countryside for recuperation. For three months now, I have become emaciated and feel tired all over, but my diet has not decreased, and I am confident that there is no major problem. However, the family is not very harmonious and I am not in a good mood. I would like to ask if pulmonary tuberculosis must go through the process of coughing up blood? I have not coughed up blood. How should pulmonary tuberculosis be treated? Can I continue to work? What are the obstacles to my body? Please answer.

[Dr. Gu Yuqi answers:] Please immediately use X-ray photography to diagnose whether there are cavities. If there are, you must perform artificial pneumothorax surgery, inject glucose calcium, and vitamin C. There is hope for recovery, so do not be pessimistic.

Inquiring About the Whereabouts of Ge Qiyang

Editor: I deeply admire your newspaper's social services column for solving difficult problems for readers every day. My brother, Ge Qiyang, graduated from the Graduate School of Yenching University in Peiping. In 1937, he was introduced by President Stuart Lei Deng from Peiping to Shanghai to serve as a history and geography professor at the University of Chicago in the United States. He corresponded several times within a year after he left, but communication was interrupted after the start of the Pacific War. There has been no news since the victory, and I am very surprised! I don't know where he is now? Now that Dr. Stuart has been appointed as the Ambassador to China, I have known him since I was a child, but because of the mountains and rivers separating us, I originally intended to go to pay my respects, but I am afraid it is inconvenient. I hope you can help solve the problem, I am very grateful. Sincerely, respectfully, Ge Qizhen (Correspondence address: No. 1, Jiandeli, Beicangmen, Wuxi)

[Editor's reply] This matter is very simple. You can send a letter directly to Ambassador Stuart at the American Embassy in Nanjing to inquire. You should be able to find out the exact news about your brother.

Answering an Inquiry About Land Location

Yesterday, I read Liu Feng's article "Inquiring about the Location of Land" in the Social Services column of your newspaper on August 10. After checking the land deed, the land is located in the 16th map of the 4th district of the 21st security of Shanghai County and still belongs to the scope of Shanghai County. It is in Chenxing District, Pudong (i.e., Chenjiahang, south near the boundary of Nanhui County, which is a temporarily delayed receiving area in this city and is not under the management of the Municipal Land Administration Bureau). According to the word 圩. Number (the same number is not one piece) on the order, single households and certificates of payment of land tax (i.e., the relationship between the commonly known grain skewers and the land list), you can apply to the Shanghai County Government to order the map land to check the location of the land and all the people who have been mortgaged. This is to the Social Services Column, Wang Bingzhong, August 11 (living at No. 20, Lane 65, Gujianong, East Beijing Road, Beijing)

Hygiene and Medicine

### Obstacles to the Public Medical System

— Jia Kui

For the past twenty years, there have been calls from all levels of Chinese society, from the court to the common people, to advocate for a public medical system. The short-lived Ministry of Health and its successor, the Department of Health, have both regarded the implementation of a public medical system as the cornerstone of central health administration. This is because China has a vast territory and a large population, with over 80% of its people being farmers. Their living standards and knowledge of hygiene are very low. Most rural areas have almost no medical facilities. Even Beijing, which has the reputation of a "city of culture," has a deplorable medical situation. According to pre-war statistics, 35% of the city's deaths occurred without any medical diagnosis. If Beijing is like this, the situation in the whole country can be imagined. Therefore, insightful people believe that the only good solution to China's medical problems is the nationalization of medicine—the implementation of a public medical system. However, after twenty years of promotion, although there have been some superficial achievements, there has been a lack of real results. This is due to numerous obstacles. If these obstacles are not thoroughly removed and the path paved, the future of the public medical system is difficult to be optimistic about. If we continue to procrastinate as before, we will not only miss the opportunity but also mislead the country and the nation. This is what those who care about themselves should avoid. Feeling a sense of crisis, I respectfully express my humble opinions.

Private Medical Practice

The biggest obstacle to the public medical system is the current system of private medical practice. Public and private are as incompatible as water and fire. In the current state of health administration agencies and social organizations having no restrictions on private medical practice, while at the same time promoting a public medical system in empty words, is extremely ridiculous. Its lack of success is a natural result. Speakers often argue that public and private medicine coexist in advanced European and American countries. This is a superficial view of those who only know the foreign surface, cutting the feet to fit the shoes, ignoring the national conditions, and must be refuted.

European and American Habits

The private practice system in European and American countries has a long history. Tracing its origins, it is actually a legacy of their capitalism. During the heyday of Greece, medicine had already broken away from theocracy and superstition and entered the realm of science. Medical practitioners regarded saving people as their duty. In the Hippocratic Oath, he repeatedly warned against profiting from medicine. Today, our medical community respects Hippocrates, not only because of his superior intelligence, but also because of his noble character, which can be a model. Therefore, medicine is a science, a learning that should be used to save lives and strengthen the people. Medical practitioners can take it as a job, but not as a business. Therefore, doctors should not be listed as one of the free professions. Unfortunately, at the beginning of accepting Western medicine, our country blindly imitated; the actual effect of strengthening the people was not achieved, and the opportunity for profit was opened; taking its shortcomings instead of its strengths; resulting in today's strange phenomenon in China's medical community, which is truly sad.

Traditional Chinese Medicine

Looking at our country's old doctors, they originally did not charge patients fees, but were hired by pharmacy operators, called "sitting hall doctors" (north of the Yellow River, in Hebei and Shandong provinces), and provided with food and lodging. They were also given an annual engagement gift and a bonus at the end of the year. Patients who asked for a doctor did not usually pay, but purchased medicine from the pharmacy. Therefore, the pharmacy was the one who had a direct business relationship with the patient, not the doctor. The idea was to maintain the doctor's nobility and dignity. This system was very good. In the late Qing Dynasty, this style still existed. Today's old doctors all charge registration fees and consultation fees, so that the former honest style has flowed into commercial malpractices, and they are also poisoned by Western capitalism. Business is becoming more and more prosperous, and medical ethics are declining. How regrettable it is! However, the wrong path is not far, and turning back is the shore. How to eliminate this bad habit and restore the dignity of the past? The virtuous of the medical community, the ruling authorities, should rise up and plan for it.

Since the European Renaissance, capitalism developed first, and scientific medicine revived later. The establishment of public health has only a few decades of history, and the advocacy of the public medical system is even a more recent new facility. Private medical practice has been around since ancient times. Deep-rooted, reform is difficult. However, the medical associations in those countries are well-organized. Where the rule of law does not reach, medical groups often impose sanctions themselves, and the level of medical ethics is quite high. Therefore, medical practitioners must also pay attention to science and have less fraud. Moreover, they are able to assist and serve in public welfare undertakings. Secondly, there are many doctors, and the ratio of doctors to the population is also more reasonable. Although practicing doctors also gather in big cities, there are still many people who are willing to take public office. Although the remuneration of public doctors is usually not as rich as the income of practicing doctors, there is no feeling of a lack of talent. This is very different from the situation in our country.

Qualified Doctors

According to the investigation, there are only more than 10,000 qualified doctors in our country today, which is less than one-tenth of the national needs. At present, there are less than 20 medical schools in our country. Each school graduates an average of less than 30 students per year. Assuming that the number of medical schools doubles in the short term, and each school recruits double classes. Without even asking whether there is a source of students, in twenty years, only 50,000 qualified doctors can be trained. The training capacity is almost saturated, but compared with the national needs, it is far from enough. Then, is it not very difficult to promote a public medical system that builds the country and strengthens the people? The lack of talent is a major obstacle to our country's public medical system. How to intensify training is an important solution, and it is imperative to immediately prohibit the private medical practice system. One is to promote the existing medical personnel to fully serve the public, and the other is to restrain the future medical personnel from flowing into business, so that the country can train a talent and have one more person to serve. In fact, a country as poor and weak as ours must catch up quickly and catch up to gain a foothold. If we must follow in the footsteps of others and let it evolve naturally, the car in front has overturned, and the latter will follow, how stupid is it?

Serve the Public

Some say that although the history of private medical practice in our country is short, the accumulated habits are deep. Moreover, where there is profit, people tend to flock to it. Once prohibited, the response will be great. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the medical community has not yet been mobilized, which can be a lesson. Moreover, with the size of China and the number of people, the government uses limited talents to shoulder the medical affairs of the whole people, which is beyond its capacity. This also seems right, but it is not. The public medical facilities are to popularize medicine throughout the country, promote the health of the nation, and reduce the country's deaths, so as to achieve the effect of strengthening the people and strengthening the country. All descendants of the Yellow Emperor will be happy to follow. The medical community is an intellectual group, how can it be an exception? Since the Anti-Japanese War, national mobilization has only reached a one-sided aspect, and has not yet reached the whole. The medical community is also the same. Those who are conscripted are only the newly graduated medical students every year. Private medical practitioners are not lacking in enthusiastic patriots, but there are many who sigh that there is no way to serve the country. When the mobilization law for health personnel came out, it only stipulated that one person should be conscripted for every dozens of people, but in fact, it was just a formality and has not been universally implemented. Therefore, the reason why the medical community failed to be fully mobilized during the Anti-Japanese War is one of the examples of the failure of mobilization in all sectors of the country. It is not that the medical community is unwilling to serve the public. The great cause of building the country, the people of the country all have a share, why should the ruling authorities make the medical personnel sigh again? Clearly prohibit private medical practice and fully serve the public, this is the time.

As for saying that China is vast and has a large population. The government cannot afford the medical affairs of the whole people for a while. This is not a reason to preserve private medicine, but a reason why our country urgently needs to implement a public medical system. The current phenomenon in our country is that the land is vast and the population is large, but there are not enough doctors. These few doctors are almost all gathered in big cities, forming a deformed development, so that rural farmers have no medical facilities. There is no doctor within thousands of miles in the interior. Before the Anti-Japanese War, there were only six doctors in Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou Province. The people's illnesses are all entrusted to superstition and magic, let alone health care. To correct this kind of deformity, there is no good way except to use political power to promote the public medical system. That is, use the existing talents and do everything possible to gradually advance. It can be expected that it will not be difficult to succeed within thirty years. Speaking of cooperating with the construction of the country, the period of thirty years is too long. If we don't come up with this plan again and let it evolve naturally, then the long night will be endless.

Strengthening the People is Paramount

Revoking the private medical practice system is certainly not without difficulties. However, if we can recognize that building the country comes first and strengthening the people is paramount, then all difficulties can be solved easily. Increasing the treatment of public doctors and enriching medical equipment should be prerequisites. If a workman wants to do a good job, he must first sharpen his tools, and so is the doctor. Therefore, whether it is a county or city hospital, or a health center, the medical equipment must meet the standards. The location distribution of domestic medical schools must also take into account the situation of the provinces and regions, and closely cooperate with the public medical structure to improve its academic atmosphere. Public medical personnel should also have opportunities for further study after a considerable period of work, so that their knowledge and skills can keep pace with the times. As for the treatment, it seems to be a trivial matter. Among the doctors who earn tens of millions of yuan a month, there are only one or two out of a hundred. On average, they are well-fed and clothed, and not in poverty. However, it is also pitiful to be busy all day long, acting like slaves. If we can give them a fair treatment based on the price index in various places. In addition to food, clothing, and education for children, there should also be some savings for emergencies. Increase or decrease the salary according to the relationship between seniority and actual position to seek fairness. If life can be stabilized and work can be guaranteed, most practicing doctors will be happy to abandon their private interests and serve the public. During the Anti-Japanese War, civil servants lacked food and clothing, so those with weak will changed careers, which was a special phenomenon. However, the treatment of public doctors in the future should be better than that of general civil servants. One is because the responsibilities are heavier, and the other is because of the lack of talent. Compared with bank clerks who only handle money and get thick rewards, they cannot be treated the same. What is even more important is that the production and sale of medicines must be nationalized. This can not only reduce waste, but also restrain consumption. Every year, hundreds of millions of yuan of unnecessary losses can be saved. With our country's poverty and the people's suffering, we not only do not deserve to have luxury private doctors, but also should not have wasteful secret medicines. With the nationalization of the pharmaceutical industry, the trend of competing for secret medicines will be fundamentally eliminated. All medical personnel use the same medicines and follow the same procedures, then the division of the domestic medical community into British, American, German, and Japanese factions can be eliminated. Killing multiple birds with one stone, why not do it? However, in the past, the monopoly system focused on tax revenue. The monopoly of medicines should be based on control as the principle and supply as the goal. We must aim to achieve the enjoyment of medical and health care, regardless of wealth or poverty, is equal as the ultimate goal. Public health and medical institutions should be universally supplied. The patient's prescription is limited to being signed by a public doctor. Then private practitioners have no medicine to sell, and patients who go to private doctors have no difficulty buying it. The trend of business can be quickly reduced, what is difficult? It all depends on whether we have the courage to do it!

### The Relationship between Mental and Physical Health

— Liu Yuzi

The relationship between the mind and the body is very close. The former is invisible and intangible, unable to be heard or seen, while the latter is tangible and visible. The close relationship between the mind and the body is like a machine and the electricity that drives it. The machine is tangible, while the movement of electricity is intangible. For example, if a factory only has machines but no electricity, the machines will not run smoothly, which will affect the entire factory's inability to start work, just like a person who has had a mental illness. Although his body's organizational structure is normal, he cannot work. Conversely, if there is good electricity but the machine malfunctions, it is like a person's mental state is good, but his body is too weak and sick. The machine is damaged and needs to be repaired, so the electricity is good but useless. Therefore, the factory must also temporarily stop work. Therefore, a person's overall health is obtained from both mental and physical aspects. A perfect body is like a complete machine, and a good spirit is like full power. Both are beautiful, and the entire factory can start work, and the products can be excellent. Because the spirit and the body are complementary to each other, a sound mind must reside in a sound body. As the saying goes, "A broad mind makes the body feel at ease," and "A solemn mind makes the body feel comfortable, and a solemn mind makes the appearance respectful," all refer to the close relationship between the mind and the body.

There are many examples of the relationship between mind and body in daily life. Taking the example of a cat seeing a dog, in addition to terror, its hair stands on end. This is because its fear psychology occurs first, and then the physiological changes follow. For example, when people are shy, their faces turn red, and when they are frightened, their faces turn white. After hearing ghost stories, the hair on the body cannot help but stand on end. The body develops high fever and chills, which easily leads to bad temper. Furthermore, if the mood is not good, the appetite is immediately reduced, and the appearance is haggard. All these are proofs that the changes in the mind and body are closely related.

Therefore, to seek a complete and perfect individual, it includes both a healthy body and mind. Because if one aspect has defects, it will definitely affect the other aspect as well. Let's take the most common "neurasthenia" as an example. Its symptoms include insomnia, constipation, headaches, weight loss, poor appetite, etc. From the surface, those symptoms seem to be the result of physiological changes, but in fact, after tracing the source and carefully studying the results, it can be proved that those are abnormal psychological effects.

Because from the beginning, we only instilled common sense of physiological hygiene in our minds, so when we get sick, we only want to seek a basis from the physiological aspect. The psychological aspect seems to have never been noticed. It is like when a light bulb suddenly goes out, we only think that the light bulb itself is damaged. In fact, we ignore the reason why the power plant stopped supplying electricity. Therefore, when we check that the light bulb is indeed intact, we should immediately think that perhaps there is no electricity. It is the same as when we examine a patient and cannot find any problems, we should immediately think that it is his psychological effect.

In short, environmental cleanliness, food nutrition, prevention of infectious diseases, and the importance of DDT insecticide are all things that we should pay attention to in physiological hygiene. On the other hand, instilling common sense of mental hygiene, finding the origin of psychological conflicts, understanding ourselves, and recognizing personality are all medicines to promote psychological health. At the same time, we must also keep in mind the relationship between the mind and the body. Therefore, the purpose of "hygiene and medicine" is to promote the health of our mind and body.

### Symptoms of Malaria

— Zhong Xueli

The symptoms of malaria vary depending on the type of malaria parasite, and also depending on the type of onset, the patient's resistance, age, and acute or chronic stage. Mild cases are the common symptoms seen by the public: initially chills, followed by fever, and finally sweating, and then the temperature subsides. Severe cases are dangerous, called malignant malaria, the patient often has a persistent high fever, is unconscious, or has severe abdominal pain, or vomits incessantly, and even dies. Fortunately, the former is the majority in the coastal provinces, and the latter is less. However, malignant malaria is very prevalent in the southwestern provinces of China, such as Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Guangxi. In the past, the medical style was not prosperous? The pathogen is unknown, and it is commonly called "miasma." Most of these "miasmas" are contracted by people from other provinces who have just entered the area. Although scholars also suffer from it, it is not as fierce as those from outside. In the past, officials and merchants who were demoted or traveled often mistakenly believed that it was acclimatization, or even ghosts and gods who were causing trouble, suffered from this miasma, and suffered unexpectedly. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Yunnan-Burma Road was the lifeline of transportation for China's rear, and countless staff along the road were affected by it. The cities of Sifang, Bamo, and Tengchong, which border Yunnan and Burma, have reduced their population and declined in commerce due to the miasma, and the people mostly suffer from anemia, splenomegaly, and incomplete development, which is caused by chronic malaria. The author witnessed the heartache and bribed the summary of the symptoms of malaria to inform the people of the introduction of medical common sense.

Malaria is not only a human disease, but other animals such as chickens and monkeys also have it. Here, we will only limit ourselves to malaria in humans. The most important human malaria can be divided into three types: (1) Tertian malaria, (2) Quartan malaria, (3) Malignant malaria.

These three types of malaria are diseases caused by three types of "malaria parasites." Due to the different types of insects and their different life histories, they also differ in their symptoms. However, regardless of the type of malaria, they all have the following similar characteristics.

(1) Periodicity: That is, each type of acute malaria has chills, fever, sweating, and fever subsided. This is a cycle. Tertian malaria has a cycle every other day, and quartan malaria occurs once every two days. Malignant malaria, the life history of the parasite can vary from 24 hours to 48 hours, so it is less regular. Daily attacks or intermittent attacks are all possible. The duration of chills is generally an average of several tens of minutes to one or two hours. At the time of onset, the patient initially feels tired, limbs are sore, mental fatigue, headache, and drowsy, afraid of breeze, like to enter hot soup, the side of the oven, and even covered with several quilts, still can not resist the cold feeling, followed by trembling occurs, teeth chattering, clattering. At this time, the patient's face is pale, the appearance is haggard, and the nails are purplish brown. The epidermis often shows goosebumps, and the skin temperature decreases, but the body temperature has increased. Then the temperature rises to about 40 degrees Celsius, then the skin color changes from pale to red, and the skin temperature also increases. Headaches often increase, and even often present neurological symptoms and digestive symptoms. The pulse then turns from weak to strong. This is maintained for three or four hours to more than ten hours, and then the temperature drops sharply, accompanied by profuse sweating. Those with weak bodies can not support the profuse sweating. Patients often feel thirsty, and the symptoms of dehydration are also common. Those who have malaria for the first time are mostly cured after the fever subsides, and can get out of bed, except for weakness, there is no other suffering.

(2) Paroxysmal: If it is tertian malaria, it mostly does not have fever on the second day, and the fever recurs on the third day, reproducing the symptoms described in the previous section, cycle after cycle. If not treated with medicine, it can occur paroxysmally about ten times, lasting for two or three weeks, until the patient's natural resistance gradually produces and naturally stops. Quartan malaria is more stubborn, and it is not easy to control the attack on the fourth day. Malignant malaria also has this paroxysmal nature, but its periodicity is not very obvious. This should also have a trend of natural control, and it also takes two or three weeks.

(3) Recurrence: If the patient in the acute phase is not treated, or is not properly treated, they will enter the chronic phase from this acute phase. The characteristic of this period is repeated recurrence. Most patients with chronic malaria often recur after labor or accidental exposure to wind and cold, or after surgery for other diseases, when their natural resistance is weaker. At this time, patients mostly present with symptoms of anemia, such as palpitations, dizziness, vertigo, easy fatigue, mental depression, indigestion, and even edema, shortness of breath, etc. If a physical test is done, these patients often appear emaciated, children's development is stunted, the face is pale, the whites of the eyes are jaundice, the spleen is enlarged and firm, and the liver is also larger. Patients with severe anemia have heart enlargement and systolic murmurs. In addition, there is pleural effusion, ascites, and systemic edema. Generally speaking, quartan malaria has the most obvious recurrence, which can last for two or three years; tertian malaria is second; the recurrence period of malignant malaria is about one year. If treated with quinine or atabrine, malignant malaria and quartan malaria are easier to control with drugs, and tertian malaria also responds after medication, but it is still easy to relapse after recovery.

As for the symptoms of malignant malaria, in addition to the above, there are many variations. It is difficult to predict whether it will occur once a day or every other day, and there are many fierce types of attacks. It can resemble a variety of non-malarial diseases and common diseases, and doctors often feel thorny in the diagnosis.

Malignant malaria has an uncertain fever type, and does not necessarily have a cycle. If the onset is slower, the fever persists, and it is very similar to typhoid fever. Or the onset is sudden and rapid, the fever is persistent, the whole body aches, the face is red, and the conjunctiva is congested, which can resemble the initial spotted typhus or relapsing fever without spots. Or the body temperature rises and falls sharply and uncertainly in one day, then it can be misdiagnosed as kala-azar. Or with severe abdominal pain, abdominal muscle stiffness and tension, it can be misdiagnosed as appendicitis or other intra-abdominal surgical diseases and surgery is performed. Sometimes the patient has abdominal pain and diarrhea, and the stool contains blood and mucus, which is very similar to dysentery. Or it presents with deep jaundice and incessant vomiting, which is very similar to cholecystitis, cholangitis, and hepatitis. Or it is coma, convulsions, delirium, and dementia, which is very similar to encephalitis. Or it presents with symptoms of meningeal irritation, which is similar to meningitis. Or with mental disorder and nonsense, it is mistaken for neurological patients. Or the edema is severe, the urine is reduced, and it contains red and white blood cells, which is very similar to nephritis. There are also patients with urticaria. All of these are special manifestations of malignant malaria. Therefore, the diagnosis of malaria depends entirely on the symptoms, which are often prone to error. It is necessary to repeatedly check blood smears in order to be sure.

Spring and Autumn

Novel

### Liu Si's Illusions

— Chen Lun

In a desolate valley, a new railway stretches forward, winding around mountains and rivers, like a living giant python crawling towards a place unseen by the human eye.

This is undoubtedly a heavy stroke of the "Develop the Northwest" paintbrush, a great, magnificent, solemn, and powerful stroke dipped in the blood and sweat of many living and dead.

Beneath each sleeper of this new road, it seems, there is a soul supporting it. Leaving this memorable mark is truly not easy!

Because it is a new road, accidents often occur. Derailments, landslides, crashes, people being crushed to death… these are common occurrences.

Like a parasite, Liu Si attached himself to the "track maintenance crew" along the edge of this road to earn a living. But Liu Si's task is precisely the opposite of that of a parasite, because he is the true "young nanny" who maintains and repairs this road.

Liu Si is a homeless Henan native from the Huangfan district. Actually, who doesn't have a home? It's not like Liu Si sprang from a mountain crevice. However, according to Liu Si, his home was washed away by the Yellow River in a twilight. Although this is a great sorrow, even now, when he brings up his family, Liu Si becomes sad for a long time. But this gave Liu Si a carefree life. Otherwise, who would carry a head on two shoulders and wander into this desolate valley? If he hadn't come here, how could this great work of "developing the Northwest" have fallen upon his own head? To be honest, losing his home naturally gave Liu Si a good opportunity to move up.

Liu Si is content with his work. Every day he follows the foreman along the roadbed to inspect it. They carry iron pots, shovels, picks, large crowbars, track gauges… carefully searching for any non-standard defects in each section of the roadbed, each sleeper, each rail, and each small part: like a bowl repairer carefully searching for the lost spare drill in a pile of dirt in front of him, they patiently rack their brains to find every small defect, so that every non-standard place can be modified, and tens of thousands of passengers can have their lives secured. But despite Liu Si and his colleagues getting up early and going to bed late, and pouring all their efforts onto these parallel rails, accidents still frequently occur, and they have fallen into a deep web of melancholy.

This day, as the bronze-colored sunset slipped behind the ridge of the western mountains, Liu Si followed his colleagues, dragging their melancholic and heavy steps, to knock off work. The work exhausted them, and they slowly lumbered back to their temporary home like old oxen, ringing the dull copper bell to send off the evening. After dinner, Liu Si pulled out a tattered bamboo mat and lay under a tree in front of the track maintenance hut, lost in thought. He meditated carefully, like corrupt and fraudulent officials lying by the lamplight in a dark room, thinking about ways to fleece the people. Liu Si narrowed his eyes and used all his brainpower to think about measures to ensure traffic safety.

The evening breeze, like the soft and tender fingers of a young lover in Zhang Ziping's novels, caressed Liu Si's chest, but Liu Si had never had such a "romance," nor did he think about that. However, the fatigue of the day, the invisible rope that bound him, was blown apart inch by inch by the evening breeze, leaving him feeling comfortable and refreshed.

As the sound of snoring arose from his companions around him, Liu Si vaguely heard faint voices speaking not far away. Although the voices were not loud, there were sighs, frustrated breast-beating, fierce rebuttals, and even threatening speeches in the voices; like listening to Peking opera on a crystal radio, although the sound was small, it was complete with all the roles of male, female, painted-face, and old male performers. He couldn't help but feel strange. He pricked up his ears to listen carefully, as if someone was holding a meeting and reviewing something. He felt even stranger, so he drifted up and hid behind a large locust tree, wanting to see clearly and hear the whole story. Before he could stand steady, he saw at a glance a large group of material spirits arguing fiercely about something. At this time, the locomotive boss, with eyes like a poisonous dragon, screamed a few times and already left the meeting. The lonely track spike boy, still staring with a pair of small black bean eyes, fixedly stared in the direction the locomotive left. He said to everyone in frustration:

"How many times has the boss looked at me with arrogant and contemptuous eyes, thinking that I am an insignificant character that can only be seen under a microscope, not worth a penny. Sometimes he even scolds me emptily, and even roars at me from time to time: saying that I am a useless rice bucket, saying that I am the number one piece of garbage in the world. Who knew that the other day, our track spike partners, because of a moment of pique and a slight slack, he derailed and went astray. This is truly self-inflicted! Let's say, for example: even if we are rice buckets, we can still hold rice for everyone to eat, and serve everyone. Compared to those heroes who step on people's heads and shout for society and for humanity, we feel much more at ease, right? Although our track spike partners are all born with congenital deficiencies and acquired imbalances, and are born with a pitiful appearance that is thin and dark, we can sell a foolish strength and have backbone, which is much stronger than those big-bellied and hard-skinned bloodsuckers, right? The derailment of this locomotive is a severe punishment for him. If he is still obsessed, then we have to all change our careers and make other plans."

"Hehe! That's how trains derail. I need to pay special attention to this at work," Liu Si thought to himself while eavesdropping, working on his mental calculations.

Next, the steel rail Mr., whose face was pale from being crushed, made a big fuss:

"Hey, you are still being persecuted indirectly, but only I am directly enduring his torture. Every day, he strides across my back with an air of arrogance, chest out. Come and see, the black skin on my back is peeling off layer by layer, and that kind of pain is truly unbearable…" As he spoke, he opened his arms and turned sideways to show everyone his wounds, implying endless feelings of sorrow. He took a breath and continued: "…Not only does he not give me a bit of comfort, but he often yells and scolds; and our buddies on the curves are even more miserable. Every time he passes there, he presses them so hard that they squeak and screech like the sound of grinding teeth. How can we live through this dark and hopeless life? So, the other day, when the track spike boys relaxed a little, we took the opportunity to spread out and rest our legs. So the locomotive, which looked so majestic and like a temple utensil, derailed. This is truly unavoidable, and as far as I'm concerned, it's well-deserved."

"Yes, yes! It's really well-deserved!" Many material spirits echoed in unison.

Later, the sleepy old Mr. Sleeper also reported the tragedy of his companions, saying that the sacrifice of his partners was truly an unexplained death, a truly meaningless sacrifice. They hadn't committed any major mistakes. Why, when the locomotive got angry, did it pour down piles of slag and poisonous fire and use cruel fire torture on them? Should there be such a penalty in the world? In the 20th century now, this is very unreasonable. Finally, he asked everyone to avenge those of his partners who were burned with scorched heads and broken backs and arms, and vowed to provide support, notifying the locomotive that the same thing should not happen again, and devising a way to inform the station to set up an ash pit to maintain the permanent peace of the material spirit world. After speaking, he wiped the sweat from the tip of his nose and sighed softly for a while. Everyone, of course, echoed in unison and agreed.

At this time, the Miss Track Plate, whose face was blue with anger and pale, because she was shy and kind and didn't want to show off in front of people, didn't express any opinions, just hid under the sleepers and cursed softly on both sides; finally, the fishplate bosses, thick as palms, and the screw and bolt sisters also expressed their respective opinions. Everyone unanimously agreed that the locomotive's fascist behavior should be overthrown.

"Hehe!" Liu Si laughed secretly in the dark, laughing at this group of foolish material spirits for being too stupid and ridiculous. He thought in his heart: "This is our human affair, how can you blame the locomotive?" He was thinking about something when suddenly someone was talking again. He looked up and saw that it was Mr. Steel Rail who was making a conclusion:

"Everyone!" Mr. Steel Rail stopped briefly after calling out "Everyone," seeming to want to attract everyone's attention, and then continued: "Based on the reports everyone just made, we can say this: every material spirit, like a person, if you want to do something, you can't do it by relying solely on your own abilities. For example, let's compare it to a human body. It's not enough for a person to just grow a head. Once you have a head, you also have to grow eyes, otherwise, living blindly is so painful. With eyes, you also have to grow a nose to specialize in breathing. If you only breathe, you can't get enough nutrition, you also have to grow a mouth to eat things. After eating things, you have to digest, absorb, and excrete, so the five internal organs are indispensable. Without limbs, of course, it won't work, but the human body is composed of countless tiny cells that are invisible to the human eye. If there are no cells, the human body can't be organized at all, so how can you ignore them? Everything is coordinated with division of labor and cooperation, and you can't despise or ignore every small organ, small joint, and small part. Not only that, but you also have to carefully maintain them and nurture them in order to unleash great power. The same principle can be extended to a group, a society, and so on. If you understand this, you will be safe and sound, otherwise you will be confronted everywhere. The recent train derailment was because of the arrogant locomotive…" Mr. Steel Rail spoke to this point in one breath, and he was so excited that he couldn't stand it. Suddenly, he heard the sound of "kongtong kongtong" coming from far to near. He looked up and saw the locomotive, with its huge eyes like two poisonous dragons, gradually galloping towards him. He couldn't help but panic a little. He waved to everyone, as if telling the material spirits, "That hateful thing is coming at us again, let's temporarily hide for a while and then talk!" He left without speaking. The material spirits were all ridiculing his timidity. Liu Si also hid behind the tree, echoing his laughter. Just then, the train had reached the front, and it seemed to have derailed again. Because the train was going downhill at this time, it couldn't stop for a while, and it crashed straight into the tree where Liu Si was hiding. Liu Si wanted to run away, but it was too late. He suddenly felt a jolt and escaped from the dream with a palpitating heart.

He rubbed his eyes, calmed his heart, and looked at the distant sky. It was just the dawn of the morning. The morning breeze was blowing gently, and his companions were still snoring sweetly. He opened the door of memory and let the rope of thought tie back everything in the dream. He couldn't help but smile: "Strange! How could I have such an unimaginable strange dream last night?" He reviewed the scenes in the dream one by one. He sympathized with them, pitied them. But he also felt that this was an absurd and nonsensical strange thing.

"Do some materials have souls?" He asked himself.

At breakfast, they set off to work again. On the way, Liu Si told everyone about his strange dream last night and asked them to pay special attention to the looseness and instability of the track spikes, because in a section, if there are several loose track spikes, it can easily cause derailment, which is something that cannot be ignored. They worked very enthusiastically today as usual. The three express trains in the morning passed this section very safely.

At noon, they were paid. After doing the calculations, each person received a salary of 23,000 yuan. After deducting 14,000 yuan for food and zero expenses, each person only received two or three thousand yuan. So, issues such as clothing, eating, supporting a family, and making a living… all flooded into their minds. The enthusiastic and tense work mood in the morning was squeezed out by the torrent of life and turned into nothing. Each of them held two new banknotes, looked miserable, shook the banknotes with a rustling sound, and muttered:

"What's going on? What's going on? This life is killing us!"

Someone joked to Liu Si:

"Liu Si! We are also 'rice buckets' of the track spike class that can only be seen under a microscope. We care about the railway every day, and even plan maintenance and repair work in our dreams, striving to ensure the safety of the lives of tens of thousands of passengers. If the railway is damaged, we care about maintenance, repair, and improvement, but what about our lives… alas, who cares about us?"

"Uh, uh!" Liu Si stared and couldn't answer a word.

### Zheng Manqing's Flowers

### Sounds of Annoyance

— Zhong Yuan

I often ask my friends, why is my surroundings filled with sounds of annoyance all day long?

As soon as I open my eyes in the morning, a string of piercing "Mommy, Mommy" flies over. It's a sick little girl from the neighbor's house. Her grandfather died, her mother followed someone else, and she's left with a sixty-year-old blind grandmother. In the morning, the blind old woman gropes to the stove to cook bran porridge, and the child curls up on a tattered mat, calling out "Mommy" miserably.

The sun rises high, and the clock in the living room strikes nine. Not early, not late, a beggar with a broken leg will crawl past my window, knocking his head with a thud and crying out loudly, "Madam! …Miss… Save the poor! …Starving to death!…"

In the afternoon, the faint sunlight shines into my room, and Sister Zhang from across the street comes as usual, with her withered yellow face and a handful of tears and snot, nagging me over and over again, "Miss, there's no hope for his illness anymore! …No fields, no property, six children left behind, how am I going to live!…"

At dusk, in the quiet small room, Old Man Chen's white beard trembles under the lamplight. He sighs, "Alas! Life is impossible! …Living to be seventy years old and still having to be a beast of burden! …Alas! Even being a beast of burden isn't enough to eat your fill! Alas, alas!…"

Annoying! This "Mommy, Mommy," this "Madam, Miss," this "How am I going to live," this "Alas, alas,"…

From sunrise to sunset, my ears are filled with sounds of annoyance. I can't stand it, I'm begging my friend for help.

But my friend said that these sounds of annoyance are the flowers of life, decorating the monotonous world and enriching the souls of poets. Afraid that I wouldn't believe it, my friend made a metaphor, saying, "Don't you like to appreciate many moving and praiseworthy poems and essays? If there were no these sounds of annoyance, how could poets and writers write those moving and praiseworthy poems and essays?"

Is my friend's words right? I don't know. But from then on, although I am still afraid of these sounds of annoyance, I love to read all the moving and praiseworthy poems and essays even more, but not for "appreciation," but for "chewing."

### An Inch of Mountain, a Drop of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

Although this place is small, it is quite important militarily. It is the throat of the Pinghan Railway, and a small railway connects to Fengtai. From Fengtai, one branch goes straight to Tong County, and the other goes through Zhoukou and directly to Tianjin. Lugou Bridge and Wanping are nearby. A little past the northwest is Mentougou, and it is only thirty miles away from Beiping. Not to mention trains and cars, even if you pick a good horse, it only takes a short time.

Our house is just west of the iron factory, separated by a small hillock. It used to be inhabited by an engineer, but he found it too secluded and moved into the factory. I went to school with this engineer for a year, so it was easy to rent it.

Once evening comes, it is as quiet as a tomb here. But sometimes it is also very noisy, with broadcasts, excerpts from plays, "Arise, arise, ye who refuse to be slaves," etc. But this is a fabricated noise, a trained noise; in other words, this noise is exactly the cover or disguise for our work.

After the lights come on, we don't need to make noise anymore. And in this tense moment, we are very unwilling to make noise.

Sure enough, just as Hejian Yu was pacing around the house, a faint cannon sound suddenly came. Hejian Yu stopped immediately. He had received rigorous training and was as alert as a police dog. In less than five seconds, there were two more sounds. An expert could tell that these were the sounds of Japanese small field guns.

As soon as Hejian heard the second cannon sound, he immediately ran to the door, lifted the curtain, made a gesture to the outside, glanced at me, strode to the head of the kang, opened the tree cabinet, reached out and pulled out a pair of headphones, put them on his head, and took out a small microphone, while turning on the machine button. His movements were so agile, his gestures so skilled and clean, and his expression so calm and composed that it was truly admirable.

"Number thirty-five… seven zero seven… one one… —Number thirty-five… seven zero seven… one one…" Although he was calling out numbers, he still maintained a beautiful Beijing accent.

The equipment installed in the cabinet is the latest German-style two-way wireless telephone, which can also receive broadcasts of various frequencies. The whole machine weighs only six or seven pounds, and when folded, the exterior is just a small handheld leather package.

"Number thirty-five… seven zero seven… one one… Hello… Uh… one six one… headquarters…" The phone was already connected.

At this time, the cannon fire was getting tighter and tighter, and occasionally a few sounds of machine guns and rifles could be heard.

After a while, Hejian finished the phone call, took off the headphones and microphone, closed the tree cabinet, and returned to sit opposite me. There was no trace of the tension just now. He knew that I was waiting for the news from his phone call.

"Old Yue," he opened his mouth and smiled slightly, as if unwilling to reveal the news: "Old Yue, you see how much of a bastard!"

I didn't quite understand who this "bastard" was referring to. In short, this news was absolutely unimportant, but 100% certain. Normally, there were four common languages between us: if the matter was important, we would use Japanese military jargon, short and clear. In our duties, we have always used our mixed language, interspersed with obscure language. I am not very familiar with the obscure language; this is his own ingenuity, using the most familiar classical or idioms in Japan, mixed in the communication language, the meaning is mostly the opposite of the original meaning. Ordinary people who heard it, although they understood it, only thought it was a trivial sentence. The third kind of language is used on formal occasions, that is, pure Tokyo language. When he is relaxed and happy, or when he needs a few witty remarks to embellish, he can also speak a authentic Northeastern dialect, or Beijing dialect. In addition, he can speak all the words of cursing and cursing people in various parts of China.

### Whispers Under the Dim Lamp

— Shao Fu

Listening to five or ten minutes of music is like taking a bath in a bathtub, but the latter washes the body, while the former washes the heart.

As for those low-level and vulgar music, they are only disgusting.

Schools are scarce, and entrance exams are even more difficult. The children of many friends are running around like ants on a hot pot these days. I remember that in the English test paper of a university in Shapingba, Chongqing, two years ago, there was a large candlestick, with four lines of poetry attached below, the words are as follows:

I have no such talent,
Others asked me to come;
Not a single word of English,
Draw a candlestick.

A special dispatch from this newspaper in Beiping stated: a qualified person said: taking the football game as an example, Marshal Ma and Situ, the two elders, are no longer referees, but have become footballs that are kicked around. Although the joint statement is not the sound of a bursting football bladder, it is at least an expression of impatience.

However, kicking around, one day it will be kicked into the goal. I wonder if the two elders can be patient for a little longer?

Chu Minyi's wife repeatedly applied for a retrial. This is called "treating a dead horse as if it were alive." It is actually uncomfortable to breathe two more breaths in the world.

The divorce case between Yang Xiuqiong and Tao Berlin has not yet been resolved. These two news—death and separation—people tend to associate together.

The film industry is unwilling to participate in the election of the queen;

The drama industry is also unwilling to participate in the election of the queen;

The Yue Opera industry is also the same;

Is it because there is no emperor?

Glass

### Shanghai

— Youfu

"Glass reflects the heart of Shanghai people, but Shanghai people don't want to see through it!"

Glass penetrates Shanghai, glass sees through Shanghai. Every twist and turn in the guts of Shanghai people is clearly illuminated by the glass mirror.

Any company you go to invariably uses glass as its symbol. Glass products: raincoats, suspenders, belts, women's handbags, combs, shoes, socks, watch straps, mirrors, cigarette cases, cigarette holders, bedsheets, clothing materials, holsters, hot water bottles... What we see are glass items, and what men and women wear and use are glass items. In just a few months, Shanghai has become a flashy glass world.

These kinds of glass items are indeed often of good quality and reasonable price, but people who buy glass products don't do so entirely for good quality and low price. (In fact, many glass products are not cheap.) Their purpose: everyone is rushing to be modern, how can I be an exception? At the very least, I have to buy a glass belt to use, even if it's a Jewish product, as long as it looks like glass, otherwise, I really won't be content.

Using glass products is everyone's freedom, and I certainly don't dare to nitpick, but there are many, many people whose income is not sufficient, but they still insist on being modern and fighting for face, which is quite pitiful. And if they buy a glass belt but can't match it with other clothing, it's even more painful! To put it bluntly, those who don't need to use glass products force themselves to get something made of glass in order to chase after vanity. In fact, a person's beauty is not in their appearance; it includes physical health, a kind heart, and intellectual fulfillment. If you already have a good belt, why bother buying a glass belt just to keep up with fashion? In fact, to be frank, glass products are popular in Shanghai, but they are already the most outdated in America. Glass reflects the heart of Shanghai people, but Shanghai people ultimately don't want to see through it!

Recently, it's said that America has produced the first glass car. It's said that it was designed and manufactured by many engineers before the war. The designer of this car is Mr. William Stout, a highly experienced airplane and car designer, so he called this glass car the "Stout Scarab."

How happy the nouveau riche with money must be when they hear this news! I hope Mr. William Stout of America quickly speeds up production, produces in large quantities, and ships them to Shanghai for those gentlemen, ladies, and young ladies to use. Otherwise, they will be so anxious that they will jump up and down like ants in a hot pot.

However, young men and women who can only afford glass belts and glass handbags certainly admire glass cars, but their hearts are willing, but their strength is not enough, which adds another layer of pain.

Today in China, half the people are suffering, and half the people are joking and chasing after vanity.

Glass sees through the hearts of Shanghai people, but Shanghai people themselves don't want to see through it!

Shanghai made of glass, be careful, one day it will break!

### Worshipping the Old Boss

— Mo Su

Early Monday morning, as usual, I went to the office to work, waiting for the tram at a certain tram stop. At the same time, there were three newsboys, the oldest around twelve or thirteen years old, and the youngest only about ten years old. Each held a stack of newspapers and shouted to customers to buy. I prepared to buy a Shen Bao from the youngest newsboy. As I paid the money and the boy was reaching for a Shen Bao to hand to me, suddenly, the older boy snatched the newspaper from his hand with a snap. The newsboy was so anxious that he almost cried. I was a bit confused, thinking it was a business dispute, so I scolded the older boy, saying, "Buying a newspaper is my freedom; I can buy from whomever I want. How can you be so rude?" The older boy glared and angrily said, "Selling newspapers here is divided into territories. He (pointing to the younger boy) is not from our territory. How can he be allowed to cross the line and steal business?" Hearing this, I couldn't help but feel emotional and angrily shouted, "What territories? Chinese affairs are ruined by territories. You're so young, and you already have territories in your minds. No wonder you have endless infighting over territories." The older boy became even more enraged and said, "We all worship the Old Boss. He doesn't worship our Old Boss! I'll go get the Old Boss." Saying that, he pulled another slightly older newsboy and hurried away, turning into a certain alley. After a while, the two boys came out of the alley, followed by two typical "old boss" figures, wearing matching open-collar black gauze short shirts and pants, with a long white silk belt tied around their waists. One of them, who was taller, held the Shen Bao that had just been snatched in his hand, with a very unpleasant expression, walking towards me menacingly. I thought they must be looking for trouble. I needed to catch the tram to the office, so I didn't have time to argue with them. If I suffered a loss in front of everyone, I would be ridiculed by the many bystanders. I deeply regretted meddling. But the two old bosses had already approached, spouting nonsense. I had no choice but to steel myself and reason with them, hoping to subdue them with words. Unexpectedly, before I could speak, the taller old boss widened his eyes and said with a stern face, "Who dares to challenge the local tyrant? I've been eating and drinking in this territory for over a decade. Whoever wants to share my leftovers will have to answer to my fists." As he spoke, he rolled up his sleeves and cracked his knuckles, displaying the style of a hooligan. I thought to myself that I had met a brute, and reasoning was useless. The situation had become tense. At this moment, the younger boy whose newspaper had been snatched, began to cry again. Just then, a tall man suddenly emerged from behind me, scolding in a Shandong accent, "What are you? Territories? Open your eyes and see what era it is!" I heard two crisp "smack" sounds, and the old boss was slapped twice on the face. The performance was very swift and decisive. The onlookers clapped and cheered. The other old boss who came with him pulled the beaten old boss and said, "Boss, give the newspaper back to the kid. Let's go find Grandpa to talk to them." The beaten old boss threw the newspaper on the ground, turned around, and ran away. At this time, the tram arrived at the stop, and passengers swarmed on board. I also boarded the tram. The man from Shandong patted me on the shoulder and said with a smile, "Old brother, to talk about peace, you still have to rely on force. Reasoning is useless!" I expressed my deep gratitude and returned a knowing smile.

Crowds in front of the White House, watching the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court's inauguration.

### Two Scientists

— Zheng Zhitang

A friend told me this story: A French scientist, after his research, announced to the public, "The moon and the earth are going to collide." When people heard this news, they were very surprised. But the people of Paris simply indulged in entertainment; they spent huge sums of money to eat, watch movies, and dance, preparing to die after enjoying themselves.

A Chinese scientist in Paris, without doing any research, announced to the public, "The moon and the earth will not collide." As a result, many people visited him and asked him for his reasons, but he kept saying, "I know they won't collide." In the end, he bet a large sum of money with the French.

When the day that the French scientist announced the moon and the earth would collide arrived, the moon and the earth really did not collide. As a result, the Chinese scientist got a lot of money. At the same time, many people visited him again. This Chinese scientist said, "I don't need to do research to know they won't collide. Don't you think so? Even if they were going to collide, wouldn't everyone die together? I wouldn't have to take out money, and you couldn't say to me, 'You were wrong...'"

### A Smile

— Frozen Wei, translated from Corner

"Children, do you remember what I said last week? That you should do something to make others happy this week. How many of you have already done it?" the teacher asked.

A child happily raised his hand and said, "Teacher, I have done it."

The teacher praised him, "Very good, how did you do it?"

The child replied, "I went to visit my aunt May. When I said I was going home, she was extremely happy."

### Outside the School Gate

— Yang Yurun

Four children, A, B, C, and D, were squatting by the corner of the wall, gathered together playing a "game" of cards – sand crabs. They were deeply interested and mentally tense. Suddenly, the "all-in" bet in front of child A was lost to the "flush" in child B's hand. So:

A (anxiously snatched a torn old hundred-yuan bill from B's hand, stood up, and said to B): "Convinced or not?"

B (jumped up from the ground, grabbed A's left hand holding the bill): "Not convinced! What are you going to do?"

A: "Humph! I'll flatten you..."

B: (made a fist with his right hand, extended his middle finger, and put it in front of A): "Here..."

A twisted B's hand in response; and then, the two started fighting...

C (counted the money in front of him while laughing loudly at A and B): "Haha..."

D (sat leisurely on the ground, hugging his knees with both hands): "Good! Energetic!"
