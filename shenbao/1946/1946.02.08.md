### General Commander-in-Chief He Stresses That the Communist Army Should Observe the Ceasefire Order and Restore the Railways in North China in a Press Conference in Nanjing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] At the press conference of the Army Headquarters today, Commander-in-Chief He answered the following questions from our newspaper reporter: (Question) According to people from Shandong and other places, the Communist army is obstructing the restoration of traffic. What is the reason? (Answer) It is said that the Communist army has proposed to the military mediation headquarters the requirement of joint control of the railways in North China, as reported in the newspapers. (Question) Has the Communist army at Taian station not obeyed the order to withdraw from the station? (Answer) Not yet. (Question) The Communist army has not complied with the second communique issued by the military mediation headquarters in many cases, such as obstructing the progress of road restoration projects, which has greatly harmed the people. What kind of countermeasures will the military mediation headquarters take? (Answer) It is reported that the military mediation headquarters has requested instructions from the higher authorities in Chongqing. (Question) It is reported that the people trapped in Taian, Lincheng, Zaozhuang, and other places are lacking food. Can the headquarters suggest to the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to quickly allocate some flour and transport it for relief? (Answer) Yes. (Question) What are the difficulties currently facing the military mediation headquarters in carrying out its mission, other than transportation? (Answer) The military mediation headquarters advocates that the troops in the conflict areas should retreat to their original positions before the 13th of last month. The National Army has no objection to this, but the Communist army has occupied some cities after the ceasefire deadline and has not yet complied with the order to withdraw.

[United Press, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] General He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, returned here by plane after inspecting Xuzhou. Today, he told reporters: Our side has cooperated in urging the Chinese Communists to repair the railways in North China. Brad, the American representative of the Beiping Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, has gone to Chongqing to consult with the representatives of the Chinese Communists on this matter, hoping that the Chinese Communists will abide by the ceasefire order and restore traffic, so that Japanese expatriates can evacuate, compatriots displaced by the war can return to their homes, and food can be transported to remote areas. I can guarantee that the troops under my command have absolutely obeyed the ceasefire order, remained in their original positions, and stopped firing. However, sporadic conflicts continue to occur everywhere. The responsibility for this is self-evident. The National Army maintains its defense. If the Communist army does not attack again, conflicts will not occur. The surrender of Japanese troops and their repatriation have been delayed due to traffic interruptions, especially in Shandong, Shaanxi, and Hebei provinces. The punishment of Japanese war criminals in China will not be carried out for the time being, pending the drafting of a complete list of war criminals. The work of deciding who is a war criminal is proceeding slowly, because China's war of resistance has been so long, and the Japanese commanders have changed several times. At the same time, the investigation is conducted with few records available for verification. However, the Chinese authorities have detained the former Japanese ambassador to the puppet government and one commander of the army and one commander of the division. Traitors will be arrested upon public accusation, and their crimes are worse than those of the Japanese and should be severely punished. Pseudo-military personnel will be tried by military courts, and other traitors will be tried by ordinary courts.

Regarding the Executive Headquarters' power to restore transportation, whether it's the same as in stopping the conflict, the Chinese Communist Party's spokesperson replied, "Yes." The roads are mostly calm at present, and the materials needed for the railways are not as difficult as imagined. If there are no obstacles, all the national railways can be restored to traffic before the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee on March 1st.

Editorial

### Britain Controls Investment in Lenovo

Reuters Telegraph: The British House of Commons has passed the Investment Control Act. While the details of its contents are not fully detailed, the Chancellor of the Exchequer stated, "This law is a method of curbing speculation. If the abuse of capital is not prevented after this war, a chaotic situation will be inevitable." It can be seen that this bill is a necessary measure to regulate floating capital and curb speculation.

This makes us think of the investment situation in our country after the war. Taking Shanghai as an example, although the organization of various new enterprises has gradually begun to emerge, and this newspaper has repeatedly compiled and published them, from the perspective of the entire economic circle, the number is still very small. Moreover, judging from the nature of the business, they are all import and export industries, warehousing, insurance, transportation, securities, and real estate, with very few light industries, let alone heavy industries. A large amount of capital, turning east and west, I am afraid it will still not escape the path of speculation. The first goal is of course gold, US dollars, Chinese and foreign securities, and the second is goods such as cotton yarn. Most of them are still the so-called "kicking the ball" nature, circling in the trading market, not completely selling out, let alone production. In other words, if the situation of investment in China after the war does not change, there is no investment at all, but speculation!

Since the restoration, the cattle have been loaded. Although the currency system cannot be said to be completely stable, at least the inflation is not as severe as in the past, but the intensity of price fluctuations is more severe than during the war. Although the reasons for this are more than one, the fanaticism of speculation is the most direct main reason. Therefore, the surging labor unrest, the difficulty of life, and the general social unrest can be said to be the gifts of rampant speculators. Why is speculation so fanatical? It is nothing more than the fact that floating capital in the market has not yet found a proper destination. As the British Chancellor of the Exchequer said, if the abuse of capital is not prevented after this war, a chaotic situation will be inevitable. We believe that our country's capital has long been abused, and the chaotic situation has already occurred, and it has occurred very widely. However, we have not yet heard our "Chancellor of the Exchequer" come up with any concrete measures to control investment and curb speculation. In these areas, China of the Three Principles of the People seems to be inferior to capitalist Britain, which is truly embarrassing for us!

Judging from the current situation of speculation frenzy in China and its harm to society, then should we imitate Britain and control these floating capitals to prevent their speculation from doing evil? We feel that cracking down on certain transactions (such as prohibiting illegal trading of government bonds and stocks), distributing certain materials (such as truly selling sealed materials at reasonable prices), and returning or selling a few small factories in small amounts are really not effective measures. Because these methods are not enough to allow those floating capitals to find a proper destination, they cannot reduce the fanaticism of speculation.

To achieve the above objectives, we believe that this method is also very common, and it is not necessary to completely copy the successful methods of other countries. If we can quickly achieve the following points first, there will be some hope.

(1) No matter whether the exchange rate is set high or low, it should be decided and announced as soon as possible so that the import and export industry can recover, then there will be a way out for commercial capital.

(2) The factories received in various places (not limited to Shanghai) should be returned as soon as possible, sold as soon as possible, state-owned factories should be opened as soon as possible, and leased as soon as possible to operate, so that the chimneys of various factories can emit smoke and the machines can turn. Do not "occupy the pit and not shit" and seal it for a long time without tearing it off, then there will also be a way out for industrial loans.

(3) The sealed materials should be returned, sold, given priority purchase, or publicly bid for, and everything should be cleared and decided as soon as possible in accordance with the regulations. Do not delay any longer. For example, the remaining cotton yarn from the robbery, according to the appeals of the industry, the request for return seems to be justified and reasonable. If it is correct, it should be affirmed; if it is wrong, it should be rejected. In accordance with reason and law, it should be reviewed and approved as soon as possible. Do not hold a meeting today, review it tomorrow, and still put it on hold after three or five months. As long as the materials are circulating, the need for chips will be even more urgent, so where will there be any floating capital?

(4) Restore transportation, smooth cargo transportation, so that goods from various places can flow steadily from water and land transportation lines. At the same time, financial institutions in various places should quickly and widely resume operations to facilitate commercial deposits, withdrawals, and remittances, so that financial and commercial activities between various places will gradually prosper, then there will inevitably be more funds needed for financing.

(5) Restore law and order, and abolish all kinds of harsh and miscellaneous levies, so that the lives and property of the people in various places can be protected, then the wealthy people who have taken refuge in Shanghai can hope to return to their hometowns with their assets, and the floating capital in this city will naturally be dispersed to various places.

The above measures can be said to be humble and not too high-sounding. It is not necessary to enact specific laws like Britain to control investment. It is only necessary for the government to make up its mind and implement them separately, and the current situation of speculation and chaos can be resolved by at least half. Fortunately, the Political Consultative Conference has come to a successful conclusion, and all parties have promised to cooperate. We believe that there will be solutions to politics in the future. If there are solutions to politics, then there will of course be solutions to law and order, transportation, finance, etc. The speculation and chaos of the past few months can always be gradually eliminated.

There is only one point that the central and local authorities must not think that the Consultative Conference has ended, the government must be reorganized, and everyone should have the psychology of a five-day magistrate, delaying what should be done quickly. It must be known that a small disease that is not treated can become a serious illness over time. If the evil of the speculation market is not rooted out when the waves first rise, it will eventually flood and cause a major disaster. We do not want the authorities to be only guests who try to put out the fire after the house is burned down, but we hope that they will quickly come to bend the chimney and remove the firewood.

### The Situation in Northeast China is Increasingly Complex: "East Mongolia Autonomous Government" Suddenly Announces its Appearance; the Issue of Soviet Troop Withdrawal is Being Negotiated and Handled

[Report from our newspaper in Beiping on the 6th] The situation in Northeast China has become increasingly complex in the past two weeks. According to reliable sources, an organization called the "East Mongolia Autonomous Government" was established on January 15th in Wangye Temple, the capital of the former puppet Manchukuo's Xing'an South Province, and announced the independence of the "East Mongolia Republic" in its National Congress. The chairman of the government, Uljei, is a Buryat Mongolian general affiliated with the Soviet Union. This news was delayed due to transportation issues and only reached here yesterday. Relevant authorities have reported it to the central government. It is understood that East Mongolia refers to the two leagues of Juu-Zolt and Jirem, and its area includes most of the three provinces of Xing'an, Liaobei, and Rehe in Northeast China. The newly established East Mongolia Autonomous Government has designated the red flag as its national flag, with a yellow sickle and a shepherd's whip inlaid on it, indicating that it is an agricultural country. It has approximately 20,000 to 30,000 cavalrymen, which were reorganized from the puppet Manchukuo's Xing'an Province cavalry. The military leader, Li Wentong, has become the backbone of the government. The political party is the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, led by Tong Xiwen, and the party flag is red with a yellow Mongolian character "寿" (longevity) on it. Currently, the government is actively training Mongolian youth and assigning them to work in various places. The first phase has graduated, and the second batch is being trained. It is rumored that Chairman Uljei graduated from the Soviet Army University and holds the rank of general in the Red Army. (Note by the reporter: Buryat is a branch of the Mongolian banner located around Lake Baikal in Siberia).

[Report from our newspaper in Chongqing on the 7th] It was originally decided that Soviet troops would withdraw from Northeast China at the beginning of this month, but it has been delayed again. Currently, the main personnel taking over are coming to Chongqing one after another to ask for instructions, and all actions are confidential, and they are tight-lipped.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 7th] It was learned here yesterday that the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Northeast China is being negotiated and handled in both Moscow and Chongqing.

[United Press, Chongqing, 7th] According to news from Beiping, Chiang Kai-shek's headquarters will be maintained in both Changchun and Jinzhou, and the Northeast Headquarters Political Committee will hold its first meeting in Beiping on February 10th.

[United Press, Beiping, 7th] "Yi Shi Bao" reported that the Changchun Railway is currently being "freely operated by the Allied Soviet Union." The Soviet Union has widened the tracks to be equal to the Siberian Railway, thereby connecting the transportation between Northeast China and the Soviet hinterland. The Soviet army has postponed the withdrawal date to March 1st.

The ruling classes in certain countries, encouraged by imperialism, are prepared to wage a third great war. There are no such warmongering adventurers within the Soviet Union. Those who truly uphold peace and security should know that the Soviet Union is a steadfast ally and a pillar of security."

### American War Crimes Tribunal: Trial of Ishihara and Miki Ordered, Remanded for Scheduled Retrial

The five-member committee formed by the American War Crimes Tribunal yesterday morning, at the American Military Tribunal in Tilanqiao, conducted the trial of two Japanese war criminals: Ishihara, a translator, and Lieutenant Miki. The trial began at nine o'clock, with Ishihara being tried first. Ishihara, 36 years old, served as the chief translator at the Wusong and Jiangwan concentration camps during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai. He was accused of using various cruel tortures to abuse American prisoners in the concentration camps, such as waterboarding, beatings, and inhumane torture that caused them to lose consciousness. Today, the American military charged him with seven counts. The prosecuting attorney was Captain Gurney Landt, and the defense attorney was Captain Mollerly. The defense attorney requested a two-week preparation period, which was granted, so a retrial is scheduled for a later date. At half past nine, Miki was tried. From 1942 to 1945, Miki worked in a concentration camp near Shenyang. During that time, 1,200 Americans were imprisoned there and subjected to Miki's abuse. He also killed an American expatriate named Jones. The American military charged him with nine counts. Today was the preliminary hearing, and he was remanded for a scheduled retrial.

Commercial News

### Rumors Fuel Buying Spree: Gold Prices Rise Steadily, Sichuan Banks Provide Continuous Supply

Yesterday, reports of the American [unclear character] and gold exports stirred up a buying frenzy, regardless of the veracity of the news. Rumors of "Sun Yat-sen notes" circulated, and major players in the industry scrambled to buy, hoping to squeeze out the Sichuan bank's short positions, leading to successive price increases. The market opened in the morning carrying forward the previous day's momentum, rising to 1.13 million. Initially, the market was relatively flat, but later, with concerted boosting by gold industry groups and the pursuit of retail investors, the price gradually rose from 1.125 million. The 1.21 million mark saw considerable back-and-forth, but ultimately, with strong investor sentiment, the price surged to over 1.23 million at noon. Sichuan banks aggressively sold into the rally, with the noon close at 1.22 million, a sharp increase of 153,000 from the previous close. In the afternoon, the price briefly hit a high of around 1.24 million, with Sichuan banks providing a substantial supply, and credit gradually tightening. The price ultimately retreated to around 1.19 million. Current futures contracts were traded, but not extensively. Gold ornaments were priced at 130,000, silver ingots at 1,200, and silver dollars also rose to around 690. Credit tightened yesterday due to speculative funds concentrating on gold stocks, with interest rates around 10% to 14%.

The US dollar market thrived alongside the gold market, with the premium over gold widening to over 710. Many people sold gold to buy US dollars. The market opened in the morning at 1,610, struggling significantly throughout the day, and rising to 1,720 at noon. However, in the afternoon, it declined along with the gold price to around 1,680, resulting in an increase of 80 compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars remained sluggish as before, although the premiums on new (1) and (2) series were slightly higher. Old notes were unchanged, new (2) series were up slightly at 2 yuan, and (1) series were unchanged.

### Stock Market Surge Continues

The Chinese stock market continued to flourish. Driven by major players in the securities industry, there were hopes for further price increases in various stocks. However, some speculative funds moved towards gold bonds, causing several market setbacks. Overall, Mayar was more popular than Wing On, with active profit-taking. Small-cap and obscure stocks were also highly profitable. Wing On opened in the morning at 2,560, retreating to 2,320 after the opening, and rising to 2,630 at noon, with the noon close at 2,560. Mayar opened in the morning at 1,850, declining from 1,890 to 1,720 after the opening. At noon, it broke through the 2,000 mark, reaching 2,030, with the noon close at 1,950. King Fook opened in the morning at 115, retreating from 120 to 107 after the opening, and then breaking through 120 again at noon. As a result, Wing On was up 140, Mayar 120, Xinhe 40, and King Fook 10, compared to the previous close. Other stocks also rose by about 10%.

The external environment aided buying, and speculative funds flocked back. From the opening, large and small stocks were being snapped up by securities firms and money shops, and foreign investors also re-entered the market. All stocks closed at high prices at noon, with results showing increases of 10% to 20% compared to the previous close.

### Government Bonds Hit New Highs Again

Since government bonds turned positive from lows the day before, major players have actively pushed prices up. Yesterday, rumors in the gold market [unclear character] further fueled buying. Class C bonds opened in the morning at 2,050, with supply exceptionally scarce, rising to a new high of 2,270, before turning sideways. However, the bid-ask spread was very wide, resulting in greater price fluctuations. The overall trend fluctuated between 2,150 and 2,250, with the noon close at 2,220. Compared to the previous close, Class A and B bonds each rose 60, Class C bonds 270, Class D bonds 70, and Class E bonds 140. Major players flocked to popular issues, resulting in relatively weaker gains for less well-known bonds. There was some absorption by foreign investors, and the trend was particularly strong.

### Both Japonica and Indica Rice Rebound

Rice prices rose due to the rebound of gold, strengthening investor confidence. Japonica, Indica, and glutinous rice all rebounded by 400-500. Flour also added 400-500. The oil market was weak but rebounded, up by 1,000. However, soybeans remained flat, and soybean cake rose slightly, up by 100. Cottonseed cake was brisk due to fuel demand, soaring by 500.

### Spinning and Weaving Prices Continue to Increase: Yarn Market Sees Strong Buying

Yesterday, the yarn market saw a sharp rebound. Although few customers made purchases, the industry's appetite was very strong, and the market saw strong buying, sweeping away the lethargic situation during the previous day's red market. This upward surge was entirely caused by the previous day's sudden increase of 10,000-20,000 in the list price of the Spinning and Weaving Company. 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn traded at 700,000, an increase of 50,000. 20-count miscellaneous brands rose by about 40,000. 42-count yarn was particularly popular, rising by 100,000. Weaving factories heard that the list price of the Spinning and Weaving Company's 42-count variegated yarn increased by another 40,000 yesterday afternoon, and it is expected that the yarn market will be even stronger today.

### Silk and Satin Rise Together

Yesterday, the silk and satin market was stimulated by rising gold prices and rose. Artificial silk 120-Day Bridge spot goods were quoted as high as 1.45 million, with transactions at 1.38 million, and a final price of 1.4 million. Warehouse warrants soared with the spot goods, with transactions at 960,000-970,000 and later at 980,000. Due to the extreme shortage of 120 miscellaneous brands, prices were on par with the Tianqiao brand. Factory managers hoarding goods were reluctant to sell, resulting in prices but no transactions. Silk fabrics followed the raw materials higher, with market prices made. American Yaxin quilt covers were quoted at 1.02 million per hundred for buying and 1.05 million for selling, but no transactions were made. Dachen Gege brocade was made at 3,340 per yard, Minsheng brocade at 13,000 per piece, and Linji wax feather yarn traded at 1,300 per yard.

### Tung Oil Red Market Pricing Agreed

The Tung oil red market was only priced yesterday. Originally, it was sufficient to supply foreign sales, but domestic sales oil is also called Tung, so the pricing does not distinguish between domestic and foreign sales, and the average price is 60,000 per market. However, the market is dominated by foreign firms, and although domestic sales are said to be in season for spring sales, the quantity is actually not as large as foreign sales, so market ups and downs still depend on the prosperity of foreign sales. As for Hongjiang Tung oil, the genuine Xihong has disappeared for eight years. Although several companies have resumed operations, the goods have not arrived, so it cannot be priced. The pricing discussed today is the locally produced Hongjiang Tung oil, with the price of each barrel being 47,800 yuan.

### Launching a Ruthless Attack on Decadent Music

— Ke

I am puzzled and deeply perplexed that in Shanghai today, after the victory, we still have the pervasive broadcasting and circulation of "decadent music" that contains narcotic and poisonous elements!

Every time, on the streets, in the theaters, and especially every day at home when listening to music records broadcast on the radio, I am constantly assailed by things like "I Want You," "Don't Leave Me," or things like "Seagull" and "A Toast to My Love"; and even hear them several times a day. Not only does it disgust me to the extreme, but I am also made dizzy by them! How can Shanghai, which is supposedly "concentrated with musical talent," still have the same old face? Are the musicians of Shanghai (the real musicians) really willing to let the dregs of music—jazz songs—continue to run rampant like this for the long term?

"Victory is not rest." Indeed, victory is even less a return to the distorted prosperity of song, dance, and extravagance, but rather requires us to redouble our efforts in all areas to complete the arduous task of national reconstruction. Otherwise, our country, which is ranked among the strong nations, will still be a "gilded lily" on the outside, leaving an embarrassing appearance!

Speaking of Chinese music itself, it is still stuck in a nascent stage. Other countries have "Symphonies," what do we have? Other countries have "Operas," what do we have? Other countries have produced great musical masters like Beethoven and Wagner, who have we produced? We don't need to discuss these backward situations much, everyone knows them. It is more a question of how to establish our national music from now on, how to establish the orthodox music that our country and nation needs, which is undoubtedly the effort expected of our musicians, the more enthusiastic advocacy and assistance expected of our wise government. I think this is an urgent and meaningful task.

Therefore, first I suggest—

Launch a ruthless attack on "decadent music"!

First, I urge the government authorities to quickly ban these "decadent music," destroy these poisonous records. We do not completely lack majestic, inspiring, and patriotic songs, nor do we completely lack sublime art songs, and in Shanghai there are places to record records. I urge the authorities in charge of cultural propaganda to quickly record these kinds of songs, replace them, and distribute them to various radio stations and theaters.

Second, I urge the government to investigate the producers of these poisonous songs.

We all know that the "composers" of these poisonous songs are mostly traitors of the "music world," who not only speculate and numb people's minds, but also willingly spread poison and whitewash peace for the enemy puppets.

After clearing away these obstacles, it's time to talk about our own efforts:

First, I urge our composers and performers to recognize their sacred task, to produce more so-called "Chinese-style" musical works that are suitable for our national conditions and needs, and to play more of these kinds of musical works; not just playing Beethoven's "Eroica Symphony" and "Fate Symphony," Chopin's "Waltzes" and "Serenades," and Liszt's "Hungarian Rhapsodies" today; and still playing these sublime pieces that the Chinese don't easily understand tomorrow. Although Chinese musical works are nascent, but after you play them for everyone to enjoy with your skillful techniques and profound cultivation, you cannot say that they will not have any effect at all. At the same time, I urge the musicians not to harbor any prejudices and to "musicians despise each other," but to cooperate sincerely and work together under the single banner of "establishing national music" to create and work hard.

Second, I urge the government authorities and people from all walks of life to attach importance to and enthusiastically promote music. There is no need to talk about the old clichés like "how important music is" and "how music is related to the future of the nation." Everyone can provide a satisfactory explanation. However, according to what I have personally seen, in today's Shanghai, where the level of culture is quite high, almost every concert is sparsely attended. Such a lack of enthusiasm, such coldness and desolation, the income of a sublime concert is not only not comparable to that of a movie, but not even comparable to that of a *bengbengxi* (a type of local opera)! Stirred by the scene, it pains me to say this! We cannot say that it is not because people from all walks of life do not understand and do not attach importance to musical art, and that the government authorities do not advocate it enough. Therefore, in order to help establish and develop our national music, on the one hand, we must ask people from all walks of life to pay attention to music, because it is a sublime art, which can not only "change customs and habits," but also cultivate character and temperament; on the other hand, we must ask the government authorities to advocate it more enthusiastically, cultivate more musical talents, and mobilize meaningful musical activities. Then, this will not only be a ruthless blow to "decadent music," but also a thorough and effective one.

### The Old Man Selling Sundries

— Ren Jun

——One of the Street Ballads

Dong-dong, dong-dong, dong-dong...

An old white-haired man selling sundries comes running over——

Shaking a long-handled small drum in his hand,

Carrying a huge cargo box on his back,

(Bigger than his body by three or four times!)

Looking like a little ant

Carrying a golden blowfly,

Or a small piece of meat.

Dong-dong, dong-dong, dong-dong...

He runs and shakes with effort,

Sweating profusely

Still calling out his wares incessantly.

Old white-haired man!

Steady your steps,

Straighten your back,

Beware that the "burden of life"

Crushes your old bones!

### A Couple Flying Together (12)

— Zhao Qingge

After Mo Sheng had prepared the dishes, Old Master Mo and Old Master Weng began to drink together. Old Master Mo always downed his cup in one go, while Old Master Weng was more interested in smoking than drinking. Smoking was to Old Master Weng as drinking was to Old Master Mo. His philosophy was: tobacco could cloud his consciousness, so he wouldn't think about too many things. In the life of swallowing clouds and spitting fog, he could live dimly and peacefully.

"By the way, Big Brother, did you call me here for anything else?" Old Master Weng remembered that Mo Sheng had told him that Old Master Mo had something to discuss with him, so he asked this.

"It's nothing else. Last night I had a strange dream, and today there have been many ominous omens. I'm very suspicious in my heart, so I specially invited you here to help me interpret it."

After Old Master Mo finished speaking, he drank several cups of wine in a row, and then tried hard to recall the scene in the dream, and told Old Master Weng in detail about the things he had encountered today, and he especially emphasized some of the phenomena of this newborn daughter, narrating with a doubtful tone.

"How can there be such coincidences in the world? I dreamed of a bird like a yellow oriole flying out of my body, and then today I gave birth to a daughter; and after she fell to the ground, when she cried, it was exactly like the cry of that bird in the dream; and when I saw her for the first time, she cried out in the same voice. Don't you think that's strange? I thought to myself: maybe a demon reincarnated? When people are unlucky, all kinds of unlucky things can happen. Because of this, I was unhappy for a long time." A painful expression appeared on Old Master Mo's face again.

"Haha..." Old Master Weng laughed after listening. After a while, he said without thinking, "You are simply being driven crazy by your wife——" At this point, he quickly lowered his voice. "What's so strange about that? Usually, don't we often compare girls to birds? You dreamed of a bird flying out of your body, isn't that a verification of the birth of your precious daughter today? Since their voices are the same, then maybe your daughter was indeed a bird in her previous life, and now she has been reborn as a precious daughter. You can't even say your daughter isn't an ordinary person! Big Brother, let me congratulate you with a drink!" After saying that, Old Master Weng filled a glass of wine and drank it all in one gulp with Old Master Mo.

"As for you saying that the bird looks like a yellow oriole, according to my guess, my niece will definitely have the advantages of my wife when she grows up——"

Before Old Master Mo could let him finish speaking, he quickly asked:

"What 'advantages'?"

"She can hum a few lines of Peking Opera or something." Old Master Weng smiled and made another predictive explanation.

"Oh!" Old Master Mo replied with a half-believing and half-doubting sound. But after thinking for a while, he couldn't help but ask.

"Then, why does she cry as soon as she sees me? Could it be that we two, father and daughter, have no connection?"

### Students from Other Provinces Come to Shanghai to Study: Exploring the Advantages and Disadvantages of Maritime Schools, Extravagant Aristocrats Are Indeed Unacceptable

Dear Editor: I have only recently come to Shanghai from the countryside, so of course I don't know anything about Shanghai. There are so many schools in Shanghai, making it even more unclear which schools are good? The quality of the school is very important for the future of the students. In order to be cautious, I specially ask your newspaper to indicate which middle schools in Shanghai West are better, and are not for the children of extravagant aristocrats, because the tuition fees of those private schools are too expensive for ordinary students to afford. Your newspaper has always aimed to serve society, and will definitely be able to tell the readers. It will be extremely fortunate! Sincerely, A Shanghai West Reader: Ming Lukuan

(Editor's Note) You say there are many schools in Shanghai, but actually there are not many. Because the population of Shanghai is five million, the number of students enrolled is of course considerable. But at present, the number of people who are out of school and the illiterate are everywhere. The reasons are very complex, but there are still too few schools. That is the first point. The quality of the school cannot be criticized in general terms. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, due to financial difficulties, lack of materials, simple equipment, poor teachers, abnormal teaching and management..., it was difficult for general schools to be run well. After the restoration, the education authorities thoroughly rectified and gradually improved the various past situations, and school affairs are expected to improve. That is the second point. As for the so-called extravagant aristocrats, I think that after rectifying the style of study in the future, there will definitely be no more of these bad phenomena. The tuition fees have been stipulated by the Education Bureau and have a certain standard. This is the third point. As for which school in Shanghai West suits your taste? That's hard to say too. Please read the enrollment advertisements of various schools in this newspaper, and you can do whatever you want.
