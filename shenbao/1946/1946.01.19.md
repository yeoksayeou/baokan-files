### Political Consultative Conference to Discuss Constitutional Draft Today; National Assembly Issue to be Handled by a Subcommittee

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] The Political Consultative Conference held its eighth meeting on the morning of the 18th at 9:00 AM. The agenda: (1) Continued discussion of the National Assembly issue, (2) Constitutional draft issue. However, due to the lengthy discussion of the National Assembly issue, the constitutional draft discussion was postponed to tomorrow. (Details of the eighth meeting and Mr. Chen Lifu's views on the National Assembly issue will be published in the third edition tomorrow.)

[Another dispatch] The military subcommittee of the Political Consultative Conference held a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 18th in the National Government's lounge. The government organization subcommittee held a meeting at 4:00 PM in the National Government's conference room.

[Another dispatch] The ninth meeting of the Political Consultative Conference is scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 19th to discuss the constitutional draft issue.

[United Press, Chongqing, 18th] The Political Consultative Conference held a meeting today and did not approve the planned convening of the National Assembly on May 5th of this year. It was referred to a subcommittee for handling. Zhou Enlai, the Chinese Communist Party representative, opposed the current organizational law of the National Assembly, stating that the Assembly was full of Kuomintang representatives.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 18th] The Political Consultative Conference today held a heated debate on the validity and legality of the National Assembly representatives elected in 1937. It is expected that a compromise will be decided by a subcommittee to increase the number of representatives from various parties and factions. The final conference will be held tomorrow, at which time the draft constitution will be passed. The subcommittee will present a review report on the five major guidelines of the Political Consultative Conference, which is expected to be passed by the conference. Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai opposed the old representatives but said, "I do not wish to endanger national unity because of this." If the problem cannot be resolved, "I am willing to make considerable concessions." Luo Longji, representative of the Democratic League, proposed a voting method to decide whether National Assembly representatives need to be re-elected. He requested that the old candidates hold a general election and that the new constitution be subject to a referendum. Kuomintang representative Chen Lifu said that one-party rule officially began in 1924 and has now come to an end. He pointed out that the British Parliament continued to meet during the war and never stopped.

[Another dispatch] The Chinese Communist Party today submitted a ten-point plan for Chinese constitutionalism to the Political Consultative Conference, advocating that all parties establish a national government of people's freedom and democracy under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, and engage in agricultural, financial, educational, and industrial reforms. After the Kuomintang and the Communist Party disagreed on the issue of National Assembly representatives yesterday, the Consultative Conference began discussing the constitution. The central government intends to convene the National Assembly representatives elected ten years ago, while the Communist Party believes that new representatives should be elected, and then the Kuomintang's tutelage can end. The Communist Party's resolution on the constitution requires: (1) The speedy establishment of a constitutional government under Chairman Chiang, democratizing politics, nationalizing the military, and granting all parties equal legal status. (2) Guarantee of people's freedom. (3) Expansion of the government. (4) Election of new National Assembly representatives. (5) Local autonomous governments. (6) Reorganization of the National Military Council to unify military orders. (7) Immediate demobilization and reconstruction. (8) Financial and economic reform. (9) Cultural and educational reform to eliminate illiteracy. (10) Concluding treaties with various countries to promote international peace.

[Our newspaper, Chongqing, 17th] The members of the military inspection group to be selected by the National Political Council will continue to be nominated by the Standing Committee of the Political Council at the next regular meeting. As for the departure date, the members of the Political Consultative Conference and the members to be nominated by the Political Council are not all present, and it may still be necessary to wait for some time in Chongqing. As for the detailed inspection methods, no written notice has been formally received to date.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 18th] Mo Dehui arrived in Tianjin from Peiping at noon on the 18th, and after a brief delay, returned to Peiping to go to Chongqing.

### The Three Groups of the Mediation Department Depart to Work in Jining, Chifeng, and Jinan

[Our newspaper, Peiping, 17th] (1) The Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Department is scheduled to dispatch three peace groups today to Jining, Chifeng, and Jinan. According to news from the 12th War Zone, the Communist army continued to attack the county seat of Jining in eastern Suiyuan on the 15th. Communist personnel stated that General Du Yuming's troops continued to advance westward, and fierce fighting was underway near Chifeng. Therefore, the Executive Headquarters sent personnel to mediate. (2) The Executive Headquarters has held meetings for several days, but has not yet moved into the Union Medical College Hospital to officially work. The department is scheduled to host reporters at 4:00 PM on the 18th. (3) A group of staff members flew in from Zhangjiakou yesterday, but there is still a shortage of personnel, making it difficult to officially work immediately. (4) The Executive Headquarters has set up a news team. The American representative is Burton, the government representative is Ji Zejin, a section chief with extensive experience from the International Propaganda Department, and the Communist representative is Miss Peng, a diplomatic reporter from Xinhua Daily. She is usually active among foreign reporters in the International Propaganda Department in Chongqing.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 18th] Colonel Leake of the Jinan Executive Group of the Military Mediation Department, Colonel Tu Shuwu, staff officer of the Military Affairs Department, and Ma Jinqiao, the Communist representative, along with twelve attendants, flew to Jinan from Peiping at 1:30 PM on the 18th. After getting off the plane, they went to the office location to start working immediately.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 18th] According to a certain newspaper here, the Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Department issued a warning to the Communist army in Jining, eastern Suiyuan, stating that if they still do not obey orders, the headquarters will take "effective measures." The newspaper said that the Communist army attacked the west gate of the city seven times on the evening of the 16th of this month and the next morning.

[Associated Press, Peiping, 18th] American observers stationed in the Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Department took off by plane this morning to inspect various parts of China and correct troop movements that violate the ceasefire order. It is understood that the areas to be corrected today include a portion of the Gubeikou area along the Great Wall and the area around Zhangjiakou, a stronghold of the Communist army. The Military Mediation Department is dispatching a three-person team by train to Gubeikou to correct the situation of the positions along the Great Wall.

[United Press, Peiping, 18th] Personnel dispatched by the Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Department to issue ceasefire orders have encountered serious restrictions for the first time. These personnel are not allowed to go to the Northeast, and their scope of activities is also limited in Jehol. Colonel Dutilot of the U.S. Army and his team have gone to Chifeng. The second team was originally planned to be sent to Chengde, but it has now been abandoned, reportedly because the airport facilities there are poor and not suitable for U.S. transport planes to land.

The Northeast issue is obviously very complicated. Although the military cessation of hostilities order has been issued by both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, Yingkou was recently occupied by the Communist army again. This matter has become the focus of discussion at the Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Department. Since the nine eastern provinces are no longer within the scope, the extent of the Executive Headquarters' authority in Jehol is now facing a serious test. The department has dispatched a reconnaissance plane to Gubeikou to investigate. It is reported that there are still conflicts there, and the Executive Headquarters will send personnel to go there. Other mediation personnel have arrived in Jining, Suiyuan Province, and Jinan, Shandong Province. These personnel are equipped with radio equipment and have six or seven transport planes in preparation for their return to Peiping.

There are already eighty government representatives and nearly one hundred American representatives in the Military Mediation Department here. The Communist representatives have not yet arrived due to transportation difficulties. A group of Communist representatives arrived here from Zhangjiakou and Yan'an on two planes, but the total number of Communist representatives is still less than fifty.

### National Highway Conference Presided Over by Minister of Communications Yu Penfei

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The National Highway Conference was held in Nanjing today. Minister of Communications Yu Penfei and Vice Minister Xue Zhui will personally preside over it. It is reported that there are five central issues: (1) Establishing a national highway system, (2) Expediting the repair of highways in the recovered areas, (3) Reorganizing highway operations on all lines, (4) Cultivating management talents and establishing a new atmosphere, (5) Encouraging private operation and opening up restrictions on commercial vehicles to facilitate the flow of goods and normalize prices. Furthermore, the Shanghai-Nanjing Highway has been repaired to Zhenjiang, and the entire line is expected to be open to traffic within a month.

### Jiang Menglin to Go to Nanjing to Promote Reconstruction Work

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] In order to promote reconstruction work, strengthen preparations for the return to the capital, and quickly review all pending cases in the recovered areas, the Executive Yuan has appointed its Secretary-General Jiang Menglin to work in Nanjing on a permanent basis. Mr. Jiang will fly to Nanjing from Chongqing before the 25th of this month. According to political figures who have already come to Nanjing, after Mr. Jiang arrives in Nanjing, not only will the work of the various departments be easier to promote, but also the preparations for the return to the capital are expected to shorten the schedule by one or two months.

### Jiang Jingguo Flies from Peiping to Changchun; Our Security Forces Begin to Deploy in the Shenyang Area

[Our newspaper, Peiping, 17th] Jiang Jingguo flew back to the old capital from Chongqing tonight. He is optimistic, and he has a good impression of Moscow. Beyond that, he refused to say anything. Tomorrow, Mayor Shen Yi will fly to Changchun to prepare for taking office. Chairman Gao Xibing, who has been in Peiping for two months, recently bought two famous paintings and is appreciating them alone in his hotel to relieve the melancholy and loneliness he brought back from the Yalu River. A few days ago, he was eager to go to Changchun but was dissuaded. Mayor Dong Wenqi of Shenyang fell ill in his hotel as soon as he took office. When the national army arrived in Shenyang, his illness suddenly disappeared. The chairmen of the three provinces of Hejiang, Heilongjiang, and Jilin are still waiting for orders in Changchun. Wu Huanzhang, Chairman of Xing'an, has not yet taken any steps to take over in Peiping. It does not seem to be unfolding at an alarming speed. The occupation of Yingkou by the Communist army seems to have some impact on the current situation in the Northeast.

[Our newspaper, Peiping, 17th] According to relevant sources, the Soviet army is scheduled to withdraw from Changchun on the 20th, and our security forces have begun to deploy in the Shenyang area. Furthermore, Jiang Jingguo flew to Peiping from Chongqing tonight and is scheduled to fly to Changchun on the 18th.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 17th] Today, another fourteen planes brought a batch of airborne troops.

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 17th] Shen Honglie flew from Peiping to Jinzhou previously and is stationed at the headquarters. In addition to summoning personnel from the central ministries and commissions in Jinzhou to handle the takeover work, he conducted a preliminary inspection of the takeover matters. In recent days, he inspected the former Dongmian Textile Factory and the former Manchurian Synthetic Fuel Factory in Jinzhou. In the afternoon of the 17th, he visited the city of Jinzhou, and in the afternoon, he went to Huludao to inspect the Jinxi Cement Plant and the Siping Fuel Plant, and other important factories such as the Jinxi Manufacturing Plant. He is scheduled to inspect the Huludao port and wharf on the 18th to prepare for future repairs. The opening of the port of Huludao was personally completed by Mr. Shen.

[United Press, Washington, 17th] The State Department and the Chinese Embassy announced today that they have not been able to confirm reports from Jinzhou that the Soviet Union has requested the Chinese government to jointly manage commercial airports and heavy industry in the Northeast.

### Financial Institutions Resume Operations One After Another; Harbin's Economic Situation is Prosperous; Counties in Songjiang Province Urgently Need Agricultural Implements and Cotton

[Central News Agency, Harbin, 18th] Since the provincial and municipal administrations were successively taken over here, the economic situation in the city has been improving, and the financial sector has been particularly active. During the puppet Manchukuo period, there were five government-run financial institutions and eleven private ones in Harbin. After August 15th, business was mostly disrupted due to the disorder of social order. After the entire municipal administration was taken over, in addition to the government-run puppet Central Bank being taken over and opened by the Central Bank, the Yifa, Gongcheng, Guomin, and Jewish banks among the private banks also resumed operations one after another. The Soviet Union's Far Eastern Bank also opened at the old site of the Yokohama Specie Bank. Due to the flexible financial sector and the improvement of public security, commerce and industry are gradually recovering. According to the manager of Yifa Bank, since the bank resumed operations on January 7th, it received more than ten million in deposits in just one week. Recently, the average daily deposits received have been over one million five hundred thousand, which is approximately equal to the amount of deposits received in one year during the puppet Manchukuo period. With the Lunar New Year approaching, goods and vehicles from the surrounding villages are streaming to the city, and all kinds of goods are on the market in a timely manner. The prosperity of commerce is no different from peacetime, and it is expected that there will be more rapid development after transportation is restored.

[Central News Agency, Harbin, 16th] Since the Songjiang Provincial Government took over, representatives from various counties have come here to report on the local situation. The most urgent issues that all counties feel need to be resolved are spring plowing and cotton. In the past fourteen years, they have been unable to support themselves due to the ruthless exploitation by the Japanese. They feel particularly embarrassed after the recent turmoil. Moreover, iron agricultural implements were confiscated by the Japanese and no longer exist. Therefore, they earnestly hope that the authorities will provide agricultural implement loans, transport cotton, and distribute agricultural implements to farmers to facilitate cultivation.

[Central News Agency, Siping, 16th] Yesterday, Jianzhong dispatched personnel to take over an oil and chemical plant here, renaming it the Liaobei Provincial Oil Refinery. The plant has not stopped working since August 15th. It currently only produces kerosene and can produce ten tons per day. According to the investigation, the raw materials for the plant can still be maintained until May of this year. Furthermore, the Siping Municipal Government also dispatched personnel on the same day to take over the "Toyo" and "Kangde" flour mills to prepare for resuming operations.

### After the Deadline for the Cessation of Hostilities Order, the Communist Army's Novel Strategies: "Troop Rotation," "Taking Over Defense," "Pleading for Mercy"

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The executive work of the Military Mediation Department can be described as heroic. Yesterday and today, naval planes carrying a large number of ceasefire orders were seen flying at low altitude over the Communist army positions in Guanzhou Zhaian and other places at great risk. It is not possible to predict what the reaction will be today. However, according to the engineering personnel who are rushing to repair the railway in the northern section of Jinpu, the Communist army's novel strategies after the announcement of the ceasefire agreement have confused and troubled the military and civilians in Shandong, making them both amused and annoyed. The actual situation is as follows: (1) "Troop Rotation": After the Communist army successfully ambushed the national army, they notified the national army, stating that they were ordered to take over the defense and asked them not to misunderstand. Now that there is a ceasefire, they will stop fighting from now on. The events of yesterday need not be taken into account. The reason for their announcement to the public is also "taking over defense." (2) "Taking Over Defense": After the Communist army successfully ambushed the national army and took over point A, the national army had to comply with the ceasefire order and withdraw to point B. The Communist army then took advantage of this and launched another attack. At this time, if the national army is slow and deliberate, reasoning with them and sending personnel to question the Communist army, the Communist army will also reply politely in a letter, explaining that they were actually ordered to take over the defense, and if they do not retreat, they will be responsible for the consequences. (3) "Pleading for Mercy": If the Communist army's ambush of the national army is unsuccessful and their reinforcements are not sufficient, they will be frustrated and ashamed, and they will shamelessly plead for mercy from the national army, claiming that they did not come to attack cities and seize land, but were forced to do so due to lack of food and clothing. They asked to borrow some clothes, food, and legal tender. This is the most inferior of the novel strategies.

### Our Materials Stored in India Will Be Shipped to Shanghai Successively

[Central News Agency, Calcutta, 17th Special Dispatch] The committee for receiving our materials stored in India has begun working here. The first batch of materials, approximately six thousand tons, is expected to be fully loaded at the docks here in the middle of this month and shipped to Shanghai on two British freighters. It is hoped that more than two shipments can be made per month thereafter. Based on the current shipping situation, it is expected that all the materials can be shipped from India to Shanghai in approximately four months to half a year.

### Guangdong's Foreign Trade is Increasing Month by Month; Customs Duties Exceed 30 Million Per Month

[Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 17th] Since the resumption of international trade here, foreign goods have been pouring in and native goods have also returned to normal. Foreign trade is increasing, so customs duties are increasing daily. Huo Qiqian, Customs Commissioner of the Guangdong Customs, told reporters that the revenue in September of last year was approximately four million yuan, which increased to five million six hundred thousand yuan in October, then to thirteen million yuan in November, and exceeded thirty million yuan in December. This shows the active results of foreign trade after the liberation of Guangzhou.

### Anhui Rice Prices Tend to Fall

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Yang Cuncun, a representative from the Grain Department of Southern Anhui, came to Nanjing and requested that the authorities reduce the original quota of three million piculs of military grain to be purchased in Anhui by one million piculs. This news has been passed on to Wuhu by the representatives, and the people of Anhui are greatly relieved. It is reported that rice prices in Wuhu and other places in Anhui are trending downward.

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 16th Special Dispatch] It has been learned from reliable sources that the Siamese government has requested to exchange ambassadors with our country and that our country send five consuls to the current administrative area of Siam. Li Tiezheng has conveyed this to our government and is awaiting instructions. Sino-Siamese diplomatic negotiations have entered their third day today. The two countries have not yet discussed formal diplomatic issues such as the education of overseas Chinese children and our immigrants. Today, they began to raise heated discussions on both sides. The current negotiations will conclude a Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship, which has not existed in the two countries for nearly two centuries. Although China and Siam have had friendly relations in the past, it is heard that the proposed treaty will be based on equality and reciprocity. It is heard that they have reached an agreement on its broad principles, and only some details remain to be discussed.

[Another dispatch, 15th] The Sino-Siamese negotiations, originally scheduled to continue today to resolve the Bangkok massacre of overseas Chinese, were postponed to tomorrow afternoon due to the indisposition of Siamese Interior Minister Banyakan. Negotiations to improve diplomatic relations between the two countries will be held separately. Our three representatives held talks with Siamese Police Chief Plaramin Indra for half an hour regarding the massacre. Mr. Pho expressed his regret for the unfortunate event and hoped that the peoples of China and Siam, who have a long-standing friendship, could live and work together in Siam in the future. It is learned that our delegation will propose the following conditions as the basis for resolving the atrocity: (1) Investigate the responsibility for the incident and punish the perpetrators. (2) Compensate our overseas Chinese for all losses. And (3) Guarantee that the same incident will not happen in the future.

### Bizarre Gunshot Wound Case in the Chongqing Xinhua Daily Office; Soldier Qin Yingjun Shot

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] At 12:30 PM on the 17th, Qin Yingjun, a major general staff officer from the former Kunming Garrison Headquarters and a native of Ziyang, Shandong, was talking with Zhang Ruxin, the business director of Xinhua Daily, in the business department. He then flipped through newspapers there. Suddenly, a gunshot was heard, and Qin immediately fell to the ground, and a Browning pistol was found on the ground. According to Zhang Ruxin, Qin committed suicide. He was shot in the left waist, and his injuries were serious, so he was escorted to the Municipal Hospital by the Fourth Police Sub-bureau for treatment. The cause of his injury, as well as the gun and the shell casing, are under investigation. According to Yin Jun of the Municipal Hospital, when Qin arrived at the hospital, he asked him why he was injured. Qin only said, "It's a long story, please give me a painkiller." Then, he fell into a coma.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Qin Yingjun, who was shot in the Xinhua Daily business department on the 17th, has been recovering well since being sent to the Municipal Hospital for treatment, and the bullet in his abdomen has been removed.

### Holding Domestic and Foreign Exchange Services: Postal, Telegraph, and Transportation Departments Actively Preparing for Resumption

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] Exchange services between the nine northeastern provinces and the mainland will soon begin. The Economic Commission here will establish a special committee of seven members to manage this matter. The committee will be located in Changchun and, when necessary, will establish branches in major cities such as Shenyang, Harbin, and Dalian. All exchanges from the nine northeastern provinces of circulating currency to legal tender, or from the mainland of legal tender to circulating currency, must first apply to the committee for approval. However, households remitting less than 5,000 yuan in circulating currency or its equivalent in legal tender per month do not need to apply. This exchange will be operated by the Central Bank and its entrusted banks; no other banks are allowed to operate it. The exchange rate will be posted daily by the Central Bank. Furthermore, since the banks here began exchanging legal tender at a rate of 13 to 1, very few people have come to exchange. This may indicate that there is not much legal tender flowing into this area.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 18th] Northeastern postal, telegraph, and transportation services are actively preparing for resumption. Although postal and telegraph functions in various places have been suspended for a long time, most employees are still holding fast to their posts, quietly awaiting central government takeover. Currently, transportation ministry telecommunications officials are studying pricing issues, and once these are settled, operations can begin. Furthermore, the takeover of railway transportation outside of the China Changchun Railway is still in the preparation stage, and the entire takeover may take a month.

### Serious Disaster Situation in Chao-Shan and Henan: Relief Administration Publishes Investigation Report

[Central News Agency, This City Report] In October of last year, the United Nations Relief Administration dispatched inspectors Johnson, Moore, and Parnell to the Chao-Shan and Henan areas to inspect the disaster situation after being ravaged by the enemy's cavalry and to investigate the relief materials urgently needed in these areas. Johnson and others completed a detailed investigation of the disaster conditions in the aforementioned areas last month and have prepared a report for submission to the Administration, detailing the damage, disaster situation, and relief and reconstruction measures. Here is an excerpt of the original text:

The inspector to the Chao-Shan area was Johnson. Johnson departed from Guangdong on October 18th of last year and spent more than two weeks investigating. His report is 25 pages long. According to his report: "The total population of Chao-Shan (including Chaozhou and Shantou) in 1939 was 4,750,000. Since 1939, the population has greatly decreased. However, it is currently not easy to investigate the total population of the entire area. The reasons for the population decrease are as follows: entering the mainland, dying in air raids, Japanese atrocities, hurricanes, nutritional deficiencies, and diseases, and being plundered by the Japanese military. During the investigation, trial statistics of population changes and their causes were conducted in several places. The results showed that Shantou had 220,000 people before its fall (1939), and 150,000 people at the time of the investigation (November 1945). The current population of Shantou is 60,000 less than before its fall. Among them, 25,000 died from famine and disease, 5,000 were killed or plundered by the Japanese army, 1,000 died from air raids, and the remaining 29,000 could not be traced, presumably dying of starvation during their exile."

The report also stated: "The Chao-Shan area is currently in a difficult situation. The reasons for this are: (1) famine and Japanese looting; (2) naval blockade, no foreign rice coming in, and trade stagnation; (3) complete stagnation of the two major industries (weaving and fishing); (4) agricultural decline, loss of production, and lack of fertilizer; (5) financial chaos and cessation of overseas remittances; (6) the current political situation. Regarding relief, the area urgently needs rice, which is listed as the first item to be relieved. Clothing is second, followed by medicine and treatment. Housing is next, and finally, displaced people."

Regarding reconstruction issues, Johnson also detailed them: "It is found that there are a total of 400,000 people engaged in weaving in the Chao-Shan area. The raw materials come from overseas, and the finished products are exported to the United States and other places. When the war broke out, foreign transportation was interrupted, and this industry plummeted, losing all its capital. People in the industry are now requesting assistance with funds to restore their business, restore foreign shipping routes, and adjust foreign exchange. In addition, there are other handicrafts such as bamboo work and pottery. It is also found that the most important product of the Chao-Shan area is fishing. Because most of the fishing boats were lost, their situation is extremely difficult, but the assistance they need may be the easiest to give. What they need is wood for shipbuilding, tung oil and hemp for making steel cables, as well as iron, nails, and tools. Also, the area does not produce much rice, only enough to supply half of the people's food. During the war, farmers fled, and foreign raw materials were no longer transported in, resulting in even less production. What farmers urgently need now is artificial raw materials and soybean cake, with soybean cake being particularly welcome. The next is the replenishment of plowing cattle and farm tools, and the construction of embankments to prevent flooding is also an urgent task. All these requests have been translated and sent to the Guangzhou regional office of the Administration for verification. The buildings and public utilities that have been destroyed must wait until loans are obtained and cement and other materials are imported before reconstruction can begin. Detailed needs are currently being compiled. Regarding transportation, the importance of foreign shipping and inland river transportation is self-evident. A list of various ships that have been destroyed is also being compiled. There was originally a railway from Shantou to Chao'an, but the rails no longer exist, and the roadbed has become a car road."

Moore and Parnell, representing the United Nations, went to Henan Province, riding horses, taking sedan chairs, and traveling in slow-moving cars for more than 40,000 miles to investigate the war disaster situation in the province. According to their estimates, about two million people in Henan Province, accounting for one-sixth of the province's population, are now in a dire situation of becoming starving corpses and are in urgent need of relief. Moreover, many wear summer clothes in the cold winter, and these unfortunate people have no place to shelter from the cold. Due to the lack of food, clothing, and housing, infectious diseases are rampant throughout Henan Province. Western Henan has been through repeated wars and has been occupied by the enemy, so its situation is the worst. More than 200,000 poor people have taken refuge in other places, and recently, when they returned, they saw that their houses had either been burned or looted, and all their furniture had been destroyed by the Japanese. According to the two representatives: "Everywhere we went, we heard people say that from the time of Japan's defeat to the time we came to inspect in November, 80 to 90 percent of the people in western Henan were sick." In the worst-hit areas, the dead accounted for between 10 and 15 percent of the total population. The representatives of the United Nations Relief Administration also stated: "The most important need is agricultural reconstruction. The lack of livestock is the most serious single problem." Those who fled their homes to avoid the Japanese army's invasion of Henan Province in 1945, when they attempted to attack Xi'an, all said in unison: "There was no harvest of wheat last year, and no wheat was planted for the next crop." This kind of complaint is everywhere in western Henan. Because when the Japanese army invaded last year, the people of Henan did not have time to plant wheat and fled hastily, so there was no harvest when they returned home. The representatives of the United Nations Relief Administration also stated that the first township authorities initiated a self-help method that did not require outside assistance. Other counties also adopted it and achieved results. They said: "This method is to use the plowing cattle of neighboring areas that were not affected by the war and still have livestock to cultivate the fields in the recovered areas. This is purely based on the simple philosophy of those who have helping those who do not. More than 3,000 cattle are distributed in one county. On average, they work for about 20 days. The cattle owners come to work with their cattle and provide fodder. As for the food for the people, it is provided by the local relief committee. However, this system cannot be applied during the busy farming season in June, because it is necessary to harvest and thresh wheat, and planting must be done within a month."

Farmers need steel to make farming tools. It is believed that in some areas, with the availability of loans, it will be easier to equip tractors and other machinery. However, in completely destroyed areas, direct relief is needed. Other equipment needed includes new looms, which is a work-relief plan to replace the more than 100,000 handlooms destroyed by the Japanese army. In addition to the war, Henan Province also has the Yellow River disaster area, which started in 1932 when the levees were breached to stop the Japanese army's advance. This is a large-scale relief and reconstruction problem in Henan Province. It is estimated that the area flooded during the flood originally had a population of five million people. However, there are no accurate statistics on the number of refugees in the Yellow River disaster area. Roughly estimated, there are currently about two million people in the Yellow River disaster area, at least one million of whom are starving. The reconstruction plan for this area includes returning the Yellow River to its original course and building dikes along the river to reduce the flooded area and prevent good farmland from continuing to be flooded. The most severely affected areas of Henan Province have many Catholic churches. According to the priests, people are eating whatever they can find due to extreme famine, so food is the most important relief item needed, but relief in the form of clothing and medicine is also important.

### British Foreign Secretary Announces Abandonment of African Mandate Territories, Placing Them Under Trusteeship System

[Reuters, London, 18th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin announced yesterday at the United Nations General Assembly that three British-mandated territories in Africa, namely Tanganyika, Upper Cameroon, and Togoland, would be placed under the trusteeship system. Transjordan will become an independent state. Any step taken by any country so far in the London Assembly is the most important and far-reaching. Following this, the Commissioner for South Africa explained last night that South West Africa, the former German colony currently under mandate to the Union of South Africa, must have its future decided after consulting the people of the area. Preliminary consultations have begun on the transfer of the three British-mandated territories in Africa to the Trusteeship Council. It is heard that the issue of Transjordan's full independence will be discussed when Emir Abdullah visits London next month. Thus, the only land still under direct British mandate is Palestine. According to Bevin's announcement, it is now necessary to wait for the results of the British-American investigation committee on Palestine before making any suggestions on the Holy Land. Bevin's words have attracted attention from all parties. It is generally believed that Transjordan and Palestine may unite and solve the Palestinian issue by means of division. Last night's opinions seemed to believe that Transjordan's independence would not make the division of the Palestinian issue more difficult to resolve. According to our correspondent, Jin Shu: There are several key points to consider in giving Transjordan independence. For example, Transjordan occupies a special position in the Middle East. Its army is crucial to ensuring its own security. Therefore, Transjordan's independence is closely linked to the future of its army. Therefore, when Abdullah comes to London, he may raise issues such as forming a joint defense force with Iraq. Note: Tanganyika was formerly German East Africa, later divided by Britain and Belgium, and transferred to British mandate in 1921. It has more than five million indigenous people and 16,000 Europeans, managed by a governor with two councils, executive and legislative. Cameroon is between Nigeria and French Equatorial Africa. It was seized from the Germans in 1916 and divided by Britain and France three years later. It was transferred to British mandate in 1922 and has a population of less than one million, jointly managed by the Governor of Nigeria. Togoland is between the Gold Coast colony and French Dahomey. In August 1914, the Germans surrendered unconditionally. The First World War was divided by Britain and France. The British-mandated area has a population of less than 500,000, jointly managed by the Governor of the Gold Coast.

Palestine Not on the List of Abandonment

[United Press, London, 17th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin announced at the United Nations General Assembly today that Britain had decided to transfer three mandate territories in Africa to the United Nations for trusteeship, and Transjordan would eventually be granted independence. The whole audience applauded unanimously. However, most representatives of various countries had heard about it beforehand, so they were not surprised. However, Palestine is not on the list of British-mandated territories to be abandoned, apparently because the British-American investigation committee is inspecting the situation of Arabs and Jews in Palestine. Any announcement at this time would hinder the work of the committee. Palestine did not send representatives to the United Nations General Assembly, so the representatives of the countries belonging to the Arab League expressed great concern about this and morally fully supported it. The demand of the Palestinian Arabs is that Palestine must become an independent Arab state, but the representatives also believe that the committee's investigation report should not be preconceived, so they will not decide on the final attitude until the report is published. According to Arab sources here: It is regrettable that the United States has repeatedly expressed sympathy for the Jews, but the conclusion of the committee may completely satisfy the Arabs. In any case, the Palestinian issue will not cause sharp conflicts during this session. If the committee's report is contrary to Arab opinions, the Arab League will convene a plenary session to decide on Arab policy and strategy.

[United Press, London, 17th] Egyptian Foreign Minister Balinwi told United Press reporters today: According to the opinions of Arab nations, the British White Paper previously published has recognized Palestine as an Arab country, so there is no need to establish a British-American investigation committee for Palestine.

New Guinea: Australia Also Announces Abandonment

[United Press, London, 18th] According to Melbourne Radio, Australian Prime Minister Chifley has announced that Australia will hand over the mandate territory of New Guinea to the United Nations for trusteeship.

[Reuters, Canberra, 18th] Australian Prime Minister Chifley declared today that Australia is prepared to hand over New Guinea and the part of Nauru Island under Australian mandate to international trusteeship, because Australia has not dared to forget the obligations imposed by the United Nations Charter on member states in managing non-self-governing territories. The British and New Zealand governments, which jointly mandate Nauru, have agreed to Australia's decision. Note: Nauru Island and eastern New Guinea were formerly German colonies. After World War I, they were handed over to Australian mandate. Western New Guinea is a Dutch colony.

### Iran Consults the General Assembly on Procedures for Accusing the Soviet Union

[United Press, London, 18th] The Iranian issue is still the biggest obstacle for the United Nations. If it is submitted to the Security Council for discussion, the unity of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union will be affected. If it is left unresolved, it will not be enough to calm Iran's anger and will damage the credibility of the entire Council. If the result of the vote is unfavorable to Iran, the smaller countries will lose faith in the United Nations.

[United Press, London, 18th] The chief representative of Iran to the United Nations General Assembly, 台, discussed the procedures for Iran's accusation against the Soviet Union with the Secretary-General of the General Assembly today.

[Our Newspaper Report] According to London Radio on the 18th: The Iranian government's determination to submit the Iranian-Soviet dispute in Azerbaijan Province to the United Nations General Assembly has raised major procedural issues. This issue arose from the joint occupation of Iran by American, British, and Soviet troops. After the Soviet Union rejected the recommendation of the Tripartite Committee to investigate the situation in northern Iran, the British government "strongly advised" Iran not to submit the case to the United Nations General Assembly for adjudication. Later, the British government changed its policy and informed the Iranian government, "You are free to submit it to the United Nations General Assembly." The Iranian delegation has not yet decided whether to submit the case to the General Assembly or the Security Council, but it seems to be "inclining towards" the General Assembly. If submitted to the General Assembly, it may be handed over to the Political and Security Committee. If the case is handed over to the Security Council, there are signs that the debate will be postponed, because the Soviet Union can simultaneously raise other troublesome issues, such as the withdrawal of British troops from Greece, Indonesia, and other places.

### U.S. Congressional Opinion

Trusteeship of Pacific Islands to be Finally Decided by Congress

[United Press, Washington, 17th] President Truman announced a few days ago that the Pacific islands acquired by the United States from Japan would be transferred to the United Nations for trusteeship, but those with strategic value would still be kept solely by the United States. The congressional side expressed its opinion today, believing that Congress should make the final decision on which islands should be kept by the United States. Democratic Senator George and Republican Senator 　Kaisen said: They hope that the United States will not hastily determine this matter before Congress discusses it. This matter must first be approved by Congress before a decision is made. Those islands that need to be retained for strategic reasons should be handled according to the recommendations of the Army and Navy. For the sake of future security, these islands must be completely retained by the United States. The proposal to place all Pacific islands under trusteeship, with the United States as the sole trustee, cannot be agreed to.

### U.S., Britain, and Soviet Union Reach Agreement to Dispose of German Ships

[United Press, Berlin, 18th] According to reliable sources here today, the naval committee of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union has reached an agreement on the disposal of German warships, merchant ships, and other ship equipment. The contents of the agreement will be published simultaneously in Washington, Moscow, and London. It is reported that except for a few ships that will be used by the United States for testing, the other warships are not needed by various countries due to differences in structure and gun caliber.

### Hollywood Producers Compete to Film Atomic Bomb Movies; MGM is Already Filming

[United Press, Hollywood, 17th] Some Hollywood film producers have encountered a problem. That is, how to link the issue of sex with the atomic bomb. Now there are four film companies competing to see who can be the first to complete a film about the atomic bomb and show it everywhere. According to Hollywood conventions, they all want to add some romance to the realism. Sam Marx is producing this film for MGM, believing that he has solved the problem. His film is called "The Beginning or the End," and the content is a humane story that depicts the daily life of atomic bomb workers and how tense it is. He is not allowed to talk to others about his work. There are thousands of laws for seven people to gather together, not only prohibiting drinking, but even those who play cards must be punished. Marx said: "People who work in atomic bomb factories, few people can understand what a tense matter their children are. They never know why they move frequently, or what their husbands do, or where they will move next time. Many marriages have therefore broken down. Now we see very clearly that the man lost the woman, and the world got the atomic bomb, so the man got the woman again." Marx traveled back from Washington and Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and learned about the significance of the atomic bomb from President Truman and other matters related to the atomic bomb program. Marx said: "The invention of the atomic bomb may not have been in 1945, but in 2045. I hope that Americans who watch this film will get some impression of the importance of the atomic bomb."

### United Nations Security Council Holds First Meeting: Gu Weijun Emphasizes Importance of the Council

[United Press, London, 17th] The United Nations organization's eleven representatives held their first meeting this afternoon, marking the true existence of the powerful Security Council. This historic meeting took place in London's renowned Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament. In these difficult times, the great task of maintaining world peace will rest on the shoulders of the representatives. The five permanent members of the Security Council—the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and China—all have the right to veto any action of the Council. In addition, it includes non-permanent members Australia, Brazil, Egypt, the Netherlands, Mexico, and Poland. The Security Council's current priorities are: (1) the election of the Secretary-General of the United Nations organization; (2) the first convocation of the Military Staff Committee meeting; and (3) discussing ways for member states to utilize the military forces of the Security Council. Australian Foreign Minister Makin delivered the opening address, stating, "I declare the Security Council officially established and in session." The Polish representative then presented to the Council the report of the preparatory committee of the Council. The United States chief representative Stettinius stated: The success of the Security Council depends on how member states fulfill their special responsibilities, especially the responsibility of coordination, before the Council can take effective action. This clearly refers to the veto power of the five powers. The Chinese chief representative Gu Weijun stated: This meeting is an event of great significance to peace-loving people in the world. China deeply loves peace but does not submit to others. The primary responsibility of the United Nations organization is to maintain peace and security, and China is immensely pleased with the establishment of this major organ of the United Nations. Bevin, after praising the United Nations organization and the Security Council as "a great success," emphasized the importance of the International Secretariat. He believes that the money spent on the United Nations organization to make it effective is insignificant compared to the vast expense of war. He continued: The current great gathering of nations is the realization of the hope held during the darkest days of the war, its purpose being to create a world organization so that mankind can live in freedom and peace without fear. The responsibility of the United Nations organization is to regard war as illegal and to take immediate action if there are any signs. It is the responsibility of the Security Council to carefully plan to prevent any aggressor from launching another war. We also welcome the Atomic Energy Commission, which controls scientific inventions. According to information from the Dutch delegation here, to date, the Chairman of the unrecognized Republic of Indonesia, Sjahrir, has not yet appealed to the United Nations organization on behalf of the government of the Republic. A member of the Dutch delegation told the United Press that although such news has been circulating from the Indonesian side, no such request has been received to date. Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Masaryk, following Bevin's speech, suggested that the world's arms industry should be controlled by the United Nations organization and urged the establishment of regional centers of the United Nations organization to deal with issues such as health and agriculture. Masaryk also suggested that trade unions should be able to send representatives to the United Nations organization, especially the Economic and Social Council, so that organized labor in the world can have a voice in the United Nations organization. Currently, the World Federation of Trade Unions, with the support of the Soviet Union, is demanding this right to speak.

### Churchill Invited to Visit the United States

[United Press, Miami, 17th] Former British Prime Minister Churchill, at the age of 71, made a long journey, crossing the Atlantic from Britain to New York, and then from New York to southern Florida, a total of 4,500 miles. Today, after examination by cardiologist Dr. Harris, it was announced that Churchill's health is good and has not been affected by the long journey. People generally expected Churchill to attend the opening ceremony of the Hialeah Racetrack, but it is understood that Churchill does not intend to appear in public immediately, so this hope has now vanished. Before dinner yesterday, Churchill took a leisurely drive with his host, Colonel Clark, around the palm-lined canals and Miami Beach for about an hour. He appeared very relaxed and in high spirits.

### Chilean Literary Figure Wins Nobel Prize

[United Press, Paris, 17th] The Chilean literary figure, Mistral, has won the Nobel Prize in Literature. The Director of Cultural Affairs of the French Foreign Ministry, Raoul, hosted a banquet today to welcome him.

### Speech by Soviet Representative to the UN General Assembly, Gromyko

[Reuters, London, 18th] The acting head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations organization, Gromyko, addressed the General Assembly meeting this morning, stating in brief: The first session of the United Nations organization's General Assembly is an important stage in the process of freedom-loving nations striving for peace and security. It is also the inevitable development of the ideas expressed in the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Declaration at the Moscow Conference in October 1943. The declaration stated that an international organization must be established to ensure peace and security.

Gromyko continued: All countries, large and small, are concerned with obtaining a stable peace and preventing the recurrence of aggression. Now, an organization responsible for maintaining peace has been established, and if aggressors attempt to endanger peace and freedom, the Security Council can stop them. The most important principle of the Charter has therefore been implemented.

The Soviet delegation hopes that the activities of the Security Council will be aimed at realizing the objectives of the United Nations organization and will be effective from the beginning. It is also hoped that the General Assembly will establish an Atomic Energy Commission, as proposed at the last Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. However, as soon as the organization is established, it is heard from some quarters that the Charter is outdated and needs to be revised. All those who wish to establish a strong organization to ensure security must strongly refute these arguments, as they are dangerous and can have serious consequences.

For the activities of the various organizations of the United Nations to be fruitful, compliance with the Charter is a necessary condition, and the United Nations organization must be different from the League of Nations. If the methods used by the League of Nations are repeated, it will be harmful to the United Nations organization. Some provisions in the Charter have not yet been implemented, especially the one concerning non-self-governing territories.

The trusteeship system is a tool intended to accelerate the granting of independence to these peoples. Therefore, the prompt implementation of the trusteeship system is one of the most important obligations of member states. The preparatory committee has made considerable progress and has already passed a special resolution requesting that certain member states of the United Nations organization convert one of these types of territories into a trust territory.

Gromyko also stated: The United Nations organization was created as a result of the bloody battle against fascism. Now, German fascism and Japanese militarism have been defeated, and the two sources of aggression that have alarmed the world for many years and plunged humanity into the most brutal war have been eliminated. However, it would be a mistake to believe that this military victory means that there is no need to continue efforts to completely eliminate the remnants of fascism. The struggle to eliminate the remnants of fascism is inseparable from the work of the organization.

Gromyko concluded: "Please allow me to express the hope for the success of the conference's work. The Soviet delegation will do its best to contribute to the successful completion of the conference."

### MacArthur Arrests More Japanese War Criminals: Total of 110, Including Lianjie Guji: Headquarters Allows Japanese to Choose Their Own Political Parties and Leaders

[United Press, Tokyo, 18th] MacArthur's headquarters today ordered the Japanese government to arrest 110 more war suspects, including seven generals and many administrators from various parts of Asia. Former head of the general headquarters, Kazuo Washi, is listed first. The second is former Hong Kong Governor, Lieutenant General Guji Kangjie; former commander of the Japanese army on Davao Island in the Philippines, Lieutenant General Kawatani; former commander of the 25th Army, Lieutenant General Sakai; former commander of the 6th Division, Lieutenant General Tani; former commander of the 38th Division, Lieutenant General Kakezu; former commander of the 3rd Wartime Transportation Unit in Singapore, Major General Watanabe; and captain of the prisoner ship "Tachibana" Maru, Yasuda. More than 70 of the new suspects are responsible for prisoner camps, including supervisors of the famous Cabanatuan prisoner camp in the Philippines and the prisoner camp in Shenyang.

[U.S. News Service, Tokyo, 17th] Crane of the "New York Times" reported from Tokyo that after "a rather neat about-face," the Communist Party of Japan has proposed depriving the Emperor of his political power but retaining him as a "formal leader" pending a nationwide vote to decide his future. This clever political action followed the return of Japanese Communist leader Susumu Okano. Okano, who changed his name several times during 16 years of exile, had recently resided in Yan'an, the Communist Party's stronghold, and for the past two years, his consistent position had been to abolish the Emperor. However, Okano has now realized the truth. Upon returning to the country, he immediately urged the Communist Party of Japan to change its course because following the original path was tantamount to political suicide. No matter how well the Japanese can accept the ideas of liberalism, they still regard the Emperor as the head of state. Therefore, the Communist Party's demand to abolish the Emperor has not been warmly welcomed. However, after the Communist Party changed its policy, the situation has obviously changed. The Communist Party had discussed with the Socialist Party of Japan to form a "People's Front," and now they have some hope. At least 29 leaders of the left wing of the Social Democratic Party of Japan have agreed to join this "People's Front." The Communist Party of Japan has greatly increased its strength through this transformation. To counter this, 14 right-wing political parties in Japan have announced that they will form a united front. However, their strength is obviously not comparable to the "People's Front" that is about to be established.

Japanese Police Allowed to Carry Handguns

[United Press, Tokyo, 18th] It was announced today that MacArthur's headquarters has allowed the Japanese government to equip Japanese police with handguns. MacArthur's instructions stated that the Japanese side's prohibition of police carrying weapons was a misunderstanding of MacArthur's disarmament instructions. Previous instructions had never prohibited the police from carrying handguns. "MacArthur's headquarters has never had this intention." The Japanese side stated that the police's lack of weapons would hinder the maintenance of order and the suppression of crime. However, although the police may carry handguns when performing their duties, the total number of handguns issued must not exceed the number of police personnel approved by MacArthur's headquarters, and each handgun may be loaded with 100 rounds of ammunition. All other military supplies and excess handguns must be in accordance with the approved strength of the Japanese police. According to MacArthur, the total number of Japanese police officers approved is 93,935.

### Australia and New Zealand Submit List of War Criminals, Including Hirohito

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch] The governments of Australia and New Zealand have submitted a list of war criminals, including Emperor Hirohito, which has caused considerable difficulty for the Allied headquarters. The headquarters' intention is not to include the Emperor in the list of war criminals. The list submitted by the United Kingdom did not include the Emperor as a war criminal.

### Japan to Organize Royalist Party

[United Press, Tokyo, 18th] According to the Jiji News Agency, Japan will soon organize a royalist party to teach the people about the Emperor system. It will be supported by secondary figures in the business community. The party will also propose moving the imperial palace to the ancient city of Kyoto, so that the Emperor will be in a detached position from politics.

[United Press, Tokyo, 18th] Kyodo News Agency reported: Constitution Research Committee member Shiratsuki presented a chapter on the constitution to Emperor Hirohito today, advocating the establishment of a regency in accordance with the imperial palace laws.

### Eisenhower Tells Senate that Reducing U.S. Troops in the Pacific Will Weaken Control

[United Press, Washington, 17th] Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower conveyed MacArthur's report to the Senate Military Committee today, stating that if the U.S. troops stationed in the Pacific are reduced to less than 400,000 by July 1, the military control over Japan and South Korea will be "weakened to a dangerous level." The troops stationed in the Pacific will be reduced to 375,000 workers by July 1, which is 25,000 workers less than MacArthur needs. How should this be remedied? Eisenhower replied: What I adjusted was the total number of air forces, while what MacArthur said included all troops stationed in Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, the Mariana Islands, and Hawaii.

### Vyshinsky's Whereabouts Still Unclear: Soviet Representative Attends General Assembly: French Foreign Minister Arrives in London from Paris: Drafting of Peace Treaty May Begin Immediately

[This Newspaper] London, 18th, midnight broadcast: The United Nations General Assembly convened an extraordinary meeting at nine o'clock this morning. Soviet Chief Representative and Deputy Commissioner of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs Vyshinsky arrived here by plane this afternoon to attend the meeting. Also arriving with Vyshinsky was a French representative. Soviet Representative Gromyko delivered a speech on behalf of Vyshinsky at the General Assembly today, which was quite concise and pertinent.

[Reuters, London, 18th] Gromyko delivered the speech this morning on behalf of Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky. It is expected that Vyshinsky will not be able to arrive in London today. At the same time, French Foreign Minister Bidault and Undersecretary Thormeville are scheduled to return here from Paris today, and the deputy foreign ministers of the four countries concerned with drafting the peace treaty with European enemies may begin work immediately. Before Vyshinsky arrives in London, it is difficult to say whether they can go further in planning to start work. However, since the French government has now accepted the agreements recently negotiated in Moscow, there are no more obstacles to the four deputy ministers proceeding with their work.

[Reuters, London, 18th] The whereabouts of Soviet Chief Representative to the United Nations organization, Vyshinsky, are still unknown. As it stands, Vyshinsky does not seem to have left Moscow yet. The most recent expectation is that he will arrive here on Saturday. According to reports, Vyshinsky is the Deputy Commissioner of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union. His position in the General Assembly is temporarily filled by Soviet Ambassador to the United States Gromyko. To date, the Iranian issue and the territorial demands on Turkey are still outside the debate of the General Assembly. The Executive Secretary of the United Nations organization, Jebb, has not yet received a request from the Iranian delegation to raise the Azerbaijan issue in the General Assembly or the Security Council.

### Chinese Troops Withdrawing from Vietnam: Have Already Withdrawn from Hue and Tourane

[United Press, Washington, 17th] A diplomatic source told the United Press today that the French Governor-General of Vietnam, Admiral D'Argenlieu, reported to Paris that Chinese troops have withdrawn from the cities of Hue and Tourane in Annam Province. He said: This is the first sign of the withdrawal of the Chinese Liberation Army from Vietnam. According to reliable sources: U.S. Commander in China Theater, Lieutenant General Wedemeyer, recently urged Chairman Chiang to order the Chinese generals stationed in Vietnam to begin withdrawing troops. The French, seeing that most of the Chinese soldiers are from Yunnan, are quite worried that they will be unwilling to withdraw.

### Sound Wave Gun: Using Sound Waves to Kill: The United States is Investigating

[United Press, Maryland, 18th] American Army ballistics experts announced today that the German army experimented with a new weapon before the end of the war, called the sound wave gun, which can kill people in 30 to 40 seconds using sound waves. After the war, Germany told American experts that they did not believe the weapon could succeed, but American officers said that it was possible and should be investigated further.

### The United States Compiles Atomic Fleet: Testing the Power of Atomic Bombs

[United Press, Tulsa, USA, 18th] Rear Admiral Burke announced today: Testing the power of atomic bombs on warships this spring is estimated to cost 100 million yuan. It is expected that the results of this test will determine the future scale of the world's naval equipment test. The scale will be similar to the capture of Okinawa. According to scientists' speculation: if an atomic bomb explodes one and a half miles below the surface of the sea, it can exert the highest power.

[United Press, Honolulu, 18th] Workers heard today that a small team of "atomic fleet" was placed inside Pearl Harbor to test the power of atomic bombs. The Naval Staff did not confirm this news, but did not deny it. According to reliable sources: the naval authorities recently dragged many long-fought residual destroyers into Pearl Harbor for testing. The testing period may be this spring. At that time, battleships, cruisers and other ships will also gather to form an "atomic fleet."

Wuxi: Uncoordinated Coupling of Freight Cars: At 6:48 yesterday morning, a train of freight cars numbered 5th, originating from Shanghai, carrying over twenty cars, one of which carried military supplies weighing fifteen tons and three of which held a company of soldiers from the Guard Brigade under the command of the Liaison, headed by Company Commander Zhu Jie. The military supplies were to be unloaded here and at 7:30, the engine pulled the first ten cars forward to a platform, detaching car number 102 containing military supplies and shunting it into another rail for unloading. It was then returned to the original track to couple with the rest of the cars, but the engine was going too fast, and when the two cars collided, the hooks did not catch and the cars behind were jolted, causing them to roll backwards for dozens of feet. Ordnance was thrown from the cars, fortunately without exploding. Zheng Xianchi, the company aide, as well as soldiers Lu Dingyuan and Ye Teyu, who were standing near the door of the last car, were jolted and fell off into the rail. Lu Dingyuan had his right hand and foot run over, while Ye Teyu and Zheng Xianchi suffered injuries to the hand and ear. They were taken to hospital.

Panorama of the Consultative Conference

### The First Milestone in the History of Peaceful Nation Building: The Political Consultative Conference in Pictures

— From Our Newspaper Archives

The "New York Times" spoke with extreme sincerity in its editorial on the 7th, pointing out the main point: that everyone in our country has clearly recognized that unity and peace are the foundation for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and they are willing to build this foundation on the Political Consultative Conference, which began on the 10th. On the eve of the convening of the Consultative Conference, we strongly harbored an overwhelming wish - a wish placed on the meeting of the Three-Person Committee composed of Generals Ma, Zhang, and Zhou. This meeting began at 10:00 AM on the 7th in Yi Garden. After the talks, the two representatives of the government and the Communist Party (Zhang Qun and Zhou Enlai) took a photo of special value with General Marshall. (See Picture 3) General Marshall, in this case, served as the chairman of the committee and completed the great and arduous task of mediator.

The achievements of the Three-Person Committee were great, laying the initial foundation for stopping military conflicts on the one hand, and solving the prerequisite problem of restoring national transportation on the other.

At the same time, on the same day that the Marshall-Zhang Qun-Zhou Enlai Three-Person Committee was meeting, an informal meeting of the Consultative Conference was also held under the chairmanship of Chairman Chiang, which included 38 representatives from nine parties and several non-party members. The agenda and voting methods of the first plenary session of the Consultative Conference, which was scheduled to open on the 10th, were discussed, and the meeting proceeded and ended in an extremely harmonious atmosphere. The seven representatives of the Communist Party were: Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Lu Dingyi, Ye Jianying, Deng Yingchao, Wu Yuzhang, and Wang Ruofei. A photo of them together is published here (see Picture 4). What is most interesting is that Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao are a loving couple, accounting for two-sevenths of all the representatives, which is truly rare.

On the 8th, the Democratic National Construction Association hosted the representatives of the Consultative Conference, and Peng Yihu delivered a speech, the enthusiastic mood of which can be seen in Picture 5.

The historically significant Consultative Conference was finally born on the 10th. This sweet baby was born after months of suffering and contention, so when its birthday arrived, all the military and civilians felt joyful. From the second picture, we see the solemnity and harmony of the opening ceremony in the auditorium of the National Government. The first picture gives us a hint of the orderliness and enthusiasm with which representatives from all parties, factions, and non-party members attended the meeting on time. Finally, the corner of the fifth picture shows the posture of Zeng Qi, the representative of the Youth Party, delivering a speech.

### Vice Minister Lin Reports to the Consultative Conference on Military Reorganization Measures

The full text of the report on military reorganization measures made by Lin Wei, Vice Minister of Military Affairs, when he attended the Political Consultative Conference on the 16th, is divided into two stages: The first stage described the military reorganization situation last year, which has already been seen on the first page of this newspaper on the 17th. According to a letter from the Central News Agency, "In the article on military reorganization measures reported by Vice Minister Lin Wei, which was issued by our agency yesterday, there are some errors in the numbers. The corrections are as follows: 'First, the reason for the military reorganization... the total number of troops is 49 armies, 128 divisions,' '128 divisions' should be changed to '182 divisions,'... expanding to 124 armies, 354 divisions, 31 brigades, 112 regiments, and 15 battalions,' omitting '112 regiments.'... This expansion rate is only about two times,' 'two times' should be changed to 'one time.'" The second stage clarifies this year's military reorganization plan, which is moved and published here from Section (4). Readers are requested to pay attention. (Editor)

Any unit that has completed the reorganization in accordance with the principles of reorganization can begin to receive the new allowance; troops that have not been reorganized in accordance with the principles will still receive the old allowance. For example, a unit that completes reorganization first will enjoy the new allowance first. As of the end of the 34th year [1945], the situation of troop reorganization is as follows: (1) At the end of the 33rd year [1944], there were 124 armies, 354 divisions, 31 brigades, 112 regiments, and 15 battalions. (2) Reduced in the 36th year [1947] 111 divisions, 21 brigades, 83 regiments, and 10 battalions.

(3) 87 armies, 235 divisions, 8 brigades, 35 regiments, and 5 battalions have been reorganized. (4) Those that have not been reorganized include 4 armies and 18 divisions, mostly in Xinjiang, where it is not easy to implement. (5) There are currently 89 infantry armies, 2 cavalry armies, and 253 divisions. (Including the newly added Youth Army 3 armies, 8 divisions and newly reorganized 2 divisions) Regarding the replenishment aspect, at the beginning of the plan, it was completely based on the counter-offensive plan, replenishing the combat power of the main counter-offensive forces, measuring the domestic ordnance production and foreign material assistance situation, so the troops under the jurisdiction of the Army Headquarters (ie, Alpha troops) and the southwest area troops were first replenished. The replenishment situation is as follows: (1) It is planned to equip 12 armies and 36 divisions with American equipment, and 10 armies and 31 division regiments with national equipment. By the end of the 34th year [1945], American equipment completed 80% of light weapons and 55% of heavy weapons. National equipment completed the equipment of 10 armies and 31 divisions, and other reorganized troops also have plans to gradually replenish. (2) Improving the lives of officers and soldiers. During the War of Resistance last year, prices rose sharply, and both production and transportation were extremely difficult. The lives of officers and soldiers across the country were in a very difficult state. The headquarters exhausted the central government's financial resources to improve the two major aspects of life's difficulties, namely, raising treatment and supplementing food. Regarding the increase in the treatment of officers and soldiers, from April to November of the 34th year [1945], there have been three adjustments, with officers' salaries increasing by 6 to 7 times and soldiers increasing by about 30 times. However, due to the limitations of national financial and material resources and the excessive increase in prices, it has not been possible to achieve the ideal stage. Secondly, supplementing food, that is, quantitatively issuing real goods, is an extremely urgent need to increase the nutrition of soldiers and officers. The headquarters made the greatest determination to achieve this goal. Although there is a standard for non-staple food expenses, those with excessively high prices in various places are also given an appropriate increase. Since the implementation, the nutrition of soldiers has improved a lot, but the situation in various places and transportation relations have not been fully implemented, which is a pity. (3) Adjusting the military organization, the size of military organizations and military schools is 4,300 units, 1,504 of which have been cut, and there are currently about 2,796, about 40% of which have been cut. There were originally 92 military schools, 49 of which have been cut, and there are now 43, about half of which have been cut or more. As a result of the reorganization, a total of 1.1 million personnel were cut. (4) The resettlement of surplus officers and soldiers. After the troops were cut and reorganized, the resettlement of personnel was an urgent matter. Detailed methods were formulated to ensure that surplus personnel were placed in the right positions. For surplus officers, the first step was to establish officer corps to collect them by region. A total of 14 officer corps, 4 brigades, and 4 companies were established, collecting a total of more than 37,000 people. It is also stipulated that all newly established institutions or other personnel to be supplemented should be transferred from the officer corps as soon as possible. The second time, professional training is given according to their performance and wishes. This year, the transfer is currently stipulated that the Central Training Corps is the general institution for transfer training, entrusting relevant departments to set up various specialized technical training classes for practical training.

### This Year's Military Reorganization Plan

Since the War of Resistance has ended, this year is the stage of demobilization. The maintenance of the national army's military strength should be based on the principle of national defense and measure the country's economic strength, reducing it to the smallest possible elite troops. Therefore, a program was formulated to determine the goal of reducing it to 90 divisions within half a year, which is equal to one-half of the military strength in the early stage of the War of Resistance (26th year [1937]) and one-quarter of the military strength at the end of the War of Resistance (the end of the 33rd year [1944]). The main points are described as follows: (1) The current national army has 89 infantry armies, 240 divisions (including 3 divisions of the Eighteenth Group Army), 2 cavalry armies, and 13 divisions, totaling approximately 3.8 million people. It is planned to reorganize them into 90 divisions and 10 cavalry brigades, and retain approximately 1.8 million officers and soldiers, including special forces and service troops.

### The Entire National Army is Reorganized into 90 Divisions

(2) The reorganization period is divided into two phases, each phase lasting three months. The first phase reorganizes 44 armies, and the second phase reorganizes 45 armies. It is expected that the reorganization will be completed within half a year. The cavalry will not be reorganized in phases, and it is expected that all will be completed before June. (3) Each army will first reduce itself by one-third, that is, an army with three divisions and nine regiments will be reorganized into an army with three divisions and six regiments, and an army with two divisions and six regiments will be reorganized into an army with two divisions and four regiments, and then reorganized into 90 divisions according to the organization. The army headquarters that should be established after the reorganization will be formed by the headquarters of each group army. (4) Each independent division, brigade, and regiment will be merged into the army for reorganization. (5) The surplus special forces of each army and division after the reorganization may be allowed to retain and appropriately compile them into independent regiments under the direct jurisdiction of the Military Commission. (6) The puppet army and advancing guerrilla units that were compiled and dispatched last August must be compiled and abandoned within four months. (7) After each army and division has been compiled and reorganized in accordance with the prescribed organization, the treatment of officers and soldiers may be improved, hoping to achieve the goal of consistent treatment between military and civilians.

### The Resettlement of Surplus Officers and Soldiers, Specific Measures are Formulated

The resettlement of surplus officers and soldiers will continue the plan of the previous year and formulate specific measures as follows: (1) Approximately 1 million people are scheduled to be transferred from the group army (including 100,000 officers) and assigned to transportation, water conservancy, land reclamation, factories, local service teams, and other various traffic guards. (2) 200,000 people will be transferred individually (limited to military officers and subordinates). It is planned that after training, they will be assigned to administration, transportation, education, police, and other various national undertakings. (3) 500,000 people are scheduled to be dismissed and retired. All those who are old and weak and voluntarily return to their hometowns will be dismissed and retired in accordance with regulations.

### Regarding the Handling of Guerrilla Units and Puppet Troops

The compilation and merger of guerrilla units, advancing units, and local teams, etc., the principles of compilation and merger: (1) Those belonging to local teams should still be returned to the local government for proper placement. (2) Guerrilla advancing units, etc., should be gradually compiled and merged into the army and division in accordance with the national army's compilation and reorganization of guerrilla units, and then abolished. (3) All surplus officers with formal qualifications will be recruited and trained for unified placement. During the recruitment and training period, they will be treated in accordance with 80% of the new salary. Compilation and merger process: (1) There were originally 160 guerrilla units, 38 detachments, and 203 battalions, with a total of 720,271 officers and soldiers and 144,680 guns. (2) As of the end of the 34th year [1945], except for the five columns of the Twelfth War Zone that have not yet been reorganized, the rest have been mostly transferred to regular troops, and a part has been reorganized into 18 security regiments, 22 replenishment regiments, and 4 guardianship regiments, totaling 101,000 people. The principle of management of the puppet army, the central government has decided to take compilation and dispatch as the basic principle for the handling of the puppet army. As for the officers, they are divided into four types: willingly surrendering, opportunistic, forced to be coerced, and sent to instigate rebellion, and they are handled separately according to the principal and subordinate. Regarding the handling situation, according to the reports of the Army Headquarters and various war zones, there are a total of 51 puppet army units (excluding the Northeast), with approximately 600,000 people. Since the national army entered the recovered area, except for the 3rd, 6th, 7th, and 9th war zones and the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th armies south of the Yangtze River, the order has been generally established, and all puppet troops have been compiled and dispatched in accordance with the plan, totaling more than 200,000 people. As for the areas north of the Yangtze River, such as the 2nd, 5th, 10th, 11th, and 12th war zones, approximately 400,000 people, except for those who have been compiled and dispatched, there are approximately 200,000 people whose circumstances have not yet been able to be compiled and dispatched as expected. The headquarters stipulates that it must be completed within four months. The above is a brief description of the headquarters' plan for military reorganization and the implementation process since the beginning of last year. The headquarters has conducted a self-examination and is well aware that there are many shortcomings and that it is far from the goal of building an army. From now on, we can only work hard to study and improve on the one hand, and strive to implement it on the other, in order to achieve the policies determined by the central government and complete the initial great cause of army building, in order to live up to the expectations of Chairman Chiang and the people of the whole country. (To be continued)

Chairman Chiang Delivers a Speech at the Opening Ceremony of the Consultative Conference

### China's First Cardinal, Tian Gengxin, Came from Humble Origins

— Translated by Our Newspaper Translation Department from the Great American Evening News

Recently, the Roman Pontiff (commonly known as the Pope), Pius XII, elected Bishop Tian Gengxin as a Cardinal of the Roman Curia. Bishop Tian is the first Chinese person to be elected to this important position in the Vatican, which is a pioneering event in Chinese history.

### Turmoil in Europe, Tian is Promoted to Bishop

Bishop Tian was promoted to the position of bishop in Rome in October 1939, during the Christian festival. At that time, the flames of war were spreading across the European continent, and large numbers of troops were being dispatched. It was an extraordinary period of great turmoil. However, in Rome, Bishop Tian and eleven other newly ordained bishops of different nationalities quietly prostrated themselves at the steps of the altar, respectfully listening to Pope Pius XII recite a document praying for world peace and universal harmony. After that, Bishop Tian packed his bags and prepared to return to his motherland to carry out his sacred mission.

### One Horse-Drawn Carriage Passes Through a Dangerous Zone

First, Bishop Tian went from China to Rome, and had experienced many hardships. He started from the interior of China, took a horse-drawn carriage, passed through the dangerous fire line, traveled more than 200 miles, and finally took a train to Shanghai, completing the first leg of his journey. From there, he transferred to the "Xianghuosi" ship, took the route through Hong Kong, Manila, and set off for Suez. When he was on the turbulent ocean, the flames of war in Europe had become irreversible. The ship had to sail to Kobe. Bishop Tian returned to Shanghai from there and boarded the "Chai'er" to Naples.

### Rags to Riches, with Profound Family Learning

Bishop Tian came from humble origins, and few cardinals have come from more humble beginnings than him. His family has lived in a small village in Shandong - Zhangqiu - for generations. His father received a good education, was proficient in Chinese classics, and obtained a degree. He lived a teacher's life for nearly 25 years. In 1892, he worked as a professor of Chinese literature at a Catholic seminary. In 1898, he was baptized as a Catholic, and died the following year. In 1915, the bishop's mother was also baptized and died in 1922.

Bishop Tian was born on October 24, 1890, and lived with his parents in a village in Yanggu County. At the age of ten, he was sent to a church school in Boli (transliteration) to study Chinese classics and study doctrine. He was baptized in 1900, and in August 1904, he entered the Boli Junior Seminary to study. On June 9, 1918, he took the position of priest and began to carry out his sacred duties in Shanxian, Shandong. For the next two years, he studied and practiced in the Divine Word Society, and then returned there to resume his actual church work. In 1932, he was assigned as the acting pastor of Boxing County. On February 24, 1934, he was appointed as the papal envoy. In July 1939, he was elected as the papal envoy pastor of Yangxin County. In October of the same year, he was personally ordained as a bishop by Pope Pius XII. Fortunately, Bishop Tian's cross was personally awarded by the Pope, and it contained a valuable relic of the Holy Cross.

A church member who had known Bishop Tian for more than 20 years said that he was the first and always a "shepherd of the Holy Spirit." From the beginning, he was an exemplary pastor, and his tireless enthusiasm and steadfast piety made him rise to his current honorary position.

Bishop Tian is not only loyal to the missionary cause, but also attaches great importance to education. He recently planned to establish a middle school in Qingdao.

### Studying Scriptures and Performing Sacred Work

Bishop Tian is kind and approachable in his dealings with people, and his demeanor is dignified. He is deeply respected by the church members of the continent and people from all walks of life. In addition to his native language, he is also proficient in English and German, and can be said to be a rare talent with both good character and learning. However, Bishop Tian has always been humble and never conceited. Perhaps Bishop Tian will feel flattered by his honor as China's first cardinal this time.

Catholicism has been introduced into China since the late Ming Dynasty, and it has been more than 300 years since then. There are Catholic believers all over China, but naturally, compared to the total population, this number still accounts for a very small percentage. We cannot deny that the spread of Catholicism has had a positive influence on China. We believe that Bishop Tian Gengxin's appointment as a cardinal will lead to a closer connection and deeper integration between Eastern morality and Western spirit, which contains the significance of not only increasing our international honor, but also being of great importance to the future of our nation.

The Second Landlord Acts Like a Fox Borrowing the Tiger's Authority

Editor: We, the undersigned, reside at No. 973, Zhongzheng Middle Road, Tongren Road, a total of 21 households. The house was previously operated by Zhao Wenqiu, the second landlord, who opened the Weilai Hotel. After cleaning up, the business was closed, and all water and electricity expenses were self-paid. After the victory, Zhao Wenqiu suddenly had a whimsical idea and wanted to sell the business to others to reopen the hotel. Therefore, he first asked the tenants to illegally increase the rent in order to drive them out, and wanted to charge 1,000 yuan per room per day according to the hotel charging method. The tenants refused because the house did not have hotel facilities and could not charge so much. At the same time, because the second landlord was applying for a hotel license, they inquired with the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau. After the bureau sent personnel to investigate, they found the tenants' reasons to be valid and revoked the license, and replied in a public letter No. 296, City Finance Photo 35 on January 9. Unexpectedly, when the second landlord saw that this plan did not work, he came up with another evil plan. At 12:00 midnight on January 15, he suddenly arrived with police officers No. "3133" and No. "2665" who claimed to be from the Jing'an Temple Police Station and checked the rooms of each tenant. This kind of behavior has never happened in more than ten years. The tenants were woken up from their sleep unexpectedly and were mostly frightened. Those who opened the door a little late were rewarded with a slap in the face. In addition to individually asking about their occupation and name, the two police officers also showed real guns to threaten them, ordering each tenant to hand over the key to the room and equip them with the same key for the use of the second landlord. In this way, the personal property of each tenant is not guaranteed at all. If a theft occurs, who will be responsible? Moreover, since the police came to check the rooms, they did not check the room of Mr. Lin En, a British national living in the same apartment. Now that China has leaped to become one of the four great powers, it is even more incomprehensible that the police still value foreigners and despise Chinese so much, and create such distinctions. Therefore, we have specially written a letter to inform you and ask you to make it public, and to know whether the second landlord's behavior is legal and what basis the two police officers have. How can we enjoy the freedom of residence? We also ask for guidance, which would be greatly appreciated! All tenants of No. 973, Zhongzheng Middle Road, Sincerely.

Editorial

### We Also Shed Tears to Speak

On the opening day of the Political Consultative Conference, Mr. Shao Cong'en, a venerable old man of 75, made a sincere appeal, saying, "I came to the meeting despite my illness, shedding tears as I speak," which moved the entire assembly. If all the attending members possessed conscience, the situation of the conference over the past week should have been filled with even more frequent good news. However, according to reports from various sources, while heated debates and lively discussions were seen at the conference, the destruction of roads and mines on the battlefields continued unabated. Moreover, in the general assembly on the 16th, Mr. Shao Lizi also very gently asked everyone to speak fairly. It is evident that the previous Mr. Shao's tears and words did not achieve the expected effect, causing the other Mr. Shao to become anxious and appeal for fairness. We journalists, being neither members of the "Political Consultative Conference" nor having formed any association in our capacity as journalists, even if political parties participate in the "Political Consultative Conference," can say a few words from outside the conference. Though we dare not claim to be fair, we can at least represent a portion of the populace. Today, we also follow Mr. Shao, shedding tears as we speak, hoping that the gentlemen of the "Political Consultative Conference" will not ignore that it contains the endless blood and tears of the people!

First and foremost, the common people ask the gentlemen of the Political Consultative Conference to be true to their word. We have no time to inquire which party or faction you represent, or whether you represent only yourselves without belonging to any party or faction. It would be wonderful if the common people could live in peace and prosperity, allowing you to do as you please. However, when you hold meetings, you must first have a common principle to adhere to, at least achieving "being true to your word." Otherwise, even if you deceive yourselves temporarily, you cannot deceive the eyes and ears of the world. If anyone's words are not to be trusted, even ordinary friendships cannot be maintained; what is the point of forming a party? What is the point of consultation? Before the conference, the Communist Party already extensively publicized its willingness for "unconditional ceasefire," saying extremely sweet words! You gentlemen love to hear it, and we also love to hear it. However, the ceasefire order has been issued for many days, and telegrams and leaflets can reach remote villages. Why, then, did the Communist army attack its rear, occupy Yingkou, and invade Panshan on the day the National Army entered Shenyang? Why is there still a cloud of war over Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and Jehol? Why is the Communist army in southern Shanxi fiercely attacking Quwo, and the Communist army in Suiyuan besieging Jining? If they are destroying railways and damaging coal mines, why is their style unchanged, still prevalent everywhere? The Communist Party constantly says it is for the country and the people, and the common people only hope that is the case. However, five months after victory and nearly ten days of consultation, what we hear is still firing, still attacking cities, still destroying roads, still damaging mines. Even if the Military Mediation Execution Department is established, who can respect and obey it? The ancients said, "Beautiful words are not trustworthy," "Eloquent words are not good." Today, we finally understand that the sweet words of "unconditional ceasefire" are truly too beautiful and too eloquent! But you gentlemen should calculate: How many fleeting days have passed under the anesthesia of these beautiful and eloquent words? How much have the lives and property of the common people been sacrificed? The common people cannot return home, have no place to voice their grievances, and today have the right to make a demand to the gentlemen of the "Political Consultative Conference": If you do not speak, so be it; if you speak, you must be trustworthy, not only "say what you will do" but also "do what you have said." Any of you gentlemen must not only be trustworthy yourselves but also be responsible for preventing others from breaking their promises. If you gentlemen forget this premise and merely want to engage in abstract discussions at the meeting, discussing "topics" widely without seeking practicality, saying things but denying them afterward, breaking promises and still claiming to be party leaders, then the people of the country will not be indebted to you, but you will indeed be indebted to the people of the country.

Secondly, the common people only hope for "returning power to the people, returning the military to the state." These eight characters are also the ten characters of "political democratization, nationalization of the army" agreed upon by both the government and the Communist Party in the Double Tenth Agreement. When the Political Consultative Conference meets, your responsibility lies in discussing the steps to realize these eight or ten characters. Beyond this, you gentlemen have no right to interfere; and if you do not strive for this, you will fail the national government's convocation. Returning power to the people, by natural law, means returning power to the common people, returning power to the National Assembly, not returning power to any one party or faction, or any few parties or factions, let alone returning power to some consultative conference arbitrarily formed by a few people. Whether it is a party, a faction, a society, an association, consultation, or a conference, if it has not been elected by the common people, no one can claim to be a representative who can accept the national government's return of power, and no conference can intend to replace the future National Assembly. If even this is not understood, thinking that gathering a group of people is enough to boast and take the stage, calling themselves democratic, and believing themselves to be the source of power, then today the "Rural Construction Society" can become a faction, why can't the "Municipal Association" become a faction tomorrow? Today the "Vocational Education Society" can become a faction, why can't the "Children's Education Society" become a faction tomorrow? Today the "Democratic League" can be called a party, why can't the "Democratic National Construction Association" be called a party tomorrow? Today the "National Liberation Action Committee" can be called a party. Why can't the "China Labor Association" be called a party tomorrow? Today you gentlemen can be praised as social elites, tomorrow some gentry and some workers are also social elites, and are social elites limited to just these few people? You gentlemen should consider, if it is said that with the Political Consultative Conference or the Political Participation Council, the National Assembly can be postponed, and with party factionalism, the government can be reorganized, and the National Assembly is delayed, wouldn't it be laughable! The National Government originally scheduled the National Assembly to be convened in the winter of the 26th year, but it was repeatedly postponed due to the War of Resistance. Since everyone wants to see the end of the period of political tutelage and the return of power to the people as soon as possible, there is naturally only one way: convening the National Assembly as scheduled on May 5th. Today, the common people will not allow the national government to break its promise to the people again under any pretext, and the representatives elected by the people according to law have no reason to obey any individual or organization that can arbitrarily deny or cancel it. People suffer from not knowing themselves! We ask those who loudly advocate the cancellation of representatives to first examine themselves: By what qualification can they freely and loudly deny the representatives elected by the people! We believe that whether the government is sincere in returning power to the people depends on whether it still convenes the National Assembly as scheduled, and whether the gentlemen of the Political Consultative Conference are sincere in consulting on returning power to the people also depends on whether the conference can agree on specific measures for convening the National Assembly on May 5th.

As for "returning the military to the state," that is even simpler. The so-called returning the military to the state means that no party, individual, or local area is allowed to have troops; only the state is allowed to have troops. In other words, only the central government is allowed to have the supreme power of military administration and military command. Based on this point, any reorganization, training, deployment, selection, and management of any troops should be entirely determined by the central government. Now that the National Army has already abolished the Kuomintang's party branches, and its command belongs to the supreme commander of the state, what needs to be resolved at present is the issue of reorganizing the Communist army. There should be no dodging and weaving, avoiding the main topic. Mr. Zhang Qun once said that if the reorganization of the Communist army is not completed, the cessation of conflict cannot be considered a permanent peace. What the common people care about, and what has been hanging in the balance for several years, is how to rein in this Communist army that is "waiting for a price to be assessed." Last spring, when the government and the Communist Party representatives met in Xi'an, the Communist Party requested to organize twelve divisions, and the government agreed to organize ten divisions. Later, when Mao Zedong went to Chongqing, the Communist Party suddenly requested to organize forty-eight divisions, and after repeated consultations, at least twenty divisions. Other countries are reducing troops after the war, but the Communist Party wants to increase troops after the war, which is extremely strange! Moreover, the Communist Party demands where its troops must be stationed and that its officers must be recommended by it. If it is as they say, then it is "returning the military to the state" in name, but "keeping the military to the party" in reality! The common people's request is very simple and clear. When the government reorganizes the Communist army, it may discuss the number, but after the reorganization, how the defense areas, supplies, officers, training, and deployment should be absolutely the same as the general National Army, with no exceptions whatsoever. Otherwise, how is it different from the Zhou Dynasty's feudalism and the Tang Dynasty's warlords? Moreover, the reorganization of the army was originally scheduled to be negotiated by a separate three-person military group, but at this time the Communist Party is deliberately changing the game and wants to drag it into the "Political Consultative Conference" to delay the time. What is their sincerity? What is their credibility? The Communist Party representative, Lu Dingyi, always says "forced onto Liangshan." Even if they are forced, then the "heroes of Liangshan" who demand "amnesty and enlistment" must also take down their long-held independent banner as soon as possible! If the gentlemen of the Political Consultative Conference only know how to perfunctorily accommodate and only seek temporary appearances, without promoting the immediate reorganization of the Communist army by the military group, they will inevitably greatly violate the true meaning of "returning the military to the state," which is not what the common people expect.

We, the common people, have suffered enough for eight years! We have suffered the bitterness of being slaughtered by violent enemies, the bitterness of being oppressed by traitors, the bitterness of being exploited by corrupt officials, the bitterness of being harassed by bandits and guerrillas, the bitterness of the Communist army attacking cities, looting land, destroying roads, and damaging mines, the bitterness of being exploited by the puppet currency of the traitors, and even the bitterness of being forced by the Communist army to use "resistance currency" to plunder supplies!... Future disasters are great, and suffering is endless! Today, a ray of light lies entirely in the "Political Consultative Conference." We respectfully shed tears on behalf of the common people and appeal to the "Political Consultative Conference," hoping that you gentlemen can truly do as Mr. Zhou Enlai said, "Be responsible to the country, be responsible to the people," and everyone, with a clear conscience, speak fairly, earnestly discuss measures, immediately cease fire, and urge the government to return power to the people and supervise the Communist Party to return the military to the state. Whichever side breaks its promise, may we abandon it together with the world!

Fa Hua Town is Pitch Black

Dear Editor: Our district, located west of Shanghai (named Fa Hua Town), is divided into East, Central, and West Towns. It extends from Hai Ge Road and Lu Jia Road in the east to Da Xi Road and Kai Xuan Road in the west. The entire town is about three li long, with many shops and a large population. Before the war, there were streetlights. After the national army moved west, it was under the trampling of enemy bandits. Many were incomplete. Later, due to the enemy and puppet's lighting restrictions, they were forced to be demolished. As a result, the entire town was almost plunged into a world of darkness at night. During this period, bandits took the opportunity to come out at night, looting people's property or stripping their clothes, making the journey extremely difficult. Since the liberation of our city, we have heard that the authorities have begun to install streetlights in various districts in order, but we have not heard of any such plans for our district. The people of our district yearn for light, and specially ask the relevant authorities to install them quickly. This can slightly improve public security. We deeply hope that the authorities will adopt this suggestion, and the people of the entire Fa Hua area will be fortunate! Sincerely, Tao Ziyuan, a citizen of Fa Hua Town.

### Bulls Take Profits at Highs, Gold Market Sentiment is Muted, New Hong Kong Notes Continue Downward

Shanghai—The market opened flat yesterday. Recent rumors and speculation about new exchange rates were reported in both the North China Daily News and this newspaper, quoting information from financial authorities refuting the rumors. This caused sentiment to shift from excitement to muted. Therefore, although the market reached 936,000 after opening, there were plenty of bulls taking profits at the highs. Sichuan banks also offered supply, and the market soon declined again. US dollars remained loose and plentiful, with a swap price of 625 yuan. There were swap sellers in the gold market, causing the price to fall to 913,000. Thereafter, demand and supply gradually became balanced, and the market entered a stable state, hovering around 920,000. There was no change at noon. Both current and forward markets were fluctuating slightly around 920,000. As a result, the closing price fell by 8,000 compared to the previous session. Gold jewelry was priced at 99,000, silver at 700 yuan, and silver dollars fluctuated at 460. The unofficial interest rate remained between 8% and 11%, but there were not many positions. Both the stock and gold markets felt the pressure. Major players tried every means possible but were still not satisfied with the current market prices. Some in the industry are gradually taking the opportunity to exit. Although there may be a rally in the future, it is likely to be a lot of fluctuation.

Foreign Exchange—US dollars still lack special stimulation. Physical dollars continue to flow out. At the start of trading, the swap price for gold reached around 625 yuan. Therefore, there was swap buying at the lows. Although the process was in a downtrend, it was still very peaceful. After 1,500 yuan, it followed the gold price and fell slightly. At noon and in the afternoon, it was sluggish around 1,480 yuan. The swap price was slightly reduced. The final swap price was 620 yuan per ten taels. Old Hong Kong dollars recovered 10 yuan due to demand from Guangdong banks. New Hong Kong dollars, however, continued to be sold off due to disappointment from excessive speculation. Guangdong banks did not have the appetite at this price and continued to decline. As a result, the closing price fell by another 3 yuan compared to the previous session.

### Government Bonds Reach Saturation Point, All Parties Wait and See, Both Chinese and Foreign Stocks are Weakening

Government bonds continued to gather strength under sporadic trading. They rose first and then fell, but remained stable in the end. Although more funds were absorbed by Type C bonds, it was difficult to exceed the 2,000 mark. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, Type A, B, and D bonds each rose by 120 yuan, Type C bonds rose by 50 yuan, and Type E bonds rose by 70 yuan. All parties are waiting and seeing.

The Chinese stock market was stable. Major hot stocks fluctuated above the previous closing price. However, the less popular stocks softened again due to a lack of speculation and someone looking to sell. After 11 o'clock, the corridor was too crowded, and many wires were broken, causing disputes and interference. The market closed earlier. As a result, Wing On Textile rose slightly, Mei Ah remained flat, and the three minor hot stocks fell slightly.

Foreign stocks were slightly stable yesterday. The process fluctuated. In general, hot stocks showed signs of recovery. Cold stocks and rubber stocks were slightly weak due to few buyers. The result at the noon close, compared to the previous close, showed that the hot stocks of Ewo Cotton Mill, Ewo Yarns, Paper Industries, Union Insurance Society of Canton, and Wheelock & Co. all rebounded, while rubber stocks fell slightly.

### Cotton Cloth Trading is Sparse, Sichuan Banks Absorb Light-Colored Goods

The cotton cloth market stabilized yesterday. There were some transactions in Shi Lin blue cloth from Hankou banks. However, because some factories such as Xinfu and Xinfeng had already opened in small quantities, and there was still a lot of spot goods remaining in the market, a supply-demand balance was created. With the New Year approaching, it is necessary to put on the brakes and temporarily come to a conclusion. Sichuan banks continued to absorb light-colored goods such as striped poplin and silk for spring sales. Other than that, there were only sporadic transactions, embellishing the market. White cloth and fine cloth are still in short supply, so dyeing and weaving factories are very interested in those with large amounts of spot goods.

### Yarn Market is Stable

The yarn market was very lackluster yesterday. There were few transactions from customer banks, and the industry was also taking a wait-and-see attitude. Spot goods from double-thread mills had a way out to weaving factories and were considered stable. 20-count and 16-count yarn fell by about 10,000 yuan. Sentiment was scattered, and the trend showed signs of weakness. Yarn factories and spinning construction companies were inclined to sell, and some hoarders, who had been holding on for many years, were also found in the market.

### Rice Prices are Slightly Weak, Flour Exports are Active

The rice market in North China turned weak. Store appetite remained low. Both southern and northern japonica rice were weak by 100-200 yuan. White indica rice was also weak by over 100 yuan. There were more arrivals in the oil market, and exports were stagnant. Store appetite was not strong, and it fell by another thousand yuan. Sales were sluggish. Soybean cake tended to be flat. Soybeans also lacked prosperity. Raw peanuts, with a surge in arrivals from Linhuai Pass, saw a sharp increase of nearly 2,000 yuan. However, flour was active in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang markets, and prices continued to rise sharply, increasing by another hundred yuan.

### Rayon Prices Rise Again, Artificial Silk Also Rises by 10%

The rayon market opened yesterday with 120 denier rayon at 1,300,000 yuan at the Sky Bridge, and transactions were immediately made. The highest price was 1,400,000 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,320,000 yuan at closing. In the afternoon, it continued to trade at 1,350,000 yuan, which was 150,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Warehouse receipts had a minimum of 950,000 yuan and a maximum of 990,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it traded at 970,000 yuan. The price fluctuations were unstable, and trading suddenly became lively. Some were selling spot goods at high prices and buying warehouse receipts to cover, while others were selling warehouse receipts and buying spot goods to cover. There were many transactions between industry players, with warehouse receipts being the most common. Wu Chang had the strongest buying interest. Factory managers, who had been depressed for days, were also unwilling to show weakness yesterday. Artificial silk rose by 10% compared to the previous day. There were transactions between industry players and customer banks. Silk goods initially advanced in trading, but the market later recovered slightly. Mei Ah bedspreads traded at 810,000 yuan per hundred, with a high of 850,000 yuan, later trading at 775,000 yuan. Da Cheng ge bi crepe traded at a maximum of 2,450 yuan per yard, later trading at 2,300 yuan. Minsheng brocade traded at a price of 11,000 yuan per piece.

### Silk Weavers Request the Release of Sealed Raw Materials

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The Silk Weavers' Industry Association was reorganized and established on the 15th. The association, in view of the recent soaring prices of raw materials and the inability of silk goods prices to catch up, which will inevitably force manufacturers to stop work and affect the lives of workers, plans to jointly request the authorities to allocate the sealed raw materials for silk weaving in warehouses to various factories in order to stabilize market prices and maintain the lives of workers.

### After the Lifting of Controls, Inland Yarn Mills Are Active

The major textile mills in the rear areas, which were previously subject to the control of the Flower and Yarn Bureau, had their original stockpiles purchased by the bureau and processed by the bureau using the method of exchanging flowers for yarn and yarn for cloth, collecting processing fees. Since the end of the War of Resistance, the control measures were abolished on November 15, 1945. The factories, depleted of raw materials and funds, mostly fell into a state of suspension or reduced production for a time. The bureau then approved the return of cotton stored in 1943 to the factories at 60% of its value. It has been learned that factories such as Cai Jiapu, Xianyang, Yejing, Yufeng, Yuhua, Shenxin, and Shashi Dahua, with the amount of raw materials returned being limited and a portion difficult to allocate immediately, have applied to the National Bank for loans to purchase raw materials.

### White Coal Nuggets are Slightly Lower, Anthracite Fine Coal is Stable

Coal market conditions are diverging. White coal nuggets are experiencing lower prices due to sluggish sales. Many distributors are discounting prices due to tight credit, but there are still few buyers, and prices may fall further. Anthracite coal blocks have been rising for days, and some are spitting out at high prices, but there is limited physical goods. As real end-users search for purchases, the market atmosphere has become stronger. Anthracite coal fines are slightly moving at factory sales, and prices are rising with the anthracite coal blocks.

### Road Iron is Selling Well

6/20 Road Iron, commonly known as packing iron, has been in high demand recently due to the smooth flow of the Yangtze River ships, convenient transportation, and frequent exchange of goods. Actual sales are increasing daily, and customer banks are also purchasing a lot, so prices are firm. It currently sells for around 300,000 yuan per ton.

### Stores and Customer Banks Compete to Handle, Tea Sales Are Extremely Active

Regarding red and green tea varieties, the stores on this street are very interested in adding new varieties in order to meet the needs of the market. Sales from customer banks are also not bad, so trading has been extremely active in recent days, and prices are showing sharp strength.

### Labor Dispute Resolved Soon, New York Cotton Market Balanced

[Reuters, New York, 18th] The New York cotton market opened steadily yesterday. The rumor of a potential strike resolution caused the prices to go up two to four points. The rumors from Washington of potential massive amounts of low-grade cotton to be shipped to occupied nations garnered attention, but the cotton market remained unaffected. Traders maintained a wait-and-see attitude. The prices increased one to three points around noon. The prices then fell at the end of the afternoon, as well as a large amount of searches for purchases. A surge in the number of purchases increased the prices. The market remained very stable in the end due to minimal sales.

### US Department of Agriculture Approves Production Volume This Year

### Crackdown on Speculation

The financial authorities of this city have recently noted that speculation in the market is increasing, and have dispatched personnel to conduct a strict investigation. In particular, the recent failure of short sellers in the bond market to deliver goods has caused disputes, which is taken very seriously and will be resolutely cracked down on.

### Market Summary

The price of Longan from various locations is rising. The top-quality large-sized longan opened at 2,000 yuan higher yesterday, with more than a hundred transactions. Because the market activity for large pieces of dried longan is high, opening prices were also tight, with high-quality goods rising by nearly 10%. Orders for saccharin in the western medicine market are about to begin, and pharmacies have already started selling in advance.

Among the cosmetics market prices yesterday, only soap was firm. Customer banks were searching for it at high prices.

Knitted goods were slightly higher in price yesterday due to the smaller amount of goods in circulation. Yanshou cotton sweaters, which had been quiet for several days, rebounded yesterday, with fifty or sixty dozen transactions.

With Wing Tai Wo continuing to distribute cigarettes and Hua Shang and other factories also distributing, the spot goods on the market increased suddenly. With supply exceeding demand, the market is trending downward.

The issue of reopening the Hua Shang Yarn and Cloth Exchange has not yet been approved by the financial authorities. Although the industry's reorganization committee has an active plan for reopening, it must wait for an order from the authorities before it can proceed. Rumors that the exchange will reopen this month are inaccurate.

The four small factories sold by the Bureau for the Disposal of Puppet Industries in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui region, including the Tianzhong Mining Factory, the Wanguo Rubber Machinery and Goods Factory, the Shanghai Automatic Punishment Machine Factory, and the Qinghe Factory, have had their property rights disputed by the Zhonghua Brothers Company Iron Factory, which has appealed to the relevant authorities.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The British steamer SS Chanda arrived in Shanghai on the 12th of this month with 4,000 tons of relief supplies from New York. It docked at Qichang Pier in Pudong to unload its cargo, which is now cleared.

The Guiyang steamer, managed by the British Far East Shipping Company, is also scheduled to depart for Hong Kong today, carrying 23,000 bags of relief flour. Since the ban on transporting cotton yarn and cloth overseas, such goods have disappeared from ships sailing to Hong Kong. Yesterday, while loading the Guiyang steamer, a large batch of cotton cloth and Ajinomoto was discovered mixed in with medicinal materials. Customs officers seized these goods. It is reported that the smuggled cotton cloth was being transported by Shen'an Transportation Company, and the Ajinomoto was declared by Shenchangxiang Transportation Company, both disguised as medicinal materials when reporting to the shipping company. The amount seized during loading was considerable, but the exact figure is unknown.

### On the Issue of Private School Tuition Fees: The Municipal Education Bureau Convenes a Meeting with Principals and Reaches a Compromise

[Dahua News Agency] To resolve the issue of private school tuition fees, the Municipal Education Bureau held a discussion meeting with principals of private primary and secondary schools at 2:00 PM yesterday at the bureau. Principals from more than 300 schools, including Minguo, Aiguo, Mingde, Daozhong, Cunde, and Zhengfeng, attended. Bureau Director Gu, directors of various departments, and Inspector Cheng Kuancheng of the Ministry of Education were present. Director Gu gave a report, stating: "I am well aware of the financial difficulties of private schools. Although the fee standards set by the bureau are very different from those agreed upon with the schools, they were based on the affordability of parents. If the full amount is distributed to teachers, their livelihoods should not be a problem. As for school operating expenses, the bureau originally intended for each school to be responsible, but it is now known that the school boards cannot maintain this. The bureau will request the mayor's assistance so that education in the city can develop day by day. As for increasing tuition fees, the municipal government and the bureau originally could not advise it, but what can we do if parents cannot afford it? It is best to compromise: on the one hand, please solicit donations from parents, and the bureau will not interfere." Subsequently, representatives from private schools, including Jiang Jizhou, Sun Xiangzhong, Cui Jianwu, and Wei Dunyi, listed several difficulties, which Director Gu answered separately:

Director's Opinion

(Point 1) The method adopted in the past was the Soviet Union's fee system. Soviet schools were all public, so the situation was slightly different, and there were no difficulties. The situation in this city is different, so this method will be discussed and implemented after the establishment of the Municipal Council. (Point 2) The previously set tuition fee standards were to avoid criticism from public opinion and to consider the burden on parents, so there was a loan program from the Municipal Bank, and it was also planned to request the mayor to allow primary schools to increase tuition by 2,000, junior high schools by 3,000, and senior high schools by 4,000, and to ask economically affluent parents to donate free school places and equipment. Inspector Cheng of the Ministry of Education reported that the Chongqing Municipal Government had previously restricted private school tuition fees, with senior high school fees capped at 15,000 yuan, and the school board was responsible for the shortfall. The situation in Shanghai is special, and few school boards can bear this responsibility. It is fortunate for the future of Shanghai education that the heads of the schools can openly discuss with the competent authorities.

Private School Requests

Later, private schools made several requests: (1) They requested the municipal government to issue a subsidy of 5,400 in the second semester. (2) They requested that a portion of the enemy and puppet properties be used as a subsidy and compensation for the losses of various schools. (3) The municipal government's allocation of school funding is not sufficient in fact, because 50% of the municipal government's income has been used for police bureau expenses. After the Municipal Council is established, they will request an increase. Finally, Director Gu replied: "I will do my best to contact the relevant parties. As for tuition fees, if you still think there are difficulties, I am still willing to help find a solution." Therefore, if private school tuition fees are not changed again next semester, the approximate amounts will be 8,000 yuan for primary schools, 12,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 16,000 yuan for senior high schools.

### Black and White Team Makes a Lasting Impression: Defeats Chen Hong by One Point Yesterday; Hehe Potassium Fertilizer Friend Cup: Xie Xing Beats Shan Team

In the Chenyou Cup basketball league, there were two matches last night. In the final match, the Black and White team of the Expeditionary Force faced the Chenyou Hong team. The audience was extremely enthusiastic, and the atmosphere in the Youth Hall was feverish.

In the first league match, Donghua played against Xie Xing. Donghua's performance was not weak, and Xie Xing found it difficult to win. The first half was a seesaw battle, with the score difference only one or two points. The final score was tied at 17 each. After the break, the game remained tight. Although Zhang Banglun and Zhang Lingen of Donghua were fouled out four times, their fighting power did not diminish. Until the end of the game, Xie Xing only won by a narrow margin of 34 to 32.

Next, the Shan team played against the Green Forest team. The situation was also very tense, because the Green Forest players performed well, and even a strong team like the Shan team felt it was difficult. In the first half, Green Forest was only one point behind at 8 to 9. After switching sides, the Shan team gradually gained the upper hand, while the Green Forest team lacked the energy. When the final buzzer sounded, the Shan team won 22 to 14, maintaining their undefeated honor.

In the final match, the Black and White team played against the Chenyou Hong team. The latter was resting and prepared, so they led from the beginning, leading 15 to 8 in the first half. After the break, Chenyou Hong underestimated their opponent and made frequent mistakes, allowing the Black and White team to seize the opportunity. In the last minute, Yao Hongsen scored, reversing the defeat and winning 33 to 32, defeating Chenyou Hong.

The Black and White team played four matches during this visit to Shanghai, with half wins and half losses. Their performance was still good, and their sportsmanship was particularly good, which was appreciated by fans. Now that their schedule here is over, they are scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to Xixi today.

The results of the three matches last night are as follows:

Xie Xing defeated Donghua (A): 34 to 32

Shan Team defeated Green Forest (A): 22 to 14

Black and White defeated Chenyou Hong (Friendship): 33 to 32

### A New Nation, A New Education

— Ke Zhi

— Introducing the "National College of Social Education" —

With a heart filled with excitement and sincerity, on a clear winter afternoon, this writer arrived at the temporary location of the National College of Social Education in Bishan, Sichuan. Bishan, an obscure small mountain town, quietly lies nestled among the mountains about sixty kilometers northwest of Chongqing. The Yu-Cheng Highway winds its way through here. The college is located on a high slope in the northwest corner of the town. As I climbed a hundred or so stone steps, between rows of ancient trees lining the path, the signboard of the "National College of Social Education" gloriously unfolded before my eyes.

The melodious sound of a piano seemed to welcome me, a visiting guest. Inside the gate was a wide and open sports field, where many students were actively engaged in various ball games. The surroundings of the field looked very clean and tidy, and the air was filled with vitality and harmony everywhere.

Chen Lijiang as President

I met President Chen Lijiang in a secluded and simple guest room. Mr. Chen is a leading educational scholar in China. He has been engaged in social education work for nearly twenty years. He has made the greatest contribution to the preservation of Chinese social education's development today. He has made indelible contributions to the establishment of social education theory and the advancement of social education causes. He has the demeanor of a typical educator: kind, gentle, generous, and eloquent in conversation, which demonstrates his rich scholarship and abundant vitality. He seems to possess a kind of touching power over young people in general, which makes a stranger feel close and a familiar person feel warm.

The National College of Social Education was established in the autumn of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), with only four years of history to date. When it was first established, the third and fourth-year students of the Social Education Department of Jiangsu Provincial College of Education and the College of Education of Great China University were ordered to merge into the college. Therefore, there have been four graduating classes with more than 300 graduates, scattered in many social education institutions and schools throughout the country, carrying forward the educational spirit of the college and winning general praise from society.

Contributions of Experts

Several famous scholars and experts have come to participate in the creation of this undertaking. Mr. Chen Lijiang has been in charge of the college since its inception. In addition, experts such as Zhuang Zeyi, Du Zuozhou, Qiu Chun, Xu Deheng, Chang Zhi, Chen Jianhong, Jiang Qi, Chen Dongyuan, Yu Songhua, Tong Runzhi, Zhu Yisong, Lü Fengzi, Dong Zhichuan, Jiao Juyin, Zhang Junxiang, and Liu Xuechang have all contributed or are currently contributing their greatest energy and wisdom to promote the greater development of this undertaking.

The college currently has four academic departments, three specialized courses, and one academic group, namely the Department of Social Education Administration, the Department of Social Work Administration, the Department of Library and Museum Science, the Department of Journalism, the Specialized Course in Radio and Visual Education, the Specialized Course in Art Education, the Specialized Course in Mandarin Education, and the Group of Ritual and Custom Administration. In terms of organization, the Group of Ritual and Custom Administration is attached to the Department of Social Work Administration, but the number of people in this group is particularly large, and it has become an independent class in form.

Students from all over the country

Students come from all over the country, except for Xinjiang, Taiwan, Mongolia and Tibet. Although they come from different places, have different living habits, and have different beliefs, they live and study together in this educational environment and get along very harmoniously and intimately. Students receive a full scholarship. Tuition and meal expenses are waived, and a monthly allowance and a uniform fee are issued each semester. In addition, there are various scholarships to encourage students' moral character, academic diligence, research, and creation. Students' lives are very disciplined in all aspects, including daily life, diet, flag-raising exercises, and homework, all of which have a kind of automatic discipline. In the studios, in the library, in the clubs, and on the sports field, there is a sense of order and solemnity, filled with youthful vigor. Various research associations, dozens of wall newspapers along the cultural corridor, competitions in lectures, papers, sports, production, social services, etc., enhance their interests in all aspects and strengthen their desire for knowledge and enterprising spirit.

School as a Social Entity

The school and society are integrated, and they have done it quite thoroughly. In this environment, one can see that the phenomenon of "school socialization, social education" has quite developed the function of "school as a social and cultural center." For example, they have successively run six sessions of middle school-level tutoring classes, more than ten people's schools, and dozens of people's inquiry offices; during the winter and summer vacations, they conduct people's visits and surveys on rural economy, farmers' lives, and educational levels; provide job placement services; assist local governments in developing construction work; contact social groups to engage in various people's activities; regularly screen movies, perform dramas, and hold art exhibitions, photo exhibitions, and music performances to entertain the people; install airplanes, announce important telegrams, and report news to the people; and pay special attention to library promotion, establishing dozens of newspaper and reading rooms and organizing mobile libraries. They are doing all these things down-to-earth.

Open Course Selection

The college has also established a new model in China for the promotion of university education. The most important are "open course selection" and "public academic lectures." Open course selection is to give unemployed youth with a general university education level and public officials on the job the opportunity to learn the knowledge and skills they urgently need. All courses in each department of the college with vacant seats that are needed by the general youth outside the college are open for them to select and study, and lecture notes and reference materials are provided. In the past four years, more than 50 courses have been selected, and more than 600 students have been selected. Public academic lectures involve inviting famous scholars from home and abroad to give lectures at the college. A public notice is issued to the public in advance, welcoming the public to attend freely. In the past four years, there have been 68 lectures, with approximately 30,000 attendees from outside the college. In addition, "special topic Q&A" is held. If the public has specialized academic or technical questions, they can submit them to the college for answers or directly discuss them with a certain professor; the "Social Education Correspondence Research Society" is organized to assist social education practitioners in research and further study.

Promotion Committee Design

The many civil education undertakings and promotion work mentioned above are mostly designed and implemented by the "Promotion Committee." In terms of academic research, there is the establishment of a "Research Department" as a central institution for researching social education academic and social education methods. Currently, the Research Department is headed by the famous education scholar Mr. Zhuang Zeyi. The work of the Research Department is to assist teachers and students in researching various aspects of social education, and it can also be said to be researching various aspects of Chinese society; encouraging students to organize various academic groups to increase their research interest, and at the same time, contacting experts outside the college to engage in collective research work. In the past year, the focus has been on the research of social education construction in China after the war. There are profound conclusions on the changes in Chinese society after the war, how social education should coordinate with these changes, and how to make social education lead the transformation of Chinese education. The two issues of "Education and Society" (the name of the college-edited publication, now in its fourth volume) to be published in the next issue of this year are reports on this research.

Main Affiliated Institutions

Here, I would like to add a point about the affiliated institutions of the college. The main ones are the National Education Experimental Zone, the Experimental Social Service Center, the Affiliated Middle School, and the Affiliated Social Education Normal School, etc.

Since the implementation of national education, supplementary education for out-of-school people has been officially included in the school system, in order to address the difficult problems and solutions that arise during implementation. The Experimental Social Service Center is a facility for social service in the experimental county unit.

Zhenning Road starts from the White House Funeral Home on West Zhongzheng Road, runs along Yuguang Village, crosses Yuyuan Road, then passes through Lane 668, and ends at Fanwangdu Road, with a total length of 840 meters. It was originally within the scope of the western Shanghai road system announced by the Shanghai Municipal Government in the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931).

### Circuit Inspection Group Proclamation: Enforcing Discipline; Hope That Citizens Will Name and Report Violations

The First Circuit Inspection Group for Wartime Discipline of the Military Commission, led by Group Leader Zhang Zhen and others, has recently arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, it issued a proclamation in various districts of the city, stating that since the July 7th Incident, the local area has been corrupt, and the people have suffered. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang's moral prestige has inspired and led the appropriate leadership, and the soldiers have worked hard to finally achieve victory. After the war, rehabilitation is needed, and the people's livelihood is difficult, and there is an urgent need to restore order and maintain security. Other post-war problems need to be solved urgently. The group has been ordered to enforce discipline and conduct circuit inspections in the designated areas. It will conduct practical investigations of its powers and responsibilities and will correct them at any time in order to achieve practical results. If there are any grievances or pains among the military and civilians, or if there are any opinions on local rehabilitation that can be improved, they should be submitted for review. All of them will be investigated immediately or adopted and forwarded for early implementation. If any military or police personnel violate discipline or criminals disrupt order, the public is especially requested to report them by name. Once verified, they will be severely punished in accordance with the law and will not be tolerated.

### Eliminate Opium and Drugs Within Two Years

The Municipal Government has recently consulted with the Ministry of Internal Affairs to eliminate opium and drugs throughout the country.

It is proposed to submit the "Post-War Measures for Eliminating Opium and Drugs" to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation. Local governments at all levels shall make the prohibition of opium and drugs the most important central task and strictly abide by and implement the post-war measures.

### Enemy Landing Craft Converted to City Ferry

The person in charge of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works stated: The city is extremely short of transportation tools in the Huangpu River, and a portion of it still relies on sampans and ferries. Two Japanese military landing craft previously received by the Navy General Headquarters have been transferred to Shanghai for ferry use.

It is said that the Shanghai Ferry Preparatory Office has designated a route to participate in the voyage to facilitate transportation.

### Zhang Xiaosong Discusses the Significance of Streamlining the Baojia System and Promoting the Spirit of Citizen Autonomy

[Report from this Newspaper] According to a statement by Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government, the streamlining of the Baojia system in this city began on the 15th of this month and has been underway for several days. In general, the situation is satisfactory, but a portion of citizens are reluctant to take office when appointed as Jia Chiefs or Bao Chiefs. He stated that during the enemy and puppet regime's occupation, virtuous or knowledgeable individuals avoided taking office because they disdained collaborating with the enemy. Now that the sun has shone again and the central government is promoting the Baojia system, the purpose is to

encourage citizen autonomy. This point became even more concrete after the central government promulgated the organizational guidelines for all levels below the county in the 28th year of the Republic (1939), implementing the new county system. Therefore, the Baojia system was incorporated into the autonomous organization. The past enemy and puppet regime's top-down joint liability and mutual guarantee system will now be thoroughly eradicated. Therefore, for all measures to prevent bandits, eliminate opium, repair bridges and roads, enrich art, etc., citizens must fully utilize the Baojia's grassroots mechanism, the Baomin (Protect the People) Assembly, and incorporate their opinions into the Baojia Covenant,

in order to refer to and implement them, fully promoting the spirit of citizen autonomy. He continued by saying that Shanghai has suffered under decades of concession control and eight years of enemy and puppet occupation. Citizens do not fully understand the actual situation of our country's politics. This streamlining of the Baojia system focuses on promoting the spirit of citizen autonomy, so he earnestly hopes that all citizens will take more responsibility for their own affairs and the affairs of the city.

### Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau Uncovers Japanese Hidden Supplies: White Coal, Watches, City Housing, and Large Quantities of Porcelain

[Report from this Newspaper] The investigation team of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui has recently uncovered a large batch of supplies hidden by the Japanese. These include over 500 tons of white coal, 111 city houses on Wusong Road owned by a Japanese real estate company, 290 valuable gold watches, 10 clocks, and a large quantity of porcelain worth over 210,000,000 in puppet currency. In addition, more supplies privately stored by Jiang Gongmei, the former commander of the Shanghai Gendarmerie, have been discovered. The details are listed below:

500 Tons of Coal Secretly Buried Underground

Currently, the team received a tip-off that a large amount of white coal was buried under vegetable fields in the center of the city in Jiangwan. They dispatched personnel to investigate and discovered approximately 500 tons of white coal buried within a vegetable field that previously occupied an area of about 110 cubic meters in the city center. It was discovered that the coal belonged to the Japanese company Aoyagi Yoko and was secretly buried underground when the Japanese surrendered. To avoid attention, it was still rented to nearby farmers to grow vegetables. For more than five months, the farmers were unaware that there was so much white coal buried underground.

Valuable Gold Watches, Hundreds of City Houses

It was also reported that valuable brand-name gold watches and 111 city houses along Wusong Road were hidden in a room on the second floor of the Hirata Watch Store on Wusong Road, all owned by the Japanese. After investigation, 290 gold watches and 10 large clocks were found in a specially made mechanism on the second floor of the Hirata Store. There were also countless imitation jade and diamonds. To show its seriousness, the team specially requested superiors to send personnel to supervise the inventory and transfer them to the Central Bank for safekeeping. The real estate was found to be assets of a Japanese real estate company, which were registered under the names of Chinese nationals to evade investigation. It has now been reported to the Handling Bureau for disposal.

Large Quantities of Porcelain Worth Tens of Millions

As for the porcelain, it was found in three private warehouses on Wusong Road, Broadway Road, and other locations. Its value is estimated to be over 210,000,000 in puppet currency (over 10,000,000 in legal currency).

Recovered Supplies Filled Twenty Trucks

Other supplies hidden by Jiang Gongmei, the former commander of the Shanghai Gendarmerie, have also been recovered, but are still under investigation and cannot be disclosed. In short, the supplies recently recovered by the team based on tips amount to about twenty trucks per day.

### Victory Ship to be Received Today, No Ceremony to be Held

[Report from this Newspaper] The Liberty ship originally scheduled to be received by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company the day before yesterday, named "Hai Su," was delayed due to a minor issue with the crew. The problem was resolved yesterday, and the first Victory ship (renamed "Hai Su") is scheduled to be received this morning. The company has agreed with the US Navy authorities to have US representatives visit the company at 7:00 AM this morning, accompanied by the entire crew, and take the prepared launch, "Guo Li," to complete the handover. It is reported that the procedure will be simple and no ceremony will be held. Also, the first batch of 36 Liberty ships' chief mates, second mates, engineers, and engine supervisors will visit each ship from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day starting today. If there are any questions, they can ask the crew on board at any time. The company issued certificates yesterday to facilitate boarding. Once everything is ready, the reception will proceed.

Shanghai-Tongzhou Ships Should Report for Duty Upriver

Ships are urgently needed for the recovery of the upper Yangtze River. Vessels plying the Shanghai-Tongzhou line, such as the "Jiang Ding," "Jiang Chang," and "Yuan Feng," have all been requisitioned and will soon be sailing upriver to report for duty. The Shanghai-Tongzhou line is suspended today, with only tugboats towing iron barges carrying cargo to Tiansheng Port, without passengers.

Coal Transport Vessels Still Severely Lacking

According to sources from the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee, the production of coal mines in North China has gradually increased and approximately 4,000 tons are shipped to Qinhuangdao every day. However, due to the lack of vessels, only two Liberty ships per week are shipping coal from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai, amounting to approximately 80,000 tons per month. As a result of the authorities' efforts, the output of the Huainan coal mine has also increased, producing approximately 1,000 tons per day. However, due to transportation vessel issues, only about 700 tons are shipped to Bengbu daily. Nanjing can only obtain 20,000 tons of Huai coal per month, which is insufficient, so it needs coal from Shanghai to supplement it.

### US Remittances to China Not Paid in US Dollars, Rumors of Hong Kong Dollars Converted to US Remittances are False

(Report from this Newspaper) Yesterday, a person in charge of an American bank in this city told a reporter from this newspaper: US remittances to China have been received slightly in the past ten days, but they are all in small amounts. The funds are all telegraphic transfers or mail transfers issued by the bank's Tianjin and Shanghai branches to New York on demand. As of now, the bank has not disbursed US dollars due to foreign exchange restrictions. Yesterday, newspapers in this city all published a special dispatch from the Central News Agency in New York stating that the US exchange rate was temporarily set at 25 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar. The person in charge of the bank told the reporter that the rumor was completely inconsistent with the facts.

### Temporary Buses Add Second Line, Connecting Nanshi and Zhabei

To facilitate citizens, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau launched a first circular route in the Nanshi area, where transportation was relatively difficult, on December 10 of last year. Now, a portion of the buses have been repaired, and a second route connecting Nanshi and Zhabei will be added starting from the 20th, starting from the Old North Gate, passing through Henan Road, and ending at the North Railway Station. In between, there will be stops for boarding and alighting at five locations: Zhongzheng Road, Fuzhou Road, Nanjing Road, Beijing Road, and Wusong Road. The fare will be divided into three types based on distance: 40, 50, and 60 national currency. The fare for the first circular route will also be adjusted to a uniform 50 national currency, regardless of distance, and will be implemented simultaneously starting from the 20th.

### Shangxian Hall Women's and Children's Hospital Suddenly Sealed Off

Because the hospital had difficulty finding a new location, it requested an extension, but the officer threatened to use force and dispatched several soldiers to "seal off" the entire building, prohibiting patients and doctors from entering or leaving. It is reported that the hospital has reported the incident to the responsible authorities in this city and requested protection.

### Wu Kaixian Flew to Chongqing Yesterday

He will stay in Chongqing for about a week and then return to Shanghai to take office.

### US Military Forms Military Police Auxiliary Squad

Because US military personnel in Shanghai sometimes cause trouble, the small number of US military police have difficulty maintaining order. Therefore, British and Russian expatriates in the area have been hired to form a military police auxiliary squad. The auxiliary squad has 590 members, divided into three teams, wearing US military uniforms with armbands bearing the letters "U.S." They cannot fully perform the same tasks as US military police, but when unexpected events involving US military personnel occur, they can perform guard duties, notify the US military police, and maintain order until the US military police arrive. These auxiliary military police are issued special passes by the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters. For the sake of caution, the US military has taken their fingerprints and photographs.

### Fuxing Nail Factory Owner Zhang Qipin Questioned Yesterday

[Report from this Newspaper] Zhang Qipin, owner of the Fuxing Nail Factory at Zhong'an Bridge, Route Paul Henry, Shanghai, manufactured nails for the enemy for military use during the war. After the victory, he was arrested by the police and transferred to the court. The case was heard yesterday morning at 10:00 AM in the Special Criminal Court of the High Court by Judge Cao Jun. The defendant stated that in May of last year, several Japanese from the enemy Jiangnan Shipyard came and forced him to manufacture nails. At the time, he refused by saying that the machines were damaged and there was a shortage of workers, but the Japanese were extremely brutal and beat the factory's accountant. They also said that the machines could be repaired, workers could be recruited, and raw materials would be supplied. Otherwise, the factory would be closed and the owner arrested. Therefore, he was forced to manufacture 240 barrels of nails with 250 dan of raw materials and 30,000,000 puppet currency supplied by the Japanese, with no profit. This was forced upon him, not voluntary. Subsequently, the factory's accounting shareholder Jin Lin and worker Zhang Changgou testified in court about the situation at the time. The court debate on the case is pending further investigation and will be adjourned for another hearing.

It is also reported that the case of the traitor Zhou Wenxian will continue to be heard at 8:00 AM today.

### Major Corruption Case at the Zhabei Police Branch

[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Shen Tianbao took the bench in the Fourth Criminal Court of the District Court to hear a major corruption case involving 17 people. Chen Xuenian, who took office as the director of the Zhabei Branch of the Shanghai Police Bureau on September 20 of last year, used his power in October to extort 300,000 from Zhang Lingen and Gong Dechang, the owners who were requesting the return of the land of the Japanese-owned Morita Brewery. Zhang and others then stole 3,000 feet of timber from the factory and sold it to Chen Xuenian, the owner of the Shouqi store at 154 Datong Road, for 6,000,000. Zhang delivered the money to Huang Jianxiong, the chief of the administrative section of the bureau, in several installments, who then transferred it to Chen Xuenian. Later, Chen and Zhang Liancheng, a patrol officer of the bureau, stole 340 steel bars from the Ya Steel Factory during an inspection, and the stolen goods were found at their residences. Subsequently, Zhu Shuyuan, a clerk of the bureau, discovered 550 dozen washbasins in the bureau's square in mid-October last year. Chen Xuenian

forged a document ordering Zhu Shuyuan and two clerks, Fang Xifan, to sell them. Through the introduction of Sha Tangzhou, they were sold to the Ya Jing Dian Porcelain Factory for 166,000,000. On the afternoon of the 17th of the same month, the bureau intercepted 4 tons of coal dust from the 52 Leather Factory that were intended as severance pay for workers. It was discovered that the remaining 16 tons were still in Panjiawan, so Zhang Liancheng ordered the Gonghexin Road Police Station to work with the Judicial Section to confiscate the coal. Later, Section Chief Wang Jianhe sent police officer Shi Xueliang

to transfer the coal, but its whereabouts are unknown. Prosecutor Huang Jianping then charged Chen Xuenian, Huang Jianxiong, and others with receiving bribes, stealing public property, and selling public property. After the defendants' lawyers presented their defenses, the court debated and scheduled the verdict for 2:00 PM on the 21st. The defendants Chen Xuenian, Huang Jianxiong, Zhu Shuyuan, and Fang Xifan were still remanded in custody and not allowed bail.

Party Headquarters Mediation, Opinions Approaching

Yesterday afternoon, more than a thousand workers from the company gathered in Fuxing Park to discuss countermeasures. At 2:00 PM, six representatives of the union were summoned to the Municipal Party Headquarters to discuss mediation methods with Wang Xianqing and Lu Keming. The company has agreed to issue a bonus of 10,000 to each employee, withhold wages for days of work slowdown, and subsidize 5,000. After Wang and Lu earnestly advised the labor representatives, they expressed their willingness to inform the workers. At 9:00 PM last night, the labor representatives convened a small group meeting to discuss. They have accepted the bonus item, but must require the management to pay the full amount of wages for the days of work slowdown. It was decided to convene a general meeting at the Lujiiawan New Car Factory at 7:30 this morning. If the workers pass the acceptance of the wage subsidy of 5,000 for the days of work slowdown during the general meeting, then work can resume at 9:00 AM this morning.

Reporting Case, Summoning Representatives

The District Court Prosecutor's Office has issued summonses to union representatives Zhu Junxin, Zhou Guoqiang, Yang Jingen, Zhang Renqing, Jiang Along, Cai Anqing, and Li Chuanqing to appear for investigation at 1:00 PM today in connection with the union's report against the company's managers Jukulai and Laidade for collaborating with the enemy. The union has collected evidence and prepared to submit it to the court, and has hired lawyer Sha Qianli as legal advisor to facilitate judicial procedures.

Tram Driver Suddenly Commits Suicide

Zhao Zhihai, a tram driver for the French Concession Tram Company from Beiping, suddenly returned home and ingested Lysol after the company cut off the power the day before yesterday. He was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but died at around 10:00 PM. According to reporters, Zhao was 48 years old and had worked for the French Concession for six years. He was usually loyal to his work and possessed a strong sense of patriotism. Seeing that the labor strike was prolonged and unresolved, and that the French disregarded everything and cut off the power, making it impossible for the trams to operate, which was bound to cause social unrest, he became disillusioned with life. It is said that Zhao's family was extremely poor, leaving behind an elderly mother, wife, and two young children. The union has decided on a consolation plan.

### American Pilot Who Bombed Tokyo Recounts Torture After Capture Captain Neilson Hosted the Press Yesterday

[Report from this Newspaper] Captain Neilson, a member of General Doolittle's command who was world-renowned for bombing Tokyo, hosted Chinese and foreign reporters from this city at 3:00 PM yesterday on the second floor of the Broadway Mansion to recount his experiences after being captured by the Japanese military following the first bombing of Tokyo on April 18, 1942.

Ran Out of Fuel on the Way Home, Forced to Land

Captain Neilson, 29 years old, arrived in Shanghai from the United States on the 13th of this month and plans to participate in the trial of Japanese war criminals who killed three American pilots here. Neilson suffered greatly at the hands of the Japanese and will be an important witness at that time.

On April 18, 1942, Neilson and 80 other American pilots, divided into sixteen B-25 aircraft, were ordered to bomb Tokyo. Neilson was on the 16th aircraft and departed from Korea last. On the way back, the aircraft ran out of gasoline and crashed near Ningbo. Neilson, along with pilot Homer and co-pilot Mita, were the only survivors. Three days later, they were captured by the Japanese army and sent to the Japanese gendarmerie for interrogation. In Tokyo, they met several pilots who survived from the 15th aircraft, which also landed due to lack of gasoline.

Imprisoned in Jail, Suffered Greatly

In June of that year, they were transferred to Shanghai and imprisoned in the Bridgehead Building as war criminals. In prison, they were subjected to inhumane treatment. For the first 40 days, they were not allowed to bathe. Later, the Japanese transferred all of them to the Jiangwan Military Prison, but pilot Homer could not go because he was seriously injured.

Subsequently, the Japanese held a military trial, but there was no translator and none of them could speak Japanese. On October 15, he saw Homer for the last time and heard that he and two others would be transferred to another concentration camp, after which he heard that they had been killed.

After the Japanese surrender, Neilson and his group were released in Beiping and rescued by the American rescue team and sent back to their home country. However, in Beiping, he heard the Japanese say that they had bombed Japanese churches, hospitals, and schools, but in fact, this propaganda was purely inconsistent with the facts. They only bombed Japanese arsenals, oil fields, etc. in the northern Tokyo Bay, and never used machine guns.

Lost Approximately Sixty Pounds in Weight

Neilson was imprisoned for a total of 40 months, losing 60 pounds in weight. After returning home, he recuperated and his mother prepared good food for him. Now he has regained 35 pounds. Neilson is still unmarried. Returning to Shanghai this time, he is fortunate to be able to move freely and act, which is very different from the past. He is here to participate in the trial and is determined to reveal all the facts to assist Colonel Heidelin and Captain Tao Ai in their work. Once the task is completed, he plans to return home and recuperate for a while. His fellow sufferer, Sergeant Dieshper, believes that Japan's war of aggression was entirely due to wrong education. The sergeant is now enrolled in a church school and is determined to go to Japan after graduation to improve a part of Japan's education from a church standpoint.

Japanese War Criminals Will Be Tried Soon

A total of seven Japanese are participating in the harm to American pilots this time, including two lieutenant generals, one colonel, and four captains. Currently, one captain is in Nanjing, one is in Singapore, and four are in Japan. Only one captain is in Shanghai, who is the one who executed the American pilots. As for the date of the trial, it will be held within the next two weeks.

### Incident at the Southern Theater in Nanshi Last Night; Three Soldiers Injured

[Report from this newspaper] At around 9 PM last night, a conflict occurred at the Southern Theater on the west side of the Penglai Market in Nanshi due to a dispute over smoking. The incident escalated into a shootout. As a result, soldiers Shao Ganpan and Xu Zhirong sustained gunshot wounds. In addition, Liu Shoumin, a traffic post soldier stationed near Xiaoximen, rushed to the scene upon hearing the commotion. However, after taking only a few steps, a soldier snatched his handgun and fired two shots, wounding Liu and causing him to fall to the ground. He was taken to the hospital for treatment. The bullet hit his abdomen, and his life is in critical condition. The details are currently being investigated by the relevant authorities.

### Property Tax Investigation and Valuation to Be Completed in Over a Year

[Report from this newspaper] This reporter has learned from the Finance Bureau that the collection of property taxes is based on the decision of the Housing Rental Management Committee. The valuation of ordinary residences is calculated at forty times the pre-war value. For productive properties such as apartments, hotels, and shops, the valuation is calculated at sixty times the pre-war value. A 14% tax is then levied on this valuation, with the landlord and tenant each bearing half of the burden. For rent collected this year, those with existing records will be taxed based on this increased valuation. However, for properties with lost records, staff must be dispatched to investigate and value them individually. The city is vast, with a total of 200,000 households. The investigation will take considerable time. Currently, only the areas of West Shanghai, the city center, and Ma Dang have completed the valuation and started collection. Although the valuation in other areas may be delayed, once the valuation is completed, taxes will be levied retroactively from the winter of last year. When asked when the entire valuation would be completed, the response was that it would likely take more than a year.

Land Registration Extended by Two Months

The Land Administration Bureau's handling of citywide land registration, originally scheduled for two months, has expired. To facilitate unregistered property owners, the bureau has decided to extend the deadline for another two months. Currently, an average of 500 people per district are registering in the three districts where registration has begun. To date, the registered land has reached 30% of the bureau's planned target.

### Pillars of the New China: The Youth Army Arrives in Shanghai, Regretting They Could Not Kill the Enemy with Their Own Hands

— By Our Reporter Suren

"If it were possible, I would really like to join your ranks," I said, shaking the strong hand of a Youth Army sergeant at parting. Our eyes met, and our hearts communicated. The scene: "The setting sun shines on the great flag, the horses neigh and the wind whistles." But this is not a time for soldiers to leave for the frontier, but a time for heroes to triumphantly return. The surging tide of the Huangpu River plays a welcoming song. On the deck of the "Hongda" ship, crowded with heroes wearing "Lion" armbands, are the pillars of the new China and the foundation of world peace. The national flag flutters on the mast, reflecting the setting sun, a scene of solemnity, magnificence, making one dare not look directly.

One Hundred Thousand Soldiers

I first went to Jiangwan Fudan University, the location of the 207th Division Headquarters of the Youth Expeditionary Force. Division Commander Luo Youlun was away on official business, and Education Director Liu Shaofeng, suffering from a cold, got out of bed to greet me. General Liu, a graduate of the seventh class of the military academy, had worked as a newspaper editor. He was short and wiry, but extremely amiable and approachable, and well-suited to be the director of a large group of young students. He narrated the whole story of the Youth Army, how they called on educated youth to join the army for the planned general counter-offensive, and how they began training in Kunming a year later. The two hundred first to two hundred ninth divisions, a hundred thousand strong, were just about to swear an oath and set out when Japan surrendered. He said that this was an irreparable regret. From the division commanders to every soldier, they all regretted not being able to kill the enemy with their own hands. But on the other hand, we should also be glad for the country, that it retained the elite of this army, preserving a greater share of the nation's vitality.

The entire division of over ten thousand men departed from Kunming on October 15 of last year. They traveled by road to Hankou, and then boarded ships to Shanghai. They spent many days in Hankou, and their footprints were left on the Han River and Dongting Lake. Hundreds of camps were lined up along the river. Several days ago, they were ordered to come to take over defense duties, and they began to hurry. So now there are two kinds of troops in the division headquarters. The Twenty-second Division of the New Sixth Army will not be able to fully depart until tomorrow morning. A regiment of the Youth Army arrived the day before yesterday, and another regiment arrived today. The newly arrived regiment can only be accommodated on the ship for one more night. The bright moon on the river may be more beautiful. Please, warriors, enjoy it.

Strict Discipline

Previously, some people had doubts about the discipline of students joining the army. Later, the actual performance was better day by day. At first, they may have had some young master habits, but now they do everything themselves. At first glance, you would think they were ordinary soldiers. You have to look carefully to feel that each one has the air of a scholar. Then you cannot help but be surprised by their arduous and extraordinary efforts.

After taking a few photos on the square, General Liu invited me to inspect the newly arrived troops at the dock. There, I met General Pang Zongyi, the commander of the 620th Regiment. General Pang was very imposing, but equally kind to people. After discussing it, they ordered all the soldiers not to go ashore, but to stay on the ship for another night. This work was quickly completed.

Full of Vigor

I stood on the deck watching them walk, talk, and transport things, and everyone was full of vigor. Look: The new China is beginning to grow. Who says that the quality of our army is low? Aren't these Youth Army soldiers better than average? May the country quickly move towards peace and unity, and in the future, all the troops will reach the same level. And may Shanghai be fortunate to have the protection of this army. All citizens will change their attitude towards soldiers, and educated youth will recognize the glory of joining the army. After they complete their officer training in a year, another group of young people will take over and lead them. At that time, the building of the army will be successful, and the safety of the country and the peace of the world will have a definite guarantee.

May the Youth Expeditionary Force improve day by day, and continue to be a model for the national army.

### Organizing Joke Material

— Wang Huanbai

There are many things that, although we look at them and feel they are not worth paying attention to, are actually the opposite. We should not ignore them. I believe that a person who takes a negligent attitude towards small things has little possibility of succeeding in great undertakings, so focusing on all kinds of trivial matters is not superfluous. The opinion I want to propose now—organizing joke material—is meant to do just that.

People have a motive for amusement, and laughter is a kind of action belonging to this motive. When people are happy, they cannot help but smile, which is the satisfaction of the amusement motive. We know that a person who spends the whole year with a stern face is painful to himself, even though others see him as serious. Only being able to laugh every day is the most meaningful thing in life. Therefore, someone's suggestion that one must laugh three times a day is truly a wise saying.

Since we already know that laughter has such a great effect on life, then why not seize the source of laughter, so that we can get laughing material anytime, anywhere? — Smart people have long thought of a way, which is to collect funny facts and then contribute them to others. In Hollywood, the American film capital, there is a library that specializes in collecting jokes, containing millions of joke books for people to read. In the American movies we see in Shanghai, there are often many interesting interjections that make people laugh. These materials are certainly not thought of by a few screenwriters and directors. Most of them can be said to come from that library.

There are many jokes that have been passed down from ancient China to today, but some of them are considered inferior and some contain allusions, so everyone looks down on them. Now, however, we welcome Western things. In fact, there is no lack of excellent content in Chinese jokes. Good ones can be said to be many, many. Why not compile them, print them out, and make them public?

Organizing joke material is a work that is beneficial to society at present. If there is an enthusiastic person willing to take on the task, they may as well first search for all the jokes, and then select those that are meaningful and interesting, and spend a little effort to revise them. I think it won't be too difficult.

### Effective Nursery Rhymes

— Du Yun

Speaking of nursery rhymes, they seem to have been around for a long time, and many are recorded in history books. We are not doing archeology, so we don't need to rehash old things. However, since the Republic of China, there have been several nursery rhymes that are worth mentioning.

In the autumn of 1926, Xia Chao was the Governor of Zhejiang Province. He was originally the Chief of the Provincial Capital Police Department. Sun Chuanfang drove out Lu Yongxiang and took over as the Governor, and Xia Chao was promoted as a result. At that time, there was a nursery rhyme: "The  returns, Xia Chao loses his head." In 1927, Sun Chuanfang became the Commander-in-Chief of the Five-Province Allied Army and sat in Nanjing. The Northern Expeditionary Army rose up and fought a major battle in Nanchang, and the Governor of Zhejiang was given to Lu Xiangting. In order to respond to the Northern Expedition, Xia Chao rejected the Allied Army in Jiaxing. Unfortunately, the arrangements were not complete, and he retreated to Hangzhou. Later, he was arrested and killed by Lu Xiangting. This  was not Lu Yongxiang, but Lu Xiangting. The nursery rhyme actually came true again. At that time, among the warlords, Wu Peifu was the most stubborn, and there was an early nursery rhyme popular among the people of Jiangnan: "One two three four five, overthrow Wu Peifu, six seven eight nine ten, welcome  Chiang Kai-shek." Sure enough, his prestige reached far and wide, and the warlords succumbed to his power. The nursery rhyme came true again. During the September 18th Incident, the Japanese invaders regarded our Northeast region as their lifeline and dared to invade and drive their troops straight in, and the Northeast fell as a result. However, the hearts of the people did not die, and there was a nursery rhyme at the time: "Talking about the Japanese, talking about the Japanese, the Japanese devils will not last long." After forcibly occupying it for fourteen years, they finally surrendered and returned the Northeast to us. The nursery rhyme became a reality. On August 13th, the Japanese invaders invaded and dreamed of annexing our country, wanting to regard themselves as the masters of the Greater East Asia, envying the Axis powers and igniting the Second World War. There was another nursery rhyme that circulated: "Overthrow the Japanese, kill the foreigners." There were even rumors that children who sang this nursery rhyme were brutally killed by the Japanese invaders by having water poured into them and their stomachs cut open, and their parents died with them. The nursery rhyme still came true. The Japanese invaders were indeed overthrown, and many foreigners died in the war and Nazi massacres. Recently, there is another nursery rhyme that is being circulated: "The Japanese are dead, Sun Yat-sen is alive again." What does this mean? It is thought that the first line has already come true, and the interpretation of the second line can be said to be the realization of the Prime Minister's legacy and the completion of the great cause of national construction. So, although the Prime Minister is dead, he is still alive, equal to being alive again.

In fact, the popularity and effectiveness of nursery rhymes is based on the psychology of the masses, not superstition. Because people have the same heart, whatever the heart thinks, it is spread by word of mouth, and everyone sings it with understanding, and everyone promotes its realization, so how can it not come true!

### I Teach University Students

— Shen Yi

Today, a recent university graduate came to our bank. It is said that he studied in the "Mechanical Engineering Department" of a certain famous university. I was shocked to hear this. For such a qualified, skilled, and university-trained professional to take on the work of a bank clerk, which only requires ordinary knowledge, it is too much of a waste of the knowledge he has gained from sixteen years of hard study, and it is also too much of a burial of his true talents that are needed by the country and can be fully applied.

Unfortunately, it is up to me, a junior employee who is not qualified to be a formal middle school student, to teach a university student about the receipt and payment and registration of various cash accounts. It seems a bit too much to elevate my status.

But I cannot disobey the orders of my superiors, so I can only temporarily "honorably" carry out this mission. What is strange is that this mission does not make me feel the slightest bit of pride. On the contrary, I have endless sympathy and admiration for his actions. We did not talk about any private matters except for official business. I saw his melancholy and silent face, as if it contained infinite inner pain, so just as my question was about to jump out of my throat, it was swallowed back by saliva. He carefully, cautiously, patiently, and diligently learned the various accounts that I taught him. This kind of spirit of re-learning made me feel a kind of inexplicable suffocation tormenting me.

When office hours were over, he packed up his things on his desk, politely said "See you tomorrow" to me, and left. I watched his back in a long cloth gown and felt lost.

From a colleague, I learned that his family is now in great difficulty. His father died last year, and his university course was completed with the help of several relatives. After graduating from university, I heard that he had also applied to a famous mechanical engineering plant, but because there were too many applicants and he did not have strong connections or guarantees, his true skills did not allow him to find a real place to work. So this time, he was introduced to our bank by a relative.

After listening to this, I deeply felt that in today's society, qualifications and talents are indeed a part of finding a job, but what is most needed are connections and introductions that are more useful than qualifications and talents. I feel sorry for this university student who "does not use what he has learned," but there are more university students who are wandering on the unemployment and starvation line after graduation. I want to shout: "Save the university students!"

### The Game of Life

— Yixin

Regard your life as a mischievous child participating in a very interesting game.

The rules of any game must be diligently learned and often practiced. Especially the game of life.

In the game, enthusiasm is needed to win. So life must have great enthusiasm.

Your attitude toward work is very important. Are you doing hard labor and hating your work? Or are you making work as lovable as a game?

A life of enjoyment or a life of drudgery, both are chosen by yourself.

Making yourself feel happy about work and life is as easy as making yourself hate them.

### Madison Square Garden in New York

— Huang Jiali

Located on Eighth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets in New York City is one of the world's most famous sports arenas: Madison Square Garden. The Garden celebrated its 20th anniversary of moving to midtown Manhattan in December of last year. One reason why this arena is so famous around the world is that outstanding athletic figures from all industries have showcased their skills there. For example, world skating queen Sonja Henie began her professional skating career in the Garden. World heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis held his title in the Garden five times. World-renowned long-distance runners, Finland's Nurmi, America's Cunningham, and Sweden's Hägg, have all competed on the Garden's 160-yard wooden track. Les Sett also demonstrated his invincible basketball skills in the Garden. Rogue Eddie had a brawl at the Garden during a lacrosse game. There are also those circus aerialists who perform acrobatics in the air, who have died on the spot due to carelessness while performing in the Garden.

Every year, many sports champions or championship teams are willing to perform in this fire-protected arena: such as the National Amateur Athletic Union's indoor track and field competition, the National Basketball Association's joint competition, the National Horse Show, the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, and the World Livestock Championship.

The boxing championships hosted by boxing promoter Jacobs have always been held at Madison Square Garden. Hollywood's skating competitions are held there every winter. The National Lacrosse Championship is performed in the Garden's skating rink. Several famous circuses perform there every spring for a month.

All tourists visiting New York are amazed that the Garden occupies 30 city blocks. The Garden is northwest of Madison Square.

The Garden began its history in 1857, when the first Federal Station was built near Madison Square Garden. In 1871, the railway authorities abandoned the location as the end of the railway, and the Federal Station was converted into an exhibition hall, named Gilmore's Garden, then renamed Barnum's Circus, and finally renamed Madison Square Garden in 1897. In 1890, a new house was built on that site.

At that time, Madison Square Garden was north of New York's entertainment center. The Garden's directors included banking tycoon Morgan and Barnum. Its architect, White, was shot and killed in his roof garden in 1906 by Shaw Harry. In 1896, Bryan accepted the Democratic National Convention's nomination as a presidential candidate in the Garden. At the 29th meeting of the People's Life Party's National Congress in 1924, the late U.S. President Roosevelt suddenly withdrew from the election and gave his votes to his old friend Smith, also there. It was the unprecedented and outstanding businessman Rickard who moved the Garden to its current address.

Science

### Powerful X-Rays

— Yu Songyao

Two or three years ago, the American General Electric Company created a massive X-ray machine called a "Betatron." The X-rays emitted by this machine were extremely powerful and dangerous. For safety, a three-foot-thick concrete wall was built around the machine. During the war, it was kept secret. It was not until mid-October of last year that the authorities slightly revealed some general information about the machine.

The "Betatron" is an electron accelerator, like a common AC transformer. Two coils made of one-inch thick copper bars surround a 130-ton electromagnet. A large amount of current passes through, making a buzzing sound.

Between the poles of the electromagnet, a bracelet-shaped glass vacuum tube with a diameter of 74 inches is placed. Inside the tube is a hot filament that emits electrons. The high voltage formed between the two poles of the electromagnet causes the electrons to circulate in a perfect circular orbit inside the tube. In one two-hundred-and-fortieth of a second, it rotates 250,000 times, which, measured in electrical units, is equal to 100 million volts.

After this, the current in the electromagnetic coil gradually decreases, and another magnet pulls the electrons out of the circular orbit. The electrons then spiral inward and strike a heavy target. X-rays are emitted from this.

These X-rays can penetrate thick steel plates, as if the steel were made of ice. It can also do other tricks. For example, a silver dollar, when slightly irradiated by it, becomes a very dangerous radioactive material. The X-rays knock neutrons out of the silver atoms. Some of the silver turns into [element missing], and another part turns into [element missing]. And the copper in the silver dollar turns into [element missing] atoms.

The controller for the "Betatron" is installed in another room.

### Abolish Recommendation Letters

— Yang Mou

In our country of morality, the effectiveness of recommendation letters is many times greater than lengthy resumes.

Moreover, recommendation letters not only affect the difficult first step of entering, but, to put it bluntly, will affect the end of continuous service in this organization. Despite performance evaluations and attendance records, those with strong backing always occupy an absolute advantage everywhere.

Victory has been five months ago now. The unreasonable phenomena that may have existed in the early days of victory should also be thoroughly reviewed, and the attitude of "correcting mistakes if we have them, and striving harder if we don't" should be adopted to achieve perfection. The practice of using only recommendation letters as the standard for appointing personnel should also be seriously investigated.

Those with recommendation letters ascend to high positions smoothly and happily, while those without them can only sigh and complain. Disregarding talent and only asking for recommendation letters is truly the most unfair thing in the world.

Abolish recommendation letter lobbying! Stop using official titles as rewards! Isn't it a pity not to use the examination system? Looking around, everything is waiting to be rebuilt, and looking far away, talent is scarce. In such a situation, if we don't thoroughly implement examinations and reward and promote talent, but only use recommendation letters as the standard, the obstruction to reconstruction work is self-evident.

### A Child's Revelation

— Zhang Chengjun

My seriously ill uncle finally passed away at 1:05 PM due to physical weakness and the ineffectiveness of medicine.

Because I was tired from a day's work, I visited him one last time in the evening. Seeing that his expression didn't seem to indicate imminent death, and my aunt also advised me to rest early so that I wouldn't be without energy at the office tomorrow, I returned to my room to sleep.

At midnight, the clock struck heavily, as if sending a signal urging my uncle to leave the world. A mouthful of phlegm welled up in his throat, blocking it. With a choking sound, he finally quietly departed from this world.

My aunt's cries woke me up.

My uncle was lying stiffly on the bed, never to open his eyes again to see everything around him, including his dearest wife and Chao'er. But Chao'er was woken up by his mother's cries and jumped up.

Chao'er is only six years old this year, and my uncle loved him the most. Since he was weaned, he had always slept with his father, not leaving him for a single night. Since my uncle fell ill two months ago, my aunt had moved Chao'er to sleep on another cot. But he often cried and clamored to sleep with his father.

"Daddy is sleeping. If you wake him up, he won't like you." Whenever Chao'er made a fuss, my aunt would coax him like this, and he seemed to understand this meaning. To win his father's favor, he would immediately stop his fuss.

Now, in the middle of the night, his own mother was crying and making noise. In Chao'er's eyes, this not only hindered his sweet sleep but also disturbed his beloved father's peaceful rest.

"Mommy, you always tell me not to wake Daddy when he's sleeping. Now that Daddy is sleeping so soundly, why are you crying and disturbing him, even waking me up?" Chao'er said in an innocent tone, while looking at his mother, fully expecting to receive his mother's praise and a satisfactory answer.

But the opposite was true. My aunt didn't even glance at him, but just sobbed.

Standing beside them, I was left between tears and laughter by Chao'er's expression. I received a valuable revelation: "Death is simply a long, deep sleep, what's so rare and sad about it?"

Although life and death are two extremes, they are so close. A person goes from infancy, childhood, youth, adulthood to old age, and then to death, as fleeting as the morning dew. If we view a father's death as a deep sleep, like Chao'er does, then what terror and sorrow do we have for death?

### Raising Education Loans: Charity Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Calligraphy and Painting

Displaying Rare and Valuable Ancient Paintings

The Shanghai Municipal Education Loan Committee will hold a charity sale exhibition of calligraphy and paintings at the China Painting Gallery on Chengdu Road for a week starting from the 23rd of this month to raise funds. The exhibition will display about 500 recent works by modern famous calligraphers and painters. Using a lottery method, one can obtain a masterpiece by a famous artist. The method is to first purchase a charity sale ticket, each ticket costing 5,000 yuan. Two days before the closing, tickets are used to draw numbers and claim the corresponding artwork. It is said that more than fifty Shanghai calligraphers and painters enthusiastically support this initiative, and their works are all carefully crafted masterpieces. Each piece is usually priced at over 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, but to spread good fortune, they are sold for only 5,000 yuan. Therefore, all charity sale tickets have been snapped up by people from all walks of life. A small number remains and is sold on behalf of the committee by the Social Services Department of this newspaper. Readers are requested to come and purchase them within four days, as the opportunity is rare and may be too late if delayed. In addition, the committee has recently received sponsorship from a collector in Shanghai, who has provided about 30 ancient paintings from various dynasties for display and exhibition. These are exceptionally precious and rarely seen. They will also be sold at marked prices, with the proceeds going to help students.
