### Foreign Minister Wang Reports to the Political Consultative Conference: Soviet Troops Will Be Completely Withdrawn by the End of April; Official Reply Received to Our Note

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, when attending the Political Consultative Conference this afternoon to give a foreign affairs report, stated: The Chinese government received on the 22nd a reply from Soviet Ambassador to China, Petrov, to the Chinese government's previous note of March 6th urging the immediate withdrawal of Soviet troops, which was

the official written reply. Petrov stated in the reply that Soviet troops are in the process of being withdrawn and declared that they will be completely withdrawn by the end of April at the latest. The government is currently considering a response to this reply.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] A second Changchun withdrawal, slightly different from the event of November 17th last year, is expected to be hastily completed tonight. However, personnel from the military delegation headed by Dong Yanping and personnel from the Changchun Municipal Government under Mayor Zhao Junmai are reportedly to remain stationed. The same applies to personnel from the various provincial governments that have been taken over, as their withdrawal would be interpreted by the Soviets as us voluntarily abandoning responsibility. The reasons for this withdrawal are that, on the one hand, the Soviets are posing as if they are about to informally withdraw, while on the other hand, they have notified Chinese officials that after the 23rd of this month, our air force personnel should immediately withdraw from the Changchun airport and are not allowed to continue using it. Thirdly, the Soviets are preventing us from transporting troops from Shenyang to Changchun via the Changchun Railway. Under these circumstances, if the Soviet troops suddenly withdraw from Changchun, it could become a "Siping Second." Therefore, officials are withdrawing unnecessary stationed personnel. Today is the last day of the Changchun withdrawal. The city of Beiping was filled with the rumbling of aircraft engines from dawn to dusk. The government seems to be using all available aircraft to transport back non-essential stationed personnel. In recent days, family members of the chairmen of various northeastern provinces stationed in Beiping have frequently petitioned the Northeast Headquarters to send them back to their husbands quickly, so as not to become another Zhang Xinfu. A public memorial service for Li Zhaolin will be held in Harbin on the 24th. The Communist army requested to participate. After negotiations, they decided to send 180 representatives into the city, but Mayor Yang is responsible for their safety. However, Yang's security team has already been disarmed by the Soviet army, as have the police. No one dares to predict what the situation will be at that time.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 23rd] Foreign Minister Wang stated at the Political Consultative Conference today that a written report on the negotiations with the Soviet Union regarding the Northeast issue will be submitted to the Conference. According to government sources, the scope of the Soviet troop withdrawal in the Northeast may not include Dalian, where the Soviet Union has stationed a large number of troops. In addition, the Sino-Soviet Treaty stipulates that Soviet troops are stationed in Lushun, which is also unlikely to be included in the withdrawal.

### Soviet Troops Continue to Withdraw from Changchun; A Batch of Our Receiving Personnel Returns to Jinzhou

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 22nd] Today, eight aircraft transported a large number of receiving personnel. However, on the other side of the fact of transporting receiving personnel is the continued withdrawal of Soviet troops, giving rise to rumors, soaring food prices (rice was less than ten yuan per catty at the beginning of the month, but is now selling for seventeen yuan), and public anxiety. This morning, this reporter accompanied receiving personnel who were taking a plane back to Jinzhou to the airport, which slightly relieved the boredom of being cooped up in the city for several months. The snow in the city had melted early, but the countryside was still covered in thick snow. This reporter witnessed several large buildings along the way that had previously been Soviet barracks, but are now desolate and dilapidated. When the truck approached the airport, there was a misunderstanding with the Allied guards on duty, who strictly inspected the personnel on board. After requesting the presence of a liaison officer, they were allowed to pass without hindrance. To date, there are still many receiving personnel in the Manchu Coal Building, but the previous four meals a day have been reduced to two, and the building is not as noisy as it used to be.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 23rd] Amidst the talk of Soviet troop withdrawal, there are currently several contradictory phenomena occurring. One of the most prominent of these phenomena is that the number of Soviet aircraft has increased in recent days compared to before.

[Central News Agency, Harbin, 22nd] The atmosphere in Harbin is still very tense. The city's perimeter is currently guarded by Soviet troops, who are prohibiting armed Communist forces from infiltrating the city. However, it is reported that as of the 21st, there were approximately 5,000 Communist troops who infiltrated the city.

[Associated Press, Shenyang, 23rd] Shenyang currently has a population of two million Chinese, Japanese, and Soviet residents. The area is now completely guarded by National troops. Shenyang Mayor Dong Wenqi recently ordered a door-to-door search, which may be the reason why the city is gradually becoming more peaceful. It is rumored that Communist troops are currently 30 to 90 li away from Shenyang and are retreating. National troops are advancing to the east, south, and north. According to Chinese military sources, Sun Liren's New First Army has arrived in Tieling and is advancing towards Siping Street. A portion of the National Army's 52nd Army has entered Fushun, and the New Sixth Army has also occupied Liaoyang.

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 23rd] In the plains area between Liaoyang and Yingkou, an unidentified armed force of nearly 100,000 has gathered in the past week. The leaders and cadres mostly speak Shandong and northern Jiangsu dialects. Most of the weapons they use are made in Japan and include a large number of mortars.

### Communist Army Demands Partially Accommodated; Jinpu Railway Repairs Continue; Eastern Section of Longhai Railway to Be Completed Soon

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 23rd] The issue of repairing the Jinpu Railway lines has been resolved. The Railway Bureau's repair team will dispatch personnel in the coming days to lead teams to damaged sections to continue repairs. It is reported that during the negotiations, the Communist army in the Shandong area demanded that the executive group recognize the Communist army's organized transportation agencies and district management. The group partially accommodated this request, allowing workers and technicians from the Communist army engaged in repairs during the repair period to be paid by the government. The rest is to be discussed later.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 22nd] Order in Tai'an is gradually stabilizing. People are able to trade freely. The National and Communist sides have agreed that no personnel are allowed to mix in. Although a small number of Eighth Route Army grain personnel carrying work permits and legal tender were found to be purchasing goods from the area, the overall situation is still good.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 23rd] The eastern section of the Longhai Railway is being actively repaired. On the 22nd, repairs reached the 86-kilometer mark at Daxujia and Bayi Group. In addition to this, the most severely damaged section east of Xuzhou is still 5 kilometers long. Beyond this 5 kilometers, the damage to the railway line is lighter. The tracks from the Yunhe Station to Baitabu, a distance of 94 kilometers, are still in good condition. Only the 237 kilometers between Baitabu and Hetu need to be repaired. The Railway Bureau had planned to start repairs westward from Haizhou, but was rejected by the Communist army. The eastern section of the Longhai Railway from Xuzhou to Lianyungang is 223 kilometers long, of which 78 kilometers were damaged. 20 kilometers have now been repaired, and the remaining 58 kilometers can be completed in the short term if there are no obstacles. The northern section of the Jinpu Railway has now been repaired to 621 kilometers north of Hanzhuang, and is still 19 kilometers from Lincheng. The 24th Transportation Group is still supervising repairs in Hanzhuang.

### Communist Army Establishes Checkpoints in Various Parts of Jiaodong to Forcibly Collect Illegal Taxes

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 22nd] Qingdao News: The Communist army in various parts of Jiaodong has arbitrarily renamed Jimo County to Jixi County and divided Yashi County into Yaqian County, Yahou County, and Wulong County, appointing local officials and undermining the unity of government orders. The Communist army has also set up checkpoints on major transportation routes to forcibly collect donations and taxes, placing the people in dire straits. In Shandong Province, which is occupied by the Communist army, approximately 85% of the people are displaced and young people have lost their homes and schools, forming the most serious problem in Shandong Province today. According to related estimates, over 60% of middle school students have dropped out of school, and over 80% of elementary school students have dropped out of school. There are only 51 middle schools currently open in Shandong Province, and Jinan City accounts for two-thirds of them.

### Delegation to the Northeast Has Not Yet Reached an Agreement

Zhang Zhizhong Postpones Trip to Dihua

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] Regarding the dispatch of a military mediation executive group to the Northeast, the Military Tripartite Group meeting passed the principles on the eve of General Marshall's return to the United States on the 11th of this month. However, the specific plans and practical methods for implementation after arriving in the Northeast still need to be agreed upon. It was originally planned that there would be results before the 20th of this month, so that Zhang Zhizhong could fly from Chongqing to Dihua on the 21st. However, regarding the issue of sending an executive group to the Northeast, after many meetings and individual discussions between Zhang and CCP representative Zhou Enlai and General Gillem, no agreement had been reached by the 20th. Zhou flew to Yan'an on the 21st to ask for instructions. Minister Zhang had to postpone his trip to Dihua for a few days to wait for Zhou to return to Chongqing and continue the meeting, hoping to reach an agreement.

### A Student in Tai'an Shot and Killed by Communist Army

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 23rd] A tragic case of a Communist army shooting and killing a student recently occurred in Tai'an. On the 10th of this month, Fan Weishun, a student at Tai'an Yuying Middle School, was on his way home from school when he passed a Communist army post at the station. The Communist army asked for the password, and he replied that he was a Yuying student. The guard immediately opened fire, and the student fell to the ground with a serious injury to his right arm. His entire arm was swollen and purple. He was transported to Jinan by special car by Lieutenant Colonel Nepp of the Tai'an Group for treatment, but died on the 20th. Those who heard about this atrocity of the Communist army were all outraged.

### Yunnan Provincial Provisional Council Suggests Issuing Railway Bonds

[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 22nd] In order to propose the restoration of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the Yunnan Provincial Provisional Council today suggested that the Yunnan Provincial Government request the Central Government to preside over the issuance of 400 million yuan in railway bonds. Of this amount, the Yunnan Provincial People's Enterprise Company would initially purchase 200 million yuan, all sectors of society in the province would jointly raise 100 million yuan, and other provinces would be asked to subsidize the raising of 100 million yuan. The Central Government is requested to formulate the regulations for the bonds.

Once everything is in place, aircraft will be sent to survey the area.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, [Missing date] 23rd] On the morning of the 22nd, the questioning of President Song at the Political Consultative Conference reached its climax. Compared to the questioning of former President Kong by previous Political Consultative Conferences, the atmosphere of anger and enthusiasm at the venue was even more intense. Compared to the questioning of Song at the Second Plenary Session, the sounds of the cannons this time were enough to drown it out. Huang Yuren, after hearing President Song's political report, said that the current political phenomenon suffers from two diseases: one is pushing, the other is falsifying, and the third is chaos. I wonder if President Song also admits to these two diseases? Zhu Huijing criticized the government's gold policy, saying that this is fraud, betrayal, and deceiving the people. Some people also said that everyone had high hopes when President Song came to power, but now everyone is disappointed. Hu Qiuyuan said, it's not just disappointment, despair is not far away.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] The Political Consultative Conference held its fifth meeting at 8:20 AM today, with government representatives Shao Lizi and Zhang Qun respectively reporting on (1) the progress of the Political Consultative Conference and (2) the cessation of military conflict, resumption of transportation, army reorganization, and unified organization of the Communist army plan. The addition of these two special reports to this general assembly is quite unique. The meeting was chaired by Ms. Wu Yifang, with 158 councilors attending. The number of people listening in suddenly increased today. The General Assembly Secretariat issued 30 listener passes yesterday. Gu Weijun and Wu Tiecheng both attended the meeting. After the chairman announced the opening of the meeting and the secretariat reported, Shao Lizi spoke first and reported on the Political Consultative Conference. It was originally planned that Sun Ke Zu would give this report, but today Sun was in Beibei on official business, so Shao attended instead. Shao has spared no effort to promote domestic unity and the Political Consultative Conference, and is therefore extremely familiar with the progress of the Political Consultative Conference. He briefly explained (1) before the Political Consultative Conference (i.e., the reasons for convening the Political Consultative Conference), (2) the progress of the meeting, and (3) the situation after the Political Consultative Conference. After the speech, Zhang Qun reported on the cessation of military conflict, resumption of transportation, army reorganization, and unified organization of the Communist army plan, describing the three negotiation processes separately, and specially pointed out that the government has always negotiated with the Communist army in the spirit of national forbearance, in order to realize peaceful unification as much as possible, so that the people can recuperate and the country can engage in peaceful construction. The report ended at 10:30 AM. After a ten-minute break, the meeting continued with written and oral inquiries, totaling 51. Councilors all expressed great concern about the degree to which the Political Consultative Conference's resolutions and the restoration of transportation and reorganization of the army have been implemented, and listed facts of the Communist army disregarding cease-fire orders and wantonly harassing the people, offering many impassioned statements. Finally, Shao Lizi gave simple answers to questions about the legal status, representation, and guarantees of implementation of the Political Consultative Conference. The General Assembly also passed the temporary motion of Councilors Yin Shuxian and others, requesting the establishment of a special review committee to review the two reports of this meeting. The meeting adjourned at 1:30 PM.

[United Press, Chongqing, 23rd] Shao Lizi, in his report to the National Political Consultative Conference on the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, stated that the government is determined to implement them all. Zhang Qun, in discussing the cessation of conflict agreement, stated that the government would make extreme concessions to achieve peace and unity. He stated that General Marshall's original purpose in coming to China was to assist China in fulfilling its obligations to the United Nations and to promote Sino-US cooperation in the work of repatriating Japanese residents, but due to changes in the situation, Marshall had to deal with domestic issues in addition to resolving China's diplomatic issues. Zhang also stated that when the current US Ambassador to China, Hurley, was in office, his original suggestion for the nationalization of the army was that the ratio of Kuomintang and Communist armies was 7 to 1. The Communist army requested a ratio of 6 to 1, and the final agreement reached was a ratio of 5 to 1. Zhang revealed that the resolution on the nationalization of the army was established after seven meetings. This agreement was based entirely on Marshall's recommendations, not on the recommendations of either the Kuomintang or the Communist army.

Minister of Propaganda Wu Guozhen stated that the Chinese government fully agrees with Marshal Stalin's remarks. Everyone wants peace, and no one welcomes war.

Thomas said that people all over the world will welcome Stalin's statement. Thomas believes that Stalin's statement will ease the tense atmosphere surrounding the Iranian issue at the Security Council meeting to be held in New York next Monday. Chairman Bloom of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said that Stalin's statement was comforting. House Speaker Rayburn called Stalin's statement a "powerful statement." Other senators and representatives all believed that Stalin's statement was enough to ease world tensions and was a prelude to the success of the Security Council meeting.

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said: I am very satisfied with Stalin's words and even more pleased to hear that he has no military ambitions.

He said: On the eve of the submission of the Iranian incident to the Security Council for discussion, Stalin's forceful statement that "the UN organization is based on the equality of rights of all countries and not on the principle of controlling other countries" is of great significance. Mr. Ala further hoped that Stalin's stated policies and principles could be applied to Soviet-Iranian relations and indicated that Stalin's remarks were timely and promising.

Testimony of Soviet Embassy Telegraph Operator

[Reuters, Toronto, 23rd dispatch] Igor Gouzenko, a cipher clerk at the Soviet Embassy in Canada, testified in court yesterday in the case of Canadian Member of Parliament Ross Kane for supplying secret information to the Soviet Union, admitting that the Soviet security police are active in Canada. He said that he followed Colonel Zabotin and Colonel Ramonov, Soviet military attachés to Canada in 1943. Zabotin set up a military attaché office. The Soviet Union has its own intelligence system in Canada, searching for information beneficial to the Soviet Union.

### Rectifying the Term "Minority Nationalities" and Discussing China's Border Issues

— Zhang Qiyun

The term "minority nationalities" did not originally exist in China. It is a translation from Western languages. The author is not very clear about who used this term first. After World War I, Dr. Bowman, an authority on political geography in the United States, wrote a book entitled "The New World After the War" (I. Bowman: New World, published in 1921), which was translated into Chinese by the author and friends and published by the Commercial Press. We once translated the English word "Minority" as "minority nationalities." Scholars in China seem to have failed to examine the similarities and differences carefully, often using the term "minority nationalities" as a general term for the various ethnic groups in our border regions, turning it into a very common term. In fact, the national conditions of China and foreign countries are very different. We should be cautious about all terms, carefully examining their meaning and reality. If we adopt them casually, various difficulties will inevitably arise.

What is meant by "minority nationalities"? Let's take an example first. Czechoslovakia is a country in Central Europe with a population of over 14 million, of which 2 million are of German ethnicity. These Germans share the same language and culture as the 70 million Germans, and due to language, religion, and historical ties, they have a strong emotional connection to Germany, implicitly recognizing Germany as their homeland. Therefore, the Germans within Czechoslovakia are referred to as "minority nationalities" not only in relation to Czechoslovakia but also in relation to Germany. The difference between Europe and China is that China has been a unified country since the Qin and Han dynasties, while Europe has not been unified since the decline of Rome. It is like the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods in China, with various powers vying for dominance, the map changing colors, and the ethnic boundaries and national borders not coinciding. This situation is particularly evident in Eastern Europe. Therefore, the issue of minority nationalities is a very serious political problem in Europe. Scholars call it a "conflict zone," and if not handled properly, it can lead to internal strife and external aggression. After World War I, the League of Nations advocated the conclusion of minority treaties, with each relevant country guaranteeing their implementation, precisely because of this.

China's situation is completely different. The territory of the Chinese nation and the geographical distribution of the Chinese nation are largely consistent. China is adjacent to the Soviet Union and India, but there are no areas in China where Slavs and Indians are mixed. Therefore, the term "minority nationalities" cannot be applied in China. The Chinese nation is a large family, with the Han nationality being like the eldest son, and the Manchu, Hui, Tibetan, and other ethnic groups being like brothers and sisters. Over the past two thousand years, there have been countless migrations, mixtures, and intermarriages. Although the languages, beliefs, lifestyles, and customs of the various ethnic groups are different, there is no strict distinction in bloodlines. For example, the Manchus are also known as the Banner People. We know that the Banner People in the early Qing Dynasty included the Han Army Banners and the Mongolian Banners. Even the Manchus themselves have undergone numerous migrations, incorporating various components of the Bohai, Khitan, Jurchen, Goryeo, and Han people of Liaodong in the Ming Dynasty. Where is there a so-called pure Jurchen descendant? The same can be said of other ethnic groups such as the Mongols, Hui, and Tibetans, as well as their various branches. Anyone who has read Chinese history should have the same feeling.

What forces ultimately shape a nation? Language is not the main factor. For example, part of Canada speaks English and part speaks French, without harming its status as a thriving nation. Religion is not the main factor either. For example, northern Belgium, near the Netherlands, adheres to Protestantism, while southern Belgium, near France, adheres to Catholicism. Lifestyles and customs are even less important. As the ancients said, "Different customs prevail in broad valleys and great rivers, and different customs exist among those who live there." The larger the territory, the more complex its economic situation. The main forces that shape a nation are nothing other than a common history, common memories, common commemorations, and a common spirit. For example, the United States can be called a new Europe. Immigrants from various European countries are present. In Europe, their ancestors were originally hostile to each other, but upon reaching the New World, their descendants are able to unite sincerely. This is due to the American spirit permeating the country. The origin of the American spirit lies in the common memories of the War of Independence, the Civil War, and the two World Wars, as well as the common commemoration of great figures such as Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Wilson. Therefore, the establishment of a nation is not only due to geography but also due to history. The History of Yuan is a part of Chinese official history. Genghis Khan is not only a great figure of the Mongol ethnicity but also a national hero of the entire Chinese nation. Tsongkhapa is also owned by the entire nation.

The history of the Chinese nation is a history of joys and sorrows, sharing weal and woe. The Han, Manchu, Mongol, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups are like the five fingers of a hand, with the blood of the Chinese nation flowing together. The Han ethnicity can be compared to the thumb, the historical center of activity. If we have internal problems, that is a matter for our family, and we can discuss and resolve them ourselves without waiting for others to step in and help. If one finger is cut off by external force, the entire hand will suffer and bleed continuously. This is called national consciousness and the great cause of unity. Scholars in ancient times often used the term "border barbarians" to refer to several branches of our nation. In modern terms, it means several groups of descendants living in the border areas. This is originally a very correct concept. Therefore, we should follow the old saying and call them "border ethnic groups" or simply "border people." The term "minority nationalities" originated from abroad and is fundamentally unacceptable.

Understanding this principle, we know that the word "minority nationalities" should absolutely not be included in the Constitution. Even if we take a step back and stipulate special treatment for border ethnic groups in the Constitution, thereby losing the generosity of treating everyone equally, it is also completely unnecessary. The Constitution is different from general laws. The Constitution should focus on the national ideology and the political system created based on that ideology. As for general policies, they often need to be adapted to the times and local conditions, and it is enough to stipulate them in ordinary laws. For example, coastal residents make a living by fishing. The Constitution does not need to establish a separate article to protect coastal fishing grounds. The dialects in Fujian and Guangdong are diverse, including Fuzhou dialect, Guangzhou dialect, and the like. The Constitution cannot have explicit provisions to maintain such dialects. The situation is the same for the sea borders and the continental borders. The author believes that there should be no discrimination between the herders of the Central Asian plateau and the coastal fishermen, and there is no significant difference between the languages of the Mongol and Tibetan ethnic groups and the dialects of Fujian and Guangdong. As for religious freedom, it is the inherent right of citizens, and the various ethnic groups in the border areas are no exception.

Based on this, the policies that should be implemented for the various ethnic groups in the border areas in the future are clear and beyond doubt. Nationalism must not be abandoned. We currently do not see any better organization than the nation-state as a unit of the new world. The responsibility of politicians is to create centripetal force for the country, not to ask them to go against the grain and create centrifugal force for the country. Local dialects should not be prohibited, nor can they be prohibited, but the national language and the country's history and geography are essential for every citizen to learn. The livelihoods of the various ethnic groups in the border areas still largely rely on nomadic life or a semi-agricultural, semi-pastoral state. This is certainly due to the influence of the geographical environment, but production methods and transportation conditions are also important. As a result, their standard of living is far lower than that of the southeastern coastal areas. There is no reason to let them suffer hardship without improving their situation. "Using industry to promote agriculture (including forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries) and using agriculture to support industry" should be universally implemented throughout the country. As for local autonomy, it is a major principle for establishing a country, but the border areas cannot have so-called high degree of autonomy, which is different from the provinces in the interior. The United States wants to turn Alaska into a new province. The United States originally had forty-eight provinces, and thereafter there will be forty-nine provinces. This is the principle. The Founding Father said that all ethnic groups in the country are equal. This is truly a guiding principle for nation-building. Since all are equal, there is no need for special treatment other than adapting to the environment.

The author absolutely dares not ignore the interests of the border people, nor does he shy away from the fact that there have been civil uprisings in the border areas in the past. Several rebellions in the Qing Dynasty once made the northwestern provinces restless. However, the government's handling policy should be no different from dealing with civil uprisings in the interior. Zuo Zongtang's saying, "Distinguish between the good and the bad, regardless of Han or Hui," is sufficient to illustrate the traditional spirit of the Chinese nation. Strengthening the centripetal force of the border people lies in eliminating corruption, improving officialdom, and regarding the careful selection of county magistrates and the renewal of county administration as the true foundation for nation-building. This is also a national reform, not limited to the border areas. In short, the border issues of China today are fraught with crises. The reason for this is not from within but from external erosion. The Xinjiang issue and the Mongolian issue, which are enough to shake the foundation of the country, did not occur during the Anti-Japanese War but after the restoration of peace. The reason for this is highly noteworthy. Conversely, if China and India can coexist peacefully, Tibet will certainly be safe. In the 33rd year of the Republic of China, Commander Huang Zhengqing of Labrang Monastery represented the Tibetan compatriots in Chongqing and donated funds to purchase 30 aircraft. Is this not clear evidence of the Tibetan people's inclination towards the interior? Knowing that China's border issues are not internal but external, we must recognize the facts, distinguish right from wrong, and first have a nationally consistent public opinion. Then the government's diplomatic negotiations can have a firm and unwavering position.

Furthermore, the League of Nations' treaty to protect minority nationalities is based on President Wilson's principle of national self-determination. It sounds very appealing on the surface, but in reality, it is inevitable that many difficulties will arise. Within a country, the division between minority nationalities is just as the ancients said, "Those who are not of our race will surely have different hearts." Having divided a piece of land to be ruled by a certain country, there are also treaties to protect the people of that place, resulting in various restrictions on the implementation of the country's policies. These minority nationalities are neither completely nationals nor completely foreigners. The people are constantly harboring different ambitions, and the government is often at a loss. The issue of minority nationalities is one of the important factors that led to World War II. Therefore, scholars have often criticized the improper application of President Wilson's principle of national self-determination. As for the plebiscites held under the occupation of foreign troops, forcibly digging them out of the embrace of the motherland and glorifying it as national self-determination, how is this any different from a treaty signed under duress? The author is unwilling to say more.

Someone may ask, "Is it true that China has no minority nationalities problem?" The answer is, it seems there is. That is, the Korean farmers scattered in the Northeast, whose number is close to a million, referred to simply as the Korean farmer problem. The seriousness of the situation has exceeded the ordinary foreign resident problem and is somewhat similar to the minority nationalities problem. Since Korea gained independence and seceded from China, it has suffered various oppressions from Japan. A portion of the farmers crossed the border to migrate and cultivate land and plant rice in our Liaoning and Jilin provinces, which is to be pitied. However, Japan used the Korean farmers as its vanguard for aggression. They often did not accept the rule of local county governments but were directed by the Japanese consulates. Chinese farmers were sometimes bullied by the Korean farmers. In the Yanbian area of Jilin (the so-called Gando by the Japanese), a situation of the guest surpassing the host was created, which is very heartbreaking. Before the September 18th Incident, the Northeast was the most troublesome place in China's diplomacy. Immediately before the Shenyang Incident, there was the Wanbaoshan Incident, which was caused by Korean farmers in the countryside of Changchun hindering water conservancy and clashing with Chinese farmers. At the same time, Japan incited anti-Chinese sentiment in Korea. At that time, the author went to Changchun, Wanbaoshan, and Sinuiju in Korea to conduct on-the-spot investigations and deeply felt the seriousness of the situation. The air was depressing, with the feeling that a storm was about to break. I had just returned to Nanjing for a month when the Shenyang Incident suddenly broke out. Czechoslovakia became the trigger for the European side of World War II because of the minority nationalities problem. In this regard, there is a similar situation in the Far East. This time, the Czechs, having regained their homeland, learned from their pain and advocated expelling the two million Germans within the country because they had taken actions that endangered the motherland during the war and felt that this was the only way to deal with minority nationalities. The Chinese nation has always been compassionate, merciful, and magnanimous. For the Korean farmers in the Northeast, we should negotiate with the Korean government, allowing those who wish to move back to Korea to do so and those who wish to naturalize to do so. We should treat them equally with other foreign residents, but there is no fundamental discussion of self-governance for minority nationalities.

Zuo Zongtang once said, "Protecting Xinjiang protects Mongolia." The principle of lips being cold when the teeth are lost is an eternal truth. If Mongolia is not protected, then the Northeast is also in danger. If Xinjiang and Mongolia are lost one after another, the Great Wall area will immediately become a border fortress, and the provinces in the Central Plains will have no peaceful days. The disaster of national subjugation is imminent. The so-called territorial integrity and sovereign independence should include the entire Republic of China. How can we call it integrity if our mountains and rivers are broken? Whether Mongol, Hui, or Tibetan, they are all Chinese, part of the 400 million compatriots. They are definitely not Slavs or Indians within China. The ancients once said, "One word can ruin a country." The author sincerely hopes that the term "minority nationalities" will no longer be heard in the council chambers or seen in newspapers. Moreover, in the future, public opinion organs should issue a declaration on the border issue, righteously and forcefully announcing it to the world, so that foreigners will no longer be able to distort the facts and have an excuse. This is truly the supreme blessing of the country and the infinite fortune of the nation.

Changshu

Request to Establish a Fishing Salt Yard

The fishing season is approaching this year. The County Fishermen's Association has recently petitioned the Ministry of Finance to establish a fishing salt yard in Hupu Port to facilitate transportation and sales. Hupu Port is a place for the transportation and sale of saltwater fisheries. Every year during the spring and summer, fishing boats export to the Yellow Sea to fish. There is no place to replenish fishing salt along the way, which affects production. Before the war, approval was granted to establish a salt yard, but the war broke out, and it was not established.

Suzhou

Bengbu

Thorough Handling of Enemy and Puppet Assets

In the past, the agencies in charge of handling enemy and puppet assets here were all temporary in nature, resulting in many enemy and puppet materials, real estate, and disputes arising from the forced purchase of property by traitors at low prices not being handled clearly. In order to unify the handling, the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regions has established a Resident Office in Jiangsu and Anhui, with special responsibility. Xu Guozhan, Director of the Bengbu Branch, and Li Jiaji, a specialist assigned by the Bureau, arrived in Bengbu from Shanghai last week and have been visiting local authorities to survey the site and prepare to establish the Bengbu Branch. It will be formally established within days to thoroughly handle enemy and traitor properties in the city.

Songjiang

Details of the Exhumation of Buried Foreign Nationals

Regarding the tragedy of the enemy military police stationed in Songjiang burying foreign nationals alive, General Commander He of the Army was reported and ordered an investigation. The Songjiang Prosecutor's Office exhumed a skeleton. It is now known that the live burial of the victimized foreign nationals took place in the winter of the 32nd year (of the Republic of China), when the enemy military police stationed in Songjiang and the enemy garrison used rickshaws to transport them to Fangta Square, where they dug a pool and buried them alive. When the foreign nationals were escorted, enemy troops guarded the area, not allowing the public to watch. However, upon passing by, it was seen that those being escorted all had blue eyes and blond hair, clearly not domestic people. As for the nationality of these foreign nationals and why they were arrested and harmed, it is difficult to ascertain. The skeleton exhumed on the afternoon of the 21st had the left hand and five fingers incomplete, and the teeth were scattered in the mud, caused by being buried and then suppressed with huge rocks. The exhumation was scheduled to continue on the 22nd, but it was temporarily suspended due to rain. The nationality of the victimized foreign nationals will have to wait until the excavation is completed before identification.

### The Enemy and Puppet Industry Management Bureau Temporarily Unable to Conclude Operations: Shanghai Section Until February 20th - Received Materials Exceeding 10 Billion [Units of Currency] - Military Supplies, Illicit Gains, and Undecided Materials Not Included

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Enemy and Puppet Industry Management Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui has been established for nearly five months. The actual value of the materials received has garnered considerable attention from various sectors. Yesterday, this reporter received information from Mr. Shen Shanhong, Secretary of the Bureau, regarding these figures for the Shanghai section up to February 20th of this year. However, the materials from locations outside Shanghai have not been completely tallied and thus cannot be released. The breakdown of these figures is as follows:

(1) Materials (including warehoused goods, seized goods, German merchant company assets, trading company assets, and pharmaceuticals, etc.): 298.3 billion [Units of Currency]; (2) Factories (including factory buildings): 154.6 billion [Units of Currency]; (3) Real estate and furniture: 58.3 billion [Units of Currency]; (4) Docks and warehouses: 33.8 billion [Units of Currency]; (5) Gold, silver, currency, and securities: 30.4 billion [Units of Currency]; (6) Educational and cultural institutions: 11.7 billion [Units of Currency]; (7) Ships: 9.3 billion [Units of Currency]; (8) Farms and fisheries: 4.6 billion [Units of Currency]; (9) Food and perishable goods: 2.6 billion [Units of Currency]; (10) Fuel: 1.1 billion [Units of Currency]; (11) Military vehicles: 2 billion [Units of Currency].

The total sum above is over 600.7 billion [Units of Currency]. This valuation is based on Shanghai market prices as of the end of December of the 34th year [1945]. If estimated at current market prices, it would be over 1 trillion [Units of Currency]. Furthermore, all military supplies, illicit gains, and suspected materials for which a verdict has not been reached are not included.

Disposition of Traitor Property

Regarding the disposition of traitor property after their death, according to the original order from the Executive Yuan, it could be confiscated. However, a recent order from the Judicial Yuan states that it cannot be confiscated. Therefore, the Bureau has telegraphed the Executive Yuan, Judicial Yuan, and Legislative Yuan, requesting a joint determination of a method. Furthermore, whether the children of traitors can inherit this property is also not clearly stipulated. Therefore, current laws seem insufficient. Once new methods are decided, this can be resolved. The Bureau is currently conducting investigations into this property, followed by receiving and inventorying it. The Bureau is responsible for or entrusts its safekeeping but will not handle it for now. For example, the children of suspected traitors can still reside in their former residences. The Bureau will only handle it after the court makes a definite ruling.

Liquidation Accounts Extremely Cumbersome

At the beginning of the Bureau's establishment, the Executive Yuan originally instructed that the disposal of enemy and puppet property should be completed within three months. However, due to practical difficulties, an extension was granted. Therefore, it has been nearly five months. Observing the current situation, matters regarding property disputes and material disposal should conclude within three months. However, the handling of illicit gains must await court judgments, and it is feared that the court's trials of traitors will still take considerable time. Furthermore, regarding the liquidation section, the accounts are extremely cumbersome and time-consuming. Therefore, although the Bureau has gradually reduced its scope and dismissed some employees, it is expected that the illicit gains and liquidation sections cannot be concluded soon.

Restructured Into Three Groups

Currently, the Bureau's internal organization, after restructuring last month, is divided into thirteen groups: The first group is responsible for handling and utilizing various materials, including houses, factories, warehouses, and the sale of affordable goods, etc. Currently, for houses that the Bureau has decided to dispose of, the Bureau affixes a seal and hands them over to the Central Trust Bureau for safekeeping. Whether the furniture inside the house is sold is also determined by the Trust Bureau. The second group is responsible for evaluation and appraisal. The third group is responsible for handling property disputes. The Bureau's deliberative body, the Real Estate Utilization Committee, holds a meeting once a week. Many institutions request the Bureau to allocate houses, which are then decided by this committee.

Returning Automobiles Based on Numbers

Because Western newspapers have criticized the matter of returning automobiles, this reporter specifically inquired with Mr. Shen. According to his response, within eight years, Shanghai residents lost 2,000 automobiles, and the Bureau has returned less than 100 [of them]. The other automobiles have not been returned not because the Bureau is making things difficult, but because their original owners have already disappeared. Car owners currently applying to the Bureau for the return of their vehicles only need to report the original engine number of the car. The Bureau will check with the Public Works Bureau, as there are records of this number when car licenses were applied for before the war. Fortunately, the Public Works Bureau managed to preserve all of this material. Recently, when applying for car licenses from the Public Works Bureau, many were detained by the Bureau. These "black cars" are due to problems with the engine numbers. The Enemy and Puppet Industry Management Bureau has exerted its full effort to return items to their original owners. Furthermore, if car owners discover their car lost during the war in any location, as long as the engine number matches, no matter who currently occupies the car, the Bureau will definitely not show favoritism and will recover and return it.

Several Water and Electricity Companies Returned

[Another Report] Regarding the handling of sealed materials in Chinese merchant warehouses, the Deliberative Committee for the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Industries recently made supplementary decisions: If merchants and civilians purchased and stored goods in the names of others during the period of enemy and puppet occupation due to environmental circumstances, but were unrelated to the enemy and puppets, with a written guarantee from a reputable shop or trade association provided by the owner, the sealed goods will be returned. Furthermore, yesterday the Deliberative Committee approved the return of five ships, as well as the return of the Shanghai Zhabei Water and Electricity Company water plant, the Shanghai Inland Water Company, the Shanghai British Water Company, the Pudong Water Company, and the Anqing Power Plant. The Pudong Water Company was recovered by the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Anqing Power Plant was recovered by the Resources Committee.

### Central Bank Convenes Important Meeting to Discuss Cotton Import Settlement

According to reliable sources: Yesterday morning around 10:00 AM, the Central Bank convened a meeting at its headquarters with cotton importers, yarn factory representatives, and representatives of designated banks. Those present included President Pei Tsu-yi, Ministry of Finance Advisor Dr. Young, Head of the Foreign Exchange Examination Office Lin Weiying, Director of the Business Bureau Lin Fengbao, and others, to discuss cotton import settlement matters. The results were as follows: Most cotton importers, factories, and relevant designated banks have failed to fully comply with the new foreign exchange regulations for cotton import settlement, apparently due to a lack of understanding of the regulations. The Central Bank, recognizing the urgent need for cotton in the country, has approved the provision of foreign exchange for a portion of the cotton price for those who have already settled foreign exchange, provided that the situation permits. The other part of the cotton price should be corrected within a reasonable time to avoid losses to the parties concerned. Regarding cotton that has already been shipped and ordered but not yet sold, the Central Bank, after a comprehensive plan following this meeting, believes that a large amount of cotton will arrive soon, sufficient to meet the market demand for several months. Before the supply and demand situation in the market is fully understood in the future, it is specially recommended that cotton merchants and manufacturers be particularly cautious when making new transactions to avoid the adverse phenomenon of cargo accumulation and congestion at Shanghai docks.

### Establishment of a National Water and Land Transportation Restoration Engineering Planning Group - Fifteen American Engineers Hired Arrive in Shanghai - Scheduled to Depart for North China in Six Teams Tomorrow Morning for Inspection

### Four Traitors Convicted - Mao Renyu and Others - Sentencing Scheduled for the 30th of This Month

[Report from Our Newspaper] The High Court Criminal Division convened a collegial panel yesterday afternoon to rule on four traitor cases and hear three cases. The adjudicated cases include:

Chen Bohua: Served as a committee member of the Nationalist Party branch during the enemy and puppet period, sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for seven years.

Lu Xiling: Served as a secretary in the Jiashan County Government, reported by the people of Jiashan for more than ten crimes, sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for life.

Gu Guoxiong: Secret agent of the Nationalist Military Police in the Southern District, sentenced to eight years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for eight years.

Su Dehuai: Served as an adjutant in the 36th Division of the Puppet Peace Army, sentenced to three years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for three years.

Arguments Concluded in the Wang Chao and Others Cases

In addition, there were three cases heard: (1) Wang Chao, 36 years old, from Yancheng County, served as an inspector in the Puppet Central China Railway Department since the 34th year [1945], but four witnesses proved that it was not true. (2) Sheng Qilong, from Haimen, served as the district chief of the 4th District of Haimen County, illegally arrested people and requisitioned 10,000 stones of grain in the countryside. (3) Fang Jie, from Ningbo, 35 years old, served as a detective in the Political Section of the Special High Division of the Puppet Shanghai Police Bureau, serving under the Japanese Oda.

Unreservedly Admits to Serving in Puppet Positions

[Report from Our Newspaper] Mao Renyu, 47 years old, from Wujiang, Jiangsu, Deputy Director of the Issuing Bureau of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank and concurrently Director of the Issuing Section of the Shanghai Branch, was reported by the Inspection and Statistics Bureau. The High Prosecutor's Office charged that during the period of occupation, the Central Reserve Bank was the financial institution controlling the entire occupied area, and the Issuing Section of the Shanghai Branch promoted puppet currency, absorbed legal tender, and arbitrarily expanded and contracted, resulting in frequent shortages of cash and premium increases for discounts. Its damage to the people's livelihood was extremely evident. As Deputy Director of the Bureau, Mao's responsibilities were extremely important, and therefore a public prosecution was filed. At 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the High Court Criminal Division reopened the public trial. Mao unreservedly admitted to serving as Deputy Director of the Issuing Bureau of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank and concurrently Director of the Issuing Section of the Shanghai Branch from May of the 31st year [1942] until the victory of the War of Resistance. However, he argued that the positions of Deputy Director and Director of the Issuing Section were merely nominal. The power to issue counterfeit currency was in the hands of the traitor Zhou Fohai, the president of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank, and he vehemently denied any close relationship with Zhou. Mao's lawyer argued on his behalf against the accusation that he had accumulated a large amount of wealth and purchased a Swiss-style house, stating that this house was not purchased with wealth accumulated while in office. Furthermore, he stated that if Mao Jingren was truly disloyal, why would he still be employed by the Liquidation Office of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank after Shanghai's recovery. After the arguments were completed, sentencing was scheduled for March 30th.

### "Injured Saint" Wang Changxi to Hold Exhibition, Preparing to Go Abroad for Inspection

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since arriving in Shanghai on the 30th of this month, "Injured Saint" Wang Changxi has been in contact with various military and government agencies to negotiate matters related to propaganda in this city, and preparations are now in place. Yesterday, he hosted a reception at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA to entertain the press of this city, recounting the details of his seven years of travel to various provinces. Wang lost his eyesight and was crippled in both legs during the Battle of Taierzhuang in the spring of the 27th year of the Republic [1938]. Unable to participate in combat, he engaged in anti-Japanese propaganda after many difficulties, traveling to half of the country, a journey of more than 41,000 miles, raising 48 million [Units of Currency], and founding three charity schools in Hengyang, Baoji, and Quanzhou to accommodate the children of anti-Japanese soldiers. Wang is from Tangyi, Shandong, and lost his parents at a young age. He joined the army at the age of sixteen. Feeling the pain of illiteracy, he emulated Wu Xun, striving to raise funds to establish schools. He was imprisoned six times due to misunderstandings. However, he continued to deliver inspirational speeches to major universities and colleges, and comfort wounded soldiers' hospitals, never shirking his hard work, day after day for seven years, gradually earning the respect of the whole country and being hailed as the "Injured Saint." After arriving in Shanghai, with the assistance of the Social Bureau, he will deliver speeches in theaters in rotation every night starting from the 26th, and speak in factories during the day. He will also hold an exhibition in the near future, displaying more than 400 photographs and documents from the places he has traveled over the years. The proceeds from the tickets will be used to fund the Baoji Charity School. He will also go to the United States after returning to the capital to inspect the treatment of veterans and treat his eyes, as Wang's eyes were destroyed by poison gas, and there may be hope for recovery.

### US Military Conducts Sixth Trial in the Murder of Doolittle Raiders Case - Funeral Home Owner Presents Urn as Evidence

Sawada Shigeru, former commander of the Japanese 13th Army, Tatsuta Sotojiro, former director of the Jiangwan Concentration Camp, and Wakou Yusei and Oka Kazutaka, former Japanese military court judges, are being tried for the sixth time yesterday for the crime of murdering airmen belonging to General Doolittle's command. Witnesses who were summoned included Suzuki, a former soldier who served in the 13th Army, and guards who served in the concentration camp, all of whom specified that three airmen were indeed killed by the Japanese. The lawyer Zong Guan, hired by Sawada Shigeru and others, is somewhat talented, and the questions he raised focused on whether the defendants had the authority to order the execution of American airmen. First Lieutenant Weiba, of the US Military Missing Persons Search Office, was also summoned to court. He found the tombstones of the victims in the Shanghai International Crematorium at the end of this year, with the names of the three men engraved on them, as well as the date of their death. Finally, Mr. Stert, the owner of the International Funeral Home, was summoned to court. Stert collected the ashes of the deceased after they were burned in October 1942, and sealed them in small wooden boxes, which he presented in court as ironclad evidence. At that time, Mrs. Homer, the wife of one of the victims, also attended the hearing with Nelson, filled with grief. Afterwards, the presiding officer requested the audience to leave the court due to confidential issues that needed to be discussed. The case is scheduled to be retried tomorrow morning.

### City Divided into Seven Districts for Collection of Property Tax

Collection Not Yet Started in South and East Shanghai

[Report from this newspaper] The method for collecting property tax in this city, as stipulated by the Bureau of Finance, has already begun in January with the collection of winter property tax and will soon be completed. The collection method involves dividing the city into seven districts, each conducting its collection separately. The Real Estate Valuation Section of the bureau will estimate the value of each property based on the prices in the 26th year of the Republic [1937], add sixty times that amount, and then collect fourteen percent of this figure annually as property tax. All funds will be collected on behalf of the Shanghai Municipal Bank. To date, except for the South and East Shanghai districts, where the valuations have not yet been determined and collection has not yet begun, the amounts collected in other districts are as follows: Central District, over 65 million yuan; West Shanghai District, over 67 million yuan; Madang District, over 63 million yuan (the above three districts have collected 80 percent). North Shanghai District, over 29 million yuan; Hongkou District, over 27 million yuan (the above two districts have collected 50 percent). The method for exempting military and government agencies from tax is currently under discussion. Since U.S. troops pay rent for their housing here, their own property tax will be exempted, and only half of the tax, i.e., the tax that the landlord should pay, will be collected. It is said that the spring property tax may be slightly increased to subsidize the cost of uniforms for the Home Guard.

### Two Commanders of Enemy Gendarmerie to Be First to Be Tried

The Shanghai Military Tribunal has been interrogating prisoners in recent days, but the investigation of their crimes and the gathering of witnesses and evidence will take some time, and a public prosecution and trial may not be possible in the short term. It is expected that the first prisoners to be publicly tried by the court will be Mi Changcun (commander of the enemy gendarmerie in Changshu) and Igarashi Saburo (commander of the enemy gendarmerie in Jiangyin), as they committed countless evils during their tenure, and their crimes are obvious. Furthermore, each person has submitted a written statement and is awaiting summons to testify about the facts of their victimization.

### Kader Bathhouse "Treats" Customers

Labor Dispute Benefits Customers

The Kader Bathhouse on Kader Road in this city was established by Xie Baosheng. After the victory [of the war], it was taken over by the Enemy and Puppet Assets Administration Bureau, which treated the workers quite well, so no disputes or accidents ever occurred. Since last month, when Xie's son contracted to operate the bathhouse, he has become increasingly harsh towards the internal staff. The workers have repeatedly requested improved treatment from the labor union, but after four attempts by the union to mediate, all were rejected, leading to the anger of all the workers in the bathhouse. Therefore, starting yesterday afternoon, they all provided service and treated bathers as usual, but did not collect any money.

### Bandits from Taicang Arrested in Shanghai, Young Female Hostage Rescued

Huang A'er and Others Repeatedly Committed Major Kidnapping Cases

Huang A'er and other notorious bandits from Taicang County, who had repeatedly committed major kidnapping cases, were hiding in the Wangjiatang area of Xujiahui in West Shanghai. Qin Liansheng was finding houses for them to live in. Yesterday, Shen Yuanming, the county magistrate of Taicang County, sent a letter to Chen Zhiqing, the chief of the Xujiahui Police Station, requesting assistance in apprehending them nearby. The Judicial Section Chief Chen Kaizhou, along with plainclothes officers Ma Yiqiu and others, were dispatched and arrested the notorious bandit Huang A'er, Qin Wangshi (wife of Qin Liansheng), Wang Gaoshi (wife of the executed notorious bandit Xiao Wanglin), and five other suspects, including Gu Yunsheng and Gu Wangshi, at Wangjiatang and ShanhaiGuan Road. They also rescued a hostage, an eighteen-year-old girl named Gu Sandi, and seized stolen goods, including thirteen gold rings, five pairs of gold earrings, and 94,500 法币.

### Optimistic Prospects for Sino-U.S. Trade: Remarks by Former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, Welcoming the Revision of the New Company Law

[Report from this newspaper] This reporter recently visited Mr. Fessenden, the former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council and now a famous American lawyer, to obtain his views on the revision of the new company law. Mr. Fessenden stated: "I am extremely pleased to learn that the Chinese government has decided to revise the new company law to avoid discriminating against American companies in China. As a result, all existing American companies in China will be able to continue operating. The changes in the registered capital and directors of each company will only be known after the revised company law is officially promulgated and implemented." Mr. Fessenden further explained: "This revision of the new company law is more significant for the United States than for the United Kingdom. All American companies in China under the U.S. China Trade Act are prohibited from operating in the United States, while British companies operate under the trade laws promulgated by the British government in Hong Kong. Nineteen of them have headquarters and branch offices established in Hong Kong. Therefore, if the new company law were not revised, American companies in China would not be able to continue operating, while British companies in China would not be affected in any way." Mr. Fessenden continued: "Since the United States abandoned extraterritoriality in China in 1943, it was agreed at the time that a new Sino-U.S. commercial and friendship treaty would be concluded within six months after the cessation of hostilities and the signing of a treaty. Now that the new company law has been decided to be revised, it is expected that the treaty can be drafted and completed in the short term. Once implemented, trade between China and the United States can be expected to recover and become more prosperous. He remains optimistic about the future of China and Shanghai and predicts that once transportation is restored and currency values stabilize, the future prosperity will be limitless. He himself has lived in China for over twenty years and deeply believes that the people of our country are very rational. Therefore, after the U.S. side raised the issue of the new company law, it was corrected in a reasonable manner."

### No One Applies for Rationed Gold, Gold Price Slightly Improves, Hong Kong Dollar Spot Price Continues to Rise

Yesterday's gold market was erratic. It briefly improved in the morning, but only temporarily. It opened slightly higher at 1.59 million, and after opening, it retreated to around 1.56 million. After entering [the market], the Guangdong brokers and securities brokers entered slightly, and it was pulled up immediately. The Central Bank's [配給] rationed gold was below 1.59 million, the market price was lower than the rationed price, so no one registered to receive the ration. After 11:00, the actual sales were slightly strong, and because the industry had not received rations today, the market price exceeded the Central Bank's rationed price and reached a high price of 1.62 million. There were still many old stocks that were settled at high prices. At noon, it was at 1.59 million. The situation was stable in the afternoon after an initial decline. As a result, it was recovered by 45,000 compared with the previous close. Gold ornaments are listed at 174,000, silver at 1,600, silver dollars at 1,000, and the dark discounts are stable. Interest rates range from 1.6 to 2 jiao. People's hearts have revealed prosperity, and people place high concern on the Central Bank's allocated price next week.

The sales of US dollars are stable. The market opened at 1,960 yuan with a slight supply. After entering, it gradually improved, hovering around 1,965 yuan. As a result, the previous close rose slightly by 15 yuan. Old Hong Kong dollar spot prices were slightly softer due to the constraints of telegraphic transfers. As a result, it returned by a small amount of 5 yuan. Buyers of new goods are still strong. However, after many consecutive days of gains, it is easy to release out old stocks at high prices. Although it rose, it traded at a high price with lots of stock. However, in the afternoon, foreign exchange speculators still heard the news and continued to purchase quite hard. The close was also at a high price. Compared with the previous close, the spot prices of 1936 and 1937 also rose by another 25 yuan and 20 yuan, respectively. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were 435 yuan, and rubies were 535 yuan, all with transactions.

### Guangdong Brokers Collect Spot Yarn, Cotton Transactions Are Scarce, Cloth Factories Ordered to Increase Production

Yesterday's yarn market was stable, and the high-end goods of 20 counts, such as the Golden Rooster, Dafa, and Double Horse brands, were still favored by Guangdong brokers, so the price was particularly high, rising by 230,000. Other 20-count brands also rose by more than 10,000 yuan. The 16-count and double-thread were very ordinary. People's hearts are still stable. Yesterday, the Spinning and Construction Company regularly opened for sale for 23 types, including serge, woolen fabrics, blankets, and 海力司. Cotton yarn will be opened for sale next Monday.

Yesterday, New York American cotton continued to rise by 3 to 9 pounds. The spot price of American gold in the near term was 26.93, the spot price in the long term was 26.89, and the spot price of 米特林 was 27.53. The local spot cotton market situation was flat and tired, and the transaction was almost at a standstill. The amount that the United States lent to China could purchase 300,000 packages of raw cotton, so people were looking to the small side and mostly adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Only ordinary 米特林 was traded by brokers at a stock exchange price of 75,000. The negotiation between the Spinning and Construction Company and various private yarn factories was not carried out, and the transaction was very scarce.

Recently, various private textile factories have made more profits from spinning yarn, so they regard weaving cloth as a difficult task, because it only increases labor costs, and profits are weakened. In view of this, the China Textile Construction Company believed that it was not smooth enough to have cotton cloth supplied by itself, so it specifically informed various private textile factories that they must supply cotton cloth and immediately open for sale. Factories such as Shenxin and Wing On are actively stepping up production for sale in the market.

### Silk Steady but Tired

Yesterday's silk market was steady but tired, and the market was calm.

The offer price for high-quality 5-dan 洋行 goods of factory silk was 2.45 million yuan per dan, and transactions for other dan and 干经 were very rare. Silk goods continue to show a trend of fatigue. Yesterday, the market price of American Asia 被面 was 1.15 million yuan per 100 strips, the price of Dachen fabric was 3,860 yuan per yard, and the transaction price of semi-factory electric spun goods was 45,000 yuan per piece.

### High Prices for Tinplate Due to Continuous Arrival of Kerosene in Shanghai

Since the beginning of this month, the actual sales of tinplate had once stagnated. Many expected it would be difficult to improve in the short term. However, the sluggishness did not last long, and it became active again. This is because the more kerosene arrives, the greater the need for tinplate. The two are closely related and inseparable. With smooth sales, market prices are also good. Currently, 200-pound "Bian Lian" tinplate sells for 280,000 yuan per box, 200-pound "Hui Si Yi" sells for 260,000 yuan per box, and 112-pound kerosene can blanks sell for 150,000 yuan per box. Due to new arrivals, the price of strip tinplate has not improved, ranging from 112,000-130,000 yuan to over 200,000 yuan per box.

### Grain Prices Weaken, Flour Continues to Rise

Yesterday, rice continued to arrive in the market, with average sales. Both Japonica and Indica rice showed a weakening trend, with lower grades seeing little demand and few transactions. White rice was discounted by 1,000 yuan. Flour, with strong demand from Wenzhou and Ningbo, saw demand exceeding supply, rising another 400-500 yuan. Soybeans, on the other hand, gradually declined, with the central region falling another 200-300 yuan, with few transactions. Raw peanuts remained firm, sesame was stable, soybean cakes showed a slight weakness, wheat bran was unremarkable, cotton cakes were temporarily stable, and corn fell slightly by 100 yuan, with weak demand. In the oil market, with arrivals from Qingdao, Kaifeng, Bengbu, Xuzhou, and other places, soybean oil fell by 1,000 yuan and refined oil fell by 2,000 yuan. Crude oil weakened early but stabilized in the afternoon. Except for flour, which rose, the prices of other grains were generally stable or declining.

### Coal Allocation Price Increased

Actual Sales are Slow, Sellers Feel Anxious

The coal market, especially for lump and powdered bituminous coal, heard that the allocation price was increased to 175,000 yuan per ton, delivered at the Pudong wharf. This caused the market price to stop falling and turn firm, and once shouted higher. Fortunately, actual sales were slow, and the price returned to the previous level with little change. There was still demand for screened lump white coal, but sellers still felt anxious and wanted to sell out at high prices, so the price continued to fluctuate slightly. Actual sales of powdered white coal were average, and the market showed little fluctuation.

### Government Bonds Rise Again, Stocks Continue to be Popular, Most Chips Flow into the Hands of the Sichuan Gang

Yesterday, government bonds were affected by "Sun's notes," causing a slight buying surge. The opening price of Class C bonds rose slightly to over 1,800 yuan, and was briefly pushed up to 2,100 yuan. In the afternoon, it declined slightly to 1,920 yuan, up 15% from the previous close. After the close, activity among market participants pushed the price of Class C bonds to over 2,100 yuan. Shanghai stocks were popular as soon as they opened yesterday. However, the popular stocks mostly fluctuated, mainly because market participants did not have much inventory, and all the chips flowed into the hands of the Sichuan gang. As soon as there were buyers, the asking price increased. Operators abandoned popular stocks and tended to collect small stocks and various old stocks. The Commercial Press was shouted up to 140,000 yuan per share, Huacheng Tobacco to 29,000 yuan, and Shanghai Cement to 50,000 yuan, with more buyers than sellers. Before noon, popular stocks such as Wing On Textile had risen to 5,000 yuan, Mayer & Feibel to 4,000 yuan, and King Fook to over 375 yuan, but later fell slightly. The afternoon close was about 10% higher than the previous close, while unpopular small stocks rose more than 20%. In the afternoon, the asking prices of the three popular stocks decreased by half a percent, while the three smaller popular stocks, such as King Fook, weakened even further. Foreign stocks were still popular when they opened, with Ewo Yarns once rising to over 10,000 yuan, before many investors locked in profits and the price slightly declined in the afternoon. The result was about 5% higher than the previous close.

### Clarifying Doubts About the Case of Remaining Cloth and Yarn After the Robbery

— Pan Shihao

The three associations of dyeing, weaving, cotton cloth, and yarn industries applied to the relevant authorities to return the remaining cloth and yarn transferred by the Enemy and Puppet Industry Disposal Bureau from the received Puppet Cotton Association.

After several twists and turns, it is heard that the Industry Review Committee will consider the matter. This is truly a question that should be seriously considered by the relevant authorities. We do not want to talk about legal principles here, because according to legal principles, the property previously seized by the enemy should be investigated and returned by the authorities. This is not only what legal principles dictate, but also what is clearly stipulated in the principles for dealing with enemy property. The cloth and yarn were forcibly purchased at a low price by the enemy puppets in August 1943, with the price being less than a quarter of the market price at the time. A quarter of the payment has not been received. The forced occupation, the fact that more than a quarter of the cloth and yarn was forcibly occupied without compensation, is real and must not be concealed. The Industry Review Committee will surely have a fair and reasonable solution to resolve this dispute. However, there is something that we cannot help but say. Some people may think that this application for return is an action by the three associations themselves, and the damaged cloth and yarn factories did not have this intention. This is contrary to the facts. It must be reiterated that during the war of resistance, the damaged factories had already made secret preparations. After the victory of the war of resistance, countless members urged the responsible persons of the association in writing or orally to strive for the return from the government, and many had already filled out the power of attorney.

Entrusting the Association to Strive for Return

Advertisements were published, seeking help from President Chiang and all sectors of society. A few days ago, the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association held a general meeting of members, and the first resolution was to urge the responsible persons of the association to seriously handle this case. The Cotton Cloth Industry Association and the Yarn Industry Association will hold general meetings of members on the 24th and 26th of this month, and a large number of members have already jointly submitted proposals asking the association to intensify its efforts. The facts are there, and the responsible persons of the association cannot fabricate them. Considering the deep suffering and current difficulties of the cloth and yarn factories, saying that they can ignore the occupied cloth and yarn is against human nature. Some say that although the price paid for the forced purchase was low, gold was distributed in return. Given the rise in gold prices, the victims should have been compensated. We should ask those who say this to carefully calculate the price of cloth and yarn and gold at the time, and then calculate the black market price of gold and the black market price of cloth and yarn when the gold was delayed.

Gold Cannot Fully Compensate for Losses

The booklet "My Views on the Remaining Amount of Cloth and Yarn Forcibly Purchased by the Enemy and Puppet Should be Returned" has a clear calculation, pointing out that the gold issued by the enemy puppets, calculated at the black market exchange rate each time it was issued, plus the banknotes they issued, the actual price received by the damaged factories was only 29% of the market price of cloth and yarn at the time. The original text is clear and there is no forced interpretation.

Others say that the country is still in difficulty, the government's finances are difficult, and the income from enemy and puppet property will be a source for national construction and making up for the finances. Merchants should be considerate. We believe that although the finances are tight, the authorities may not adopt this policy.

The Cloth and Yarn Received by the Puppet Cotton Association are Purely Chinese Cloth and Yarn

There is no enemy or puppet cloth and yarn in it. When the enemy puppets forcibly purchased it, they set up another organization to control the cloth and yarn of enemy merchants, which the Puppet Cotton Association was not involved in. If the cloth and yarn of Chinese people that was forcibly occupied by the enemy and puppets is regarded as enemy property, it is not the original intention of the government and does not comply with the principles for dealing with enemy property. Financial difficulties can be solved by clearly increasing taxes or soliciting donations from industry and commerce. How can we allow confusion and ambiguity, and lose the fairness of legal principles? Even if we take a step back, if the authorities need cloth and yarn for military needs, they can clearly purchase it from all owners at a fair price. Cloth and yarn factories have never been behind others in assisting in national construction and will not have different opinions. How can we forcibly confiscate it and be suspected of plunder?

The reception of enemy property has changed hands several times, and the methods have changed. A part of the cloth and yarn transferred by the Puppet Cotton Association has been sold in transit, and a part has been transferred to other uses. This may also be a pending issue, but as far as my humble opinion is concerned,

Sold Items Can be Investigated

The price can be returned, and the calculation is not difficult. For those that have been transferred to other uses, as long as the use is legitimate, it can be settled at a fair price. It is also possible to persuade the damaged factories to make a clear donation. There is no need to worry about it. The cloth and yarn factories have suffered under the iron hooves of the enemy puppets for a long time. Now it is a great fortune to see the light of day again. If they can be persuaded with reason and compensated for their losses, in my personal opinion, it should be negotiable. Readers should know that in addition to the losses of the yarn factories that may have been compensated, the dyeing and weaving factories and cloth and yarn shops in the entire city are looking forward to a reasonable handling of this case. It is hoped that the government authorities will not focus solely on financial revenue, and the damaged factories will not delve too deeply into legal matters, then wouldn't harmony and prosperity be great?

### Soviet Union Hurls a String of Bombs at Our Country; Terrifying Storm in the Northeast; What is the Reason for Peeling Our Skin, Strangling Our Throat, and Severing Our Lifeline?

— This Newspaper Beiping, 22nd Dispatch by Special Correspondent Zhang Jianmei

The flames of war are spreading in the Northeast. The matter of Yan [馬歇爾] military mediation group's work extending to the Northeast seems to require a considerable amount of time to be realized. This is because the mission of the group sent to the Northeast to execute it has not yet been settled. It is said that Zhou Enlai has proposed two methods for this problem: one is that the mission of the execution group in the Northeast is to investigate, and then the execution department or the three-person meeting will resolve it based on the investigation situation; the other method is that the three parties should first seek a solution principle for the military and political problems in the Northeast, and then send a group to execute it. It is generally judged that if Marshall returns to China recently, it will accelerate the solution of the Northeast problem. At present, the chaos in the Northeast is progressing with time. After the fall of Siping Street, the situation in Harbin and Changchun is also extremely tense. The Soviet troops in these two places may suddenly withdraw, just like in Siping Street, but the military authorities have also made some arrangements for this.

Countries Have Already Compromised to the Utmost; The Soviet Union Gets Everything it Asks For

The commander of the communist army besieging Siping Street this time was Lu Zhengcao, who advanced in four routes from Liaoyuan, Changgang, Bamiancheng, and Lijie. The communist party's command in the Northeast has been unified recently. The military is commanded by Lin Biao, who is the only communist army with mechanized units for combat, and the politics is in charge of Zhou Binzhong.

Countries have already done their utmost to compromise with the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union's diplomatic gains can be said to be getting everything it asks for, and it can be complacent. However, all kinds of diplomatic blitz tactics, all kinds of unexpected demands, a string of bombs, are still being thrown out incessantly, causing the post-war world, which could have been peaceful, to fall into a terrifying storm again. The Soviet Union obviously cannot shirk its responsibility. Moreover, what is the difference between the demand for land (from Turkey), the demand for privileges (from China), and the tsarist Russia? What is the difference between inciting autonomy and independence and dividing the territory of other countries (in Iran and China) and Hitler? What is the difference between coercing by force, and breaking treaties (with China), and the ferocious face of imperialism? Why can the British army stationed in Greece with the consent of the Greek government under the current situation in the United Nations not be withdrawn, while the Soviet army in the Northeast can arbitrarily violate the regulations and delay the withdrawal? Why can they blame the British army for suppressing the autonomy movement in Indonesia, while in China they can incite the border ethnic groups, who originally had no problems, to forcibly divide the territory and harm the integrity of China's sovereignty? These gestures and these methods not only show their unlimited security demands (which naturally hinder the security of other countries), but also threaten world peace, which is obviously an illegal act beyond the norm.

The Focus of Suspicion Among Countries Will Isolate the Soviet Union

Let's just talk about China. The China of the Three Principles of the People has never threatened any country in the past, and will never invade any country in the future. This is because we have the superior conditions of self-sufficiency, and we naturally cultivate the national spirit of loving peace and being friendly to our neighbors. Our only requirement and task is to maintain the integrity of our territory and safeguard the independence of our sovereignty. After this great disaster, we should work hard to restore and build the country, and we want to cooperate sincerely with our great Soviet ally to jointly promote the peace and happiness of mankind. What reason does the Soviet Union have to not be at ease, already peeling its skin (Outer Mongolia), and wanting to strangle its throat (Xinjiang), and even sever its lifeline (the Northeast)?

The reason why we take the trouble to review the Soviet Union's diplomacy during and after the war is still based on the heart of a Bodhisattva, hoping that the Soviet Union will cherish its past glory and not let it disappear easily. Isn't it? The Northeast problem is serious, but isn't the situation between Canada, the Soviet Union and the United States, and the Huangpu River and the Soviet Union, also tense? If a country's situation becomes the focus of suspicion among countries, it is a sign of approaching isolation, and isolation is definitely not a blessing for a country. After the First World War, the Soviet Union's isolation was external, unreasonable, and unreasonable. If the Soviet Union falls into isolation again after the Second World War, it will be self-inflicted and difficult to win the sympathy of the world. The fact is very clear that the future destiny of the world depends on whether the five powers can cooperate. Among the five powers, the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, even if there are still a few problems that cannot be solved in time, the so-called few problems are relatively simple, the four powers' love for peace is relatively sincere, and the diplomatic attitude is relatively open, so there is no room for excessive pessimism in the future. Moreover, the four powers, while feeling the "hide-and-seek" trouble with the Soviet Union's real needs and its diplomatic methods, all have the sincerity to compromise and maintain peace. Therefore, the key to reversing the situation lies only in the hands of the Soviet Union. The Northeast problem is a link in the chain of world unrest caused by Soviet diplomacy. We not only expect the Soviet Union to immediately rein in at the brink of the precipice and make a wise, far-sighted, and essential solution; but also hope that the Soviet Union will re-evaluate its current diplomatic strategy from a global perspective based on general principles. Not to mention the style of the Tsarist era, even the strategic direction of the Soviet Union before the sensitive international dissolution must not be reused. It is imperative that all suspicions disappear and we ascend to the realm of cooperation and happiness together, wouldn't that be "Oh, how grand!"?

Turning calamity into blessing depends on a single thought, and the fate of all mankind in the future, whether to ascend to heaven or enter hell, will also be determined by this one turn. We believe that our great ally—the Soviet Union—will surely know what to choose.

### Impersonating the Eighth Route Army Concentrated in the Northeast and Active

— This Newspaper Changchun, 20th Dispatch by Special Correspondent Yue Ning

When the national army entered Shenyang, the people here seemed to suddenly step into spring from the cold winter. Although there are still gusts of cold wind blowing to chill people's hearts here and now, everyone believes that the haze that has been covering the sky in the past will gradually be blown away by the gentle wind. Because the Soviet army has indeed withdrawn from Shenyang on time, the US Consul General Stark has arrived in Dalian and is engaged in establishing the US Consulate, and the Soviet Union has replied to the US relevant note on the Northeast. Although the content has not been announced, this symbolizes that the ominous Far East situation has tended to ease. Moreover, Marshall, who is running for peace in China, is returning to the United States, which is generally considered to be very meaningful. All of this is enough to show that the diplomacy of the Northeast may enter the right track as a result.

However, there are still some hidden worries that make people feel particularly uneasy at the moment. There are still some obstacles to the takeover of the Northeast. That is, the personnel of the two provincial governments of Heilongjiang and Hejiang have been stranded in Harbin for a long time and cannot go to Bei'an and Jiamusi to take over. And today, Yang Zuoren, a member of the military delegation, has gone north to Harbin to take care of the return of personnel from the two provinces to Changchun. These two provinces were accompanied by Soviet liaison officers to Harbin one month and eighteen days ago. After arriving in Harbin, the Soviet side only told them that the local area was not peaceful and could not go there, so they stayed. Unexpectedly, there is now a saying that "the new government of Heilongjiang has been established," saying that it was established in November last year. If this time is correct, then it has been more than four months since today, and "the establishment of the new government" and "the local area is not peaceful" obviously cannot be "unified." The takeover of Heilongjiang Province is hindered by this, and Hejiang Province should be in the same situation. Reports say that Jilin also has news of the formation of a provincial government, with Zhou Baozhong as the "chairman." Zhou Baozhong's detailed experience is unknown. Only facts are pointed out. When Liu Juying took over the Changchun municipal government on November 14 last year, he claimed to be a yellow lieutenant colonel in a certain country's military uniform, and appeared in the city police station, recruiting troops and buying horses on a large scale, but now he has taken off a certain country's military uniform and changed into a "chairman." Furthermore, Gu Ding (originally named Xu Changji), a writer who praised "Japanese-Manchu cooperation" during the puppet Manchukuo period, claimed to be the "recruitment committee chairman" in Kuanchengzi here in November last year. Anyone who can call up a company of people is a company commander, and anyone who can call up a battalion is a battalion commander. Now he is also employed as Jilin's "People's Education Commissar." There should be a large number of people who have risen up and used force to seek official positions. These two people are active in Changchun sometimes, so people can tell why. The Eighth Route Army in the Northeast is extremely complex, and some classify them as foreign Eighth Route Army (those who fled abroad and returned after August 15), local Eighth Route Army (relative to the foreign Eighth Route Army), big Eighth Route Army (those with higher status), small Eighth Route Army, true Eighth Route Army (Yan'an system), fake Eighth Route Army, acorn flour Eighth Route Army (composed of locals, because they ate acorn flour during the puppet Manchukuo period), and rice Eighth Route Army (those who came from inside the customs, they thought that people inside the customs all ate rice). Since last winter, they have been trying their best to expand. Taking the China Chang Railway as an example, those who go to Dalian from Shenyang for inspection, those who come to Changchun from Shenyang, check on the railway, and those who go from Changchun to Harbin are all checked. All the places of inspection are places where they gather. Whenever the train arrives at their place, in addition to inspection, they shout to see if there are any "central takeover personnel." If they are found, the consequences are not difficult to imagine. However, the situation is different if there are Soviet liaison officers on the train. Liaobei Province went to take over on January 8. The province of Siping has always been under the control of the Eighth Route Army. Recently, plague was discovered in Siping, and the Soviet army in the area completely withdrew after the Soviet army in Shenyang. This happened on the night of the 13th. It is difficult to make a judgment on the situation in Siping at present, but it is only known that the county magistrate of Kaiyuan County in the province was captured by the Eighth Route Army, and the county magistrate of Changtu County has already withdrawn. As for Tie , Liaoning Province, according to transportation sources, the telegraph bureau there is now occupied by the Eighth Route Army, and the long-distance telephone in Shenyang is quite obstructed.

Looking at the overall situation, the haze will certainly be blown away, but these many difficult problems remain to be solved. However, these kinds of difficult problems are easy to solve, and the solution will never make people feel suffocated.

Chongqing Dispatch: The unification movement of the communist army in the Northeast has been slightly effective under the planning of Lin Biao, Nie Rongzhen, and Lu Zhengcao, the three communist army leaders. Yang Jingyu and Gao Yi, the foreign troops of the communist army in the Northeast, have partially changed their flags, but their strength is extremely weak. Zhang Xueshi's troops around Fushun believe that they are the orthodox People's Army, and their number still appears and disappears from time to time. The communist army in the Northeast currently needs huge military expenses. In order to facilitate the absorption of the miscellaneous troops in the Northeast, it is opening up financial resources by various "centrifugal" methods. The Beiping special dispatch published in today's Nanjing Evening News said that the communist army has openly transported opium from outside the customs to sell in Pingjin and other places.

Twelve Soviet economic, electrical, and industrial representatives from Shenyang, reportedly from Changchun, recently visited Mayor Dong, hoping that the factories and industries currently guarded by the police would be handed over to them for start-up and other processing. Dong declined politely, telling them that the Soviet side could not use them before the municipal government received government orders. When the Soviet army withdrew, it handed over 41 factories, warehouses, and houses to the municipal government for safekeeping. According to the Soviet side, the industries were purchased by the Far East Trade Bureau, the Far East Bank Transportation Bureau, and Qiulin Foreign Company. However, according to our investigation, most of them are enemy and puppet industries, so Mayor Dong has submitted a request to the government for verification.

### Prospects for Industrialization in the Northeast

The future development of the nine provinces of the Northeast lies in promoting heavy industry and the chemical industry, making it the base for industrialization of the entire Asia. There are at least three tasks: one is to develop the original industrial base, the second is to develop the industrial resources in the future, and the third is to adapt to the urgent needs of heavy industry. Under this realistic situation, our authorities have established a Northeast industrial policy in order to achieve epoch-making progress.

### Peaceful "Little Beiping" The Spring of Chengdu

— This Newspaper Chengdu, 15th Dispatch by Air, Sent by Qingfeng

Chengdu—This only basin in Sichuan, which is praised as "Little Beiping," as long as you have been there, you will always have a deep affection for it. If you have never been there, then you will definitely feel more longing and infinite sadness.

It is the capital of Sichuan Province and the capital of the Han Dynasty of the Three Kingdoms. It is more than 40 kilometers around the city and is boundless. In Shu, which is full of mountains throughout the province, you will naturally feel the loveliness of this city. There are quite a few historical sites and scenic spots, such as the Zhuge Wuhou Temple, the Du Gongbu Thatched Cottage, the Wangjiang Tower, and the Xue Well...etc. Others, such as the Liu Xiang tomb built in modern times, are huge in scale and meticulously designed, but they are also quite magnificent and well-woven. The above-mentioned places are also very crowded with tourists and very lively. Since the Five Jian Tomb was excavated in the 30th year, it has made Chengdu even more antique, and the houses in Shao City, the classic gates, the three- or four-courtyard bungalows, the spacious courtyards, and the garden equipment all resemble the old capital. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, enemy planes continued to bomb, which caused huge losses to the citizens of Rong in terms of spirit and materials, but invisibly helped the prosperity of the market. Take Citang Street as an example: the road is wide and the city appearance is new, which cannot but be said to be the "gift" of bombing. The spring of Chengdu is said to be the most beautiful and lovely, but because the reporter came and went in a hurry, he inevitably rushed through and was exhausted. Now, I will just briefly describe what I have seen:

### The Largest Speculative Market is Located in a Dilapidated Temple

When it comes to Anle Temple, I am afraid everyone knows it, because it is the largest speculative market in Chengdu and the only speculative market in western Sichuan. It is located in the center of the city. It is said to be the temple of Liu Chan, the Duke of Anle of the Han Dynasty, so its reputation is quite loud, not less than that of Chengdu. However, if you want to see it, then you will definitely not believe it, because such a famous largest speculative market in western Sichuan—a place where several tens of millions or more transactions are made every day—is such a shabby and dilapidated temple, with only an old and not very large hall, and dozens of tables. The tables are full of tea drinkers, and the gaps between the tea drinkers and the back are surrounded by people, either talking loudly about the market or talking softly about transactions. Recently, because of the sharp rise in gold notes in Jin and Shanghai and the recovery of department stores, Anle Temple, which has been quiet for two months, has become active again. At about 9:00 in the morning, hundreds of private chartered cars are lined up outside the temple, and the temple is crowded with people, including bank managers, local gentry, daughters of wealthy families, and rich concubines. In short, they are all friends who have money and leisure. They all want to speculate, they all want to get rich, and they all want to become the second Black Widow. This is the nickname of a capable woman. She is a widow with very dark skin. At first, she was just a cigarette stall owner at the gate of Anle Temple. Later, she earned a little money, so she ran to Anle Temple. At that time, happened to be lucky and department stores followed suit, and she earned one or two tens of millions in half a year, so the name of "Black Widow" became famous. In social occasions and large banquets, such a noble woman was also added. However, there are also poor little brokers who run errands specifically for food.

### Lavish Praise for the "Touching Sleeves" Custom - A Den of Sin

The custom of "touching sleeves" is very prevalent here. Most people extend their hands into the sleeves of others, using three or two fingers to indicate numbers. Even between men and women, it's very common. No one feels there's a difference between the sexes or that giving and receiving should be avoided. I've seen many noble ladies willing to let their powdered hands be touched repeatedly by the coarse, sweat-stained, yellowed-by-smoke hands of others. Because everyone is vying for "profit," they feel it's okay to let others take advantage, as long as they can earn more money.

In front of the hall, there's a large open space with many stalls, the stronghold of Western medicine and cigarette paper businesses. They hold up their fingers and shout prices, rarely "touching sleeves." In the entrance passage, however, the sound of money is loud. Since the "shifting of battlegrounds" of the gold market, this place has become much less attractive.

This place can truly be called a den of sin. Although many have made fortunes here, many have also fallen. It was probably right after the victory! Many who frequented Anle Temple were overwhelmed by the plummeting prices of goods and gold notes, driven to desperation, and could only commit suicide or take poison. But before long, people gathered at Anle Temple again. Speculators! You should be more vigilant and avoid repeating the same mistakes!

### Chengdu's Cultural Heart - Busy and Restless, No Longer Peaceful

Huaxi Dam—this is the cultural heart of Chengdu and also the concentration of higher education institutions. Jinling University, West China Union University, Cheeloo University, etc., except for Sichuan University at Wangjianglou and part of Yanjing University in the city, are mostly concentrated here. The surrounding environment is very good, and the atmosphere of research is very strong. Comparing it with Shapingba in Chongqing, it's a world of difference. Shapingba is just chaotic and noisy, while Huaxi Dam is exceptionally orderly and quiet. Especially the long embankment of Houba, when spring deepens and summer begins, with willows hanging low and couples strolling, I believe that young friends, once they come here, would probably never want to go back. Huaxi Dam, once accustomed to quietness, is now becoming busy and restless, unable to maintain its former peace. Although the spring colors are deepening, Houba isn't as lively as in previous years. Fewer couples are there, and the weeping willows on both embankments aren't as green and vibrant as in previous winters.

### The Flower Fair at Qingyang Palace - This Year, It's a "Bump and Knock"

Qingyang Palace is outside the West Gate (Tonghui Gate) and has almost become the natural venue for the annual flower fair. The name "flower fair" is so appealing. Every year, many people from other counties rush to see the flowers. But in reality, the agricultural tools and seeds on the fairgrounds are even more impressive than the flowers. So, I think it would be more appropriate to call it an agricultural fair rather than a flower fair.

This year, because it's the first flower fair after the victory, the Provincial Department of Construction has specially approved its expansion, and the land rent is therefore higher than in previous years. (Last year, the Flower Industry Association didn't participate because the land rent was too high.) According to the abbot, "We only get to 'bump and knock' this once a year, unlike others who can 'bump and knock' all year round." According to this statement, it seems that their "gouging" is justified.

In addition to the flower market, the flower fair includes an agricultural tools market, a seed market, a bucket market, a bird market, an ironware market, a gourd market, a painting market, and a brush and ink market. There are also stalls selling antiques, tiger balm, medicine, shoes, silks, toys, knives and scissors, combs, jade, and jewelry, etc. The prices are generally higher than in the market, but there are many buyers, especially windmills, which are very popular. Whether adults or children, whoever goes to the flower fair usually comes back with one in hand. The nearby tea restaurants are decorated with pine and cypress branches, and business is excellent. Small food stalls form continuous tents with cloth umbrellas, offering Shuangliu Jiang noodles, Wenjiang Douhua, "Immortal Tangyuan," sugar-boiled sweet potatoes, and cold jelly noodles, Ciba etc., all very busy, creating a scene of "an overwhelming flow on the Shanyin Road."

Recently, some students from Sichuan University staged a full-scale martial arts performance while inspecting marching students, beating each other and injuring many. Incidents like these inevitably paint Chengdu's shadows even thicker.

Oh, Chengdu: When will you truly become peaceful, quiet, and serene? (March 15th)

### Iran: Land of Petroleum

Iran, formerly known as Persia, is mostly a high and dry plateau, averaging about four thousand feet in altitude. It is surrounded by towering mountains, with the northern ranges reaching as high as eighteen thousand seven hundred feet. The climate in the south and central regions is unbearably hot, while the climate in the north is extremely cold. The temperature on the plateau varies greatly between winter and summer. In some places, it drops to thirty-two degrees Fahrenheit in winter and rises to eighty degrees Fahrenheit in summer. Most areas receive less than ten inches of rainfall, with twenty inches in the northeast and forty inches on the narrow plains along the Caspian Sea, where the land is fertile. The Persian Gulf coast receives sufficient rainfall, but the hot tropical climate is unhygienic. The central and eastern regions are vast expanses of abundant sandy minerals. The Karun River is Iran's only important navigable river, passing through the fertile lowlands of Khuzestan and entering the Persian Gulf.

People and Products

Iran has a population of fifteen million, of whom about two to three million are semi-nomadic, a number that is gradually decreasing. The rest mostly live in small towns and villages, mainly in the fertile areas near the Caspian Sea or in the northwestern province of Azerbaijan. In these two regions, crops can be grown without irrigation, but this is not possible on the plateau. The main crops are wheat, cotton, sugar, rice, fruit, and opium. Foreign trade is monopolized by the government. World-famous Persian carpets are the main industrial product. Other established industries include yarn mills, silk mills, carpet factories, cigarette factories, and cement plants. The main export is mineral oil. Iran's oil production normally accounts for the world's fourth-largest. Other minerals include coal, iron, steel, lead, copper, manganese, and nickel, but they have not yet been exploited on a large scale.

Turbulent History

Cyrus the Great established the Persian Empire two thousand five hundred years ago, encompassing all of the Middle East from India to the Mediterranean and from the Caucasus to the Indian Ocean. The Persian Empire was overthrown by Alexander the Great of Macedon in 331 BC. After that, Persian history entered a turbulent phase. In 636 AD, it was invaded by the Arabs; in the early 13th century, by the Mongols; it engaged in wars with the Romans, Huns, and Turks and experienced repeated internal strife. However, the Persians were able to maintain their national character and traditions, remaining unchanged.

Since the 19th century, Persia has been increasingly influenced by Western civilization, because it occupies an important strategic position for Britain, Russia, and France: for Britain, it could be used to defend its route to India; for Russia, to protect its southern border; and for France, it was a necessary condition for its ambition to expand its territory in the East. In 1901, oil was discovered in southern Persia, and since then, Persia's position has become even more important.

In 1906, at the request of the people, the autocratic rule of the Persian emperor came to an end. A new constitution was promulgated, establishing an upper house (half appointed, half elected) and a lower house (elected every two years). Prime Minister Reza Khan was elected emperor in the general election of 1925. During his reign, he worked hard to develop transportation and irrigation.

In August 1941, the British and Soviet governments demanded that the Iranian government expel German nationals. The British and Soviets were dissatisfied with the Iranian government's response to this matter and occupied Iran at the end of August. Emperor Reza abdicated, and the crown prince ascended the throne, expelling Axis personnel. In September 1941, Iran severed diplomatic relations with Germany and Italy, and in April 1942, it severed relations with Japan. In September 1943, Iran declared war on Germany. In January 1942, Britain and the Soviet Union signed an alliance treaty with Iran, in which they pledged to respect Iran's independence and territorial integrity. In the Tehran Declaration of December 1943, the three leaders declared "unity with the government of Iran, hoping to maintain Iran's independence, its sovereignty, and territorial integrity."

Due to its oil supply, especially its strategic position, Iran is of utmost importance to the United Nations. It is a base for defending India and the Middle East. It is a strategic liaison station for transporting military supplies to the Soviet Union. Highways and railways have been improved and used by British and American troops to transport Lend-Lease materials from the Persian Gulf to the Soviet army. (Translated by Zhang Deqian)

### The Northeast Problem is Under the Watchful Eyes of the World - The Soviet Union Should Make a Choice

The recent intensification of the Northeast problem has aroused concern among the people of the entire nation, and people around the world are also paying close attention to its development prospects. It is seen that this problem is not simply a matter concerning China's sovereignty, but rather an issue that affects world peace as a whole. At this critical juncture when the world is watching and the nation is filled with anxiety, President Chiang, in his address at the Central Memorial Week on the 25th, guaranteed that the Northeast problem would be solved properly, called on the people of the nation to trust the government, and not to be rash. He also reaffirmed that the friendship between China and the Soviet Union must be maintained and must continue to be enhanced, and should not be shaken by temporary or singular events.

President Chiang's instructions not only calmed the widespread anxiety and uncertainty, but also clarified the consistent diplomatic policy of maintaining and continuing to enhance Sino-Soviet friendship. In addition to wholeheartedly embracing President Chiang's correct instructions and completely trusting the government and supporting the government in order to achieve the goal of safeguarding national sovereignty, we are still willing to follow the ancient teaching of "loving people with virtue" and conduct a broad review of the diplomacy of the Soviet Union, a friendly nation, and offer sincere advice.

Let us try to review history. After the end of World War I in 1918, the world was swept by the tide of communism. Under the leadership of Britain, an anti-communist front was formed, and the Soviet Union was ostracized and isolated by various countries. This policy was later criticized by far-sighted politicians, because it threatened the security of the Soviet Union and indirectly affected future world peace. As the situation evolved, and with suspicions still not eradicated, Britain and France pulled the Soviet Union into the international group, until the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact in August 1939. In between, the Soviet Union became the most faithful supporter of the League of Nations and the most enthusiastic advocate of collective security. Especially around the Munich Agreement in September 1938, the Soviet Union's diplomatic performance won the favor of people around the world; this was because it fully demonstrated the spirit of upholding justice and keeping treaties. As for the announcement of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, although it caused shock and unpleasant feelings among people at the time, since it did not receive understanding from Britain and France, the three-nation talks failed, and it was left hesitating between the democratic and aggressive (fascist) camps. In the end, it had no choice but to ally with Germany in order to ensure the temporary security of the country. The world gave it sympathy and forgave it. In June 1942, Hitler betrayed the treaty and suddenly attacked the Soviet Union. At this time, the Soviet Union not only became a faithful ally of the democratic camp, but also dispelled all the suspicions that the world had previously harbored towards it. Moreover, due to its creation of unprecedented brilliant achievements, all the allied countries that shared weal and woe with it gave it the highest respect. All of this shows that the Soviet Union has made painstaking efforts and great contributions in the pursuit of national security and world peace, and the people of the world, in their pursuit of truth, have invariably expressed admiration for those countries that strive for truth.

This glorious history of the Soviet Union truly inspires infinite longing and infinite hope in mankind. The world eagerly expects that it will be the strongest pillar in the arduous task of maintaining world peace and creating human happiness.

Unfortunately, since the collapse of Hitler and the unconditional surrender of Japan, up to the present day, truth in the Soviet Union's diplomatic performance has gradually evolved into a kind of mysterious and unfathomable principle. The impact of this has been to cause waves on the international political stage, one after another, dazzling people and making them feel overwhelmed. No wonder British Foreign Secretary Bevin issued an urgent call to it to "lay down the last trump card in your hand." This kind of Soviet diplomatic style, which transcends truth, has clearly caused widespread anxiety among peace-loving countries. From expectation to disappointment, from admiration to suspicion, the psychology of the world is changing. We feel that it is a great pity for the Soviet Union.

### Opening Ceremony of the Political Consultative Conference

— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in Chongqing, Zhao Haosheng

The first Political Consultative Conference after the victory, held after the Second Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Kuomintang and before the National Assembly, is of extremely great significance. It also coincides with the late spring month of March, when Chongqing is truly the flowering season for politics.

On the day of the opening, 212 councilors had already registered. At the entrance to the hall, everyone patted each other on the shoulder, shook hands, and exchanged greetings. Various accents were heard, creating an atmosphere of "dear friendship."

Approaching the Qingming Festival, in this time of intermittent warmth and cold, the councilors were dressed in a dazzling array of styles. Mr. Wang Zhanxiao wore a long gown and mandarin jacket, topped with a boat-shaped felt hat, a truly harmonious blend of Chinese and Western styles, with a unique flair. Xie Bingxin wore a blue gown, covered with a black velvet coat, looking thin, calm, and graceful. Chu Fucheng held a cane, while Zhang Junmai sported a complete set of elegant Western-style suits and coats, showing impressive manners. Hu Lin had just returned from the North the day before, and Cheng Shewo pulled him over, saying, "Brother, you've gotten fatter after your trip to the North."

Wang Yunwu had a "big kid" air about him, always lively and energetic, with a smile on his face. The elderly Mr. Shao Congen was once again escorted by his group. The old gentleman's movements and speech were all trembling, making him sound particularly touching. After signing his name, he bowed and greeted the elderly Mr. Liu Wenlong.

The hall was simply and plainly decorated. On the podium, there was a long table with a row of fresh flowers, and nothing else. The row on the right side of the hall was the seating area for the heads of the various ministries and commissions, followed by the seating area for foreign envoys and guests. The seating area for news reporters was originally on the long chairs against the wall, but moved to the guest seating area. In the coming ten-plus days, there will be another "scramble for seats" every day, and the "guest seating area" will probably become the reporter seating area due to "established fact."

The councilors sat in the two-thirds of the seats on the left side, still in assigned seats.

Two staff members from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sat in the front row of the foreign guests, serving as hosts. Soviet Ambassador Petrov brought Secretary Federin, who speaks Chinese the best, and sat in the second row.

President Song, Secretary-General Wu, and Deputy Chief of Staff Bai all arrived very early. Chief of Staff Chen Cheng arrived later, shaking hands and greeting everyone along the way, extremely busy.

Secretary-General of the Assembly Shao Lizi and Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen, the former short and stout, the latter tall and thin, stood under the stage before the meeting, gesturing and talking nervously, making for a very interesting scene.

After the ceremony, President Chiang stepped into the meeting hall, and the entire hall stood at attention, with thunderous applause, which did not stop until the President stepped onto the stage and took his seat. The President repeatedly smiled and bowed in thanks amidst the applause of the entire assembly. When Mr. Mo, in his address, mentioned that the hard-won victory of the eight-year war of resistance should first pay the highest respect to the Head of State, the entire assembly applauded loudly again, and the President once again bowed in thanks.

Mr. Mo's report, delivered in a pure Northeastern accent, was filled with extremely moving emotion. When he proposed that the assembly should pay attention to the Northeast problem, the entire assembly applauded loudly.

Before reading his speech, President Chiang specifically mentioned that the success of the victory of the War of Resistance, in addition to the blood and sacrifice of the people and soldiers of the entire nation, should especially thank the assistance of the Political Consultative Conference and the efforts of the people and government of Sichuan. The President's speech, which lasted about half an hour, constantly evoked prolonged and enthusiastic applause.

He Zhuhong's response, delivered in a pure Hebei accent, and Mr. Mo's Northeastern speech evoked a solemn and heavy feeling in the audience at the assembly.

When Zhu Huiqing questioned the economic report, he mentioned the establishment of the China Textile Corporation, saying that it violated national policy, broke faith with the allies, and even led price increases, becoming simply a price-increasing company. Was this really the government's policy? He said with emotion, "I'm afraid society is going to collapse."

Feng Shangdong asked Weng Wenhao: Is there a legal basis for the Executive Yuan's office?

Zhang Longguang questioned President Song, "Is the Executive Yuan's administrative efficiency relaxed? Can President Song be at peace?"

Someone asked, "Why, after the restoration of the Northeast, has it suffered so much from the ravages of war? Does the central government need tens of thousands of people?"

During the previous inquiries, someone complained that our diplomacy was too weak. (20th)

Cinema and Drama

### The Road of Chinese Cinema

— Shao Cui

When the World Film Gathering was held in Venice in 1934, Austrian President Miklas delivered a valuable opinion on cinema. He said, "I believe that films should be used to educate and guide the masses, and the 'essence' expressed purely by film should be estimated and measured by its educational components. Even if the technical aspects of the film are expressed in a beautiful and excellent way, they must not violate the sacred concepts of mankind, but should contribute truth, goodness, and beauty, and avoid all profanity. They must not violate science and art, and even more so, they must not deviate from human and ethical points of view. Film is the 'transmission' of knowledge, and at the same time, a special art. Film is expressed on the screen by mixing the melody and music of human language. Art should always be noble and free, in other words, not violating ethical concepts. It must not incite obscenity, cruelty, or evil. Art is meant to bring joy and hope to those who toil daily, and to encourage them to move forward and upward. If every filmmaker can work towards this goal, they will naturally make a very great contribution to mankind."

Although President Miklas was speaking to the American film industry at the time, his opinion was actually aimed at the entire film industry. According to his view, film should bear a social mission. We agree with this valuable opinion of President Miklas. As a tool for "transmitting" the experience of human life, its value is of course incalculably higher than as a tool for entertainment. However, in order to "learn with interest," it is also necessary to retain amusing entertainment components, but it must be understood that this is only a means of achieving educational effectiveness, and not the purpose of film.

However, flipping through the catalogues of films produced by various countries around the world, there are indeed not a few films that conform to what President Miklas described, but most films still cannot escape the control of "Mammonism," turning into purely entertaining and recreational products in order to cater to the preferences of special leisure classes.

Looking at the entire Chinese film market for many years, at least 80% of the foreign films imported and screened are entertainment-oriented. If they contain educational significance, it is also of a negative nature. This is not to say that foreign film companies specifically import entertainment-oriented films into China to anesthetize and incite the Chinese people, but it is actually to cater to the base psychology of the general Chinese audience. When I was in Chongqing, several foreign film company merchants told me that Hollywood producers and distributors had expressed extreme surprise when they saw the Chinese market sales statistics, because films with slightly more serious awareness and higher taste could not make money in China. On the contrary, what could be welcomed by the Chinese audience were those colorful films with thighs, hugs, singing and dancing, detectives, and martial arts. In order to make profits, they naturally had to select and arrange these kinds of things to come. Looking back at our own production achievements, in terms of awareness and art, all the domestic films in the past are unbearable to discuss in detail. During the War of Resistance, all commercial companies collapsed, and the state-run film production institutions did not have satisfactory results due to the limitations of material conditions. But now that we have won, the Chinese film industry has reached a stage of emerging development. State-run film production institutions have begun filming, and commercial film companies will certainly spring up like mushrooms after rain in the near future. Therefore, I am writing this short article to specifically call the attention of our filmmakers: film is an important tool for education, and it bears a social mission! In China, there is an even more urgent need for this kind of educationally significant film. Therefore, we hope that the new films of China's future, in terms of technology, will be able to catch up with Europe and the United States, and in terms of awareness, must never violate the sacred obligations to mankind, avoiding all blasphemy; not violating ethics, and even more so, not inciting obscenity, cruelty, or evil. On the contrary, we expect films with social missions as educational tools, to use their great and sacred "transmission" to awaken our people from their drunken stupor, and to improve the society that has fallen morally and lost its ethics! Furthermore, to save our country and nation from baseness, poverty, and disorder!

### Ticket Price Issues

— Hawk

The current movie ticket prices are unreasonably high. Anything that has increased more than a hundredfold in the past half-year or so is unreasonable. And movie ticket prices have increased more than a hundredfold.

Movie theater owners are taking advantage of Shanghainese people's love of movies to raise prices crazily. Like a triple jump, from the fake currency price of 2,000 yuan for first-run tickets in mid-August last year (legal currency 10 yuan), it has risen to the current minimum ticket price of 1,400 yuan. I want to say again, this is unreasonable. When first-run prices rise, second and third-run prices follow suit, and they rise sharply, which further promotes the "adjustment" of first-run prices again. Such repeated "adjustments" circulate endlessly, making it difficult for the general public to watch movies.

Calculate how many times rice has increased during this period? How many times has electricity increased? How many times have donation fees increased? How many times have general prices increased? How many times have other expenses increased? I believe that on average it is less than fifty times. Moreover, the number of viewers is now many times greater than before, as you can see by looking at the "Sold Out" signs.

However, movie theater owners don't care about these things. They are still not satisfied with the "one ticket for half a *dou* of rice" principle! They specifically took the "This theater is ordered to collect 50% entertainment tax from today" announcement as an excuse to distract the audience. Regrettably, the municipal government, in order to greedily pursue higher tax revenue, has forgotten the purpose of movies as a means of mental adjustment and education for the general public, and has approved the price increase. And it has increased so drastically!

I think the ticket prices should not be so close together as they are now (taking the first-run as 1,400, 1,600, 1,800). Instead, they should be spaced relatively far apart as they were before the war. That is to say, the lowest ticket price should be suppressed as much as possible, and the highest ticket price may be slightly higher. Before the war, the difference between the highest and lowest was often three or four times. Now? It's only one-tenth or two-tenths. This is too disproportionate. This can not only be considerate of the general public, but it is also beneficial to the theaters, and it does not lose the purpose of entertainment for the masses. As for the gap between first and second runs, and second and third runs, there should also be a considerable distance (previously it was more than one or two times), so that it is not easy to stimulate further price increases.

Secondly, in terms of brochures, they should not be so cluttered and disorganized. Often, two or three kinds of so-called "special editions," which are extremely poor in content, are printed and sold at high prices. This is an invisible loss for the audience. The theater authorities should print one or two pages of plot descriptions in a standardized format, and give them away with the tickets, or at least sell them at cost. Asia Theater used to be very ideal in this regard. Although the movie synopses in a certain major newspaper's supplement is a remedy, it does not seem to be very good.

Weekly Movie Reviews

### ### Counterattack in Burma by Lang Huan

— Lang Huan

This is a film with war as its theme. Like a group of films with war as their theme, it is more or less inevitable that it will be somewhat exaggerated, but because the actors are responsible, the insertions are appropriate, and the photography is beautiful, it is still a film worth recommending.

The prologue is General Stilwell's vow to restore Burma, followed by the plot unfolding in an exciting mood. A team of American paratroopers stationed in the tea plantation in northern India, led by Captain Nelson (played by Errol Flynn), are eagerly awaiting departure when they receive instructions to risk destroying the Japanese radar base 150 miles behind the Japanese front line.

More than fifty paratroopers, led by Captain Nelson, set off together. Among the group are Lieutenant Jacob (played by William Prince), war correspondent William (played by Henry Hull), and Chinese liaison officer Captain Li Hao, etc. After arriving at their destination, Captain Nelson used clever tactics to destroy the Japanese radar base. However, the entire army has fallen into a forest surrounded by enemies on all sides. Although Captain Nelson urgently led his subordinates to the pre-designated location to wait for the plane to rescue them back to defense, at that moment, a large patrol of the Japanese army suddenly arrived, and the paratroopers were surrounded.

Captain Nelson divided the troops into two teams, with another team led by Lieutenant Jacob, to break through and then regroup. Although Captain Nelson's team escaped after experiencing danger and received air support, the troops led by Jacob were surrounded and martyred due to being deeply involved in the enemy's forces.

Nelson and others mistakenly believed that Jacob and others were still alive, and urgently went to rescue them. Although they had a last meeting with Jacob, many members of the team were killed or injured due to the Japanese army's pursuit.

After this, they were forced to endure hunger and thirst, the invasion of disease, and the Japanese army's tracking and attacks. William and others died on the way because they could not bear the hardship, and the wireless telegraph was destroyed, further severing all contact between the entire team and the headquarters. However, Nelson and others, with their indomitable courage, finally obtained assistance, and used clever tactics to wipe out a large number of advancing enemy troops. At this time, a large number of allied forces also attacked Burma, and Nelson led the remaining eleven heroes and returned to the base.

In the film "Counterattack in Burma," Errol Flynn's performance can be said to be very successful. He has a fairly profound simulation of the kind of passionate and determined personality of a soldier, especially in the scenes where he bids farewell to Jacob and encourages his subordinates on the mountain.

The plot has been developing in a tense manner. The tense expression when parachuting is very realistic. The scene of destroying the enemy on the mountain is quite beautiful, but the best part is Nelson's dim expression when he returns to the base and hands over the badges of the fallen troops, which makes people get some aftertaste, and feels that this is at least not a purely propaganda or nonsense film.

The foolishness of the Japanese army is portrayed a little too much, but their crimes of abusing prisoners and slaughtering innocents may not be fully depicted.

Because the cinematography director of this film is Chinese cinematographer Huang Zongzhan, there is some proud joy when seeing the beautiful pictures in the film. Although Tang Fo-lan, who plays the Chinese liaison officer Captain Li Hao, feels a bit dull and has no expression, it does not reduce the audience's interest in the appearance of Chinese people in the film.

After watching "Counterattack in Burma," because of the similarity of the scenes, I naturally thought of "The Human Comedy" starring Spencer Tracy, but one is full of the smell of invading small nations, and the other expresses the idea of resisting tyranny and defending justice. The standpoint is indeed different. Perhaps this is the reason why "Counterattack in Burma" has gained the audience's sympathy.

### The Three Theaters of the Film Industry

Mental Asylum, Nursing Home, and Sanatorium

The three surviving film studios in Chongqing once had the "elegant names" of mental asylum, nursing home, and tuberculosis sanatorium. What is the inside story? Please read the following article.

The people in "China Film Studio" are mostly young and strong, and things like fighting and causing trouble often happen. For example, the "burning of Benlan's military service film" and "collective attack on a certain movie theater" incidents, this is in terms of external relations. Internally, mutual friction and pulling out fists are also common, so it is called a "mental asylum."

The people in "China Electric Film Studio" are mostly old-fashioned, living in the southern city and not listening or asking. In terms of work, they maintain a rigid attitude of "seeking no merit but seeking no fault." People call it a "nursing home." Who says it's not appropriate?

"China Education Film Studio", located in Beibei, is presided over by Chen Guofu, who suffered from lung disease in his early years. The late deputy director Yu Zhongying had severe lung disease. Moreover, because the environment there is quiet and the air is fresh, it is very suitable for treating lung diseases. "China Education Film Studio's" film production mainly focuses on 16mm small-format films, and the production is relatively slow, as if suffering from lung disease.

Thus, the three theaters, the mental asylum and the nursing home, have successively moved to Shanghai, and the sanatorium will also move to Beijing soon. I hope that moving the theaters will be good. The lunatics in the "mental asylum" will return to a normal state as soon as possible. The old-fashioned people in the "nursing home" will sweep away their twilight mood. The lung patients in the "sanatorium" will gradually become healthy.

Social Services

### Confucius Society – Inspiring Loyalty

Soliciting Modern People's Deeds

In order to correct social customs and respond to the New Life Movement, the Confucius Society has launched a campaign to solicit moral deeds of modern people from various provinces, counties, and townships, namely (Filial Piety, Brotherly Love, Loyalty, Faithfulness, Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, Shame). Anyone who conforms to one or several of the eight virtues can report the facts to the society. After the society investigates and verifies the facts, it will compile the deeds into a book and publish a special collection to promote and encourage loyalty. It will also issue certificates of merit in accordance with the articles of association. Those who conform to several virtues will be recommended by the society to the government for commendation. This move by the society is indeed beneficial to people's hearts and will enhance social morality. Anyone from all walks of life who knows of such facts can send a letter to the society to report them. The society's address is 954 Zhongzheng Road, Confucius Society.

### Answering Readers

Chen Huchu from Nantong Tangzha asked: My son is nine years old, strong and healthy, and is now suffering from epilepsy, which has gradually made his nerves sluggish. Last year, one night at midnight, he got up in a drowsy state, urinated, and then sat upright on the bed, his eyes squinting upwards. I called him repeatedly, but he did not respond. Later, after drinking warm soup, he regained consciousness. The next morning, he had no symptoms, so I did not suspect anything. But this year, after falling asleep, he gave a cry, and then his eyes widened and his limbs twitched uncontrollably. His breathing seemed to be blocked and he had phlegm sounds. It lasted for five minutes before it stopped. After he recovered, he was extremely exhausted. Please advise on treatment methods.

Doctor Qi replied: Your son's illness is likely to be epilepsy. A detailed examination of his blood, urine, and nervous system is necessary to determine the treatment plan.

Xiao Guorong and Xu Liangsun asked: (1) Can vaccination with cowpox provide immunity? Should it be done every year or two?

Doctor Gu Yuqi replied: Vaccination with cowpox can provide immunity. It is best to vaccinate once a year. Adults can do it every other year, but it is still advisable to vaccinate every year during a smallpox epidemic.

Tian Shiyu asked: I masturbated when I was fifteen or sixteen years old. I got married at seventeen and had affairs with prostitutes because of incompatibility, and contracted gonorrhea. Fortunately, I used medicine and recovered in two months. Now I feel cold in my kidneys and have premature ejaculation and soreness. Please advise on treatment methods?

Doctor Xian Yuqi replied: This kind of symptoms requires medicine to replenish blood and strengthen the body and replenish internal secretions, which may lead to recovery. It is hoped that you will seek treatment from a specialist doctor.

### Letter from a Reader in Huangdu – Reporting Illegal Exactions

Please Investigate by Military and Political Authorities

Dear Editor: Our town, Huangdu, is located between Shanghai and Suzhou, and is an important road and waterway. Most of Shanghai's rice passes through our town. Recently, some unscrupulous people have been detaining ships loaded with rice bound for Shanghai one by one, extorting two *sheng* of grain per *shi* as a donation for their own benefit. Otherwise, passage is not allowed. In terms of reason, this is indeed illegal. The receipts they issue do not bear the name of the county government or the district office, which is undoubtedly an extortion. At this time of the restoration of peace, there are still such shameless people using public office for private gain, which greatly affects the recent soaring rice prices in Shanghai. I humbly request your newspaper to disclose this and urge the military and political authorities to take effective measures. The Qingpu County Government should strictly order the eradication of these corrupt elements who oppress the people, for the benefit of the 3.5 million people of Shanghai. Huangdu Town resident Dai ×× respectfully.

### Forged Donation Coupons Used as Aid – Collection Stopped Immediately

Recently, we have received generous donations of counterfeit banknotes from all walks of life to be used as aid, which is truly commendable. This column has transferred them all to the Shanghai Municipal Education Loan Committee for counting and acceptance, which will be announced soon. It is found that the exchange of counterfeit banknotes will end at the end of this month, and the acceptance will be stopped from today. Please, dear contributors, be informed.
