### Minister Wang Discusses Foreign Policy, Clarifies the Position of Our Government, Establishes Commercial Treaties Based on the Principles of Equality and Mutual Benefit

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The Foreign Correspondents' Press Conference of the Central Propaganda Department was held as usual at 4:30 PM on the 18th in the reception room of the International Propaganda Office of the National Goods Building. Those present included Minister Peng Xuepei, Minister Wang Shijie, Director Liu Quechang, Chief Zeng Xubai, Central Propaganda Department Advisor Bell, and over forty Chinese and foreign journalists. First, Minister Peng gave a speech, introducing Foreign Minister Wang, who had just returned from Paris, to the reporters. Wang then stood up and briefly stated: "I feel very pleased to meet with all the reporters today, and I hope that my answers to your questions will be helpful to all of you." He then answered each of the questions raised by the reporters one by one. The main questions and answers are recorded as follows:

Question: (1) In future foreign relations, will China still adhere to the "open door" policy? Now that extraterritoriality has been abolished, does Your Excellency believe that the "open door" policy will also change accordingly? (2) In China's commercial negotiations with the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries, will the concept of "most favored nation" be generally applied? Will certain specific countries receive special rights?

Answer: I would like to answer these two questions together. The established policy of the Chinese government is to make every effort to utilize foreign capital and technology to develop China's resources and improve the living standards of the Chinese people. This is the guiding principle of our country's recent legislation on commercial company issues and related matters. The Chinese government intends to grant most-favored-nation treatment to all countries that conclude commercial treaties with us. The condition for enjoying this treatment is reciprocity. China does not intend to adopt any discriminatory treatment towards any foreign country in any part of its territory. If this attitude can be considered an "open door" policy, then the so-called "open door" is actually China's own policy. However, we must solemnly declare that, regarding such economic and commercial matters, China's international obligations must be limited to the conventions, treaties, or other agreements that China has participated in, just like other matters.

Question: Will the 21-nation peace conference in Paris become a blueprint for future peace conferences with Germany and Japan?

Answer: In terms of procedures and conference organization, I believe that the Paris Peace Conference will generally serve as a model for peace conferences with Germany and Japan. In terms of substantive issues, there will inevitably be some differences in the peace treaties with Germany and Japan. However, the basic attitude of the United Nations towards all peace treaties should be to seek a fair and lasting peace with a spirit of coordination.

We Should Obtain a Superior Proportion of Assets Designated as Reparations from Japan

Question: In the future peace treaties with Germany and Japan, will China advocate harsh or lenient terms?

Answer: China's attitude can be briefly described as follows: In military terms, such as preventing the resurgence of militarism, the peace treaty must establish very effective safeguards. In economic and political terms, if the terms of the peace treaty are too harsh, they will be exploited by reactionary forces in the defeated countries, making it difficult for democratic and peaceful forces to rise. We must avoid this situation. Under no circumstances should the peace treaty adopt a policy of revenge.

Question: What is the progress on the issue of Japanese reparations? What is China's goal in demanding reparations from Japan?

Answer: The preliminary discussions on the issue of Japanese reparations by the Reparations Committee have not yet been completed. Member states are currently consulting on the establishment of a specialized agency to handle this matter. As for China's demands, I would only like to state at this time that we have resisted the longest and suffered the greatest losses. We should obtain a superior proportion of assets within and outside Japan that can be designated as reparations. The Potsdam Declaration stipulated the general principles for the issue of Japanese reparations. China has accepted it. The total amount of Japanese reparations will be determined in accordance with this principle. China has no intention of keeping the Japanese economy in a state of perpetual bankruptcy and servitude. I believe that no other country in the United Nations has this intention either.

Use of the Lushun Naval Port Should Be Handled in Accordance with Regulations

Question: What is the current status of Dalian? What progress has the Chinese government made in taking over the Dalian municipal administration? Are Soviet troops still occupying Dalian? Have China and the Soviet Union agreed on a specific date for the withdrawal of Soviet troops?

Answer: The Chinese government has not yet taken over Dalian. There is no detailed information regarding this matter.

Question: The United States has requested to establish a consulate general in Harbin. Has the government discussed this with the Chinese Communist Party?

Answer: The Chinese government has expressed its agreement to the United States establishing a consulate general in Harbin.

Question: Regarding the joint use of Lushun as a naval port by China and the Soviet Union, will China firmly uphold its treaty rights?

Answer: China will naturally handle it in accordance with the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Alliance.

Question: According to the Central News Agency, the Chinese government has sent an official representative to Seoul to serve as a representative in the US military occupation zone in Korea. Under what title is this person serving? What is the status of Chinese people in the Soviet military occupation zone in Korea? Is the Chinese government currently discussing with Soviet representatives the dispatch of Chinese representatives to the Soviet military occupation zone in Korea?

Answer: The Chinese government will establish a consulate general in Seoul, within the American occupation zone of Korea. As for the area ruled by the Soviet Union, we plan to discuss this matter with the Soviet authorities in the near future.

Our Policy Toward Vietnam: We Wish to See Autonomy and Independence

Question: Will the new Sino-French Agreement concluded on February 28 of this year become a good foundation for Sino-French relations in the future?

Answer: Yes.

Question: What is China's basic policy toward Vietnam? Since Chairman Chiang issued a statement last year advocating autonomy and independence for Vietnam, has the Chinese government's attitude changed?

Answer: Our attitude towards Vietnam has not changed. The Chinese people and government wish to see the people of all colonies realize their aspirations for autonomy and independence within a reasonable period of time. We are very pleased to hear that negotiations between the French government and the Viet Minh representatives have made progress.

Question: Is there hope for China and France to conclude a commercial treaty soon?

Answer: China will begin negotiations with the French government soon.

Question: What are Foreign Minister Wang's opinions on Foreign Minister Bidault's attitude at the peace conference?

Answer: At the conference, Mr. Bidault led the French delegation and made every effort to reduce the difficulties encountered by the conference. Mr. Bidault's abilities are admirable.

We Will Support Siam to Join the United Nations

Question: Does China support Siam's request to join the United Nations?

Answer: China is willing to support Siam's request to join the United Nations.

Question: Does China support the partition of Germany, or does it advocate preserving a federal or unified Germany?

Answer: The Atlantic Charter stipulates that all peoples should be free to choose the form of government they wish to support. We firmly believe that this principle should also apply to former enemy countries. Any solution that violates this principle will be detrimental to the establishment of lasting peace.

### Envoy Visits Foreign Minister Wang, Also Meets Canadian Ambassador

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Ambassador Stuart and Fu Jingbo visited Foreign Minister Wang and Canadian Ambassador Oudren at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11:15 AM on the 18th for diplomatic courtesy calls, returning at 1:00 PM.

### Wu Tiecheng Leaves Nanjing for Shanghai, Ambassador Stuart Hopes Communists Will Participate in the Five-Person Meeting, Resolving Disputes by Starting with Politics

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] A senior government official told reporters on the 18th that peace talks should come to a conclusion before the end of this month, because there is a "chance" within this period. Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart are making efforts to explore the intentions of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), but the CCP's attitude changes almost daily, and the difficulty lies perhaps in this.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Wu Tiecheng took the night train to Shanghai on the 18th, and it is said that he will have contact with representatives of various parties in Shanghai.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Special Envoy Marshall returned to Nanjing a day ago, and the deep expectations of all parties have been revealed. Ambassador Marshall stated that he still actively hopes that the Communist Party can attend the informal five-person group meeting, because when he went to Lushan eight times, the Communist Party suggested convening a military three-person meeting to first resolve the issue of a ceasefire. Ambassador Marshall discussed this idea with the Chairman, who believed that the informal group meeting was a way to seek a comprehensive ceasefire from a political perspective, and that other matters could be discussed after achieving success in the allocation of seats for members of the National Government Committee. Therefore, Ambassador Marshall informed Ambassador Stuart of this idea during their long talk last night. At 10:30 AM on the 18th, Ambassador Stuart met with Wang Bingnan, and in addition to conveying this intention, he also advised the Communist Party to participate in the five-person group meeting. Wang firmly stated that the Communist Party refused to participate in the talks and insisted on convening a military three-person meeting to discuss a ceasefire. At 5:30 PM, Fu Jingbo visited government representatives Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng to solicit their opinions, returning at 7:00 PM. Furthermore, according to the spokesperson of the Communist Party representatives tonight: "The current situation has reached its most serious stage." Ambassador Stuart stated that the talks are still hopeful and have not reached a final turning point.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] According to authoritative sources: "Generally, people observe the political situation and make inferences from a formal perspective, especially regarding the views on the three-person and five-person meetings. They believe that the current situation is serious, and the war is fierce, so it should start with an immediate ceasefire. In fact, if we broaden our perspective, the Chinese problem is definitely not military but political. Therefore, if we have an unconditional immediate ceasefire, and the political problems are not resolved after the order is issued, domestic disputes will still not be curbed. Therefore, we should focus on addressing the root cause and start from the political aspect." Someone also said: "If we formally discuss national affairs and convene a political consultation conference, then why would the war start again?" Someone also believed: "The Communist Party's refusal to participate in the informal five-person group meeting is like 'refusing to eat because of fear of choking.' If they can participate, there will definitely be achievements, and the goal of a ceasefire will definitely be achieved."

[Central News Agency, Guling, 18th] A night of wind and rain has made the climate of Lushan as cold as midwinter. The reporter mobilized his luggage, and all his clothes were added to his body for support, but he still felt that he was no match for the cold. The Lixing Daily News announced its suspension of publication, and stores on the street closed down one after another. In addition, the emerald green of the mountains has changed, and the bell sounds of the ancient temples have become sparse, all of which symbolize the annual prosperity of Lushan has begun to decline, like the鲜花 (fresh flowers) that once bloomed in the second hour (2:00 AM-4:00 AM), waiting to bloom again next year. In recent days, the only topic of conversation among the mountain people has been the date of departure of the Chairman and his wife from the mountain, and the route of their departure has become the focus of debate.

### Preparations for the National Assembly Are Underway

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] According to Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, told reporters: "The date of the National Assembly is approaching, and we are stepping up preparations to ensure that there are no omissions before the meeting. Regarding the representatives who have not yet been produced, some will be selected and announced by the National Government. Although we have not yet heard that the list of nominees from the various parties has been sent, given their eagerness for the National Assembly to implement constitutional government, they should not delay or affect the convening of the meeting."

On the evening of the 15th, they bombed the Pingwang Power Plant, the auto repair shop outside the East Gate, the engine section water tower of the Yuhe Railway Bridge, and other major buildings. They also carried out extensive burning at Qilicun, Zhoujiadian, Xingguosi, and other places south of the city. The flames were soaring and piercing the sky.

### Foreign Minister Wang Hosts a Tea Party for the Press, Discusses the Experience of Attending the Peace Conference, Peace Treaties with Germany and Japan Can Be Signed Within the Year

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] After attending the Foreign Correspondents' Press Conference of the Central Propaganda Department at 5:00 PM on the 18th, Foreign Minister Wang hosted a tea party at the Foreign Minister's residence, inviting the persons in charge of various newspapers in Nanjing and representatives of various newspapers stationed in Nanjing, to report on the experience of attending the Paris Peace Conference. First, he said: "Although this conference was specifically for negotiating peace treaties with the five Axis satellite countries of Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Finland, in terms of procedures and organization, it was a model for the peace conferences with Germany and Japan, so we cannot but pay attention to it. The organization participating in this conference consisted of 21 countries. Although more countries than this number declared war on the five countries, according to the consultation of the five foreign ministers in December of last year, the number was limited to those who directly participated in the war, hence this limitation. Although we did not participate in the European theater of war, we were able to participate because it was decided by the foreign ministers' meeting and because we are a permanent member of the Security Council. In addition, countries such as Egypt, Iran, and Albania were also allowed to send representatives to attend the conference or make statements at the review committee because the relationships involved were more extensive."

Voting System and Language Consumed the Most Time

After the opening of the conference, the first issue to be resolved was the issue of the chairmanship. The small countries held objections to this point because they did not participate in the drafting of the peace treaty and did not agree with the method of the five countries taking turns as chairman. Some advocated that France, as the host country, should serve as chairman, while the Soviet Union believed that it was different from the United Nations Conference in San Francisco and advocated that the five countries should still take turns. The French side also stated that it would only be willing to allow France to be the host country if everyone unanimously agreed. In the end, it was decided that the five countries would take turns according to the alphabetical order of the names of the countries. Next, he described the order of the meeting, stating: "Regarding the voting at the conference, the foreign ministers' meeting had decided that a two-thirds majority was required for passage. The Soviet side also believed that this was the case when discussing the United Nations Charter, but the small countries felt panic and believed that the passage of the peace treaty would still have to go through the foreign ministers' meeting in the future, so they mostly advocated using a majority voting system. The dispute was quite intense. In the end, because all parties hoped that I would propose a compromise plan, I (Wang referring to himself) proposed that since it was not easy to resolve with a two-thirds majority, and adopting a majority system would often allow too many to abstain when the conference voted, it was advocated that eleven votes should be used as the voting number. The British side also suggested voting in two ways, one using a two-thirds vote and the other using eleven to fourteen votes. Both results were transferred to the foreign ministers' meeting for reference, which was the same in spirit as what I proposed. The meeting time was spent on this for two weeks. As for the languages used at the conference, they were English, French, and Russian. I stated that I reserved the right to add 川中文 (Sichuanese?) to the future peace conference with Japan, because the use of three languages also took up a lot of time during the conference."

Although There Were Many Disputes at the Peace Conference, the Results Were Optimistic

Next, he described the spirit of this peace conference, stating: "Although there were many disputes at the meeting, in view of the lessons learned after the last war and in order to prevent new wars, the results are still optimistic. For example, regarding compensation to Italy, in addition to the British colonies initially demanding compensation of 1.5 billion pounds, they later withdrew the demand. The Soviet side demanded 100 million US dollars, but Britain and the United States both stated that they would not seek compensation and did not want land. Countries such as South Africa and Greece suffered great losses, but they did not make excessive demands. During the Boxer Rebellion, Italy demanded compensation from China for 35 years, and the amount paid was 30 million US dollars. Although we did not directly fight against Italy this time, the indirect damage and impact caused by Italy were great. However, in order to support Italy to embark on the path of democracy, we also did not dwell on past grievances and did not make any demands." Next, he described the issue of Italian colonies, which the foreign ministers' meeting has not yet resolved, but in principle, a decision needs to be made urgently. For example, if we follow the previous League of Nations mandate system, it has failed because it did not set a time limit. In the future, if we follow the United Nations trusteeship system, we should also respect the principle of national self-determination at the same time, so that good results can be achieved in the future. This matter may have to be resolved by the foreign ministers' meeting or the United Nations conference in the future. Finally, he described the prediction of the results of the conference, stating: "Although the situation is constantly changing, it is predicted that the future peace treaties with Germany and Japan can be signed within this year. Although there are many difficulties, if we can recognize the principle of national self-determination and maintain the belief that peace will not be possible if Germany is divided, then everything will be easily resolved. After the signing of this peace treaty, the international atmosphere may change, and we may be able to expect to obtain new conclusions in the future."

### The Situation in Britain Has Changed Greatly in the Past Year

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] After reporting on the experience of attending the peace conference at the tea party, he talked about the situation in Britain, saying: "The situation in Britain has changed greatly in the past year. At this time last year, all parties in Britain, both in and out of the government, lacked confidence in politics and economics. After a year of austerity and hard work, confidence has greatly increased, and the atmosphere has been renewed. Last month, the British government announced that the number of exports had returned to the level of 1939. The Labor Party is in power and is confident that it can reach the path of democratic politics. The attitude towards India is also very different from the past, so the Indian people's feelings towards Britain have also changed greatly." Next, he answered reporters' questions: (1) Is the relationship between Britain and the United States fundamentally contradictory to that of the Soviet Union? Wang replied: "Ideologically, it is so, but I believe it can be overcome in the end." (2) Are we adding foreign tax officials to our customs again due to foreign pressure? Wang replied: "As far as I know, there is no foreign pressure, and this measure is not binding at all." (4) What do you think of Wallace's speech? He replied, "I have nothing to say about this at the moment."

### Chen Cheng Gave a Speech to Military Officers in Beiping, Encouraging Soldiers to Work Hard to Build the Country, and Analyzing the Current Situation

### Five Traitors, Including Zhou Fohai, to be Transferred to the Capital's High Court for Trial

Lin's Wife Files Another Appeal

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] A responsible person from the Capital High Court stated that if the procuratorate can complete the compilation of the files of the five traitors, including Zhou Fohai, in a timely manner, then the traitors may be transferred to the High Court on the 19th.

### Transport Plane Crashes and is Destroyed in the Sky Over Wangting, Suzhou

American Correspondent Dies, Co-pilot Injured

[Our Wuxi Correspondence] The Aviation Corps of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in China, in order to transport various current affairs newsreels produced by China to Taiwan, dispatched Lieutenant Chen Jianshuo of the Chinese Air Force on the afternoon of the 14th, accompanied by U.S. Air Force pilot Krakif and correspondent Weissmeier, in a C54 transport plane (number 2518) from Nanjing to Taiwan. The weather was poor when they took off from Nanjing, but because the aircraft was in good condition and Chen was experienced, they took off despite the bad weather. Unexpectedly, when flying over Zhenjiang, they discovered a mechanical malfunction, so they telegraphed the Nanjing Aviation Corps to report the situation. They planned to land at Changzhou Airport, but Weissmeier believed that the situation was not serious, so they decided to land in Shanghai. At that time, the fog was heavy and visibility was poor. Weissmeier suddenly opened the engine throttle, and air suddenly rushed in, causing a violent explosion in the fuel line. Weissmeier was injured on the spot, and the engine immediately stopped running. Chen notified them to prepare for an emergency landing, and slowly spiraled and glided down, intending to land on the Suzhou-Wuxi Highway. Unexpectedly, two cars were passing by. In order to ensure the safety of the dozens of passengers in the cars, he slightly tilted the fuselage. The tail first hit the foot of a small hill, and then the fuselage landed seven kilometers south of Wangting, Suzhou. The impact was extremely violent, and the aircraft was severely damaged. Chen, having taken appropriate measures, was not injured. Krakif injured his right arm. Weissmeier tragically died on the spot when his forehead violently struck the radio equipment, causing brain matter to spill out. His body was transported to Nanjing by Chen on the 15th. Krakif took a car to Shanghai for treatment and is temporarily staying at the International Hotel. The Nanjing Corps has dispatched a plane to Suzhou to dismantle the damaged plane and transport it to Nanjing. Fortunately, the films were not damaged. The day before yesterday afternoon, Chen took a Paratrooper jeep from Suzhou. On the way, the vehicle fell into a river due to a damaged bridge. Fortunately, the water was shallow, and nearby farmers helped to retrieve the vehicle. He arrived in the city in the evening, visited County Magistrate Xu at the county government, and then took a train to Shanghai, planning to fly to Nanjing to report, it is said.

### Autumn Rain and Bone-Chilling Wind; Shenyang Commemorates the September 18th Incident; Opening of the Joint Sports Meet, Ten Thousands Rejoice

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 18th] For the past fourteen years, the enemy and puppets have held grand celebrations for the September 18th Incident in the Northeast. Although last year marked the recovery, it was a time of war and chaos, and the people were both happy and apprehensive during the Soviet military occupation. Although this year is generally peaceful, there are many reflections on the future of the country. On the eve of the September 18th Incident, a heavy autumn rain suddenly changed the weather, and the wind was bone-chilling, so that it was almost impossible to resist the cold without wearing fur-lined cotton clothing. The first Liaoning Provincial Joint Sports Meet of All Circles was held today at the Jinshan Sports Field in Shenyang (formerly the International Sports Field), which is of great significance. Athletes showed their skills in the cloudy weather. The national flag was fluttering, and ten thousands cheered. People in the Northeast have not seen this scene for fourteen years. There was only a slight level of alert on the streets of Shenyang, and banquets and entertainment were prohibited. At noon, cannons were fired, and the entire city stopped activities to express condolences, with countless emotions.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 18th] Tianjin spent the "September 18th" day in silence. Yesterday, an autumn rain caused the temperature to drop sharply, and the mercury column fell to sixty degrees in the cold wind.

### UNRRA Far East Conference to Review the Transportation of Materials by the Executive Yuan

[Our Report] The UNRRA Far East Conference was held yesterday at the Bank of China building on the fourth floor. Representatives from ten countries, including China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, India, and the Netherlands, attended. The Chinese representative, Jiang Tingfu, served as chairman. Yesterday afternoon, an closed-door group meeting was held at the original site. The Executive Yuan presented various detailed figures related to storage and transportation in the group. The conference will resume at 11:15 this afternoon, and it is expected that this conference can usually conclude today.

The main topics of the conference yesterday were: (1) A review of the transportation of relief materials by the Executive Yuan, (2) The repatriation of various groups of overseas Chinese who were displaced due to the war.

Regarding the transportation of relief materials by the Executive Yuan, US representative Kirkpatrick stated that 25% of UNRRA materials shipped to China were congested in the port of Shanghai. Kirkpatrick said that only 100,000 tons of materials have been transported inland in the past few months. UNRRA plans to allocate 1.5 million tons of materials to China, and if the transportation situation does not improve, it will take 15 months to transport these materials. The request to extend the period for relief in the Far East, as decided by the previous Far East Conference and submitted to the UNRRA General Assembly, has been rejected. All UNRRA work must be completely terminated by the end of June next year. Kirkpatrick asked Egerton, the head of the UNRRA office in China, to explain how to remedy the situation in such a short period.

Egerton immediately replied that under the current difficult circumstances, the work of clearing the port of Shanghai has indeed improved compared to before, and he firmly believes that transportation will be accelerated in the near future. It is unnecessary for UNRRA to reduce its assistance to China because of this.

Egerton then asked Handler, the UNRRA representative participating in the Port Clearing Committee of the Executive Yuan, to report on the port clearing situation. Handler said that the main reason for the slow clearance of warehouses is that some dilapidated and unusable heavy machinery is piled up in them, making transportation difficult. Most of these machines are war surplus materials, and the parts are incomplete and cannot be assembled. Note: Liu Hongsheng, the Executive Director of the Executive Yuan, once stated that he intended to sell these heavy machines at a low price so that the warehouses could be vacated, but there have been no buyers so far.

Regarding the issue of repatriating refugees from various countries, the first proposal was to repatriate overseas Chinese refugees. Sabber, the director of the UNRRA Refugee Repatriation Bureau, said that the repatriation of overseas Chinese refugees will definitely begin by the end of this month, and some Philippine government officials who will arrive in Shanghai soon have promised to fully assist. Ms. Hingde, the British representative, said that the governments of Malaysia and Burma are also willing to conduct "trial voyages" for repatriating overseas Chinese. Sabber continued that 2,099 Austrian refugees residing in China have returned home, and the office has also received a telegram from the European military authorities allowing them to return home, but the German military authorities have not yet made such a statement. The US representative promised to convey their views to the relevant authorities. The Soviet representative Seminas proposed that the US and Soviet military authorities stationed in Korea send representatives to cooperate with UNRRA in handling the repatriation of Korean refugees, which was approved. It was also decided to review the situation of post-war relief in Korea at the next conference. The US representative mentioned the post-war relief in the Philippines, and because the Philippine representative was unable to attend yesterday, the conference decided to "urge" the Philippine representative to attend the next conference.

### The Executive Yuan Agrees to Allocate Equipment to Repair the Hunan-Guangxi and Guizhou-Guangxi Roads

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 18th] The Guilin section of the Hunan-Guangxi Railway and the Liu (zhou)-Nan (dan) section of the Guizhou-Guangxi Road have not been repaired since they were destroyed by the enemy. The Guizhou Provincial Relief and Rescue Committee consulted with the Guizhou Relief and Rescue Sub-Bureau and requested the Executive Yuan to allocate equipment. The Executive Yuan has now approved the request. The committee has telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications, requesting them to immediately instruct the two roads to start repairs.

### The Issue of Hong Kong and Kowloon Should be Divided into Three Parts, a Veteran of the Diplomatic Community Tells Reporters

[Our Report] In recent days, the calls for the recovery of Hong Kong have risen sharply again due to the establishment of administration in Kowloon City by our government, and some people in the Municipal Council have also proposed the demand to recover Hong Kong. This reporter specially visited a veteran of the diplomatic community in this city yesterday, and he shared his personal observations: The issue of Hong Kong and Kowloon should actually be divided into three parts: (1) Kowloon City has always been an important coastal defense area against Japanese pirates in our country. The city is strongly fortified and serves as an implicit strategic point for southern China. There was no explicit provision in the agreements with the British in the past to abandon the sovereignty of Kowloon City, so the establishment of administration by our country this time is not inappropriate. (2) The Kowloon leased territory was stipulated in the Treaty of Beijing in 1898, leased by the British for ninety-nine years. During the Anti-Japanese War, the British government, to show its respect for our country's heroic resistance against Japan, voluntarily returned the concessions in China. In this spirit, all unequal treaties between China and Britain in the past should be abolished; however, there was no precise provision for the handover of the Kowloon leased territory when the new treaty was signed at the time. According to the British interpretation, it seemed to be a tacit recognition of the British lease right over the Kowloon leased territory, and even regarded it as a de facto re-confirmation. However, if the British side truly has the sincerity to enhance British-Chinese friendship, then why not return this area to its original owner ten years earlier? (3) The status of Hong Kong is different from that of the Kowloon leased territory. Hong Kong is a British Crown Colony, directly under the jurisdiction of the British government. The people born in Hong Kong all have British nationality. The British government's foreign policy has always emphasized practical application, with a long-term vision. Sometimes, it is quite willing to make considerable concessions in disputes; however, giving up Hong Kong is equivalent to giving up the Far East. Judging from the current signs, Britain does not seem willing to do this. Recently, a Reuters reporter called the demand to recover Hong Kong a "storm in a teacup", which may be a considerable reflection of the attitude of the general British people towards this.

### Hong Kong Forms Elected Government, British Chamber of Commerce Offers Opinions

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 18th] The Hong Kong British Chamber of Commerce yesterday provided the government with opinions on the organization of the elected government. The powers of the elected government and the qualifications of voters recommended by the Chamber are more restrictive than those broadcast by the Governor of Hong Kong last month. According to the recommendations, foreign affairs, defense, ports, railways, post offices, customs, trade, control, shipping, taxation, financial audit, judicial officers, and police would still be the responsibility of the Royal Government. The elected government would only govern public works, education, health, taxation, and prisons. The elected government would have sixteen members, including six Chinese and ten non-Chinese. Members must have voter qualifications, jury qualifications, and must be recommended by two gentlemen. The voter qualifications stipulate that they must be British nationals who are at least twenty-five years old and must have the ability to pay one hundred yuan in property tax per month. The draft organization of the elected municipal government, broadcast at the end of last month, said that opinions must continue to be collected before a final decision is made. The Hong Kong British Chamber of Commerce is the general group of British businessmen, and its opinions may affect Hong Kong politics.

### British Far East Fleet Commander, Packe, to Arrive in Nanjing Tomorrow

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] British Far East Fleet Commander Packe will arrive in Nanjing at 10:00 AM on the 20th aboard the HMS Black Prince.

He is scheduled to pay respects and lay flowers at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum on the 22nd and leave Nanjing for Shanghai on the 24th.

### Authorities to Thoroughly Investigate Various Corruption Cases in Wuhan

### Hu Mai Sentenced to Ten Years in Prison for Unauthorized Withdrawal of Public Grain

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 18th] Hu Mai, the former director of the Hunan Provincial Field Grain Office, was accused of unauthorized withdrawal of public funds and speculation in grain. After the debate concluded, the Changsha District Court sentenced him today to ten years in prison and deprived him of his civil rights for ten years. Hu's case was originally punishable by death or life imprisonment. According to the presiding judge of the District Court, Hu (1) speculated in grain for the benefit of internal employees, (2) effectively regulated military and public grain in western Hunan during the war, and (3) ensured the supply of military grain during the Western Hunan Battle, so he was sentenced leniently.

### Changchun City Police Bureau Cracks Japanese Secret Organization; Large Scale Planned to Disrupt Our Internal Affairs

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 18th] The Changchun City Police Bureau cracked the Japanese secret organization "Kokusuikai" in Changchun in June. This organization is quite large in scale and attempts to disrupt China's internal affairs in order to rebuild the Japanese Empire. The group's regulations state that "Oto-ko no Taiko (nephew of Marshal Yamamoto), who once served as the leader of the Jehol Expeditionary Force in Great East Asia, was a devil who killed anti-Japanese elements, and his wife, Kobayashi Haru, is quite capable and is one of his accomplices. The case was interrogated when the War Criminals Supervision Group came to Changchun and has been reported to the Military Command."

### Severe Drought and Extreme Heat in Fujian Province; Most of the Late Rice is Withered

Rice Prices in Fuzhou and Xiamen Rise Continuously

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 17th] While the whole country is reporting a bumper harvest, Fujian is experiencing a severe drought due to extreme heat for more than two months from late summer to autumn. Yesterday and the day before yesterday, the indoor temperature here reached 97 degrees Fahrenheit. The extreme heat is even worse today, exceeding 110 degrees. Such extreme heat during the White Dew and Autumn Equinox seasons is unprecedented in decades. At present, the northeastern and western regions of Fujian are in the period of heading and grain filling for late rice, resulting in most of it withering. It is feared that this year's harvest will be less than half. As a result, rice prices in various places are rising daily. Today, white rice in Fuzhou sells for 83,000 yuan per stone, and 110,000 yuan in Xiamen.

### The Various Cannons Required for the Jiangyin Fortress are Being Shipped from Taiwan

[Our Jiangyin Correspondence] In order to speed up the completion of the Huangshan and Xiaoshan forts, the Ministry of National Defense had Director Fu and Staff Officer Hua dispatched to Taiwan last month by Fortress Commander and Chengxi Joint Defense District Commander Kong Qinggui to receive new types of large and small cannons. The procedures have now been completed. Staff Officer Hua returned to Cheng on the 15th and reported to Commander Kong that the large and small cannons had been transferred from Tainan to Keelung. However, due to the lack of truck drivers for transporting the cannons and the fact that the freight exceeds the budget, it is necessary to consult with the Ministry of National Defense. Once the funds and more than forty drivers are settled, the cannons can be transported to Cheng for installation. At that time, if passing through the Xicheng Highway, because the bridges are only limited to a load of five tons, and the cannons weigh eight or nine tons, the bridges must be rebuilt before they can be transported. In addition, the Ministry of National Defense believes that there is a great need for talent in the fortress and recently sent important personnel to Cheng to discuss with Commander Kong the establishment of an artillery school and a fortress artillery training class in Jiangyin, which must be established within a short period of time. The training period will be six months.

### Editorial: Professor Pound's Farewell Advice

Professor Pound, a world authority on law and advisor to our country's Ministry of Judicial Administration, returned to the United States yesterday. He will come to China again next June for a long-term engagement. During his three-month stay in China, Professor Pound conducted a preliminary and comprehensive study of our draft constitution and general legal system. His insights are truly worthy of national attention. Professor Pound is an American and is naturally very familiar with the American constitution and general legal system, having experienced them firsthand. However, as an authority on law, he can liberate himself from his subjective perspective and conduct objective research. Based on his observations and research over the past three months, he has provided us with many valuable opinions. Regarding the "May 5th Draft Constitution," he believes it is a satisfactory legal code. Of course, a constitution is a living thing; its value lies in its growth and development, not in quibbling over the wording of the articles. He said, "Every legal system has its historical and social background. The background of Western legal systems is different from that of China. Transplanting them to China may not be suitable in all cases, and the national conditions should be considered when making choices." These words are truly insightful and brilliant. Based on this viewpoint, he believes that the systems stipulated in the May 5th Draft Constitution are extremely compatible with our national conditions. Professor Pound strongly disagrees with the advocacy by some people in the country that China should adopt a cabinet bicameral system, and this is especially worthy of national consideration.

Regarding the draft constitution, it has been deliberated several times since the "Political Consultative Conference," yet some people still insist on adopting a cabinet bicameral system. This is truly a naive move, merely demonstrating their ignorance. The bicameral cabinet system originated in England, and the result of its evolution is only one power, as our Father of the Nation has long stated. The so-called bicameral system is, in fact, a mere formality. In France, the adoption of the bicameral cabinet system has kept France in political turmoil, never achieving political stability. This system itself is inherently flawed and should not be transplanted to China. Moreover, China has its own national conditions. Even good systems from other countries may not necessarily suit China's national conditions. Therefore, regarding China's political system, the system proposed in the May 5th Draft Constitution is truly the most ideal system, taking into account both foreign precedents and our national conditions. We should not underestimate ourselves and fail to cherish it. As he was about to depart, Professor Pound also specifically pointed out, "China has a wealth of talent. The Chinese people should have self-confidence and not simply imitate other countries." We should especially reflect on these words!

In addition, some people advocate that China should adopt the Anglo-American legal system, abolish the procuratorial system, and replace it with the Anglo-American national attorney system and jury system. Little do they know that this kind of argument is also unsuitable. Professor Pound said, "China has adopted the continental legal system for more than thirty years and should not make too many changes." This is not stubborn conservatism, but rather because a national system that has been in place for a long time should not be changed lightly and recklessly. On the basis of pursuing stability, we should establish China's legal system.

### The Struggle of Two Kinds of Democracy

Nowadays, in the eyes of foreigners, it seems that there are two types of democracy prevailing in the world. Because their nature and systems are fundamentally different, they cause many misunderstandings and disputes everywhere. As a result, many diplomats and politicians can use the confusion of the meaning of the term as a tool for political struggle.

A few days ago, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov publicly attacked British democracy as being democracy of the nineteenth century and Soviet democracy as being democracy of the twentieth century. This newspaper has already pointed out that his speech was astonishing. We are very happy to hear that the most powerful representative of the Soviet Union can clearly distinguish between the two types of "democracy" for the first time! We have recently read many British and American newspapers, most of which attack the Soviet Union as "undemocratic," while Soviet newspapers and broadcasts also attack Britain and the United States as "anti-democratic." We don't understand what they are arguing about.

The distant cause of British democracy is the rise of individual consciousness after the Renaissance, and the near cause is the transformation of philosophical thought since the seventeenth century and the industrial revolution of the eighteenth century. Due to the transformation and revolution of thought and industry, people in Europe urgently needed political freedom. Political freedom includes the most important matters of speech, publication, elections, and taxation. This is the essence of democracy in Britain, the United States, and many other countries in the world today. If a national government deprives the people of these freedoms, in the eyes of the British and Americans, the government of that country cannot be considered democratic. The opposite of democracy is autocracy. In the sense of oppressing the people's freedom, there is no fundamental difference between monarchical autocracy, aristocratic autocracy, and proletarian autocracy. Even if their autocratic motive is for the people, they are still autocratic. At most, they are just ancient "benevolent despotic monarchs."

Soviet democracy originated in the unrest of European socio-economics in the second half of the nineteenth century and the propaganda of Marxist theory. This kind of democracy is actually communism. Its nature is fundamentally different. What it wants to strive for is not political freedom but economic freedom. The system it wants to build is not a parliament in which all parties and factions represent the freedom of the entire people, but a soviet of the proletarian one-party dictatorship. Since it is called a dictatorship, how can it be called democracy? This is just the view of the British and Americans. The Soviet communists, however, believe that they are the most democratic because they are truly serving the people in economic terms.

If we understand these two types of democracy, which have the same name but very different meanings, many domestic and foreign political phenomena will be much clearer. For example, in a recent article by the famous American journalist John Fischer, "People Afraid in the Kremlin," he described many extremely undemocratic phenomena in the Soviet Union. All the power in the Soviet Union is in the hands of fourteen leaders, the political police closely monitor, the people are not allowed to talk to or associate with foreigners, and even when the 1,200 members of the Supreme Soviet meet, there is a political policeman with a gun watching every six steps. The only job of these representatives is to listen to the scheduled speeches and then unanimously express their approval! In terms of news, it is all government propaganda. A political authority told John Fischer that if the United States was truly democratic, it should completely eliminate many newspapers.

Completely eliminating opposing newspapers, forcing people to absolutely obey through terror policies, representatives only raising their hands, political police watching day and night, with the danger of life if they are slightly careless. This is Soviet-style democracy, which is also the democracy that Yan'an is learning, and the democracy that every communist in the world dreams of. Moreover, from the current standpoint of the Soviet government, unless all countries in the world become such democracies (such as Bulgaria, as mentioned by Foreign Minister Molotov), the Soviet Union itself will not feel safe.

What we find most strange is that, on the other hand, the Soviet Union and communists in various countries like to use the meaning of British-style democracy to attack the other side's lack of democracy for the sake of political struggle. This technique of struggle can indeed sometimes mobilize and stimulate some people who do not understand the truth, but it also often makes the Communist Party itself fall into unavoidable contradictions. Because what the Communist Party does itself is one thing, and what it attacks others with is another, so the faults that the Communist Party attacks others for are often the faults that they themselves are ten times worse than others!

But in all fairness, no matter how autocratic the Soviet Union is, there is one point that can still win the sympathy and yearning of most of humanity everywhere, that is, the Soviet Union's full attention to the people's livelihood. Human beings love freedom, but when they lack food and clothing, they can be forced to move to the other extreme, preferring to be oppressed by autocracy rather than watching others enjoy themselves while they starve to death. This abnormal phenomenon is not that the Soviet Union's one-party dictatorship is truly loved by mankind, but that under economic hardship, they cannot but choose the lesser of two evils. If the disciples who learn from the Soviet Union happen to learn the Soviet Union's dictatorship and forget the Soviet Union's attention to people's livelihood, instead forcing the people to be unable to survive and wandering everywhere, then they will be tens of millions of miles away from democracy.

If the best way for the United States to resist communism is for the government to work hard to improve the lives of the masses and prevent economic panic within fifteen years, then the best way for the Chinese central government to resist the Communist Party's secession and internal strife is also none other than to immediately accelerate the implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood. Honestly speaking, even if the national government has not yet implemented constitutional government, it is more democratic than the communist "liberated areas" from Yan'an to northern Jiangsu, and it needs to pay more attention to the people's livelihood. If the Principle of People's Livelihood is not implemented and the people's lives have no way out, then autocracy and Soviet-style democracy will have the opportunity to take advantage of the situation.

### The CCP's Propaganda Tactics

CCP spokesman Wang Bingnan stated to the press the day before yesterday that "if Marshal Ma cannot bring back the government's reply accepting the CCP's request to convene a three-person group meeting after returning to Nanjing from Guling, then there will be no reason to continue negotiations." The implication is that the CCP-KMT negotiations seem to have reached the final stage. Although this is a consistent tactic of the CCP's propaganda and psychological warfare, it is questionable whether the CCP-KMT negotiations, which are about to reach a dead end, can have a breakthrough. However, after Marshal Ma went to Guling and returned to Nanjing, it was reported that the CCP might participate in the five-person group meeting under certain conditions, and Marshal Ma is planning to go to Guling for the ninth time at the end of this week to make a final effort for domestic peace in China, so we do not need to be absolutely pessimistic about the overall situation of peace talks today.

Let us calmly observe where exactly the crux of the situation lies in the transition from stalemate to dormancy. After eight years of arduous resistance against Japan, China has learned its lesson from the pain. Who else wants to see the resurgence of war? Therefore, the desire for peace is the universal psychology of the people across the country, and even within the government, we must devote ourselves to the great cause of revitalizing and building the country in an atmosphere of peace. However, on the part of the CCP, while outwardly claiming to want peace, in reality, it is constantly deploying troops and generals to attack cities and seize land. Regardless of the recent results, whether or not they are beneficial to them, their original intention of expanding their territory at the expense of dismembering China has already been revealed. Since the CCP harbors such bad intentions, how can negotiations with the government yield results? The formation of today's situation is not only within our expectations, but also as the American media, such as The New York Times, said, "The CCP's plot for negotiations is only to gain a respite to revitalize its political struggle." However, the CCP has consistently refused to reflect on itself and instead wants to incite the people to oppose friendly nations that are well-intentioned in assisting our unification and revival, attempting to scare them away. Although this trick has failed, the CCP has not given up on this attempt. Wang Bingnan's remarks are still demanding: (1) the withdrawal of all American troops stationed in China, (2) the cessation of aid to the national government, and (3) the freezing of all surplus materials. According to yesterday's Nanjing telegram from the Associated Press, the capital is rumored to be considering temporarily freezing surplus materials. We suspect that this statement is another flanking propaganda war tactic by the Communist Party. In short, the Communist Party's premeditated intention is to use various methods to isolate the national government, so that the national government has no friendly nations abroad and no friendly parties at home, and then the Communist Party can do whatever it wants.

[This Newspaper Report] Paris, 18th - Broadcasting from Washington: The White House announced this morning that President Truman will meet with Secretary of Commerce Wallace at 8:00 PM today. Authorities believe that Truman's action is proof of resistance to pressure from the State Department and the Army and Navy to demand Wallace's resignation.

[This Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 18th - Broadcasting: Wallace is scheduled to meet with President Truman at 3:30 PM today (2:30 AM on the 19th Shanghai time). According to Associated Press correspondent Wilson's prediction, Wallace has only two paths to follow in the future: one is to remain silent from now on, and the other is to withdraw from the cabinet, because the current cabinet crisis has reached the point of a showdown. Otherwise, Byrnes will inevitably resign.

[This Newspaper Report] Paris, 18th - Broadcasting from Washington: Some sources here believe that President Truman himself will not insist on Wallace's resignation and will probably ask him to stay in his original position. Truman currently has only two paths to follow: (1) ask Wallace to step down, but this move will lead to Truman's failure in the 1948 election; (2) unconditionally accept Wallace's policy and lead the State Department in this political direction, but this is practically impossible because all parties are exerting pressure. According to what Wallace told a representative of Agence France-Presse this morning, Truman will not ask Wallace to resign.

[United Press Washington 17th] According to the White House announcement, Wallace is scheduled to meet with President Truman on Wednesday. This is the first time Wallace and Truman will meet after Wallace made a surprising speech in New York. People generally attach great importance to its development. Some diplomats believe that since Wallace's speech has caused such a major backlash, Truman may privately advise Wallace not to talk about foreign policy in order to avoid infighting within the party and to take into account international relations.

[This Newspaper Report] Paris, 18th - Broadcasting from London: According to "The Standard" foreign affairs commentator Barryman, President Truman may be summoning Byrnes to return to Washington this weekend for discussions.

[This Newspaper Report] Paris, 18th - Broadcasting: Byrnes met with British representative Alexander for an hour today. The US delegation issued a statement saying that Byrnes has not communicated with Truman since the Wallace speech incident. It is known that Byrnes did not express any criticism of Wallace's speech. Diplomatic circles are waiting with concern for the results of Truman's meeting with Wallace today.

[This Newspaper Report] Paris, 18th - Broadcasting from New York: US Secretary of the Navy Forrestal severely criticized Wallace's speech in front of more than a thousand American industrialists and senior naval officials, and praised Byrnes, praising him as a "great American who is dedicated to his country."

[Reuters New York 18th] Secretary of the Navy Forrestal was originally scheduled to deliver a speech at the annual dinner of the Navy Association. The speech稿 had been distributed to the press in advance, but the original plan was suddenly canceled. Forrestal said, "My intentions have changed, and I have decided that it is better to remain silent." Afterwards, a Navy Department spokesman said, "This is entirely Forrestal's own intention, and neither the State Department nor the White House has exerted pressure." Forrestal's explanation further stated, "When returning from Washington, I was at an altitude of 10,000 feet. Thinking deeply about the several atomic storms that have occurred in this city in the past few days, I feel that mentioning any part of the world will definitely have repercussions."

[Agence France-Presse Washington 17th] Acting US Secretary of State Clayton recently met with newspaper reporters, and someone asked, "From where can one learn about American foreign policy?" The acting Secretary of State immediately replied, "President Truman's statements and Secretary of State Byrnes' speeches in Germany are sufficient to indicate American foreign policy. I believe that in the future, all speeches by ministers of various departments that involve foreign policy must be approved by the State Department in advance. This measure does not mean that ministers cannot enjoy freedom of speech, nor does it mean that they may not express any opinions, but it is intended to allow the government to indicate the extent to which it agrees with their opinions."

### Wallace's Letter to the President Published: Advocates a Policy of Appeasement Towards the Soviet Union; A Treaty Should Be Established for Joint Control of Atomic Energy

[United Press Washington 17th] Secretary of Commerce Wallace sent a letter to President Truman on August 23rd, totaling twelve pages, advocating abandoning the atomic energy control plan of US representative Baruch and Deputy Secretary of State Acheson in the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, completely changing American military and foreign policy, and agreeing to the Soviet Union taking reasonable defensive measures to avoid causing a third world war. This letter was publicly released today. It formally declared for the first time that President Truman had invited Stalin to the United States. From this perspective, the content of Wallace's recent speech on American foreign policy in New York had probably already been told to President Truman. In the letter, Wallace made a broad critique of the policies adopted by the State Department, and specifically criticized the following two items: (1) The State Department insisted that if the Soviet Union wanted to obtain loans from the United States, it should first conduct trade negotiations with other countries. (2) International co-management of the Danube River and opposition to defensive engineering projects in the Dardanelles Strait. It is said that if the Soviet Union made a suggestion to internationally co-manage the Suez or Panama Canals and not allow fortifications, we would also feel panic and anger, and the Soviet Union's situation seems to be exactly the same. Wallace probably believes that the United States, because it has atomic bombs, heavy bombers, and unscattered military bases, currently has more power to bargain with others than any other country. It is said that the efforts made by the Soviet Union at this moment are only "slightly improved" compared to the United States.

Eliminating Soviet Fears: Security Can Be Guaranteed

Wallace warned that American decision-makers must know that their current attitude can only lead to two possibilities: (1) a war with the Soviet Union is inevitable; (2) all of humanity will be destroyed in this war. From this perspective, we must take the path of peace. The basic key to improving US-Soviet relations should be to reduce the various reefs that cause the Soviet Union to have fear, doubt, and distrust. We should recognize from a new standpoint what measures the Soviet Union considers necessary to maintain its own security and world peace, and cooperate with it to jointly establish a world order. We should be prepared to express agreement to the Soviet Union's reasonable security guarantees, even if we are seen as "appeasing the Soviet Union." We should not pursue the veto issue of atomic energy control, because this issue is irrelevant and should not be raised at all. We should be prepared to enter into a treaty to allow all countries to jointly control and develop atomic energy. I believe this is a major issue, and judging from the current trend, this issue may be broken and there is no hope of establishing an agreement.

Abandoning Power Politics: Seeking Economic Cooperation

The United States should not make statements at international conferences as if it has been invaded by foreign countries, because the only country that was not destroyed during the war and whose military strength is stronger after the war than before the war is the United States. The United States should cooperate more closely with the Soviet Union in economics and commerce. The issue of the Soviet Union borrowing money from the United States should be viewed from the "economic and commercial standpoint" and should not be mixed with power politics. In addition, trade negotiations should be conducted with the Soviet Union immediately. However, due to the difference between US and Soviet cultures, and the Soviet Union clearly insists on the "exchange" principle in any agreement, it is not easy to reach an agreement with it, but it is not impossible. My suggestion is to change a part of our concept of international issues. We must change our policies immediately.

### The Letter's Publication Went Through Twists and Turns

[United Press Washington 17th] President Truman stopped the publication of Secretary of Commerce Wallace's letter to the president on August 23rd at the last minute. It is said that this letter was written because the president ordered cabinet members to express their opinions on foreign policy. According to the Department of Commerce, the letter was "stolen" from the archives and fell into the hands of a feature writer. Wallace immediately discussed the matter with White House Press Secretary Ross and decided that since the letter had been leaked, it would be better to publish it. Ross told Wallace that he agreed and printed copies for distribution to various newspapers. Ross then spoke to the president and learned that the president did not approve of the publication of this letter, so as not to mislead foreign parties into believing that the president agreed with the contents of this letter. However, the distribution to various newspapers had already begun and could not be recovered. Ross admitted his fault and had nothing to do with Wallace. As for who the feature writer was, the Department of Commerce did not mention his name. However, according to feature writer Pearson, "Unless Wallace's statement points out that the letter that I stole from the Department of Commerce was a Russian letter to President Truman, I will have to sue him for defamation." Pearson also said that he obtained this document "from another source, which has nothing to do with the Department of Commerce, and can be done openly and honestly."

### Differences Between the US and the Soviet Union Should Be Adjusted: Remarks by a US Army Officer

[Central News Agency Washington 17th, Associated Press] Army Department officials said today that although the hope for long-term peace between the United States and the Soviet Union may not be realized as desired, the general fear of an imminent conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union has not been substantiated in the world situation. Responsible officials of the Army Department believe that the speculation that there will be a war in the next five years lacks evidence. The General Staff believes that the widespread fear of war throughout the world is largely due to an unreasonable worry caused by the diplomatic friction that occurred during the creation of peace between the United States and the Soviet Union. The official emphasized that the Soviet Union suffered heavy losses in the Second World War, and historical facts prove that there must be a period of construction and recuperation between the two wars. He also pointed out that the United States and the Soviet Union should adjust their differences before resorting to sanctions.

### Guerrilla Warfare Spreads in Greece; The Government Decides to Conduct a National Sweep; Communist Leaders Arrested and Awaiting Trial on Charges of Incitement

[Agence France-Presse Athens 17th] It is announced here that the Greek cabinet has decided to begin a nationwide sweeping war in the near future. The commanders of the Second and Third Army Corps will order their troops to mobilize, and martial law will be implemented throughout the sweeping area. However, if the cabinet decides to ban the Communist Party, it is not yet the time to do so, so no measures have been taken on this.

[United Press Athens 17th] The war between the Greek army and gendarmes and the guerrillas is becoming increasingly tense throughout the country today. The main battlefield has recently shifted from Macedonia. Two months ago, the governor of the province said that a guerrilla war was taking place on the Thessaly Plain, through which the main traffic artery from Athens to Thessaloniki passes. Rioters planted landmines on highways, destroyed traffic, cut telephone lines, and attacked troops and police.

[Agence France-Presse Athens 17th] Greek Communist leader Zachariadis will be tried in Thessaloniki tomorrow on charges of inciting the people and mutual hatred. The Communist Party headquarters in Athens was searched yesterday, and six people were arrested. The party recently protested against this. Seven Communist leaders in Tripoli and the Peloponnese have also been exiled.

[Agence France-Presse Yugoslavia 17th] Tirana, Albania: On the 13th of this month, five Greek soldiers disguised as women penetrated Albanian territory and then withdrew, apparently continuing to shoot. This proves that Greek fascists are doing everything possible to cause trouble on the Albanian border.

### Egypt Revises Criminal Law: Bans Communist Propaganda

[Associated Press Cairo 18th] The King of Egypt has recently issued an order approving the addition of revised clauses to the criminal law to prevent the spread of communist propaganda in Egypt.

### Security Council Meeting: Soviet Representative Serves as Chairman

[US New Opening Office Success Lake 17th] The United Nations Security Council met today, and Soviet representative Gromyko served as chairman. Continuing to discuss the Ukrainian case against Greece, Gromyko proposed a proposal to stop border incidents between Greece and Albania.

### Discussions in the Senate on the Issue of Reporting Traitors; Tenth Group Completes Review Work; Shen Guanya Attends to Report on the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Industries; Expresses Readiness to Endure Another Scolding

[Our Newspaper's Report] The City Senate held its thirteenth meeting yesterday morning, where the Bureau for the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Industries reported on its work, and senators raised intense questions. In the afternoon, proposals were discussed in groups. Except for the first, second, fourth, and third groups, which had already completed their review, the remaining seven groups also completed their respective reviews, bringing everything to a conclusion. The most heated discussions yesterday were in the third and ninth groups. The former reviewed the mayor's motion to increase taxes and the horse racing issue, while the latter thoroughly reviewed the city government's new half-year budget.

Today's agenda includes the fifteenth meeting in the morning to continue discussing Civil Affairs Proposal No. 15 regarding the reporting of traitors, as well as discussing financial proposals. The sixteenth meeting in the afternoon will discuss industrial, commercial, and economic proposals.

Yesterday morning, the Enemy and Puppet Industries Handling Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui region sent its Secretary-General, Shen Guanya, to attend and report. Mr. Shen said: "Reporting to the Senate is a bitter task because one is subjected to questioning, and questioning is just another form of scolding. I am not afraid of being scolded, so I have come today to attend and report as ordered." Finally, Mr. Shen added: "Although I dare not say that the handling of enemy and puppet industries is unprecedented, it is indeed unparalleled. Since the Qing Dynasty, we have always been defeated, and only others have taken our property. At the beginning of the victory, the Bureau was established hastily, making do with whatever we had. Today, I dare not say that we have achieved success. What should have been done has been done, but there are some areas where I am not satisfied."

Regarding the Bureau's work since October, Mr. Shen reported in categories. It was stated that the Review Committee holds meetings three times a week, and has held over 130 meetings to date, formulating nearly 100 types of regulations and passing over 1,500 motions.

Regarding the receiving and handling of industrial materials: 1,156 wharves and warehouses were handed over by the Jianghai Customs. The Ministry of Economic Affairs received 480 factories in Shanghai. The issue of factory resumption has garnered significant attention from the public, but resumption requires machinery, equipment, and money. Given the Ministry of Economic Affairs' financial difficulties, it has made its best effort to resume factory production. Real estate and furniture are entrusted to the Central Trust Bureau for receipt in accordance with regulations. All enemy and puppet real estate is ordered to be sold. German properties, including the German Fufa Foreign Firm, Bayer Pharmaceuticals, Siemens, etc., are also being dealt with. The work of investigation and seizure is also the most criticized. Approximately 2,500 cases have been handled, and over 30 billion in materials have been seized. The Investigation and Seizure Group ended its work at the end of June and has already issued over 300 million yuan in whistleblower rewards.

Regarding the sale of assets, in accordance with the decree of the Executive Yuan, enemy and puppet industrial materials, except for a portion transferred to relevant agencies, must generally be auctioned and sold for cash. There are three methods of sale: 1) sale at fixed prices or allocation, 2) consignment and price concession, and 3) bidding and auction. The receipts from the handling of enemy and puppet industries up to August 31st total 331,851,282,560.91 national currency, and it is hoped that the total will reach 500 billion by the end of the year. This sum will help balance the amount issued in the Shanghai region, it is said.

A Chorus of Accusations; Endless to the Ears

After Shen Guanya finished his report, oral questions began. The first to take the stage was Zhu Wenqi, who inquired about the handling of yarn and cloth that had been forcibly purchased during the enemy and puppet period. Yarn and cloth merchants who had been requisitioned had requested the Bureau to return them, and this was initially approved, with six merchants even receiving their yarn and cloth. However, the return was suddenly halted. Mr. Zhu asked what attitude the Bureau was taking, and whether it would return the goods or not.

The Bureau has, on the one hand, allocated some factories to manufacturers from the rear, while, on the other hand, promised the original owners of those factories priority purchasing rights. How can you give one daughter to two families?

The Bureau no longer inquires about factories directly taken over by American businesses, but factories belonging to Chinese citizens must go through various handling processes. Why is there a difference in treatment between Chinese and foreigners? All of the Bureau's work is too slow. It can be described with three characters: "cow-like pace." (2) Huang Bingquan inquired about the enemy's purchase of over 400,000 pieces of yarn and cloth, 16 million bolts. How has this been resolved, and to what extent? (3) Chen Baotai inquired: "I do not know this gentleman's honorable name. Please introduce yourself. The Bureau is a temporary postwar agency, and also an agency that exploits the people. The Senate is created by the people and must speak for the people. We demand that the central government abolish the Bureau and have it handled by the municipal government."

(4) Jin Runxiang inquired about cases of forcibly occupied civilian houses. In most cases, the houses have been returned to their original owners in writing only, but they have not actually received them. This is because of "officials protecting each other," and they are unwilling to effectively protect the common people. He cited the example of the Ning Shao Merchant Shipping Company's warehouse, which was occupied by eight armed units, as well as houses occupied by the Ministry of Education and the Police Bureau. He asked if the Bureau's return of occupied houses involves such situations, and whether the Bureau has the authority to order the forcible occupiers to move out. (5) Fei Shusheng inquired: "The Bureau is a labor-intensive and wasteful agency, and the people of Shanghai have suffered greatly. Since the Bureau is a temporary agency, it should clearly receive, clearly handle, and quickly end its work. When will it end? Do the Bureau's staff engage in dereliction of duty when investigating and secretly reporting enemy and puppet property? On the basis of a secret report alone, materials are seized. When requesting a return, the original invoice is demanded? Does Director Liu have original invoices for everything in his home?" (6) Jia Dechao inquired: "The Bureau has sealed off a large number of materials, but some of them are not enemy and puppet property. We have provided ample evidence and requested their return, but you have delayed and ignored us. When they are finally returned, they are empty. Why? To auction off materials, one must go through channels, and they can be obtained at extremely low prices. These so-called channels include dinners, gifts, cash, and gold. Is this true? There is still a large amount of enemy and puppet property in the suburbs that has not been sealed off. Why?" (7) Lu Huimin inquired: "Why do Bureau personnel arbitrarily load and transport sealed enemy and puppet materials?" (8) Wu Zhengjue reported a fact: a certain important factory, founded in 1924 or 1925, had an important invention. The enemy pressured a major shareholder of the factory to sell out, but the shareholder understood the greater good and was not tempted. Eventually, the enemy used coercion and faked a receipt, and the amount taken was less than 4% of the factory's value. After the victory, the factory's shareholders applied to various relevant agencies. After the Bureau sent personnel to investigate, it was decided that the factory's shareholders should have priority in purchasing it. Now it is worth billions of yuan. How can they afford it? They can only sigh at the factory. Did the Bureau thoroughly review the circumstances of the coercion? The factory's shareholders originally intended to appeal to higher authorities, but the Bureau responded: 'Very well, we will confiscate it.' Why?" (9) Gu Jinzao said: "I am not questioning, but providing some facts, which should be given special attention. Currently, the number of people evading asset seizures through various guises is staggering. The Ministry of National Defense is currently retaining some Japanese people, who are concealing large amounts of materials through various forms. They are using Taiwanese, government officials, and generals above the rank of lieutenant general to form companies, using the evaded materials as capital. I hope the Bureau pays attention." (10) Zhu Wende inquired: "Why are people's original documents submitted to the Bureau repeatedly lost? When we ask Bureau personnel, 'What happens if they are lost?', they reply, 'Think of another way.' As for what that way is, it is unspoken." (11) Hou Jiyuan said: "I am not questioning, just asking. Kong Xiangxi's property in Hongkou was auctioned off as enemy property. Currently, Mr. Kong is demanding its return, but the buyer is unwilling, leading to disputes. It has reached the auction stage, but the Bureau has not yet clarified the property rights. What is the reason for this?"

Request for an Appropriation of 900 Million to Conduct Relief Work

The Seventh Review Committee held its fourth meeting and preliminarily resolved all proposals related to social relief and labor. It was decided to merge the social relief and women's relief proposals. This was because, when Chairman Chiang visited Shanghai this spring, the Social Affairs Bureau requested that he allocate 900 million yuan for relief work. The Chairman verbally agreed to contact the Executive Yuan. Later, the Executive Yuan instructed them to apply to the "Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (RRA)." The RRA then instructed them to collect funds from the Shanghai branch, but the Shanghai branch did not have these funds, so the relief funds have not been received to this day. Recently, women's groups petitioned the City Senate to request that the city government allocate funds to conduct women's relief work, also totaling 900 million yuan, and asked for it to be included in the city government's budget. After yesterday's review, it was decided to request 900 million yuan to jointly conduct relief work and submit it to the general assembly for discussion.

Theater Petition

The group also received a six-point petition from the Theater Industry Association: (1) Please reduce the entertainment tax rate; (2) Please prohibit military personnel from causing trouble by watching plays without tickets; (3) Adjust labor-management relations; (4) Please simplify tax payment procedures; (5) Please extend business hours; (6) It is hoped that the authorities can find a way to provide loans for relief. In addition, Wing On Company needs to take back the site of the Tianyunlou Theater for their own use, and the company petitioned the association. These will be reviewed by the Review Committee and then submitted to the general assembly for discussion.

Regarding Public Works and Utilities

The Fifth Group reviewed proposals related to public works and utilities, and yesterday afternoon completed the review of all twenty merged proposals. Regarding the city ferry proposal, Senator Zhong Yuliang explained that the two small steamboats that used to travel between Pudong and Puxi were run by the local government. After the establishment of the National Government, they were taken over by the government. Pudong residents spend a lot of money on the ferry, but the facilities in Pudong are currently simple, and the government should pay more attention to construction. After review, it was decided to request that the city government allocate 1% of the city ferry revenue for the purpose of local projects in Pudong.

The group's discussion on banning rickshaws and pedicabs was also very heated. It was decided to request that the Public Works Bureau set up more public buses, which would naturally eliminate rickshaws and pedicabs. Otherwise, abolishing transportation tools would be even more difficult.

Only Understood Intuitively, Not Expressed in Words; Shen Guanya Responds to Questions

After the questioning came to a close, there was a ten-minute break, after which Shen Guanya gave a concise response. (1) The Executive Yuan will definitely make a decision on the yarn and cloth case in the future. As for the yarn and cloth that has been returned, as far as I can recall, it was to five merchants. This is because the Bureau's Third Group and Legal Advisory Committee initially believed that it should be returned, but the Review Committee decided to overturn the previous decision, so it was canceled. As for the American factory, because the name of the factory was not mentioned, I cannot answer. If the name of the factory can be mentioned, I can respond in writing. Regarding the slow handling of procedures, it is because Shanghai was occupied for eight years, and each case must be thoroughly investigated. If we do not investigate, we will be scolded, so we cannot help but be slow. (2) See previous answer. (3) It is inappropriate to say that the Bureau is an agency that exploits the people. Fortunately, the Investigation Team is here, so it does not matter if you report us. It would be good for the Bureau to be taken over by the municipal government, so that authority can be unified, but this must be decided by the Executive Yuan. (4) Regarding forcible occupation, in the current situation, there is no way to deal with it, and it is inconvenient to say more. Saying more would imply an attack on a certain party. Eighty to ninety percent of the houses received by the Bureau have been occupied. The Bureau can only handle the matter, but has no ability to compel military organs. This point can only be understood intuitively and not expressed in words. Please, Senators, think of a way, and the Bureau will definitely comply.

At this time, Senator Lu Yinchu stood up and said: "Since it can only be understood intuitively and not expressed in words, the Bureau does not need to answer at all." Shen Guanya consulted the chairman, Pan Xinchang, who said that he could change to a written reply.

Deadline for Reporting Traitors Arouses Fierce Debate; General Assembly Continues Discussing Proposals Yesterday

After the question and answer session ended, the discussion continued on Proposals No. 11 to No. 15 of the Civil Affairs category. The discussion of Proposal No. 15, "It is proposed to request the Central Government to set a deadline for thoroughly reporting and eliminating traitors, impose penalties according to law, and publicly and expeditiously try and sentence those traitors who have already been reported or are already in custody, in order to uphold national law and appease popular anger," was the most intense, with the most enthusiastic speeches. Chairman Pan even returned to the senators' seats and asked Vice-Chairman Xu to serve as chairman to explain the case. Chairman Pan said: "This case is of great significance. I have previously consulted lawyers, the Minister of Judicial Administration, prosecutors of the court, and other parties for their opinions. We know that political traitors in Shanghai can be seen at a glance, but how can businessmen in Shanghai not have any relationship with the Japanese in order to do business? Farmers grow grain and cotton, and if the Japanese want it, how can they not sell it to them? Our Shanghai City Senate represents the citizens of Shanghai and cannot disturb the citizens because of this issue. Therefore, there cannot be a time limit for reporting political traitors. There should be a time limit for reporting non-political traitors. We must pay special attention to the fact that setting a time limit for reporting traitors is not a relaxation, but only to urge and intensify the work of reporting traitors, so that everyone can quickly report, and after the deadline, they can no longer report. In short, this case should be discussed carefully."

Before Chairman Pan spoke, Senators Wu Zhengjue, Wang Xianqing, Jiang Huaishu, and Qu Yue all made statements. The main point was that if there is no time limit for reporting traitors, unscrupulous people will often use it to blackmail, causing the people to be uneasy day and night. Qu Yue also believed that the regulations on punishing traitors needed to be revised.

Feng Youzhen agreed with Chairman Pan's opinion and emphasized that the reason for setting a deadline for reporting traitors is that, first, it can intensify the punishment of traitors, and second, it can prevent blackmail and avoid affecting people's lives. Feng disagreed with the first item in the review opinion, "It is proposed to request the Central Government to explicitly stipulate laws and set a deadline for reporting traitors is inappropriate, because it may be difficult to do. It is recommended to change it to 'It is proposed to request the Central Government to explicitly order a deadline for reporting traitors.'"

Jia Dechao suddenly stood up to express his opposition, saying that traitors should never be allowed to raise their heads, so there should be no time limit for reporting. Some also believed that if a time limit is set for reporting traitors, some traitors who are at large abroad will be able to return to the country swaggeringly after the deadline. However, it was replied that no matter where the traitors are now, they can be reported, and the government will issue arrest warrants. They will definitely not be able to escape the law.

Because it was time to adjourn the meeting, and because the case was of great importance, a majority of senators passed a motion to move it to this morning for continued discussion.

Regarding this case, Zhan Wenhu told reporters: "It seems that a proposal should be proposed and passed at the same time as passing this case, that is, the current Senate should officially represent the citizens in making a general report on traitors from all walks of life in Shanghai. If this can be done, then those who support a time limit can take action to express their determination to report traitors, and those who oppose a time limit can use drastic measures to catch all kinds of large and small traitors in the city in one fell swoop to satisfy the people. Moreover, various materials are readily available and it seems that the Bureau for the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Industries can be asked to assist, because each industry has a property owner, and the Bureau must first ascertain who the property owner is when handling enemy and puppet industries. This property owner is either an enemy or a puppet, making them the best foundation for reporting."

Heads of City Government Agencies Should Always Understand the People's Conditions

Civil Affairs Proposal No. 11 proposes that "the mayor and the heads of various agencies under the city government should inspect various suburbs at any time, so as to understand the people's conditions and urge local administration." It was resolved to pass it.

Civil Affairs Proposal No. 12, "Please instruct residents to ensure that children under the age of 14 must wear simple identification tags in case of emergency," was out of concern for children getting lost. Most senators believed that it was not necessary, "It's better to have one less thing!" So it was resolved to withdraw it.

Civil Affairs Proposal No. 13, "In order to propose consulting the municipal government to publish standards for compiling the cost of living index, and how to calculate and compile it," the general assembly resolved to change this case to a written inquiry, asking the municipal government for a written reply.

Housing Lease Management Revised Rules Draft

The Tenth Subcommittee's review of single-line regulations reviewed the "Revised Shanghai Housing Lease Management Rules Draft" throughout the entire afternoon yesterday. The review committee members were mostly legal professionals who deleted, revised, and amended the draft article by article, citing classic texts and historical precedents.

The draft stipulates that all housing disputes should first be "mediated" by the district office. If "mediation" fails, the Housing Lease Management Committee will "mediate." If "mediation" fails, a "ruling" will be made. If the parties do not comply with the "ruling," the public security organs will "enforce" it.

In addition to collecting rent and security deposits, landlords must not collect premium fees and small rents under any name. The security deposit must not exceed the total amount of two months' rent, and the rent must be calculated in national currency. The standard will be determined separately.

Landlords must not arbitrarily terminate the lease. If they refuse to accept the rent without justification, the tenant may submit it to the committee for approval and deposit the monthly rent with the Shanghai City Bank.

Police Affairs Review Completed

The Second Review Committee completed the review of the policy reports and proposals on police affairs at the last subcommittee meeting, and the review opinions have been sent to the General Assembly Secretariat. It was originally planned to re-read and revise this review result once again yesterday afternoon in order to be careful and thorough, but because the original manuscript had been delivered to the Secretariat for printing, it could not be realized. The review committee members chatted for a while at the meeting place and then left.

No Horse Racing in the Urban Area; Preliminary Resolution of the Senate Review

The "horse racing" proposal has been repeatedly discussed in the Third Review Committee without any results. Yesterday afternoon, Lu Shidao, the convener of the Third Group, specially moved this case to the end of the discussion so that everyone would have ample time, but Senator Lu added a sentence, "I hope that today we will, in any case, make a decision on the review opinion of this case." As a result, it was heated again. Opponents still insisted that "it should not create a gambling atmosphere," but some felt that there was no need to see the matter so seriously. In the end, Zhao Dihua, a senator, made three review conclusions based on the three points of the mayor's motion, and also served as a merged review opinion on the eight proposals related to the racecourse. After the review committee passed it, it was submitted to the general assembly for discussion: (1) No horse racing is allowed in the downtown area (the original site of the old racecourse on Tibet Road). (2) Subsidies for charitable causes should be raised by the city government separately. (3) The racecourse site fund should be used by the city government, but the content of the racecourse site is complex, so the city government should conduct a detailed investigation and formulate measures before submitting it to the general assembly for decision. This finally brought a temporary end to this unsolvable problem.

Finance and Land Administration

The Third Group reviewed a total of eleven cases of finance and land administration yesterday. Together with the previous meetings, the group's review of the proposals has been completed. The review report is divided into three groups: finance, land administration, and the Executive Yuan's Housing Allocation Committee for Shanghai Agencies. Each group is responsible for the review by three senators. In addition, ten petitions from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Chemical Raw Materials Industry Association, etc., will also be reviewed by three people in groups before discussing them together at noon today.

Regarding the two motions submitted by the speaker: (1) For the approval of the Provisional Senate's transfer of the Chinese Kuomintang First District Seventh Branch's telegram requesting exemption from rent increases, (2) For the approval of the Provisional Senate's transfer of the 35th year's in-kind payment of field tax in this city. Those that are the same as the proposals reviewed by the group will be handled in combination.

Administrative Expenses to Be Appropriately Reduced; Business Expenses Not to Be Changed

The Ninth Budget Review Committee met yesterday at the City Senate in Fuming Village, Fuxu Road. After the group's review and discussion, it was believed that, based on the principle of downsizing and simplifying administration, the administrative budget should be reduced by 20% according to the original budget. However, the business expenses will not be changed. In addition, the group's senators will no longer receive the 10,000 yuan in transportation expenses issued to each senator by the City Senate in order to reduce the city government's expenditure. At the same time, the police bureau's mounted patrol team is deemed unnecessary and should be abolished. It is heard that the Review Committee plans to increase the city government's budget revenue for the second half of the year by 3 to 4 billion yuan to expand its business.

The budget review will be re-examined by the group's conveners Xu Yongzuo, Li Wenjie, He Yuanming, etc. If necessary, the subcommittee meeting will be held again for discussion.

Pang Jingzhou's Theory of Hygiene; Can Be Done by Just Beating a Gong

Pang Jingzhou, convener of the Eighth Committee for Reviewing Hygiene Proposals, contributed his personal opinions on improving public hygiene to Zhang Wei, Director of the Bureau of Hygiene, at the Review Committee meeting yesterday afternoon. Senator Pang believed that in this time when hygiene needs to be urgently solved, if we want every ignorant person to listen to the instillation of hygienic knowledge, it is both impossible and useless, because hygiene is not a task that can be done by any one agency, but a campaign that requires everyone to participate in and promote its implementation. Therefore, he hoped that the Bureau of Hygiene could launch several hygiene campaigns that are large in scope and simple in method.

For example: First, the "handwashing" campaign. We all know about handwashing in our daily lives, and this campaign will certainly sound laughable, but in fact, if we can urge the children to wash their hands before each meal, the workers after their jobs, and the farmers after planting their fields, then their chances of getting sick can be reduced a lot, and the percentage of infectious diseases can be reduced a lot. "The amount of soap consumption in a country can represent the level of civilization of a country," Senator Fan Shouyuan also agreed.

Second, the "bathing" campaign is the same as the handwashing campaign. People in many remote rural areas are simply baffled by the idea of bathing. This is also something that must be promoted. Third, the infant mortality rate is increasing. We cannot compare with foreign children eating milk, milk powder, and cod liver oil. In fact, children who have enough breast milk are not weaker than those who only eat cod liver oil. Enough breast milk can make babies grow tall and strong. In the fields of Brocade, the fertilization should not use new fertilizer, because if the new fertilizer contains infectious bacteria, it is very dangerous to water it on the vegetables. If we can prepare more furniture and store the manure for two weeks, the bacteria will die. Infectious diseases can be reduced a lot in an invisible way. Elderly farmers know that using old fertilizer can make the vegetables fat, but they do not know that there is also the benefit of reducing infectious diseases. Fifth, fish should be raised next to farmland. Many farmers take the small fish in the pond to eat, which is not right. They all know that frogs are beneficial to rice fields, but they do not know that small fish also have the same advantages. There are several kinds of small fish that love to eat mosquitoes. After eating malaria mosquitoes, malaria can be reduced. There is a small fish in South America called "Gabbaqia" that reproduces very quickly and is very good at eating mosquitoes. If we can get a little bit of fish to spread in the pond, its function is very great.

Finally, Senator Pang said: "These things can be done by having a guarantor take a gong and beat it down, why don't we finish it"!

Discussing Education and Culture Proposals; Unanimously Recommended Increasing Funding; Supervision Should Be Increased on Private School Fees

The Sixth Review Committee's discussions on education and culture proposals were quite heated, but because yesterday was the last subcommittee review, time was very limited, so only the principles of the last few proposals could be decided, and the conveners would prepare detailed review opinions for submission to the general assembly.

Regarding the proposal to request the city government to increase education funding, some argued that it should be increased to 25% of the city government's total funding, while others argued for 30%. The result of the vote was nine to six votes in favor of the 25% recommendation.

There is an excessively high phenomenon in the fees charged by private schools. One of the proposals is to request the municipal government to reduce private school fees and strictly supervise them. During the discussion, some people argued that the words "reduce" should be changed to "stipulate," and some argued that they should be changed to "review." Finally, the original proposal was revised to "Please ask the municipal government to strictly supervise the fees charged by private schools."

The review committee members almost unanimously advocated abolishing "respect for teachers' fees" which is a de facto disguised tuition fee. Everyone spoke out one after another, painfully recounting that the dignity of teachers has been hurt, the parents of students have a bad impression of the school, and that national schools should never charge fees. As for insufficient teacher compensation, another way should be found to increase it. Finally, the proposal was passed that the city government should stipulate that public secondary schools should not charge "respect for teachers' fees" from the next semester onwards, and national schools should not charge tuition fees or any other fees, and that the base salary of teachers should be adjusted and increased in accordance with the treatment of public education personnel.

The other proposals that passed the review were: (1) District guarantee organizations should liaise with the education authorities and be responsible for assisting in promoting national education. (2) Promote radio education to instill knowledge in the people. (3) Women's schools should add courses on obstetrics and gynecology. (4) Practically improve municipal schools at all levels and strictly prohibit principals from holding concurrent positions in accordance with the principal appointment and removal laws. (5) Pay special attention to science education. (6) Promote family education. (7) Request national banks to provide loans for cultural undertakings. (8) Add public libraries, etc.

Resolution Passed Contains Three Points

### United States Should Strengthen Aid to Our National Government: The Argument of "Life Magazine"

The September 2nd issue of the American magazine "Life" published an editorial entitled "China's National Crisis," inferring China's current situation. Its argument is that China will be the prelude to World War III, and the battlefield and decisive battleground. Its words are very insightful. The author, Henry Van Dusen, was in China this summer and exchanged views with Chinese and American people, and deeply knows the current situation of China. Life magazine, with this article as its editorial, can be used as a representative of the magazine's views. The following is a summary of the main points:

Van Dusen said: "China today is encountering a serious national crisis unprecedented since the founding of the Republic of China. Analytically, there are about three points: 1. Economic Dislocation; 2. Civil War; 3. Political Corruption. The above three are mutually cause and effect, economic dislocation is enough to cause political corruption, and Communist activities; political corruption, is enough to cause economic dislocation, and Communist activities; also because Communist activities, the national economic dislocation is more and more unmanageable, the government's prestige is gradually reduced; the government's prestige is gradually reduced, and economic dislocation, and Communist activities, are even more impossible to clean up.

"There is a difficulty in reconciling the question between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party; the Kuomintang regards the current government as orthodox; and the ultimate goal of the Communist Party is to rule the whole of China; after Japan surrendered, the Soviet Union left the Northeast and all the weapons of the Japanese army to the Chinese Communist Party, which made the Chinese problem even more complicated and serious.

"Marshal's special envoy has been running around to mediate between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party for half a year, but with little success. How will today's American foreign policy be determined? The following is based on the current situation, try to analyze.

(1) American foreign policy should focus on the future Third World War, and prepare in advance;

(2) The future Third World War will be a conflict between the Soviet Union and its satellite countries, and the United States, Britain, and Western European countries;

(3) The future Third World War may not break out in Europe or the Near East, but in East Asia; at that time, the United States and the Soviet Union will inevitably have a conflict here; even if the Third World War does not break out in East Asia, the United States and the Soviet Union will inevitably have a career in East Asia; East Asia will also be the place where the Third World War decides victory or defeat;

(4) The future development of the overall situation in China, therefore, should be noted by the United States. If we do not fear reality, North China is actually the front line between the United States and the Soviet Union;

(5) Therefore, the United States must give the Chinese government real assistance today. Fortunately, today's Moscow still regards Europe as its main target, and in the near future, it may not immediately risk a conflict with China or the United States in East Asia.

"Then can the United States withdraw its aid to China? The answer is no; if the United States withdraws its aid, then the Chinese National Government will be forced to lean towards the Soviet Union, which is a great diplomatic threat to the United States.

"Today's China, foreign aid and domestic reform, should be equally emphasized, and one is indispensable. Without foreign aid, domestic reform cannot be achieved; if domestic reform is not achieved, foreign aid is also useless; therefore, the policy of the United States, on the one hand, should give aid to China, on the other hand, it should make the leaders of China responsible for reorganizing domestic affairs."

Van Dusen is a religious leader, and his remarks have nothing to do with the government; nor can they represent all the views of the United States, but his observation. The point of analyzing China's position in the world situation is worthy of attention. If unfortunately, it is said that in the middle, unfortunately, the Third World War must happen; even more unfortunately, the Third World War actually happened in China, and even more unfortunately, China became the main battlefield of the Third World War; and even more unfortunately, China's internal war today, or even the prelude to the Third World War; we try to think about the tragic situation of China's future, what will it be like! Fellow Chinese descendants, if they can take into account the future of China, discard prejudices, and jointly plan for innovation, today's opportunity can still be turned back; if not, then the suffering of 400 million people will be hundreds of times greater than that of Spain in the past. I hope that the people of the country will wake up soon! (Translated by Hu Huanyong)

### Western Newspaper Praises the Municipal Council: Compares it to US State Legislatures

[Our Own Report] According to the English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post", the Shanghai Municipal Council's reviews and inquiries are a "security" mechanism for venting popular pain. A reporter went to observe the progress of the Municipal Council's work today, and how the general municipal councilors perform their duties of planning municipal policies. According to the level of discussion and speeches in the Municipal Council and the demeanor of the general councilors, it is very similar to the state legislatures in the United States. If a US state legislator came to Shanghai to attend the Municipal Council, they would feel comfortable. This morning, the councilors launched the most fierce attack on the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, which also made the reporter believe that if the Chinese people want to learn and practice democracy, the Municipal Council is a very ideal opportunity to manipulate the General Assembly. The performance of the Municipal Council in a week's work is far beyond what people expected. In the past week, even in today's attacks, the councilors have been able to speak freely in a free environment, even if there are criticisms of the government, they are not at all salty. This morning, Mayor Wu also attended, and told reporters during the break: Although the municipal government is inevitably subjected to councilors' criticism from time to time, he is deeply grateful for the atmosphere of free discussion. He believes that if the citizens of Shanghai can learn and practice democracy at the same time, then true democracy will surely be realized in Shanghai.

### Reception and Investigation Team Holds Regular Meeting: Five Councilors Attend and Participate

[Our Own Report] The Municipal Council representatives participating in the Investigation Team, Zhao Junhao, Zhu Xuefan, Ma Junshuo, Wang Jian'e, and He Yuanming, attended the team's regular meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday. The five councilors expressed at the meeting that the representatives are in the position of local public opinion organs, and in terms of work, they hope to focus on cases of local institutions. Moreover, the two councilors among the representatives, Ma Junshuo and Wang Jian'e, are famous lawyers in the city, so the team publicly elected them to pay more attention to cases related to legal matters. After the meeting, the reporter visited Team Leader Zhang and asked about the process of handling confidential cases. According to reports, the goal of the team's investigation work is to "deal with things, not people", although there are also cases where "things" involve "people", but the main object is still to judge whether the "things" are right or wrong. Regarding the work of the team in the past 50 days, it will soon invite people from all walks of life to make a public report. The reporter also asked how he felt about the city's reception work. The team leader replied: "Not satisfied", and believes that the Executive Yuan should bear more responsibility.

The reporter then asked Councilor He Yuanming, who recently went to the team to work, about his opinions on the investigation work. He said: The investigation team is a public opinion institution, and all reception officials who engage in private gain, corruption, and bribery must be investigated one by one. "If the investigation is not clear," we must also be responsible. As for whether the government handles it or not, that is not our business.

Also, any citizen who has suggestions for the investigation work or has reports on corrupt reception and handling matters can send a letter to the Municipal Council to forward it to the team.

### Major Drug Trafficking Case via Air Transport: Main Culprit Arrested

[Our Own Report] The Police Bureau cracked down on a large-scale, well-organized drug trafficking organization by air transport in the middle of last week.

Then, on the 14th, Li Dingguo, Zhang Gengtian, and his wife Zhang Fengpeiying, three Taiwanese, were arrested in No. 54 Yishunli, Baoshan Road, and two packages of morphine weighing sixteen taels were found, worth about 24 million yuan. They also confessed that the person in charge of the organization stationed in Shanghai, Sun Zhicheng, lived at No. 9 Jishenli, Wuchang Road. The police chief Feng of the second section of the Police Bureau led the police to rush there and waited day and night until he was arrested on the 14th, and a secret organ for storing stolen drugs was found there. According to his confession at the police bureau, he was entrusted by Zhang Yiren to be responsible for sales in Shanghai. All the drugs were transported by plane from Tianjin by Li Hongying. Each drug transport used a specially made suitcase with a hidden bottom. It has been carried out six or seven times, and each time the profit can be millions to tens of millions of yuan. Zhang Yiren himself has an uncertain whereabouts, either in Beiping or going to Tianjin.

However, because the Hai Xia steamer had already set sail, a telegram was immediately sent to the Tianjin Bureau, instructing them to refund the excess ticket price to all passengers upon the ship's arrival, and to declare that before the new prices are announced, the prices on all routes will remain the same as the old prices. Additionally, the Hai Xia steamer was delayed for two days because the number of passengers exceeded the limit. The Bureau then arranged for the Hai Yun to transport 200 of the excess passengers. The Hai Yun departed at approximately 4:00 PM yesterday. The Hai Qian steamer is scheduled to sail to Tianjin this morning. The Hai Yong steamer arrived in Shanghai yesterday, and the Bureau has scheduled its reception for this Saturday. The Victory and Hai Yu steamers are scheduled to be received tomorrow.

### Bei Xin Bookstore: Illegally Reproducing Nationally Designated Textbooks; Exposed and Shut Down; Willing to Compensate 10 Million

[Report from this Newspaper] Wu Bingchang, Chairman of the Joint Supply Council of Seven Nationally Designated Primary and Secondary School Textbook Publishers (including Zhengzhong, Commercial Press, Zhonghua, Shijie, Dadong, Kaiming, and Wentong), reported to the Zhabei Police Bureau on the 12th that the Council, under the order of the Ministry of Education, is responsible for printing nationally designated textbooks, and other publishers are not allowed to reproduce them. There is a printing factory at No. 10, Lane 247, Xizang North Road, inside the bamboo fence of the Jimin Hospital, which is privately reproducing the aforementioned nationally designated textbooks. The Branch Bureau Chief Ying Zhichun ordered the Second Section Chief Wang Shou, Police Chief Wang Yingzhou, Wu Qiming, and Tao Rongsheng to rush to the above-mentioned location. On the spot, they confiscated over 200 zinc plates and 31 reams of printed and bound books, including textbooks on Chinese language, general knowledge, arithmetic, civics, national language, history, geography, and nature, covering primary, elementary, and middle school levels. The foreman, Wu Chusheng, was taken to the Bureau for interrogation. According to his confession, the books were reproduced and sold by the Bei Xin Bookstore. The Bookstore's manager, Li Xiaofeng (from Jiangyin), was summoned for questioning. Li directly admitted the fact and stated that the Bookstore's reproduction of the Seven Publishers' Joint Supply Council's books did not begin this year. It started in Lichuang County, Anhui, in 1942, at the request of the local people. The plaintiff accused the Bookstore of infringing on copyright and publication rights. After mediation, the Bei Xin Bookstore appointed its representative, Li Xiaofeng, to contact the Seven Publishers' Joint Supply Council for a settlement, willing to compensate the Council for a loss of 10 million legal tender. All the reproduced textbooks and zinc plates were to be confiscated and destroyed. The plaintiff, considering their relationship as fellow publishers, is requesting the police to withdraw the lawsuit. Therefore, there may be hope for a settlement in this case.

### Workers at Guoguang Dyeing Factory Attacked: One Killed and Two Wounded in Midnight Stabbing

[Report from this Newspaper] At approximately 12:00 AM the night before last, the Guoguang Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 659 Meizhou Road, Yangshupu, Pudong, was operating a night shift. Four workers, Yu Zhongfu (41 years old), Yu Zhonggui (38 years old), Cheng Yuhong (40 years old), and Yunxiong (19 years old), Yu Zhongfu's son, finished work and returned together to their residence, a bungalow on Xinglong Street, Zhangjiabang, Qiqihar Road. The Zhangjiabang area is located in a winding and extremely dark area. When the four men were approaching, they were suddenly ambushed by three or four thugs holding newly sharpened butcher knives. Without explanation, the thugs blocked their way and stabbed Yu Zhonggui in the back with the sharp butcher knife, piercing his chest. Blood gushed out like a spring, and he fell to the ground and died. Yu Zhongfu was also stabbed in the chest, his abdomen was cut open, and his intestines spilled out.

### Mrs. Liu Hangchen's Body: Encoffined Yesterday

Liu Hangchen, publisher of Yishi Daily, and his wife, Chen Yuying, came to Shanghai this spring and stayed at Room 701 of the Jinmen Hotel. Mr. and Mrs. Liu had insomnia and took sleeping pills every night to fall asleep. Initially, all the medications they took were purchased domestically. Recently, a relative of Mrs. Chen returned from the United States and, hearing that the Liu couple suffered from this condition, gifted them American-made sleeping pills. Unexpectedly, Mrs. Chen was unaware of the maximum dosage of the medication. When she went to bed on the evening of the 16th, she took the pills as usual. Soon after, she felt unwell and realized she had made a mistake. She initially tried various methods to induce vomiting, but to no avail. She got up to call Dr. Pang to come for treatment, but her strength was already failing, and she fainted beside the chair. Mr. Liu heard the news and rushed over. He continued to call, but Mrs. Chen could no longer speak. He personally took her to Dahua Hospital. Upon arrival at the hospital, the doctor performed emergency treatment, but ultimately, due to the excessive dosage, it was impossible to save her. She passed away in twenty minutes. Mr. Liu was extremely saddened by the sight. He immediately sent the body to the Wanguo Funeral Home. The body was encoffined at 4:00 PM yesterday and moved to the World Funeral Home at 5:00 PM to be temporarily placed there.

### Central Bank Begins Work to Standardize Banknote Designs

[Report from this Newspaper] This reporter recently interviewed Liang Ping, Director of the Issuance Bureau of the Central Bank, and Tian Fu, Deputy Director, to inquire about the standardization of banknote designs. They stated that the Bank is constantly considering the standardization of banknote designs and the simplification of types. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Bank was limited by manpower and material resources and could only utilize existing paper, ink, and printing equipment. Therefore, the banknotes printed may not have been fully standardized in terms of patterns, paper quality, or types. After the victory, there are now sources for paper quality, printing equipment, ink, and other raw materials, and efforts will be made to improve. Among the more than 20 types of banknotes issued in the past, the inapplicable types have long been discontinued. The banknotes that are already in circulation are withdrawn and discontinued when they are returned. However, this matter cannot be accomplished overnight and will require time to achieve a standardized effect.

### Suspects Arrested Late at Night for Kidnapping a Child and Demanding a Huge Ransom

[Report from this Newspaper] Chen Guifang, a native of Rugao residing at No. 48, Yongfengfang, North Sichuan Road, lost his six-year-old son, Yuanzi, on the 3rd of this month. After searching everywhere, there was no trace of him. On the 11th, he suddenly received an anonymous letter stating that if he could deliver 3 million in cash to the second trash can inside Jiu'an Lane on Ai'erjin Road at 12:00 PM on the 12th, his son would be returned; otherwise, his life would be in danger. Chen reported the letter to the Police Headquarters, which sent Section Chief Feng Qishan, officer Chen Xianrong, and Officer Ding Wenjiang in disguise to wait. It was not until 2:00 AM on the 13th that three suspicious men arrived together. After entering the lane, they repeatedly looked down and examined the second trash can. Seeing this, Feng and the others immediately stepped forward and arrested them. According to their confessions, one was Xu Fugen, 40 years old, from Dinghai, a carbide trader living at No. 6, Lane 409, Anqing Lane, Ai'erjin Road. One was Zhang Wenjin, 18 years old, from Tianjin, an apprentice living at No. 430 Ai'erjin Road. One was Liu Qishi, also known as A Er, 40 years old, from Nantong, a coolie in Jiu'an Lane. They all denied kidnapping and extortion. However, they confessed that they were entrusted by another friend to retrieve a paper package from the trash can. According to the police bureau, in addition to continuing to investigate the fugitive ringleader, the aforementioned three suspects were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday morning.

### Failure to Tear Ticket Corner: Treated as Tax Evasion

[Report from this Newspaper] The Municipal Finance Bureau has recently noted that a small number of theaters do not tear the corners of tickets when viewers enter the theater, but instead send staff to collect the complete tickets near the end of the show. This measure may involve using one ticket twice, creating suspicion of tax evasion. To eliminate tax evasion, the Finance Bureau has stipulated that all entertainment venues must tear the corners of tickets when viewers enter the venue in the future. If it is found that ticket corners are not being torn or that theaters are collecting complete tickets that have been sold, it will be strictly treated as municipal tax evasion. The Finance Bureau hopes for public cooperation in assisting the bureau's supervision and implementation, and viewers are welcome to report any violations. Once verified, the informer will be awarded the corresponding bonus according to the method of reporting tax evasion to provide encouragement.

### Municipal Education Bureau Plans to Improve Secondary Education, Submitting Proposal to the Municipal Council for Approval

The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has drafted a five-year plan to improve secondary education and construct secondary education zones, submitting it to the Municipal Council for approval. The proposal states: Since the invasion of the enemy, Shanghai's education has suffered severe destruction. After the victory, active restoration efforts have been underway. In terms of the number of schools, it is not insignificant. However, regarding their quality, apart from a few schools with self-built and relatively complete campuses and teaching equipment of a basic scale, most schools are renting civilian houses and making do with inadequate facilities, urgently requiring improvement. Regarding secondary education, there are 19 municipal schools and 207 private schools, with nearly 100,000 students enrolled, all youths aged 12 to 18. Their character is not yet fully formed, and their knowledge is limited, making them highly malleable. If they are not provided with excellent education at this time to cultivate their minds, nurture their character, enrich their knowledge, and strengthen their physiques, it would not only be a lifelong disservice but also endanger the nation and its people. The majority of schools have cramped classrooms, insufficient light, polluted air, and excessive noise, with many deficiencies in material conditions. Teachers are merely fulfilling their duties in teaching, and students view schools as temporary lodgings. Supervision and discipline are lax, and the situation is handled perfunctorily, leading to worrying spiritual deficiencies. The urban area is densely populated, and land prices are high, making it especially difficult to raise funds for building school buildings and improving equipment. Moreover, the social customs are decadent and avaricious, and the pervasive influence of the environment deeply affects people. The education provided by schools cannot counteract the assimilation by society, making it exceedingly difficult for students to resist temptations and stand independently. Therefore, if we do not want to cultivate youth, then so be it. However, if we want to cultivate youth who can bear the heavy responsibility of national construction, then it is imperative to improve the current secondary education in Shanghai. To improve the current secondary education in Shanghai, it is essential to create an excellent educational environment for young people. Recognizing this, the Bureau has proposed the construction of four major secondary education zones in the quiet suburbs of the city. A plan has been specifically formulated and is being actively implemented, including: (A) Principles for constructing secondary education zones; (B) Methods for constructing secondary education zones; (C) Steps for constructing secondary education zones; (D) Key points for constructing secondary education zones. The implementation details of each item are explained in great detail.

### Cotton Yarn Distributed at Original Price, Second Batch Still 30,000 Pieces, Textile Construction Matching Yarn Number Missed Again Yesterday, Kuixing and Tiannv Northeast Hot Selling

[This Newspaper] The Yarn Factory Joint Distribution Committee held a regular meeting at 3 PM yesterday afternoon. As a result, 20-count cotton yarn was offered for sale, with the standard amount of 598 pieces for private enterprises, fully allocated according to the application amount. Textile Construction allocated 1373.5 pieces, but the application amount reached more than 6200 pieces. The selling price was based on 400 pounds of 20-count Double Horse, still 1.3 million yuan per piece.

Since the establishment of the joint distribution agency, the first batch of yarn allocation groups totaled 30,000 pieces. As of yesterday, 26,453.5 pieces have been sold and allocated. Currently, the remaining amount is 1,298 pieces for various private factories and 2,248.5 pieces for Textile Construction. After the first batch of group yarn allocation is completed, the second batch of group yarn allocation will be planned, and the total amount may still be 30,000 pieces. Private factories account for about two-thirds, and Textile Construction accounts for about one-third. It is now reported that both parties have expressed agreement in principle, and once the specific decisions are made, they can be implemented.

To Eliminate Scalping Textile Construction Revisions Conditions

According to Wu Weijing, deputy general manager of China Textile Construction Company, speaking to this newspaper's reporter: Textile Construction allocated yarn yesterday, mainly to production factories, and the yarn numbers were not allocated. Textile Construction considered that the previous system of allocating an average of one piece per company was inappropriate. As a result, large production factories still need to buy from outside. As a result of the malpractices, Textile Construction's purchase permits, copper plates, warehouse receipts, and actual yarn have all become chips for market circulation and trading. Even the registration card of the factory's yarn number in Textile Construction has been transferred and accepted. In order to eliminate this malpractice, Textile Construction has decided to strictly screen the manufacturers applying for yarn allocation. Generally based on: (1) the production equipment of each factory; (2) the year of establishment of each factory; (3) the amount of industrial and commercial tax paid. In the future, the priority order and amount of yarn obtained by each factory will be determined based on these conditions.

Textile Construction Yarn Price Slightly Higher Has Three Reasons

Recently, the market trend is that the market price of each yarn produced by Textile Construction seems to be slightly higher than Double Horse. According to Wu's explanation, the reasons are: (1) Double Horse yarn is mostly sold in the Southern Gang, but recently, the ban on the transportation of yarn and cloth to the south has caused the price of Double Horse yarn in Shanghai to fall. (2) Most automatic weaving factories in this city are accustomed to using yarn produced by Textile Construction. (3) The yarn that Textile Construction has opened can be shipped in ten days. The shipping time for each factory in the private sector is not uniform.

Tianjin Gang Massively Scours the Market, Market Price Rises Sharply

Yesterday's yarn market had a surprising surge. Tianjin Gang absorbed a large amount, because the sales in the East Nine Provinces turned smooth, and they favored the Kuixing and Tiannv brands alone. The opening price rose sharply, and both brands reached 1.435 million. However, the selling price of the same weight of distribution goods, such as light-weight Golden Rooster, Dafa, and Double Horse Flying Tiger, was only 1.367 million, and buyers were lacking. By contrast, Kuixing and Tiannv can be said to be extremely lucky, especially since Double Horse did not move in South China, and the price hovered between 1.512 million. The other 20-count brands also rose by 20,000 to 40,000 yuan. Fine yarn and 42-count double yarn have not changed much.

Factories Aggressively Purchase, High-End Grey Cloth Surges

The market price of high-end grey cloth, due to the purchase by a certain factory, Textile Construction's V12-pound fine cloth purchase permit opened yesterday, plus 8,000 yuan, and was continuously snatched up. The Chak Lung fine cloth has not been opened, but the demand for high-end silk-finishing is very strong, so there is this high price. Other non-branded colored balls and non-branded fine cloths still have little rise or fall.

### Stock Trading Gradually Prospering, Brokers May Increase, Bank of Communications Sends Personnel to Handle Settlement Affairs, Wing On Spinning Unit Increased to 5,000 Shares

[This Newspaper] Since the free China Communications banks in Shanghai are responsible for handling stock settlement matters for the stock exchange, the Chinese side has designated Ruan Jiaxian and the Communications side has designated Chen Mutang to work at the institute respectively. At the same time, a batch of staff members were borrowed from the two banks to handle settlement matters at the institute.

It is reported that there are a total of 34 brokers in the second batch waiting to supplement their documents. Once the documents are fully supplemented, they will be submitted to the ministry for review.

After each stock opened yesterday, the initial market price did not fluctuate much, but the asking price in front of the Xingguang trading counter was enthusiastic, the trading was frequent, and many transactions were made. After 11:00, the trading counter of Wing On Spinning and Meyer became active again. Wing On Spinning once fell due to sellers dumping, and the market price once fell, but it turned due to buyers turning strong, and the market price rebounded. Xingguang was booming because a certain bank aggressively entered more than 800,000 shares, and there was a saying of recognizing three and giving two, and the buying sentiment was strong, and the market price has not been weak. Lilian and Huafeng also showed a prosperous trend. After the high-heat stocks were low, there was a good game for a while, and the Guangdong gang initially entered and then exited, so there was a return, but the field cut a lot of greed, and the advance was blocked. There was also the North gang and Qianzhuang gang cutting a lot in the field, and the situation was still tired near noon. Except for small stocks such as Xingguang, all stocks unanimously saw low. The situation was still tired near noon. Except for small stocks such as Xingguang, all stocks unanimously saw low. There was a profit to cover the short near the close, and a slight recovery was reported. Xingguang ended with a top high plate. As a result, compared with the previous receipt, Wing On Spinning rose slightly, Meyer fell slightly, and Xingguang was uniquely beautiful, rising by 10%. Jingfu and Qinxing were also brought up a little. Among the colder stocks, the Silk Industry and Yingfeng Datong fell by half a percent, and the rest rose and fell slightly. Various stocks outside the field also fell slightly.

Overall, yesterday's market was better than before. The total turnover was 5,469,000 shares. Yesterday, the Meyer transaction unit has been increased from 100 shares to 500 shares. It is said that the Wing On Spinning unit will also be increased from 1,000 shares to 5,000 shares.

### Rayon Price Increase Even More Severe, More Than 300,000 Yuan Higher Than the Previous Day

The rise in rayon prices has continued. It has become more and more unstoppable. At 1:00 a.m. yesterday, the opening price of No. 120 Tianqiao Youguang was 3.15 million yuan, up 100,000 yuan at the close. The afternoon was even more chaotic, with the highest shout being 500,000 yuan, and the final result was 450,000 yuan at the close, a sharp increase of more than 300,000 yuan from the previous day. Mixed goods were also followed by Youguang, while semi-gloss was more sluggish, rising by 200,000 yuan. The factory's market situation was stable, and the opening price was 45,000 yuan. The silk goods factory plate was slightly higher, and sales gradually picked up. Huajin crepe was still sluggish, and the price was only 100 yuan weaker than the previous day. Generally, small silk weaving factories were hit by the high price of rayon and will be forced to stop.

### Public Bonds Slightly Higher

Although there were two or three large households who were quite willing to take it, due to the accumulation of sellers, there was still a sense of pressure. Tongbing opened at 2,150 yuan in the morning, and once pulled up to 2,250 yuan. However, due to the conclusion of more scattered, it fell back to 2,100 yuan near the close. As a result, it rose slightly by 30 yuan compared with the previous receipt. A and B fell slightly by 20 yuan, D was slightly better by 30 yuan, and Tung W was flat. The turnover was no less than 4 million yuan in face value.

### Gold and Banknotes Rise and Fall Significantly

The enthusiasm of buyers was reduced yesterday, and they were forced to slightly reduce the morning opening price to about 2.14 million. After opening, it was stable for a while, and pressure was applied. Buyers retreated in the face of difficulty, and since 2.145 million, the selling intention was slightly shared, and the downstream was informed. After 10:00, the central bank allocated 96 strips at a price of 2.13 million, and after that, it hovered between 2.23 million and 2.135 million. It was slightly stable at noon, and in a flash, it fell back to about 2.13 million. It fell to about 2.125 million in the afternoon, and then rose to above 2.13 million when the next-day delivery opened. As a result, it fell slightly by 6,000 compared with the previous receipt. The price of decorative gold was 226,000, and the price of patterned silver and silver yuan was flat. The dark interest rate was still loose, and the interest rate was around 13%. Foreign currencies were still stable. The price of US dollars opened at around 3,370 yuan in the morning, and then gradually decreased from 3,380 due to the small return of the gold price. It fell to 3,355 yuan at noon, and there was a slight improvement in the afternoon, but there was little change. As a result, it fell by 5 yuan compared with the previous receipt. The price of Hong Kong notes was uncertain, and there was a lot of struggle around 700 yuan. As a result, it fell slightly by 5 yuan compared with the previous receipt. The exchange rate of Hong Kong was 693 yuan to 698 yuan, the exchange rate of India was 835 yuan to 840 yuan, and the exchange rate of the UK was 11,000 yuan to 11,200 yuan.

### Sugar Price Review Committee Decides to Reduce Sugar Price by 10,000

The sugar price yesterday decided to reduce the price of medium sand and raw sand by 10,000 yuan each, and the rest remained at the original plate.

Yesterday's sugar market was as soft as before, with medium sand white falling slightly by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, to 147,000 to 5,000 yuan. Raw sand was 114,500 yuan, ordinary green sugar was 415,000 yuan, and the Ding Qing Tai Wu round arrived.

### Flour Mills Shutting Down One After Another, Cost 20,000 Yuan per Bag, Market Price Currently Only Selling for 14,000 Yuan, No Hope for Relaxation, Association to Hold Meeting Tomorrow

[This Newspaper] Due to high wheat prices recently, the market price per dan reached about 23,000 yuan. And wages are expensive, resulting in a flour manufacturing cost of 20,000 yuan per bag. However, the market price per bag is only 14,000 yuan. As a result of production, all reported losses. However, on the one hand, the export of flour is banned. Therefore, although Guangdong, Fujian, Qingdao and other places need flour urgently, the market price per bag ranges from 25,000 yuan to 30,000 yuan, it is still impossible to obtain flour from this city. The original flour exporters in various places abandoned flour and took wheat. As a result, small and medium-sized flour factories along the Jinghu line have been closed one after another. According to the reporter's investigation, the closed factories are Xin Kang and Jiangnan in this city, Shunfeng in Wuxi, and Wufeng in Kunshan. There are five factories in Suzhou, including Wufeng, Yu Yu, Hefeng, Mainland, and Gongxing. In addition, although large flour mills are still open at present, most of them are milling flour on behalf of the joint head office. The income from the industrial bank can offset two-thirds of the regular expenses, so it can still be maintained reluctantly. However, if the current unfavorable situation of the flour industry continues, large flour mills will have to close down. It is now reported that the Fourth District Flour Industry Association (including the flour industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces and Beijing and Shanghai) will hold a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow to discuss rescue measures.

### Big Players Acquire Yinglian, Foreign Stock Market Improves

Although the foreign stock market is still weak, Yinglian suddenly has a big player buying a lot, and with this help, it immediately rebounded. The big stocks were also brought up, but the small stocks still have little new buying activity and are still unsustainable. As a result, Yinglian rose by half a percent compared with the previous receipt, and Yisha Huidefeng Yeguang rose slightly. The steel and shipping industries were flat, Yibei and Paper fell slightly, and Xiangtai was still searching for more, which was extremely stable.

### Bituminous Coal Blocks Are Firm

The market price of bituminous coal screened blocks is gradually firm because the Coal Business Joint Business Office received a verbal notice from the Distribution Department of the Fuel Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to temporarily suspend the allocation of bituminous coal blocks to the wharves in Pudong, and the quality of the Kaiping train screened blocks of the Kaiping Huoche Coal Wharf on Maigen Road in Puxi is inferior. The market price of bituminous coal chips is still flat. Since the price of white coal screened blocks has risen, the sales are quite inferior. The market situation of Hongji white coal chips is slightly tight.

### Shanghai Municipal Bank Launches Handicraft Loans, 2 Million per Household, 5% Interest Rate

[This Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Bank has been serving the citizens, and has successively launched municipal public pawnshop loans and education loans. Recently, there are a large number of small-scale family handicrafts. Most of these handicrafts have short capital and a narrow scope. The special launch of family industrial loans is to provide assistance. The application procedures are as simple as possible, and its regulations and attached documents have been submitted to the municipal government for approval. All legitimate small-scale family industries with fixed addresses and handicraft equipment that have joined the trade association can apply to the bank for a loan. The amount is up to 2 million yuan per household, the interest rate is tentatively set at 5% per month, and repayment in installments is allowed according to the regulations. The bank is actively preparing for this loan, and it will be opened as soon as it is ready.

### Negotiating Short-Term Sterling Exchange Rates to Eliminate Risks for Exporters

In addition to purchasing and processing packing loans, the Central Bank has recently been handling matters related to establishing effective short-term British pound exchange rates to support exporters. For foreign exchange transactions outside the British pound bloc, the bank will act as a backstop to avoid the impact of drastic increases and decreases in foreign exchange rates. The methods are as follows: (1) Exporters who intend to transport export goods to countries in the British pound bloc for trading may first determine a reasonable foreign exchange rate, which will become effective after being approved by the Central Bank. Once the foreign transaction is completed, if the foreign exchange rate falls, the Central Bank will provide compensation according to the difference. (2) The time limit is one week. (3) Only genuine exporters are eligible. According to the person in charge of the bank speaking to reporters: This bank will spare no effort to support the export business, and will try to realize anything that is beneficial to exporters. Except for the US dollar, the fluctuation of other foreign exchange rates changes greatly within a few days. Moreover, due to the slow communication of telegrams, exporters often suffer unexpected losses. In view of this, the bank has specially sought remedial measures. All exporters who negotiate a foreign exchange contract price in advance within the prescribed validity period can freely handle the profits if the foreign exchange rises after the transaction is successful, and the prior agreement is invalid. If the foreign exchange falls, the bank will compensate for the difference, so exporters can avoid losses from sharp falls in foreign exchange rates. It is expected that foreign telegram exchanges and transactions can be resolved within a week at most, so the validity period is one week. The targets are exporters of tung oil, bristles, silk, tea, etc., and those who are not genuine will be rejected.

### Rice Market Stabilizes, Wheat Prices Rise Accordingly; Oil Prices Fall Below Review Price

Yesterday morning, the rice market was firm, but continuous arrivals totaled more than 7,000 stones. The market weakened at the close, and the result was relatively stable compared to yesterday's japonica rice, as was indica rice. High-quality Baiyuan and Xinyuan rice had some scattered transactions, still falling by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Medium and low-quality rice was ignored. Flour sales were brisk, continuing to rise by more than 100 yuan. Nanyang wheat sales were smooth, rebounding by 600 to 700 yuan. Northern white wheat sales were sluggish, but stocks were low, and prices remained strong. Wheat bran continued to fall by 200 to 300 yuan. Vegetable oil prices rebounded, with all oils falling below the review price. Retail and wholesale sales were not strong, and the trend was temporarily stable. Soybean sales in this city and other ports were weak, and medium and low-quality beans still had few transactions. Corn fell by another 1,000 yuan. Yellow velvet beans from Hankou arrived in large quantities, falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Raw peanuts recovered after weakening, rebounding by 1,000 yuan.

### New Longans Continue to Arrive

Yesterday, new longans from Quanzhou, Tong'an, and other places continued to arrive. The higher prices were 275,000 to 280,000 yuan, followed by 260,000 to 270,000 yuan, 255,000 yuan, 195,000 yuan for Zhongqiao longans, and 160,000 yuan for old stock.

### Too Few Barges, Traffic Obstruction; Tianjin Trade Has Not Returned to Its Former State

Although Grain Prices Are High, Wages Are Cheaper Than in Shanghai

According to a gentleman from the financial community in this city who recently returned to Shanghai from Tianjin, the situation of export materials in Tianjin is as follows: Pig bristles are now in the first place, and are a major export from our country. Other exports include hides, straw braid, carpets, casings, etc. Walnuts, almonds, and medicinal materials are transported in small quantities. As for wool and eggs, which used to occupy an important position in North China's exports, they are now in short supply due to traffic obstruction between Tianjin and the mainland. In addition, the washing and packing of wool and the steaming of eggs, as well as various equipment and factory buildings, have not yet recovered, so they are far from the pre-war standard. However, people in all industries are preparing. Once traffic resumes and goods arrive, the former situation will gradually recover.

The general economic situation in North China is actually better than in Shanghai. Although food prices are higher than in Shanghai, wages are cheaper than in Shanghai. This is very beneficial to export trade. In the financial sector, there is also a feeling of capital shortage. Therefore, the money market is very tight, and the underground interest rate has reached between 10% and 20%. However, speculative psychology is not as strong as in Shanghai. Therefore, the financial market is relatively stable.

The biggest obstacles to Tianjin's trade at present are nothing more than two points: (1) There is a shortage of barges in the port, and ships arriving from overseas cannot be unloaded on schedule. (2) Poor traffic in the mainland affects the transportation of export materials from various places to Tianjin. Fortunately, the construction of the new port is underway, and the initial equipment will be completed soon. Ships of 2,000 to 3,000 tons can pass smoothly and dock directly at Tianjin Wharf. At that time, at least the transshipment of goods can restore the past situation. In addition, if traffic and public security in the mainland can gradually improve, the entire export trade of North China will occupy an important position in the country's foreign trade.

### Wenzhou Old Red Tea Rises Sharply

The domestic sales of black and green tea are still active in the shops and tea houses on this street and in the Suzhou-Wuxi area, and the demand for Wenzhou old Mao red tea is particularly strong. The owners have raised prices again, and the market has repeatedly broken records, reaching 70,000 yuan per dan, a sharp increase of more than 10,000 yuan compared to the previous price. Dadechang Tea Company absorbed 50 dan, which was sold by Yilong Tea Warehouse. Other varieties are consistently firm.

### Taiwan Rice Arrives in Shanghai for the First Time, Along with a Large Batch of Sugar

[Report from this newspaper] Taiwan sugar and rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday, all shipped from Keelung by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Ning wheel. The goods that arrived in Shanghai yesterday included 61,666 bags of sugar and 18,333 bags of white rice. The sugar reserves in this city have increased again. It is the first time that Taiwan rice has been transported to Shanghai. The goods are being unloaded at floating buoys No. 39 and 40. In addition, 3,000 pieces of soybean cake and 615 barrels of tobacco leaves transported from Tianjin by the Zhixin wheel also arrived yesterday.

### German Loans for Export

[Reuter's Stutgart, 17th] In the near future, Germany will be able to export toys, high-end gold and silver jewelry, glassware, and exquisite porcelain. These items are all produced in southern Germany and enjoyed a great reputation in foreign markets before the war.

### Three Sheep Brand Thermos Bottles: The Bottoms Won't Rust

The Three Sheep brand thermos bottles produced by Zhongxing Thermos Bottle Factory. The mouth of the bottle is protected by a double rubber ring. The bottom of the bottle is made of copper screws, covered with a rubber top and bottom support. It is said that the bottom of the bottle can be guaranteed to be free from rust for a long time.

### Is It Reasonable to Increase Payments for Pre-War Deposits? (Part 2)

— Xie Tingxin

2.  Disconnect from the Very Period Excessive Profit Tax Ordinance and Income Tax Law. The judgment stated that "banks have greatly increased the amount of their currency in other aspects of investment." Even if the bank's surplus from investments other than government bonds and loans suddenly increases, the bank's expenses also increase due to rising prices. The bank's expenses are also generated by handling the affairs of depositors, which is also a legitimate cost. If the bank still has a huge surplus after deducting expenses, the state must collect a considerable amount of income tax and excessive profit tax on this surplus. A portion of the "increased amount of currency invested by banks in other aspects" has already been attributed to the state. Moreover, the Income Tax Law and the Excessive Profit Tax Ordinance do not stipulate that reserves must be set aside for pre-war debts, surpluses must be retained, and a portion must be eliminated. In other words, the legislative aspect has tacitly recognized that the currency value increased by the bank's investment in other aspects is the bank's own surplus, without any debt portion, and imposed the prescribed tax rate to be included in the national treasury. If depositors must calculate the loss of currency value, the bank will inevitably re-cancel the final accounts of the past eight years, and the state will refund the income tax and excessive profit tax levied on the bank, starting from scratch, so that the matter can be fair. However, the Income Tax Law, etc., were also passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated and implemented by the National Government, which cannot be easily changed. This is the second point neglected in the judgment.

In terms of the matter

3.  Whether depositors bear the loss of bank operations. The main reason for the bank to compensate thousands of times is that the bank "greatly increased its currency value." Conversely, if the bank greatly reduces its currency value, can the bank reduce the payment to depositors? If the bank's surplus can affect the amount of depositors' deposits, the depositors are no different from shareholders of the bank, and the bank will settle the profit and loss every day so as to settle accounts with depositors every day. The same amount of deposits, deposited in banks A and B, will increase and decrease differently due to the different operating results of the two banks. And it may be completely destroyed and unable to sue the bank. The rights and obligations of depositors to the bank must be balanced, and we cannot only focus on rights and ignore obligations in the opposite situation. This is the third point neglected in the judgment.

4.  The impossibility of payment according to currency value. The change in currency value is not only true during the war, but it has never been the same for two years, two months, or two days before the war. The difference between peacetime and wartime is only a difference in degree. Banks have fixed deposits due every day, and they will inevitably pay different amounts every day. Banks have become a currency value insurance company, similar to the "price index group insurance" recently established by the Central Trust Bureau. However, the deposit contract accepted by depositors does not specify the payment of the currency value index, and the laws and regulations followed by the bank's operation and the national laws do not have provisions for the bank to protect the currency value. After the currency value has fallen sharply, to order the bank to bear its sole responsibility, how can it be said to be fair! Furthermore, the government has now stopped issuing banknotes since July and is trying to suppress prices and gold prices. If the situation develops and the measures are appropriate and the currency value gradually increases, the bank may also file a lawsuit against depositors in a few years to reduce the payment of deposits a few years ago, also on the grounds that "it is neither the responsibility of the plaintiff nor could the plaintiff foresee it at that time." According to the aforementioned regulations and the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan, depositors will also undoubtedly lose the lawsuit. If this cycle continues, the economic society will never have peace, and the bank will only be engaged in litigation. This is the fourth point neglected in the judgment.

In short, our country has suffered so much from this great change, and there are countless victims, and there are also many who have made a fortune in the national crisis. The recovery of the currency value of bank deposits is only a very small part of the liquidation, and it is a fallacy to target the bank as the object of liquidation, and it will lead the economic society to a state of chaos. The liquidation of the past that cannot be liquidated is of no help to the construction of the economic society in the future. Recently, I heard that the government is drafting a compromise plan for the payment of pre-war deposits. I sincerely hope that it can consider it carefully and take care of all aspects, especially the points raised in this article, and pay attention to them. (End)

### The Investigation Is Not Appeasement: The Amazing Masterpiece of the Taiwan Provincial Investigation Team

— Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun

A line of people including Head of the Fujian-Taiwan Region Enemy and Pseudo Industry Reception and Investigation Team, Liu Wendao, has been in Taiwan for over 40 days. They have successively conducted on-site investigations of various production units in the provincial capital, Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung, and listened to the opinions of the people. Recently, the results of the team's secret investigation have been silent. A Taipei newspaper said that it was not investigation but appeasement, while a Shanghai newspaper, based on a speech in a public office, commented as "eulogizing and praising merits." However, at a reception for reporters at 3 pm on the 12th before his departure, a violent bomb was dropped: Officially announcing the public punishment of Yu Baixi and Ren Weijun, the two bureau chiefs of the Monopoly Bureau and the Trade Bureau, and transferring them to the court. This shows that Mr. Liu, with a cautious and compassionate attitude, delivered a sensational masterpiece, proving that the team was not appeasing.

Reporting Two Bureau Chiefs

Monopoly and trade are special names for specialization in this province. Because of the particularity of the business, they also represent the particularity of Taiwan Province. The two agencies have been controversial due to insufficient personnel and technology. This time, the two bureau chiefs were reported by the investigation team. According to Head Liu, whether or not the persons in charge should be guilty should be judged by law. And he further revealed that the inside story of the case is that the Monopoly Bureau underreported 500 million tons of salt, and the Trade Bureau underreported more than 30 kinds of large quantities of received materials. He particularly solemnly stated that the investigation is not only aimed at the two bureaus, but the two bureaus have obtained concrete evidence. They used almost the same method as in Shanghai, first openly soliciting confidential reports, then obtaining written reports on the reception from relevant agencies, and finding contradictions in the comparison, and using the reports as the most powerful evidence.

Requesting Public Opinion Support

Head Liu sternly and passionately clarified the team's position, vigorously explaining that there is no need to obtain understanding or even flattery from the local authorities. If there are any special opinions on this, it fundamentally denies Mr. Liu's character. Within 40 days, a total of 384 documents were received. Some of them involve civil disputes and minor disputes handed over to the chief's office for processing. All case files must be taken to the joint secretariat in the capital to continue receiving and continue processing, and personnel will be sent to Taiwan for on-site investigation when necessary. He said: Whether the local government handles it or not, and how well it does it, needs public opinion support. Public opinion has more power than military, political, and economic power!

Special Circumstances of Reception

Committee Member Zheng Kuiyi and other members pointed out that the difference between Taiwan's reception and the domestic one is that the land belongs to an isolated island. Unified reception is prone to corruption in the initial chaotic moment. After this period, it is watched by the people of the province, so it is obviously impossible to hide a large amount of materials. He praised Chief Chen's integrity, and the command headquarters detained more than a dozen people, including the major general chief, and the court also arrested several people. They were all handled before and after the investigation team came to Taiwan. When reporters asked how many people the investigation team had detained, Head Liu remained silent. He said that as of now, only a few people.

He deeply regretted those who deliberately misinterpreted his speech, but he said that misunderstandings occurred due to language barriers, and it was reasonable to be scolded. It was decided on the 14th of this month to return to Shanghai and then to Beijing. Before leaving, he kept secrets from reporters. The team did not encounter resistance in its work in Taiwan, but he did not want to cause more trouble before leaving to avoid accidents. Head Liu and his party have achieved results in their hard work, and he has a compassionate heart for corrupt people.

Medical and Health

(1) Red Patches All Over the Body

Fang Yuanmin asked: My father is 54 years old this year. He fell ill at the age of 41. At first, his feet were swollen, similar to athlete's foot, and his steps were heavy. Because he took Liuwei pills and goose onion grass, he developed red patches all over his body, limbs, head, and face, which were very itchy and numb. The patches spread and expanded. After being treated by many doctors, the treatment was ineffective. His body became weaker, and his stomach was windy and often made noises. Later, he came to Shanghai from Shantou, and felt more and more unsupported due to the cold climate. He had a lot of phlegm, his muscles were thin, his muscles and bones were stiff, his fingers could not be straightened, and he could not see things clearly with his eyes. What treatment is available?

[Answer from Dr. Zhang Zhongming] Your father's illness should first be tested for stool, urine, and blood to determine the treatment plan.

(2) Red Spots on the Tongue

Zhang Jianyi asked: I don't know when, many red spots the size of mung beans appeared on the back of my tongue.

### Establishing Craft Factories to Take in Beggars

Dear Editor, recently, I have investigated the area from Xujiahui to Middle Lin Sen Road in the city, and there are many beggars along the way, especially in the small vegetable market. Sometimes they steal things and randomly grab vegetables and leave. Most of the people who are robbed, when they return home, find that their things have been stolen, and they curse a few words, and that's it. If they are sent out by the owner to purchase, there is a risk of being scolded and beaten. Under this bad phenomenon, the relevant authorities should be asked to take in these vagrants as much as possible or expel them from the country. The best way is to establish a vagrant craft factory to teach them the simplest small crafts. On the one hand, it can improve the city's appearance and make it look better for foreigners. On the other hand, it can promote the progress of small industries. How appropriate! However, the funding for establishing it is quite large, and the cooperation of the city's large merchants and philanthropists with the government is required to have a successful hope. I am a worker and have no power to do so. I can only express my sincere opinion to the public, hoping that the authorities will adopt it, which is also a blessing for society. (Kong Yunda)

### Taking Radical Measures Against Hawkers

Editor: The section of South Shanxi Road (from Tianjin Road to Ningbo Road) is full of hawkers. After the police station ordered a crackdown, they rebounded in less than three days and remained as before. I really don't know what the relevant authorities think. Where is the dignity of the clear order? Moreover, this road is a concentrated point of commerce, a gathering place for money, and vehicles are frequent, often causing traffic jams, which is very inconvenient for pedestrians. The business of roadside stores is greatly affected. In addition, vegetable scraps and residues are piled up all over the ground, which is especially unhygienic and damages the city's appearance. I hope the authorities will resolutely take radical measures. (Shou Ding)

### Please Prohibit Clothing Stores from Selling Loudly at Night

Editor: There are fifty clothing stores, large and small, on Shilu in this city. They have always had the bad habit of selling loudly. Several months ago, they were ordered by the authorities to be prohibited. Recently, several small stores have defied the law and rebounded. They are still selling loudly, and even at eight or nine o'clock in the evening, this sound can still be heard, which not only violates the authorities' ban, but also disturbs public sleep. (Ye Dexin)

### Taking Action Against Scalpers at Movie Theaters

Editor: There are very few places for legitimate entertainment in Shanghai, so everyone uses watching movies as a pastime. However, scalpers have monopolized all movie tickets. I sincerely point out that several large movie theaters can really be said to be scalpers' nests. They sell tickets openly in the theater, bargaining calmly. Even when I don't buy his ticket, he still makes an abominable counter-proposal. Sometimes they also talk and talk with the staff in the theater. I don't know how many moviegoers are running around and suffering because of this group of scalpers! The black market is a legacy of the Japanese rule, and we must eliminate it. I now propose three points, and I respectfully ask the security authorities to consider implementing them: (1) The authorities should order plainclothes officers to go to the theater, and it is easy to investigate this group of scalpers. With the supervision of the authorities, scalpers cannot sell a large number of tickets in their pockets. (2) Order each theater to post a notice prohibiting viewers from buying black market tickets (this was originally there, but it has now been torn off). (3) If the staff in the theater collude with the scalpers, the movie theater supervisor should be responsible for investigating and handling the matter. All the viewers in Shanghai's movie theaters can prove everything mentioned above is not a lie. Perhaps the municipal authorities themselves have suffered from scalpers when watching movies, but why do they turn a blind eye? (A Student of St. John's)

### Ordinary Education in a Free Society

— Shen Youqian

Report of the Harvard University Committee (General Education in a Free Society) Published by Harvard University in 1945, 267 pages, US$2.00

In the United States in 1870, there were only 80,000 secondary school students and 60,000 university students nationwide. By 1940, there were as many as seven million secondary school students and 1.5 million university students. (In addition, there were one million students in non-full-time vocational schools and supplementary schools.) In these seventy years, the population of the United States has only increased threefold, while the number of university students has increased nearly thirtyfold, and the number of secondary school students has increased nearly ninetyfold. This quantitative increase is accompanied by qualitative changes. To meet the different needs of various students, schools have had to change their curricula and greatly increase the types and numbers of subjects. Because local conditions are different (for example, the average annual salary of teachers in Mississippi is 559 yuan, while in New York State it is 2,604 yuan, a difference of nearly five times), students have different abilities (for example, a smart 13-year-old child can be compared to an average 16-year-old child, while a backward one is only equivalent to an average 10-year-old child, a difference of up to six years), different family backgrounds, different outlooks, and different interests, this development of departmentalized elective courses is inevitable and must continue to exist in the future, but it inevitably produces two dangers: one is that students inevitably become isolated from each other, and the other is that it is not easy for students to integrate what they have learned. Therefore, Harvard University, which pioneered the elective course system, specially formed a committee, hired twelve professors, and spent three years and 60,000 US dollars, hoping to find a common, consistent, and coherent general center in the ever-changing curriculum. This book is the report of this committee.

The book suggests that in the four years of secondary school (according to the Chinese secondary school system, which is divided into three years for junior high school and three years for senior high school, originally copied from the United States, but the American school system does not emphasize uniformity, and the 3-3 system has been popular in China for a long time, but it has not yet been nationally adopted in the United States, so the book refers to the old four-year secondary school system), general education should account for more than half. Three-eighths of the half should be in the humanities, three-eighths should be in the natural sciences, and two-eighths should be in the social sciences. A portion of the remaining half of the curriculum should also be in general education. For students who do not plan to go to university, each of the three subjects of humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences should account for another one-eighth, while students who plan to go to university should have further research in at least one of these three subjects.

For universities, the book's recommendations are limited to Harvard College (which can be said to be the Faculty of Arts and Sciences of Harvard University) and are not intended for general application. In the four-year, sixteen-course program, the committee believes that six courses should belong to general education, of which three are relatively preliminary and should be taken in the first two years, and three are more advanced and should be taken in the last two years. The three advanced courses can be freely selected, but are limited to courses specifically recognized by the committee as having general educational value, and must not belong to the student's chosen major. The three preliminary courses are specifically designed: one is "Great Works of Literature," one is "Western Thought and Society," and one is "Essentials of Physical Science" or "Essentials of Biological Science."

But the main contribution of this book does not lie in the quantitative allocation of courses, because the difference between general education and specialized education does not lie in its content, but in its methods and purposes. The goal of general education is to cultivate free people and citizens who can think effectively, express their own thoughts, make appropriate judgments, distinguish values, and respect truth and the happiness of the public.

The book is full of insightful observations, such as: "Language training is the common task of all teachers." "Teachers know that their influence on students is not limited to the subjects they teach." "The study of foreign languages, in addition to the commonly recognized instrumental function, also has a liberating effect... Discovering that the meaning of foreign words has something that cannot be directly expressed by native words... may have a value equal to Copernicus's discovery." "General survey courses have their place and are quite important, but the result often stifles students' interest and fails to stimulate their curiosity to continue their research." "Education that is limited to memorizing some half-understood, scattered items, or replaces careful research with effortless explanations, will not succeed." "Too many children are nominally clever and learn too little."

The writing throughout is also very beautiful, unlike the official jargon of most reports. In one place, a long passage from Mencius is quoted (The trees of Ox Mountain were once beautiful), and the erudition of the committee members can also be seen here.

Chinese education has begun to increase dramatically in quantity. How to improve the curriculum to meet the different needs of various students is a major issue at present. But the current university curriculum seems to have become overly specialized, especially in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, whose purpose is different from that of medical and engineering colleges, which are dedicated to training professional talents, and it seems that not enough attention has been paid to general education. This book is available for researchers to consult.

### Basic Knowledge of Literature

— Zheng Jia'ai

Most young people who love literature and art, whether they are majoring in liberal arts or science, like to read some lighter works in their spare time, such as novels, poems, and plays, in addition to the textbooks and reference books assigned in school. Most people do not bother to study those dull literary theories; some people get a headache when they see abstract and numerous terms such as "subjective objectivity," "form," and "essence"... and so on; some people finally make up their minds to finish reading a thick theoretical book; but if you ask them the reason why, they don't know where to start; this kind of trouble is not that young people don't want to read them, nor that there are no books in bookstores, but that there is a lack of excellent, concise, and easy-to-accept literary theory books.

Not long ago, the group's "Basic Knowledge of Literature" gave us a lot of help in this regard; the whole book is divided into twelve chapters, with about 40,000 words; it is quite easy to read, and now I will briefly introduce its central ideas separately as follows:

(1) The essence of literature—literature is a reflection of the reality of life; Gorky said: "The task of literature is to reflect things and describe the life of labor, and to present the truth in images—characters and types." This definition not only explains the essence and characteristics of literature, but also marks its distinction from philosophy and science.

(2) The artistic and social nature of literature—in the literary debates of the past century, the reconciliation and contradiction between "pure literature" and "social literature" has been an unresolved issue, and until now, we have not seen a real sign of the end. However, according to the opinions of the new art theorists, they do not regard the "artistic nature" and "tendency" of literature as opposed, but regard it as a kind of quality that starts from literature itself. The social tendency of literature will not distort reality or harm art, but is consistent with the truth of art.

(3) Literature and reality—literature must be based on reality, start from reality, and at the same time conquer reality, defeat reality, stand above reality, see its future, and give it a general expression.

(4) Material and theme—material is an independent existence of objective reality, which is not related to the writer's subjectivity, while the theme is something that has been subjectively recognized by the writer; once the material is selected by the writer as the theme, his intention is revealed. A creator should expand his horizons, take creative material from all aspects of the changing reality, and enrich his literary thoughts, while fully developing the breadth of the material and the diversity of the theme.

(5) Literary creation method—the same material, after being processed by two writers with different worldviews, will produce completely different meanings. This method of determining the observation and induction of things is called "creation method" in literature. From material to theme, it must pass through the "method" bridge. A creator's worldview is not determined by his family background, but by the society in which he is born.

(6) Romanticism—Gorky said: "The two basic trends or tendencies in literature are realism and romanticism." Romanticism prevailed in Europe from the end of the 18th century to the beginning of the 19th century, with Germany being the most developed. Goethe and Schiller were the pioneers of this doctrine. They advocated the worship of human nature and the ideal of mankind, and emphasized fantasy and personal indulgence; British romanticism was not so simple; it can be divided into two tendencies: one is the negative school—their characteristics are to express pure personal indulgence, the past recollection, and natural yearning; their attitude towards reality is concealment and retreat; the representatives of this school are Wordsworth and Scott. The other school is the active school—their characteristics are to oppose autocracy, monarchy, and tyranny; they have a passion for transforming the world, to pursue freedom and liberation; and to declare war on reality; the representatives of this school are Shelley and Byron. The difference between the two schools, simply put, is that the former pulls back reality, while the latter promotes reality.

(7) Realism—realistic writing originated in the early 19th century and prevailed in the late 19th century; it originated with the rise of the propertied class. It was created in France by Stendhal and Balzac; although Balzac focused on the scenes of real life, he still could not avoid imagination and subjective exaggeration; in fact, the real founder of realism was Flaubert, who imitated things purely with an objective attitude and calmly, completely rejecting the artist's fanaticism; Zola took him as his model. Although the works of this school exposed the darkness of capitalist society, the social status of the writers limited their development; therefore, they only stopped at exposure and criticism, and could not see its future and way out.

(8) New Realism—the creative method of this school of thought is to overcome the pure subjective romanticism and pure objective realism of reality; it is based on the standpoint of the new advanced class, and penetrates the writer's subjectivity and social objectivity; and grasps the truth of reality; their purpose is to arouse the readers' enthusiasm and courage to fight for the ideals that have not yet been realized.

(9) The generality of literature—writers must remove the special and accidental parts from the phenomena, and focus on its universality and necessity, and extract its essence from individual phenomena—this is the process from the actual "facts" to the artistic "truth," and the truth of literature can only be discovered from here.

(10) Language of text (writing)—literature is expressed through language; without language, there is no literature. The language of literature is not the daily spoken language, but the correct language that has been selected, transformed, and refined by the writer; but in some cases, in order to make the characters appear particularly vivid and realistic, the spoken language of the people must be applied, and even local dialects cannot be lacking.

(11) The form of literature—content and form are essential elements of literature that cannot be ignored; in an excellent literary work, these two aspects must be appropriately matched and naturally unified; if you only pay attention to the beauty of the form, that is to "cover up the simplicity and poverty of the spirit." Therefore, an author should strive for simplicity and clarity in form, rather than gorgeousness or skill. Today, the genres of literature can be roughly divided into four categories: 1. Novels (long, short, and medium) 2. Poetry (narrative poems, lyric poems, and epics) 3. Drama (multi-act plays and one-act plays) 4. Reportage literature.

(12) Literary legacy Ding Xin's realistic writings must widely absorb various literary heritages. The so-called acceptance is not imitation and unconditional learning of characteristics; but to use their own subjective critical attitude to screen out the dross from the heritage of world literature, extract the essence, and then, through digestion, make it become the blood that nourishes oneself and opens up one's own development.

"Basic Knowledge of Literature" is only a thin little book, with a total length of less than two hundred pages; but the author has spent a lot of effort on it; he had to refer to many world literary masterpieces and literary theory books; to analyze them, compare them, and then write them down systematically after careful thinking; when he explains a phenomenon, he often cites examples, which not only makes it easy for us to understand, but also can adjust the dull atmosphere; for example, when he compares the styles of "realism" works, he cites a paragraph from Flaubert's "Madame Bovary" and Balzac's "Cousin Bette" each, so that we can read them. In this way, we can deeply understand it and appreciate literary masterpieces.

Each chapter of this book has a brief question at the end, which is very suitable for individual self-study or small group discussion and research. In addition, the bibliography attached to each chapter makes us familiar with many great literary books, which can be regarded as a "harvest" outside of the harvest.

### Criticism and Appreciation

— Zhu Li

Someone once made a suggestion: a critic must also be a writer or have had creative experience. This opinion is correct, but it cannot be turned into a formula.

A writer has his own style and judgment in his writings, and it is naturally unavoidable that there are subjective components; in a work, there is his cultivation and insights. Critics who adhere to their own standards and give the same criticism to any work not only give the author a slander, but also give the reader a formulaic concept, damage the value of the work, and also control the reader's appreciation.

The reason for advocating that a critic is also a writer is to hope that when criticizing a work, he will appreciate the process of the work's creation, from appreciation to criticism, integrated in a situation. In this way, with appreciation as the basis of criticism, feeling love for the work, the criticism will be cautious. Creation is free, an educator may also be a writer, and his works may be completely different in the two aspects. A critic uses his expertise or insights in a certain area to criticize the work. This is the appreciation of an expert. Criticism and revision of advanced theories or research are needed; but for beginners, the scale should be relaxed and care should be given.

A critic does not have to be a writer, but must be an appreciator. He is enthusiastic about reading works in a certain area, can understand the content of the work and also understands the author's hard work. He loves other people's works more than he loves his own. This kind of critic will not use his own subjectivity and formula to measure a work, nor will he force readers to go on his path of ideas.

Criticism and appreciation are different. A critic can be an appreciator, but an appreciator is not necessarily a critic. Most readers are appreciators. They learn about the author from a book or a work, appreciate the work, and get education and instruction from it; they do not need to criticize a work, but they also have their own appreciation standards. The appreciation of a work by an appreciator is, on the one hand, the value of the work's response to him, and on the other hand, his own level of understanding: a satirical work that someone takes as a joke comes from the level of understanding.

A critic must be an appreciator, but does not have to be a writer, because he is familiar with and loves other people's works, sympathizes with the author's creation, and puts forward his opinions in appreciation. This is his criticism; putting forward negative criticisms or positive praises of the work is the critic's task.

### On Culture

— Shen Liren

Edited by Wu Wenzao, Journal of Sociology, Series A, No. 1

Written by Bronislaw Malinowski, translated by Fei Xiaotong et al., published by Commercial Press, Shanghai edition, May 1946

The so-called culture, from a static point of view, is the way of life of human beings; from a dynamic point of view, it refers to the degree of achievement shown by human beings in conquering nature. From the meaning of its connotation, then, in a broad sense, it is the formation and accumulation of all common sense and knowledge; while the narrow cultural view is to explain the progress of academic research.

Academic research can be differentiated from the general into various specialized parts, such as the transformation of physics and chemistry into various different branches of science; it can also be abstracted and synthesized from fragmented theoretical systems to form another common discipline, such as the gradual development of political economy and economics, leading to the description of its commonality by sociology. Now, on the one hand of social science, since the creation of sociology, the common outline of the entire social science has been proposed; but in natural science, there is no comprehensive high-level knowledge structure, but the so-called "cultural science," which explains the entire process of human intellectual development, is budding and growing. Although it is only stagnating in the stage of defining the category and pondering the terminology, it is also enough to see the efforts of the forward-looking scholars in general. Previously, connecting natural science and social science, there was only an extremely incomplete "anthropology," which slightly talked about the evolution of human beings, and now with the higher "cultural science," it can be regarded as the harbinger and prototype of the confluence of the two major sciences of nature and society.

It's just that when "cultural science" is not yet enough to be cultivated into a unique science, it has to be subordinated to sociology, and serve as an introduction to the study of human intellectual development, which is why this book belongs to one of the "Sociological Series." The Sociological Series is a great attempt by Dr. Wu Wenzao. In his plan, there are a total of three major series, the purpose of which is to study the Sinicization of sociology and to provide basic sociological reference books, and "Series A" is dedicated to the pure study of sociological theory and methods.

The author of this book, Malinowski, is an authority of the functionalist school of sociology in contemporary times. His view of mankind does not start from the theory of natural evolution alone, nor does it judge from historical analysis alone, but believes that culture is the overlap of human means of life, and its purpose is only to meet the needs of daily life. He has done comprehensive and precise field observations in several communities, and has published many classic epoch-making works. This book is just a very simple basic paper.

In this book, he economically discusses the important scope of all cultural organizations, and narrates it with enlightening strokes. First, he talks about the differences in culture, due to the inheritance of tradition or the differences in regions, and then establishes various chaotic cultural routes. Then, he explains the general principles of culture, and uses a new classification method to incorporate each aspect of culture into an independent unit. After making a simple definition of cultural science, he puts forward the banner of functionalism, explaining the author's standpoint on the cultural view, and then briefly relating it to the role of culture. The following six chapters are devoted to the study of the social part of culture, regarding the forms, functions, and combinations of social institutions, their basic generative nature, cultural coercion, and ritual activities. The next thing to study is strange words, which is a specific method of discussing the spiritual part of culture. Finally, the origin and progress of spiritual culture are examined fragmentarily and one by one. Between these seemingly inseparable three departments, consistent material conditions are linked, occupying an important position in culture. Finally, "Summary and Conclusion" determine the value of experiential cultural theory, because people not only need to understand the causes of culture, but also should know what culture is, how it happens, and how it changes; then, they can deeply understand the essence of culture, and transform culture to meet the civilization that human beings expect. Of course, all are based on the functionalist theory.

In this long article, what is best explained is the issue of witchcraft, which, along with the physiological basis of witchcraft, transitions to religious beliefs and their functions, which is not easy to obtain detailed explanations and conjectures in other works discussing the same issue.

For the remaining one-third of the book, Dr. Wu Wenzao's "On Cultural Forms" is a supplementary work corresponding to the "On Culture" section. What he explains is all the most primitive outline of cultural theory, almost entirely explaining the value and practice of the three-factor division of culture, and involving the description of the eight original elements of culture. The so-called three-factor division of culture is the further theory obtained by melting together Marx's material monism, Hegel's spiritual monism, and Durkheim's social monism, combining the three of material, society, and spirit into one, and pointing out the relationship and inseparability between them. If this book lacks this part, it will make readers only obtain fragmentary knowledge and cannot understand it thoroughly.

To create a complete and beautiful "cultural science," it is naturally necessary for scholars to work hard, but in this book, you can also see some rough outlines. If you further supplement and organize it, I am afraid it will not be a matter that can only be hoped for forever!

### On Literature and Reality

— Chen Mo

Before discussing the interrelationship between literature and reality, we might as well first provide a brief explanation of their individual meanings:

What is literature? It is difficult to give a specific and precise answer to this question. However, according to general opinion, literature is an art that uses abstract written symbols (or language) as a tool and means of expression. Its special function is to reflect the reality of society and express the author's thoughts and emotions in a figurative way, while also manifesting the author's desire for improving reality.

What is reality? It is the modern, truthful existence. It is not the old history of the past, nor the beautiful dreams of the future, but the current, bloody, and vivid truth. To put it more profoundly, reality is composed of the real vertical aspect of historical development and the real horizontal aspect of social life development.

Literature is a reflection of reality and an expression of the author's thoughts and emotions. Reality, however, is literature's vast source of inspiration and the sacred ground for nurturing the author's thoughts and feelings.

If there is no literature, reality will lose its colors, light, and power of the era and appear weak, mediocre, and desolate!

If there is no reality, there simply will be no literature. At the very least, there will be no literary flowers with any era value or vitality!

Literature draws from reality and improves it. Reality provides for literature, and, due to the improvement of literature, it becomes more enriched. This cycle of mutual exchange and evolution continues, thus allowing the reality of the era to continuously develop forward and literature to continuously radiate brilliance!

However, reality is not equal to literature, and literature is not simply reality.

Because the various phenomena contained in reality are very chaotic and vulgar, while what literature expresses is pure and refined, like pure steel forged from refined iron, or brocade woven from tangled silk.

The phenomena of reality are constantly changing, while what literature expresses is fixed, unchanging, and eternally immortal.

The essence of reality is hidden and obscure, while what literature expresses is clear and exposed.

The impression that reality gives people is chaotic and divergent, while what literature expresses is unified and consistent.

Because the purpose of all literature is to reflect the essence of true reality and the focus of the era, and to guide humanity toward a dreamland of truth, goodness, and beauty; but how can this highest purpose of literature be accomplished? That is, how can the essence of reality and the focus of the era be accurately reflected? For this, the author must first be a true and authentic person, pursue a true and authentic life, seek the truth of life within a true life, seek the truth of human life, and search for the fallacies of life and the truths of the social era in the hearts of the broad masses!

Furthermore, because a complete literary work is produced when the author melts objective reality into subjective thoughts and emotions and then expresses it through artistic form. This, in turn, involves the correctness of the author's subjective thoughts and the skillfulness of expression.

To go even deeper, whether literature is realistic or not cannot be judged solely by its subject matter. The most important thing is whether the theme contained in the subject matter is constructive and positive; whether the soul embodied in the work's inherent quality and realism is vivid and beautiful, great and vigorous!

Therefore, the relationship between literature and reality depends not only on the importance of having realistic subject matter, but the most crucial determining factor lies in whether the inherent soul and theme of the literary work are realistic.

### ### "L'Assommoir" and Its Author

— Li Hui

In his novel "L'Assommoir," Zola writes about the tragic female character Gervaise and two types of Parisian male workers of the time: the perpetually drunken Coupeau and the deeply concerned Goujet.

Gervaise was abandoned by her family at the age of fourteen because she had a child with the hat maker Lantier. When Lantier's meager assets were exhausted, she was kicked out by her husband, who was idle and needed to be drunk and have his fill of food and cigarettes. She then endured hardship and worked as a laundress to support her children and establish a new, happy family. However, the new family member, the tinsmith Coupeau, was also someone who needed to be drunk and have his fill of food and cigarettes. His earnings were insufficient to cover his expenses, and Lantier's shamelessness led him to rejoin the family, immediately consuming everything Gervaise had diligently built. Naturally, Lantier drifted to another woman, Coupeau died in a drunken frenzy, and Gervaise, after sending her son to learn a trade, toiled her entire life, eventually being gradually killed by poverty and loneliness.

When Gervaise left Lantier and got together with Coupeau, she also met the young worker Goujet. Goujet was a passionate Republican. We can learn from history books that this was the time when the First French Republic was being destroyed and the Second Empire was beginning. The ray of light that the Parisian workers had gained at the risk of artillery fire had been submerged, and ambitious workers were spending days of suffering in anxiety and frustration. In addition to the frustration with the current situation, Goujet also had complex issues with the woman he loved. His predicament can be imagined. Gervaise sympathized with him very much and hoped to break away from her husband and children and elope with Goujet, but her heart was willing and her strength was not enough. In the end, everyone was dragged down by life, past their youth, past their prime, until, when Lantier left and Coupeau died, Gervaise was already destitute in the tavern and on the streets at night. All ideals were illusory and unattainable, thus creating a tragedy in which everyone was heartbroken.

In "L'Assommoir," only Lantier succeeded. After consuming Gervaise's wealth, he drifted to Adèle, and when Gervaise recovered, he came to consume Gervaise again. Once he had used everything up again, he drifted to Virginie. He had nothing to worry about as long as he had the ability to toy with women.

But, of course, the final fate of Lantier, Coupeau, Goujet, and Gervaise was the same, just like the lives of most workers in the Parisian working-class districts. After living in ignorance from childhood to that low and cramped world, they had to toil their entire lives, unable to improve their lives, and could only collapse as their energy was depleted, regardless of whether they had good or bad intentions while alive.

We know that Zola was a naturalist writer. His artistic works emphasized factual research and experimentation. To write about a monk, he would live in a monastery; to write about patients, he would first observe the conditions of the ward in a hospital, the prices, the scenery outside the window, and even all external sounds, etc. He hoped that his works could accurately depict the truth of the society in which he lived.

The tragic scenes and unfortunate characters in "L'Assommoir" clearly contain Zola's thoughts and hopes. Zola, like Gervaise, Coupeau, Goujet, and Lantier, lived in Paris during the Second Empire. His personal experiences clearly moved his upright soul. He had great sympathy for the tricked workers, but because of his deep and broad compassion for the sufferers, he more earnestly criticized their lamentable behavior. He borrowed Goujet's voice to point at Paris and say:

"People are always doing useless things there, and the people will one day regret their inaction." Coupeau and Lantier are conscious bystanders suffering in a painful society. Gervaise is an unconscious bystander who wants to endure hardship and raise the gate of society with one hand but is ultimately crushed to death by it. The deaths of Coupeau and Gervaise clearly illustrate that the tragedy of bystanders will continue to be inherited by their descendants due to their bystanderism. This is clearly hinted at by the fact that fifteen-year-old Nana starts to work as a prostitute.

Of course, Zola did not conspicuously propose in "L'Assommoir" that Coupeau and others should immediately take action and how to act. He was a writer who only focused on experimentation. He only wanted to tell the world what the slums of Paris were like, how they worked hard like Gervaise, were slippery like Lantier, were dissolute like Coupeau, and were passionate like Goujet, how tragic their encounters were, and how they did not know how to extinguish the misfortune that was being inherited. He only said: They will regret it.

Zola was humble. He only wanted to provide his materials for people to study. Therefore, the sympathy Gervaise evokes in the readers is particularly strong. Although they are already dead, it seems as if they are still in regret.

### Barefoot Man (Sketch)

— Ye Hong

On a hot day, the asphalt pavement was steaming and soft, almost emitting smoke.

The rows of lush shade trees along the road could not block the invasion of the heat wave, and everything in the space seemed unusually quiet. Only the cicadas hiding in the leaves were stretching their throats and desperately chirping.

Suddenly, a distant sound came:

Rumble, rumble...

Gradually, two shirtless men pulled a rickety cart closer. Dozens of large watermelons were piled on the cart. The green watermelon rinds and the men's upper bodies, scorched red by the sun, formed a very clear contrast.

One of the men, an old man with gray hair, felt his mouth so dry it was about to catch fire. He gritted his teeth, took a few more steps, and stopped, panting. He pulled down the yellowed white towel from his belt and wiped his head and face in a flurry. Then he glanced at the younger man:

"Water bottle, quick!" His voice was a little hoarse, and his nostrils felt strangely painful from the heat.

The young man slowly climbed onto the rickety cart and rummaged under the watermelons, pulled out a flat water bottle, shook it hard next to his ear, and handed it to the old man.

The old man suddenly pulled out the wooden stopper, put the bottle to his mouth, and drank straight down. It was so hard, so hard to catch a breath:

"Hey—" He paused and put the cart's belt around his neck: "Let's go!"

"Uncle, why don't you rest a little longer?" The young man rolled his eyes.

"Rest a little longer?" A bitter smile appeared on the old man's face: "Look at the time, the sun is setting. It's important to catch up with business. If you eat this kind of hard work, you can't complain about being tired... Alas!"

The old man was like a tired old horse, using all his strength to pull the rickety cart, taking one step at a time. The young man pushed behind the cart, the wheels heavily pressing on the soft, hot pavement, leaving two thick marks as the wheels rolled.

Several naked children were gathered around a broken water faucet by the roadside, taking a cool bath. The water gurgled out, and the children jumped up and down happily. When they saw the cart of watermelons being pulled over, several pairs of eyes swept towards the cart at the same time:

"Watermelon, look at the big watermelon!"

The rickety cart rumbled past again.

The rickety cart dragged across several roads, and the old man had to stop to drink water again. Suddenly, two guys in yellow uniforms flashed out from the roadside.

A tall guy in a yellow uniform shouted:

"Where are you going?"

"To... to Xujiahui." The old man quickly put on a smile, his voice shaking pitifully.

"Rules, do you understand?" Another guy put his hands on his hips, his eyes about to pop out.

"This... this..." The old man touched his buttocks, "this" for a long time but couldn't say anything. The tall guy stared at a big watermelon with wide eyes, and with lightning speed, he picked it up and was about to leave...

The old man kept bowing and making gestures:

"Sir, have pity on us! Losing one will make us lose money! Thank you!" The tall guy raised his head:

"Stop talking nonsense!" He took a big step and left.

The old man grabbed the yellow uniform with one hand, almost kneeling down.

"Sir, have pity on people like us, we really can't afford to lose it..."

"Damn it, you barefoot people really don't know what's good for you, let go, don't pull my clothes!"

"Please..."

Suddenly, with a loud smack, a giant palm slapped the old man's face. The old man felt a darkness in his eyes, and stars danced before him. He couldn't hold on any longer and fell to the ground.

The young man quickly helped him up. He rubbed his burning left cheek and looked intently, but the yellow uniform was long gone.

The old man muttered angrily:

"Barefoot people! Barefoot people!... Suddenly he shouted: "Barefoot people are not people!"

He stood there blankly for a long time, sighed deeply:

"Let's go! It's almost there, consider ourselves unlucky today!"

The fireball in the sky had unconsciously rolled down the horizon, and the shadows of the two barefoot men gradually disappeared in the twilight...

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 37

— Ye Jingfeng

In such times of fortune, he married a Miss Zisun and in the following years, gave him five family members; first a flower, then a fruit, then another flower, then another fruit. Finally, there was another little lilac. This was called alternating peanuts, a girl and a boy, etc. Before the sixth young gentleman Weizhu arrived, he suddenly changed his policy and became a follower of Mrs. Shan'e, implementing a birth control movement. So, Little Lilac was seven or eight years old, but the sixth young gentleman had not yet been born.

No matter how you look at it, this engineer is an out-and-out "family first" advocate. In other words, he is a model husband to his wife and a model parent to his children. He would rather eat and wear less himself, but always let his children eat their fill and dress warmly. Education? Of course, he would send every child to school and give them a proper education according to their age. He often said, "Even if we are so poor that we go hungry, we cannot let our children drop out of school."

Perhaps it was to make ends meet and provide for the children's food, clothing, and education, so before the age of forty, his hair had already turned gray, and his waist was a little crooked. But he generally did not appear old. Look at him still wearing a snow-white fine silk long-sleeved shirt, the cuffs rolled up on my forearms, white canvas shorts, thick white wool long socks, green silk sock garters, plus half an inch of longitudinals, dragging outside the rolled cuffs. Although his leather shoes were old, with overlapping wrinkles and several places with a tendency to crack, they were still polished brightly. This outfit portrayed the energy of an English gentleman.

Although he was full of sorrow, he wanted me to give him an idea; but the theme of his article was hidden in the second half of the article. What should I base it on to give him an idea? I knew he had already picked up half of the "Wei mouth" and half of the "Jing oil" tune. When he spoke, he had to go around several big circles, hinting from the side. Unless you can really let go of the topic, grab the end of the sentence, and wake up the topic for him, he would have to go around a few more circles.

"Old Wu, spare me, give me a topic," I pleaded, "If you don't give me a topic, what idea should I give?"

"Hey," he sighed greatly, meaning "you confused egg." He stared, "How should I say it? ... You are 'mud bodhisattva points gold! Pretending to be confused.' Look at you, last night, the big cannons were noisy, more lively than the New Year, don't you care a little bit?"

Understood. But it only counts as understanding half of it, that is to say, probably his theme is related to the war. Recalling what he just said, "You are a bachelor, ... my whole family" etc., maybe he wanted to discuss a safety issue in wartime?

"Brother Wu, are you saying that this Weixin shop is not very safe?"

"Yes!" He patted heavily on his thigh with his hand, "But you only said half of it, ... like my family, two old ones, five small ones, if we don't think of a way early, ... it's hard to say that we can just muddle through like this? ... We also have to muddle through, don't we?" His voice was a little off. If he continued to speak, he might be sad and shed tears.

This cannot be blamed on him. Leaving aside other things, let's talk about his children: Miss Meijun - his naming of the children includes an engineering design; for girls, Meijun, Lanjun, Zhujun, probably prepared that soon there will be a fourth Qianjin "Jujun", making a set. The sons are Shiren, Shiyi; this has already been cashed; in the reservation transaction, there are probably also Shili, Zhizhi; maybe there is also Shixin. This kind of name arrangement has some flexibility and is a smart way. In case there are only two sons, of course, only Ren and Yi can stand. If there are four, "Renyi Lizhi" is also a set. Suppose there is a spare one, isn't "Renyi Lizhixin" also a set? In any case, I think he is very confident, there is no problem with the wife, and there is no problem with himself as long as the environment is good.

Meijun is now seventeen years old, not to mention how beautiful she is, just say that she is a school flower in school, and when she returns to Changxindian, she is simply a rare flower, no, she is simply a Ganoderma in a deep mountain and valley. Isn't there also several thousand people in the Weixin shop area? Let's talk about women, pretty or ugly, also not a small number, but there is no one like Meijun.

### Fallen Leaves

— Shao Fu

The leaves of the parasol tree in front of the window fell three or two pieces in a gust of wind, and the season changed. Cool autumn in September, the grass withered outside the Great Wall, although the trees are still green and the flowers are red in Jiangnan, the cold is coming, and the desolate image is gradually revealed.

In the small circle of Shanghai, life is the same, cars are galloping, women are passing, wine and dancing are joyful, and US dollars are flying around. The only difference is the color of the clothes, from light to dark, and the material from thin to thick. Chewing ice cream in the air conditioner is the same as in the heater.

Climate has become an embellishment of life, even a boast of life. Of course, there are also people who feel oppressed and threatened, and these people are not few in number.

Who wants to see Changbai Mountain and Songhua River? Even northern Jiangsu dares not face it! In these few days of the Senate, haven't we been provided with many problems around us?

It is better to prevent than to remedy. As the weather gets cold, for the sake of this winter, everyone should consider several serious situations that are about to come as soon as possible; it is better to rely on the people than on the government (the government still relies on the people, and the strength of the government is really difficult to be thorough). Everything we bravely undertake ourselves and plan out a proper solution.

If we sit by the stove drinking coffee and let some friends in single shirts wander in the cold wind, although it is an artistic contrast or foil, it is too cruel.

### News Data: Jiamusi, the Capital of Hegang Province, Will Become the Headquarters of the Northeast Communist Army

— Zheng Fan

Speaking of Jiamusi, many people must feel a little unfamiliar with this place name. Indeed, this city located in the Songhua River has not received its news for fifteen years. During the period of occupation, it could not be found in the geography class in the upper Taiguo, so it is no wonder that everyone has not been very familiar with it.

But this city will become the target of everyone's attention. Because: In the war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in the Northeast, the situation of the Communist Party has reversed sharply, and the Communist army stationed in Harbin has transported a large amount of military equipment to Jiamusi. According to the recent trend, Jiamusi will become the new headquarters of the Communist army in the Northeast.

Now, let me give a brief introduction to Jiamusi:

Jiamusi is the capital of Hegang Province, located on the south bank of the Songhua River in the center of the province, 200 miles northeast of Harbin. Huachuan County was established here during the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty. Later, due to floods, it was moved to Yuelai Town. (That is, the current Huachuan county seat.)

Jiacheng has extremely convenient transportation. Shipping on the Songhua River can carry ships of about 1,000 tons, sailing upstream to Harbin and downstream to the confluence of the Heilongjiang River. Land transportation includes the Tujia and Suijia railways, which are connected here from Tumen, 580 kilometers away, and Suihua, 282 kilometers away. At the same time, it is the central station of the highway from Harbin to Fuyuan. During the puppet Manchukuo era, air traffic in this area had three lines to Fujin, Harbin, and Yilan.

The enemy's deliberate operation has made the factories in Jiacheng flourish and the markets have increased greatly, and it has also become one of the major cities in the Northeast. The factors that have created the prosperity of Jiacheng, in addition to the superior transportation conditions mentioned above, are the abundance of agricultural products in the vicinity. The Songhua River basin near the city has fertile land for thousands of miles, producing beans and wheat. In the past, when the Japanese coveted the Northeast, they used armed forces to cultivate this area, which can also show the abundance of products here.

Jiacheng originally had a puppet Manchukuo "National Jiamusi Medical University" with two grades and 157 students. After the victory, when we went to take over, we did not expect that the school, called the "National University" of "Manchukuo", was full of Japanese students. There was no reason to let it continue to operate, so we closed it down. During the puppet Manchukuo era, Jiacheng's secondary schools also included Jiamusi Shidao School, Provincial Jiamusi National High School, Jiamusi Higher Girls' School, etc., a total of seven schools. The education implemented was of course completely "friendly country style".

The weather there is very cold, all belonging to the continental climate, with extremely short summers. The hottest time is no more than 80 degrees Fahrenheit, but in the coldest winter, the temperature often reaches minus 20 to 30 degrees. Every July, there is already a cool rain, the grass and trees wither in mid-August, and heavy snow will fall in September, and the cup flowers in the river will also freeze, and people and horses can travel freely on it. The weather in the Northeast is already cold now, and I can imagine that on the banks of the Songhua River, some people are still fighting for territory, with smoke and fire everywhere, which really arouses endless feelings!

### Good Words

— Suo

One should not be complacent, but one should be content; complacency is in terms of knowledge and ability, thinking that one is already remarkable; contentment is in terms of material life, one should know to have restrictions and think one step back in everything. If so, your intelligence will gradually increase, and your material desires will be controlled; then, knowledge and happiness will run into your blood.

### Time is Money

— Ling Yun

Although the shrewdness of us Chinese people may not match that of the Jews, our bargaining skills are definitely second to none. Whether in the vegetable market, the secondhand stall, the fruit stall, or the used bookstore, we can easily witness such dramas – haggling over a very small amount for a considerable amount of time. Their eyes are fixed on that number, calculating every cent, but ignoring precious time. I have also seen some self-made old gentlemen who are very frugal, preferring to save a few hundred yuan in transportation costs and endure half an hour in the scorching sun. This spirit is indeed admirable, but in reality, it is somewhat of a losing proposition. If they could use the energy spent walking on their business, they would naturally reap more than just a few hundred yuan.

This reminds me of a story I once heard about time:

Benjamin Franklin set up a small bookstore in Philadelphia. One day, a stingy customer came to his bookstore. He wanted to buy a book but thought the clerk's price was too high, so he asked to see the owner.

The clerk refused, saying, "Mr. Franklin is very busy and doesn't have time to see you."

But the bored customer aimlessly rummaged through the bookshelves for more than an hour and insisted on seeing the owner. The clerk, unable to dissuade him, had to report to Franklin.

Mr. Franklin hurriedly put aside his writing and editing work and came out to see the customer.

"Mr. Franklin, what is the lowest price for this book?"

Franklin replied simply, "One and a quarter dollars."

"One and a quarter dollars? Your clerk only asked me for one dollar."

"Yes," Franklin replied, "then why are you preventing me from working peacefully?"

The idle customer, unsure whether Franklin was joking or serious, asked again, "Please tell me, how much does this book really cost?"

"Now, one and a half dollars."

"What? One and a half dollars – didn't you just say one and a quarter dollars?"

"Yes, I think you'd better take it for one and a half dollars now!"

The stingy customer immediately paid the price and fled.

Although this is just a story, it gives us a very powerful suggestion: many people ignore the preciousness of time and waste other people's valuable time!

In the office, we can hear a lot of trivial talk; in school, we can see a lot of misleading entertainment; and in society, there are countless time-wasting social engagements.

They are all thieves of Father Time.

Shanghai Dynamics

### Too Few Animals in the City - We Need a Zoo

— Paul

Shanghai's first municipal zoo was established on August 1, 1933, on Wenmiao Road in the Nanshi district, with a land area of 7.3 mu. In the autumn of 1934, at the peak of the zoo’s operations, there were 28 animal enclosures of various sizes. The zoo housed 32 species of mammals, including tigers, leopards, lions, elephants, black bears, camels, kangaroos, and sika deer. There were also 44 species of birds, including peacocks, white cranes, pelicans, mandarin ducks, herons, geese, pheasants, and eagles. The zoo also had 4 species of reptiles, including lizards, pythons, turtles, and soft-shelled turtles. In February 1935, the zoo even purchased a whale measuring over forty feet in length from fishermen in Chongming. Its head was about ten feet wide, its teeth as sharp as saws, and its flesh had been removed, leaving only its skin and bones, weighing over five thousand catties. In 1933 (from August 1, 1933 to June 30, 1934), the zoo's ticket revenue reached 20,468.44 yuan, and the number of visitors was 1,159,306. In 1934, the zoo expanded its area to 10.9 mu, and the annual ticket revenue was 17,818.16 yuan, with 1,059,781 visitors. After that, the annual number of visitors often exceeded one million. The zoo was under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau. Preparations began in October 1931 and took two years to complete. During the "August 13th" Incident, the zoo moved some of the tigers and leopards to Gujiazhai Park for safekeeping, but the rest were destroyed. To this day, there is still no news of its restoration.

Tiger Suffers from TB

The public has a strong interest in zoos. In October 1935, when a tiger in the zoo died of tuberculosis, and on April 22, 1936, when a giant elephant in the zoo was electrocuted and died, the news spread, newspapers reported it, and the whole society was in an uproar, becoming a topic of discussion on every street and alley.

In addition to the aforementioned municipal zoo, there was also a zoo attached to the Zhaofeng Park under the jurisdiction of the Public Concession's Bureau of Works at that time. The Bureau of Works began constructing Zhaofeng Park in 1914. At that time, the park superintendent, Mr. Creagh, specified in his plan to set up an animal section in the park. In reality, it was not until 1918 that the park began exhibiting birds and animals such as mandarin ducks, pigeons, owls, rabbits, goats, kites, and monkeys. In 1921, the Bureau of Works spent money to purchase an additional 2.939 mu of vacant land adjacent to the north of the park site to develop a zoo. The work was completed and opened in 1922, and it still exists today.

Educational Significance

Zoos are very beneficial to children's education. Most municipal authorities in countries around the world run zoos for the public to visit. Countries such as England, the United States, Japan, and France all have more than thirty or forty zoos. Taking the Ueno Park Zoo in Tokyo and the London Zoo as examples, an average of more than three million people visit them each year. The enthusiastic situation can be imagined.

Shanghai is China's premier city with a population of over 3.4 million. Currently, there is only one zoo, inherited from foreigners, and it is desolate, dilapidated, with a small area and limited "animals." Every holiday and festival, it is crowded and noisy, becoming a situation where people are watching people, and sightseeing is out of the question. Today, as municipal administration is gradually getting on track, we want to shout to the officials in charge:

We Need a Standard Zoo

### A Speech That Shocked the World - US Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace

— Ganlai

The Chinese should not feel unfamiliar with the name Henry Wallace, because he once visited Chongqing, Kunming, and other places as a personal representative of the late President Roosevelt, and met and consulted with important figures from our country's party and government.

There is no room for hesitation; Wallace, in his capacity as Secretary of Commerce, delivered a speech on US foreign policy in New York City on the 12th of this month, advocating for friendly relations between the US and the Soviet Union, free from the constraints of British foreign policy. This speech shocked the world. The consequences of Wallace's views and speech are beyond the scope of this article. Here, we will briefly introduce Wallace's background and experience:

Henry Wallace was born on October 7, 1888, in Adair County, Iowa, USA. By the age of 21, he had already graduated from Iowa State University.

Enthusiastic about Agriculture

Iowa had an agricultural publication - "Wallace's Farmer" - founded single-handedly by Wallace's grandfather. After leaving school in 1910, he joined the publication as a staff member. At that time, the editor of the publication was his father.

In 1921, Wallace's father was summoned by President Harding to Washington to serve as Secretary of Agriculture. The editing duties of the publication were handed over to Wallace. At this time, he was thirty-three years old, at the peak of his youth and promise. He personally guided and completed many agricultural experiments, with satisfactory results, especially in the improved cultivation of a certain type of corn, which resulted in significant increases in yields.

Wallace's grandfather and father were both Republicans. Wallace initially joined as a Republican as well. Later, because of his sympathy for the policies of the late President Roosevelt, he declared his support for Roosevelt and switched to the Democratic Party in 1932.

Secretary of Agriculture

In 1933, the late President Roosevelt admired his talent and specially appointed Wallace as Secretary of Agriculture. His main political achievement during his tenure was the drafting of the "Agricultural Adjustment Act," but this act was ruled unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court in 1935. Wallace revised it and eventually passed it.

In June 1940, he was nominated as the Democratic candidate for Vice President. In November of the same year, he and Roosevelt were elected as President and Vice President.

In 1944, he participated in the election again but lost. In the spring of the same year, he was ordered to serve as Secretary of Commerce, until today. He is a very interesting character.
