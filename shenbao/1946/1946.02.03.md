### Naval Education During Construction

— Shen Shengyi

The reason why China's maritime industry is underdeveloped is said to be due to a lack of talent. However, this kind of talent lacks purpose, leading to learning not being applied, which also hinders the development of the industry, with far-reaching and profound impacts. According to historical records, the people along China's coast were already sailing hundreds of miles offshore in ancient times. The "Long Hair" chapter of the "Shang Song" in the Book of Songs states, "Xiang Shi was illustrious, reaching beyond the seas." It is said that Xiang Shi was a distant ancestor of Shang Tang, and "overseas" refers to the Liaodong Peninsula today. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (140 BC), large merchant ships set sail from Xuwen and Hepu on the Leizhou Peninsula to reach Huangzhi State in West India. During the Five Dynasties period, the Arab Masudi wrote the book "The Meadows of Gold," describing Chinese ships sailing directly to the Persian Gulf for trade, which shows the distance of voyages at that time. From the third year of the Yongle reign of Emperor Chengzu of Ming to the sixth year of the Xuande reign of Emperor Xuanzong, during twenty-six years, Zheng He sailed to the West seven times, leading 27,800 people, piloting 63 large ships, setting sail from Wuhu Gate in Changle, Fujian Province, passing through more than thirty countries. His maritime life began eighty-one years earlier than the famous world navigator Diaz, who discovered the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa (1487 AD, which is the twenty-third year of the Chenghua reign of Emperor Xianzong of Ming); eighty-six years earlier than Columbus, who discovered the New World of America (1492 AD, which is the fifth year of the Hongzhi reign of Emperor Xiaozong of Ming); and one hundred and fourteen years earlier than Magellan, who discovered the Strait of Magellan, a necessary passage around the world (1520 AD, which is the fifteenth year of the Zhengde reign of Emperor Wuzong of Ming). Zheng He's great achievements and extraordinary talents shook the world long ago, and the eagerness of the Chinese people to live a life at sea is even more evident. Even before the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, the Chinese navy ranked fourth in the world. Later, naval talents emerged in large numbers, but due to the poor politics of the corrupt Qing Dynasty, coupled with the constant blind worship of foreigners, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company refused to employ Chinese crew members, resulting in a lack of development. During the recent World War, more than 20,000 Chinese sailors served on Allied ships, demonstrating loyalty, bravery, and courage, no less than foreigners. As for the excellent maritime technology of Chinese people, according to pre-war statistics of ship accidents from the Customs, the ratio of accidents between Chinese and foreign shipowners was one to five point six. The sinking of the *Xinhua* and *Xinchang* vessels were all caused by foreign

In summary, the government's past policies towards have led to the strange phenomenon of learning not being applied and application not being based on learning. In the future, if China wants to build the country through industry, the first thing we need to consider is whether transportation is developed. If transportation is developed, we must start with waterway transportation. Especially after the war, the destruction of railways is quite severe, not as easy as the construction and repair of waterway transportation facilities, and the maintenance cost is lower in peacetime. Moreover, technical personnel serving on merchant ships can be used for domestic waterway transportation in peacetime and can penetrate any corner of the world. If war breaks out, the government can immediately requisition them for service and convert them into transport fleets and auxiliary warships. Merchant ships are no less than the vanguard of the navy, and also the navy's reserve force. A country with an underdeveloped maritime industry is not qualified to talk about the construction and consolidation of the navy. Therefore, the maritime industry not only has national economic value, but also has significant military significance. However, what was the situation of maritime education facilities in China in the past? It is very painful to talk about it.

(A) Military Schools

(1) Mawei Naval Academy: Founded in the sixth year of the Tongzhi reign, established by Shen Baozhen, the Minister of Naval Affairs and General Manager of the Fuzhou Shipyard, named the Ship Administration Academy, divided into two parts: the former academy studied French and taught various skills in building ships and manufacturing machinery, and the latter academy studied English and taught various methods of navigation and marine engineering. In the second year of the Republic of China, the former was renamed Fuzhou Naval Manufacturing School, and the latter was renamed Fuzhou Naval School, directly under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Navy. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, the Naval Aviation and Submersible School was established, teaching the art of manufacturing airplanes and submarines. After the war, in September of the twenty-seventh year, it moved from Mawei to Xiangtan, Hunan, and then moved to Tongzi, Guizhou, to continue teaching. Over the years, more than 800 students have graduated.

(2) Jiangnan Naval Academy: Established in August of the sixteenth year of the Guangxu reign of the previous Qing Dynasty, located at Yifeng Gate in Nanjing. In the first year of the Republic of China, it was renamed Naval Officer School, and in the sixth year it was renamed Torpedo and Gunnery School, which was soon discontinued. More than 200 students graduated.

(3) Yantai Naval Academy: Established in the twenty-ninth year of the Guangxu reign of the previous Qing Dynasty. In the early years of the Republic of China, the Wusong Naval Academy was merged into this school. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, it moved to Fujian and merged with the Fujian Provincial Naval School.

(4) Tianjin Naval Academy: Established in the sixth year of the Guangxu reign, closed in the twenty-fifth year. Approximately 200 students graduated.

(5) Huangpu Naval Academy: Established in the thirteenth year of the Guangxu reign. In the early years of the Republic of China, it was under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Navy of the Beijing government and renamed Guangdong Naval Academy. It was discontinued after the War of Resistance. More than 100 students graduated.

(6) Wusong Naval Academy: Discontinued in the fourth year of the Republic of China and merged into the Yantai Naval Academy.

(7) Beijing Kunming Lake Naval Academy: Established in the nineteenth year of the Guangxu reign and soon closed. More than 30 students graduated.

(8) Liugong Island Naval Academy: Established in the sixteenth year of the Guangxu reign and soon closed. Only more than 30 students graduated.

(9) Weihaiwei and Hubei Naval Navigation Classes: The period of establishment was very short, and the number of students was not large.

(10) Ministry of Military Administration's Electrical Torpedo School: Established in the Republic of China, located in Jiangyin, Jiangsu, it was essentially also a military school. More than 300 students graduated.

The above schools were all for training naval officers. By the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China, a total of more than 2,000 students had graduated from these schools, including ten in military chemistry, more than 170 in shipbuilding, and more than 30 in torpedoes. Regarding naval soldier training, the Mawei Naval Academy and the Electrical Torpedo School both had training camps.

(B) Merchant Marine Schools

(1) Ministry of Communications' Wusong Merchant Marine College: This school is the highest institution for cultivating ocean-going navigation and marine engineering talents. It was established by Mr. Hong Hong's suggestion to Sheng Xuanhuai, the Minister of Posts and Communications, to independently establish the Ship Administration School of Nanyang University (the predecessor of today's Jiaotong University) at Baotaiwan, Wusong, in the third year of the Xuantong reign of the previous Qing Dynasty, named Merchant Marine School. In the first year of the Republic of China, it was renamed College, with only one navigation course. It was discontinued in the fourth year of the Republic of China. More than 30 students graduated. In the eighteenth year, it was restored by the Ministry of Communications. A marine engineering course was added, recruiting high school graduates for four years of study. The school's affairs were flourishing, and it was expected to expand greatly. Unfortunately, the January 28 Incident struck the school first and suffered heavy losses. After the war, it gradually returned to its original state and established a senior high school, recruiting junior high school graduates, so that they could develop maritime life habits from an early age. As the school was developing, the August 13 Incident broke out, and the school was destroyed again, with only a few books and instruments salvaged. In total, the school has graduated more than 300 people, who were assigned to aviation schools or Allied ships. In the twenty-eighth year, the Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Navy, and the Ministry of Communications to restore the Merchant Marine School in Chongqing, renamed it as a national school, and added a shipbuilding course. In the thirty-second year, a student movement occurred, and the ministry ordered it to be discontinued and merged into Jiaotong University; shipbuilding became a separate department in the School of Engineering, and two departments of navigation and marine engineering management were established. Statistics showed that there were twelve classes in the Chongqing school, with more than 280 students. Among them, students selected by the Military Commission to study naval architecture at MIT in the United States, and those selected by the Ministry of Communications to practice on ships in the United States, totaled about 30 people. More than ten people were sent by the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company or requested to study at Taikoo and Blue Funnel Line in England. More than twenty people worked in domestic maritime administration agencies or shipping companies. The rest all joined the navy and were trained in Miami, USA. Recently, the Fujian Provincial Government and the Ministry of Education plan to establish a maritime vocational school in Fuzhou and Hankou, recruiting junior high school graduates.

(2) There are also two other merchant marine schools, Harbin and Guangdong. The former was taken over by the Puppet Manchukuo after the September 18th Incident and renamed the Seamen Training Center, which was greatly expanded. After the victory, the Ministry of Education ordered it to be merged into the Harbin Institute of Technology. It is said that nearly 100 students have graduated. The latter was discontinued after the war.

(3) Similar to merchant marine schools, there is also the China Merchants Public School, which was run by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company itself. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, it was merged into the Wusong Merchant Marine School.

(C) Fisheries Schools

The fishing and netting department of fisheries schools also focuses on coastal navigation studies, recruiting junior high school graduates, mainly to cultivate fishing boat owners. These include the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial fisheries schools, the Fujian private Jimei Fisheries and Navigation School, and the Tianjin municipal fisheries school. After the war, except for Jimei, which moved to another location to continue classes, the others were all discontinued. Currently, the National No. 2 Middle School in Hechuan, Sichuan, has a fisheries department.

(D) Customs Schools

The Ministry of Finance's Customs College was founded in the first year of the Xuantong reign of the previous Qing Dynasty. In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, a maritime affairs class was established in Shanghai, recruiting high school graduates for three years, purely for cultivating customs anti-smuggling patrol ship drivers. Located on Yaozhu Road in Shanghai, it is now opening classes in Shandong, Chongqing, and has already recruited ocean-going navigation students.

(E) Other Training Courses

Before the war, the Military Commission had maritime administration training courses, but they were mostly for administrative personnel. After the war, the Ministry of Communications' transportation technology personnel training center briefly trained Minsheng Company crew members. Regarding pilots, due to their direct military nature, the Naval Department established a pilot training institute.

In summary, China's maritime education has a history of forty or fifty years, but it has not achieved much to date. The lack of maritime talent remains the same. Political turmoil is a major reason, but maritime education itself also has shortcomings. I will now discuss these shortcomings based on my limited observations.

(1) Military Aspects: In all European and American countries, technical personnel serving on ships are generally reserve naval personnel and obtain formal military status, but this is not the case in China. The navy and merchant ships seem to have no connection at all. Crew members can serve once they obtain a seafarer's license from the Ministry of Communications. The military training received in schools such as the Merchant Marine College and the Customs College is neither fish nor fowl, and is not practical. They lack research on naval tactics and the use of firearms. In the event of an emergency, they cannot respond. In the future, if China is to be listed as one of the great powers, the most basic condition is that the navy's self-defense force must be promoted by everyone, and the method should start with the revitalization of the maritime industry.

(2) Administrative Aspects: Since China began to establish maritime education, there has been no consistent policy. In terms of administration, each unit acts on its own and has no direct relationship with the competent educational authority. It was not until the twenty-sixth year, when the Executive Yuan decided to place the Merchant Marine College and the Customs College under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, that things began to get on the right track, but unfortunately, the war broke out before the transfer could be completed. The Merchant Marine College was restored by the Ministry of Education in Chongqing, while the Customs College was run by the Ministry of Finance. In the future, maritime education institutions should be under unified jurisdiction and a training outline should be determined. The Ministry of Education should hire more maritime experts to preside over the affairs and maintain close contact with naval agencies. In Japan, a small island nation, there are as many as thirty-six senior and junior merchant marine schools and crew training centers. If the current authorities recognize that the maritime industry is a major event in national construction, they should immediately reform it. The two departments of navigation and marine engineering currently attached to Jiaotong University have simple equipment and are difficult to recruit students. Preparations should be made immediately to restore them as an independent college, so that authority can be centralized and work can begin immediately. As for the location of the school, it can be established according to regional needs, with the main campus in Wusong, Datun, and Huangpu, and branch campuses in various ports, such as Harbin, Tianjin, Qingdao, Fuzhou, Hankou, and Chongqing. The nature of the main campus should be established by the state, and all equipment should be as complete as possible. The branch campuses can be established by private individuals or provincial and municipal governments in accordance with regulations.

(3) Training Aspects: For practical students, the focus is on practice. A navigation school, as the name implies, must have its own training ship. This type of training ship should be a three- or four-thousand-ton sailing ship with an iron hull and a propulsion engine. Students should study in segments at the school and on the ship. For example, half a year of lectures at school, half a year on the ship, and then back to school for lectures. This way, learning and application can be combined, which is not only time-efficient but also improves skills rapidly. After graduation, they can travel the world with the training ship to increase their experience. The branch campuses are equivalent to vocational schools, providing initial maritime training. After graduation, they can only enter the main campus again after strict academic, physical, and psychological tests. Another problem is the training of junior seamen (including helmsmen, sailors, machinists, etc.). Although these seamen have less academic knowledge, they have very rich maritime experience. The Merchant Marine College should establish various training courses to train them in stages, so that academic knowledge and technology can be integrated to respond to emergencies. As for the living aspects, they should cultivate their hobbies and interests so that they do not feel lonely when they lead a life at sea. The government seems to have not paid attention to this type of work in the past. Recently, major overseas ports have seamen's clubs, which is a good practice. In the future, the same can be established in domestic coastal ports and expanded into a service and education institution.

(4) Department Aspects: Before the war, the Merchant Marine College established navigation and marine engineering departments. Shipbuilding was only affiliated with a group in the School of Engineering of Tongji University. The talent cultivated by such scarce departments is not enough to cope with inland river transportation, let alone near-sea and even ocean-going transportation. The talents needed for a huge maritime undertaking include: business management personnel of shipping companies; design, manufacturing, testing, and calibration personnel of ship instruments; naval architects and surveyors; port and navigation mark management facility personnel for port affairs; pilots for various inland ports; marine loss adjusters after maritime accidents, international trade personnel, etc. Except for business and international trade, which can be cultivated in the business schools of various universities, all others should be cultivated by the Merchant Marine School with dedicated departments as much as possible to meet the needs.

Recovery is not restoration. We must run the business with the spirit of "death yesterday, life today." We must prepare ahead of time, prepare quickly, establish a long-term plan for the country, and build a huge merchant fleet. I hope that the whole country and people in the maritime industry will work together to promote it!

Inventory Still Takes Time (Our Reporter) According to sources, since the Jianghai Customs was ordered to assist the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau in inventorying enemy and puppet warehouses, it has completed the inventory and prepared inventories for more than 400 warehouses. The total value of the warehoused goods inventoried exceeds 8,800,000,000 yuan. Once the inventory of these warehouses is completed, the Jianghai Customs will affix additional seals. It is reported that during the inventory of the above-mentioned warehouses, the material inventory lists transferred by the original sealing agency were often incomplete, forcing the customs to re-inventory and prepare lists one by one, making the work tedious and time-consuming. Currently, the Jianghai Customs has more than 500 personnel participating in the inventory and management, but there are more than 2,000 enemy and puppet warehouses waiting to be inventoried. It is expected that it will take considerable time to complete the entire inventory. It is reported that the warehouses that have been inventoried mainly contain grain and cloth, which are prone to spoilage. These goods have been stored in warehouses for many years, and there is a risk of damage, and a large amount of warehouse rental fees must be paid every month. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities can expedite the processing and distribution.

### Manufacturers Purchasing China Textile Yarn. Manufacturers Should Register and Obtain Certification from Association

[Our Reporter] China Textile Construction Corporation has issued several batches of cotton cloth, but in the past, sales have not been widespread among manufacturers. In order to improve the situation, the company has formulated measures for manufacturers to register and apply for certification, and has created registration cards for manufacturers to fill out and submit to the association for certification. The dyeing and weaving association has reportedly obtained blank registration cards from the company. If members need to register, they can obtain registration cards from the association, fill them out, and submit them for certification, which will then be sent to the Textile Construction Company.

### Current State of the American Film Industry

— Qian Zheng Sheng

The American film industry is concentrated in Hollywood, located west of Los Angeles in Southern California. The city's favorable climate, with year-round sunlight suitable for filming, and its diverse terrain, including mountains, water, deserts, and various landscapes, provide convenience for shooting outdoor scenes, making it the natural center of the film industry. There are over sixty film production companies, with forty producing drama films, four producing "cartoon" films, six producing educational films, and ten producing industrial and commercial films. In addition, there are over fifty manufacturers of film supplies and equipment, as well as film processing plants.

Among the drama film production companies, the ten most important are known as the "Big Five" in terms of film rental revenue. These are Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (Metro Goldwyn Mayer), 20th Century-Fox, Paramount, Warner Brothers, and R.K.O. These five companies account for over two-thirds of the total film industry revenue. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer accounts for 18%, 20th Century-Fox, Paramount, and Warner Brothers each account for 14%, and R.K.O. accounts for 9%. Other companies such as Columbia and Universal each account for 7%, while Republic, Monogram, and other small companies account for a total of 10%.

The film industry has unique characteristics, with costs that are difficult for the general public to understand. Companies are also reluctant to disclose detailed information about their financial situation. According to a 1939 survey, the total cost of film production (excluding reprints) was $1,860,000,000. There are no figures available after 1939, but it is generally estimated that this cost had increased to between $2,500,000,000 and $3,000,000,000 by 1944. The American film industry produces an average of 250 drama films per year, with an average cost of $1 million per film. The largest productions cost up to $5 million, while the smallest cost over $100,000. Of this cost, approximately three-quarters is attributed to employee salaries and wages, particularly for senior executives, directors, leading actors, and screenwriters, who earn particularly high incomes.

Due to the high costs, the profit margins of the film industry are not as high as generally imagined, ranking tenth among various industries in the United States. According to 1939 statistics, total box office revenue in the United States was $650,000,000. This has continued to increase in recent years, with estimates for 1944 exceeding $1,000,000,000. Of this domestic market box office revenue, 65% is earned by theaters, and 35% is rental revenue earned by production companies. This rental revenue is sufficient to balance production costs (25% of box office revenue) and marketing costs (10%). Therefore, the film industry cannot rely solely on the domestic market; its profit source lies in the foreign market. It is generally estimated that the rental revenue from the foreign market accounts for 11% of domestic box office revenue. The United Kingdom and China account for the largest share. The efforts of the American film industry to compete for overseas markets are therefore quite evident.

### To the Sky! Remarks by the Director and Writer of "A Thousand Miles of Sky"

— Sun Yu

The four characters "A Thousand Miles of Sky" should be written in brilliant gold, they should be written in glorious lightning, because this film records our great and glorious Chinese Air Force.

"Defeating the many with the few," "Facing hundreds as one," is the supreme fearless courage of our heroic Air Force. These young "cheaters of the sky," these vanguards of our sacred national liberation war, their glorious achievements are so worthy of our praise and eternal remembrance!

Rather than calling "A Thousand Miles of Sky" a drama, it is more like a documentary. There are no surprising or intricate plots to stir up emotional waves, nor is there sufficient technical equipment to capture the immensity of aerial combat. I simply described, in a very plain and simple manner—perhaps with a rhythm that is too slow—the process of a few airmen enlisting, learning, relaxing, and participating in combat. There are no fixed protagonists, and naturally no anticipated climax. Eight or nine actors evenly divide the roles; the entire film's surface only ripples with short scenes.

I completely avoided the so-called "American style." In my advocacy of the enthusiasm of "playing is playing, work is work," I am very suspicious as to whether I have over-portrayed that American-style "liveliness," "fun," and "bravery"?

For our warriors who pilot planes at ten thousand feet and have to decide "you die or I live" within minutes or even seconds, should we allow them to laugh more, jump more, and relax their over-tense nerves a little when they rest on the ground? Perhaps there is some reason for that?

In the sky, hasn't the loyal and fearless fighting spirit of our aerial heroes already shone in the world's amazement and admiration?

"A Thousand Miles of Sky" took three years to complete. From this, one can imagine the hardships and torments we suffered during filming. Under the stubborn belief of "reluctantly making do," during the long three years, my colleagues and I shed a lot of sweat and a little blood, perhaps sprinkling a few tears of heroes that no one saw, if heroes also shed tears.

When I picked up my pen to write a few words on the day the film was completed, I really felt a sense of having a thousand threads to pull. I remember reciting a few lines of English poetry by Byron more than ten years ago, which meant:

"If all the thoughts, feelings, sorrows, angers... in my chest

Could be expressed in one word,

And that word were "electricity," I would say it;

Otherwise, I would rather not say it, and put my thoughts,

Like a sharp sword, back into its scabbard!"

Finally, we would like to offer a sincere and enthusiastic slogan to the promising young people of the country: "Go to the sky!"
