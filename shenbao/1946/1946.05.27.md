### The Great Traitor Wang Yintai and 14 Others Were Escorted from Beiping to Beijing Yesterday for Trial, with Crowds Lining the Streets Cursing Non-Stop

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 26th] The great traitor Wang Yintai and 14 others were escorted to Beijing this morning. When the group of traitors had their blood pressure checked at 5 AM this morning, they realized they were being escorted to Beijing for trial. They hurriedly wrote "last letters" to their families, mostly advising them not to worry, but with a sense of reluctance to leave. Wang Shijing and Yu Jinhe, who were detained at Wang's residence, were temporarily taken to the Army Prison to assemble for departure. Wang Yintai was designated "Yu Character Number One," handcuffed together with Jiang Kanghu, and divided into seven pairs as they walked out of the prison. Wang Yintai wore a gray Western suit, while the others wore long robes. Yin Rugeng was wearing a vest, looking somewhat like a clown. Zhou Zuoren's bald head and clothes were the most worn. The best dressed was Wang Shijing, in silk robes and Western leather shoes. Compared to Zhou, onlookers sighed and said, "Even as a traitor, he still gets to head the finance department." The expressions of the traitors varied as they emerged from prison. Wang Yintai seemed quite shy, keeping his head down as much as possible, pulling his felt hat down, making it difficult for photographers. The others were relatively calm, with Wang Shijing in the best spirits. Before getting into the car, reporters asked each one for their thoughts. Wang Yintai said, "The whole of North China knows about my affairs, I have no thoughts." Zhou Zuoren said, "I have been waiting to be arrested all along, I have no thoughts." Zhou has lost weight and his attitude remains "indifferent." Yu Jinhe said, "Punishment is right, but I hope our actions will be investigated in detail." Qi Xieyuan said arrogantly, "I have never done anything wrong, Chairman Chiang also said I am strict and old." The escorting soldiers were very polite to him, and Qi lectured the escorting soldiers in the tone of an instructor, recounting his "glorious history" when he was with Marshal Wu. He also said how they should conduct themselves. Tang Yangdu said, "I have saved more than forty underground workers." The group of traitors traveled by military truck to the airport, with crowds lining the streets, spitting, cursing, and shouting non-stop, while their family members were mixed among them, shedding tears. Before boarding the plane, each person was weighed. The large Tang Yangdu was the heaviest, at 90 kilograms, while the scholar Zhou Zuoren was the lightest, at 52 kilograms. Each person was allowed to carry 15 kilograms of belongings, mostly clothing, bedding, books, and sewing kits. Zhou carried his own book, "Tan Shi Ji," while Yu Jinhe carried the Diamond Sutra. At around 10:30 AM, the group of traitors departed from Beiping, where they once wielded power and influence. It is also learned that the traitors in prison are allowed to see their families once a month, receive items once, and the most money is sent by the economic traitor Zou Quansun, 200,000 yuan each time, and the least is Zhou Zuoren, 5,000 yuan each time. Furthermore, according to Deng Zhexi, President of the Hebei High Court, the sentence of a person convicted of treason is calculated from the date of their arrest.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 26th] The great traitors Wang Yintai, Jiang Kanghu, Qi Xieyuan, Yu Jinhe, Yin Rugeng, Pan Yugui, Wang Shijing, Tang Yangdu, Wen Zhimu, Zhou Zuoren, Chen Zengshi, Wang Mo, Liu Yushu, Zou Quansun and 14 others were escorted by Ni Chaofan, Director of the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters, at 10:45 AM on the 26th, and were transferred to Nanjing for trial by plane.

### The Original Text of the Re-Trial Approval of Chen Bijun's Life Sentence

[Central News Agency, Suzhou Correspondent] Jiang Chen Bijun, the traitorous wife of the great traitor Wang Zhaoming of the puppet Nanjing government, was sent by the Military Affairs Commission to the Suzhou High Court for investigation and trial. On April 22nd, she was sentenced to life imprisonment, deprived of civil rights for life, and all her property, except for a reasonable amount for the necessary living expenses of her family, was confiscated. Upon hearing the verdict, Chen stated in court that she did not accept it, but did not want a re-trial. Her daughter, Wang Wenxun, appealed on behalf of her mother, requesting a re-trial. The Suzhou High Court also submitted a request for review. The Supreme Court rendered its verdict on May 17th, with the main text stating: "The original judgment is approved, and she is still sentenced to life imprisonment." The re-trial document has arrived in Suzhou and has been sent to the defendant, and the execution will be carried out in the Jiangsu Third Prison at Shizikou on a scheduled date. This female traitor will be imprisoned for life. The original text of the Supreme Court's re-trial document is recorded below:

Special Criminal Judgment of the Supreme Court, Jing Te Fu No. 139 of the 35th Year. Defendant Chen Bijun, female, 56 years old, residing at No. 30, Fazheng Road, Guangzhou City.

The defendant listed above was sentenced by the Jiangsu High Court on April 22nd, 35th year of the Republic of China, for the crime of treason, and sent for re-trial. The judgment of this court is as follows:

(Main Text) The original judgment is approved.

(Reasons) The defendant in this case, Chen Bijun, is the wife of the late traitor Wang Zhaoming, and was originally a member of the Central Supervisory Committee of the Kuomintang. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, she initially followed Wang to Chongqing. Later, due to the initial setbacks in our war effort, Wang's will weakened, and he colluded with Japanese chieftain Konoe Fumimaro, secretly seeking peace. The defendant also participated in the deliberations. In December of the 27th year of the Republic of China, she followed Wang from Chongqing to Hanoi, Vietnam. First, she sent Chen Gongbo and others to Hong Kong to publish a flashy telegram in response to Konoe's proposed three principles of peace. Then, she and Wang traveled from Hanoi to Hong Kong, and then to Shanghai to negotiate the basic plan for Sino-Japanese peace with the enemy. On March 30th of the 29th year of the Republic of China, they organized the puppet National Government in Nanjing. Wang served as the puppet chairman, and the defendant served as a member of the puppet National Party Central Supervisory Committee and a member of the puppet Central Political Committee. She was also assigned to guide and liaise with the puppet party, government, and military affairs in the southwestern provinces. She and her younger brother, the late puppet Governor of Guangdong Province, Chen Yaozu, under the command of Japanese enemies Yazaki and Sakai, handled Guangdong's political affairs until the enemy surrendered before being dismissed from her position. These facts were repeatedly confessed by the defendant and are consistent with the statements of Chen Gongbo and Chu Minyi in other cases. There are also seized special appointment letters and identity cards issued by the enemy military intelligence agency and the Guangdong Provincial Government, as well as telegrams from Chen Yaozu to the defendant using the code names "Cliff" and "Hua" to report and request instructions, which are sufficient to prove that she colluded with the enemy country and plotted to resist this country, and the facts are extremely obvious. The defendant's defenses were nothing more than saying that Wang initially agreed with the war of resistance, but later saw that the war could not be sustained and China could not be saved, and that the opportunity for peace had arrived, so he still upheld his long-held ambition to save the country and the people and resolutely advocated peace. He repeatedly suggested this, but the central government never adopted it, so he had no choice but to leave Chongqing and discuss peace terms with the Japanese invaders. His mission was more complicated and arduous than the war of resistance. As for the organization of the puppet National Government, it was because there was a temporary government in the north and a restoration government in the south at that time, and the powers could not be unified, and the people were in dire straits, so this move had to be taken. Wang did not dare to call himself chairman, but used the name of acting chairman to preside over government affairs, and it is very clear that he had no intention of resisting this country. After the July 7th Incident, our government adopted the long-term war of resistance as its national policy and repeatedly announced it to China and foreign countries. However, Wang's will was weak, and when he saw the initial setbacks in the war, his confidence wavered sharply. Without waiting for the government's orders or consent, he brazenly made peace with the enemy chieftain. The basic plan for Sino-Japanese peace that he signed was full of terms that humiliated the country and forfeited its sovereignty. The fact that he colluded with the enemy country cannot be explained away, no matter how much he tries. Although various coastal areas successively fell, our government still existed. Wang actually organized a puppet government in Nanjing with the support of the enemy, forming a confrontational situation with the central government. It cannot be said that he had no intention of resisting this country. The defendant participated in the planning of Wang's plan, and also took on important positions. She cannot escape the crime of colluding with the enemy country and plotting to resist this country. The defendant's assertion that Wang's advocacy of peace was aimed at saving the country is self-deception. As for the defendant's preservation of many valuable specimens and various books for the Central Research Institute in Guangdong, and her efforts to negotiate with the enemy to stabilize rice prices and save 400,000 refugees, regardless of whether these claims are true, still need to be proven. Even if they are not false, they have no impact on the establishment of the crime. The original judgment held that the defendant's actions should bear the responsibility for colluding with the enemy country and plotting to resist this country. Because of her relationship with Wang, she echoed her husband's schemes without realizing it, which is fundamentally different from ordinary crimes. It is not entirely unforgivable for her to face death. Except for the section where the defendant was in charge of special operations in the Southwest, which was deemed that the crime could not be proven and was not discussed, the first article, the first item of the second article, the first item of the eighth article, the ninth article of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors, the first paragraph of the second article, the twenty-eighth article, and the thirty-seventh article, the court sentenced her to life imprisonment, deprived her of civil rights for life, and confiscated all her property except for a reasonable amount for the necessary living expenses of her family, which is in accordance with the law and should be approved.

Based on the above conclusions, the judgment is made according to the first paragraph of the twentieth article of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations, as in the main text.

Criminal Second Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Republic of China on May 17, 35th year. Chief Judge Zhang Yuzhi, Judge Yin Yuebo, Judge Lin Shangbin, Judge Luo Renji, Judge Chen Shicheng.

### Two Important Japanese War Criminals Who Invaded China, Sakai and Takahashi, Have Been Arrested, Evidence is Being Collected and Public Prosecution is Imminent

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Japanese war criminals Sakai Takashi and Takahashi Tane, were members of the Japanese army dedicated to invading China. From the 26th to the 35th year of the Republic of China, Sakai Takashi served as the Chief of Staff of the Tianjin Japanese Garrison Army, and Takahashi Tane served as the Japanese Military Attaché in Beiping. At that time, Japan was attempting to separate the five provinces of North China from the central government. Sakai and Takahashi were important members of the execution of this policy. On the one hand, they sheltered drug trafficking and smuggling, disrupting social economy and security, and on the other hand, they used various vicious and sinister means to oppress and threaten the military and political authorities in North China. Their overbearing, arrogant, unreasonable attitude and actions were truly unbearable. At that time, Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin served as the Acting Chairman of the Beiping Branch of the Military Commission, and knew this in great detail. After the Lugouqiao Incident, Sakai Takashi was promoted to the Commander of the 43rd Army and the Commander of the Hong Kong Garrison Army. Takahashi Tane was promoted to the Chief of Staff of the North China Front Army, commanding operations on the Chinese battlefield. Their crimes against Chinese and foreign people are innumerable. Sakai Takashi had already been arrested by the Army Headquarters and detained in the war criminal detention center. Takahashi Tane was also detained by the Army Headquarters on the 25th and sent to the war criminal detention center. The military court has now collected various pieces of evidence and is about to file a public prosecution for trial in accordance with the law.

### Foreign Minister Wang's Remarks

Unlimited Joy at Philippine Independence

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] An Associated Press reporter recently visited Foreign Minister Wang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inquire about the Chinese side's feelings regarding the inauguration of the new Philippine President Roxas. Foreign Minister Wang made the following remarks: There are close relationships in terms of blood, economy, and culture between the people of China and the Philippines, so the Chinese people and government feel infinitely happy about the independence of the Filipino people. President Roxas will be the first president after the independence of the Philippines, and like his predecessors, Interim President Quezon and Osmena, he will continue to work for democratic politics and international cooperation. I hope that our overseas Chinese in the Philippines will continue to contribute to the Philippines as they have done in the past, and do their best to support the Philippine government, so that President Roxas's various efforts can be successfully completed. The success of the new president will not only affect the welfare of the Filipino people, but also have an inestimable positive impact on the hundreds of millions of people in the Pacific region and on the Asian continent who are struggling for independence, freedom, and national self-determination.

### Qinghai Military Training Corps Cultivates Intermediate Cadres

Six Hundred People Serving on American Ships

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 26th] China's naval construction is moving forward. Here, the Central Naval Training Corps, with the assistance of American advisors, is cultivating intermediate cadres. Six hundred people have already been sent to serve on American landing ships. More than twenty landing ships and other warships have already been docked at Qingdao port, and are being handed over to the Chinese Navy for use. After graduating from the Naval Academy, members of the Sea Training Corps come to Qingdao for training. The scale is similar to that of a naval specialized school, divided into Radar, Navigation, Anti-Submarine, Electrical, Mechanical, Signals, Gun, Artillery, Torpedo, Ship Police, and Wireless Telegraph classes. In addition to lecturing on new naval tactics and related sciences, American advisors provide practical guidance on new naval equipment. They express great admiration for the spirit of Chinese naval officers undergoing training and their hard work.

### The Story of the Arrest of Enemy Spy Zhang Xiaolong in Nanjing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The traitor Zhang Xiaolong was arrested in this city on the 25th. It is reported that the traitor's ancestral home is Nanling, Anhui, and he moved to Shenyang. He graduated from the Japanese Imperial University. After the fall of Nanjing, he went to Tunxi to work in the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Transportation Committee, and later went to Hong Kong. In the 31st year, he went to Shanghai to join the enemy, and served as the Chief of the Secret Service of the Shanghai Enemy Gendarmerie and a translator for the Mei Kikan. He plotted to harm many underground workers of our party. The arrest of Mr. Jiang Bocheng and Mrs. Yang Hu was also due to his secret reports. He was extremely lecherous and frequented dance halls, spending lavishly. After the victory, relying on his cousin Zhang Yan's involvement in the handover at the Logistics Department, he got to know Wang Zhuozhang, the director of the department. Because he had money, he was appointed as the Lieutenant Colonel Deputy Warehouse Chief of a certain warehouse in Zhenjiang in the Logistics Department under the false name of Wu Xinhua (this is his confession). He always carried two short guns and an orderly, and had his own Jeep. A week ago, he came to Nanjing and stayed at the Oriental Hotel, and then moved to Zijin Lane in Dawa Lane. A certain agency had been tracking him and saw him entertaining guests at the Paris Restaurant. An officer believed that the time was ripe, so he led several plainclothes agents to the restaurant to arrest him. When the officer drew his gun, the traitor tried to snatch the gun and escape. The officer's hands were scratched, and after a two-minute struggle, he was finally arrested. Among those sitting with the traitor at the Little Paris Restaurant yesterday were Director Yu of the Nanjing Office of the Central Military Academy, and the traitor's wife, siblings, and eight other people.

### The Government Area Intensifies its Efforts on the Yellow River Blocking and Restoration Project, with Most of the Bank Protection Project Completed

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 25th] After the National Water Conservancy Commission and representatives of the Chinese Communist Party reached an agreement in Nanjing on the Yellow River blocking and restoration project, it was decided to start construction separately on June 5th. The embankment restoration project in the government area that has already started is being intensified. The Huayuankou blocking project is currently underway, but the closing must be done after the entire embankment restoration project is completed, and it is difficult to close before the flood season. Another important task of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission is to protect the flood banks and Shahe embankments to prevent the expansion of the flood area. Chairman Zhao Shouyu went to Zhoukou on the 24th to inspect the Shahe embankment protection situation and presided over a meeting in Zhoukou to requisition construction materials. He will return to Huayuankou in the coming days to supervise the work. It is reported that 70% of the Shahe embankment protection project has been completed and can be completed by the end of June. The breaches at Guodang and Da Wu on the eastern Yellow River embankment have been repaired and the embankment protection work is underway. The embankment protection project on the western Yellow River embankment has also been 60% completed. It is expected that the embankment protection project will be completed soon, and the flood area will not expand during the flood season.

### Aiding China in Establishing a Textile Industry to Restore Export Markets, Claims President of the American Textile Export Association

(United Press, New York, 25th) Mr. Vanderhoof, president of the American Textile Export Association, told a United Press reporter that to help China restore its pre-war export markets, we should assist China in establishing its textile industry. At the same time, Japan should not be supplied with sufficient raw cotton to engage in large-scale textile manufacturing. Mr. Vanderhoof stated that the raw cotton supplied to Japan should not exceed 35% of its domestic needs. These manufactured goods, comprising 35%, should be distributed to various countries in the Far East. Mr. Vanderhoof believes that allowing Japan to monopolize the world textile market again would enable Japan to acquire armaments for waging war.

### Special Broadcast by the American Foreign Policy Association Debates the China Situation: Vincent, Judd, Tracy

[US News Service, Springfield, Massachusetts, 25th] Mr. Vincent, Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Department of the State Department, Congressman Judd, a Republican from Minnesota, and Congressman Tracy, a Democrat from Washington (both highly regarded experts on China issues), tonight discussed on National Broadcasting Company radio, in this city, the problems the United States faces in completing the process of a "unified and democratic China" as stipulated in last December's Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers from the United Kingdom, America and the Soviet Union. This broadcast was one in a series of programs by the National Broadcasting Company on "Our Foreign Policy" and was a special broadcast from this location by the Foreign Policy Association during its meeting on Thursday. The debate between Congressman Judd and Congressman Tracy centered on the issue of responsibility for the recent split between the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Mr. Vincent adopted an objective viewpoint, summarizing the policies and motivations of the US government as follows:

"Our efforts to assist China in achieving peace and unification are not solely based on altruism. These efforts are actually to promote national and international interests, because the lack of unity in China encouraged the Japanese aggressors in 1931 and directly caused our full-scale war in 1941. Congressman Judd pointed out that it is absolutely true that we must advocate for China's independence and the integrity of its territory and administration, but we cannot solely rely on the Open Door Policy and the Nine-Power Treaty. We must actively strive to create a strong and unified China. The current question is not whether our efforts will immediately achieve China's unification, but whether we can abandon our efforts in view of the obvious difficulties. I believe that, as Marshal Marshall advocates, the policy of working towards China's unification through peaceful means, its reverse is to support the existing government to achieve unification by force, but forceful unification contains the undesirable possibility that China will be divided into two opposing camps, which will seriously hinder all constructive policies in the Far East.

"Therefore, I deeply feel that we should maintain a neutral position, without favoring any political party in China, and support General Marshall's arduous work so that the United States, China, and the international community can all greatly benefit." All the speakers trust Marshal Marshall, because his work has made progress, and he has indicated that he can help China resolve the current situation. The speakers also reviewed China's internal difficulties. Mr. Vincent said that before the President's policy statement in December last year was issued, the President had discussed it in detail with Marshal Marshall. The President's policy statement in December: to urge China to stop internal strife, organize a coalition government, and unify military commands, is the main goal of the United States in China. Mr. Vincent said that the issue of ceasing the civil war was discussed at that time. The truce negotiations concluded on January 10, deciding to cease all military conflicts and military movements. In addition, the Chinese government also convened the Political Consultative Conference in Chongqing, and representatives from various parties and factions participated, including representatives from the Communist Party and the China Democratic League. When asked what agreements the Consultative Conference had reached, Mr. Vincent replied: The Consultative Conference decided to organize a coalition government and formulate a democratic constitution, guaranteeing freedom of person, speech, assembly, and publication, and recognizing that all political parties have equal legal status. In addition, agreements were reached on holding elections and promoting local autonomy. The Political Consultative Conference was a comprehensive meeting for China and a major step for China towards democracy. The speakers then mentioned the reasons for the resurgence of internal strife in China after the Consultative Conference. Congressman Judd pointed out: "The CCP has repeatedly violated the agreements." Mr. Tracy said: "Both sides are to blame for the resurgence of internal strife. I believe it is a fact that the Kuomintang side has violated the agreement more often."

Mr. Tracy said: "I believe the United States should use all its strength and prestige to promote peace in China and should not favor any party during the civil war." Congressman Judd said: "Since the current situation is so complicated and threatens world peace, I believe that for the sake of the parties involved, if they can agree, the Northeast of China can be temporarily placed under the joint rule of the United Nations before the true unification of China is realized." Mr. Tracy said: "We should not forget that the people of Northeast China have been under the iron heel of the Japanese since 1931, for a longer time than anyone else in China. They are eager to gain freedom, and they do not want to be conquered by foreigners again, even if their new conquerors are Chinese." Mr. Tracy then said: "There are major reasons for the breakdown of the truce agreement. I believe this matter cannot be clearly separated from the great power politics of the world. If the great powers fail to cooperate to seek peace, especially the United States and the Soviet Union, if they fail to work together, how can we expect China or anyone inclined towards fascism to be willing to give up any rights they have enjoyed for a long time?" Mr. Vincent then reviewed the policies of the United States and the Soviet Union in China. He said: "Our policy naturally regards the central government as the legal government of China. The assistance we give to China is aimed at the central government, not the Communist Party. The Soviet Union's policy is also the same, as can be seen from the agreement signed between the Soviet Union and the central government in August last year. However, in any case, the assistance we provide to the central government is certainly not intended to be used for internal war." Regarding the issue of the former Japanese factories in Northeast China, Mr. Vincent said: "We have lodged a strong protest with the Soviet Union against the removal of the factories of the former Japanese in Northeast China. They have a different interpretation of the spoils of war (they refer to these industries as spoils of war), and it is completely wrong. The disposal of factories operated by the former Japanese should be governed by the Allied overall compensation agreement, and this is not a matter for any one country." As for the attitude of American public opinion towards the future of China, Mr. Vincent said: "American public opinion urgently hopes that China can produce a democratic coalition government and unanimously recognize that the Soviet Union should cooperate to formulate a policy towards China and the entire Far East."

Editorial

### Pauley's Mission to the East

President Truman's special envoy for reparations issues, Mr. Pauley, commissioned to come to the Far East to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the materials and industrial equipment in Korea and Northeast China, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. According to Pauley's statement to the press when he arrived in Tokyo on the 10th of this month, "The main task of this trip to the Far East is to investigate the scope of the industrial equipment removed by the Soviet Union from that region. All assets previously owned by Japan within China and Korea should belong to those countries. This is the goal of American policy." From this, we can see the importance of Pauley's mission. Before Pauley set off for the East, the American media believed that Pauley's investigation would cause a conflict of economic interests between the United States and the Soviet Union in the Far East. Later, Pauley entered the Soviet-occupied area of northern Korea from the US-occupied area of southern Korea on the 16th to carry out investigation work. On the 24th, he flew from Seoul to Nanjing, the capital of our country, to visit our authorities, discuss active investigation methods, and frankly stated to the press: "The heavy industrial equipment in the Northeast has been completely removed by the Soviet Union, and it is difficult to hope that things can be returned to their original places." When he said this, he could not help but feel a little frustrated. When we heard this, we felt even more melancholy and disappointed.

Regarding the Northeast issue, it was resolved as early as the Cairo Conference. In the declaration jointly issued by the three giants, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang, it was publicly announced that Northeast China, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Islands would be returned to China. After President Roosevelt returned to the country, he reported on the long-term plan for the Far East decided at the Cairo Conference, which also included the principle of "returning property to its original owners." Therefore, after Japan surrendered, we all thought that the withdrawal of Soviet troops and the takeover of the Northeast by the Chinese government would not be a problem, but we did not know that the secret Yalta Agreement already existed, which imposed some restrictions on our country's restoration of sovereignty over the Northeast: (1) Dalian was opened as an international port, and the Soviet Union retained preferential rights; Lushun was leased by the Soviet Union as a naval base; (2) the Chinese Eastern Railway and the South Manchurian Railway were jointly managed by China and the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union retained preferential rights. In order to appease people, the Chinese government followed the provisions of the secret Yalta Agreement, at the cost of significant compensation, and signed a treaty of friendship between the two countries in order to maintain peace in the Far East. However, the ink on the Sino-Soviet treaty was not yet dry, and the Soviet Union's actions in the Northeast that violated the agreement were endless. The most incomprehensible thing is that the Soviet Union removed all the heavy industrial equipment in the Northeast, leaving only an empty shell for us to take over. According to estimates by American mining experts, the industrial equipment removed by the Soviet Union from the Northeast is worth at least 500 million US dollars. If China wants to replenish this equipment, it will take at least two years. However, the Soviet Union took this action and claimed that "all Japanese enterprises in the Northeast provinces that once served the Kwantung Army should be regarded as spoils of war of the Soviet Army." This kind of sophistry has no sufficient reason and violates international law, no wonder it will cause protests from our country and interference from the United Kingdom and the United States.

First, on February 9th of this year, US Secretary of State Byrnes sent notes to the governments of China and the Soviet Union, stating two things: (1) Opposing the joint management of Northeast industry by China and the Soviet Union, the current negotiations between the two countries are tantamount to violating the United States' "Open Door" policy; (2) Northeast industry and the Japanese reparations issue are closely related, and they cannot be regarded as spoils of war and removed. Later, the United Kingdom followed the example of the United States and made the same representations to the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Union has always ignored it, so the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union are in a stalemate on this issue. On the British and American side, it is argued that the industrial equipment removed by the Soviet army in the Northeast should be used as capital for Japanese reparations; while the Soviet Union believes that this is the spoils of war of the Soviet army and can be removed, and the remaining industry should be jointly operated by China and the Soviet Union. The two sides each held their own views and refused to give in, forming a serious international problem in the Far East.

As for our country's attitude towards this issue, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie had already announced to the outside world: "China has resisted the longest and suffered the greatest losses, so China should enjoy a superior proportional amount in the total amount of Japanese reparations to the Allied countries; and should have the right to obtain priority. All Japanese public and private industries within China should be regarded as part of Japan's reparations to China." At the same time, China also expressed its disagreement with the Soviet Union's view that Northeast industry was the spoils of war of the Soviet army, and has formally notified the United Kingdom and the United States, which has won praise from the British and American press. For example, the London Times reported: "We have always believed that China has been ravaged by Japanese aggression and is the holder of sovereignty over the nine northeastern provinces, so the legitimate custodian of this industrial equipment is none other than China." The British Labour Party's Daily Herald also reported: "After this matter is investigated, it can be proved that most of the factories in the Northeast are not owned by Japan, but are the legitimate property of China." From this, we can see that our country's position is justified and strong, and cannot be overturned; we hope that Pauley will come to China, and will listen to the opinions of the government and the public in our country.

Let us put aside the legal and historical factors for the time being, and observe it from an economic point of view alone. The Soviet Union's removal of industrial equipment from the Northeast is not very beneficial to the Soviet Union itself, but just a pile of scrap metal. But if it is not removed and remains in place, it will be of great benefit to the local economy. Therefore, Pauley said: "The United States wants this equipment and materials to continue to produce for local security and world peace; and believes that if this equipment remains in place, its value will be 100%, and once it is moved, its value will be less than one-tenth of the original." The Soviet Union's removal of industrial equipment from the Northeast is really a "harmful and unprofitable" thing. After Pauley conducts an on-the-spot investigation in the Northeast, he should try to "return things to their original places" to realize the American proposition, that is, he must allow all kinds of industrial equipment that can affect the economy of the Northeast to be allowed to be moved. Pauley said that it is difficult to hope that things can be returned to their original places, isn't that too pessimistic? Man proposes, God disposes. Aren't sixty-two American celebrities and scholars shouting loudly, demanding the abandonment of the secret Yalta Agreement?

In short, the Northeast industrial equipment issue is the most important part of the Japanese reparations issue. If the United Kingdom and the United States and the Soviet Union cannot reach a consensus on this issue, then the Japanese reparations issue will be even more difficult to resolve. Recently, the US-Soviet Commission in Korea discussed the unification of the north and south occupied areas, and it broke up again unhappily. It is obvious that the United States and the Soviet Union are standing in an opposing position everywhere in the Far East. If this sad situation is not remedied, the consequences will be endless and unimaginable. All people who are eager for the Far East to live in peace after the war are eager for the United States and the Soviet Union to cease their disputes and be able to treat each other sincerely in everything without suspecting each other, then all disputes can be easily resolved. British Prime Minister Attlee gave a speech yesterday, calling for world peace and asking mankind to eliminate individual selfishness, partisan selfishness, and national selfishness. If the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union can truly do this, then international cooperation will not be difficult to achieve. Today's Far East is like today's world. The summary of the problem is entirely that the Soviet Union's arbitrary actions have caused the United Kingdom and the United States to distrust, or at least not understand. Former US Undersecretary of State Welles openly criticized the unstable situation in the Far East as being entirely due to the failure of the US and the Soviet Union to reach an understanding, which is especially to the point. Therefore, in addition to hoping that Pauley can complete his mission, we also hope that Pauley can do more and do more work to promote the understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union in order to break the current Far Eastern deadlock, which will not only benefit the Far East, but also have a great benefit to world peace.

Hangzhou

Silk Farmer Commits Suicide Due to Debt

In Linping Town, Hangzhou County, this year, farmers enthusiastically raised spring silkworms, but mulberry leaves were expensive, costing over ten thousand yuan per dan (a unit of weight), forcing them to borrow money to buy leaves. Unexpectedly, after harvesting the cocoons, the price of cocoons fell, resulting in significant losses. Recently, a farmer surnamed Mou, facing urgent debt collection for the leaves, carried cocoons to the market to sell. However, the cocoon businesses all cited the decline in Shanghai silk prices and refused to buy, citing a lack of funds. The farmer returned with the cocoons, and the creditors remained, demanding payment. His wife, feeling pressured and desperate, hanged herself upstairs. It is indeed tragic.

City Gazetteer Compilation Office to Be Established Next Month

The Hangzhou Municipal Government, in order to compile the Hangzhou City Gazetteer, and in accordance with the recommendation of the Municipal Provisional Assembly, has decided to prepare for the establishment of a City Gazetteer Compilation Office. Chen Xiaodie has been appointed as the director, and the budget, estimated at one million yuan, has been prepared. They are currently searching for a suitable location and plan to establish the office on June 1st to begin work.

Salt Pan Destruction Leads to Lawsuit

The residents of Qibao Waitang, outside Genshanmen in this city, suffered the destruction of their homes due to a tidal surge in 1940. Unable to make a living, they relocated to the sandy land along the river in Shibao to set up salt pans to make a living. Recently, the salt authorities dispatched police to seal the salt pans, arrest salt workers, and confiscate salt. They ordered the salt workers to surrender their salt and issued a salt price of two thousand yuan. The salt workers, whose production costs were over a thousand yuan per dan, were alarmed. They petitioned the Hangzhou County Government Salt Production Cooperative to urgently seek a solution for their livelihood. The other day, the Minsheng Company, together with the Qibao office of the Salt Management Bureau, led police to the area, destroyed the salt pans, shattered the jars, and injured two women, Gong and Hu. This aroused public outrage, and representatives were elected to file a lawsuit with the Hangzhou District Court.

Suzhou

County Government Punishes Illegal Rice Merchants

The market price of grain in this county has recently fallen from over 60,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan, while the retail price remains at 57,000 to 58,000 yuan. This violates the county government's and the grain guild's regulations, which stipulate that a legal profit of no more than 2,000 yuan can be added to the market price. It is evident that unscrupulous merchants are seeking exorbitant profits. The county government, unwilling to remain silent on this situation, ordered the responsible department to send personnel to secretly investigate rice shops engaged in illegal operations. After confirming evidence against 24 rice shops, they were arrested and detained for over ten hours. On the afternoon of the 24th, they were released on bail by the entire grain guild. However, the county government stated that it would continue to investigate and prosecute them according to the law, without leniency.

Changshu

Tax Bureau's Obstruction Prompts Manufacturers to Petition

Cloth factories have recently faced various difficulties when taking their yarn tax bills to the goods tax bureau to exchange them after weaving cloth, which has affected production. On the 22nd, the factories sent 15 representatives to the tax bureau to petition, and also requested assistance from the Chamber of Commerce. However, the petition was unsuccessful that day. The tax bureau requires a tax of 300 yuan per bolt, while the manufacturers are only willing to pay 50 yuan, a significant difference. Furthermore, the Tobacco Industry Association stated that the goods tax bureau collected over 5.5 million yuan in inventory tax, which has been approved for exemption by the Ministry of Finance, but has not been refunded for three months. They have separately petitioned various authorities, appealing for redress.

Jiangyin

Requesting Grain Loans to Purchase Rice for Famine Relief

The Provisional County Assembly, noting that rice prices have been rising in various places, affecting the people's livelihood, and attributing the cause to frequent years of famine and a shortage of rice, as well as the procurement of military grain, which cannot meet demand, stated that the recent issuance of large grain loans in Shanghai was originally intended to help merchants and the people. However, grain merchants are using these large sums to hoard grain in nearby areas, stimulating grain prices and being the main cause of rising prices. On the 23rd, they telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Food, urging them to quickly use these large grain loans to purchase foreign rice to relieve the famine and stabilize rice prices.

Zhenjiang

Hygiene Shops Required to Register by Deadline

The Provincial Hygiene Office, in order to prevent infectious diseases, is managing hygiene-related shops, such as restaurants, candy stores, barbershops, bathhouses, teahouses, live rice and meat stores, sugar workshops, sauce workshops, inns, hotels, and entertainment venues. The persons in charge of each shop should apply for registration with the office from June 1st to June 30th. After passing the inspection, a hygiene license will be issued, allowing them to operate. Otherwise, they will be banned.

Standard Rent and Security Deposit Determined

Since the recovery of the provincial capital, serious panic has arisen. Homeowners regard their properties as rare commodities, arbitrarily raising rents and causing rental disputes. The Provisional Assembly of this county is paying great attention to this. On the 24th, an emergency meeting was held to propose two measures: (1) Based on the rent values in this county in 1937 and comparing them with the situations in Nanjing and Shanghai, the standard rent should be two-thirds lower. Referring to the recent discussions of the Shanghai Provisional Assembly, the rent should be 140 times the rate for residential properties and 180 times the rate for commercial properties. Therefore, the standard for calculating rent in this county should be three times the rent in 1937, and then, according to the Shanghai Provisional Assembly's proposed methods, residential rents should increase by 420 times, and commercial rents should increase by 540 times. (2) The security deposit should be standardized at three months' rent. This resolution has been recorded and notified to the Zhenjiang County Government for implementation.

### Railroad Strike Declared Resolved, US National Transportation Returns to Normal, Coal Mine Strike Truce Expires and Attracts Attention Again, Shipyard Workers Set Strike for Next Month

[US News Agency, Washington, 25th] The nationwide railroad strike, which began 48 hours ago, was declared resolved this afternoon. The announcement of the resolution of the railroad strike occurred almost simultaneously with the President's commencement of his speech at a joint session of Congress. The President, while reading his speech, was unaware that the strike had been resolved. Upon receiving the news, he stopped reading his speech and announced to Congress that the strike had been resolved. Railroads throughout the United States immediately resumed service after the strike was announced resolved. However, it is uncertain whether the morale of the workers will fully recover within a day or two. Mail delivery also returned to normal shortly after the strike was resolved. The news of the strike's resolution was announced by Presidential Advisor Steelman, who was the government-appointed representative attending the labor-management negotiations. The main points of the agreement to resolve the strike are: an increase of sixteen cents per hour, as recommended by the previous fact-finding committee, retroactive to January 1st of this year, plus an additional two and a half cents per hour, effective May 22nd, and an extension of the revised employee service regulations for one year.

[United Press, Washington, 25th] The two-day nationwide railroad strike was resolved after railroad unions accepted the President's terms, and declared resumption of work just before President Truman asked Congress to pass a transportation bill permitting penalties for strikes against government-seized industries. However, while the railroad strike has been resolved, the strike of 400,000 bituminous coal miners has again attracted attention. Interior Secretary Krug, the current manager of the seized bituminous coal mines, announced today that no agreement has been reached with the coal miners' union leader, Lewis. The two-week truce in the bituminous coal miners' strike expires today. Krug has appealed to the miners to continue working on Sunday while awaiting a solution. The temporary bill that President Truman requested Congress to pass to deal with the railroad strike is no longer needed, but the House of Representatives has passed the Senate's temporary bill at an extraordinary speed of 306 votes to 32. Its content is exactly as proposed by Truman, stipulating that union leaders who refuse to declare a resumption of work in industries seized by the government are subject to fines and imprisonment. Nationwide railroads have begun to restore normal operations, all emergency measures ordered by the government have been lifted, and post offices have also announced that they will resume normal operations.

[French News Agency, Washington, 25th] The Senate has passed a bill by a majority of 54 votes to 26, stipulating that workers who wish to strike must first announce it 60 days in advance through the relevant union, otherwise strikes are not allowed.

[French News Agency, Washington, 25th] American shipyard workers, who demanded a 30% wage increase but were denied, have scheduled a general strike to begin on June 15th. As a precaution, the Secretary of Labor has scheduled a meeting for the 29th of this month, bringing together representatives from various shipping companies, dockworkers' unions, and the wartime transportation bureau. The US government's position on this matter is currently unknown to outsiders.

### Truman's Speech to Congress Calls Labor Strife a National Disaster

[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th] President Truman delivered a vigorous speech calling on Congress to pass a "strong bill" to prevent labor unrest such as the railroad strike. He called this a "national disaster." Truman asked Congress to cooperate with him and "act quickly," and requested authorization to draft into service those who launch strikes against the government. He also accused the leaders of the two railroad mechanical and service workers' unions, Johnston and Whitty, of endangering the lives of the people and starving those awaiting aid.

### Attlee's Speech: To Obtain World Peace, Sacrifice Is Necessary, Mankind's Morality Has Declined Since the Great War

[French News Agency, 25th, Edinburgh, UK] British Prime Minister Attlee delivered a speech at the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, stating: The world wants peace, but fears war and pacifism. Pacifism merely evades responsibility and cannot bring peace. Only when all men, women, and children have a positive view of human life, and strive for all mankind with the spirit of sacrifice in wartime, can there be peace in the world. We have experienced two world wars, especially this "total war," which has caused a decline in human morality. In today's world, the spiritual evils caused by Hitlerism have not yet been cleared. Hitler denied truth and justice, lacked compassion and love. The Nazis liquidated millions of Jews, their cruelty is beyond description, and its poison continues to this day. Representatives from all countries gathered in San Francisco to reorganize the body of civilization and draft the United Nations Charter with lofty ideals, but we must continue to work hard before these ideals are realized. The world today needs spiritual pioneers, and the Labor Party in power is serving these people, knowing that your service to the church is essential for these people. All church beliefs need not be the same, unity must be consistent, so that the spiritual value of mankind can be expressed. The thoughts of personal selfishness, party selfishness, and national selfishness can also be eliminated through personal example.

### UN Under-Secretary-General Hosts Polish Guest, Soviet Union Protests

[United Press, New York, 25th] United Nations Under-Secretary-General Hissunton hosted Polish General Komorowski for lunch yesterday, expressing a welcome on behalf of the United Nations. Soviet representative Gromyko issued a serious protest tonight, saying that Hissunton had no right to welcome guests on behalf of the United Nations, and this action not only concerned the United Nations staff, but also hindered the United Nations itself. General Komorowski's poor record is well known, and he is an enemy of the Polish people. Polish representative Uqi also protested the matter. At the same time, the United Nations Secretariat Information Department issued a statement that Secretary-General Laiyi declared that no matter what language Hissunton used, he had no right to speak on behalf of the United Nations.

### Italy and Austria Restore Diplomatic Relations

### UK-Soviet Alliance Fourth Anniversary, Bevin Cables Soviet Foreign Minister Congratulations

[This newspaper report] London, broadcast on the 26th: Today is the fourth anniversary of the UK-Soviet alliance. Bevin cabled Molotov, stating: More thorough understanding and cooperation are needed between the major powers.

### British Handling of Polish Military, Soviet Newspaper Writes Criticism, British Political Circles Express Indignation

[Reuters, Moscow, 26th] Fiktorov, the international editor of Pravda, wrote an article yesterday condemning Britain's attempt to retain the Polish Second Group Army stationed in Italy "for the future." He stated: British Foreign Secretary Bevin's statement to the House of Commons last Wednesday that the Polish Second Group would be transferred to Britain, preparing to be incorporated into the armed "residential group" of Fei, and then allowed to engage in occupations in Britain or overseas, is actually the so-called Fei's repatriation, which is still retaining its organization "under a new name."

[Reuters, London, 26th] The text of the Moscow Pravda criticizing Britain's handling of the Polish military has caused surprise and indignation among British politicians. They believe that British Foreign Secretary Bevin has made every effort to urge them to return to Poland, and now he can only find ways to move them to autonomous territories, France, and South America. Therefore, Pravda's reproach is groundless.

### Resolution Agreed on for British-Polish War Debt Issue, Agreement to be Signed Next Week

This is because a mass grave was recently discovered in Lauko Lo, 16 miles from Chongsamarinda on the east coast. It was in a mine pit, sealed with cement, so the Japanese were arrested.

### Rumors that Iranian Azerbaijan Railway Still Under Soviet Control, Azerbaijan Premier Does Not Allow Investigation Team to Inspect Barracks, Iranian Ambassador Visits US Undersecretary of State for Discussions

[Reuters, Delhi, 26th] It is rumored here that the government committee sent to Azerbaijan to investigate the Soviet troop withdrawal has reported that Russians wearing blue uniforms still control the Azerbaijan railway. However, government spokesman Firooz said that all railways have been returned by the Soviet side to the Iranian government or the Azerbaijan Democratic Party.

The government delegation returned to Delhi yesterday by Soviet plane. It is said that Azerbaijan Premier Bishivari warmly received them, but did not allow them to inspect the barracks. The report issued to the government by the delegation from Greater Britis was not agreed to by all representatives.

[Reuters, Continued, Rantong, 26th] Iranian Prime Minister Sadanar ordered yesterday to begin preparations for elections. The fifteenth parliament believes that since foreign troops have been completely withdrawn, there is no reason to delay the elections any longer.

[United Press, Washington, 25th] Iranian Ambassador to the United States, Arle, met today with US Deputy Secretary of State Erickson to discuss the Iranian-Soviet issue. Arle said: He has not received any new information about the situation in Azerbaijan, and the Iranian government has no way to obtain information about the developments in Azerbaijan except through Moscow.

### Dutch New Cabinet Difficult to Produce, Parties' Opinions Cannot Agree

[United Press, The Hague, 25th] The organization of the Dutch coalition government is becoming complicated due to differing views on imperial policy. The Catholic Party and the Labor Party cannot agree on Prime Minister Schermerhorn's East Indies policy. The Catholic Party is demanding the replacement of the current Colonial Minister Rochermont. As a result of last week's parliamentary election, the Catholic Party won 32 seats and the Labor Party won 29 seats. At the same time, Queen Wilhelmina once discussed the formation of a new government with party leaders. The Catholic Party requested to obtain the positions of Minister of Education, Trade, Industry, and Arts and Sciences.

### British-Indian Negotiations Stall

[This newspaper report] London, broadcast on the 26th: After the British Cabinet delegation to India issued its second declaration, neither the Congress Party nor the Islamic side responded.

### British-Dutch Conduct Consultations on the Sumatra Situation

[Reuters, Batavia, 26th] Allied Supreme Commander in Southeast Asia, Mountbatten, and Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Van Mook, are now holding talks in Singapore to discuss the situation in Sumatra. The results are of great concern to people here. Indonesian Prime Minister Shari declared at the intelligence meeting yesterday that who can exercise de facto power in Sumatra is the main point of contention between the Dutch and the Indonesians. It is believed that the resolution on the military situation in Sumatra may affect this entire issue. Accelerating the withdrawal of Japanese troops currently under the control of the Allied forces will make the situation there even more acute, as the Dutch military strength in Sumatra is unknown, and the British strength is less than a division.

### Javanese Volcano Erupts

[Reuters, Batavia, 26th] Mount Semeru, near the east coast of Java, 12,057 feet high, began spewing ash and mud yesterday. So far, hundreds of houses have been destroyed, more than 370 acres of rice fields have been affected, and some areas have been flooded.

### Nuremberg Tribunal Drafts Verdict, Deciding the Fate of German War Criminals. Once Decided, There Is No Appellate Body, Only the Four-Power Control Council Has the Authority to Commute Sentences.

[United Press, Nuremberg, 25th] Six months ago, the trial of twenty-one high-ranking German Nazi officials began with accusations of initiating war and other crimes. To date, the prosecutors from various countries have made statements totaling no less than 2.5 million words, and the documentary evidence submitted is mountainous. The presiding judges will review each document carefully before drafting a verdict to determine the fate of each defendant and six organizations, as well as their roles in the Nazi government. After the verdict is delivered, there is no appellate body. However, the Four-Power Control Council for Germany has the authority to commute sentences and decide when and where the sentences will be carried out. At the beginning of this case, few participants knew how long it would last.

Overturning International Law. If the indictments from various countries had been strictly limited to war crimes and the massacre of millions of European civilians, the trial period could have been greatly shortened. However, in this trial, the United Nations is creating an environment that overturns recognized international law and treaties, including those who waged aggressive war, whether intentional or not. Therefore, the lengthy trial of German Nazism traces back to the Nazi Party's origins twenty-five years ago. Each defendant is accused of participating in a conspiracy to support Hitler and initiate aggressive wars.

Aggressors Are Guilty. In essence, the United Nations intends to prove that those who wage aggressive war are guilty, and those in power who support the initiation of aggressive war are also guilty. The entire apparatus that assisted in aggression, including the German cabinet and the General Staff, are considered criminal organizations. This vast plan has lengthened the trial time, requiring the study of extensive evidence of pre-war German politics. In addition, the evidence of numerous war crimes often lacks clear boundaries. However, these thousands of pages of testimony about pre-war Nazism provide a major lesson for Germans and people around the world. It is undeniable that if people willingly relinquish their political responsibility and accept propaganda that incites hatred and murder without question, the consequences can be seen here, which is the lesson to be learned. As for whether the countries of the world have sufficient interest to read the contents carefully, no one in Nuremberg will be able to answer this question.

### Protest Lodged Against French Intrusion into Siamese Territory

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 25th, United Press] The Siamese government announced that French troops have twice intruded into Siamese territory. Protests have been lodged with the United States, Britain, and the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The Siamese government hopes to resolve this matter through diplomatic channels.

### Clad in Brocade Robes and Wearing Silver Turbans, King of Transjordan Ascends the Throne. 101-Gun Salute, Military Parade, and 50-60 Roasted Whole Lambs to Feast Dignitaries.

[United Press, Amman, 25th] Transjordan, a nation with a history of 5,000 years and a population of 300,000, signed a treaty with Britain a month ago, ending the British mandate over Transjordan and establishing Abdullah as King. Abdullah formally ascended the throne this morning, immediately calling on all Arabs to unite and support him, and for all Arab nations to work together. As is customary for Muslim kings, he only ascended the throne and was not crowned. The actual enthronement ceremony lasted only fourteen minutes and was conducted entirely in Arabic. Among the dignitaries attending the enthronement ceremony were Arab League Secretary-General Azzam, Iraqi Regent Elai, officials from Lebanon, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and British diplomatic and military representatives, all wearing elaborate military uniforms and adorned with medals. The scene was grand and spectacular. Abdullah, dressed in gold and red brocade robes, with a gold-embroidered cloak and a silver-white turban, entered the throne room with dignity. Women were excluded from the palace; female journalists and wives of government officials were also excluded. As Abdullah entered the chamber, Prime Minister Hashim shouted "Long live the King" three times in Arabic. Abdullah then sat on a red chair, flanked by his cabinet members and foreign diplomats, such as Iraqi Said, British High Commissioner for Palestine Creech Jones, British Minister to Transjordan Kirkbride, and Saudi Arabian Minister to Palestine Kohaimi. Foreign Minister Shuraiqi delivered a brief speech praising Transjordan's efforts to unite the Arab nations, saying, "All Arabs worldwide are united and follow Your Majesty, with unprecedented loyalty." Outside the palace, the people cheered endlessly. An official then read out the revised points of the country's laws to the people. As soon as the reading was finished, a soldier from the Arab Legion fired a signal shot from a nearby rooftop. Captain Mis, a British officer of the Legion, waved a scarf to signal the royal artillery unit in the ancient Roman fort on a nearby hill, which fired a 101-gun salute. The King then led the dignitaries to the Marka airfield near Amman, where he inspected the 3,000 soldiers of the Arab Legion for the first time, as well as mechanized units, infantry, cavalry, and finally a camel corps in red, gold, and grass-green uniforms. At noon, the King hosted a banquet for 3,000 guests, with fifty to sixty roasted whole lambs served on large copper platters. After the banquet, the ceremony concluded.

### Franco-American Financial Agreement - Signature Still Pending

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 25th] Blum, the French economic envoy to the United States, recently told the press: Although the Franco-American financial agreement has been negotiated, it will take several days to sign. I had originally planned to return to Paris tomorrow, so I have had to postpone it for a few days. As a result of this morning's negotiations, there are still some clauses in the agreement that must be redrafted. I am not in a position to make any statement until the agreement is signed.

### Vitamin D Injections to Prevent Rickets in Infants

### Japanese Government Plans Economic Revival Project - Encouraging Small-Scale Industries with a Five-Year Plan

[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] The newly appointed Minister of Commerce and Industry, Niro Hoshijima, told a United Press reporter today that a five-year economic revival plan has been drafted. Major companies and military industries previously managed by financial groups will be divided into numerous independent small industries. These small industries will be adjusted according to the new plan to be interconnected. The Yoshida cabinet will encourage small-scale industries that require minimal capital and raw materials, and will utilize Japanese handicrafts to develop cottage industries. The Nagoya mat factory, which previously employed 10,000 workers, can now be decentralized to rural areas, with one factory specializing in producing wire, another specializing in producing steel strands, and another specializing in producing parts. In short, Japan is now seeking economic revival with the minimum standard, so that Japan can stand up again.

### The Soviet Union's New Five-Year Plan - Translated by Our Editorial Department

[United Press, New York] Today, the Soviet Union has become the source of all global disputes, whether political or economic. However, in recent months, international politics have obscured the global economic war. Everyone knows about the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plans. The first Five-Year Plan began in 1932, the second in 1937, and the third in 1940, which was interrupted by the war. But you should know that the Soviet Union is now embarking on its fourth, even greater, Five-Year Plan.

What does this new plan include?

According to reports released by Soviet officials, the fourth Five-Year Plan contains five major programs:

(1) Soviet industrial production will increase by 50% compared to pre-war levels;

(2) Mass production of consumer goods;

(3) Expanding the scientific field beyond the borders of the Soviet Union;

(4) Providing funding to develop new and old enterprises valued at 334 billion rubles;

(5) Modernization of Soviet military equipment.

Under the first item, increasing industrial production, the plan aims to increase Soviet steel production by 35% compared to pre-war levels. According to statements released by Soviet officials, the Soviet Union, in view of the restoration and development of the national economy, relies on the increase in steel production. Therefore, the Soviet Union plans to increase pig iron production to 19.5 million tons and steel production to 25.4 million tons. To expand the steel industry, the new plan aims to build 45 new blast furnaces, 45 new open-hearth furnaces, 180 new open-hearth furnaces and converters, 90 new smelting furnaces, and 104 rolling mills.

The fourth Five-Year Plan is expected to increase metal production as follows: steel production will increase 1.6 times compared to pre-war levels, aluminum will increase 2.6 times, zinc will increase 2.5 times, tin will increase 2.7 times, nickel will increase 1.9 times, copper will increase 2.7 times, aluminum will increase 2 times, and lead will increase 2.1 times.

In addition, the new plan aims to increase coal production to 250 million tons per year, oil production to 35.4 million tons, and electricity to 82 billion kilowatt-hours.

Soviet officials anticipate that by 1951, Soviet automobile production will reach 500,000 vehicles per year. In addition, increases in the production of trailers, machines, electrical equipment, and locomotives are also included in the new industrialization plan. At the same time, financial machine tools are expected to increase to 1.3 million units. According to Soviet economists, this number exceeds the number of machine tools in the United States in 1940 by 30%.

In agriculture, the plan not only aims to restore and develop agricultural production, but also to develop animal husbandry and soil conservation. According to figures released by the Soviet government, assuming the total agricultural production in 1932 during the first Five-Year Plan was 100, then the second plan in 1937 was 153, and the third plan in 1940 increased to 177. According to the latest plan, total agricultural production will increase to 225 by 1950. According to a Soviet official, "By the end of the five years, the total grain harvest will increase to 127 million tons, which is 7% more than in 1940."

In addition, sugar beet production will increase to 26 million tons, cotton to 3.1 million tons, flax to 800,000 tons, and sunflower seeds to 3.7 million tons. These figures represent an average increase of 11% to 39% compared to pre-war production.

The Soviet Union has proclaimed this new Five-Year Plan. Whether it will be completed as scheduled remains to be seen in 1951.

### Confirmation Measures for the Academic Records of Students Returning from Occupied Areas

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing] Recently, someone inquired about "students who originally studied at schools run by puppet organizations and transferred to inland schools in the rear before the victory of the War of Resistance, and who are now unable to submit academic credentials from their original schools. Is there a remedial measure to verify and confirm their academic records?" The response from the person in charge of the Ministry of Education is as follows: (1) Students who studied at specialized schools or above in the former occupied areas and who went to the rear during the War of Resistance and intended to continue their studies were distributed by the Ministry of Education to various schools as visiting students. After one year of visiting study, if their grades were satisfactory, they were allowed to change to regular students of the visiting school. The procedures were very simple. (2) If the students are unable to submit credentials from their original schools, they can provide details of the original school name, dates of enrollment and departure. If the high school diploma is unavailable, they can explain when they graduated from which school. The Ministry of Education can find a way to verify it. If the academic record is authentic, they can still be changed to regular students in accordance with the regulations. (Foolish)

### Private School Establishment Issues - Deputy Minister Hang of the Ministry of Education Expresses Views

[Minzhi News Agency, Nanjing] After the Nanjing Lindao University student unrest subsided, a reporter visited Hang Liwu, Deputy Minister of Education, in Nanjing. First, he raised the question that in today's era, when victory has long arrived, educational construction is the foundation of all kinds of construction. Will the Ministry of Education continue to adopt a very strict attitude towards the establishment of private schools, or will it relax the standards and encourage private education to improve and popularize national education? Deputy Minister Hang replied: The Ministry of Education will continue to handle the application procedures for the establishment of private schools at all levels in accordance with previous laws and regulations, and there will be no temporary changes. However, the Ministry of Education will continue to encourage private schools. The Ministry of Education does not support the establishment of new schools within one year, because it is already difficult to enrich and maintain existing schools at the beginning of the restoration. The reporter also discussed the issue of funds with Mr. Hang. If the school's funds are deposited in the national bank as required, then according to recent experience, the funds will be wiped out after a certain period due to the impact of prices, and the school will never have any funds. Has the Ministry of Education considered this? Mr. Hang replied that it is under consideration.

### Sichuan Province Reinstatement Association's Telegram Department Suggests: Safeguarding Sichuan's Culture and Education. The Ministry of Education Responds, Expressing Acceptance.

[Our Newspaper's Chongqing Special Dispatch] During the Anti-Japanese War, schools in the war zones moved inland, promoting both the quality and quantity of education in Sichuan Province. Now, as the entire country is being reinstated, a large number of schools and cultural institutions are leaving Sichuan. The Sichuan Province Reinstatement and Advancement Association, recognizing the significant impact this has on the development of Sichuan's education and culture, has submitted its opinions to the Ministry of Education. The Ministry has recently responded, comforting the people of Sichuan. The Association's letter to the Ministry and the Ministry's response are recorded below:

Association's Telegram: The Sichuan Province Reinstatement and Advancement Association's opinion telegram, briefly stated: Since the War of Resistance, schools of all levels and various cultural institutions across the country have moved to Sichuan, or have been newly established in Sichuan, resulting in an unprecedented development of Sichuan's culture and education. The number of students has increased annually, and illiteracy has decreased day by day, which is truly commendable. Now, as reinstatement is imminent, all schools and cultural and educational institutions that moved inland or were newly established due to the war will also move out in succession. Without proper planning, not only will Sichuan's culture and education decline sharply, but the losses to the country due to repeated relocations are unimaginable. This Association, assisting the government in reinstatement and construction, respectfully suggests to your ministry: (A) Regarding schools: (1) Please expand the departments of the National Sichuan University and Chongqing University as much as possible, and enhance their facilities to accommodate students who are unable to move out of Sichuan with other universities. (2) Please provide appropriate subsidies to Chengdu's West China Union University and Guanghua University to help them accommodate more students. (3) Please quickly establish the National Southern Sichuan University and Northern Sichuan University to replace Tongji University, Wuhan University, and Northeastern University, which are moving out, in order to cultivate talent widely. (4) Retain the National Chongqing Normal School and the Central Industrial School, and expand and establish various vocational schools as needed in various regions of Sichuan to cultivate technical talent to meet the needs of Sichuan's construction. (5) Please expand the provincial middle schools of Sichuan and private middle schools with outstanding achievements as much as possible, to accommodate students from Sichuan after the reinstatement of national middle schools and middle schools that moved to Sichuan. (B) Regarding science and culture: (1) Please temporarily establish a library, science museum, and museum of a certain scale in both Chengdu and Chongqing. (2) Please retain and continue to operate the scientific research institutions and equipment that moved to Sichuan from the central government as much as possible. (3) Retain the Central Hospital of Chongqing and the Central Public Hospital of Chengdu, and hand them over to Sichuan Province for management. The Relief Administration should allocate medical equipment, materials, and drug manufacturing equipment to improve national health. (C) Regarding cultural industries: (1) Retain and continue to operate the scientific instrument manufacturing plant established by the central government in Sichuan as much as possible. (2) Please order the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education and major bookstores to establish a joint printing plant in Sichuan to supply textbooks needed by schools at all levels in Sichuan. (3) Please retain and establish large-scale paper mills and ink manufacturing plants to meet the needs of government agencies, schools, and organizations. (4) Please establish factories to manufacture printing machines to avoid the difficulties and waste of transporting them from other places. (D) Regarding special circumstances: (1) Please allocate special funds to subsidize schools at all levels in Sichuan to treat professors and lecturers from other provinces who are retained, to prevent a shortage of teachers in Sichuan. (2) All buildings and equipment of schools and cultural institutions at all levels that moved to Sichuan and need to be reinstated should be transferred to Sichuan Province by donation or purchase at a fair price. (3) Please issue a clear decree and set up methods to encourage private individuals to build schools and other cultural institutions to develop culture and education in the inland regions. (4) Please allow Sichuan Province to send students abroad at its own expense, as well as self-funded students, to enrich the talent pool for various construction projects in the province. The above suggestions are all urgent matters for reinstatement. We respectfully request your review and approval.

Ministry of Education's Reply: The Ministry of Education's reply expressed acceptance, briefly stating: (A) Regarding schools: (1) Chongqing University has been ordered to establish a medical school. (2) Bulky furniture and equipment of schools that moved to Sichuan that do not need to be transported will be left behind as appropriate to enrich the equipment of schools in the rear. (3) The Central Industrial Vocational School, the Central Technical School, and the Women's Normal College will all remain in Sichuan. The establishment of more vocational schools above the junior college level will be considered after reinstatement. National middle schools, in addition to those returning to their respective provinces, will have four or five retained in Sichuan. (B) Regarding science and culture: (1) The National Central Library plans to establish a Chongqing branch in Chongqing, which is currently under discussion. The Science Education Museum is being established by the Chongqing Municipal Government. (2) Equipment of scientific research institutions that moved to Sichuan that cannot be transported will be left in Sichuan as much as possible. (C) Regarding cultural industries: Whether the Scientific Instrument Manufacturing Plant and the Biological Specimen Manufacturing Plant established by the Ministry will remain in Sichuan has not yet been decided. (D) Regarding special circumstances: (1) Measures to treat foreign teachers preferentially have been drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. (2) Buildings and equipment left behind by schools and institutions that moved to Sichuan will be handed over to the Sichuan Education Department for unified distribution in the future. (3) Measures to encourage private education have been established. (4) Methods for selecting students to study abroad are being drafted. (The Ministry of Education's methods for public and private funding of overseas studies this year have recently been announced.) (An)

### Replies to Readers - Legal Questions

(1) Question from Mr. Song:

I joined the sacred War of Resistance for my motherland in the 29th year of the Republic [1940], leaving behind my family and loved one. Upon my victorious return to Shanghai, I learned that my sweetheart from years ago had been betrothed to a businessman by her family. Now that she sees I've returned safely, she confides in me her distress and denounces her fiancé as despicable (indulging in excessive drinking, gambling), and wishes to make a lifelong commitment to me. I ask, is this legally permissible? If my girlfriend's family is unhappy about the dissolution of the engagement, can the engagement still stand? My friend is 24 years old. Can she break away from her family and make her own decisions?

[Answer from lawyer Fu Kuang-lin] Since your friend is an adult, she is certainly entitled to make her own decisions regarding marriage. However, the previous engagement can only be dissolved if it meets one of the conditions listed in Article 976, Paragraph 1, of the Civil Code. While marriage cannot be forcibly compelled, those who violate an engagement without legal justification shall be liable for damages suffered by the other party as a result.

(2) Question from Zou Xiang:

Miss A and Mr. B have been married for over three years (this marriage was arranged by both sets of parents from childhood). Less than a month after the marriage, Miss A returned home. According to Miss A, she left because she was dissatisfied with Mr. B's violent temper and his frequent theft and gambling, making it difficult for them to live together. After Miss A left, she went to work elsewhere to support herself. During this period, Mr. B did not inquire about her or visit her mother's house to discuss the matter. Now, Miss A wants to divorce Mr. B and is willing to forgo recovering her dowry, but Mr. B ignores her and does not say whether he agrees to the divorce or not. I ask: (1) Is Miss A currently free? (2) Is it valid for Miss A to unilaterally declare a divorce in the newspaper? (3) Is a marriage arranged by parents from childhood valid? (4) If I marry Miss A now, am I legally guilty of a crime? (5) After I marry Miss A, can Mr. B interfere with us or sue us?

[Answer from lawyer Fu Kuang-lin] (1) While bodily freedom is protected by law, Miss A cannot marry another person before divorcing Mr. B. (2) No, it is not valid. (3) Having already been married, it is valid. (4) You cannot marry Miss A before she divorces Mr. B. You would be committing bigamy. (5) Mr. B can sue according to the law.

(3) Question from Xu Maogong:

In August of the 25th year of the Republic [1936], a relative was unable to continue his studies. At that time, a philanthropist, Zhu, offered to help with funding until the relative graduated. The philanthropist immediately paid 63 national currency units for tuition and board, saying that if he had the ability in the future, he should repay the money. Therefore, the relative and his father signed a note to Zhu, stating that they had received 63 national currency units, with no interest or other related terms. Soon after, the philanthropist Zhu declared that he could no longer continue to help due to changing circumstances. Although the relative is not yet able to repay the money, he is willing to repay it in the future and retrieve the note. However, the price of goods today is vastly different from what it was then. Should the repayment be based on a multiple of the price index, or is there another method?

[Answer from lawyer Fu Kuang-lin] According to current laws, there is no regulation requiring repayment of old debts based on a multiple of the price index. Unless there is a special agreement between the parties, the original amount can be repaid in legal tender.

### Rice Merchants Hold an Emergency Meeting - Agree on Eight Important Points - For Submission to the Municipal Government's Food Conference - Rice Prices This Morning Remain Based on Saturday

To stabilize the food supply, Mayor Wu has invited social figures, heads of relevant agencies, and leading rice merchants to a food conference at the Municipal Government this afternoon at 3:00 PM to discuss how to encourage the purchase and sale of grain and to decide on effective and specific measures to resolve the current food supply problem in a concerted effort between officials and the public, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is learned that the City Rice Dealers Association, Bean and Rice Trade, and Miscellaneous Grains Trade three guilds are cooperating with the Municipal Government to stabilize rice prices. A joint emergency meeting of all directors and supervisors was held at the Qingdage Rice Market on Sima Road yesterday (26th) morning at 9:00 AM. Directors and supervisors from all industries attended, and representatives from the Social Bureau, Ji Mingzhai and Cao Bingqian, attended to provide guidance. Xing Zhigang was elected chairman, and he reported on the recent rice market situation and the significance of this meeting. After discussion, eight key points for facilitating the rice supply and stabilizing prices were agreed upon. The chairmen of the three guilds will be delegated to attend the Municipal Government's food conference today (27th) to present the key points for discussion. The eight key points are listed below: (1) Please order the government to protect grain-carrying ships. (2) Please prioritize rice transportation by the railways. (3) Arrange for rice safety insurance. (4) Consult with banks to provide short-term, small-scale grain loans. (5) Please ensure that producing regions no longer restrict the export of rice or impose other obstacles. (6) Please have the government negotiate with grain merchants to purchase foreign rice for shipment to Shanghai. (7) Organize a rice price research group. (8) Before the Municipal Food Conference makes a resolution, market prices this morning (27th) will be stabilized and will not exceed the market price of last Saturday. Although yesterday was a holiday, the social bureau's responsible for food matters department continued to work as usual, as various rice inventory reports needed to be sorted out. Also, today afternoon is the first day of flat-price flour sales, so all preparations must be made.

Furthermore, Mr. Du Yuesheng recently told a reporter from the Huguang News Agency that the prices of goods in Shanghai have been rising wildly recently, especially rice, which is a daily necessity for citizens and should not be manipulated and hoarded by unscrupulous merchants. He believes that not only should the municipal authorities investigate, but the public should also report them so that the entire food supply can return to normal. Mr. Du concluded by saying that he sincerely hopes to help society with his personal efforts under the leadership of Mayor Wu Guozhen. It is reported that Mr. Du is also prepared to attend the food conference convened by the Municipal Government today.

### US Senate Votes to Eliminate Cotton Price Controls

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] Yesterday, the Senate Banking Committee voted to prohibit the control of raw cotton prices and to eliminate price controls in future cotton transactions.

### Foreign Rice Arriving Soon - South America Still Has Surplus Rice

[Our Report] There are many rumors about ordering foreign rice. According to reliable sources, the state-owned China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation has indeed purchased a batch from Brazil, reportedly 90,000 tons, some of which will be available on the market in the short term. Food Administration Commissioner Yang Xizhi is scheduled to return to China early next month. It is also said that he has ordered a large amount of foreign rice from the United States and South American countries. Currently, South America has the best food production situation in the world and has more surplus rice.

### Crude Oil for Soap Use Slightly Active

The crude oil market has been sluggish and inactive for more than a month. The reason is that speculation has stopped, and soap usage is not strong, so the market has been circling without changing for a long time. The clearance of supply is something unheard of in previous years, so those in this business are not interested. However, it was recently heard that the Guben Soap Factory has handled one to two thousand loads, the price being 47,000 yuan, Sima scale, delivered to the factory, equivalent to only 38,000 yuan on the city scale plus some change. However, sellers still have to lose money, so they still can't get interested. However, the inventory has moved a little, adding a little activity. Yesterday, a Hangzhou merchant arrived with 200 pieces of Neiping oil, which was distributed by each firm, priced at 46,000 yuan. However, this product is not suitable for soap making and is still only used for candles. The selling prices of each firm are 60,000 yuan for the oil that came in by train, 48,000 yuan for Neiping oil, 44,000 yuan for Dike oil, 42,000 yuan for Duzhu oil, 40,000 yuan for Lan oil, and 38,000 yuan for Macheng oil.

### Shortages and Export Restrictions Cause Decline in British Tinplate

[Reuters, Cardiff, 26th] Tinplate industry insiders admit that if the tinplate export industry does not modernize, it may permanently lose the market. Although exports of other steel products are booming, tinplate is declining due to shortages and export restrictions. Before the war, tinplate was the most valuable of British steel products, accounting for 20% of the total. However, exports were greatly reduced during the war, and production fell to 11 million boxes per year.

### The Process of Change in the Selling of Woolen Cloth to Visiting Merchants

— Maofang

Shanghai is a gathering place for Chinese and foreign merchants, and buyers from all over the country gather here to purchase goods. The changing situation of woollen cloth sales to visiting merchants is briefly described as follows. The first places to purchase woollen cloth from Shanghai were South China and North China. Shops were opened in Shanghai, such as Yishunheng, Yishunsheng, Yongfengli, and Shiyitang. The Guandong merchants were attached to them. The Guangdong-South, Chaoshan, and Xiamen merchants mostly stayed in the Guangdong fruit shops on Tiantong Road in Hongkou, and later gradually rented houses. Next came the Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Hunan, and Jiangxi merchants, such as Dachuantong, Taiguyu, Yiheyu, Zhaoshangyu, Xiejixing, Huijixing, Yijizhan, Xiangyugong (Xingchanglong, Huyigong, Changsha Commercial Guild, etc.). Other merchants, such as those from Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, Hankou, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Jinan, Xi'an, Dalian, and Jiangxi, mostly came to Shanghai twice a year to purchase goods, buying summer goods in the spring and winter goods in the autumn. They either attached themselves to the shops of acquaintances in the same industry or rented houses in the alleyways, such as Taipingfang, Weishuifang, Juyuanfang, Jingheli, and Taozhuli.

After 1925, the South China merchants needed to purchase less because the prices in Hong Kong were cheaper, so they all changed locations to purchase nearby. At the same time, the Dalian merchants all handled transit goods, because they could collect the same customs duties, so they needed the original delivery notes. Later, because merchants cheated, the government cancelled the tax refund, and the Shanghai shops of that group closed down one after another, while the Chongqing-Chengdu and Tianjin-Beijing Yangtze River merchants greatly increased their purchases. After the government established its capital in Nanjing, the small merchants from Nanjing, Suzhou, Bengbu, Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Jinhua, and Ningbo suddenly strengthened their purchases of woollen cloth, especially those from Nanjing. At the same time, the purchases of the merchants from Guandong and Xingbei suddenly decreased, because many foreign firms in Shanghai had branches in Tianjin, and that group all ordered and sold goods nearby. The purchases of the large and small Sichuan merchants and the Jiangxi merchants increased. After the January 28th Incident in 1932, the sales to visiting merchants changed again. The merchants from the Northeast were hit hard, and they closed their Shanghai shops one after another and left Shanghai. Fortunately, the sales to merchants in the interior increased, and the total sales of woollen cloth were still able to increase without decreasing. After the full-scale War of Resistance began on August 13, 1937, land and water transportation gradually became difficult and then stopped. All the merchants were oppressed by the enemy and puppets, and they all closed down one after another. Many merchant guilds closed and reorganized. During the years of enemy-puppet occupation, except for the three cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, there were no other merchants purchasing goods, but the sales of single merchants and Japanese firms increased sharply. Since the victory of the War of Resistance in August of last year, the demand from merchants in various places has gradually increased again. The Chongqing-Chengdu merchants were the first to vigorously purchase, followed by the Tianjin-Beijing and Changsha-Nanjing merchants. In recent times, all have been in the process of recovery. It is expected that starting next spring, when land and water transportation is convenient, woollen cloth sales to visiting merchants will be completely new.

### The Current Clothing Problem - Raw Materials and Labor Urgently Need Adjustment - Many Looms are Still Idle

[Our Report] Recently, the market price of yarn and cloth has been rising sharply. When the Textile Building Company lists its prices, the number of people asking to open goods is redoubled, and the company prioritizes military supplies, so the approval of goods for opening have been reduced, causing even fewer supplies for private cloth mills and even higher prices. Actually, the number of outside customers is still the same as usual. And, even in the view of the Textile Building, on the 23rd, was opening goods of 60,000+ bolts of cloth, on the 24th, it was 800+ bundles of yarn, on the 25th, it was 55,000 bolts of cloth, the number is still considerable. It seems that the recent price increases have other stimuli besides actual sales. According to textile, dyeing, and cotton cloth businessman, Mr. Pan Shihao, to solve this problem, we should first

Promote Production Capacity: The Textile Building is now the authority in the yarn and cloth industry. Its production capacity can be estimated as follows:

[The section detailing the Textile Building's production capacity is missing, but it indicates that only half of the capacity is being utilized.]

It can be seen that the Textile Building's production capacity is currently only operating at half capacity and is on a single-shift system. Therefore, there is still much room for promotion in the future. If a portion of it can be leased to private manufacturers to allow official-private cooperation to alleviate the clothing problem, it would be more appropriate. Second, we should

Adjust the Supply of Raw Materials: It is very distressing that there is a shortage of national cotton and we rely on American cotton. And America is going to reduce supply due to decreased cotton production this year, which should inspire our people to understand the situation. Under today's circumstances, the products must be designed to be civilian so that the limited raw materials can be used as much as possible for daily necessities, which is in line with economic principles. Therefore, the production of fine-count yarn and high-end cloth may be reduced. The national cotton can be used more. About 2 million bales of American cotton have been ordered and have not yet arrived, and some have arrived but have not been used. I have calculated with colleagues that, based on the current opening rate, private and state-owned industries can support the market for about three months. Private enterprises have about 2 million yarns, but only half of them are open. Unfortunately, cotton-producing areas such as North China and the Salt Reclamation Area cannot connect with production capacity due to order and traffic relations. Private manufacturers should find ways to purchase in the producing areas, so hundreds of thousands can be collected. During this period, when it is still far from the new flower being in the market, we must pay attention to adjusting the supply of national cotton raw materials. The last is that we should

Adjust Labor Relations: If the measures taken by both parties are disciplined, it will greatly increase the promotion of production capacity. Currently, private manufacturers and yarn mills claim to have high profits, but they are not as good as before. The environment for cloth mills and dyeing and weaving mills is even worse. Unless labor and management understand each other, the future will be disastrous. Also, in order to restore vitality,

Re-issuing Confiscated Yarn and Cloth: should no longer be delayed. Yarn and cloth mills are very eager for this problem. About 2 million pieces were transferred from the puppet Business Association to our government. If it can be returned immediately, it can directly save the fate of the victimized factories and directly suppress the yarn and cloth market.

### Unrestricted Speculative Funds Cause Heavy Industry Fluctuations Over the Past Week - Finance and Goods See the Most Drastic Changes - Rice Prices Are High, Creating a Stalemate

The fluctuations of financial and goods were drastic last week. Since speculative funds have not yet been directed towards normal channels, gold, securities, banknotes still have abnormal trends. However, the Bank of China's measures to curb gold have been quite effective. The black market is in a dilemma. Although speculators are thinking of making a move, it is difficult to succeed. As for goods, the rice problem is still the most serious. Although it fell slightly for a few days at the beginning of the week, it then rose again, finally becoming a stalemate. If there is no fundamental solution, it will not be easy to break through the difficulty. Here is a summary of the developments of each industry over the past week:

Gold: The trend last week had the greatest fluctuations on Monday. Amid the buying pressure of speculators, it once broke through the 2 million mark. Later, because the Bank of China made open and secret sales, and credit was tight, secret interest rates were as high as two jiao outside, and people's hearts were weak, and there were frequent releases, and the market immediately declined to 1.91 million. The weakness continued on Tuesday, and then it stabilized. On Wednesday, securities and other items were bought on the cheap, and the closing price was 1.96 million yuan. On Thursday, it dropped below 1.9 million yuan. The situation changed on Friday and Saturday because the stock market attracted attention, and speculators had sales activities. In two days, it fell from about 1.9 million yuan to 1.84 million yuan, which was the closing price for the weekend.

Foreign Currency: The exchange rate for US telegraphic transfers this week was 2,020 yuan. The Central Bank's supply price has not changed. The US dollar fluctuates with the gold market. At the beginning of the week, it rose rapidly from 2,420 yuan to 2,520 yuan, which was the highest price of the week. From Tuesday to Friday, it hovered around 2,400 yuan. The lowest was 2,235 yuan on Saturday. The weekend closing price was 2,335 yuan, a decrease of 55 yuan from the end of last week.

Government Bonds: In the black market for the C bonds this week, selling pressure was heavy. 6650 dropped to near 6000, Tuesday continued decline, buying was stronger from Wednesday to Thursday. On Friday, the situation gradually revealed a glimmer of dawn, and people's hearts were prospering. The closing price on Saturday was 7,850 yuan, the highest price of the week, an increase of 1,200 yuan from the end of last week.

Chinese Stocks: It was still stable at the beginning of the week, but because the price of gold rose sharply, frequent sales resulted, and the market went downstream step by step. The price of each of the yarn mills and Maya fell to within 54,000, which was a drop of 400 yuan. The three small stocks fell less. On Tuesday, the market rebounded because large investors raised prices and small investors were very interested in buying. As a result, the rise of large stocks was small, and the three small stocks rose by more than 10%. On Wednesday, it was quite active at the beginning, and the yarn mills and Maya both rose to outside the 54,000 mark. Later, because floating profits were sold out, it turned into a stalemate. Near noon, they were all squeezed up. On Thursday, the yarn mills, Maya, and Xinguang all showed good results, but Jingfu was put under pressure by speculators again, and he reported that he was lagging behind with Qinxing. On Friday, except for the slight setback of Xinguang, popular stocks all had a squeezed up price, especially yarn mills. On Saturday, the yarn mills were doing well, and Maya was also raised. The three small stocks were very little bit better.

Foreign Stocks: On Monday, because Chinese stocks fell and selling pressure rose, everything was weak. On Tuesday, the weakness eased slightly. On Wednesday, Yisha initially opened as high as 12,500 yuan, and then entered a stalemate, finally leveling with yesterday. The small stocks continued to be popular, and Huide also rebounded. On Thursday, with the easing of credit, more parties became active. Yisha once shouted as high as 13,500 yuan, and the closing price was prosperous across the board. On Friday, Yisha once rose to 13,700 yuan, and then the floating profit was sold out. On Saturday, it rose first and then fatigued. The result was a squeeze up in all prices.

Rice and Grain: At the beginning of the week, the rice market was weak due to rumors that the authorities were inspecting warehouses and that the authorities were setting a deadline for registering grain in storage. On Thursday, retail sales of rice increased sharply, and sales to domestic areas were strong. The price then rebounded, and flour also prospered. The market was mediocre on Friday. On Saturday, the asking price for rice was high again, and there were few transactions. Except for the flour in the naval fleet, which fell by 2,000 yuan, the remaining flour prospered by several hundred yuan. Miscellaneous grains were stable, cooking oil was slightly weak, and sugar was strong and stable.

Spot Yarn: In the past week, primarily because gold and the US dollar rose in unison, the spot yarn actual sales by the Tianjin, Guangdong, and other domestic main customer groups were strong. The 42-count and 32-count double-strand fine yarn are still held by the Textile Building, so the market supply is dry, and buying is very strong. On Tuesday, the 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn once created an unprecedented high of 2.65 million. The 20-count Double Horse also reached a high price of 1.4 million. Subsequently, as the yarn of each continues to Zhang Zhi Dengfeng's pole, the factory and the many profits are abundant, and they tend to turn high and sell. On Tuesday, the price jumped by as much as 200,000 yuan in half a day. After Wednesday, it was calm. The highest of the whole week was 2.65 million for the 42-count Blue Phoenix on Wednesday, and the lowest was 860,000 for the 10-count. The difference between the high and low was 1.79 million. In terms of the number of counts, the rise of the 32-count Xiantao double-strand was still more Sheng Shi. It still rose by 200,000 from the previous week. The rise of the remaining yarns was gentle, all less than 100,000 yuan.

Cloth Market: Although the market was flooded with foreign goods this week, factory costs were high due to the high price of yarn, and they were unwilling to depreciate and make concessions. Moreover, the use of military uniforms, children's clothing, and umbrellas has recently been quite extensive. The weekend was the most promising. The price of each item was 2-3,000 higher than the previous week, and the price of Daming gray light diagonal cloth increased by 6,000 yuan.

Cotton Market: The demand from factories and cotton merchants this week was quite good. The Textile Building handled 3,000 bales. In addition, private factories such as Shenxin 167 and Jiafeng Sulun Dasheng Fu'an Xinsheng Dacheng also had considerable transactions. At the weekend, the high-grade mitering reached as high as 105,000, each up 5-6,000 from the previous week.

Silk: Compared with Monday, the user factory's silk and silk products were about 50,000 yuan shorter this week, and merchants from Suzhou and Hangzhou made purchases. The Ocean Bank's transaction for 78 minutes was 2.3 million yuan and 2.4 million yuan, 81 points for 2.375 million yuan, and 83 points for 2.6 million yuan. The smallest price for 120-size artificial silk Daqiao was 1.42 million yuan on Monday, the largest price was 1.5 million yuan on Friday, and the price on Saturday was 1.478 million yuan, a increase of 50,000 yuan compared with the big one on Monday. The 75th-size Yuji semi-light price was 1.54 million yuan on Monday, and the price on Saturday was 1.5 million yuan, a small amount of 40,000 yuan. The price of Zhongfang Company's goods on the fourth day of last week was 20,000 yuan higher than the sixth day of the previous week, so the market price of 120 size also increased. The market price of silk goods was weak and powerless, and the market price of lattice crepe, which is now the season's goods, was still short 245,000 yuan last week. The beauty was also short 230,000 yuan.

Hardware: The price of the five metals this week was low, and there were no actual sales, so the market price was weak and not strong. The same was true for small metal items. However, because the supply and demand of green yarn were not in line, the market price rose sharply to 200,000 yuan. The door lock had some sales to customers. For example, dog tag V door locks were selling for 80,000 yuan per dozen, but the factory was still finding it difficult to bear the cost.

### American Gold Arrives in China in Batches

[Reuters, London, 26th] It is learned here that an American cargo ship has sailed from New York to Shanghai, carrying a batch of gold worth approximately $14 million. Another cargo ship is currently loading in New York and is expected to carry the same amount of gold to China. It is believed that this is the last of five batches of gold to be shipped to China, with the total value of the five batches being approximately $70 million.

### Inside Story of the Sou-Mac Scheme: Soviet Union Eagerly Seeks US Dollars

[Reuters, London, 26th] A Chicago Tribune reporter claims that usually reliable sources have revealed that the Soviet Union has supplied France with 500,000 tons of wheat, receiving in return a huge sum of US$33,000,000. The details of the Soviet-French wheat deal are being kept strictly secret, because the Soviet Union's shipment of wheat to France is intended as a political maneuver to win favor. France currently needs US dollars for reconstruction. Announcing the details would arouse public resentment. French President Gouin and Finance Minister Philip are of course aware of the details, but out of concern, they are also keeping silent.

The Soviet Union is extremely eager for US dollars, for the following three reasons: (1) The US dollar is a powerful tool in international power politics. (2) The Soviet Union also needs to purchase American machinery with US dollars to carry out domestic reconstruction. (3) Controlling the foreign exchange of neighboring countries, such as Poland and the Balkan states, can make it easier for these countries to submit. Therefore, the Soviet Union has been able to control the use of loans granted by the US Export-Import Bank to countries within the red sphere.

The United Nations General Assembly previously pointed out that the Soviet Union refused to cooperate in famine relief, and the ultimate goal was to use its surplus grain as an economic weapon to easily obtain the British pounds and US dollars of smaller countries. The Soviet Union's obstruction of the rapid establishment of peace treaties will cause the private enterprises of small countries to be on the verge of bankruptcy, or fall into the hands of the government.

### Cocoon Loans: 7 Billion Already Released to 50 Companies

This year’s spring cocoon loans for the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui were processed by the management committee of a banking syndicate, which began approving and releasing them last month. Currently, there are 57 silk cocoon manufacturers applying for loans. Last week, loan agreements were signed with 50 companies, and 7 billion yuan has already been loaned out. According to the person in charge of the committee, this loan process will continue next week, and the first batch of spring cocoons purchased will be shipped to Shanghai by the beginning of next month at the latest.

### Insurance Companies

Must Obtain Licenses from Both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs

[Our Newspaper Report] According to the current Insurance Industry Management Law, any establishment of an insurance company must first be approved and licensed by the Ministry of Finance, and then registered and licensed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in accordance with the Company Law. Only after completing these two procedures can business be conducted. It is heard that some companies in this city have only obtained a license from either the Ministry of Finance or the Ministry of Economic Affairs and must complete the procedures in the short term. It is heard that the central government has already taken notice of this.

### US Dollar Devaluation in France: Outcome of Franco-American Loan

[Reuters, Paris, 26th] The news of the Franco-American loan has caused the value of the US dollar in the black market to gradually decline, shrinking by an average of one French franc per hour. Those holding US dollars are rushing to the black market on the streets of Paris, hoping to sell them off before the weekend. In the past twelve hours, the value of the US dollar has dropped by twenty French francs. The British pound is also weakening along with it. Black market traders near the Opera Garnier have found that no one is interested in their US dollars. A black market trader said, "Last week, we could earn seven to ten French francs for every dollar we traded, but now we only earn five French francs. If this continues, we may have to change careers."

### Economic Briefs

The work of the National Supreme Economic Council will be actively launched, and the Shanghai office is expected to be established within a week. The office will be located within the Central Bank. The work of this office is to supervise the financial and economic circles of this city, develop resources, and increase production to suppress commodity prices.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 26th] The Indian government, in view of the serious domestic food shortage, stopped the export of peanuts from February of this year. Recently, it issued another order, completely prohibiting the export of peanuts.

### Twenty-Nine Days in Changchun (9)

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Shao Shenzhi

Two Instances of "Freedom"

One person suggested going out, and everyone readily agreed. No one wanted to give up this right, except for the sensible Wheeler. He preferred to stay at home, saying, "I'll watch the house and deal with any unexpected events." We agreed with his alertness and promised to return within half an hour.

We walked along Chaoyang Road, heading towards the Xiehe Guild Hall, which had once been used as the headquarters by the Soviet army, and then towards Datong Square. As we approached the barbed wire fence at the square's entrance, we saw hundreds and thousands of poorly dressed civilians pouring out from a building behind the Police Headquarters, as if being driven out for their lives. The surge was fierce, like a tidal wave. We had to carefully protect our fleeting "freedom," so we stood our ground, not daring to go against the tide.

The tide of people grew stronger and stronger. We couldn't allow ourselves to be swallowed up by the tide in vain, so we retreated to our residence. We closed the door tightly, sat inside, and quietly listened to our own breathing.

After a while, Wang Sanye came upstairs. Wang Sanye was the respected chef of Commander Wu Ziyu. Without saying a word, he first held out his left hand, making a "V" shape with two fingers, waving it continuously in front of us, and said in a low voice, "They've retreated, the New First Army has entered!" He said it very proudly, as if to say that we reporters, the "know-it-alls," didn't have news as quickly as he did. We didn't reply to him, and he solemnly tried to gain our trust, saying, "I, Wang San, have my ways of gathering information in Changchun." (Note: "Running errands" means "detective" in the northern dialect.)

Before Section Chief Bai Juren arrived, "soldiers" came to our door again to protect our "safety." This time there were sixteen of them, plus a political instructor.

We really didn't understand what game was being played this morning. We thought that maybe it was a troop relocation. Sanye himself knew that he had blundered when he bragged about the big cannon firing. When serving lunch, he lowered his head to an extreme degree, not even looking us in the eye. We couldn't help but find it funny. When the second course was served, Sanye hid in the kitchen and disappeared.

This was our first "freedom," a "freedom" we had stolen for ourselves.

After this, we appealed to Zhou Baozhong for democracy. After sending out the protest letter on the 21st, we constantly yearned for the grand order of "granting freedom." But the days spent cooped up in the house were longer than those spent outside. This prolonged sorrowful confinement was truly unbearable. We waited until the evening of the 21st without any response, and again on the 22nd. The entire day of the 23rd was spent languishing in the fiery hell of disappointment!

On the 24th, we no longer had any hope of freedom of movement. The kitchen of Lü's mansion sent us a note from Zhao Junmai, which read, "This morning, the Communist army searched my residence thoroughly, stripping everyone of their clothes. I fear it will be inconvenient for me to visit you in the future. Please take good care of the five American reporters. They are friends of China, and Changchun today is still ultimately Chinese land. Yours truly, Mai." We knew that he was no longer free either. Just when we had given up on the hope of freedom, a friend surnamed Chen suddenly arrived, seemingly a political worker. He brought four comrades, all carrying long guns.

He said, "Today, I am ordered by Commander Zhou to accompany you gentlemen to take a stroll in the city." He also had a letter from Commander Zhou. The letter read: "To Mr. Zhao, forwarded to the American reporters: Today you may take a stroll in the city. Although the weather is very good, I do not have the time to accompany you. I ask that you follow the advice of the guards regarding security. You had originally invited me to dine with you today, but I request that the time be determined after I notify you. With best regards, Zhou Baozhong, April 24th." We all went out at that time. Wheeler was lying in bed due to illness. This was our second instance of freedom of movement, granted to us by Zhou Baozhong.

We still took Chaoyang Road, passing Datong Square, then entering the city market via Datong Street. As we walked down the street, there were two soldiers in front and two soldiers behind us. The Japanese, swaggering and carefree, saw several Americans mixed with a few Chinese being escorted down the street by the Communist army. They were surprised, perhaps thinking, "Who are these bad guys?" or "What on earth is going on?"

Beckett was the first to feel a little embarrassed. He whispered to Shixun, "This really feels like being prisoners, it's terrible!"

We wandered aimlessly through the open-air market. After a while, Mattison from the Associated Press disappeared. Mr. Chen was extremely anxious and sent people everywhere to look for him. We were so disturbed by him that we simply retreated back to our makeshift prison, where we felt more comfortable. We all walked back to our residence together.

A while later, Mattison was found. He was running far behind us, followed by a soldier.

Soon after we were sitting in the lounge, Mattison and Mr. Chen suddenly started arguing. We knew that some trouble must have broken out again. Sure enough, Mr. Chen was holding two cameras, one Wheeler's "Leica" and the other Mattison's "Zeiss Ikon."

"I only took a picture of the fire behind the Xiehe Guild Hall, and I even got permission from that soldier," Mattison said, wiping the sweat from his forehead. We certainly knew about the fire at the Xiehe Guild Hall, but we had become accustomed to the flames of civil war in the past few days.

"These two cameras must be sent to Commander Zhou for verification, and perhaps they will be returned to you afterward, but one cannot say for sure." Mr. Chen meant "investigation," but he said "verification." After saying this, he took the cameras and left, without even writing a receipt, almost driving Mattison crazy.

In the afternoon, Mattison drafted a letter to Zhou Baozhong in the name of himself and Wheeler. The translation is as follows: "General Zhou Baozhong:

This morning, Mattison and several other reporters went out for a stroll under the protection of people you sent. Mattison brought his own "Zeiss Ikon," and Wheeler of the Chicago Daily News, who is sick in bed, also handed his "Leica" to Mattison, hoping he would take a photo for him.

Mattison only took a picture of the fire at the Xiehe Guild Hall, which he had already obtained permission from the guard to do. He took no other photos. Mr. Chen insisted on taking both cameras back this morning, saying he would hand them over to you. He did not give us a receipt when he took them.

Cameras are the tools of our trade as reporters. We hope you will return them to us. You are welcome to inspect the film. We thank you for your cooperation. We wish you good health! Wheeler and Mattison, April 24th."

On the morning of the 25th, there was still no response, and Mattison and Wheeler both believed that the cameras had been confiscated. After a while, Zhao Junmai came to see us with Peng Jiaren, Zhou Baozhong's secretary-general. At that time, we learned that Zhao Junmai, Lai Bingquan, Zhang Datong, Captain Cao, and Wu Shiyi had been moved to the Asia Hotel on Datong Street near the railway station after being searched yesterday. Zhao said, "The food is very good, even better than yours, and we are being treated very well." We were finally relieved.

Wheeler's first concern upon seeing Peng Jiaren was to get back his camera. He said, "Cameras and typewriters are the only tools of our profession. One cannot be without the other. I hope you can find a way to return them to us."

Peng Jiaren agreed to try, but did not confirm that they would be returned.

That same afternoon, Zhou Baozhong sent another letter, which read:

"To Mr. Zhao Shixun (Note: Zhou always mistakenly wrote "Xun" instead of "Xun" in his letters to Shixun), forwarded to the reporter gentlemen. I personally support your going out for interviews and sightseeing, and our superiors have also instructed us to provide you gentlemen with as much convenience as possible. In recent days, although the order and security of Changchun have improved daily, the secret agent elements secretly undermining actions have been discovered several times. Baozhong is truly responsible for the safety of your actions, so I dare not be negligent in providing guards. Please understand. If you gentlemen wish to go out today, I have already informed the guards to accompany you. However, please do not take any more photos, as Changchun is still under martial law. Furthermore, I plan to visit you gentlemen this evening for advice. Please let me know a suitable time. Wishing you good health, Zhou Baozhong, April 25th."

Wheeler and Mattison still hadn't heard any news about the return of their cameras. Dispirited, they collapsed onto their beds, their faces turning purple with anger.

When we invited Zhou Baozhong to dinner that evening, he promised to send them back the next day, saying that the film was completely untouched. Wheeler and Mattison were naturally happy, but they still hadn't been sent the next day. We deeply felt that they often did not keep their word, perhaps because they regarded us as "prisoners" and did not respect us. On the morning of the 29th, when Major Rick, the military attaché, was preparing to return to Shenyang, Zhou Baozhong came to our residence to pick him up and see him off at the airport. At that time, we mentioned the matter of the cameras to Zhou Baozhong again, and he said he would return them before you left.

This was the only unfortunate event in our second instance of "freedom."

Secret Radio Station

Our life in confinement within the Special Commissioner's Office was just as Beckett, a reporter for the United Press, described in a Central News Agency telegram from Beiping on the 10th: it was divided into three stages. In the first stage, we were regarded as spies; in the second stage, we were seen as political prisoners; and in the third stage, that is, after May 1st, when the Northeast Bureau moved from Jilin to Changchun, and the Propaganda Minister of the Bureau, Kai Feng, had spoken with us (Kai was formerly the editor of the Liberation Daily), the style changed drastically, and we were treated as honored guests.

This section about the "secret radio station" happened during the first stage when we were regarded as spies. We were constantly interrogated by the political instructors of the Communist army, once or twice, and we were truly exhausted from dealing with it!

It was around 5:00 p.m. on the 20th when several American colleagues were playing ball in the garden. Shixun had just woken up from his afternoon nap and was walking out of his room, wanting to join in their game. Unexpectedly, at that moment, a Communist soldier suddenly arrived. His first words were, "Who is Mr. Zhao Shixun?" He was looking at the list of reporters we had written for Sun Zheng, the political commissar of the brigade, on the evening of the 18th.

Shixun unhesitatingly said, "I am. May I ask your name and what you would like to discuss?"

"My name is Chen Han, and I'm here to talk to you," Chen said, walking towards the study opposite Shixun's bedroom. Shixun followed Chen into the study, and Shenzhi also ran in to help answer questions.

Chen Han was very young, probably around twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old. He said that he had studied at Nankai Middle School in Tianjin and later studied civil engineering at Shandong University in Qingdao, so he said that he also understood English. He told us that when he was at Shandong University, he had studied English with Professor Hong Shen. However, he then turned the topic to Shixun, saying, "Mr. Zhao, you are quite chubby, a bit like Hong Shen." I asked him, "Really? Hong Shen is my friend, but I don't think so myself." Chen Han didn't say anything, his eyes staring straight at the ceiling, blowing smoke rings randomly from his mouth. We all sat quietly to one side, not moving at all. He had come to have a lighthearted chat with me while we were living a life akin to being in prison. It was too disharmonious and very unsettling. The room was extremely quiet, and no one could think of anything to say. We also randomly blew smoke, and this stalemate lasted for three minutes.

Suddenly, he asked us seriously, "Do you have a radio station here?" We were stunned at that moment, not knowing what he was asking about.

"What radio station?" Guanzhi asked him.

"The radio station you use to send news. Actually, it doesn't matter if you do or not, we're just talking," Chen Han said, relaxing again.

"We don't have a radio station, and we haven't sent any news. You can search right now if you don't believe us," Shixun said to him very frankly.

At that time, Chen Han became cunning. He said that he had already obtained our telegram drafts. He said that we had sent news that was unfavorable to the Soviet Union and unfavorable to the Chinese Communist Party. He even said that if we didn't believe him, he could show us the telegram drafts immediately.

Our blood was boiling. We reported based on facts and spoke with conscience. We had never done anything to deceive our readers. But at that time, there was no time to argue with him about this point. Shixun resolutely replied to him:

"Then please show us the telegram drafts. We think that they are not as you describe them." At that time, his tone softened again, and he said that he was just asking and that it was not a big deal at all.

He walked out of the room and asked where we lived. We pointed to the small room opposite the study. Without our permission, he arrogantly forced the door open and inspected it. We really didn't know what his intention was.

It was time for us to eat dinner. Wheeler and the others walked into the room and asked what Mr. Chen was doing there. Mr. Chen didn't understand and needed someone to translate for him. He then said, "It's nothing, I just came to see how you are living."

Wheeler said, "Good, then I can tell you that our life is that of prisoners." After saying this, he ran away.

Chen Han became very angry and warned us, "This kind of attitude will be disadvantageous to this gentleman in the future. What is his name?" He took out the list to look. The expression on his face was terribly fierce.

We ate our dinner and invited him to have a simple meal, but he said he had already eaten. He still sat down to talk to us, pointing at Beckett with his chopsticks and asking, "Is this gentleman an American soldier?" Beckett put down his chopsticks, turned his shoulder, and showed him the "War Correspondent" insignia.

The second person to investigate the secret radio station was Bai Juren, the liaison section chief from Liu Qiren's office. He came to see us on the morning of the 21st. At that time, he claimed to be a small clerk, and we honestly believed what he said. But that afternoon, when Shixun accompanied Major Rick, the military attaché, to see Zhou Baozhong to negotiate about airplanes and gasoline, Zhou Baozhong immediately called him "Section Chief Bai." I really don't know what the purpose of this Mr. Bai's lie was.

The center of his conversation with us was still inseparable from the secret radio station, and we answered him in the same way we had answered Chen Han. He also asked if the Americans had a radio station, and we also said no. We also asked Bai Juren to search in the same way we had asked Chen Han, and Bai Juren also said that it wasn't necessary.

When he walked out of the room, he constantly paid attention to the crisscrossing wires in the yard, seemingly trying to distinguish which wire was used for the "secret" radio station. He firmly did not believe our explanation, and said, "It is impossible that you don't have a radio station. One..."

We ourselves also began to feel a little strange. We discussed the origin of this secret radio station, and it was really a bit of a mystery.

Our American colleagues all liked to write their manuscripts late at night using typewriters. With five typewriters operating at the same time, the sound would naturally arouse the vigilance of our "protectors." Listening to the sound from afar, it really did sound a bit like wireless telegraphy.

We began to laugh, the more we thought about it, the more we laughed, and the more we felt that the problem was becoming complex.

Sure enough, on the afternoon of the 27th, a political instructor surnamed Ma from the battalion came. He spoke more deeply and also mentioned the secret radio station. He began very directly by saying that there was the sound of telegraphing in our house at night. We understood that this must have been the trouble caused by the typewriters. Shixun then went upstairs and took down the typewriter, personally demonstrating it for him to see. He still didn't understand, and he had never seen a typewriter before. After talking for a long time, he left in a state of half-belief and half-doubt.

After walking out of the room, he also inspected the wires in the yard as usual.

This vague "secret radio station" had been investigated three times, which clearly showed that it was under orders from superiors.

A scene from Shirley Temple's new film "Kiss and Tell." This film is Temple's first new film after the victory and will soon be released in Shanghai.

Three Communist Soldiers

Our life was really extremely boring. Lippmann found a violin and a small accordion from somewhere. No one could play the accordion, but Lippmann played the violin quite well. After eating, everyone would sit together and drink tea, and he would hold his violin and ask, "What do you want to hear?"

Shenzhi found a phonograph, but it was broken. After using all his ingenuity to repair it, he played it every day, always the same few records, until everyone was sick of it.

Because Wheeler was feeling unwell, he asked for a doctor to come. This matter was also discussed and approved in advance with the protectors at the door, so a Chinese doctor was invited. Then, several Swiss people came. They wore the Swiss flag with a red and white cross, and the protectors thought they were like the Red Cross, simply taking them for nurses and doctors, and letting them in. They were two brothers and three sisters, who had previously made a living in a circus. Last year, they came to Changchun via Argentina and Moscow to perform, and now they were having a hard time making a living. The youngest of the girls, named Ingeborg, had been gang-raped after August 15th. When she told this story, her face turned green and her lips trembled. As soon as they saw the American flag, they came to visit. As soon as they came, they wanted to chat, talk about everything, dance, and drink tea, taking up a lot of time, and then they would rudely stay for dinner. The dinner itself wasn't much, but the head cook only bought a fixed amount of vegetables every day, and it was difficult for the head cook to manage. Buying vegetables required going to a very faraway place, and it was difficult to replenish them at short notice. They often arrived at the time of dinner, and we naturally invited them to sit down together. Later, we found it difficult to deal with, and once we had to take turns closing the door and eating. We were a group, and while we welcomed them, we didn't want them to come and disrupt our lives.

The head cook often said, "Things are expensive and difficult to buy." Only then did we realize the weight of these words.

The Communist soldiers at the door realized that something was wrong during their second visit. These Swiss friends would play in the house for an entire day. On the 27th, they came, and they left, saying that they were seeing a doctor for a whole day. We told him that they were Swiss people, not doctors. This made him stunned, but he said, "Swiss people are even worse, we can't be responsible."

"Are we not allowed to see guests?"

"We are ordered not to allow anyone to enter the house."

They left. But they came again the next day, bringing a phonograph, which caused more trouble. We negotiated with the protectors. Since they were not allowed to enter the house, then since they had come, they would have to spend some time in the garden. Lippmann drafted a letter, signed by the American and Chinese reporters, and sent it to Liu Qiren, informing him of what had happened here, asking him if it was for our "safety" that we couldn't go out, and even our guests were not allowed to come? We asked him to allow us to have normal social interactions. We asked him to reply. The letter was given to the protectors, but it was returned with the original letter, saying that they couldn't find him.

At this time, the phonograph that the Swiss had brought was turned on in the garden, and they were dancing on the balcony. Since they had gained a foothold, they adopted a policy of taking an inch after getting a foot. We still invited them into the house, and the protectors still muttered, saying that they couldn't be responsible, but it seemed that it could be handled flexibly. So we agreed that they could go back earlier, so as not to make these soldiers feel embarrassed.

These Swiss people continued to come, and every time they came, we had to negotiate with the guns at the door once. This time, they dragged a small cart of props, and we explained that they were here to perform magic tricks, and we would invite the Eighth Route Army to come and watch later. This time, they performed two programs, one was a duet dance, and the other was a technical performance. It was like the footwork in a Chinese circus. The two girls pointed their feet to the sky, each rotating a cardboard cylinder, and then they switched to two Chinese umbrellas. The technique was very ordinary, but it won praise, because we really had nothing else to watch.

On the 30th, it rained, and two Communist soldiers "borrowed" our phonograph, promising to return it in the evening. But it was not returned in the evening. (Later, after Zhou Baozhong's secretary investigated, it was only returned on the 5th). At noon, the Swiss friends came again. This time, the whole family of eight came together, including the five siblings, their parents, and a child. But we didn't have enough food today. We only made a pot of soup for them to eat.

While we were sitting and chatting in the reception room, three Communist soldiers suddenly came in from the rain, straight into our house, wanting to borrow the Swiss friends' phonograph. Shenzhi told them that someone had already come to borrow it.

"Those were other people, we don't know about them. Who are you?"

We told them that we were reporters.

"That won't do. We are serving the people. You must lend it to us even if you don't want to." Then, seeing that we had the intention of refusing, they pointed their fingers and glared, scolding us in an extremely vulgar and barbaric manner that we had never seen before. These people were not the ones guarding the door. In comparison, the guards were really too polite.

Then they started to handle guns, and the other two went to the back to move wooden boards. At this time, Beckett put the phonograph in the reception room and pulled the door shut. This fat man stood at the door, blocking the way, and said:

"This phonograph belongs to our guests. We cannot lend it out. We can lend our own. Besides, you have already borrowed it."

### A Journey to Jiangdu

— Shi Yiming

The situation in Northern Jiangsu appears relaxed on the surface, but is tense underneath. It is said that Yangzhou has already been surrounded by the troops of Commander Yun, and without permission, ships are not allowed to dock and people are not allowed to enter the city. On the north bank of the Yangtze River, this last remaining famous city, should it undergo any changes, then Northern Jiangsu will form another new landscape. How can the thousands of people displaced and living in exile not suddenly feel worried?

Last month, I, as a reporter, took a trip to Yangzhou, spending five days in total for the round trip. Although it was just a fleeting glance, what I heard and saw was deeply impactful. Now, as the nation's attention is focused on this perilous corner of the ancient canal of grain transport, I wish to write this article for those who are concerned, as a reference.

Yangzhou fell into enemy hands in the winter of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937]. In the past eight years, the area that has suffered the most and been the most cruelly abused has been the rural areas, especially the northwest. This is still the case even after the victory. According to my investigation, the situation unfolded as follows:

After the fall of Yangzhou, a portion of the Nationalist army retreated to the Huangjue Bridge and Gongdao Bridge area in the northwest countryside. The army's supplies and provisions were all taken from the villagers. Residents of the urban area, fearing slaughter by the enemy, all fled with their elders and children to the rural areas. Unable to vent their desires, the enemy had traitors like Wu Xiaohou and Fang Xiaoting flatter them, saying, "All the beauties of Jiangdu are in the countryside." Consequently, these two traitors, Wu and Fang, led the Japanese troops of Taniguchi to frequently descend upon the countryside to rape and pillage, which further incited the villagers' resistance. They rose up in large numbers and spontaneously formed groups such as the "Jiangdu County Anti-Japanese Detachment," "People's Bandit Suppression Corps," "Traitor Elimination Group," "Special Operations Team," and "Guerrilla Force." Among these, planned actions included sending people into the city to assassinate the traitor Wu Xiaohou and ambushing the enemy soldiers at Longweitian. Unfortunately, Wu was not killed in the assassination attempt. Enraged, he incited Taniguchi to launch a large-scale "mopping-up operation" in the countryside, resulting in countless deaths.

In the spring of the 27th year, Chen Wen gathered thousands of scattered soldiers and organized another Anti-Japanese Detachment. At the same time, he joined forces with other levels of anti-Japanese troops to discuss attacking the city. However, the plan was leaked to the enemy, and the rural area suffered a second "great mopping-up operation."

At that time, the people suffered under the burden of heavy taxes and levies, including so-called field taxes, anti-Japanese taxes, aircraft donations, gentry donations, and all sorts of exorbitant levies. Moreover, some bandits and military forces, under the guise of anti-Japanese resistance, extorted and plundered from the wealthy, forcibly extracting money and inflicting cruel punishments. Unfortunately, in the autumn of that year, the Beihu Lake suffered a flood, and crops in the fields near the lake were completely destroyed. The mountain fields were destroyed by windstorms, resulting in no harvest at all.

In the spring of the 28th year, the various levels of anti-Japanese troops and Chen Wen's detachment were all defeated by the enemy. Only the local people's Anti-Japanese Brigade remained. Later, a man named Lu Qingyuan emerged to merge them, forming the Jiangdu County Regular Force to confront the enemy. In the autumn of that year, the lake water had not receded, and the mountain fields were barren for miles. However, various taxes were still forcibly imposed on the impoverished people.

In the 29th year, Zhang Deyun from Tongzhou, under the guise of anti-Japanese resistance, imposed exorbitant taxes and levies in villages such as Xuxiang, Huaisi, and Huaizi. He was driven out of Jiangdu County by the Regular Force. In the autumn of that year, the lake water receded late, and the farmland near the lake only yielded half a harvest, while the mountain fields suffered from drought and yielded nothing.

In the 30th year, the Regular Force was scattered by Xie Kuaizi's attack. Zhang Jichuan, the magistrate of Jiangdu County, led his subordinates to flee to the northwest countryside. The local elders generously provided assistance, and young people eagerly joined. Under the strict search of the puppet county government, the puppet army, and the Japanese constabulary, Magistrate Zhang and his staff were able to continue their work safely, thanks to the protection of the people of the northern countryside. Especially in the spring of the following year, when the New Fourth Army also infiltrated the area, the support of the local people became even more difficult.

In the 32nd year, the traitor Wang Laohu also led a large force to occupy the area around Situ Temple, Huaizi Bridge, Gongdao Bridge, and Huangjue Bridge. He kidnapped wealthy households one by one to extort ransoms, and branded honest and upright people with the title of New Fourth Army members. If his demands were not met, he would behead them and display their heads in public. As a result, the New Fourth Army took the opportunity to provide relief to the people. Wang Laohu fought against the New Fourth Army once, but only destroyed the vitality of the local area, and finally fled in defeat. At this time, the New Fourth Army implemented the following three policies: First, destroy temples. All temples and monasteries in the northwest countryside, regardless of their age, were burned down to prevent any future military forces from occupying them.

Second, overthrow capital. All property of wealthy local households was divided into small portions and distributed to the poor. However, during the division process, heavy taxes and levies were imposed by the so-called "Farmers' Resistance Association."

Third, implement purges. All Kuomintang members, young people who participated in the resistance, and gentry who supported the government were either killed or arrested.

Under these circumstances, farmers in the rural areas fled to the city in large numbers. The pain of families broken, people dead, and displacement was truly indescribable. On one hand, they had to support the resistance and supply the needs of the county government operating underground. On the other hand, they could not return home and could not cultivate their fields. On one hand, they were under the oppressive power of the enemy and the puppets. Such triple suffering persisted until victory.

With the arrival of victory, the farmers originally hoped to return to their villages. What was recovered were only five or six townships, most were occupied. Many are unable to return home and are day and night. Some evil gentry are in control of the relief society, resulting in displaced people not being able to reasonably obtain relief, and complaints are everywhere.

"Three points military affairs, seven points politics" – this wise slogan of the highest authorities was not only a standard during the War of Resistance but has even greater importance after victory. After Jiangdu suffered from the ravages of war and the abuse of the Communist Party, the local authorities' various measures at this time should be especially cautious, seeking reasonableness and fairness. Otherwise, after the people have harbored grievances, it is easy for them to take risks. Taking the example of the councilors designated by Jiangdu County this time, there is truly no way to remain silent.

Among the councilors designated by Jiangdu County this time, Gao Yisun, for example, once served as a councilor in the puppet Third Division. Tian Yueqiu used to be a doctor in a Japanese hospital, colluding with the enemy and puppets in the past, exploiting the people. Gao Yu was formerly a propagandist for the puppet Nanjing Youth Corps (alias Gao Sanli). Speaker Zhu Ganchen opened the Fucheng Grain Shop outside Bianyi Gate during the puppet organization period, using manager Zhan Hegao to serve as the chairman of the Rice Industry Association, manipulating the county's food supply to aid the enemy, oppressing fellow businesses to donate, and hosting joint ventures to ingratiate himself with the enemy. Deputy Speaker Yu Peiren, during the enemy-puppet period (years 28 and 29), was in Shangxinzhen, Zhenjiang Third District, under the alias Ding Jian, serving as the director of slaughter tax and business tax, and also concurrently running the Xinzhen Daily, spreading poison and advocating for the enemy and puppets. All of the above is well known to the people of Jiangdu. How can the people bear to have these people chosen as their representatives?

Do not lose the people's hearts. We deeply hope that the authorities can pay attention to all political measures in this important town in northern Jiangsu. Written in Shanghai on May 25th.

### British and American Experts Test the Power of the Atomic Bomb in Germany, Absolute Secrecy Maintained, Viewing Strictly Prohibited

— Special Translation by This Newspaper

Assuming an atomic war is to occur in the near future – say, next year or the year after – you can safely hide underground, or even in bomb-proof reinforced concrete structures like the submarine pens built by the Germans in Bremen, without any danger whatsoever.

Assuming the atomic war occurs later. Then, no matter whether you hide in the air, on the ground, or underground, you cannot avoid danger. In other words, if the secret obtained by British and American experts by testing bombing power on a large steel-reinforced concrete structure built by the German Labor Youth Corps is discovered by other countries, then the danger of atomic war will be difficult to avoid. Everyone should know that current atomic bombs cannot completely cope with offensive warfare, as the imagination caused by the aftermath of the bombing of Hiroshima. For example, according to experts presiding over the Bremen test, no bomb can blast through Germany's submarine pens, which are currently the most indestructible structures in the world. It cannot damage the underground factory in Moosbierbaum near Munich, and deeper tunnels or underground passages are of course even safer.

If the German Labor Youth Corps had known earlier and built defensive projects like those built in Moosbierbaum and other places in time, then German industry would not have been damaged by air raids, and perhaps the war would still be continuing.

Eliminating the Final Obstacle to Bomb Resistance

Penetrating Deeply into Bombing Targets

Currently, there is no way to make an atomic bomb penetrate metal or reinforced concrete before it explodes, or to drill underground and cause an artificial earthquake in basements or tunnels. If a war breaks out, the enemy will definitely hide under massive metal or rock defenses to avoid danger. Therefore, British and American experts are now studying how to strike the enemy's methods.

Indeed, they must eliminate the final obstacle resisting bombs. They are conducting this work in Bremen, guarded by troops of the British Royal Air Force throughout the entire area, prohibiting outsiders from viewing and maintaining absolute secrecy. The latest British and American bombers are throwing various bombs – including eleven-ton British-style large bombs and four thousand five hundred-pound American "Disney" rocket bombs – towards a structure one-quarter mile long and one hundred yards wide. These "Disney" bombs are relatively new, resembling torpedoes and equipped with rocket engines instead of propellers. When the bomb is close to the ground, the rocket fires, using acceleration to make the bomb penetrate deep into the bombing target.

Using "Penetration Bombs," Underground Pits Lose Safety

British and American experts will have been working on this research for a year by August of this year. This work may have already been completed, and they may already have a way to make any ground building completely lose its defensive function in wartime, and to make bombs penetrate deep underground. For example, the tunnels that greatly helped London during the war will become the targets of "penetration bombs" in the future. At the same time, when they know how to load atomic bombs into "penetration bombs," even the deepest underground pits will not be safe. (United Press Agency, London, 23rd)

### Unequal Treatment of Public School Teachers

Editor: Prices are soaring, and many feel that their salaries are not enough to make ends meet. Public school teachers, despite their hard work, cannot even compare to vendors and peddlers. As a result, the demand for salary adjustments has arisen like a storm. Schools have suspended their teaching, and courts have postponed trials. The whole country is in turmoil, and everyone's stomachs are empty. The gentlemen of the Legislative Yuan have proposed a bill to adjust salaries and sent it to the Executive Yuan for implementation. While this proposal is still under deliberation, I would like to provide information on the current treatment of public school teachers for discussion, which may also be what the world wants to hear!

The War of Resistance lasted eight years, and victory has only been achieved recently. Life has been difficult for a long time. In reality, there are not many honest civil servants who starve to death. In fact, what public school teachers rely on to support themselves, in addition to their deserved salaries, often includes other income: (1) Part-time jobs. In our country, those who do more work are often paid less, and those who do less work are paid more. Middle and upper-level personnel often have time to take on part-time jobs and receive multiple salaries. However, one person's energy is limited, and no matter how capable they are, running around in multiple places prevents them from focusing their energy. For example, if a person holds three positions, it still takes three people to accomplish one thing. The country spends the same amount of money but still does the same amount of work. Money is not saved, and more work is not done. There is no economic benefit for either the individual or the country. Moreover, lower-level staff are busy and cannot take on part-time jobs, which is extremely unfair. (2) Nominal positions. Higher-level staff whose salaries are insufficient often have their wives or children hold nominal positions in other organizations to supplement their income. This is like having redundant staff who receive pay for doing nothing, which is common in official circles. (3) Salary increases. When salaries are insufficient, personal salary grades are increased. Laborers are promoted to trainees, and trainees are promoted to staff. Everyone is demanding increases from above and below, so that the salaries of university janitors are almost the same as those of university presidents, and the salaries of the Minister of Economic Affairs are not much different from those of state-owned factory workers. We certainly do not want to see the remnants of the class system again, and we certainly do not want honest officials who bear heavy responsibilities for the country to be constantly distracted by hunger and cold. (4) Special allowances. Some organizations with revenue invent various excuses to provide special allowances to staff, such as travel expenses, meal allowances, advances, or prepayment of several months' salary. (5) Ghost employees. Inflating the number of employees and dividing up the salaries of ghost employees is most commonly heard in the military. The recent incident at a police station in a certain place is still fresh in our minds. There are too many acts that violate national law. I dare not imagine them here and do not want to say more.

From what has been seen above, the current treatment of public school teachers is not only unreasonably low, but the methods are also uneconomical and unfair. As a member of the public school teaching staff, based on what I have seen and heard, I believe that under the flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun, the majority of public school teachers or military police can maintain their integrity and diligently serve the public. In order to prevent demoralization and people from going astray in the future, in addition to the "amount" of treatment, which the authorities will naturally plan comprehensively and which I cannot presume to advise on at this time, I would like to propose a few points regarding the "methods" of adjusting treatment and urge the authorities to pay attention. These have significant implications for the national budget, administrative efficiency, public morale, and even ideological beliefs: (1) There should be no additional pay for holding multiple positions; (2) redundant staff and cumbersome organizations should be eliminated; (3) all organizations should be ordered to re-fairly review and approve staff quotas; (4) special allowances and disguised salary increases should be eliminated; (5) those who abuse public office for private gain should be severely punished. The War of Resistance has been won, and although all citizens cannot afford to indulge in enjoyment, how can the government bear to have people serve the public with empty stomachs! If the aforementioned methods can be implemented effectively, with this support, then even if the amount of treatment is reasonably adjusted, it may not necessarily lead to a malignant increase in national treasury expenditures. This not only conforms to economic principles but also prevents unequal distribution. I ask for the opinion of wise men on what they think is appropriate. Respectfully submitted by a member of the public school teaching staff. May 23rd.

### Corrections

(1)

To the esteemed editors: Recently, I read a letter from Mr. Shou Kang on May 8th in the "Reader Opinions" column of your esteemed newspaper on May 18th, titled "Traitors Still Seem to Be Thriving." The following is a response to the sections involving this government: (1) This county's Fifth District residents Xu Chao, Yuan Zhonghan, and others filed a complaint with the Pacification Supervision Group against Song Guoan, Xing Xiaoshan, Chen Caiqing, and others for killing and extorting under the guise of anti-Japanese resistance. The group transferred the case to this county's court for handling. At that time, because the case was already under military judicial review by the local government and this county's judicial office had not yet become independent, the county magistrate was still concurrently handling judicial functions. In order to facilitate investigation and unify authority, it was appropriate to handle the cases together. Unexpectedly, Gao Yiming, the judicial review officer of this county, did not obtain the approval of his superior and rashly issued a summons that did not conform to the prescribed format. The county magistrate's authority was not to be ignored. He sent a secretary to inquire at around 5:00 PM on April 10th. At that time, the case had just been questioned and Gao Yiming announced the end of the interrogation. Therefore, he stopped it. The review officer has now been dismissed by the High Court, and the defendants in the case, Chen Caiqing, Huang Cailin, and others, have been arrested during the inspection of the Fifth District by County Magistrate Wang. After questioning them in person, he took them to the county for interrogation, and the case is proceeding according to law. (2) According to legal regulations, traitor cases fall under the jurisdiction of the High Court as the first instance, and the county government has no right to hear them and can only assist in the investigation. The traitor crime investigation committees in various counties are also investigative bodies and cannot take direct action. In recent months, this government has been ordered to investigate more than a dozen traitor cases, including Zhu Youcai, Zhu Youde, Zhou Sheng, Lu Jie, Wu Shiyi, Huang Jiaben, etc., some of which have been sent to the High Court for legal proceedings, and others are in progress. I have always admired your newspaper's strict stance and am writing this letter to you specifically in the hope that you will publish this letter to set the record straight and to strengthen our friendship. Respectfully, Chuansha County Government. (May 18, 35th year)

Dear Reporter: In the Reader Opinions column of your newspaper on May 20th, an article titled "The Dark and Bleak District Chief" was published, the content of which does not correspond to the facts. After Zhu Jiajiao was liberated, three district chiefs came here. None of them had done these facts. The cleaning company with relative influence, its income is being used for local purposes. There is a committee to handle things but it used to be contracted out to private entities and now it is all public. Other things like rice shops closing down, protecting gambling, and smoking opium are all lacking any foundation in reality. Hope that you will publish this letter for the sake of justice and to avoid confusion. Wishing you peace!

### Congratulating the Establishment of the Shanghai Branch of the National Federation of Industries

— Yi

The Shanghai branch of the National Federation of Industries of China has recently announced its establishment after several months of preparation. The declaration listed the following six goals for future work:

(1) To promote the enactment of the Industrial Association Law.

(2) To complete the construction of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Industrial Plan.

(3) To implement the national industrialization goal.

(4) To intensify industrial economic research.

(5) To properly arrange postwar industrial facilities.

(6) To pay attention to the contribution of amending commercial treaties.

The progress is divided into four points: organizational work, reporting work, academic research work, and investigative work.

Indeed, during the War of Resistance, many factories moved west with the Nationalist army, making indelible contributions to the war effort. After the victory, most factories encountered unexpected difficulties, and people generally had a precarious sense of panic about the future of Chinese industry. If China's economy is to seek recovery in the future, then the prerequisite is to revitalize Chinese industry, solve current difficulties, and plan future development.

To achieve this goal, individual strength alone cannot accomplish it. It is necessary to apply the power of the masses. Therefore, the most important thing in fact is the organizational aspect of the work, as the association said in its statement on the prospects for future work: "The strength of a group depends entirely on the soundness of the group's organization," and "Members of all industries should unite, be consistent in their dealings with the outside world, eliminate past destructive divisive work such as jealousy, provocation, misunderstanding, or alienation among the same industry, and should help each other, be harmonious, and unite with the spirit of living and dying together."

Now that the Shanghai branch has been announced and the directors and supervisors have been elected and taken office, it is hoped that the association will be able to follow the established guidelines and earnestly work to save the endangered Chinese industry and lay the foundation for future development.

### A Visit to the Li Xing Great Wall Brand Vacuum Flask Factory and an Interview on the Recovery Situation

— Ba Ling

The vacuum flask is a necessity of daily life. In recent years, whether in remote rural areas or in small and large households, everyone has to have one or two vacuum flasks for washing and drinking. The reporter, wanting to understand the manufacturing process of vacuum flasks and the current situation of the industry, specifically visited the Li Xing "Great Wall Brand" Vacuum Flask Factory, famous in society for its "crystal glass liner flasks," which is something that those concerned about industry and commerce would be happy to hear!

Thanks to the reception by Mr. Gan Dounan, the manager of the factory, the reporter was able to tour the entire factory. Mr. Gan said: Li Xing Factory was founded in the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929). At that time, he realized that the vacuum flask was not only a daily household item, but also a boon for travelers. However, for many years it had been imported from abroad, resulting in profit outflow, which was truly distressing. At the same time, because Japanese vacuum flasks were flooding the market, Mr. Gan, in order to promote domestic goods and compete with Japanese goods, decided to raise funds to establish the "Li Xing" Vacuum Flask Factory on Qimei Road in Zhabei, and used "Great Wall Brand" as the trademark, with the meaning of "strengthening national defense." After the establishment of Li Xing Factory, it immediately began manufacturing various types of vacuum flasks to meet market demand. Because of the excellent quality of its products, business flourished. Later, a distribution office was established in Deming Lane on Jixiang Street as a hub for business dealings. Since the advent of the "Great Wall Brand" Vacuum Flask Factory, due to its superior quality and durability, the people of the country have been happy to purchase it, reclaiming a considerable amount of profit rights. This achievement is truly indelible.

Unfortunately, the "August 13th" Anti-Japanese War broke out, and the enemy invaded Shanghai. The factory site happened to be in the line of fire. Mr. Gan's crystallization of more than ten years of hard work was completely sacrificed in the enemy's artillery fire. The extent of the loss was truly inestimable. However, Mr. Gan did not become passive, but instead became even more active. In the spring of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), under Mr. Gan's leadership, Li Xing Factory built more than a hundred factory buildings at the intersection of Gordon Road and Lipu Road, employing more than 300 workers, resuming work, and actively producing. It also reorganized the internal structure, implemented strict management, built worker dormitories, and arranged special hospital appointments to protect worker health. It established training classes to cultivate technical talents. During leisure time, it provided considerable education to enable workers to increase their knowledge and settle down to work happily, achieving the effect of labor-management cooperation. Based on years of experience, it invented the "crystal glass liner flask," setting a new record in the vacuum flask industry. The reporter believes that this spirit is worthy of emulation.

As for the manufacturing process of vacuum flasks, after the reporter's visit and Mr. Gan's instructions, it is known that there are three steps:

(A) Flask Liner Section - First, melt the glass and make two types of flask blanks, inner and outer. Cut off the bottom of the outer flask and the neck of the inner flask. Combine the two flasks, pull the bottom of the outer flask, cut the neck of the flask neatly, and then close the flask opening to form a flask liner. Then silver-plate and evacuate the air. The flask liner is then fully completed.

(B) Shell Manufacturing Section - Use copper sheets and shears to cut pieces that meet the standard dimensions, use a punching machine to punch out flask lids and flask shoulders, then electroplate the flask lids and flask shoulders. Then cut galvanized iron sheets into suitable pieces and use rolling machines to make shells. After adding paint, the shell manufacturing process is fully completed.

After the flask liner and shell are manufactured, the flask liner is matched with the shell to become a complete vacuum flask. If the flask liner is matched with an iron shell, it is an iron-shell vacuum flask; conversely, if the flask liner is matched with a bamboo shell, it is the currently popular bamboo-shell vacuum flask.

After the visit, Mr. Gan was asked about the current recovery situation of the industry. Mr. Gan believes that the reason why vacuum flasks have not fully recovered after victory is due to the unresolved nature of the following difficult problems.

(1) Soaring Raw Material Prices: The price of raw materials used in vacuum flasks, such as iron sheets, has increased five to six thousand times compared to pre-war levels, and the price of coal has increased fifteen thousand times. The prices of all other raw materials have increased several thousand times or more compared to pre-war levels. Whether it is possible to suit the purchasing power of the general public with such high costs is a question. Therefore, most factories are temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude and dare not rashly resume full production.

(2) Lack of Working Capital: The losses suffered by vacuum flask manufacturers during the Anti-Japanese War were extremely severe. To resume production now, it is impossible to operate without substantial capital. Therefore, it is hoped that the financial sector, especially national banks, will provide the industrial sector with large amounts of low-interest loans to help them resume work.

(3) Transportation Difficulties: Although the war has ended, transportation in various places has not yet fully recovered. The sales of vacuum flasks in major commercial ports, especially in Southeast Asia, are the largest. Since transportation has not fully recovered, the industry itself does not dare to fully resume work, so as to avoid the impact of frozen funds.

(4) Surging Labor Unrest: Due to the rising cost of living in the city, labor unrest has erupted in various industries, causing endless frustration for the industrial sector. Vacuum flask manufacturers, in view of the severity of labor unrest, dare not recruit large numbers of workers, resulting in various disputes caused by labor unrest.

### Labor-Management Cooperation Increases Production

— Meng Jiang

Recent disputes between labor and management have left mediators helpless. The pathological state of labor-management disputes in these short months is no longer about raising wages and increasing prices, or increasing prices and raising wages, resulting in the inability of the capital side to bear the expenses, and the inability to raise prices. If a fundamental solution is not sought in the future, then the remaining industries and commerce after this disaster, on the one hand, will face difficulties in sales due to increased costs, and on the other hand, will be subject to the dumping of low-priced goods from abroad, which may lead to an incurable illness.

As a result of soaring prices, purchasing power has been drastically reduced, and the sales of manufacturers have also become sluggish. Therefore, the current production volume is reduced, which is also one of the reasons due to the decline in purchasing power. At the same time, on the other hand, precisely because the production volume is reduced, there is a shortage of products. This is why, although purchasing power is extremely low today, prices are not generally declining. From the observation of the past few months, it can be seen that the current situation is no longer a cycle of rising prices and increasing wages, but a cycle of production volume and purchasing power. To address the current urgent needs and seek solutions, there is only

1. Increase production.

2. Increasing production must be based on sincere and close cooperation between labor and management.

We should be deeply convinced that after the production volume increases, prices will inevitably fall. Once prices fall, purchasing power can gradually increase. Once purchasing power gradually increases, the sales volume of industries and commerce will inevitably become active, and after the sales volume increases, more workers will inevitably be hired, reducing unemployment. The result will inevitably be a further decline in prices, which will result in a further increase in purchasing power. If we broaden our horizons and think big, in ten or twenty years, China can be like the United States today, making the people of the whole country better consumers, and able to consume better goods.

Therefore, today's workers must avoid thinking that increasing wages can solve the problem of life, and forget their own productivity. If this root concept is not changed one day, it is tantamount to suicide. The reason why American workers can occupy an advantage in the world market is that their production capacity far exceeds that of other workers. And what is pitiful is that the productivity of Chinese people is far lower than that of Americans, but today they exceed the wages that American workers can obtain; I would like to ask how the Chinese people will resist the goods manufactured in extremely specialized countries. Under the principle of mutual assistance, the capital side must not only seek personal wealth, while making laborers rich, and its own forgetful industries and commerce will never have a day of peace.

The authorities' cost-of-living adjustment index has been discussed by various parties. If the adjustment index is not appropriate, how will the principle of cooperative assistance be established? The author believes that in the future, workers' wages should be based on workers' productivity, in addition to the minimum prescribed amount. If a worker's production capacity is high, the rewards for encouragement will also be high. Workers who receive this encouragement will be devoted to work, and their skills will become more refined due to the higher rewards. However, the capital side must be able to reduce costs due to the increased general productivity of workers, and sales can be slightly loosened due to reduced costs. Is this not a win-win situation for both sides, which invisibly increases production and promotes lower prices? In addition, we certainly cannot deny that reasonable allocation and transportation of supplies, transportation issues, and political issues are all closely related and urgently need to be resolved. In short, for the sake of national construction, everyone should sacrifice some interests for the welfare of the masses, so that the entire country and society can be revitalized.

### General Situation of the Tobacco Industry

— Jun Yi

After the outbreak of the Pacific War, due to the inability to import foreign tobacco, China's tobacco once had the opportunity to rise. Before the war, the annual amount of imports consumed reached more than 500 million yuan. After the enemy seized the British American Tobacco Company, the raw materials were exhausted in less than a year, and they had to use Chinese tobacco. A Central China Tobacco Stock Company was specially set up to distribute production areas, and tobacco was included in the controlled goods list. Without the company's permit, outsiders could not collect and transport it. The cigarette factories established by them, due to the proper roasting by technical personnel, the products were not inferior to the past, so it can be seen that as long as artificial improvements are made, domestic tobacco may not be able to compete with imported products. After the victory, American cigarettes have flooded the market again. If this continues, domestic cigarette factories will inevitably be greatly affected. Fortunately, at the time of writing this article, it was reported that the United States has accepted the Chinese government's proposal to ban tobacco imports, which is indeed good news for cigarette merchants. However, tobacco is not only produced by the United States. Before the war, countries such as Turkey and India also imported into the Chinese market. Moreover, American-made cigarettes are not included in the ban, so there are still many dangers in the future, which still need to be carefully studied and improved by those who operate this industry.

China's tobacco is most abundant in Anhui and Gansu provinces. However, the latter is mostly used for local tobacco. Anhui Province has both southern and northern parts. The tobacco produced in southern Anhui is generally called local tobacco, centered on Tongcheng, which is adjacent to Anqing. Taking that place as an example, the annual output has reached 30,000 dans. Other places such as Datong, Chaoxian, Wuwei, Hexian, Luzhou, and Zhutoushan also have production, but the quality is slightly inferior. The tobacco produced in northern Anhui is mostly flue-cured tobacco, with Fengyang, Yinyang, Bengbu, and Linhuai Pass. The quantity is approximately equal to the local tobacco in southern Anhui. It is not easy for non-experts to distinguish the two, only the color is slightly more yellow than flue-cured tobacco. There are also other types such as tobacco shreds and tobacco stems, which are the tips and stems of China, and the texture is also harder.

At present, the reasons why the tobacco industry is difficult to develop are that the taxes and duties are too heavy. From the production area to the consumers, there are nearly ten types of taxes and duties. Another reason is the lack of transportation and difficulties in transportation. Taking Tongcheng to Shanghai as an example, it must go through several transfers of boats and vehicles in Datong, Tuqiao, Wuhu, and Nanjing. Most of them are waterways, and old-fashioned wooden barges are used for towing, which costs a lot of time and manpower. Moreover, whenever it rains or snows, the tobacco will become waste once it gets damp, resulting in greater losses. At present, the freight exceeds more than twice the price of tobacco in the production area. No wonder foreign tobacco, although it travels across the ocean, can still compete with domestic tobacco in the Chinese market. As for the planting of tobacco, it has still adhered to the old methods for nearly a hundred years, which is also worrying and should be paid attention to.

### General Discussion on Industrial and Commercial Management

The Importance of Psychology in Industry and Commerce

We have already discussed some of the most important principles of management in the previous section, and now we can talk about the importance of psychology.

We should think carefully about what is the biggest factor in creating a manager? Some people say that it is due to physical strength, for example, someone has a strong body, so he can take on all the important tasks of a manager, but in fact, physical strength is important, but it is not the most important point. For example, Napoleon, Carnegie, and they all had extraordinary abilities, but they were not strong people. Some people say that it is due to good congenital heredity, but many successful managers or successful entrepreneurs, their ancestors were not people of status. Some people say that it is due to a convenience at the beginning. This point is not entirely true in fact. For example, Charles Schwab, the steel king of the United States, was a worker in a steel factory. Rockefeller, one of the richest men in the world, was a bookkeeper in a very small manager's office. Many entrepreneurs who currently occupy a high position have risen from extremely humble positions.

So what is the main condition for the success of a manager in the end? It is to have a management ability. This ability is mostly mental, so to become a successful manager, the first thing is to create a sound mind.

We can give an example to illustrate how a manager can use his mind to make his business run smoothly or achieve the purpose of success. In the past, there was a large magazine publishing company in the United States. They were famous for their thoughtful service and prompt delivery. But once a section of the railway was about to be temporarily stopped, so the circulation director of the magazine company immediately tried to find another route to ensure that there was no loss in terms of time. Therefore, a manager must use his mind at all times to adapt to the environment and solve various difficult problems.

In today's world, where the trend is constantly evolving and the handling of affairs is becoming more and more complicated, it is especially necessary to develop a sound mind in order to cope and develop.

In the future, we will discuss the business aspect, with the mind as the center of discussion.

Two Kinds of Mind

In business, there are two different kinds of minds, one that is obedient to others, and the other that is empowered to others. A manager often belongs to the latter.

So how should one reach the point of being empowered to others? Then you must have the following conditions:

1. Creative Spirit No matter what kind of business, if it does not progress, it will regress. Therefore, a manager must have a creative spirit, especially when new problems arise, he must use his best efforts to solve them. Otherwise, if he blindly sticks to the old ways, the business will not progress, and the problems will not be solved.

The generation of the creative spirit is based on an automatic habit, so first you must develop an automatic habit, and put in the effort to research everything. Then you can solve various problems easily.

Because of having an automatic habit, you can have a lot of valuable experience from the daily handling of various problems. This experience can become a basis for "knowing why." Now the industrial circles in the United States attach great importance to the so-called "Know How" because being able to "know why" in everything can avoid various wrong opinions and wrong decisions.

2. Responsibility This point can be said to be connected with the automatic habit and the creative spirit. To become a successful manager, being responsible is very important. Based on the point of being willing to take responsibility, he can study the problem carefully and must seek a reasonable solution. A manager who can manage others must be able to take responsibility and bear all the consequences.
