### Direct Negotiations Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party Failed to Yield Results; Talks to Continue at Noon Today; Zhou Enlai Visited Marshal Ma Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] It is heard that five representatives of the government and the Communist Party held a two-hour meeting last night at the residence of Chief of Staff Chen Cheng at No. 8 Putuo Road. The two sides exchanged opinions on the unresolved issues of the military tripartite meeting, including the reorganization and integration of troops, the issue of the Communist army's garrison areas, and the administrative rights in northern Jiangsu. The recent sudden incidents of the Communist army's Central Plains Military Region, led by Li Xiannian, disturbing the Pinghan Railway in Xinyang and Liulin were also briefly mentioned. The Communist Party representatives, Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu, seemed to avoid the pending issues of military reorganization and garrison areas, hoping to convene the Political Consultative Conference to delay the matter. Therefore, the talks did not yield results. However, the representatives of both sides were able to calmly exchange opinions during the talks. At the end of the meeting, they agreed to continue the talks after mutual consideration. An authoritative source told our reporter that, judging from the results of the first meeting between the KMT and the Communist Party representatives last night, the crux of the current issue of the Communist army's garrison areas lies in the various political demands put forward by the Communist Party. This issue is extremely complex and unlikely to be resolved in a short period. It is expected that direct negotiations between the KMT and the Communist Party can shorten the negotiation time as much as possible.

[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] Direct negotiations between the KMT and the Communist Party began last night. At 10:30 AM today, Zhou Enlai went to Marshal Ma's residence to inform him of the progress of yesterday's talks and to discuss the future format of the talks. This afternoon, there was no activity from any party. As for the content of last night's talks, the issue remained the administrative rights after the withdrawal of the Communist army in northern Jiangsu. The Communist Party insisted on retaining administrative rights, proposing the so-called "public vote" method, while the government insisted that they should withdraw altogether. This point has not yet been agreed upon. At noon tomorrow, the two sides will continue to have direct talks at Chief of Staff Chen's residence to conduct detailed discussions on the above issues. According to observations from all parties, if this point can be agreed upon, then the remaining minor issues will be easier to resolve.

The Communist army began to attack Datong on the 22nd of last month and has occupied several villages about ten kilometers northeast and northwest of Datong, cutting off Datong's lines of communication and prohibiting local people from bringing food into the besieged city. At the same time, the Communist Party claimed that the government army surrounded and attacked the Communist army's positions in northern Hubei, which is absolutely not true. The government army still maintains its original positions. On the contrary, the Communist army is trying to break out and move elsewhere, violating the agreement.

### War in the Hubei-Henan Border Region Underway; Communist Army's Offensive Halted; Military Mediation Department Orders Cessation of Military Actions

[Our Beiping Office, 3rd] The Military Mediation Department issued an order yesterday ordering the National Army and the Communist Army in Datong and the Hubei-Henan border region to cease military actions.

[Our Beiping Office, 3rd] In the Hubei-Henan border region, two brigades of the Communist army have been moving westward across the Pinghan Railway in the area north of Guangshui, south of Yangnan, since the 29th. Another two brigades are also trying to cross.

[Our Hankou Office, 3rd] The bridges and rails near the Huayuan Station on the Pinghan Railway, which were destroyed by the Communist army, have been repaired and traffic between Hankou and Zhengzhou can resume today. However, there is still Communist army disturbance around Guangshui, and in reality it may be difficult to pass through.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 3rd] Wang Shusheng's unit, the First Column of the Communist Central Plains Military Region, consisting of 15,000 men, launched a large-scale western offensive, fiercely attacking Liulin, north of Guangshui. They have made contact with the garrison troops and their offensive has been halted. Another unit of 6,000 men attacked west from an area more than ten miles north of Huayuan and have broken through to the west of the Pinghan Railway. After being intercepted, they have all retreated.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 3rd] General Liu Ruming, commander of the Fourth Pacification Zone, recently told reporters that the main force of the Communist army led by Li Guangnian, which launched an attack on the Hubei border region, has now fled westward across the railway line, attacking the Siwang Mountains south of Xinyang and north of Bingshan. Liulin Station has been burned down by the Communist army and the fighting is still underway.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 3rd] The Pinghan Railway has been closed between Hankou and Zhengzhou because about one kilometer of the railway track near Lixingdian Station, north of Xinyang, and a small bridge near Jiajiagang, south of Huayuan, were destroyed by the Communist army.

### Cheng Qian Receives Reporters, Reports on Communist Army's Offensive

[Our Hankou Office, 3rd] Director Cheng of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters received reporters this afternoon and delivered a speech. After detailing the government's repeated tolerance of the Communist Party in seeking a peaceful solution, Cheng reported on the recent offensive launched by the Communist army in the Central Plains region. He stated that since June 24th, the main force of Li Guangnian's unit has concentrated in the area between Panjiadian, Dingyuandian, and Xuanhuadian, and has fiercely attacked the Pinghan Railway between Xinyang and Huayuan. On the first of this month, they engaged in fierce battles with the National Army along the line from Yangpingkou, Daxindian, and Jigong Mountain to the south of Xinyang. One unit crossed the railway north of Huayuan at Weijiadian, another unit fled to the Baliwan area of Huangpi, and another unit fled east from Jingfu to the vicinity of Futianhe. Wherever they went, they destroyed communications and telecommunications, and brutally killed the old, weak, women, and children. The situation is still deteriorating. The garrison headquarters has the responsibility to defend the territory and protect the people, and cannot but take self-defense actions. If the situation further escalates, the National Army will take effective measures to stop it. When reporters asked about the strength of the Communist army and other recent attempts, Cheng replied that the strength of the Communist army in the garrison headquarters' jurisdiction is about 60,000 men. Their current attempts are to disrupt political consultation through military action in an attempt to delay time, and to jump out of the Central Plains Military Region and gather towards the Soviet camp in order to realize their conspiracy to transform small groups into a whole.

[Our Beiping Office, 3rd] Military officials claim: The Communist army has newly deployed 80,000 troops from Zhangjiakou and is pressing towards Datong. There are now 20,000 Communist troops pressing Gushan (north of Datong), 20,000 pressing Julebao (east of Datong), and 20,000 pressing Qingcijing (west of Datong). The Communist army occupying Shuoxian is also directing its main force north towards Datong. The situation there is on the eve of a storm. Ningwu, south of Yanghukou on the Inner Great Wall line, is also under fierce attack by the Communist army in northwestern Shanxi. Xuan'gang Town to its south has been captured.

### Communist Army Dismantles Hongze Lake Embankment Stones, Causing Flooding in Northern Jiangsu; Refugees Appeal, Urging the Communist Party to Rescind the Order

[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] Truth News Agency: The Communist army in northern Jiangsu, in order to commemorate its late Commander of the Third Division of the New Fourth Army, Peng Xuefeng, is mobilizing nearby people to dismantle a portion of the flagstones of the Hongze Lake embankment and transport them to Anhui to build the "Xuefeng Pagoda." As a result, the water level in the Grand Canal in northern Jiangsu has risen sharply. The water level at Yumato Wharf in Gaoyou has risen from 1.1 zhang to 1.8 zhang in a week, and it is heard that it is still increasing. If no measures are taken to remedy the situation, northern Jiangsu will become a swamp. Recently, representatives of refugees from more than 20 counties in northern Jiangsu issued an appeal to the new world, begging the Communist Party to "show mercy" and rescind the order, and not to implement this measure. Otherwise, even if the three million refugees achieve their desire to return home, they will still have no home to return to.

### Traitor Lu Daoying Sentenced to Life Imprisonment; Heard the Verdict and Was Pleasantly Surprised, Repeatedly Saying "Thank You!"; Traitor He Bingxian Tried Yesterday, Testimony of Witnesses Was Biased

[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] Lu Daoying, the former head of the Shanghai Police Bureau, was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Capital High Court at 3:00 PM this afternoon. Presiding Judge Jin Shiding explained that Lu Daoying, during his tenure as head of the puppet police bureau, trained special agents, destroyed the central government's underground work in Shanghai, and killed patriotic youths. His crime was unforgivable. However, it was found that Lu Daoying had indeed raised 3 million in education funding and provided relief to displaced youths, so he was given a lighter sentence at discretion. The main text of the verdict was: "Lu Daoying colluded with the enemy country, plotting rebellion against this country, sentenced to life imprisonment, deprivation of public rights for life, and all property confiscated except for a reasonable amount for the living expenses of his family."

### Economic Planning Conference: Yesterday's Discussion Centered on Commodity Prices; Committee Members Unanimously Agreed that Addressing the Root Causes is Paramount to Stabilizing Prices; The Issue of Rescuing the Industrial Crisis was Referred to a Subcommittee for Review.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The Economic Planning Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs continued its fourth and fifth meetings separately on the morning of the 3rd. The main topic of discussion in the morning remained "Rescuing the Industrial Crisis" from the afternoon of the previous day, while the afternoon discussion focused on "Commodity Price Issues." Due to the numerous interconnections between these topics, the committee members frequently referenced each other's remarks. As a result, the topic of "Rescuing the Industrial Crisis" was temporarily concluded before the fourth recess at 12:30 noon upon the chairman's announcement. The "Commodity Price Issues" will continue to be studied at the sixth meeting tomorrow morning. During the morning meeting, in addition to several committee members continuing to state the difficulties currently faced in managing industries, the issue of wages was the subject of prolonged and focused study. There was considerable debate and discussion on whether wages should continue to rise along with future commodity price indices. Some committee members also proposed supplementary measures such as "gradation." Finally, seventeen committee members, including Zhang Naiqi and Li Zhuchen, submitted a written proposal on the topic of "Rescuing the Industrial Crisis." It was decided to merge it with the new measures proposed by Committee Member Wu Qiyuan to restrict imports. A seven-member subcommittee was formed, consisting of Wu Qiyuan, Li Zhuchen, Li Junlong, Zhang Naiqi, Gao Shukung, Hu Ziang, and Dong Bingqi, a representative from the Ministry of Finance, to convene tonight and review the matter, submitting the results to the general meeting for discussion. During the afternoon's discussion on "Commodity Price Issues," the committee members first expressed their opinions separately on the discussion outline proposed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, unanimously agreeing that addressing the root causes is paramount to stabilizing prices. Given the current instability of national defense and political situation, immediate results are difficult to achieve. However, negative measures such as control, rationing, industrial loans, subsidies, and tax systems should also be carefully reviewed first. In addition, Dong Bingqi, the representative from the Ministry of Finance, and Jin Shihong, the representative from the Ministry of Communications, who attended the meeting, reported on the recent financial situation and the transportation situation, respectively. Among these, the issue of commodity price controls proved to be the most difficult to handle, but there was a common understanding on both sides, namely that control is not absolutely unnecessary at this time and place, but technical problems must be carefully improved in order to achieve practical results. Until 6:45 PM, the committee members continued to request the floor, and the chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting due to the lateness of the hour.

The number of universities established and students trained will all follow this principle. (3) Raise academic standards and promote a research-oriented academic atmosphere to reach world standards. To achieve the above goals, eight higher education centers will be established throughout China: (1) Beijing, with Yenching University as the highest institution of learning, and a graduate school will be established. (2) Jinan, Qilu University will focus on medicine, science, and rural construction education. (3) In Shanghai, St. John's University, Soochow University, the University of Shanghai, and Hujiang University will jointly form a large, top-tier institution of learning with six colleges: arts, science, engineering, commerce, medicine, and law.

All of the above fourteen universities that accept this plan will receive full financial support. The 'United Board for Christian Colleges in China' has decided on a five-year 'economic plan' to raise a fund of US$15 million. Its use is: the first five million US dollars will be used for the restoration expenses of each school; the second five million US dollars will be used for the current expenses of the next five years; the third five million US dollars will be used for development expenses. In addition, large sums will be requested from the Chinese government and raised from all sectors of Chinese society to realize this plan."

After taking a short rest upon his return to Shanghai, he will begin his scheduled eight-week inspection flight, touring the above eight Christian education centers.

### Editorial: This Year's July 4th - A Review and Prospect of Philippine Independence

July 4th is the Independence Day of the United States of America; this year's July 4th is also the National Day of the Republic of the Philippines, marking its declaration of independence. After 48 years of American protection, the Philippines is now an independent and free country. China, the United States, and the Philippines are all Pacific nations. We want to congratulate the United States and even more so the Philippines!

The question of Philippine independence has been raised several times in the past. The relationship between the United States and the Philippines has historically stood in stark contrast to the relationship between Britain and India. Indians have repeatedly sought independence, but the British government has been reluctant to grant it. The people of the Philippines, on the other hand, have not been particularly eager for independence, and in the past, the Americans have been the ones to want them to be independent. This peculiar situation can only be explained by the Philippines' geographic location. The Philippines is situated between Japan and the United States, and Japan has always had ambitions towards the Philippines. The Philippines' own military strength, currently only 40,000 regular troops, is certainly insufficient to resist Japanese aggression. Without American assistance, true independence would be an illusion. However, on the American side, when isolationists were on the rise, they were unwilling to risk international disputes by protecting the Philippines. As for the economy, even if the United States did not lose money, it would at least not gain much profit. Therefore, in the eyes of American isolationists, the Philippines seemed somewhat of a burden to the United States. Now that Japanese power has collapsed, both sides are willing to maintain an independent relationship, which is certainly a natural development. However, in economic and military terms, many Filipinos are still very anxious, believing that independence would mean losing urgently needed assistance from the United States and are thus willing to postpone the period of independence.

During this recent election, Osmeña advocated for independence, while Roxas had his spokesperson, Alvirin Raro, declare in his stead for postponement. Roxas, however, won the election. This reflects, at least in part, that Filipinos are very willing to be independent, but due to the circumstances, this willingness is tinged with some anxiety.

The new Philippine President Roxas is a progressive figure. During the Japanese occupation, Roxas commanded guerrilla forces to continue fighting against the Japanese until he was captured by the Japanese and briefly joined the puppet government, but his position was not high. He is a very capable person, and General MacArthur has expressed particular confidence in him. After successfully winning the election, he announced his policies: first, to rebuild the Philippines, and second, to cooperate thoroughly with the United States. These two paths can be said to be interconnected. Even today, the Republic of the Philippines still seems to lack the strength to completely break away from the United States. Without American help, Philippine independence and reconstruction would undoubtedly be very difficult. Political independence is one thing, but economic and military independence are quite another.

If the international situation can be resolved peacefully, the United States may be willing to completely let go of the Philippines, and Filipinos will undoubtedly be even more willing to gain complete freedom and independence. As the current situation stands, the Philippines still needs its caretaker to look after it at all times. Here, we would like to urge the Chinese nation to also pay attention to this basic principle of nation-building: If a country cannot be economically independent and militarily self-sufficient, then political independence alone is still somewhat dangerous.

According to the new agreement, the Philippines and the United States will continue to cooperate. In military terms, the 7,000 islands will be entirely developed by the Philippines itself for national defense, but the United States Navy will retain all of its bases on the islands. This is welcomed by the Filipinos; they cannot but welcome it, because with this protection, the Philippines can be safe from aggression by any ambitious country. Even in diplomatic terms, the United States will still help train personnel for the Philippine government so that they can be assigned as ambassadors and ministers in the future. Regarding the economy, cooperation between the two countries will be strengthened.

We feel that the attitude of the United States is very different from what it used to be. In the past, apart from foreign trade, it only wanted to close its doors and ignore the affairs of the world. The United States used to seem like a wealthy young man, well-fed and well-clothed, leisurely and carefree, who would run away quickly when he saw others fighting, afraid of getting blood splattered on his clothes. This World War has given her a painful lesson! Americans have deeply realized that the Monroe Doctrine is not suitable for modern trends. World security requires full cooperation from all countries to build and maintain a balanced power. Once this balance is shaken, ambitious individuals will seize the opportunity. After the First World War, the United States did not fully support China, which aroused Japan's ambitions; the United States did not actively intervene in European politics, which created the opportunity for German aggression. Now, the United States not only does not take a bystander's attitude towards the Philippines, but also, towards any corner of the world, as long as it discovers elements that threaten peace, it is immediately willing to take active action. For example, regarding Trieste being assigned to Yugoslavia, the United States in the past would never have opposed this so resolutely.

From an outsider's perspective, this attitude of the United States is helpful for world peace. We sincerely hope that the world's current powerful nations will not only refrain from aggressing against others themselves but will also cooperate with each other to actively eliminate any elements that could cause war or tempt ambitious individuals. Peace-loving and powerful nations cannot close their doors and stand idly by, watching the world's affairs, because once a fire breaks out and continues to spread, it can quickly burn down their own comfortable houses.

We want to congratulate the people of the Philippines that the Republic of the Philippines can achieve political independence today. We especially hope that the Republic of the Philippines can also truly achieve military and economic independence in the near future. We want to praise the American spirit of "treating the small with greatness," this spirit of maintaining world peace. Today, the United States has not completely abandoned its support for the Philippines, nor has it abandoned its responsibility for any country in the world that needs help. This is a manifestation of its great spirit.

Finally, we believe that under the leadership of the capable President Roxas, all aspects of the Philippines will make rapid progress. We further hope that after China's recent peaceful unification, since China, the United States, and the Philippines are all located in the Pacific, China can provide greater sympathy and help to the United States of America and the Republic of the Philippines so that they can work together to maintain world peace forever.

### President Roxas' Message: Encouraging Filipinos to Strive for the Country

[United States Information Service, Washington, 2nd] Philippine President Roxas and Philippine Commissioner to the United States Brigadier General Romulo issued separate messages regarding the Philippines becoming an independent republic on July 4th. Roxas' message was directed at Filipinos in the United States and stated that Filipinos anywhere in the world today have not only a new dignity but also a new responsibility. Filipinos can rejoice in the glory of their new status as citizens of a new nation. As free citizens of a free nation, they can immediately join a proud group of free people from all countries and all times. But the responsibilities of Philippine citizenship are significant and require helping the country through all the difficulties of the future. We have absolutely accepted the obligation to use our own will to achieve self-reliance. Only if we make good use of all the resources we have can we obtain the cooperation and assistance of other countries in the world and earn their respect. Only in this way can we be worthy of the ancestors who fought for freedom and the heroes who shed their blood and died for the nation. America's assistance to us is unprecedented in history, and it is our responsibility not to betray their trust.

### Wu Tiecheng's Congratulatory Telegram

The telegram stated: "On the occasion of your esteemed country's Independence Day, please accept my most sincere congratulations. You bravely resisted the Japanese army's invasion of your territory, and your determination to build a strong nation to become a member of the international community fully proves that you are worthy of being the people of an independent nation. As a close friend of the late President Quezon, I have always held high hopes for you. I am deeply gratified to see that President Quezon's lifelong efforts have not been in vain. President Roxas is a leader who enjoys popular support, and with his succession to the late President's legacy, he will surely lead your country to accomplish the glorious mission that it cannot shirk in the international community."

### Wishing for the Maintenance of Close Ties Between the United States and the Philippines

Statement Issued by the U.S. Secretary of the Army

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 2nd] July 4, 1946, is the Philippine Independence Day. U.S. Secretary of the Army Patterson issued the following statement:

"As the Filipino people achieve complete independence, I and all the soldiers of the U.S. Army extend our congratulations to them. July 4th is not only the Independence Day of the Philippines but also of the United States. The celebration of this double anniversary will undoubtedly be even more joyous. Whether in the present or in the future, this commemoration holds dual significance for our two nations, namely the independence of the West and the independence of the East.

During the years when the Philippines was under U.S. rule, the Filipino people made remarkable progress in preparing for full independence, which ultimately fostered the closest friendly ties between our two nations. The friendship of the American soldiers who served in the Philippines and the Americans who befriended the Filipinos is particularly close. During the fierce war against Japan, our soldiers had close contact with the Filipino people, and we deeply admire the fortitude of the people of the new republic.

We are honored to join with all nations in welcoming this heroic nation into the international community. We wish this new democracy success in its efforts for peace and prosperity, and that it will seize the opportunity to contribute to the happiness and well-being of mankind."

### Stimson Sends a Telegram Wishing for the Prosperity of the Philippines

[United Press, New York, 3rd] Former U.S. Secretary of War Stimson today sent a telegram congratulating the Philippines on its independence, saying, "I wish to take this historically significant day to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Filipino people. For forty years, I have been deeply concerned about the welfare of the Filipino people. In 1920, I lived on the beautiful island of the Philippines in the capacity of Governor-General, living among the local people, and my concern turned into affection. I subsequently returned home to serve as Secretary of War. The American and Filipino people fought together and achieved victory. I witnessed the brave and loyal resistance of the Filipino people to the brutal Japanese invasion. Now that the Filipino people have joined the ranks of the world's major powers, they must also shoulder significant responsibilities and face serious dangers. Fortunately, the Filipino people have had years of experience in self-governance, and their capabilities are increasing daily. I sincerely hope that they will continue to forge ahead, promoting peace and prosperity. The United States and the Philippines have a long history of interaction and deep understanding, and this new relationship should not lead to discord. The American people will certainly continue to observe the prosperity of our Filipino friends with sympathy, concern, and affection."

### Mrs. Roosevelt Hopes for the Completion of a Great Undertaking

[United Press, New York, Hyde Park, 3rd] Mrs. Roosevelt, the President's wife, published an article in the Manila Bulletin today on the independence of the Philippines, stating that all Americans should feel pleased that the Philippines has achieved independence. The Filipino people have endured the ravages of war, and now that they are beginning self-governance, the work will be even more arduous. There is much to be done to complete the great undertaking of reconstruction and nation-building. The United States has had a close relationship with the Philippines for many years, and it is hoped that this relationship will continue, assisting the Filipino people in their reconstruction and cooperating closely with them economically and culturally. The Philippines has achieved independence through its own efforts and with the help of the United States, and all Americans should be proud of this.

### Any Disputes Can Be Resolved Amicably - There Is Absolutely No Reason for War Between the United States and the Soviet Union - Statement by the New Soviet Ambassador to the United States

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] Soviet Ambassador to the United States Novikov, who took office last month, made his first statement to American reporters today, stating that there is absolutely no reason for war between the Soviet Union and the United States. He understands that the American people do not want the Soviet Union or any country to launch a war, and the Soviet Union will never launch a war against the United States or any other country. Therefore, any disputes between the United States and the Soviet Union can be resolved peacefully.

### U.S. Senate and House of Representatives Pass the U.S.-Philippine Relations Act - Truman Signs the Filipino Naturalization Act

[Central News Agency, Manila, 3rd, United Press] The U.S. Senate and House of Representatives have passed the government's proposed bill, accepting the administrative agreement signed by President Truman and Philippine President Roxas to implement the Bell Trade Act, which stipulates that close ties between the United States and the Philippines will be maintained for 28 years.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd, United Press] Truman has signed the Filipino Naturalization and East Indian Immigration Act. He has also signed an executive order to remove all organized Philippine units from the U.S. military. This order went into effect at midnight on June 20th. The Philippine military was incorporated into the U.S. military on July 16, 1941.

### The U.S. Government Fulfills its Promise - Philippine Independence is Realized - Demonstration to New and Old Imperialism

The Philippines formally became independent on July 4th. The significance is self-evident. Below is the evaluation of the significance of this independence by U.S. News & World Report:

"It is unprecedented in modern history for a nation to voluntarily grant independence to a racially different, resource-rich colony. The formal realization of this move on July 4th will have a profound impact on colonies and oppressed peoples around the world. This is the United States' response to old Western imperialism and new Eastern imperialism."

The Process of Independence

According to the "Tydings-McDuffie Act" passed by the U.S. Senate in 1934, the Philippines would completely break away from its status as a U.S. colony and begin independence on July 4, 1946.

The Philippines also encountered some twists and turns in its struggle for independence. During the presidential election campaign in 1940, there were two different views on the independence movement in the country. One faction, represented by former President Quezon, supported Philippine independence, while the other faction, represented by Varga, advocated turning the Philippines into a state of the United States and was able to gain the sympathy and support of some Americans. Under these circumstances, Quezon was unable to join hands with another candidate, Osmeña. They formed an agreement, promising that after winning the election, Quezon would serve as president and Osmeña as vice president. Under these superior conditions, Varga was of course defeated.

However, just as the Philippines was advancing towards the road to independence, the Pacific War broke out in 1941. After major changes such as the retreat of the U.S. military, the occupation by the Japanese army, and the return of the U.S. military, the post-war Philippines was naturally significantly different from five years earlier. Therefore, since the Philippines was liberated from the Japanese army, the issue of independence has once again become the focus of discussion. At that time, some people also advocated that the Philippines should not implement independence for the time being. However, the United States had a very clear attitude on this issue. U.S. Senator Tydings immediately went to the local area on behalf of the U.S. President to conduct a very detailed investigation and study after the Philippines was liberated. After returning to the United States, he submitted a report to the President, resolutely advocating that "the independence of the Philippines is already an undoubted issue." U.S. Commissioner to the Philippines McNutt also said: "We have promised to grant independence to the Filipinos on July 4, 1946. If the Filipinos do not want to obtain this status, the initiative should belong to the Filipinos. The United States will never take the initiative. The independence of the Philippines is no longer a question. Our work is how to prepare the Filipinos for independence and should firmly move towards this goal." All of this shows how thoroughly the United States is fulfilling its past promises and wants to make its credibility clear to the world.

Roxas Wins

Now, the Philippines has decided to implement independence on July 4th. This is a major good news for the Far East and even the world. We want to congratulate the Filipinos on their bright future!

The first president of the independent Philippines has been decided by the election held in April of this year to be Roxas. In order to explain the political development of the Philippines, let us briefly describe the process of Roxas's election victory.

In this election, there were two powerful presidential candidates: one was Osmeña, who flew to the United States with President Quezon after the outbreak of the Pacific War and the Philippines fell into enemy hands. After Quezon died of illness, he succeeded him as president and returned triumphantly with the U.S. military after the recovery of the Philippines; the other was Roxas, the President of the Philippine Senate, who was able to win the sympathy of the masses, and the underground workers who stayed in the Philippines during the war were also led by Roxas, with outstanding achievements.

Before this election, Osmeña thought he had an absolute advantage because he felt that several points were in his favor: (1) He was still the President of the Philippines at the time, and the existing environmental conditions gave him a lot of convenience; (2) His strong opponent, Roxas, stayed in the Philippines during the war, which was criticized by some people; (3) He condoned the Communist Party in order to gain their support in the election; (4) He had some capitalists behind him to support him. But the result was that Roxas won and Osmeña failed, which was beyond everyone's expectations!

In fact, Roxas's victory was not without reason: (1) He was Quezon's direct descendant and received the support of Mrs. Quezon; (2) He maintained close contact with the guerrillas during the war and gained their trust; (3) He advocated eliminating the Communist Party in order to maintain the security of the entire Philippines; (4) He received support from Spanish capitalists.

In addition, Roxas is an excellent propagandist and politician with a strong sense of nationalism, able to propose moving policies to win the support of the majority of the people. On the other hand, Osmeña is not good at speech, is old and likes to be quiet, and is a little neglectful in all aspects, giving the other party a chance to counterattack.

Future Prospects

Roxas has stepped forward to take on a difficult job. He believes in the noble goals and strong capabilities of the United States. Roxas is a powerful and eloquent speaker. He is using his persuasive tongue to win the sympathy of Americans because the Philippines urgently needs economic assistance. Like most savvy Filipinos, he understands the psychology of Americans who like to be flattered. He has received American-style education in the country and has been engaged in American-style politics for more than 20 years. Therefore, he is accustomed to American life. He is at ease in the U.S. Senate or House of Representatives, and most congressmen are familiar with him.

Roxas's election foreshadows the arrival of a more progressive and enlightened policy in domestic affairs. In international affairs, in addition to maintaining close friendly relations with the United States, he also hopes to form alliances with China, Siam, France, and the Soviet Union to consolidate its international status. In terms of the global situation, a powerful member will be added to the United Front. In terms of the situation of the United States in the East, it has gained a new ally. The world and the United States should make every effort to help the Philippines consolidate its independence and increase its prosperity. This is very obvious.

### New Dutch Cabinet Established - Prime Minister Beel Concurrently Serves as Minister of Interior - A Compromise Policy Will Be Adopted Toward Indonesia

[Reuters, The Hague, 3rd] The new Dutch cabinet was sworn in before Queen Wilhelmina today. The new cabinet is composed of a mixture of the Catholic Party, the Labor Party, and non-party figures. The list is as follows: Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Beel (Catholic Party), Foreign Minister Oostergo (non-party), Minister of Justice Maalseven (Catholic Party), Minister of Education Gielen (Catholic Party), Minister of Finance Lieftinck (Labor Party), Minister of Army and Navy Vefferch (Catholic Party), Minister of Engineering Linjares (non-party), Minister of Transport Voss (Labor Party), Minister of Economic Affairs Schusman (Catholic Party), Minister of Agriculture and Food Mansholt (Labor Party), Minister of Social Welfare Tris (Labor Party), Minister of Overseas Affairs Jockman (non-party), Minister without Portfolio Klyvens (non-party).

The formation of this new cabinet has been delayed because the Labor Party demanded that progressive social policies be implemented and that Indonesia be granted autonomy, all of which must have full guarantees.

[United Press, The Hague, 2nd] The new Dutch Prime Minister Beel intends to appoint former Prime Minister Schermerhorn as the High Commissioner to Indonesia to implement the lenient policies of the previous Labor government. Schermerhorn will take office in Batavia, and his authority will exceed that of Acting Governor-General van Mook. According to reliable sources, this matter may be decided by the cabinet tomorrow.

[Reuters, Batavia, 2nd] Indonesian Prime Minister Shariel, who escaped yesterday, announced today that he will go to Yogyakarta, the headquarters of the Indonesian government in central Java, to discuss strong measures to deal with extremists and complete the work of forming a cabinet. It is also learned that Indonesian President Sukarno will meet with leaders of Indonesian political and patriotic groups tomorrow. The people who were kidnapped with Shariel have not yet been rescued, but their whereabouts are clear. Sukarno has ordered their immediate release.

### Atomic Energy Commission

Dispute Arises Over Voting Rules

[Report from this newspaper] London, 3rd Radio Broadcast: The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission convened a meeting today to resolve the issue of voting rules. Eleven of the twelve representatives agreed that a majority vote of seven countries would be sufficient to pass a resolution, but the Soviet Union insisted on a number of eight countries.

### Four Foreign Ministers Meeting - New Differences Arise Over the Management of Trieste

[Report from this newspaper] London, 3rd Radio Broadcast: Although new differences arose between the Soviet Union and Western countries today regarding the issue of the right to manage Trieste, it is generally believed that a compromise can be reached in the end and a peace conference can be convened this summer.

### The Siamese Government Announced Yesterday That It Has Entered a State of Emergency

[United Press, Bangkok, 3rd] The Siamese government announced a state of emergency today. The police are carrying out widespread newspaper censorship. It is reported that several local newspapers will be ordered to cease publication. However, the government did not explain the reason for declaring a state of emergency.

### Moscow Announces That National Prices Have Been Reduced by 40% - Amidst the U.S. Repeal of Price Controls - No Less Than Throwing an "Economic Bomb"

[United Press, San Francisco, 2nd] The atomic bomb test on Bikini Atoll has just been completed, and the Soviet Union has also dropped an economic bomb. Whether it is intentional or not is unknown. According to Moscow's announcement, the market prices of industrial manufactured goods across the country have been reduced by 40%. The United Press believes that since U.S. price controls have disappeared with the end of the Price Administration, this measure may attract significant attention in the United States. The move to actually lower prices has been brewing in the Soviet Union for a long time. The Soviet people undoubtedly believe that it will become a reality. However, there is now a question of how much Soviet prices have actually been reduced in terms of individual purchasing power. According to recent news from Moscow, the true purchasing power of the Soviet people does not lie in how much money they have in their hands, but in how many ration coupons they have for consumption. Rationing varies according to each person's job. It is very cheap to buy rationed goods from stores. Although the amount of rations received by the general public is not enough to make life too comfortable, they can be assured of food and clothing. If they have surplus funds, they can buy goods at special stores, but the goods on display there are not rationed and are very expensive. The Soviet Union's 40% price reduction this time refers to the goods in these special stores. We can therefore know that Soviet people who previously had surplus funds to buy luxury goods and extra supplies will have a more comfortable life in the future. Those who were previously unable to buy luxury goods can now also have their wishes fulfilled. The Soviet Union took measures to reduce prices immediately after the end of U.S. price controls. This timing may not be accidental.

### Okada's Absurd Testimony is Refuted by the United States

[Kaizo Publishing, Tokyo, 3rd] Former Prime Minister Keisuke Okada stated yesterday while testifying at the International Court that: "I heard that the United States had a tacit understanding of Japan's advance into Manchuria." A U.S. State Department spokesman immediately denied this, calling it nonsense.

[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] Okada provided false testimony at the International Court yesterday, stating that U.S. restrictions on immigration forced Japan, with its surplus population, to develop towards Manchuria. Okada claimed that there was a gentleman's agreement between the United States and Japan, recognizing Japan's continental expansion policy. This clearly refers to the Lansing-Ishii Agreement of November 1917. At that time, U.S. Secretary of State Lansing had a letter stating: "The governments of the United States and Japan recognize that territorial proximity creates special relationships between countries. Therefore, the U.S. government recognizes that Japan has special interests in China, especially in parts of China contiguous to its territory." Okada pointed out that this was a signal to Japan to expand to Manchuria. However, the Lansing-Ishii Agreement also bound both parties to respect China's sovereignty and the Open Door Policy. When the International Court continued its trial today, Tojo's lawyer Kiyose also said that Japanese immigration to Manchuria and Korea was influenced by U.S. immigration restrictions, which became one of the causes of the Pacific War. Chief Judge Webb said: "We do not pay attention to immigration, but only want to question the war." Kiyose replied: "Japanese colonization of Manchuria and Korea was one of the causes of the war."

### Far Eastern Commission Passes Principles of the New Japanese Constitution

Content Kept Secret

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] The Far Eastern Commission unanimously passed the fundamental principles of the new Japanese constitution today in order to establish a democratic government in Japan. The resolution has been sent to MacArthur for comparison with the new constitution submitted to the Diet by Emperor Hirohito earlier this year. However, the representatives of the Far Eastern Commission are unwilling to reveal the content of the resolution and have agreed to keep it secret pending consultation with MacArthur. However, it is reported that conditions are attached, hoping to be included in the new constitution.

### US Navy Announces Plan: Constructing a Grand Defensive Network, Bases Spanning Both Oceans and Across the Equator, Eliminating the Need for Island Hopping Tactics Thereafter

[United Press Washington, 2nd dispatch] The US Navy is completing a post-war major base system to consolidate the defense of the United States and the Western Hemisphere. This base system spans the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and extends north and south of the equator, including submarine and naval air facilities. In the event of war, it will eliminate the need for island-hopping tactics, avoiding unnecessary troop losses. Once this grand defensive system is established, it will make a great contribution to maintaining lasting world peace. Details of the plan are as follows:

Atlantic bases will include Antigua and St. Lucia in the British West Indies, Argentia in northern Newfoundland, and Great Exuma Island in the British Bahamas near the southwest coast of Florida. In the Pacific, the system will stretch from the Aleutian Islands to the Philippines, Australia, Palmyra Island (a US territory), and back to Honolulu. Within this vast triangle, the US Navy will fortify previously overlooked islands such as Eniwetok, Majuro, Kwajalein, Ryukyu, and Manus Island.

Two Ocean Bases Linked Together

A total of thirty-nine locations in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans will be linked in this vast plan. However, many are under foreign administration, requiring prior agreement before construction can proceed. Manus Island, located a few miles north of New Guinea, has long been overlooked. It is about 4,000 miles from Honolulu, and few Caucasians have seen it. However, it plays a significant role in the US plan to defeat Japan, which has brought it prominence. The island is not large but has a natural harbor capable of accommodating at least a thousand ships. The US Navy built a major operational base there during the war. Manus Island was originally part of German New Guinea in the Pacific. After World War I, the League of Nations entrusted Australia with its administration.

Manus Island: Important Stronghold

The US Navy calls Manus Island an indispensable stronghold in its Pacific defense plan. However, Australia is still hesitant to grant the US Navy the necessary privileges. The reasons for this hesitation remain to be explained in detail. The US State Department and the Australian Department of External Affairs are discussing the matter, and the US Navy is confident that permission will be granted once negotiations are complete. In addition, the US Navy plans to build air bases on islands scattered within 1,800 miles southwest of Pearl Harbor, such as Johnston, Palmyra, and Canton Islands. Both the United States and Great Britain claim sovereignty over these islands, but it should not be difficult to reach an agreement for base construction. In the Central Pacific, there are eight Japanese mandated territories, now under US control, where naval air bases will be established. The US Navy will also construct secondary operational bases in Adak in the Aleutian Islands and in the Philippines. Adak belongs to the United States, and negotiations are underway regarding the Philippines.

Using Taiwan: Requires Prior Negotiation

Guam and Saipan are another important point in the Pacific defense system. Located about 1,500 miles south of Japan, they are the westernmost operational bases of the United States and are currently under construction. Ryukyu, only a few hundred miles from mainland Japan, will also have an operational base established there after being captured by the US Navy. The US Seventh Fleet is currently stationed in Chinese waters, but this is temporary. The US Navy has no permanent facilities along the Chinese coast. Taiwan could become a port of call for the US fleet, but this requires prior negotiation with China. The US Twelfth Fleet is stationed in Japan to support General MacArthur and his occupation forces. Its stay will depend on needs, but Japan is not included in the US Navy's Pacific defense plan.

West Indies Defense Deployment

The main defensive network in the Atlantic is the Caribbean region. The US Navy hopes to construct facilities on Great Exuma Island in the Bahamas, as well as Jamaica, Antigua, St. Lucia, British Guiana, and Trinidad in the British West Indies. All of these islands are under the British flag. The Caribbean region also includes Guantanamo, belonging to Cuba; San Juan and Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico; St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands; Coco Solo at the eastern end of the Panama Canal; and Balboa on the Pacific side of the Canal Zone. In the North Atlantic, the US Navy plans to build facilities in Iceland and Greenland, the latter currently owned by Denmark. Besides obtaining the necessary bases and constructing facilities, the main challenge for the US Navy is securing the manpower needed for occupation and maintenance. As for ships, there are ample resources to meet the needs of this two-ocean defense plan.

### Soviet Research Institute Develops New Radar Optical Device

[Reuters Moscow, 2nd dispatch] TASS announced today that a certain Soviet experimental research institute has successfully tested the world's smallest machine, a radar optical device with a small aperture, only one four-thousandth of a [unit of measurement, likely an inch].

### Conclusions on the Power of the Atomic Bomb: US Navy Secretary Says Navy Can Still Be Preserved; Admiral Cunningham Holds the Same View

Second Test to Be Held on the 22nd

[Reuters Bikini Atoll, 2nd dispatch] US Navy Secretary Forrestal announced today after inspecting the damaged ships that two conclusions can be drawn from this atomic bomb test: (1) Heavily armored battleships are still not easy to sink unless their underwater parts are also damaged. (2) The status of the Navy can still be preserved. The most surprising result of this test is that battleships suffered the least damage. Two goats on the battleship "Pennsylvania" are still alive and well, grazing on the ship. However, experts predict that the two goats will succumb to the pressure of the waves. It is learned that all seventy-three target ships sustained varying degrees of damage. Lightweight equipment on the deck, such as radar and nets, was severely damaged.

[Reuters London, 2nd dispatch] Admiral Cunningham, Chief of Naval Staff, told the press association today that regardless of the existence of the atomic bomb, the British Navy still believes that sea power is the decisive force in war. The atomic bomb may have a destructive effect on battleships berthed in fixed locations at sea, but such effects would never occur in actual combat.

[Agence France-Presse dispatch] The second atomic bomb test will be held on the 22nd, with the bomb detonating 25 feet underwater. According to Commander Blandy, the warships that were not sunk in the first test will be turned into islands at that time.

### Zionist Movement: US Promises Assistance

[Agence France-Presse Washington, 2nd dispatch] A presidential spokesman said that President Truman, when receiving the American representatives of the Zionist movement committee today, expressed regret over the recent developments in Palestine. The President was informed that the British government did not consult with him before raiding the Jerusalem Zionist Committee headquarters. He will do his best to assist 100,000 Jews in moving to Palestine, and the United States is prepared to bear various technical and economic responsibilities in transporting the immigrants. He hopes that the detained Jewish leaders will be released and that order will be restored to its original state.

[Reuters Jerusalem, 2nd dispatch] It is learned that Hayfa Jewish leader, Dav Hai, who was arrested on Saturday, has been released.

Detained Jews Suffered Torture

[United Press London, 2nd dispatch] The Palestinian Jewish Congress today accused the Palestinian police of torturing detained Jews, causing severe injuries and possibly permanent disabilities to many. Some were even subjected to humiliation, having their genitals pulled, and being forced to hold stones under their armpits for hours.

### President Song Convenes Leaders of the Shipping Industry to Discuss Ways to Protect Maritime Rights; Accepts Seven Urgent Recommendations from Attending Representatives; Order to Open Coastal Ports Will Be Rescinded Immediately

Yesterday at 5:00 PM, President of the Executive Yuan, Mr. Song Ziwen, consulted with leaders of the shipping industry, including Du [name], Qian Yongming, Yang Jinbei, Li Yunliang, and Huang Haoyun, about the recent situation of the shipping industry and discussed genuine ways to protect maritime rights and develop the shipping industry in the future. The representatives detailed various difficulties and sufferings encountered by the shipping industry in our country, based on facts, especially emphasizing the crisis of foreign merchants infringing on maritime rights, and suggested the following urgent measures:

(1) Revoke the original proposal to open the four ports of the Yangtze River for inland navigation rights. To save on transshipment costs, it can be stipulated that ships purchased by our country from the United States will preferentially transport materials to the ports of the Yangtze River. Moreover, among the surplus ships in the United States, there are many suitable for ocean navigation. Our country can take this opportunity to open up ocean routes, without attracting foreign ships to the Yangtze River, which would affect maritime rights. (2) Cancel the contract for the Executive Yuan to lease British ships. This contract expires on the 16th of this month. For the past six months, British ships have been transporting large quantities of commercial goods under the guise of transporting relief supplies, which has led to many abuses. Currently, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has thirty-nine seagoing ships, totaling 140,000 tons. Relief supplies have averaged 22,390 tons per month for the past six months. Even if this figure is doubled or tripled, it is still not much. There is definitely no need to continue leasing foreign ships. (3) Cancel the order to open coastal ports. According to the announcement by the Jianghai Customs, "The General Taxation Department has forwarded the telegram from the Ministry of Finance No. 22828, which stated that the Executive Yuan has ordered that the transportation of goods and passengers between ports in China is limited to Chinese ships. Foreign merchant ships employed by government agencies, for the purpose of post-war relief, may temporarily travel between ports to transport goods and passengers until March 31, 1947. This is hereby announced." The previous order led to many abuses. On June 24, the British Ocean Steam Ship Company's Newchwang vessel, under the guise of transporting 200 tons of flour, carried 2,500 tons of commercial goods, with freight amounting to hundreds of millions of yuan, which is sufficient evidence. This order should be expressly canceled to protect maritime rights and prevent abuses. (4) Assist in the purchase of British shipping assets in China. According to the provisions of the Equal Treaty, Great Britain has given up its rights to inland and coastal navigation in China. The Chinese government is prepared to purchase its existing shipping assets at a fair price. Currently, Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire, are attempting to continue manipulating our country's maritime rights under the guise of being registered as Chinese companies. The government should promptly negotiate with the British side to transfer the wharves, warehouses, and ships along the Yangtze River and the sea. If these foreign firms register companies with Chinese-British joint ventures with our government, the government should verify whether Chinese shares actually account for more than two-thirds, in compliance with Article 3 of the Maritime Law, to prevent concealment. (5) Assist shipping companies in purchasing ships. Chinese shipping companies sacrificed 300,000 tons of ships in this war and urgently need relief and support. The US Congress has passed a bill to sell surplus ships, with the price calculated at a percentage of the original construction cost. The first payment is 25 percent, and the remaining amount is paid in installments over 20 years. We implore the government to purchase a large number of ships suitable for our country's waterways from the United States and transfer them to private shipping companies under the original conditions. (6) Reorganize the Shanghai port administration. Please establish a Shanghai Port Authority, referring to the Qingdao port administration regulations, to reorganize and construct Shanghai's warehouses and wharves, or establish a Shanghai Wharf and Warehouse Company to actively operate them. And clearly declare Shanghai as a major port in the East, to replace the original plan to build a major port in Zhapu in the industrial plan, and to expedite the opening of existing wharves and warehouses. (7) Determine shipping policy. Although our country's shipping policy was repeatedly discussed and agreed upon by a small group meeting convened by the Supreme National Defense Council before the end of the war, it has not yet been announced. Since the restoration, the domestic shipping industry urgently needs to be established, especially with the active support of the government to meet transportation needs. The government should promptly make a decision and formulate laws to maintain maritime rights for a long time. After listening to the representatives' opinions, Mr. Song expressed that most of them could be accepted. However, regarding the cancellation of the order to open coastal ports and the Executive Yuan's lease contract, they can be implemented immediately. A policy to establish and support private shipping companies will also be announced in the shortest possible time.

### Major Embezzlement Case in Two Roads Bureaus: More Than 30 Million Yuan Recovered; Seventeen Male and Female Staff Members Referred to the District Procuratorate Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] The embezzlement case of 12,170,000 yuan that occurred in the Materials Department of the Two Roads Administration Bureau.

### Director of the Health Bureau Is Anxious; The Time Epidemic Hospital Uses 800 Pounds of Salt Water Daily; Cholera Prevention Is Very Easy: Do Not Eat Raw Cold Dishes, Eat Cooked Dishes

With a sad mood, the reporter reports to all sectors the experience of visiting the Shanghai Time Epidemic Hospital, to tell readers that the spread of cholera has entered an unrestrained stage!

There are a total of nine time epidemic hospitals in Shanghai now, but none of them do not declare "full"! The gate of the Shanghai Time Epidemic Hospital is hung with a sign that reads "The wards of this hospital are full, there are no empty beds", but there are still many people coming to the hospital in tricycles, rickshaws, and rattan chairs with patients, and their families are surrounding them, busy rubbing the cramping limbs of the patient, while begging the hospital authorities bitterly, but the answer of the person in charge is: "Hospitalization is absolutely impossible, we can only give you a life-saving injection, and if it is not good, please carry it home, if it is not good, come back for another injection".

This is not the cruelty of the hospital, seeing death without saving, but it is really "powerless", now the corridors and patios of the hospital have become temporary wards, there is no space to accommodate patients, about four or five people are discharged from the hospital after treatment every morning, but in less than two hours, it will be filled again! The later people can only "be beaten back". The working atmosphere in the hospital is now extremely tense, all facilities are working day and night, the average doctor works eight hours a day, the nurse works twelve hours, the busy situation of sweating and sweating is definitely not under the war hospital.

According to the dean of the hospital, Na Qingshan, the spread of cholera has also spread to the middle and upper classes, and there are patients from the education, banking, and money shops in these days, and once a banker's wife stayed in the corridor overnight because there was no room.

The hospital is equipped with a hunger injection room, and all those who need to be injected with salt water are carried into the room by the ward for injection. Most patients continue to diarrhea while injecting salt water. People with cholera, after diarrhea, the stool is pure clear water, after injecting a large amount of salt water, the diarrhea can be stopped, the hospital's salt water is self-prepared, an average of 800 pounds per day.

According to Dean Deng: In the hospital's past experience, the oldest was seventy-seven years old, and the youngest was eight days. Originally, there was a child who was born prematurely, this child was not born at the right time, on the eighth day, unfortunately, the mother was infected with cholera, an eight-day-old baby, must taste the taste of salt water, but fortunately, the mother and child are safe. Finally, Dean Deng told reporters that cholera is not impossible to prevent, and cholera bacteria are very easy to die, as long as you do not drink raw water on weekdays, cook the vegetables, soak the melon in boiling water, you can ensure safety.

After the reporter left the Shanghai Time Epidemic Hospital, I felt that the situation was really too serious, so I rushed to the Municipal Health Bureau to visit Director Zhang Wei. According to Director Zhang, in order to the severity of the epidemic, he has been unable to sleep peacefully for many days, and he can't wait to have a few more hours in a day so that the people of the Health Bureau can step up their work.

UN Relief to Fly in Medicine

[United Press Washington, 2nd dispatch] UNRRA Director LaGuardia announced today that UNRRA plans to fly urgently needed medicines and equipment worth 30,000 yuan to Shanghai to combat cholera. The airborne drugs will be shipped from San Francisco to Shanghai. Air transport takes only six days, while shipping takes about three weeks.

Be More Careful After the Rain

Yesterday's heavy rain caused flooding in low-lying areas, with waterlogging, and sewers clogged. Cholera bacteria spread extremely quickly. I hope that citizens will pay extra attention. Yesterday, there were sixty-eight patients with cholera and seven deaths. Including the previous cases, there were a total of 1,034 patients and eighty-one deaths, including three Soviet nationals and one Australian national.

### Spectacle of Heavy Rain: Boats on Land, American Soldiers Having Fun, Rickshaws Thriving Threefold; Shanghai Estimated to Be One-Third Submerged

[Report from Our Newspaper] It is said that these past two days of heavy rain are due to the effects of atomic bombs. Meteorologists are divided into two factions, some acknowledging it and others denying it. We don't know the truth, but at least this heavy rain is unprecedented in recent years, which is a fact. According to yesterday's report by Director Zheng Zizheng of the Weather Bureau, yesterday's rainfall totaled 97 millimeters, equivalent to about 3.9 inches. "Such heavy rain should stop today," Director Zheng said.

Welcoming the flood are children, who play in the water, causing adults to groan incessantly. In the western part of Shanghai, from Avenue Joffre to Route Albert, including Yu Garden Road, Route Dufour, Route Haig, Route Tenant de la Tour, Route de Grosse-Grosse, and others, are all flooded. Tall buildings such as Hua Apartment, the International Hotel, and Wing On Company all look like they are built on islands. Trams have stopped running, and red buses carry heavier loads than usual, shuttling back and forth on roads without standing water. Rickshaws and cycle rickshaws are enjoying a hundredfold increase in business. One crossing costs five hundred or a thousand [dollars], and for longer distances, the fare exceeds the cost of a business trip by car. In the deep-water areas of the Western District, American soldiers are floating around in rubber rafts. To them, land sailing must seem like a miracle. Many cars are helping to push vehicles stuck in the water, earning some extra money. Water has flooded the sidewalks, and shop assistants are taking a leisurely break, simply closing their doors.

The plaza of the Social Affairs Bureau on Avenue Joffre has become a large pool. On Rue Massenet, a child of about ten years old fell into the water and took the opportunity to swim. The water is above the knee, and even long boots are useless. After sewage seeped into the long boots, the reporter took a rickshaw back. About one-third of the entire Shanghai area is submerged in water.

According to meteorologists, Shanghai is experiencing a period of prolonged rainfall. After this, there will likely be twenty more days of rain. Boots and raincoats are once again in demand.

### "A Shower on the Third Day of the Sixth Lunar Month: Plowing Rice in the Morning, Sleeping in the Afternoon" More Flooding Expected This Month; Director Zhao Greets Reporters After the Rain, Reports on Inspection of Flooded Areas

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to the Shanghai Yearbook of 1935, the average rainfall in July is 150.4 centimeters, with a record high of 369.5 centimeters. Also, according to the Zikawei Observatory, the rainfall on March 27 of this year reached 65 centimeters, the highest in fifteen years. According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works, the rainfall from 9 AM the day before yesterday to 9 AM yesterday reached 90 centimeters (3.5 inches), exceeding the March 27 rainfall by slightly less than one-third.

Zhao Zukang, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, personally inspected the post-rain conditions in various districts from early yesterday morning to the afternoon. The most severe flooding was in areas around Central Lin Sen Road, South Mau Ming Road, East Si Nan Road, North Tian Tong Road, Chekiang Road, Fan Yu Road, Jiao Zhou Road, Kang Ding Road, and the eastern section of Yu Garden Road. Director Zhao specifically met with reporters from various newspapers at 4:30 PM yesterday to report on the causes of the flooding: (1) Excessive rainfall, coinciding with high tide. The water level reached a maximum of 12.1 feet above the surface at 3:04 AM yesterday, and a maximum of 10.65 feet at 3:39 PM in the afternoon. Low-lying roads are generally 10 to 11 feet above the water surface. Director Zhao also said: "As the saying goes, 'A shower on the third day of the sixth lunar month: Plowing rice in the morning, sleeping in the afternoon.' More flooding is expected this month." (2) Small water pipes, making drainage difficult. There are currently seven pumping stations, including the stations on Macgregor Road, Foochow Road, Fukien Road, Tientsin Road, Chefoo Road, Nanking Road, Szechuen Road, Woosung Road, North Szechuen Road, Chapoo Road, East Chung Cheng Road Bund, Foochow Road Bund and Bazih Road Bund, with the Macgregor Road station being the largest. Each station started pumping water at 3 AM yesterday, so the water on Avenue Edward VII and Rue Molière has receded slightly, but Kang Ding Road is not showing results because the diameter of the pipe is only twelve [inches]. (3) The dredging work is incomplete. The bureau's dredging of the Laohua Creek will be completed in two weeks, and the Zhaojia Creek will be completed by the end of the month. Currently, dams are being built and mud is being dredged, so the water flow is obstructed. This was dismantled yesterday morning. At the same time, the sewer grates are clogged with garbage and have not been cleaned in eight years, making it difficult to clear them.

### Crackdown on Obscene Publications to Continue

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Police Bureau has decided to severely crack down on publications that promote indecency and piracy in the city. Last week, they confiscated all eight types of books, including "The Flirtatious Widow" and "The Sister-in-Law in the Family." In addition, thirty-three types of obscene publications that were not registered with the Central Propaganda Department were also banned from sale, and the Booksellers Association was notified not to handle their distribution.

### American Independence Day in Shanghai: Memories of Today Nine Years Ago

Before the War of Resistance, every year on July 4th, American officials and civilians in Shanghai would celebrate this glorious anniversary. Especially in 1937, two days before the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident, the celebration was the most enthusiastic. Newspaper reports at the time described it as "three days of revelry" because July 4th that year happened to fall on a Sunday, so they started from the 3rd and continued until the 5th. It might be interesting to compare the schedule of those three days with today's first anniversary after the victory:

July 3rd: 3:30 PM, horse races and basketball games. 9:00 PM, officials and civilians gathered at the Columbia Country Club to watch fireworks and hold a grand ball. The American machine gun squad of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps chartered a ferry for a night cruise on the Huangpu River.

July 4th: 10:00 AM, the U.S. Marine Corps held a large-scale service at the Cathay Theater. U.S. Consul General Hillel McCormick gave a speech on the history of American construction, and there was instrumental music and the national anthem.

July 5th: All U.S. agencies were closed to celebrate. 8:00 AM, flag-raising and military parade at the racecourse. 12:00 PM, a grand tea party was held at the Columbia Country Club for Chinese and foreign officials. Mayor Yu Hongjun, Commander Yang [blank], and consuls from various countries attended, with no fewer than four hundred people in attendance. There was a race at the racecourse.

Seeing the above record, one cannot help but feel a sense of "what a grand occasion!" That revelry did seem to have some "foresight" because before long, the flames of war in China spread from the north throughout the country. From 1938 onwards, because we were in the midst of great difficulty, U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson issued an order to officials and civilians in various regions not to celebrate excessively, so the July 4th holidays in the following years were spent quietly. After the Japanese occupied the concessions, under the slogan of anti-British and anti-Americanism, American officials and civilians had to spend their bleak years in concentration camps.

Time has overturned everything, and time has also restored everything to the "USA" era. The first July 4th after the victory has arrived. The U.S. celebration program has already been published in detail in yesterday's newspaper. However, due to the sudden rain, outdoor activities will be moved to the 7th.

Seeing the revelry of other countries' national days, and looking back at our own devastated land, every Chinese person cannot help but feel a little sad. But considering President Thomas Jefferson's brilliant declaration of "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," we can once again be given unlimited encouragement today! (Feihong)

### Philippine Independence Celebration

[Report from Our Newspaper] The four hundred-plus Filipino residents of this city will hold a grand celebration today to celebrate Philippine Independence Day, as well as a tea party with people from all walks of life.

At the meeting, Mr. Luo Changge, Chairman of the Philippine Association, will deliver a speech entitled "The Meaning of Independence Day." U.S. Consul General Davis and Mayor Wu of this city will also attend and deliver congratulatory speeches. There will also be a social dance party afterwards.

[Another Report] The originally scheduled parade has been cancelled due to concerns that the standing water after yesterday's heavy rain has not receded.

### Xu Tieshan Is Not Worthy: His Old Age Is Dishonorable; Accused of Colluding with the Enemy and Betraying the Country; The High Procuratorate Files Public Prosecution

[Report from Our Newspaper] Xu Tieshan (?), a remnant from the Qing Dynasty, is a native of Yuyao, Zhejiang. He is 68 years old and lives at No. 53 Chonghua New Village on Jing'an Temple Road. In his early years, he traveled to Japan and studied at Tongwenguan and the Military Academy. He successively served as a First-Class Translator Officer in the President's Office and as a Prefect of Fengtian.

He was arrested, and the High Procuratorate filed a public prosecution against him on suspicion of being a traitor. In addition, the enemy puppet era "industrial and commercial leaders" Xie Xiaochu, Dai Yinchang, Jin Gengxin, Wang Bingsheng and other suspected traitors' cases have also been brought to public prosecution, and will be publicly tried in the High Court in the near future.

[Another Report] Jin Xiongbai, the president of the puppet "Ping Bao" newspaper, is scheduled to be interrogated for the first time by the High Court this morning.

### Zheng Hongnian's Case to Be Announced on the 9th

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zheng Hongnian, who once served as Vice Minister of Finance of the National Government, Director-General of Military Supplies of the Guangdong Military Government, Director of the Jingfeng Railway Bureau, and President of Jinan University, served as the president of the puppet China Central Railway Company after the outbreak of the Pacific War, compiling the railway transportation business in the Central China region and helping the enemy.

### Kang Yihang's Appeal in the New Asia Hotel Case Is Rejected

[Report from Our Newspaper] The famous New Asia Hotel in this city, located at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Tian Tong Road, was originally built on land leased from Zhang Danru. At the end of 1933, a contract was signed for a term of twenty years, stipulating that if the rent was not paid for two consecutive years, the owner could revoke the lease. During the "August 13th" Shanghai Incident, the hotel was occupied by the enemy for a long time, and the owner was also replaced by the Danish Kang Yihang. After the victory, Kang Yi, the legal representative of the bank, filed a lawsuit with the civil court of the Shanghai District Court against the legal representative of the Asia Hotel, claiming to revoke the surface rights based on the contract. The initial judgment was that Kang Yihang lost the case. The trial has ended, and yesterday morning the verdict was announced, rejecting the appeal, and the litigation costs were borne by the appellant.

### United Press Responds to Chen Guolian: Denies Malicious Defamation; Second Batch of Repatriated German侨 Sent to Concentration Camps

[United Press, July 3rd] Regarding the previous United Press report that Chinese officials had accepted bribes to change the list in the case of the evacuation of German residents from Shanghai, Chen Guolian, director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, sent a letter to the United Press on the 2nd, questioning that this was slander and insult to his office and demanding that he provide actual evidence and point out the names of people. The United Press replied to Chen on the 3rd, stating that the United Press's message did not specify who or which organization accepted the bribes, so there was no defamation of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as the bribe-takers may have been other parties. Moreover, it is investigating the truth about the evacuation of German residents, so what the agency reported cannot be described as malicious defamation.

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to statistics from the German Puppet Management Committee, there are a total of more than 2,100 German residents in this city. Among them, except for those who are temporarily ill (certified by Chinese and American doctors), those who have married foreigners and have dual nationality, those who have divorced Germans, and those who need to be interrogated because they are Nazi party members, will be repatriated to the country. Yesterday was the date for the second batch to be sent to concentration camps, totaling 463 people. Together with the day before yesterday, a total of 702 people will leave Shanghai on the 7th. According to the authorities of the association, the list of Nazi German residents listed by the association is completely consistent with the list investigated by the American side, so it is wrong to spread rumors that there are espionage cases.

### Egyptian Cotton Industry Delegation Arrives in Shanghai

### Real Estate Industry Association Demands: Revision of Rental Management Rules; Protection of the Property Rights of Legitimate Owners; Abolition of the Second-Hand Landlord System as Soon as Possible

[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, the housing shortage in this city has been serious, and rental disputes have arisen one after another. The Commercial Association of the Real Estate Industry in this city has, in view of this, recently petitioned the Municipal Government, requesting that the "Housing Rental Management Rules" be revised. The reasons are divided into three points: (1) The rules were based on the end of the war, and the item has been repealed. Moreover, the rules stipulate that the lease between the landlord and the tenant must be registered and reviewed, which is beyond the scope stipulated in the original rules. (2) Rental disputes have always been handled by the judicial organs. According to the Civil Procedure Law, housing disputes and other cases must first be mediated by the court. If mediation fails, a lawsuit can be filed. Now the rules also have provisions for mediation, which is not in line with the separation of judicial power. (3) The rules stipulate that all lease contracts must be registered with the committee and reviewed by it, and the amount of rent is repeatedly restricted, which inevitably infringes on the people's freedom to enter into contracts. At the same time, the association also reached the following points: (1) The sovereignty of the owner should be respected, and legitimate profits should be given. At present, the power to dispose of houses in this city is completely in the hands of the second landlord, and the legitimate owner has become a state of having property but no power, and the industry is not independent. Therefore, the sovereignty of the owner should be respected first, so that he has the right to defend himself from the illegal occupation of tenants. The current burden of the owner is extremely heavy, such as land donations, housing donations, deed tax, stamp tax, rental income tax, insurance premiums, and housing management fees, which are huge in number, and rental income often does not cover expenses, and many houses have not been repaired after the incident and are in danger of collapse. It seems that the expenditure should be reviewed in detail, and at least the industry should be preserved to avoid accompanying the accumulation. (2) The legitimate rights and interests of the original tenants should be protected, and the landlord or Luo Rent should not be allowed to have foreign languages, or to recover and sublet, etc., but at the same time, tenants should also be restricted from illegally occupying the owner's behavior, such as the current second landlord, arbitrarily subletting the owner's house and charging high rents, arbitrarily bidding to obtain the top fee, arbitrarily subletting, and mainly bearing unnecessary repair losses. (Should) Those who have not obtained housing should have the opportunity to rent a house. On the positive side, the property rights of legitimate owners should be protected, and reasonable rental standards should be stipulated, so that investors are happy to build new houses, and those who build new houses should also be rewarded. On the passive side, the second landlord system should be abolished as soon as possible, so that the three tenants can directly sign a lease with the owner, then all the disputes arising from the second landlord will naturally be reduced. (4) Contact should be established with the court and the affiliate to avoid the disadvantages of separation and divergence. If the rules are complicated and cannot be revised, it is better to abolish them immediately and listen to the people's freedom to make contracts, and the disputes will be handled by the judiciary, so as to avoid the government from having orders that are not followed, and the people from having the pain of being動　得咎.

### Revision of University Curriculum Standards – Ministry of Education Continuing Research

[Special Nanjing Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Education's revision of elementary school curriculum standards was mostly finalized at a meeting of experts held in Shanghai last month and will soon be implemented. The revision of secondary school curriculum standards was discussed at a meeting held by the Ministry of Education in Chongqing before the recovery. There is a plan, but the ministry will convene experts from various regions to discuss further once all schools have been restored. It is reported that the Ministry of Education is also continuously conducting research into the revision of university curriculum standards. The revision of the curriculum for the faculties of Arts, Sciences, Law, and Education has reached a significant stage. After the recovery, the curriculum for the faculties of Agriculture, Engineering, Commerce, and Medicine will also be revised in their entirety. The trend of the revision is to appropriately allocate the hours for compulsory courses, reduce the burden on students, reduce the hours for unnecessary subjects, and increase students' extracurricular activities to regulate their physical and mental development. Special attention is being paid to the curriculum for the first year of university. Considering that the level of high school graduates in the recovered areas does not fully meet the standards, all universities and independent colleges have now been ordered to establish university preparatory classes. This allows students who do not meet the standards or who were not admitted to university to pursue further studies in the preparatory classes. The new university curriculum standards should be raised accordingly. Students with weaker levels can connect with the new university curriculum standards through remedial classes in the preparatory classes. Therefore, the curriculum for the first year of university will be appropriately revised to avoid repetition and prevent waste. (Reporter's Note: During the period when Shanghai was occupied and had concessions, Jiangsu Provincial schools resumed classes in Shanghai, and some famous high schools in Shanghai often used textbooks that were at the level of the first semester of university in the final stage of high school English, Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry courses.)

### Student Unrest in Northern and Southern Jiangsu

Bengbu Vocational School Students Oppose Principal Yang - Accuse Principal of Corruption and Monitor Principal, Depriving Him of Freedom

Hangzhou Normal School Students Oppose Principal Zhu - Accuse Principal of Favoritism and Demand Dismissal by the Department of Education

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Bengbu] On the evening of June 27, students at the Anhui Provincial Industrial Vocational School requested that the school provide each student with several thousand yuan from the provincial subsidy for rice, food, and other expenses before the end of the semester in order to return home.

Organize a Committee to Settle Accounts with the Principal

Principal Yang Chengcheng did not agree. The students expressed their dissatisfaction and immediately organized a liquidation committee to settle accounts with the principal and monitor the actions of the principal and faculty members. On the 28th, they published the matter in the Wanbei Daily in the name of all the students, accusing Principal Yang of corruption, withholding internship fees, forcing students to subsidize teachers' meals, stealing and selling school bricks and stones, and forging the private seals of faculty members and students when handling reimbursements last semester. The school originally planned to hold a major exam but was unable to do so. That afternoon, Wang Zhongtian, an old provincial scholar in Bengbu, and Zhu Zhuoren, the chief of the education section of the municipal office, went to mediate but were unsuccessful. According to student representatives speaking to reporters: There are currently fewer than 150 students in the entire school, divided into one class in the textile department and two classes in the civil engineering department. Now that this matter has occurred, we hope that people from all walks of life will uphold justice and provide assistance. However, according to Principal Yang: This matter is indeed unfortunate for our school. Students are welcome to check the accounts, but I hope they will not escalate the situation. As of the 30th, the school gate was still being guarded by students. Many teachers have regained their freedom, but Principal Yang and the clerk are still being monitored and unable to exercise their duties. The faculty members hope for a peaceful resolution so that they can take a vacation and return home as soon as possible. (Chao)

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Hangzhou] Approximately 200 students at Hangzhou Normal School opposed Principal Zhu Wenzhi and demanded the expulsion of arsonist student Wu Changchong. They wrote and issued a declaration to the public and posted激烈的 slogans everywhere.

March in Formation - Petition the Provincial Government

At 8:30 AM on the 1st of this month, they marched in formation to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to petition. At that time, the provincial government auditorium was holding a memorial week. Secretary-General Lei received the student representatives on behalf of the government, informing them that it was not necessary to march in formation to petition. Subsequently, Section Chief Luo of the Department of Education inquired about the reasons from the students and advised them. The students accused Principal Zhu of neglecting school affairs and protecting student Wu Changchong, who had been absent from class and set fire. Finally, they proposed two demands: (1) to demand the dismissal of Principal Zhu, and (2) to expel student Wu Changchong. They then returned in formation. If the petition's purpose is not achieved, the students will not leave the school for a day. According to Li Bohong, the director of school affairs: This incident originated in April this year when students suspected that their classmate Wu Changchong was suffering from venereal disease and asked the school to expel him. However, after being diagnosed by Zheng Shuzheng, the school doctor, it was found that he did not have venereal disease but rather balanitis. However, Wu's behavior was usually inappropriate, so Principal Zhu did not expel him for the sake of cultivating talent since the semester was already halfway over. The students blamed the principal for this matter. After the arson incident occurred, they believed that it was Wu who did it and肆意 attacked Principal Zhu for allowing students to set fire. At that time, Wu was sent to court for questioning due to the arson case. As a result, there was no conclusive evidence, and he was ordered to post bail. Because he was in a foreign land and had no relatives, Shen Xi, the director of general affairs of the school, acted as his guarantor out of the relationship between teachers and students. Therefore, the students were even more dissatisfied.

### City Elementary School Principals Suggest to the Education Bureau - Levy Respect-for-Teachers Rice

And Levy School Building Construction Fees from Students

[City News] The council of the City Elementary School Principals Association held its third regular meeting at Fuchun Elementary School on Shaanxi Road last night. Chairman Chai Zifei presided over the meeting and resolved the following major cases: (1) In order to improve teachers' lives and stabilize teachers' work in the next semester, it is suggested that the Education Bureau levy respect-for-teachers rice from students in accordance with the Ministry's order. (2) The Ministry of Education stipulates that each school's office expenses account for 25% of the school's total funding, but the office expenses currently issued by the Education Bureau average only about one thirty-fifth of the total, making it difficult for each school to handle affairs. Please increase office expenses in the next semester. (3) In order to improve the quality of each school, school buildings, equipment, etc., do not meet the standards.

(Article 13) After the order of Baojia and households is determined, each household shall be issued a household tag made of wood or bamboo, clearly stating the Baojia number. Starting from the date of investigation, a population count shall be conducted for each household, and a household investigation form shall be filled out. The investigation of the entire area shall be completed within ten days from the date of investigation.

The household investigation form may be replaced by a household registration application, which is filled out by the investigators and still signed or sealed by the head of the investigated household or their representative.

The investigation of co-business households may only investigate the number of people actually residing there, while still reporting the total number. A registration application may be issued to the investigated household, instructing them to fill it out.

(Article 14) For household investigations, both permanent residents and current residents shall be investigated. Transient populations shall be recorded separately on another piece of paper during the investigation. Those with native residence currently residing, those who have moved out without changing their native residence, and those who have resided for one year and are eligible to establish temporary residence are considered permanent residents. The population within the investigated household on the investigation day is the current resident population. Those within the investigated household on the investigation day but who have resided for less than one month and have no fixed residence are considered transient populations.

For those who have moved out of their native residence as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the area and period of relocation shall be noted.

Foreigners residing within the country for diplomatic or representative missions may not be investigated.

(Article 15) The order in which co-living households fill out the household investigation form is as follows:

1.  Head of household

2.  Spouse of the head of household

3.  Direct ascendants of the head of household

4.  Direct descendants of the head of household and their spouses

5.  Collateral relatives of the head of household and their spouses

### Concerning the Registration of Foreign Companies: Five Opinions from the President of the American Chamber of Commerce; The Exact Number of American Businesses in Shanghai Cannot Yet Be Ascertained

[Report from Our Newspaper] Our reporter, in order to understand the opinions of foreign businesses regarding company registration, specifically visited Mr. Pan De, President of the American Chamber of Commerce in this city. He stated: Since the revised New Company Law was promulgated, most American businesses in this city are very willing to go to the authorities to handle registration procedures. During several meetings of the American Chamber of Commerce, the American businesses all expressed willingness to prepare for registration. However, during the preparation process, there are still some issues that are deemed worthy of study: (1) The registration steps seem to be too complicated. The registration procedures for American businesses in the United States are very simple. Furthermore, the credit information that must be filled out during registration is also more complex. Some credit information is deemed by the American businesses to be necessary to maintain its confidentiality in business, so it seems inappropriate to fill it out. (2) The collection of taxes and levies has no fixed standard. Currently, the largest expense for American businesses operating in Shanghai is employee salaries, followed by payable taxes and levies. The current tax system has no standards and is too complicated. Therefore, there is an urgent need to simplify the collection process. (3) The Sino-American Commercial Treaty has not yet been finalized. This treaty regulates the operation of commerce between China and the United States. Therefore, before the content of the treaty is clarified, businesses on both sides of China and the United States feel somewhat at a loss as to how to develop their future business. (4) American businesses operating in China have no special hopes. They are extremely willing to cooperate with all parties to promote trade between them. Therefore, it is hoped that the regulations of various laws in China will not be too strict, lest they prevent the development of normal business. He said: After the United States declared the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China in 1943, it re-signed the Sino-American Treaty of Friendship. This treaty stipulated that it was reciprocal in nature. However, recently, China stipulated that foreigners residing in the interior must still go to the police stations to complete endorsement procedures. However, Chinese residing in various places in the United States do not need to complete these endorsement procedures. This move also hinders the development of foreign businesses in China. (5) Some businesses operated by the government, or their agencies, tend to monopolize various undertakings after participating in them. For example, recently, the customs often temporarily restricts the import of certain imported goods. This makes foreign businesses feel extremely uncertain. Furthermore, the regulations of the Chamber of Commerce are also different between China and the United States. The Social Bureau stipulates that the Chamber of Commerce belongs to the nature of a public association. All members must bear considerable responsibility for the actions of any member. This is not the case in the United States. The American Chamber of Commerce is only an organization where representatives of several members meet. Mr. Pan then stated: American businesses do not currently hope to be given preferential conditions in law, but hope that all regulations will not discriminate against American businesses. In conclusion, he said: The above are only a few examples of the obvious ones. Mr. Pan did not want to complain about the difficult situation faced by foreign businesses. However, he said that if the relevant authorities consult, he will provide many constructive suggestions.

The reporter then inquired about the registration of American companies from Ms. Smith, the representative of the Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Advancement Association in China. She stated that since the revised New Company Law was promulgated, American businesses remaining in China have been preparing to handle registration procedures. Some have already registered with the Chinese Ministry of Economic Affairs. It is estimated that before the Pacific War, there were about one hundred American businesses in Shanghai. Since Japan's surrender, some American businesses have come to Shanghai to resume operations, while others have closed down and returned to their countries due to the temporary inability to develop their businesses. Therefore, the exact number of American businesses in Shanghai is currently being investigated and counted.

According to the original text: The Social Bureau stipulates that members of the Chamber of Commerce must bear considerable responsibility for the actions of any member, which is not the case in the United States. As far as we know, the Social Bureau has no such regulations, nor are there such regulations in central laws. It has been heard that British and American merchants have filed a complaint with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about this matter. It is unknown how this misunderstanding arose.

### Extremely Tight Money Supply, High Interest Rates; Gold Prices Forced to Fall; US Dollars and Hong Kong Dollars Also Feel Weak

Yesterday, Shachi first hung up high the decorated gold of small silver shops from the day before, opening in the morning at 2.02 million, but it was only a flash in the pan.

The US exchange rate was nominally stable but actually sluggish.

### Central Bank Discussing Measures to Prevent the Abuse of Bad Checks

Since the disastrous fall in the government bond market, most speculators have collapsed and have had to resort to fraudulent behavior by issuing bad checks. Recently, similar cases have been appearing frequently, causing great panic in the financial markets of Beijing and Shanghai. The Central Bank is making every effort to prevent this in order to stabilize the financial market. It is heard that it has been consulting with the responsible departments of the Ministry of Finance on concrete measures to restrict this practice. In the future, discounting bills will be handled according to the Negotiable Instruments Law to prevent bad checks from entering the market.

### Applications for Export Goods Styles are Subject to Extremely Strict Review

The Bank of China, due to the decline in the verification industry after the war, has specially launched export goods loans, and especially encourages manufacturers holding import certificates from overseas countries by providing them with low-interest loans. It is heard that since the above news was revealed, many people have been actively applying. In order to ensure that the loans are used for legitimate purposes, the bank conducts a detailed review of the above loan applicants in advance, and conducts investigations at any time afterward.

### Government Bonds are Flat

Government prices are extremely stable. There are still a few buyers who are curious to buy at low prices, and shorts are also covering, but transactions are still mostly scattered. Unified bonds (Type C) only fluctuated by 30 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous closing, it showed a slight increase. Types A, B, D, and E also rebounded slightly.

### Ripple Effect of Late Month's End; Bulls Dump Holdings; Both Chinese and Foreign Stocks Plummet

Chinese stocks were forced to cut long positions due to the urgent financial turmoil. Except for Mei Ya, which managed to stabilize after falling too severely to a low of 2,400 yuan, all other stocks closed at lower prices. Unpopular small and medium-sized stocks were also dragged down. Only Sino-French maintained, and the decline was limited. After weakening at noon, the market stabilized. As a result, compared with the previous closing, the five popular stocks such as Yongsha fell by about 20%, while the unpopular small and medium-sized stocks, except for Sino-French, which fell slightly, fell by about 10%. Veteran stocks were also dragged down slightly.

Foreign stocks were also caught in the whirlpool. All stocks were surrounded by cuts. Ewo Silk fell sharply by 1,100 yuan as soon as the market opened, falling to 8,600 yuan. After the opening, it continued to show weakness. However, more stocks maintained lower prices. The market closed at noon. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Ewo Silk and Paper fell by 15%, while British Associated Industries, Kwang Ewo Brewery fell by 10%, Jardine Matheson fell by slightly less than 10%, and the decline of Asian Steel was limited.

Among them, there are 28 motion picture importers, 27 coal oil importers, 73 automobile importers, 11 sugar importers, and 52 tobacco importers.

### Price of Quanzhou Dried Longans Rises

It is heard that the new sprouts of Quanzhou longans are very scarce this year, and the output of this season is expected to be poor. Therefore, the price of old stock has risen instead. Recently, it has risen by 230,000 yuan, causing the opening price in Shanghai to tighten accordingly.

### Bank Profits are High for the First Half of the Year

[Report from Our Newspaper] Financial news: The settlements of Shanghai banks for the first half of this year have been completed. Commercial banks have all made profits. The highest profit amount has reached more than 500 million yuan, and the lowest is also around 50 million yuan. The reason why each bank has made a profit is mostly due to speculation, so it cannot determine the future of the Shanghai financial market.

### Money Supply Tightens, Gold Prices Rebound Slightly, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Fall Simultaneously

Yesterday, the yarn market suddenly turned downstream. The money supply in the financial community tightened, and gold prices fell back into the 2 million range. Yarn prices also plummeted as a result. As soon as the market opened in the morning, there were many sellers and few buyers. Dealers were eager to sell, and prices gradually fell. Double Horse and 42-count double-ply yarn fell the most, about 100,000 yuan lower than before the end of last month. The remaining 20-count small and medium-sized yarns fell by about 340,000 yuan. At noon, Fang Jian opened yarn as usual, and the price also depreciated with the market.

Current cotton transactions in this port were flat. Because the prices of US cotton and yarn both fell, manufacturers and cotton prices were hesitant to wait and see. Only Nantong Dasheng Yarn Factory entered Pengjiapo for 400 bales, priced at 95,000 to 98,000. In addition, other factories have not made purchases.

Due to the tight money supply and rumors that several banks were stranded, the cloth market was greatly disheartened. Many buyers were eager to sell, and at the same time, the road water overflowed. There were few people gathering in the market, and transactions were very light. The leading Longtou thread was exhausted at 250 yuan, but the general grabbing threads were sold and settled, falling by 750 yuan, and then stabilized in the afternoon.

### Grain Price Review Committee to be Formally Established This Week; Responsible for Assessing Rice Prices in the City

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the Fourth Grain Conference decided to organize a Grain Price Review Committee, it has been stipulated that the Social Bureau, the bean and rice industry, and rice businesses each send two representatives, and the general warehouse of the Grain Department and the rice grain business each send one representative to participate in the organization, which is presided over by the Social Bureau. It is understood that the organizational regulations of the association will be drafted within one or two days at the latest, and the association is also expected to be formally established within this week. After the association is established, it will refer to the rice prices in various production areas and the various expenses that grain merchants should pay when purchasing grain in Shanghai, plus the legal profits of grain merchants, and then assess a fair price to encourage rice merchants to automatically purchase rice and grain in various production areas and come to Shanghai, and at the same time eliminate the black market rice prices in the city.

### North and South Rice Markets Open; Few Transactions in the Markets

[Report from Our Newspaper] The north and south rice markets officially started business at 9 o'clock yesterday. The south market is located on the third floor of 377 Minguo Road, and the main persons in charge are Qiu Fuxiang and Zhu Yongming. The north market is located at 212 Kulun Road, and the main persons in charge are Huang Jinxian and Gu Yisheng. Although the two markets officially started business today, there were not many rice merchants in the market, and transactions were scattered. A total of 303 rice numbers applied for allocation (those who had previously applied but had not yet received allocation). A total of 28 were allocated yesterday, and a large number are expected to be allocated today. It is heard that after the business is established, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, the focus will be on the south market, and on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, the focus will be on the north market.

Yesterday, there were very few rice market transactions, and the digestion of flour turned lax, returning to small three to four hundred yuan. There were few removals of wheat from other places, and there were no formal transactions. Bean cakes were firm in the morning and flat at noon. The yellow bean market was like a shadow, broad beans also had little honor or disgrace, tea beans were priced high and the secondary grade was sluggish, corn was sluggish, bean hemp was high and stable, the secondary grade was cut, cowpeas were flat, and red beans were scarce and firm. The oil market was flooded with incoming goods, digestion was weak, and prices fell by two to three thousand yuan.

### Tea Sellers Raise Prices

China's tea exports are still trapped in a state of silence. Wu Chang, Xinhua, Zhuyutai and other tea shops in this city continued to negotiate with the goods side for Wuyuan Chen Te Gong (a type of tea). Holders unanimously pushed up sales, resulting in a firm market. The market started stable, but soon rose all the way. As a result, each tan (a unit of weight) went straight from 40,000 yuan to 45,000 yuan. The closing market was still firm. As for domestic sales of colored tea, due to the two-day holiday, although it rained after the market opened, the buying interest in the shops and villages of Suxi was still strong. Sellers insisted, so transactions were not abundant and the market remained stable as before.

### Silver Not Worth Worshiping; US Senator Opposes Raising Prices

[Reuters News Agency, New York, 3rd] New York State Congressman Schley, in response to a silver advertisement recently published by the Colorado Mining Association, wrote to the New York Times, stating: There is no reason for the current "silver party" to request that the silver price be raised from 71.11 to 90.5 cents, and then to 1.29 yuan in two years. The current price of silver is already too high, and silver is no longer used as a reserve for currency. Furthermore, silver is originally a by-product of copper and lead, so the silver bill is only a supplementary clause for these metals. Schley also stated that one day, silver will no longer be regarded as a sacred object and worshiped. The true value of silver is far lower than the government's price, so continuing this exaggerated promotion of silver benefits is absurd.

### General Bi Leder Sick in Beiping

— Translated Manuscript of this Newspaper's Translation Office

If one day China's civil war stops and embarks on the path of peaceful and prosperous national construction, then much of the credit should be given to this thirty-two-year-old young Brigadier General, Bi Leder, who is now suffering from typhoid fever and lying ill in the Beiping Naval Hospital.

Hard Work, Wading Through Water

Since arriving in Chongqing in December last year as a military attache at the American Embassy, ​​he has worked tirelessly day and night. He took off his clothes and waded through the icy cold [river name], to inspect rural conflicts. He drove a jeep for hundreds of miles on the most rugged roads in the world. He flew from one corner of China to the other, mediating disputes between the conflicting Kuomintang and Communist generals. He argued, pleaded, persuaded, and got angry. He made sure that both sides gradually reached an agreement.

Red-Faced, Returning to Good Terms

Once, in Shenyang, Communist General Rao Shushi and Government Army Chief of Staff Zhao Jiaxiang quarreled red-faced over an issue. This "Young Brigadier General" quickly came out to mediate, inviting them both to the bathroom. The three of them played with a small toy boat in the bathtub until they were very happy and returned to good terms.

Full of Enthusiasm, Building Airports

Brigadier General Bi Leder turned thirty-three on July 24 of this year. He is from Indiana. After graduating from the military academy in 1937, he obtained a Master of Engineering degree from Cornell University in 1940. Soon after, he was assigned to the China-India-Burma theater to build air force bases. He built B29 Superfortress airports in western China. His only tools were a pencil mark on the map, an extraordinary amount of energy, and a few local words he had learned. In this way, he built the airports.

Following Marshal, Participating in Negotiations

In 1944, he returned to Washington, and then returned to China with Marshal Marshall. He participated in many of the most complex and difficult negotiations, reaching the January 10th ceasefire agreement. A few days later, he became the director of the Military Mediation Execution Department. The political atmosphere in Chongqing soon deteriorated, and China seemed to be on the verge of division again. Brigadier General Bi Leder did everything possible to unite this divided country.

Working Sixteen Hours a Day

He flew to remote rural areas, landing laboriously on makeshift airports where even birds had to be careful when landing, trying to get the conflicting Kuomintang and Communist generals to reconcile. He drove a jeep on rough roads, trying to find the right people to negotiate. In Beiping, he worked sixteen hours a day, trying to get both sides of the conflict to implement the ceasefire agreement. He also often flew to Nanjing to consult with Marshal Marshall, bringing a fresh breath to this busy headquarters.

Traveling in Central Plains, Suffering Greatly

One of the most arduous trips made by Brigadier General Bi Leder was when he flew to Hankou with Generals Xu Yongchang and Zhou Enlai to inspect the Communist Party's accusations of the Kuomintang army's encirclement and annihilation of thousands of Communist troops in the Central Plains. From Hankou to the investigation site was eighty miles - a three-day walk. The road was terrible. Torrential rain washed away all the bridges. The river rose very high. Bi Leder directed the temporarily hired workers to use bamboo poles to carry the jeep and wade across the river, with the water reaching everyone's necks - including Bi Leder, of course. After the matter was over, he returned to Nanjing and flew a small transport plane himself. He had a big crash when landing, which made the people at the airport sweat a lot. The plane jumped forty feet high, but Bi Leder got out of the plane with a smile on his face, holding the signed agreement in his hand, and then went to participate in a series of difficult meetings, running back and forth between Marshal Marshall, Zhou Enlai, and Chairman Chiang. Bi Leder was thinner and more haggard, but he still worked with his usual energy.

Flying to Changchun, Mediating the War

He flew to Changchun to serve as the leader of the advance team of the Military Mediation Execution Department, preparing to mediate the war in the Northeast. He stayed for a long time, then returned to Beiping to have a tooth pulled. By then, he was already very tired from overwork. The doctor advised him to rest in the hospital for a longer period of time, but he refused. He took new instructions and new hopes and returned to Changchun.

In Changchun, Bi Leder suddenly developed a high fever and returned to Beiping. It is said that he is suffering from typhoid fever, but it has not been completely determined. But one thing is clear to everyone: he damaged his own health in order to seek peace within China. (Associated Press, June 30)

Illegal Occupation of Rented House

Mr. Editor: I was a tenant at 182 Kulun Road before the war. During the enemy occupation, the house was seized by the Japanese, and after the victory, it was illegally occupied by military personnel. The property was returned to the owner, Yeguang Company, by the Central Trust Bureau for civilian residence. Because I was a long-term tenant before the war, I had priority and rented 182 Kulun Road. Now, it is forcibly occupied by the barber shop of the Welfare Society of the Ministry of Military Administration. However, the barber shop is not operated by the military but is a collusion between a civilian, Qiu Zhifu, and a Mr. Guo of the Welfare Society, using the name as a pretense. I have petitioned the Housing Allocation Committee of the Shanghai Administrative Yuan three times, and the committee has sent personnel to investigate five times, but to this day, there has been no approval. I pay the rent, water, electricity, and gas bills every month. I ask you, is it that those who do not pay rent can live there, while those who do pay cannot? Is this reasonable? I request the Housing Allocation Committee to uphold justice immediately and return the house to the civilian resident. Xi Qi. 29th.

Students Not Receiving Milk Powder

Mr. Editor: We are students at the private Jingrui Primary School affiliated Civil School, located at the Dananmen in the Nanshi district. We heard that civil school students were also receiving milk powder rations. We happily took our containers to receive them. Who knew that during class, the teacher lectured us, "You are so old, what are you eating milk powder for?!" The students looked at each other, not daring to say much. We think there are many students in the civil school, and each person receiving two pounds is a considerable amount. Nominally, we are receiving it, but in reality, it is all taken by the school. Naturally, we are resentful. We request the Education Bureau and the Shanghai Branch of the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to investigate the swallowed milk powder and use it to aid the refugees in Northern Jiangsu. Students Zhang Ziqiang, Wang Wenzhao, et al., respectfully submit.

### Chief of Staff Chen's Message to Officers and Soldiers Nationwide (Continued from the First Page of the Previous Day)

Second, regarding the significant achievements from last year to the present, they can be roughly divided into the reorganization of the army, the repatriation of enemy prisoners, the collection and disposal of enemy and puppet military supplies, and the demobilization of the Youth Army. A brief description of each is provided below:

(1) Reorganization of the Army: The National Army originally had 89 infantry corps, 239 divisions (including three corps and eight divisions of the Youth Army, excluding the 25th Division, 120th Division, and 39th Division of the Communist Army), and two cavalry corps, 13 divisions. From March of this year to February of next year, they are to be reorganized into 30 infantry corps (totaling 90 divisions) and 10 cavalry brigades. The surplus officers and soldiers will be discharged or transferred to other jobs. The reorganization and demobilization work of the above units will be implemented in two steps.

The first step is to reduce each corps by one-third, that is, a corps originally with three divisions and nine regiments will be reduced to a division with three brigades, and a corps originally with two divisions and six regiments will be reduced to a division with two brigades and four regiments. Each independent division will be reorganized into an independent brigade with two regiments. The second step will be implemented according to the basic plan signed by the military three-person team. However, after the 90 divisions are formed according to the prescribed organization, they should be gradually organized into 30 corps, each corps having two divisions, and gradually placed in the positions specified in the basic plan. The reorganization work of the above-mentioned first step will be implemented in three phases. The first phase of reorganization involves 27 corps and 66 divisions along the Longhai Railway and in the Northwest (excluding Xinjiang and Hexi), starting in March and completed by the end of April; the second phase of reorganization involves 32 corps and 92 divisions in the Yangtze River basin and south of the Yangtze River, starting on May 1 and completed by the end of June; the third phase starts on July 1, and the plan has already been drafted. Once the reorganization of the first step mentioned above is completed, the reorganization of the second step will continue to be implemented. The method is as follows: each infantry division will be reorganized into 90 infantry divisions according to the official organization, each division with two brigades and four regiments, totaling 14,000 people, and each corps headquarters will have approximately 6,300 directly subordinate troops. The starting date of the reorganization of each corps and division shall be determined by the Executive Headquarters for Mediation, and the organizational structure of the corps and divisions shall be determined separately. Each division originally with a three-brigade and six-regiment system will be adjusted to a division with a two-brigade and four-regiment system. In North China, a total of seven corps must be formed into one corps according to the prescribed organization before September 1 of this year, so that it can be combined with the Communist Army into a group army in the seventh month (i.e., September of this year). The other six corps can be formed separately later, and two or three corps will be designated to be combined with the Communist Army into a group army. However, there are still two points that need to be added: (1) In the first and second phases of the reorganization, all corps were reduced to divisions, and divisions were reduced to brigades. In the future, all original directly subordinate troops, except for a few cancellations, will be retained. For example, if each division has already canceled one regiment and transport company, then three new reconnaissance platoons will be established at the same time. (2) Although the reorganization plan for the third phase has been drafted, the Communist Army did not comply with the ceasefire agreement and launched offensives everywhere, causing domestic chaos, making it impossible to implement in reality.

(2) Repatriation of Enemy Prisoners: A total of more than 2 million Japanese prisoners and expatriates within China (excluding the Northeast) including northern Vietnam, were decided to be repatriated to their home country, in the plan decided at the Sino-American Joint Conference held in Shanghai on October 25 of last year, and a number of Japanese ships were used for transportation starting from November 15. The ports decided to be used were Tanggu, Qingdao, Lianyungang, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Haikou, Shantou, Xiamen, Haiphong, Keelung, Kaohsiung, and other eleven locations. The Inland Japanese Prisoner and Expatriate Removal Headquarters transported them to various ports. As for the establishment of transportation headquarters at each port, they were responsible for handling the inspection of Japanese prisoners and expatriates when they boarded the ships. Japanese prisoners and expatriates repatriated to their home country were allowed to carry 1,000 Japanese yen for civilians, 500 Japanese yen for officers, and 200 Japanese yen for soldiers, as well as their clothes and personal belongings. If they exceeded the regulations or had prohibited items, they would be confiscated and kept by the Chinese government as part of the future war reparations. All Japanese prisoners and expatriates in various regions were required to be completely repatriated by July 15. As of the end of June, a total of more than 1.95 million people had been repatriated to their home country.

(3) The plan for the collection and disposal of enemy and puppet military supplies divides the country into ten collection areas (Beijing-Shanghai, Wuhan, Beijing-Tianjin, Jiaoji, Vietnam, Guangzhou, Kaifeng, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Northeast). A special commissioner was dispatched to each area to handle the matter. Each area had gradually completed the receiving by the end of March of this year, and three additional verification committees were dispatched to verify the receiving by area, which is still in progress. As for the utilization of enemy and puppet military supplies, a plan was devised early and is being implemented step by step. All supplies of a supply nature, such as grain, ammunition, and fuel, will be supplied nearby in accordance with regulations. All supplies of a replenishment nature, such as weapons, clothing, and various equipment, will be allocated to the troops according to their needs. All supplies of an enrichment allocation nature, such as tanks, automobiles, and horses, will be used to enrich the troops separately. All raw materials from military factories will be used to start production in factories early and gradually, and raw materials will be allocated and utilized in a unified manner. (To be continued)

Third, after the war, our government has a lot of work to do, and it seems that it is not necessary for the government to hastily take back the investments of foreigners in the public utilities of this city. We must know that if we have such a huge sum of money, it can be used for other more important constructions, or for municipal constructions that we have not yet undertaken. Moreover, once the atmosphere of takeover is promoted, it will inevitably have a great reaction on foreign investment in China, which I think should be taken seriously.

Based on the above, I believe that foreign companies with achievements should be maintained, that is, given reasonable profits: however, they should be appropriately coordinated with Chinese companies, so that they can cooperate with each other, and it is best to implement mergers, so that one industry is operated by one company. All Shanghai citizens have the same right to enjoy the same rights and obligations, and at the same time, they can use the trained management and technical personnel of each company to prepare for the construction of state-owned public utilities.

The following is a report on the improvement situation from January to June of the 35th year and the future plan. At the same time, because Shanghai is in short supply of water, electricity, gas, and transportation, it is necessary to treat both the symptoms and the root causes.

### Water Supply

Drinking water is the foundation of public health for citizens. In January of this year, the Bureau invited representatives from the Health Bureau and various water plants to discuss and determine drinking water standards. The main points are that the number of coliform bacteria in one liter of water sample should not exceed ten, and the total hardness should not exceed 300. This regulation is now being implemented. According to the statistics in April, the total water production for the whole month was 11.74 million cubic meters (equivalent to 268.28 million gallons), and the sales volume was 7.15 million cubic meters (equivalent to 157.3 million gallons). Based on the city's population of 3.5 million, the average daily water consumption per person is approximately 15 gallons. Compared to the average daily water consumption of 8.2 gallons per person in the city in December, there has been significant progress, because the water consumption in June needs to be increased due to the hot weather, so April is used as a representative. If the equipment can be improved to fully utilize the water production, the average daily water consumption per person can be increased to more than 20 gallons.

However, the installation of tap water is not universal in the western part of Shanghai. Now is the summer season, and drinking water hygiene is even more important. The Bureau has long been preparing to restore the water supply stations before the war to solve this problem, but the sorting out and replenishment of water pipes, as well as the installation of water meters, require a large amount of money and take a considerable amount of time, which cannot meet the current urgent needs. Therefore, we are drawing up retail methods for tap water to be regularly sold to citizens in the area. In order to make it more universal, public faucets will be opened for a certain period of time every day in various civilian areas to provide free relief.

As for the fundamental plan, it is roughly as follows:

There are currently five tap water companies in Shanghai. The trunk and branch pipelines of each company almost cover the entire bustling urban area, but the western part of Shanghai is exclusively absent. In the former extra-settlement road area, although the British tap water company used to take over the supply, the area is too far from the British water plant (about 15 kilometers) and the pipe diameter is too small (2 inches to 6 inches), resulting in a pressure as low as 15 feet (the standard pressure should be between 30 feet and 50 feet), which cannot be fully supplied. Before the war, in order to thoroughly solve the water supply problem in western Shanghai, the municipal government advocated the establishment of a Shanghai West Tap Water Company in the form of Sino-foreign joint venture, and established a new water plant south of Longhua and upstream of the Huangpu River to seek a comprehensive solution. At that time, there was considerable progress in the discussion, but it was shelved due to the outbreak of the August 13 Incident. The Bureau is currently negotiating and proceeding to realize it as soon as possible.

After the establishment of the Shanghai West Tap Water Company, the entire Shanghai tap water supply network (Water Supply Grid) can be roughly completed. Ways will be found to connect the water pipes between the exclusive operating areas of each company, so that they can be connected to each other. In case of emergency needs, they can supply each other. In this way, although there are six companies in Shanghai, it is actually no different from one organization. The city's sound water supply network will be completed by this time.

As for the distribution of water plants and the division of exclusive operating areas of the existing companies, there will inevitably be various unreasonable places. The utilization of each other's mechanical power pipelines is very uneconomical, but these things are all bound by exclusive contracts, and reasonable adjustments must be made gradually according to the circumstances.

### People of Yangzhou Never Forget General Fei: Invite Dong Mingde to Toast the Victory; Hope Air Force Colleagues Inquire About the Current Situation of Dong Jun to Comfort the Public's Expectations

Mr. Editor: Please forgive me for not being polite. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, the air force stationed in our Yangzhou, probably the Fifth Squadron, had an anti-Japanese hero, Mr. Dong Mingde, the captain. The impression he gave to the people of Yangzhou was too profound! Because once, three enemy planes came to bomb our Yangzhou airfield. After two hours of fierce fighting, they were all swept down and shot down by this anti-Japanese hero, Captain Dong. This victory not only dealt a fatal blow to the enemy, but also boosted the people's confidence in winning the war. Although Yangzhou was the air force base near the Shanghai and Nanjing area, the enemy planes were timid because of Captain Dong's bravery, and dared not invade again. Yangzhou no longer suffered the pain of air raids. In all fairness, it was entirely due to Captain Dong's bravery. Later, when Shanghai and Nanjing fell, the air force in Yangzhou also withdrew. Later, in the newspaper, I saw that Captain Dong chased the enemy planes over Jiangyin, and single-handedly broke into the enemy's formation, and was shot down again. After the National Army continued to withdraw westward, Captain Dong's fame gradually alienated from the people of Yangzhou. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won and the sun and the moon have been shining again, during these eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, I dare say that no Yangzhou person does not miss this hero's safety and health; no Yangzhou person does not hope that this hero can come to Yangzhou; accept our cheers and salute. At the very least, we have to come and toast a glass of victory wine. But we do not know the whereabouts of this hero now, so we are writing to your newspaper, asking you to publish it, and to find a way to inquire about the whereabouts of the hero from the air force authorities. I think your newspaper will not disappoint the 100,000 people of Yangzhou for this little bit of foolishness. To show our seriousness, we are sending it by registered mail. I humbly request your safety, Liu Zhonghe.

[Editor's note] This search for a person's manuscript is sincere, earnest, enthusiastic, and deeply moving! We will be happy to publish it. Dong Jun's loyalty, bravery, and anti-Japanese war have contributed to the party and the country, which is admirable! What is the current situation? Please tell us as soon as possible. If Dong Jun is not in this port, please ask the air force colleagues to inform us of his whereabouts, and this column will forward it on his behalf.

Spring and Autumn

### A Record of Situ Qiao's War Disaster Painting Exhibition — Zhao Jingshen

The sky was covered with dark clouds, and I hurried out of my house, took the tram to the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge, and went to see Situ Qiao's war disaster painting exhibition in the five provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Henan. Fortunately, when I arrived on the third floor, it was pouring rain outside. Watching Situ Qiao's paintings on such a gloomy and rainy day - a tour of this hell on earth.

I was very happy to meet Mr. Situ Qiao, with a long beard and protruding eyes, quite like a foreign missionary. Indeed, he should be a pastor. He has the compassionate heart of Feng Zikai, who also has a long beard. Later, he introduced his wife Yi Mei to me, and I read many of her excellent poems on the paintings. They are truly an ideal couple, like Zhao Mingcheng and Li Qingzhao in the Song Dynasty.

Although there are only eighty paintings, the legs became weak after seeing it once because the content was substantial. I have admired Situ Qiao's paintings for a long time. More than ten years ago, many of the literary and artistic paintings of the Beixin Bookstore were painted by him and Tao Yuanqing for the cover. This exhibition made me even more delighted with his superb artistic skills and his thorough and accurate understanding of life. I heard that the exhibition will be open until the 7th.

This exhibition gave me an inspiration: war is indeed too terrible. Looking at the terrible scene of the whole family starving to death in the "Ghost Shadow in Empty Room" picture, everyone will be shocked. My heart was suddenly lifted up, the mother was as thin as a skeleton, and the child who died from eating grass roots and tree bark with a distended belly, no wonder the author had to paint with tears. His paintings, such as the famine victims in Quanzhou, the rogues, the famine refugees, the waiting to be fed, the starved corpses, the sun-baked pictures, the cart, the gnawing of wild grass, etc., all illustrate the famine of the people. The war caused people to be separated from their wives and children, and the war caused people to starve to death. On the other hand, there are people enjoying themselves in high-rise buildings, so the starving corpses are entitled with Du Shaoling's poem: "The rich man's gate smells of wine and meat, and the road has frozen bones." Yi Mei entitled the boat girl: "The eyes shake the moon, the rain shakes the wind, the painting shakes everything, the night shakes the dream, it can't shake off the cold, it can't shake off poverty, the price of rice is bitterly high and the donation is heavy!"

Another terrible side of war is the destruction of engineering and industry. For example, the ruins of the Yufeng Yarn Factory in Zhengzhou, Henan, the Lukou Iron Bridge, the ruins of the Guilin Textile Factory, the ruins of the Nanxuan Library, and the Liuzhou Railway Station. There is also a steaming room that has become a rubble, writing about the Liuzhou Alcohol Factory, and Rong Bridge writing that when the enemy attacked, we had to blow up the iron bridge, but our army who was crossing the bridge failed to withdraw, and with a bang, they were all torn to pieces. On the one hand, we also see reconstruction, rebuilding our homes, bombing and reconstruction, and Wuzhou, which is being rebuilt. Yes, the word "reconstruction" is repeatedly seen in the painting title, which shows how eagerly the author hopes that a new China can be built. After the Anti-Japanese War, it should be the construction of the country. After suffering foreign insults, the people can no longer withstand the civil war! I hope that both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can work together to build a new China.

Looking at the pictures of the national martyrs, Hao Menglin, Zhang Zizhong, Xie Jinyuan, Dai Haiwen, Zhao Tong, and other generals and righteous men are all showing us that we must properly reorganize this broken country. They stared with white eyes and hoped that we would not fail them, these victims. I believe that their blood is still boiling underground.

Please look at "Turning Spears into Plowshares." This is what we need now. The fields will be deserted, the industrial zone will become ruins, won't you be able to breathe before another war? If we fight again, the tragedy will be even worse than this, I can't bear to imagine it.

Mo Ruo and Nai Chao came to see the paintings with Shao Qiongdu, the sky was already clear, and the sun shone on the studio. I wish and hope that this is a sign of light!

### Short Notes

— Shi Bei

Because of the family’s urging, you had to leave in a hurry. When I saw you off that day, it was a gloomy morning; only the two of us were by the riverbank. We walked slowly. At first, we were as silent as the fog on the river. For a long time, we lowered our heads, not saying a word to each other. Later, unable to bear the oppressive silence, I finally asked you, "Do you love Bin?"

You looked at me for a long time before saying with what seemed like great determination:

"In the past half year, besides you and Bin, who can understand me, no one else in the crowd can understand me or help me." Then you lowered your head and said, "He is so sincere, passionate, and helpful... I love him."

I believe you, because you are a naive and pure girl. But when you were about to leave, Bin was lying down, his eyes wide open and staring blankly at the ceiling. I asked him to get up and see you off, but he claimed to be sick. I asked several times, but he refused. Because of his distressed appearance, I was worried and also suspected the shadows hidden between you. So when I saw you off alone, after simply asking you that one question, I didn't say anything else. Only you can hide the deception behind it, and I can't dispel that hidden worry; my heart felt like a heavy lead weight, sinking down. I came back after seeing you off, and Bin didn't say anything to me either. I held onto it, waiting for an unpredictable mystery to be revealed one day automatically.

It was a Sunday, a week after you left. Because I had lost your laughter and singing for so long, the dormitory was even more silent. Only Bin and I sat in silence in the room, listening to the sound of rain and wind outside the window, with no mood to talk at all. I was okay, just a little lonely in my heart, but Bin's heart was hard to describe. The green trees outside, which used to be where we talked and made funny faces, now seemed like a primitive forest, lurking with mystery and hiding terror.

Yesterday, he just lay in bed all day, stiffly, his eyes habitually blank, staring at the gloomy sky outside the window, like a net of iron. He seemed to anticipate some terrible change coming, not speaking, not smiling. I wanted to find something to say to comfort him, but what words could have such miraculous effect? He had first closed the "door of negotiation" on himself tightly, making me lack the courage to open my mouth, and even if I had thousands of words of sympathy and comfort, there was no way to say them. A long, silent afternoon passed like that, the two of us silently facing each other; my eyes staring blankly at him, his eyes staring blankly at the square of sky outside the window. Night came, and after the darkness had occupied our room for a long time, I finally turned on the light. The pale light shone on us, and I almost couldn't help but shed tears.

"Bin! Are you worried?"

"She still said she loved you when she left."

"What? Is he really sick?"

I didn't look at him, just pressed on with my questions, but other than the sound of turning on the bed, no one answered me. I was ruled by the night.

Early this morning, Zhi Deng floated in, carrying two wedding invitations. I was surprised and delighted to tear open the bright red envelopes and pull out the beautiful pink paper folded inside. Oh! I couldn't believe it. The names printed on it were yours, and next to your name was Ming, whom you often called "Big Brother." Isn't this a huge, merciless mockery of honesty? Has the unpredictable mystery been revealed?

Bin grabbed the red invitation, as if he had fallen into an abyss of despair. What was he thinking? Was he regretting? Or hating? Who knows, who can say. Turgenev wrote in the last section of "A Nest of Gentlefolk," that Liza's eyelashes trembled almost imperceptibly, but I saw his eyelashes trembling, saw him struggling, groaning, his whole soul shaking, exploding, vanishing... In an instant, the covers of the two red invitations were torn to shreds with a whoosh. But the two pink papers were not torn, made a gesture of tearing, and then suddenly and unconsciously fell back into the bed.

I retreated to my bedside, sighing softly, "Once you enter the gates of a noble house, they are as deep as the sea, and from then on, Xiao Lang is a stranger." I never thought that a girl would deceive a loyal, honest, passionate, and loving person! I hate, hate that these two extremes, honesty and deception, are constantly mocking life!

Originally, I shouldn't say such things, but the facts are forcing me to say them. Please forgive me. You know, because both Bin and I are poor children, there is no way for us to send you a gift. At the same time, Bin asked me not to leave him and not to leave here, so I can't go to congratulate you on your grand ceremony.

You used to say that I was a timid and awkward child in front of girls. I admit your words, especially now, I am even more convinced of the correctness of this statement. Now, let this timid child offer you some shy greetings!

### Depression (5)

— Hu Shanyuan

Depression from the environment

For a long time, the environment has become a place of complaint. If anyone is unhappy, they complain about the environment; if they fail, or suffer losses, they complain about the environment; even if children are not progressing, if sons are thieves and daughters prostitutes, if morality is declining, all the evils that arise are blamed on the environment. If the environment were a living thing, it would be actively killed, or it would be suffocated to death under public censure. The environment has become a punching bag, a scapegoat. If the environment had consciousness, it would burst into tears!

But what exactly is the environment? The environment has no mouth, it cannot defend itself or explain itself. If the environment had a mouth, it would definitely say that all kinds of evils were not done by it, but by the people who scold it. It didn't exist in the first place, the people who scold it created it, and then did all kinds of evils and attributed them to it. If it were a living thing, it would definitely understand this reasoning, and it would definitely feel depressed.

Moreover, the environment is also like an organism, constantly moving forward and upward. A comparison of ancient and modern history will show this. However, some people are unwilling to let it move forward and upward, wanting it to fall behind and regress. For every step it takes forward, some people will even pull it back two steps. It struggles endlessly, always struggling to move forward and upward. It works so hard, yet it cannot be understood by people, and people simply complain about it, which makes it feel especially depressed.

People are unwilling to make it an environment that supports prosperous publishing, and publishers complain about it, which it really cannot understand. Why are there so many selfish and self-serving people, causing prices to rise, making people unable to make a living, so that publishing costs have reached unprecedented heights? It not only wants publishers to have publishing convenience, but also wants publishers to agree with the editors' opinions and publish good publications, which is also to say that it wants writers to write good things, so that readers can read good spiritual food. It has a belly full of compassion, but it is not understood by people, and what it gets is only complaints, so it cannot avoid depression!

It especially understands that education is the greatest tool for reducing or even eliminating selfish and self-serving people. And publishing occupies a very important position in the categories of education. It hopes that it can become a perfect environment, suitable for human survival, and starts with publishing, but now there are a few thoroughly selfish people who control everything, disrupt everything, and destroy everything, making it unable to be improved and unsuitable for human survival, and they still blame it. There is no greater injustice in the world than this! In addition to depression, it simply has no words to explain, and a hundred deaths would not atone!

However, from this, we can also understand that the environment is the linchpin of all current events. We must relieve the depression of the environment before we can talk about relieving all other depressions, and only when the depression of the environment is relieved will all other depressions be relieved along with it, and our most original readers will have proper spiritual food to enjoy.

To catch thieves, catch the king first. We must strive to relieve the depression of the environment, otherwise, bit by bit, we will never have a reasonable life, let alone proper spiritual food!

### Reading Mr. Wang Jinshan's Paintings

— Jiang Xingyu

The development of Chinese painting in the Tang Dynasty underwent a fundamental change due to the influence of Indian culture. As a result, painters intentionally or unintentionally became preachers of Indian philosophy, and their ideology was more or less covered with a layer of metaphysics. In terms of subject matter, works based on stories and figures from Buddhist scriptures also began to occupy a significant proportion. In the past century, traditional Chinese culture, due to its own aging and poverty, urgently needs to gain new life and has absorbed Western culture. As a major sector of culture, painting is no exception. Generally, excellent painters have begun to flexibly apply Western techniques. Even the most typical Chinese paintings often implicitly contain the style of Matisse or the style of Picasso.

Mr. Jinshan has a high degree of cultivation in Chinese painting, and is especially able to critically accept the heritage of past generations. He also has a widespread and in-depth contact with general scholarship. These conditions have sublimated his painting to the realm of art.

Regarding the statues of Guanyin Bodhisattva and Arhats, Mr. Jinshan's brushwork is very skilled and powerful, making us feel as if these deities are not illusory, but are real existences that we often see and hear, and are just like us, one of the many beings in the vast world. In recent years, painters who have worked hard on Buddhism and Taoism, such as Zhang Daqian, Zhang Heng, and Lei Zhen, have mostly used the hard work of copying on the Dunhuang murals or Dazu stone carvings. Mr. Jinshan creates more based on subjective imagination, encompassing more freehand elements. They have all achieved brilliant achievements, truly the so-called "There is more than one road to Rome."

"Overlapping Mountains," "Gorge Stream and Sails," and "Mountain Stream and Small Bridge" are all landscapes of Sichuan. I spent a long time in Sichuan, and since coming east, I have always been thinking about that rich red basin. When I gaze at the clear river water on the painting, a mountain peak faintly visible in the misty white fog, it feels like a reunion with an old friend, with indescribable joy and indescribable intimacy.

I am a lover of painting, but I lack the ability to appreciate and understand. Occasionally, when I write some critical texts, I inevitably come close to scratching an itch from outside my boot. Mr. Jinshan has been a respected friend for many years and will surely not be surprised by my superficiality. Therefore, I have recorded the impressions and thoughts gained at the exhibition as above.

### Staying Together (74)

— Zhao Qingge

Out of sympathy, Lihua often went to visit Shi Yulou. Her impression of Shi Yulou in the past was vague and indifferent. Also, because their personalities were both taciturn, they rarely spoke at ordinary times, so a deep friendship never developed. However, compared to some people in her environment, Lihua still had some good feelings for Shi Yulou. Especially after Shi Yulou went crazy, she felt even more sorry for him, just like she felt sorry for herself.

Shi Yulou was actually sick! His mind was still not very clear. And he coughed very badly and kept spitting up blood. He had aged beyond recognition! The doctor said it was consumption and that he needed to eat more tonics and nourishing foods. But this was impossible. His finances could barely maintain his and Madam Weng's life, plus the expense of opium. He was already in debt. How could he still have the strength to treat his illness and nourish his body? For his sake, Madam Weng had recently taken on washing clothes for guests at the apartment. In addition, Madam Mo would help from time to time. (Madam Mo had never been bad to Madam Weng, and at the same time, she was repaying Shi Yulou for teaching Bawa how to act.) Shi Yulou was also very grateful to Madam Weng for her willingness to endure hardships for him, but sometimes he couldn't help but feel annoyed! He felt that if it weren't for Madam Weng's constraints, he could be more relaxed, at least he could run the docks again. It was always easier for him to get by alone, and with one more person, his actions were not free. Thinking of this, he regretted not bringing Madam Weng out of Jingzhou. He blamed himself for not knowing his own limitations, for not thinking that he would have such a down-and-out day.

If one day an actor who treats acting as his first life has his "play" finished, then everything is finished. Shi Yulou's madness arose from this! He was sad that he had been acting for nearly thirty years, and that once he accidentally messed up because of his poor health, the audience would ruthlessly overturn his entire brilliant history of the past thirty years! What a cruel blow! At the same time, how unconvinced it made him! He wanted to "make a comeback," but he calculated his age and realized that he was already forty years old. In any case, he could not outshine a young and beautiful person. So he was sad! He complained! He cursed!

One day, Lihua came to see Shi Yulou, bringing him a pack of "Da Qian Men" cigarettes (this was the gift she often gave Shi Yulou). Shi Yulou smoked, broke through his past silence, took Lihua's hand and said:

### Dull Thief

— Wei Yan

I happened to read Gu Tinglin's Rizhilu, in which he said: "The people of the Ming Dynasty, all their writings are nothing but theft... The people of today only have poor behavior and no talent, and cannot understand the meaning of the author. The books they steal will certainly not be as good as the original, what harm is there in calling them dull thieves?" The current Chinese publishing industry makes us feel the same as Mr. Tinglin, and we are even afraid that even such dull thieves cannot be had in abundance.

I would divide recent Chinese writings into three categories: The first category is plagiarism and copying. They copy a section from foreign sources here and a section there, "compiling" them into books, many of which are "dull thieves who do not understand the author's meaning." The books they create are often awkward and difficult to read to the end. The second category is to thoroughly read and digest the works of various authors and then elaborate on them. This is "narrating but not creating." It sounds logical and fascinating. The third category is truly mature works that can "establish a school of thought" of their own. This is the crystallization of the author's years of thought, experience, or experimental research. In the current Chinese publishing industry, many books of the first category can be seen, books of the second category are already rare, and books of the third category are simply non-existent.

These three categories of books can also represent three stages of academic development. From the perspective of individual progress, writing articles is mostly plagiarism at first, then narrating but not creating, and then moving further to be able to create. So I think there is nothing to fear about plagiarism, but there is fear about permanent plagiarism without progress. In terms of the progress of the entire culture, the initial stage is imitation, the second is digestion, and the final stage is creation. From the analysis of recent Chinese publications, it seems that China has not yet reached the stage of creation since contacting Western culture. We seem to be progressing too slowly. Can those engaged in academia not reflect deeply?

### Beethoven Biography

— Written by Zhu Li, Romain Rolland, Translated by Fu Lei

Shanghai Camel Bookstore, First Edition, April of the Thirty-Fifth Year

Beethoven had a bold saying: "Joy bought with pain." (Letter to Mrs. Erdödy, October 10, 1815) This bold saying can explain his whole life: an unfortunate man, poor, crippled, lonely, a man made by pain, created joy to give to the world.

Ludwig van Beethoven was born on December 16, 1770, in Bonn, near Cologne, in the attic of a dilapidated house. He was of Flemish descent; his father was an unintelligent and alcoholic tenor singer, and his mother was a maid. He was accompanied by misfortune, and life for him was a tragic and brutal struggle. Beethoven's childhood passed in misery: his mother died early, his father was an alcoholic, and at seventeen, he became the head of the family, bearing the responsibility for the education of two brothers. The Revolution broke out, flooding all of Europe and occupying Beethoven's heart. The University of Bonn was a center of new ideas, and on May 14, 1789, Beethoven enrolled. In November 1792, as the war spread to Bonn, Beethoven went to Vienna. His musical achievements gradually improved, and at the same time, his beliefs became firmer. He said, "My art should benefit the poor." Misfortune followed misfortune. Between 1796 and 1800, deafness began its torture. At first, Beethoven tried his best to endure it, but it was impossible. The chronic disease made him unable to hear the high notes of instruments and singing. This sorrow was expressed in his works, such as the "Pathétique Sonata" (1799), the Largo in the Sonata from Complete Works, Volume 10, No. 3, but not all of his works were melancholic, such as the joyful "Septet" (1800) and the crystal-clear "First Symphony" (1800). On top of these physical pains was added another kind of pain: he held a fierce passion, constantly falling in love, intoxicated and madly falling, dreaming of happiness, but later he was deceived by love and became a victim of love. In 1801, his passionate object was Giulietta Guicciardi, to whom he dedicated the famous "Moonlight Sonata" (1802). Giulietta married Count Gallenberg in November 1803, causing Beethoven's soul to be devastated, almost ending his life. Love, pain, decadence, and a proud will were all reflected in the great works of 1802: the Sonata with a Funeral March (Complete Works, Volume 26); the Fantasy Sonata, commonly known as the Moonlight Sonata, Sonata from Volume 31, No. 2; the Violin Sonata dedicated to Emperor Alexander; the Kreutzer Sonata; and the six tragic and painful religious songs in Volume 48. The "Second Symphony" of 1803, however, reflects his youthful love, clearly showing that his will dominated. The revolution moved Beethoven, and he dreamed of a heroic republic. He successively wrote the "Eroica Symphony"; "Bonaparte" (1804); the epic of the empire; and the finale of the "Fifth Symphony" (1805-08), a glorious narrative poem. In May 1806, Beethoven became engaged to Therese von Brunswick. The "Fourth Symphony" written in this year is a pure flower. Love abandoned him, and in 1810, he became lonely again. Love was gone; ambition was gone; all that remained was strength, and his behavior became even more outrageous. Goethe tried to get to know Beethoven and met him in 1812 at Teplitz, a spa in Bohemia, but they did not get along very well due to their different personalities. The "Seventh" and "Eighth Symphonies" were works of this period, written in Teplitz in 1812. 1814 was the peak of Beethoven's luck, and at the Congress of Vienna, he was seen as the glory of Europe. But what followed was the most tragic period: the proud and independent genius was unpopular, the promised subsidy was not paid in full, and his ears were completely deaf. In this abyss of bitterness, Beethoven sang the joy. This was his lifelong plan, which he had in mind since 1793 in Bonn. The theme of the Ode to Joy in the "Ninth Symphony" was written in 1822. But when writing the "Ninth Symphony," he had not yet made up his mind and still wanted to leave the Ode to Joy for the Tenth or Eleventh Symphony. Beethoven, in a state of depression, was thinking of leaving his homeland, but he stayed because of the success of the first performance of the "Ninth Symphony" (May 7, 1824). Material life was as difficult as ever, plagued by poverty and illness, and without reliance, but he overcame fate and pain. He shouted: "Sacrifice, always sacrifice all the ignorance of life for your art!" The new ending of the quartet in Complete Works 130, completed four months before his death, is very brisk. In November 1826, he caught a pleuritic cold, returning from running errands for his nephew's future, and fell ill in Vienna. On March 26, 1827, Beethoven took his last breath in a great storm, in a great snowstorm, in a clap of thunder.

This is Beethoven's life. In Romain Rolland's writing, he is a giant of passionate repression and courageous battle. In the original work, in addition to the biographical part, there are also "Beethoven's Will," "Collection of Letters," and "Thoughts."

The translator, Fu Lei, attached an article entitled "Beethoven's Works and His Spirit," which first praised the power of Beethoven's spirit. Secondly, it analyzes Beethoven's contribution to music: overturning the rigid rules of the sonata; although the harmony is very simple and classical, it has made great progress compared with the previous generation; and the reform of the use of musical instruments. Because of him, music changed from a dead academic subject to a living consciousness. Finally, it interprets Beethoven's important works, such as piano sonatas, violin and piano sonatas, quartets, ensemble pieces, symphonies, and religious music.

In order to appreciate literature or to understand the life of a great musician, this book is worth reading. Romain Rolland's lively and passionate writing and the translator's faithful and fluent translation need no introduction.

### Reading "Little Slope's Birthday"

"Little Slope's Birthday" is one of Lao She's early works. It is a lengthy fairy tale of nearly 60,000 words; it can be roughly divided into two parts: the first part describes fragments of the life of a child named Little Slope, and the second part narrates a tortuous and bizarre dream, which is the dream Little Slope had on his birthday night.

Little Slope is a Chinese boy growing up in Singapore. His father is a shop owner, and his mother is the most loving mother. His elder brother is called Big Slope, and his younger sister is called Fairy Slope. They have a very happy family. We know that every child in the world has his own world to live in, and Little Slope is of course no exception. He is so innocent and curious that he is always interested in the smallest things, constantly asking and thinking, and never willing to be still for a moment. Whether he is playing with his companions or alone, he has endless joy, often looking up and smiling at this "mysterious" world, even though he understands so little. Little Slope can't figure out these things: "Is Guangdong the same as India?"; "Is the color of snow red? Is it the small pieces of red paper that people scatter on the bride and groom when they come out?"; "When the train moves, do the streets, trees, people, horses, houses, and telephone poles run backwards?"; "Why do teachers love to teach so much? Don't they like to play?"; and "Why do teachers only want to ask what 7 times 7 is? Isn't '8' more pleasing to the eye than '7', and it can also be used as glasses when viewed horizontally?"... Little Slope can't understand these strange questions, but he can find ways to deal with his sister's various questions.

Little Slope has a most precious "secret": he hopes to become a "great" person in the future; an Indian gatekeeper, with a large white turban wrapped around his head, standing there imposingly, guarding the shop for his sister; or "when he grows up, he can become a Malay police officer, standing at the intersection, directing traffic; as long as his arm moves slightly, all the cars will move or stop according to his 'orders'. How powerful is that!" Little Slope is overjoyed. He really wants to grow up immediately and do what he likes to do; but he doesn't dare to tell his parents and teachers about this "ridiculous extravagance"; only when his father goes to the shop and his mother takes a nap, does he quietly mention it to Fairy Slope in the house. He also wraps a red silk scarf around his head or around his waist, enthusiastically performing, Fairy Slope doesn't understand these things, but always responds with a smile, she feels that her second brother is a truly remarkable hero.

At school, Little Slope likes to "fight injustice". He often uses his "head" to knock down "Baldy Zhang" who specializes in bullying girls. He talks about public morality and never deliberately damages the ducks and piglets hanging in other people's shops. When he sees an old woman on the road who can't carry her things, he rushes over to help and never asks for any reward, because he feels that he is a good boy.

Little Slope doesn't really like going to school and often escapes from the classroom to play when the teacher is dozing off, but when he is serious, he has a strong understanding and can understand many things.

One day, on Little Slope's birthday, his father was not as stern as usual and took him and his two brothers to the zoo to see the monkeys. In the afternoon, they went to the cinema to watch a movie. On this very happy day, he lay in bed and fell into a deep sleep. He dreamed that the wolf king turned into the male lead in the play to fight a group of monkeys, and that the monkey king was Baldy Zhang in disguise. The two sides fought really hard, with a variety of tricks, which was extremely interesting. After many twists and turns, Little Slope felt that his body was about to fall into the sea! He woke up so scared, and the story ended.

Overall, the author's focus is on the "strange dream" in the second half. He uses a rich imagination to make the plot bizarre and tense, which is very fascinating. However, I prefer the previous description of Little Slope's many anecdotes in school and at home. The child's psychology is portrayed so delicately that every action and every word is lively on the paper, as if you had seen these children somewhere before, but you had forgotten them, and now their shadows are being found here again. Can you deny the author's painstaking efforts in conception? Originally, there is no need for me to say much about a great writer like Lao She, who is known for depicting personality, but I still have to nag because of my heartfelt joy and admiration!

"Little Slope's Birthday" is the best reading material for children. It can promote their imagination and nourish the development of children's spirituality. I would like parents and teachers to introduce it to your children and students. At the same time, for those who aspire to write children's books, this book is an indispensable reference.

Writing this, I can't help but think of a trivial matter from ten years ago: at that time, I was studying in the second year of junior high school, and Mr. Gao, the teacher who taught us Chinese, once included "Little Slope's Birthday" as one of the extracurricular reading books. Because the school library did not have this book, I chose another book to read later! But this relaxing name has not been forgotten. Until today, ten years later, when it is my turn to stand on the podium and introduce this fairy tale to a group of children, I have an unspeakable feeling. Is it remembering the kind Mr. Gao? Or cherishing the past life? Childhood has dissipated like smoke, but when did it begin?... You can't help but be amazed at the ruthlessness of the passing years... Until one day, one day you deliberately browse through a fairy tale read by children, you will truly appreciate its preciousness, and you will sincerely thank the author—because only he has been caring about you, and only he has left the most beautiful and kind dreams for you, when you are no longer a child.

### The Four Cornerstones of Peace

— Chu Yukun

Author: Mrs. Dean

Recently Published by McGraw-Hill Book Company

It has not been a full year since the end of World War II: the post-war world is full of devastation, and there is no talk of recovery and prosperity; but the crisis of a new international war is brewing again. We certainly do not want to be alarmist and say that World War III is just around the corner; but it can be said that "the war is over, but peace has not yet arrived," and we still have to strive for it.

Mrs. Dean, the author, is a first-class American female writer who has a good understanding of international issues. In addition to serving as a researcher at the American Foreign Policy Association, she also teaches international issues at various universities in the United States. She is proficient in six languages and has traveled all over the world. She has visited the Soviet Union, Germany, Finland, Norway, Switzerland, Austria, France, and various Latin American countries to conduct on-the-spot investigations of the political situation in various countries, which is of great benefit to her research on international issues.

Whether in her thoughts or actions, she is a typical American pacifist; on the one hand, she loves peace and does not want the United States to participate in the war again: on the other hand, she opposes isolationism. She says: "We all know now that if other countries in the world are destroyed by war or civil strife and threatened by famine, poverty, and disease, then we cannot enjoy peace and prosperity at home."

Her views on international politics are very correct.

She believes that the most important task facing mankind is to "complete peace." However, the demands of the people of all countries are, on the one hand, personal security, free from the threat of unemployment, and on the other hand, national security, free from foreign aggression. Therefore, in order to ensure their own security, all countries must strive for "safe zones," which instead cause international disturbances and unrest. Today's international crisis is latent in the struggle of all countries to strive for safe zones. But how can we eliminate today's international crisis? She proposes a concrete method, which is to take collective action, that is, to support the United Nations organization to maintain world peace. As for how international organizations can be effective? First, when international conflicts occur that are sufficient to cause war, the countries should immediately consult with each other to seek peaceful solutions. Second, international organizations must have troops that can stop aggression at any time.

Based on this belief, she studied international security and world peace; at the same time, based on this belief, she wrote this book "The Four Cornerstones of Peace" (The Four Cornerstones of Peace), which is divided into seven chapters:

(1) Introduction

(2) Dumbarton Oaks Conference

(3) Yalta Conference

(4) Mexico City Conference

(5) San Francisco Conference

(6) Potsdam and Beyond

(7) American Voters and International Organizations

There are also many important international documents attached, which are indeed available for reference in the study of international issues.

### About "About Women"

— Shi Jimei

In the past, I have read Bing Xin's novels, poems, essays,... I love her clear and detached writing style, poetic heart, and philosophy; like lyrical movements, the dongxiao flute on a peaceful lake and autumn moon night, elegant Chinese paintings, light strokes and light descriptions.

She loves nature, praises the sea, sings the praises of maternal love, has compassion, pity, and a compassionate heart, the most beautiful and perfect feelings. Her thoughts are like white doves flying in the clear sky, without the soaring of eagles, without the enthusiastic cries of cicadas in summer, but leaning towards the light, even making the beautiful blue sky more lovely.

This time, Bing Xin used the pen name and position of a "gentleman" to write "About Women." It is really superfluous to introduce such a good book as "About Women." I don't know how many readers have read it before me, and I don't know how many people have read it more than once like me, but I always feel that there is something to say, so I forgive my nosy.

This book has a total of sixteen sections, describing fourteen women of different identities and personalities. These fourteen women are the mothers, teachers, wet nurses, classmates, classmates, students, landlords, neighbors, helpers, wives and mothers of friends, and wives of younger brothers of a "gentleman who I respect and care for the most"... That "gentleman who I respect and care for the most" is the pseudonym and incarnation of Bing Xin. That gentleman is fictitious, because the "gentleman" himself is a lady. However, the fourteen women described in the book do not belong to nothingness. Yesterday, today, tomorrow, here, there, and in some more distant place, I have seen them, you have seen them, and they have all seen them...

Why use this pseudonym? Perhaps the author has more affectionate feelings when writing? Readers have more real feelings when reading? I think so?

These fourteen women are not amazingly talented, nor do they have great achievements. None of them are angels, and none of them are saints, but it can also be said that each of them is an angel, and each of them is a saint. The author writes in the "Postscript": "...Women seem to value the love of parents and children, the love of brothers and sisters, the love of husband and wife, the love of friends... She is willing to sacrifice everything for the object she loves. In fact, it is not a question of whether she is willing or not. She sacrifices unconditionally and loves without regard to consequences..." What is greater than sacrifice in the world? Unconditional sacrifice, selfless sacrifice, love first and then talk; not an angel is also an angel, not a saint is also a saint.

The lives of these fourteen women are like water flowing in a stream, flowing quietly; there are no heroic stories of raging waves, nor bizarre and winding fates. They live very plainly, but who can we deny? - That moving plainness is more moving than the winding movement. They naturally did not attract the broad attention of most people, but each of them has left the deepest eternal memory in the hearts of everyone who loves them. Their names are not left in history, but every smile and sigh of theirs is left in the memories of family and friends.

Of course, the author seems to have forgotten those bad, unkind, and evil women, but we must remember that the author of this book is a "gentleman who I respect and care for the most", so it is all biased towards the good side.

After reading "About Women", I feel that the elegant Chinese paintings are more fascinating, the sound of the flute on a moonlit night is particularly moving, and the music is more filled with many substantial emotions than before, the most precious things in life...

Finally, I want to quote what the author said in the postscript: "...She has more colors than men, and more sounds... If there were no women in the world, this world would at least lose five-tenths of "truth," six-tenths of "goodness," and seven-tenths of "beauty"... Is this right? Not to mention that I dare not say it, I dare not even ask it, and I dare not even think about it. I am nervously paranoid to guess that maybe Bing Xin had to use a pseudonym for these few words. I think the most appropriate answer should be the nodding or shaking of heads of gentlemen!

### Yang Zhixiong Come Out

— Shaofu

The Shanghai News Agency has a piece of news talking about Yang Zhixiong, the former chairman of the German Overseas Chinese Management Committee, being suspected of corruption and dereliction of duty. The argument of this news is as follows:

(1) Background: Yang Zhixiong once served as a compradore of the German Siemens Foreign Firm in this city for as long as twenty-five years. A few months before the victory, under the instigation of the German overseas Chinese, he went to the mainland to seek the official position of the German Overseas Chinese Management Committee. All the expenses were supplied by the German overseas Chinese, so after the victory, Yang was ordered to come to Shanghai to handle the affairs of the German Overseas Chinese Management, with great power in his hands, and everything went as he wished.

(2) Facts: The list of German overseas Chinese submitted by the German Consulate to Yang totaled 2,500 people. After examination and management, the number of German overseas Chinese was only more than 1,910, and after further review, more than 600 German overseas Chinese were approved to stay in China due to illness and other reasons, and only more than 800 were waiting to return home.

(3) Recent Result: The United States Associated Press spread the news that the Management Committee took the opportunity to extort gold bars and harbor Nazi elements.

Whether this news is true, we dare not make a hasty judgment at this time. If it is not, it is hoped that Yang Zhixiong will stand up immediately.

Otherwise, the authorities should thoroughly investigate to find out the truth.

We are not afraid of much corruption and much dereliction of duty. What we are afraid of is corruption and dereliction of duty without handling it, and without handling it thoroughly!

### 蠄蟝洞

— By Fang Jun

On the Aberdeen side of Hong Kong, amidst the shimmering green waves (only during clear, calm weather), there are more than just one "Qin Qu" caves, but outsiders are unable to find them. However, if one wishes to inquire like a fisherman, even an outsider can "look, inquire, and reach the destination" (though it doesn't actually have a door). In reality, the so-called "Qin Qu" cave is merely a symbolic term, not a real cave. However, the insult implied by this term is quite strong. Precisely because it is so strong, these so-called "Qin Qu" have a way to make a living.

Visiting "Qin Qu" caves is a kind of entertainment for the people of Hong Kong. The enjoyment and pleasure derived from it are quite different from those found in Tangxi, yet it shares similarities with the waters of Shau Kei Wan. However, Shau Kei Wan has a deterring aspect, due to the notorious presence of lurking leper women. In reality, who in Aberdeen dares to say that there are no hidden seeds of this terror? However, the environment there is somewhat better than that of Shau Kei Wan.

When I first arrived in Hong Kong, eight years ago, my relatives and friends, eager to fulfill their duty as hosts, took me to all the fun places in Hong Kong. Visiting "Qin Qu" caves was one of the items on the itinerary.

My close relative, Mr. Chen, was a leading broker in a foreign firm in Hong Kong, and also an expert in playing around in this mountain city. He had his own car, and could take me to play anywhere, no matter how far. One Sunday morning, he took me to Aberdeen to play, accompanied by one of his younger brothers and two close friends. He and those two friends addressed each other as brothers, and although they weren't sworn brothers, they were very close, practically business partners with shared interests. As for me, I only found them unbearably vulgar.

Aberdeen is famous in Hong Kong for its seafood. There are two restaurants there, one named "Zhen Nan" and the other "Lu Shan," both renowned for their seafood cuisine. Later, an old, dilapidated "Zi Dong" boat was transferred from the Pearl River, slightly repaired, and turned into a floating restaurant, stealing a lot of business from "Zhen Nan" and "Lu Shan."

That morning, we arrived in Aberdeen, parked the car under a large banyan tree, and walked towards an area by the sea where many Tanka women were standing. Seeing us approaching, the Tanka women raised their high-pitched voices and shouted at us. My close relative took the lead, choosing a young Tanka girl and asking to ride in her boat. She led us down to the boat and rowed us towards the green waves. In less than half an hour, we arrived at the so-called "Qin Qu" cave. An old, ugly woman emerged from the "Qin Qu" cave, shrilly calling "Young Master"... At the same time, a "Qin Qu," just one "Qin Qu," also emerged, a gaudily dressed woman with a giggling face.

The "Qin Qu" cave was just a medium-sized wooden boat. The "Qin Qu" were the water prostitutes there. A round awning covered the center, under which was the place for resting. Inside the cabin, on the side near the oar, there were layers of wooden shelves. On the shelves were shrines, mirrors, cups, plates, and miscellaneous items, all neatly arranged and exceptionally clean. We got on board from the small boat, climbed into the central cabin, took off our shoes, and sat on either side of the awning. The "Qin Qu" served clear tea, and my close relative busied himself with arranging the agenda. First, he ordered several "Qin Qu" to be summoned, one for each person. Second, he ordered a certain amount of opium (smoking paraphernalia readily available in the boat). Third, a set of mahjong tiles. Fourth, four kinds of seafood, along with soup, Yangzhou fried rice, and one pound of steamed pork. Once the program was set, he instructed the old, ugly woman to prepare it. My close relative and his two close friends started singing Tanka songs, while his younger brother teased the "Qin Qu."

One couldn't stand up inside the cabin. I was unfamiliar with everything, so I craned my neck to look at the green mountains and green waters. The green mountains were ever young, the mountain flowers were charming, and the old trees were lush, but the salty, fishy smell constantly assaulted my nostrils, making me feel that it was a pity. So I went out of the cabin, looking down at the green waves. Tiny, needle-like fish were chasing each other in groups in the green waves, making my hands itch. I took out a handkerchief, tied it into a net, and tried to scoop them up. However, although the fish were tiny, they were incredibly agile. After much effort, I managed to catch two, which jumped restlessly in the handkerchief net. I took them into the cabin, but no one gave them a second glance. The "Qin Qu" came over and said they were "groupers," less than a day old. I played with them for a while, then threw them back into the green waves. Two tiny splashes appeared on the surface of the sea, and then they disappeared.

Soon, "Qin Qu" arrived one after another from another small boat, crude, foolish, and obese, not worth a second glance, and their voices were croaking, deafening. After everyone had finished smoking opium and playing mahjong, the seafood was delivered from outside. Everyone was full and drunk, and the sun was setting. My legs were numb, and then the pain became unbearable. I thought to myself, curled up for half a day, with nowhere to stretch my legs, visiting "Qin Qu" caves was truly a great hardship. Although I didn't say it explicitly at the time, I dared not entertain the thought of being a "Liu Lang who crossed again" when my close relative invited me again later.

(Editor's Note) All "Qin Qu" have the insect radical.

### Seeking Love is Not a Crime

— By Xun Jie

July 1st News: Li Fukang, the principal of Wuxi Model Accounting Tutoring School, around thirty years old, wrote a love letter to a certain female student to court her. The female student read the letter aloud in public. Fearing that the situation would escalate, Li apologized to the students and wrote a confession. The students then sent five representatives to the education section of the county government to request an investigation, etc.

Although this matter is small, it concerns the dignity of teachers, the purity of education, and the priceless love in life! I personally have a few thoughts!

Speaking about the matter itself, a dignified principal, bearing the sacred mission of educating talents and saving social morals, should not rashly write a letter to a female student, whom he knows and who doesn't know him, to talk about love!

However, coming back to the point, humans are emotional beings. The feudal thoughts of the old society, such as "men and women should not touch hands when giving or receiving" and "should a brother-in-law extend a hand to help his drowning sister-in-law?" should have been broken in the new era!

Love has no class concept. As long as both parties agree and can truly love each other, whether teacher, student, rich, poor, noble, or lowly, there can be a possibility of a fulfilling union.

If Li's letter only expressed his inner admiration and the hope of slowly progressing from friendship, without any obscene words or threatening coercion, then this letter should not be regarded as an illegal or improper letter.

If Li has not been married, then he did not violate the law by writing a letter to a female student he admires to express his love. This letter is only a medium for soliciting the other party's opinion, with no malicious intent and no infringement on the other party's freedom!

The fact that he is a principal only means that he is more talented and knowledgeable than others. It cannot be said that just because he is a principal, he should give up on love. Moreover, he is legally and properly soliciting the other party's consent with a letter, which is not excessive. If he were not a principal, but a male classmate in his thirties, perhaps the female student who received this letter would treat it calmly.

When disagreeing with someone's reasonable request, it is enough to refuse them frankly. If someone expresses sincere admiration and expresses it frankly, not only is it rejected, but it is also made embarrassing and even thoroughly investigated, which, in my personal opinion, seems a bit too much.

In civilized countries, this kind of thing is not surprising, because in the civilized world, love is public, frank, and ardent. As long as it does not go beyond the legal track, expressing love to someone you admire is not a big deal. At the same time, the person being shown love also has the same freedom to accept or reject the love. On the contrary, they should even express gratitude to the person who admires her (or him), and if they cannot accept it, they should also politely decline.

Finally, I believe that the occurrence of this kind of thing is very natural, but the reason why it is shocking is still due to the lack of eradication of feudal thoughts in society. The fault is not with Li Fukang, nor with a certain female student, but with the remnants of feudal thoughts in the entire society!

### The Shortest Letter

— By Zhong Qi

"A British merchant, due to his busy schedule, wrote a letter to his son, who was studying in another city, telling him to keep his future letters as brief as possible. Soon, the merchant received a letter from his son:

S·O·S (Save Our Souls),

·S·D (Money),

RSVP (Répondez S'il Vous Plaît).

The letter contained only three sentences, and all used abbreviations, but the meaning was fully conveyed.

(Note) S·O·S· is the distress signal in telegraphy. ·S·D· represents pounds, shillings, and pence. RSVP means "please reply" and is commonly used on invitation cards."

### A Dentist Gets Rich but Blames Others for Corruption

— By Feng Yi

The American magazine "Life" reported: The corrupt atmosphere in China has affected the American staff working in China. A dentist, after arriving in China, found that the price of a set of dental equipment was more than ten times higher than in the United States. So, after making a fortune, he returned to the United States.

From this, we can see that one's reputation should not be "spoiled," otherwise other people's mistakes will be blamed on you. But how many people can fight for this and be able to have a clear conscience?

After a failed speculation, swindling gold bars and fleeing seems to have become a recent trend. The best way to punish them is to confine them in a gold vault, and wait until they are hungry and cannot eat, and cold and cannot wear clothes, and then see if they are still interested?

Glass belts, when they are worn around the waist, feel unbearably vulgar.

Shanghai's cholera, under the propaganda offensive, has not only not been deterred, but has become even more rampant. For these things, we hope that gentlemen will use their hands and not just their mouths.

Mayor Wu told reporters from the United Press that Shanghai's environment is not suitable for price controls. This is a sincere remark. Taking rice prices as an example, the black market price has indeed risen to 70,000 yuan.

Banned square-shaped publications are not all pornographic, and pornographic publications are not all square-shaped. This has the same principle as the fact that one cannot judge a person's character by their appearance.

Jeeps are not allowed to carry young women, but it is not said that young women cannot ride in jeeps. So not allowing them to be carried is one thing, and sitting is another.

### Reply to the Flies in the Countryside

— By Jin Kai

Dear flies in the countryside: We are very grateful that you care about our living situation! It is indeed very dangerous to live in the city. You really wouldn't believe it! We live here relatively safely and don't feel anything, although recently DDT has been attacking us, but we seem to be protected by God. No matter how strong the medicine is or how strict the orders are, I believe we will never be wiped out in the city. Now, I will report our living conditions to you, so you can broaden your horizons and avoid being "unnecessarily worried" about us.

DDT's attacks on us are undeniably powerful, but we always feel that it is only a temporary trend. Therefore, we are currently working in groups and areas. For example, there are the Yangshupu District, the Caishi Street District (semi-urban), the Caojiadu District, the Nanshi District, etc. The lifestyles of the brothers in each district are generally the same, so I will not describe them in detail by district. When we wake up every morning in a public toilet, we fly in teams to the nearby small vegetable market. It can be considered a large cafeteria there, with everything imaginable. Eating meat and fish is commonplace. What suits our appetite the most is the salted meat that the villagers bring to sell. They sell half a salted pig for several days, and we "definitely" eat some here and suck some there during these days, and the taste seems to get better every day. But some brothers are also tired of eating it. Confucius didn't know the taste of meat for three months, how lucky are we? There are more fish foods, like squid, freshwater shrimp, yellow croaker, and dead eel are all delicacies. Think about you only eating the leftovers from pig swill and the urine and feces in the cesspool, there is a huge difference compared to us! There are also freshly上市 Ningbo salted crabs and Jiangbei dried shrimps, which can't be said not to be our seasonal vegetables! The most comfortable thing is that after we are full, we can take a nap on the chopping board in the butcher shop. The weather is hotter in the afternoon than in the morning, so we walk along the road, looking around. We see a banner on the road that says "Cholera is there every year, especially this year." We are so encouraged, because it gives us clear evidence of a busy and hard work! We fly along the road more and more happily, and we feel hot too. It doesn't matter, the good thing is that there are cold drink stalls along the way. We can also dip our lips in the leftover or completely uneaten milk, shaved ice juice, lemonade, etc. from people, and sweeten our mouths. A kind of fragrant aroma, I'm afraid you would also be drooling! In the evening when the sun sets, it is the time when we are tired of traveling and think about returning home; we casually find a hotel on the way home. We don't dare to taste the wine, but smelling the wine is also a romantic thing. In addition, the cooked meat stalls in front of the hotel are also our dining room. Pork head meat, smoked fish, roast duck, soy sauce chicken, deep-fried shrimp, five-spice beef... which one is not a top-class dish? You say our eating fortune is good, but you will probably be speechless when you see this letter! It's getting dark, we go home with a drunk feeling and look for dreams, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow... we live steadily day after day like this, what's not happy? You tell me! A related report is that in addition to the above-mentioned foods, we can also bravely fly to the most lively downtown area to taste the taste of starving people's meat! You invite us to play in the countryside, but it is better for us to welcome you to visit here. Goodbye, I wish you a pleasant time! Yours sincerely, The Flies in the City

### Lament for My Youngest Son, Zaisen

— By Han Sou, Aged Sixty-Eight

Your surname is Zhang, your given name Zaisen, you are from Chuansha County, Jiangsu. Your father, Zhihe, was a student. At the beginning of the Republic, he entered the Jiangsu Provincial Government, serving in education and civil administration successively, known for his integrity and incorruptibility. The establishment of new undertakings in Chuansha was largely due to his efforts. Your mother, Tang, gave birth to you in the northern township of Chuansha in the twelfth year of the Republic. After completing primary school, you entered the Shanghai Private Zhengshi Middle School. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Battle of Shanghai was fought bitterly for three months, but ultimately the city could not be defended. Young people sacrificed their lives for the country, one falling after another. You were greatly angered. At that time, you were a second-year student at a senior high school. You gave up your studies, left your family, and went to the interior, where you passed the entrance examination for the Artillery Department of the Chengdu Central Military Academy. In May of the thirty-first year of the Republic, you participated in the Jin-Qu Campaign as the commander of the mortar platoon in the Second Battalion, 314th Regiment, 105th Division of the Army. At first, you suffered setbacks and retreated. Later, you counterattacked, recovered Jiangshan, took Quzhou, and Longyou, confronting the enemy on the outskirts of Jinhua City. On the twenty-fifth day of September, a Mid-Autumn Festival moonlit night, you fought your way to Bailongqiao, thirty miles west of Jinhua City. As dawn approached, you were surrounded by an enemy army with overwhelming superiority. Unwilling to surrender, you committed suicide. You were twenty-one years old.

Alas, my son Zaisen, you have become a martyr for the country, and your ambition has been fulfilled. The Japanese invaders have finally surrendered, and you can be comforted. When you were about to graduate from military academy, you wrote in a letter that your body already belonged to the country. I did not possess such a son, but a selfish man of one family. In the past, Jian Shu's son was with the army, and he cried when he sent him off, saying that he would collect your bones. But when you left, on May 1, the 27th year of the Republic, you left without saying goodbye. At first, the family thought you were missing, but I was happy that you had ambition, hoping that you would return in glory. But now it is over, and there is no way to collect your bones, so what else can I say? You are my third son. Those who cast my horoscope have said that I would have two or three sons, or that I would have three sons, and that two sons would see me off in my final days. I hated it very much. When you were three years old, my younger brother Zhihu passed away without a son, and you were adopted as his heir, which seemed to confirm what was said before. But who knew that there was still more to come? You sent a letter from Pucheng County, Fujian, on July 12 of the thirty-first year of the Republic. After that, there was not a single word. Until now, in the spring of the thirty-fifth year of the Republic, more than half a year after the surrender of the enemy, I still have not received definite news of you, and my heart is confused. Occasionally, in a pile of old papers, I found a piece of paper casting your horoscope, saying that at seventeen you would enter the Yi-Mao luck, and a big circle was drawn, saying that you could be earth-shattering, and after that there would be no more black dots, indicating that your life would end. Then I realized that you must have died. Sure enough, on a certain day in March, I received a pension document, waking me from a three- or four-year dream. And according to the previous and subsequent horoscopes, is it credible? According to the investigation, you died in battle on September 25 of the thirty-first year of the Republic, which is the sixteenth day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar. The counterattack on Jinhua was 16th day of the first month of the twelfth year of the Republic, that is, the thirtieth day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar, and you had not yet reached the age of twenty. According to the lunar calendar, you were twenty-one years old. You, the adopted son of my younger brother, died at the age of twenty-three. Your life was even shorter. My younger brother worked at the arsenals in the three northeastern provinces. You graduated from the sixteenth class of the Artillery Department of the Central Military Academy, went to the front line to resist the enemy, and reached the rank of captain in the army, belonging to the Second Battalion, 314th Regiment, 105th Division, commanding the mortar platoon. Both generations tested their talents for the first time, and then died young. Heaven, what is my love guilty of, that the misfortune extends to the younger branch, and that it is stingy with its sacrifices? I will tell your two older brothers that they should also establish an heir for you in the future, to extend the sacrifices of my younger brother and to comfort his spirit. If you have knowledge, please tell them, alas.

### A Traitor's Door Produces a Filial Daughter Who Can Be Filial but Cannot Be Loyal

— By Wuling Ren

Jiang Zhaoju, the daughter of the North China traitor Jiang Kanghu, insisted on entering the prison to serve her father, who was in custody and ill. Because she was not allowed, she even refused to eat or sleep, crying outside the courtyard all day long and waving her away. The warden was moved by her, and only then allowed her to enter the prison twice a day to serve medicine and food, so as to fulfill her filial piety. It is rare that a filial daughter is actually produced by the door of a traitor. It is a pity that she knows the great righteousness of ethics and morality, but she could not make a remonstrance when Jiang went against the country, so as to prevent her father from becoming a criminal of the country and nation. If not only filial piety, but also loyalty, it would not be necessary to cry and seek to enter the prison to serve medicine and food today.

After Chen Gongbo was shot, recently a young man went to the Suzhou Funeral Home to write a memorial essay for him, and left in a hurry after the ceremony. Those who saw his memorial essay only signed the word "Yu," and no one knew who he was. This is exactly what is called "a stranger hangs for the dead, but the dead can't tell."

In the major corruption case of the Lianglu Administration, the main culprit was a woman—the wife of the director of the materials department, who is still at large. The reason for the major corruption was that the director's soul fell into the hands of the wife's party. The reason why the wife incited her husband to commit adultery and violate the law is speculated to be because she has an opium addiction, and the salary income of the road bureau is limited, so she cannot be as happy as she wants. When Director Chen Bozhuang summoned more than 300 employees for a speech, he said that the treatment of employees has been adjusted to ensure that the minimum living standards of employees are resolved. In order to maintain the integrity of public officials, it is necessary to stabilize their lives first; but if you take the salary that is only enough to maintain the minimum living standards, but want to enjoy extra benefits, then you will never be able to do it well. This couple of the materials department probably made this point.

The people of Hiroshima are talking about nuclear weapons. The United Nations observers all felt disappointed with this time. The Soviet professor shrugged and said: "It's nothing." This is the different feeling between the victim and the by stander.
