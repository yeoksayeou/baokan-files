Lin Bin presided over the meeting. Shao Lizi, the originally nominated chairman, only participated with his opinions from the side because of a sore throat. After the meeting began, Sun Ke, representing the Presidium, first explained the nature and execution of the draft Constitution review work on behalf of the Presidium, and then left. Chairman Lin then reported on the tea party hosted by the Presidium for the conveners of the review committees on the afternoon of the 8th, as well as various decisions. Immediately, the issue of the quorum of the Review Committee sparked a wave of discussion. Representatives generally believed that one-tenth was too few and lacked solemnity. After a vote, it was passed by an overwhelming majority of 150 votes that at least one-quarter of the representatives must be present for the meeting to be held. Shao Lizi left at 4:30 PM. The election of two representatives to participate in the "Comprehensive" Review Committee began, and the meeting adjourned at 4:50 PM after designated vote counters were chosen.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Third Review Committee of the National Assembly's draft Constitution review committee held a meeting at 10 AM on the 9th in the lounge on the second floor of the National Assembly Hall, chaired by Pan Gongzhan. Conveners Wang Chonghui, Wang Shijie, and Jiang Yuntian all attended. When the meeting was announced, there were 84 representatives present. Subsequently, a total of 139 people arrived. The chairman first reported that 100 proposals related to the Third Review Committee had been received in the morning, and then reported on the cases related to Chapter Four, requesting the representatives to discuss them in order. As soon as this announcement was completed, Chen Changheng, Chen Qianxi, Cheng Cangbo, Liu Butong, Zhou Yiyun, Chen Guyuan, and others made relevant speeches. After the representatives expressed their opinions, the chairman declared: If Chapter Four to Chapter Nine are merged, this would be a change to the content of the review and should be submitted to the Comprehensive Review Committee for discussion. Today, we should still discuss the original scope in order. At the same time, Liu Butong stated that this kind of principle issue cannot be debated in this way. If the principle issue is discussed first, theoretical issues will arise again, and the meeting will not be able to continue, and he proposed that the meeting be adjourned immediately. Regarding the third opinion, the chairman explained that the conveners only received the fourth opinion before the meeting. The chairman reported that it was the Presidium's decision, but because there were many opinions at the time, the chairman put it to a vote, and the majority voted in favor of one-quarter being the quorum. Finally, the chairman announced that it was decided that the conveners would be responsible for determining the meeting schedule before each review meeting, and classifying the relevant proposals before submitting them for discussion. The meeting is now adjourned. The conveners will meet in the afternoon. The meeting adjourned at 11:20 AM. The meeting did not address the main topic from beginning to end, and the speeches and discussions were quite complicated. Fortunately, the chairman handled it in an orderly manner, resulting in a satisfactory conclusion.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Third Review Committee held a meeting of conveners at 3 PM this afternoon. Except for Representative Wang Chonghui, the other eight people attended. Hosted by Representative Pan Gongzhan, they focused on actively classifying and organizing the proposals and extensive opinions in a quiet atmosphere, and dispersed only at dusk.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] In addition to the previously nominated Zeng Qi and Jiang Yuntian as representatives to participate in the Comprehensive Review Committee, on the 9th, the conveners of the Third Review Committee mutually nominated Pan Gongzhan and Shi Shangkuan as representatives to participate in the Comprehensive Review Committee, and in accordance with the notification method of the Secretariat, designated Pan Gongzhan to maintain close contact with the Presidium at all times.

### Fourth Review Committee Divides into Three Groups for Discussion

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The third meeting of the Fourth Review Committee of the draft Constitution was held at the Public Recreation Association at 9:40 AM on the 9th. Chairman Li Zhongxiang first reported that Representative Zhang Gai proposed changing the first sentence of Article 82 of the draft Constitution, "The Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial organ of the state," to "The Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial organ of the state." The participating representatives unanimously agreed and revised the original record. Yang Yifeng and others requested that, because the scope of the review was too broad, the judiciary, examination, and supervision should first be divided into three groups for preliminary review in accordance with Article 4 of the Review Committee Organization Law, and then a full group review meeting should be convened to make the final decision on the review. This was unanimously agreed, and the representatives immediately freely determined which group or groups they wanted to join.

### Central and Local Authority: Groups Five and Six Will Jointly Review

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Fifth Review Committee of the draft Constitution held its second meeting at the Public Recreation Association at 3 PM on the 9th, chaired by Huang Jilu. The chairman reported on the discussion of the draft regulations for the review process, and the election of Li Zonghuang, Shi Zizhou, Li Shizhen, Zhang Honglie, and Wang Xuhui as members of the Compilation Committee, followed by a discussion of the review principles of Chapter Ten of the draft Constitution. The first item was to determine the principles for the division of authority between the central and local governments, which was divided into three items: (1) a system of divided powers, (2) a system of centralized powers, and (3) a system of balanced powers. The chairman reported that, according to the Preliminary of People's Rights, the last item should be put to a vote first. With 43 people present, it passed by an overwhelming majority of 34 votes. The system of balanced powers between the central and local governments was then discussed in detail. Wang Zhengting, Shi Zishu, Xu Xiaoyan, Liu Jiu, Wu Tianzhen, and others spoke, with most representatives advocating a three-level system of balanced powers, that is, the division of powers between the central government and the provinces, and between the provinces and the counties. At 5:20 PM, Wang Yunwu, dispatched by the Presidium, arrived to explain the original intent of the draft Constitution. Regarding the issue of authority between local and central governments, the draft Constitution adopted a listing approach, and at that time it was believed that the authority of the third level, namely the county, did not need to be stipulated in the Constitution, because the county is a constituent part of the province, and because the level of education in each county is different, there cannot be a fixed regulation. Representative Xu Xiaoyan believed that if the county is to carry out affairs, it must be given the power to legislate on its own in order to exert its abilities. After two hours of discussion on the issue of authority between local and central governments, it was decided that because it was related to Chapter Six on county autonomy, the Presidium representative Wang Yunwu should be asked to convey to the Presidium that a joint review meeting should be held with the Sixth Review Committee. The issue of county autonomy was then discussed.

### Sixth Review Committee Passes Review Procedures

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Sixth Review Committee of the draft Constitution was held at the Second National Assembly Guest House at 3 PM on the 9th. Sixty-four representatives attended, chaired by Zheng Yanqi. The chairman reported that the General Assembly Presidium received a total of 412 proposals, of which 37 were related to this committee, and were now generally divided into nine categories. Jiang Yuntian was also recommended by the Presidium to this group to explain Chapter Eleven. Jiang then explained the drafting process of Chapter Eleven, saying that the division of this chapter had been carefully considered. It was originally stipulated that the provincial autonomy law should be formulated by the provincial people of each province, but it was feared that the customs and habits of the people in various places would be different, and that the regulations of each province would be too far apart, causing difficulties for the central government in implementing laws and decrees. Therefore, this chapter was formulated. After Jiang left the meeting, the chairman announced the draft review procedures decided by the conveners' meeting of this group in the morning. Immediately, a representative proposed that the proposals should be sorted and classified before discussion. It was decided that the conveners and the secretary would be responsible for sorting them out. There were no objections to the review procedures, and they were passed. Finally, 37 relevant proposals were read out, and the meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.

### Seventh Review Committee Divides Work into Four Subgroups

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] After discussing the matter in the morning, the conveners of the Seventh Review Committee of the draft Constitution convened a plenary meeting at the assembly hall at 3:30 PM on the 9th. 188 representatives attended, including Chen Guofu, Li Weiguo, Zhu Jiasheng, Fu Sinian, Xiong Zhiyi, and Dengzhunasan. The originally nominated chairman Tudan Sangbu did not attend due to business, and Xie Chengping presided over the meeting instead. First, it was decided to divide the review work into four subgroups: the first subgroup on national defense and foreign affairs, the second subgroup on national economy, the third subgroup on education and culture, and the fourth subgroup on social security and health administration. After each representative sat and signed in according to their group, the election of two conveners for each subgroup was conducted. The result was Wang Bianlai and Liu Zhendong for the first subgroup, Zhu Jiahua and Hu Shuhua for the third subgroup, and Gu Zhenggang and Hu Ding'an for the fourth subgroup. There was a break from 4:30 PM to 4:40 PM. After the Review Committee and the conveners of each subgroup gathered to discuss, Chairman Xie reported on three matters: (1) Secretary Chuqing Shao Representative Lizi to regularly serve as the reporter for the part of the Constitution related to the Seventh Review Committee, (2) 148 opinions and 421 proposals in 9 volumes that need to be submitted for review have been received and distributed, and group research will begin both in the morning and afternoon from the 10th. (3) At 5 PM on the afternoon of the 10th, the Review Committee and the conveners of each subgroup will meet to discuss the overall progress of the Review Committee's work. The meeting adjourned at 4:50 PM.

### Based on Recent Trends, the Draft Constitution May Have Revisions, and Some Articles Will Adopt a Compromise Approach

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] In addition to the draft Constitution proposed by the government, the National Assembly has 421 proposals from representatives, which have been printed and distributed to the review committees on the 9th. They are now stepping up the sorting, review, and exchange of opinions from all parties. Based on recent trends, the government's original draft Constitution may have some revisions. Important issues are as follows:

(1) Regarding Article 1 on the form of government, some people advocate using the "Three Principles of the People Republic" in the original draft Constitution of the May 5th Constitution, but a compromise opinion may revise it to "Three Principles of the People Democratic Republic."

(2) The capital may maintain the government's original proposal, and Article 7, which stipulates that the capital is Nanjing, may be deleted, and the article will not be stipulated in the Constitution.

(3) The issue of territorial changes will be revised to stipulate that it cannot be changed without a resolution of the National Assembly.

(4) The organization of the National Assembly, members of the Legislative Yuan, and members of the Control Yuan may not concurrently serve as representatives of the National Assembly. The members of the Control Yuan may be elected by the National Assembly, and those elected are not limited to representatives of the National Assembly.

(5) The National Assembly representatives may adopt both regional elections and occupational elections at the same time. At the same time, the number of representatives that ethnic minorities should elect will be stipulated by law.

(6) The National Assembly's powers may be increased to include the election and recall of the president, vice president, and central government officials, the revision of the constitution, and the initiation of central laws.

(7) The National Assembly may be changed to meet once every three years, and the National Assembly meetings may be changed to be convened by the president or convened by the representatives of a certain number of National Assembly.

(8) The members of the Legislative Yuan will still be directly elected by each region in proportion to the population. (9) If the appointment of the President of the Executive Yuan requires the consent of the Legislative Yuan, the number of times consent is required may be limited.

(10) If the Legislative Yuan disagrees with the Executive Yuan on important bills and policies, the Legislative Yuan may request the President of the Executive Yuan to resign, and the Executive Yuan may also request the President to dissolve the Legislative Yuan for re-election or convene the National Assembly for a referendum. (11) The President of the Judicial Yuan, the Grand Justices, the President of the Examination Yuan, and the members of the Examination Committee may still be nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Control Yuan, but some also advocate that the power of consent be exercised solely by the Legislative Yuan. (12) The audit of the final accounts and the audit work may still belong to the Control Yuan. (13) The autonomous status of ethnic minorities in the border areas and the development of the economy and education in the border areas may be specially stipulated in the chapter on basic national policies.

(14) The articles in the chapter on basic national policies will be added to or deleted. Those related to economy, education, and culture must be enriched, but it is not yet certain whether they will be listed as separate chapters.

(15) In the election chapter, it may be stipulated by law that women should elect a certain number of National Assembly representatives and members of the Legislative Yuan.

(16) After the constitution is promulgated and before it is implemented, there must be transitional measures. The National Assembly may formulate a law on the procedures for implementing constitutional government to provide the National Government with a basis for implementation on the eve of implementation of the law.

### The Government Considers Sending Personnel to Yan'an in Order to Restore Peace Talks; Reports that Eight Ministers of the Executive Yuan Will Be Transferred Are Inaccurate

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Foreign Ministry spokesman Ye Gongchao declared at a press conference of the Central Propaganda Department on the afternoon of the 9th: The government is considering sending representatives to Yan'an to consult with the Communist Party on restoring negotiations. It has not yet been decided who will be sent by Huanfu. Ye's remarks were in response to a reporter's question about whether it was true that the government would send Minister Wang Shijie to Yan'an as a prelude to restoring negotiations. The reporter also asked whether it was true that the National Assembly would be extended again due to the above relationship. Ye avoided answering. Another reporter asked whether it was reliable that eight ministers would be transferred to the position of provincial governor and that their vacancies would be filled by third-party figures. Ye said: "I have not heard of this." The reporter asked what proposals the representative would bring if the government sent a representative to Yan'an. Ye said: "You can ask the representative in the future." Because the reporter did not get the main point of Ye's reply, he turned to ask Minister Peng. Peng said: "Some people believe that according to the new organization law of the Executive Yuan, eight new ministries will be added, and therefore believe that these eight ministries will be filled by third parties, and the original ministers will be transferred to the position of provincial governor. This kind of thinking is too "mathematical" and is therefore inaccurate." After the meeting, Peng told reporters that the government has "no specific plan" for sending a representative to Yan'an. A reporter asked whether the "ministers would be happy to go." Peng smiled without answering.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] It has been rumored in Beijing in recent days that a senior official will be sent to Yan'an. The newspaper reported on the 9th that the candidate might be Wang Shijie. The reporter made a special trip to visit and inquire on the morning of the 9th. Wang firmly stated: "I will definitely not go. As for whether someone else will go, I don't know." According to the reporter's inquiry, Zhang Zhizhong is very likely to go. As for the rumor about Shao Lizi, Shao himself has firmly denied it.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Wang Bingnan of the Communist Party Office told reporters tonight: The two demands put forward by the Communist Party in its previous letter to Ambassador Marshall are consistent positions that have never changed and will not change in the future. If the government cannot accept these two demands, peace talks cannot be reopened. Wang also said: He received a telegram from Yan'an tonight stating that eleven regiments of Hu Zongnan's troops are advancing towards Liulin. The consequences of continuing this kind of warfare are unimaginable. The reporter then asked whether the Communist Party welcomed the government's sending a senior official to Yan'an. Wang replied that they had not received any notification. At the same time, peace talks must be based on the two aforementioned demands.

### Ambassadors Marshall and Stuart Have a Long Talk and Continue to Mediate Behind the Scenes

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Ambassador Marshall visited Ambassador Stuart at 11 AM on the 9th for a long talk. Stuart went out with Chuan Jingbo in the evening. It is believed that Marshall and Stuart are still making strong behind-the-scenes mediation for China's peace.

### Special Notes on the Draft Constitution Review Meeting

— Our Reporters Zhang Ming, De, and Yu Zhenji

The Third Review Committee was the most exciting and the most representative of the spirit of democracy among the meetings this morning. Chairman Pan Gongzhan remained calm and handled the situation in an atmosphere of back-and-forth remarks. A reporter said: "Mr. Pan is always smiling today."

The most frequent speakers were the members of the Legislative Yuan, including Chen Changheng, Chen Guyuan, Liu Butong, and others, each with their own merits. Chen Changheng first said that the principle was a matter of principle, and then Liu Butong said that it was now a matter of principle, and that it would be a matter of theory later, and that if the discussion continued in this way, it would not get to the main topic and should be adjourned. Then Chen Changjiu immediately stood up and said: "I am not explaining theory..." This was very exciting and fully demonstrated the spirit of the Legislative Yuan.

Chen Qianxi was the first to speak today. Before the meeting was announced, after reporting that the number of attendees was 84, which was sufficient for a quorum, he stood up and opened fire, loudly questioning: "Who decided that? Eighty-four people is enough for a quorum?" The convener's reply was: "The Presidium decided." Chen fired again: "Who stipulated this? Why is it stipulated like this? It's outrageous!" This quarrel was able to proceed only after the chairman gave a slight explanation, but this undercurrent still existed. After discussing for a while, it was raised again, and Cheng Cangbo also stood up and said: "This is not a problem for our group alone, but for the entire body."

Chen Qianxi spoke many times and argued repeatedly. After one of his speeches, the chairman declared: According to Article 7 of the National Assembly Organization Law, there should be a limit on the time and number of speeches, and Chen temporarily stopped.

The Seventh Review Committee was presided over by Xie Chengping of the Youth Party, whose attitude was open-minded, flexible, and said "Representative Mr. So-and-so," "Your group," "Please the staff member of the venue," and so on. The move to divide the lines and sit first, then group and then sign in was clear and orderly, making people call it "wonderful."

When the National Economic Subgroup was electing a convener, someone nominated Wang Xiaolai. Wang, wearing a melon-skin felt hat and with a round face, stood up and said loudly: "Please pay attention, Chairman, Wang Xiaolai does not want to be elected." When the Education and Culture Subgroup nominated Zhu Jiahua, Zhu also stood up and said: "I am currently in charge of educational administration and it is inconvenient to be a convener." Chairman Xie replied separately that the opinions of the meeting should be respected and no more should be said. As a result, both of them were still elected.

Among the four subgroups of the Seventh Review Committee, the National Economy and Education and Culture subgroups had the most people, while the National Defense and Foreign Affairs and Social Security and Health Administration subgroups had very few. There were a total of nineteen female representatives present, and the number of them was: ten in the Education and Culture Subgroup, five in the National Economy Subgroup, four in the Social Security and Health Administration Subgroup, and none in the National Defense and Foreign Affairs Subgroup. People listening in said: "Look, the women's community does not want national defense and foreign affairs." In fact, 70% of those sitting in the seats of the National Defense and Foreign Affairs Subgroup were national guards in red-striped yellow wool coats.

Although Gu Zhenggang did not attend the Seventh Review Committee on the 9th, his popularity surpassed every representative who attended. He was often elected convener by the most votes in the National Economy Subgroup and the Social Security and Health Administration Subgroup. The two groups competed for him, and Chairman Xie said: "Representative Gu should be asked to choose himself." Chuan Sinian said: "Representative Gu is the proposer of the social security case and should be assigned to the Social Security and Health Administration Subgroup." Therefore, the Social Security Subgroup warmly applauded his welcome. Liu Zhendong filled the position of convener of the National Economy Subgroup with the second most votes.

Yu Bin Recommends Taixu Master as the National Assembly's Buddhist Representative

A reporter asked Yu Bin what was the reason for recommending Taixu Master as a representative of social elites? Yu replied: "This gentleman has great political wisdom and is a representative figure among monks. The number of monks in our country is considerable, totaling nearly one million. During the Anti-Japanese War, they were born and died to serve the country. After Taixu is their representative, their opinions can be conveyed through him."

Some asked why a monk who has become a monk should care about worldly affairs? He replied: "Although a monk has become a monk, he has not left the country." After he finished speaking, the Chinese reporters were greatly surprised. Bishop Yu spoke humorously and had no missionary habits. He himself is a member of the National Assembly Presidium, but he humbly said that the work of the Presidium is only to look at the clock for the representatives, and his task is equivalent to that of a waiter or errand boy.

National Assembly Representative Zhi Chaoying worked as Yu's interpreter, and Yu also answered in his Northeastern English. However, after mistakenly reading the English word "autonomy" as "astronomy," he quickly corrected it. The reception lasted for two hours and answered nearly 20 questions. However, the most notable one was Ye Gongchao. Regarding the government's sending a representative to Yan'an, the reporter, after listening to the eight religious issues, heard this answer and frantically wrote it down, fearing to miss a single word. The minister refused to announce anything about sending a representative to Yan'an. A reporter asked three questions, but he did not answer them and showed a small piece of paper, saying: "I have another appointment." After he finished speaking, he suddenly left. (December 9)

### The Government Has Not Yet Closed the Door to Peace Negotiations; the Chairman Declared at the Memorial Week

[China Decisive News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] The memorial week of the central authorities and the memorial of the Zhaohe warship uprising were held jointly at the National Government at 8:30 AM today. Chairman Jiang personally presided over the meeting and delivered a training speech. First, he described the process of the Yanhe uprising in the fourth year of the Republic of China, followed by the relationship of this uprising. The revolutionary cause of the party is very important, and he said that the revolution is not afraid of failure, and must have the spirit of persevering in sacrifice and struggle. The chairman expressed his gratification with the smooth progress of the National Assembly, and encouraged the representatives to formulate a democratic constitution and complete the mission of constitution-making. Regarding domestic issues, the chairman also said that the government has never closed the door to peace negotiations, and has consistently advocated resolving the issue through political means.

### Yu Bin Discusses the Constitution

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 9th Dispatch] Yu Cheng, one of the members of the National Assembly Presidium and Bishop, stated at a press conference held by the Central Propaganda Department this afternoon, the 9th: The current draft of the Constitution is the result of incorporating and harmonizing the opinions of various parties and factions. Although it is not the most ideal, it is superior to the "May 5th Draft". He, standing from the National Assembly's position, expressed satisfaction with it.

Regarding previous reports that Cardinal Tian Gengxin would come out to form a political party, Mr. Yu solemnly stated that this was absolutely untrue. The idea of a bishop forming a political party is unheard of, whether in China or abroad, in ancient or modern times.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 9th Dispatch] External Affairs Spokesman Ye Gongchao stated: The Chinese government only recognizes one authority in Vietnam, namely the French authority. The Chinese Central Government has not established diplomatic relations with the Viet Minh. However, the representatives of China stationed in Vietnam have sometimes had de facto contact with local authorities. The Chinese government is deeply concerned about the safety of overseas Chinese in Haiphong, Saigon, and other places in Vietnam, and has made representations to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Paris to provide concrete protection. Some time ago, the Central Government suggested to both the French and Vietnamese sides to demarcate a clear-cut Chinese neutral zone in Haiphong, which neither the French nor the Vietnamese sides would be allowed to use as a base of operations. However, in the past three or four days, the situation in Haiphong has gradually improved, and the Viet Minh forces have successively withdrawn from the city, so the establishment of a neutral zone may no longer be necessary. However, since the lives and property of Chinese people have repeatedly suffered losses, it is still extremely concerned about the situation. Mr. Ye then cited examples of the illegal interference by the French military and political authorities in the activities of Chinese businessmen in Saigon, and said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has made representations to the French Embassy in China. Mr. Ye further said: It is heard that the French authorities are levying a head tax on overseas Chinese in Saigon, while the Vietnamese do not bear this type of tax. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is investigating and verifying this report, because according to the Sino-French agreement signed in Chongqing this year, local governments cannot levy taxes on overseas Chinese that are higher than those levied on Vietnamese. Regarding the negotiations on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, Mr. Ye said that according to the agreement, the section of the railway within Yunnan Province should be returned to China unconditionally, and the technical issues of the handover are being studied. He did not believe that the Sino-French negotiations were hindered by the reorganization of the French government, and said that experts are currently investigating the losses suffered by Chinese public and private interests in Vietnam.

### Soviet News Agency Publishes Commentary Attacking the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty

[United Press, Moscow, 8th Dispatch] Izvestia columnist Belefutai Luo attacked the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty today, referring to it as giving the United States dominance over China's economy through treaty clauses and placing China under the control of American monopoly capital. It is claimed that the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty was signed before the opening of the National Assembly, indicating that the United States supports the Kuomintang government and strengthens its position in foreign policy. The CCP did not participate in the convocation of the National Assembly. The ruling class of the United States hopes that China will enact legislation through a one-party government to legitimize the stationing of U.S. troops in China, saying that it comes from the invitation of a legitimate government. However, if the Kuomintang government does not respond to the CCP's demands to resume negotiations and form a coalition government, China's political crisis will inevitably deepen.

[United Press, Nanjing, 9th Dispatch] A government spokesman today criticized the Izvestia article attacking the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty, saying that the rights given to the United States by China are no more than those given to any other country. The Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty is based on the principle of most-favored-nation treatment and equality, allowing the United States to trade in China only on a reciprocal basis. Although some countries have not yet benefited from the provisions of the Commercial Treaty, they will still fully enjoy its benefits in the future.

They will determine their next course of action after the situation is clarified and instructions are requested, and another diplomatic procedure may be required.

### During the Haiphong French-Vietnamese Military Conflict, More Than 500 Overseas Chinese Were Killed or Injured; Property Losses Reached 100 Million Vietnamese Currency

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 9th Dispatch] According to news obtained here, during the eight days of the French-Vietnamese military conflict in Haiphong last month, overseas Chinese in Vietnam suffered losses of up to 100 million Vietnamese currency, with more than 500 people killed or injured, 1500 missing, and 400 homeless. The Vietnamese military destroyed reservoirs, so the drinking water problem is currently serious, but it is expected to be repaired within February. Half of Haiphong was destroyed in the conflict between the two armies. French people are now occupying Haiphong City, while the Vietnamese people have withdrawn to the suburbs with the Vietnamese army. The war broke out on November 20 due to the French military transporting Vietnamese police to suppress riots. A batch of French troops inspected a gasoline-carrying steamship, which the Vietnamese considered an infringement of their sovereignty, and they immediately opposed it. As a result, street fighting broke out. The French military used tanks and artillery, while the Vietnamese army only used pistols, machine guns, and grenades. Overseas Chinese attempted to hang national flags on the roofs to mark their identities, but were obstructed by Vietnamese soldiers, who threatened them with death and forced them to take them down. The French used warships to provide large-scale reinforcements and used airplanes to bomb Vietnamese military strongholds. Several places caught fire, but fortunately, Chinese organizations extinguished the fire. It is said that the situation in Haiphong is still tense.

### Land Transportation Inside and Outside the Pass; Several Issues Expected to be Resolved; Vehicles to be Repaired at Tangshan Factory

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 9th Dispatch] Several issues regarding railway transportation inside and outside the Pass have been partially resolved due to the trip of Shi Zhiren, Director of the Pingjin Railway Bureau, to the Northeast. (1) The Northeast Railway's Huangguantun Machine Factory lacks electricity and cannot start work, and the Dalian Shakoukou Machine Factory has not yet been taken over by us, so thousands of vehicles waiting for repair cannot be repaired. It has now been decided to hand over 800 of them to the Tangshan Machine Factory in the Pingjin area for gradual repair. The Tangshan Machine Factory can now repair 40 locomotives and 200 passenger and freight cars per month, but materials are extremely scarce, and the Japanese materials received have almost been used up, which is a serious problem for the future. (2) There are several inspection agencies in the Pingjin area and Shanhaiguan, such as the Northeast Xingyuan Commander's Office and the Customs. Due to complicated procedures, freight cars often stay for several days before being released after arrival. Shi Zhiren has also suggested simplifying the inspection procedures, which has been agreed to by the Northeast authorities. Shi Zhiren will report to Beijing on the 10th to solve the problems of funding and material scarcity. (3) Because one Beining Road is under the management of two road administrations, and Shanhaiguan also has its own stations, it has been decided to unify operations and increase efficiency this time.

The speech ended at 11:40 AM, and all the students were extremely grateful.

### Guangdong's Five-Year Construction Plan; All Drafts Completed After Eight Months of Preparation; Focusing on the Economy, Striving for Sufficient Food and Clothing

[Our Newspaper Guangzhou, 9th Dispatch] Guangdong Province's five-year construction plan has been in the works for eight months, involving over one hundred experts and detailed discussions by the Provincial Administrative Council and the Provincial Assembly, and has now been fully drafted. This plan focuses on the economy, first developing agriculture and industry, and will establish 80 public factories to ensure that the people of the province have sufficient food and clothing. In terms of culture, it will eliminate 80% of illiteracy, while cultivating and guaranteeing teachers, promoting social education, and establishing schools on a wide scale. In terms of politics, it will improve the political and social atmosphere of the province, improve the district, township, and people's associations, complete provincial autonomy, and lay the foundation for constitutional government. Chairman Luo has taken this plan to Beijing to request instructions and is preparing to begin preparations in the first half of next year and implement it in the second half of the year. Furthermore, the province's political expenses are quite problematic. At present, provincial financial resources are short, and the main source of income is the collection of 600,000 dan of grain as land tax. In addition, the provincial business tax this year is only 900 million yuan, and the increase next year will be limited. The total amount of new provincial taxes will not exceed 1 billion yuan. Looking at the overall income for next year, it will only be over 10 billion yuan, while expenditures will require over 40 billion yuan, leaving a shortfall of over 20 billion yuan, which is now being requested from the central government for additional political expenses. Furthermore, the Department of Construction has recently transferred all 3.3 billion yuan allocated by the central government to repairing the round-the-island highway and provincial roads on Hainan Island. The first phase of the plan is to repair 7,745 kilometers of provincial roads, 16,366 kilometers of county roads, and 351 kilometers of township roads, and experts and engineering teams have been sent to survey.

It is true that some of them were moldy and rotten. Governor Huang Xuchu of the province attached great importance to this case and has telegraphed the Guilin Branch of the Executive Relief Administration to conduct a thorough investigation.

### Lunar Eclipse Spectacle — Observation Record from Taipei Observatory

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 9th Dispatch] This morning, the Taipei Observatory held a lunar eclipse observation meeting. Before the initial loss, the reporter observed the moon from the equatorial instrument and witnessed several rough and uneven black shadows on this moon, which astronomers call the "desolate world." These are the so-called seas of the past, now renamed plains. Among these twelve plains of varying sizes, the largest has a diameter of 230 kilometers and is surrounded by high mountains. The clearly visible form is the white belt-shaped mountain range, of which there are six, the highest being 7 kilometers and the longest being 600 kilometers. There are as many as 112 craters, and there are also radiant lines with a lighter color than the moon itself. This morning, the sky was clear and bright, but at 12:10:12 AM, the moon began to change as it became tangent to the Earth and showed the "moon phase at the beginning of the eclipse," with the eastern edge gradually entering the dimness, appearing dim yellow, and then becoming more deeply tangent, and the brightness decreasing. At 1:18:42 AM, the "inner eclipse began, with the surrounding color blue and tinged with green, the inner layer rose and red-purple, and the innermost layer deep red and leaning towards the lunar surface. At 1:47:53 AM, the position of the moon turned to near Taurus and the star Auriga, and the middle of the moon grazed the Earth's shadow axis and entered the "middle of the eclipse," the plains in the moon became darker, and the mountain ranges and craters were hidden. Only a faint light remained on the lunar surface, the color being the lightest, and the ground was also as dark as the first day of the lunar month. At 2:17:05 AM, the moon was tangent to the Earth for the second time, and the eastern edge began to emit light slightly. Then, the moon phase became brighter, and at 3:25:35 AM, the entire "return to roundness" was achieved, and the moon returned to its original state. According to the Taipei Observatory's observation, the time of this morning's lunar eclipse was very consistent with the predicted time, but due to the limitations of the naked eye and instruments, in today's scientific age, a difference of five autumns above and below is still unavoidable. According to the Observatory's records, this lunar eclipse is also the second one this year. The total lunar eclipse lasted 3 hours, 15 minutes, and 23 seconds from the beginning of the eclipse to the return to roundness, which is 34 minutes and 13 seconds shorter than the first total lunar eclipse that began at 12:44 AM on June 15 this year.

### Postal and Telegraph Rate Hikes Impact Newspaper Industry

Since the implementation of postal and telegraph rate increases, people's organizations in various regions have repeatedly petitioned the government to retract its decision. Among them, those engaged in publishing and journalism feel particularly deeply the adverse impact of these rate hikes on their operations, and their calls for relief have become increasingly urgent. According to news reports, newspapers in the capital believe that the rate increases have significantly impacted their business development. They have repeatedly requested the relevant authorities to reduce the rates, but without success. They convened an emergency meeting on the 8th to discuss countermeasures and resolved: (1) to request the Ministry of Transportation to establish separate payment methods for news-related postal and telegraph services. Before the new methods are announced, the old rates will continue to be paid; (2) to telegraph industry colleagues nationwide to take unified action and temporarily pay according to the old rates until a resolution is reached. Simultaneously, the Hankou Newspaper Association also telegraphed the entire country, requesting the government to retract its decision. As this matter has developed to the current stage, we, as fellow members of the industry, feel it keenly and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we must offer our views to support our colleagues in Beijing and Hankou, and voice our common demands.

First, we want to declare that we share the same dissatisfaction with the general increase in postal and telegraph rates. Postal and telegraph services are state-run public utilities. Private operation of public utilities is not permitted to arbitrarily increase prices, so state-run public utilities should even less be allowed to arbitrarily increase prices. This is a basic principle. From a policy perspective, in the current economic situation, postal and telegraph rate increases not only fail to solve the difficulties currently faced by the postal and telegraph authorities, but also deepen these difficulties. Therefore, adopting this rate increase policy is tantamount to drinking poison to quench thirst. Moreover, once the public utilities directly operated by the state increase prices, the trend will spread, and others will inevitably follow suit, which will harm the balance of social order. The impact is far from insignificant. Therefore, abandoning principle and discussing temporary policies, rate increases are also a bad idea. According to reports of claims by postal authorities, the more postal rates increase, the poorer the post office becomes. It is claimed that before November (before the rate increase), the total revenue of the national postal service was 5 billion yuan, and expenditures were more than 3 billion yuan, resulting in a deficit of about 8 billion yuan. However, after a fivefold increase in November, postal revenue was 10.8 billion yuan, but expenditures increased to 20 billion yuan, an increase of 1 billion yuan compared to past deficits. And postal employees' salaries have not been adjusted. It can be seen that postal and telegraph rate increases may not solve the financial losses of the postal and telegraph service. Under these circumstances, the government could have issued special funds from the national treasury to subsidize the postal and telegraph service's losses. However, the government did not consider this and adopted the rate increase policy, presumably because of its reasoning, which is that using special funds from the national treasury to subsidize the postal and telegraph service's losses would inevitably increase currency issuance, directly stimulate inflation, and indirectly raise prices. This is of course a point worth considering. However, the result of rate increases is the same as the result of allocating funds for subsidies. There is no significant difference between them.

Now that the government has adopted a rate increase policy, the postal and telegraph rate increases seem to have lacked careful consideration. In order to promote the development of national culture, the state originally provided special preferences for the mailing of books and newspapers. This intention is profound and has its reasons. Unfortunately, the impact of this postal and telegraph rate increase on the book and newspaper publishing industry is extremely unfavorable. The Central Daily News once published an article on this postal and telegraph rate increase, believing that this increase in postal, telegraph, and transportation rates does not leave the newspaper industry any room for survival, and it has the suspicion of draining the pond to catch all the fish, which is equivalent to strangling the newspaper industry with a noose. Today's transportation authorities will bear the responsibility of hindering cultural progress and will be the sinners of national culture. Although this argument may be a bit激昂 because of the direct impact, its motives deserve our sympathy. However, since the government has adopted a rate increase policy to compensate for the losses of the postal and telegraph service, there can be no exceptions for the newspaper publishing industry. What we want to ask now is: Is the increase reasonable? If it is unreasonable and implicitly hinders cultural progress, then we should appeal to the government authorities to improve it as soon as possible.

For example, airmail is used to shorten time. In terms of the current domestic transportation situation, we should try our best to use it. However, the measures of the postal authorities seem to be running counter to this. Airmail rates were increased tenfold not long ago. This time, postal rates have been increased again, and the extent of the increase is indeed high, which is really confusing. The postage for one copy of this newspaper by airmail was 274 yuan when it was increased tenfold before. Since this adjustment, it has suddenly increased to 620 yuan, and those that exceed the weight limit by less than 20 centimeters are charged at 150 yuan for every 20 centimeters. However, airline companies did not raise the freight charges during the same period. For example, shipping from Shanghai to Chongqing costs 4,080 yuan per kilogram, which translates to only 40 yuan for every 10 centimeters and 80 yuan for 20 centimeters. And from Shanghai to Nanjing, it costs 720 yuan per kilogram, which translates to only 7.2 yuan for every 10 centimeters and 14.4 yuan for 20 centimeters. However, the postal authorities charge 150 yuan for every 20 centimeters regardless of distance, which is 75 yuan per centimeter, 35 yuan more than the longest distance of Chongqing, and 17 yuan入角 more than the nearest distance of Nanjing. Although this number is small, it adds up, which is indeed considerable. Therefore, there is no problem with the calculation of this postal rate increase. As far as the newspaper industry itself is concerned, the delivery of newspapers is about speed. However, the measures of the postal authorities seem to be hindering the speed of newspaper delivery. No wonder colleagues from all over the country are inevitably emotional about this postal and telegraph rate increase.

Standing from the people's position and thinking for the country, we feel that postal and telegraph rate increases may not be the way to solve the current difficulties. Taking a step back and standing from the newspaper industry's position, we feel that this postal and telegraph rate increase has had too great an unfavorable impact on cultural publishing. If the government has to adopt a rate increase policy, we must appeal to them not to destroy cultural development, and that there can be a preferential approach to newspaper publishing. At least the pricing set must have reasonable regulations and not have an obstructive color.

### Observations on the American Coal Miners' Strike

The recent American coal miners' strike, with its ups and downs, has astonished the whole world. Since the victory, labor strikes have surged in our country, and have not yet completely subsided. Comparing the two, we find many points that can be thought-provoking.

First, starting with the labor side, from beginning to end, their steps were neat and they abided by the rules. Although there were expressions of indignation at the court's sentences and fines, they did not engage in any other transgressive words or deeds other than seeking relief through legal procedures. During the strike, there were no rude actions such as surrounding the capitalists, destroying factories and mines, etc. When the union leader issued a notice declaring a return to work, all members of the group unanimously obeyed, without any objections. Moreover, there were no dissatisfaction or other malicious speculations about their leader.

Secondly, on the factory owner's side, other than quietly resuming work or reopening negotiations, there was no other action. It seems that they did not have any evil means such as destroying the union, or alienating union members.

Thirdly, on the government's side, the way to resolve it was entirely focused on the judicial aspect, based entirely on the law. Even the President's direct appeal to the workers had to wait until the final moment before being decided, and it was never made public. It was once reported that labor and management were negotiating in secret, but the government claimed not to know about it. The US government's point of view is that this strike was illegal, so it is trying to correct its errors from a legal point of view, and at the same time ordering the whole country to strictly conserve coal, in order to last. As for all strong measures, such as arresting people, sealing off the union, etc., not even a single empty word was heard.

Fourthly, on the side of the general public, because coal is the source of all power and the main fuel for household and factory use, they naturally expressed a very anxious attitude, and at the same time showed considerable disgust towards Lewis's stubborn attitude. This time, Lewis suddenly changed direction, which may have been due to the urging of public opinion. But other than the urging of public opinion, what we heard was only support for the government, universal coal and electricity conservation, and preparation for weathering this difficult encounter. There were no other extraneous accusations against the union or the government. As for the general public who were affected by the coal shortage and were forced to close their factories, they were quietly waiting for the resolution of the strike. The workers were like this, and the factory owners were also like this.

Now that the matter has passed, the American people have all breathed a deep sigh of relief, and we are in the Far East, so of course there is no need to re-mention these past events. The reason for re-mentioning these past events now is that in China, where labor strikes are surging, these various forms seem to be very worthy of savoring. Just imagine, if such a large-scale, nationwide strike were to occur in our country, and the time was extended to two months, what would the situation be like? During this period, would there have been other side issues between labor and management? Would the government have followed the legal track and not taken other emergency measures? Could all the coal and electricity conservation measures be readily launched to the whole country? Could the general public respond to the government's instructions, conserve coal and electricity in unison, and quietly await the judicial verdict? Would the so-called third party add fuel to the fire and make their extraneous articles?

The demand for democracy and the rule of law has now reached its peak, but "the name is the reality of reality." There must be substance to the name. Seeing this "incredible" labor strike in America, we not only have infinite feelings about the previous labor strikes, but it seems that realizing democracy and realizing the rule of law is not just a matter of shouting slogans. Whether it is the government, labor and management, or even the public, the third party, we must abide by laws and disciplines, distinguish right from wrong, and do our best in a pragmatic way, so as not to go off track into a fork in the road.

### Suzhou Gentry Impersonate Officials to Extort Money; Fan Junbo and Others Cannot Shirk Responsibility; City Defense Department Transfers the Entire Case to the District Prosecutor's Office

A Clerk at Gaoshengda Makes an Appeal

Although the destruction of Gaoshengda Paper Company has been reported in various newspapers, most of them are vague, leading to misinterpretations. As the accountant, having served the company for 29 years, I can attest that the owner treats people with both kindness and strictness, and the young master, Gao Pengyun, is amiable and approachable, currently studying in the fifth grade at Tongde Medical College. The claims about an inspector are entirely fabricated, creating confusion. On the 30th of last month, at 10 AM, hundreds of vendors gathered in front of the Huangpu Branch, demanding the release of arrested vendors. Failing to achieve their goal, the crowd grew to over a thousand people. The Huangpu Branch, seeing the situation worsen, used fire trucks to spray water and disperse the crowd. However, some of the crowd not only braved the cold water but also threw stones at the police. Nearby shops, fearing accidents, all closed their doors, and our store also put up its shutters. At that time, the owner was not in the store. I instructed my colleagues not to go outside to avoid danger. Unexpectedly, around 6 PM, we suddenly heard someone shouting, "Gaoshengda is spraying water!" A hundred voices echoed the call, and they violently attacked the store door. The police arrived, and the crowd retreated. I went upstairs to investigate and found nothing of the sort. I went downstairs to the front door and shouted loudly to explain, but no one listened. When the police left, the crowd returned and completely destroyed the shutters and glass windows of our store. Then, they rushed into the store, destroying the printing machines, account cabinets, and counters, and threw the goods outside to burn. The burning lasted from 7 PM to 11 PM. The losses at that time were difficult to estimate. On the 1st of this month, we put up bamboo fences to prevent petty thieves. Unexpectedly, at 3 PM, troublemakers again threw iron and cast stones at the glass windows. My colleagues in the store did not make a sound and let it be. Unexpectedly, they tore down the fences, rushed into the store. My colleagues, fearing harm, all fled. At that time, the young owner, Gao Pengyun, unwilling to leave the store, knelt down and begged, hoping to gain their understanding. Not only did they not listen, but he almost suffered an accident. They also completely moved the goods from the warehouse on the second floor and burned them, and the bedding and clothing boxes of the colleagues on the third floor were also affected. The losses were huge, about ten million yuan. The store's losses are currently estimated at over two hundred million yuan. I am 52 years old, my wife is older, and I have neither uncles nor many brothers, let alone nephews. In my 29 years of service at Gaoshengda, my savings, worth over two million yuan in clothing and jewelry, were all looted by the rioters. I cannot claim compensation from the store owner, nor can I seek it from my elder relatives. But half a lifetime of hard work has gone down the drain. How can I not be heartbroken! I beg for the sympathy of all sectors of society to help the store owner, which is to help my colleagues, to resume business as soon as possible and to settle down as soon as possible. I hereby report the factual circumstances and my pitiful feelings in the newspaper, which can also serve as a sad page in my decades of history! (Zhao Menglong)

Strange! A Household Registration Investigation?

Near Cangnan Gate in Yongfeng Town, Songjiang County, there is a self-defense corps stationed from Kuatang Town. Around 7 PM on the 4th of this month, I returned to my hometown from Shanghai and went to a relative's house first. My wife was also there. Unexpectedly, we heard a shout to open the door. At that time, my relatives were extremely frightened, not knowing what was happening. However, we had no choice but to open the door. We saw a group of people carrying guns, with no manners, rushing into the house and shouting, "Household registration investigation!" At that time, my heart was calm. Unexpectedly, they checked my ID card. I explained that I worked for a newspaper and showed them my badge. They insisted that I was impersonating someone and argued for a long time before leaving grudgingly. May I ask, when they investigated household registrations, they had neither household registration books nor the presence of the local village chief. Moreover, their uniforms were not neat. I earnestly hope that the authorities will promptly investigate this kind of blitz-style household registration investigation to maintain security. (Zhuang Yongzhang)

### Wuhu - Everything Cannot Stand the Test: A Perspective on the Core Area of Anhui Province

— By Bai Yuwen, Special Correspondent of This Newspaper

Although the Anhui Provincial Government is located in Hefei, it is merely the seat of the provincial government. The province's economic and political center of gravity remains in Wuhu. Southern Anhui is the wealthy region of the entire province, exporting more than 10 million shi of grain from Wuhu each year, earning a large amount of banknotes and goods, which are then distributed from Wuhu to all counties in southern Anhui. It is the breathing tube of Anhui. With its location on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, and its well-developed river, sea, ship, railway, and highway transportation, its position has become increasingly important. The people of Anhui love Wuhu and value it even more. What is Wuhu like now?

Construction

There were too many upstarts during the occupation period, and because there was no major battle when the enemy invaded Wuhu, the degree of destruction was far less than that of Hunan and Guangxi. Zhongshan Road, Zhenglu, Erjie Road, and the roads have seen many more new-style buildings than before the war. At the beginning of the victory, the newly arrived officials and celebrities were particularly interested in construction. The victorious country needed victorious decorations, which was naturally right. The opening of the Huantang Road in the refugee area and the construction of the Zhongshan Memorial Hall, planting foreign trees on the sidewalks, and spending tens of millions or hundreds of millions of yuan, although people from Shanghai and Nanjing still found Wuhu pitifully small when they first arrived, those from the inland, strolling on the road, seeing neon lights, and hearing radios, thought that Shanghai was no more than that. Zhang Weixia, the Administrative Inspector of the Sixth District, initially concurrently served as the director of the Municipal Preparation Office. Zhang has indelible achievements in the construction of Wuhu City. Many buildings have his inscription, and Huantang Road has been officially named "Weixia" Road. But heaven was never going to stop raining, and the road immediately turned into a paddy field for transplanting rice seedlings. For several days, model boats could be floated on both sides of the Erjie Road, and the shops and houses on both sides turned into flower boats on the Qinhuai River, with everyone building gangways to get ashore. Even a deaf person has ears, and the name of the ear and its appearance still have some function. Then the sidewalks of Wuhu still qualify as the ears of a deaf person. The wide places of the sidewalks are two or three feet wide, and the narrow places are probably only one foot wide. In this narrow space, we still have to plant sidewalk trees. If people can walk like snakes, it's nothing. Some trees are planted right in the middle of the shop's front door. If you don't pay attention, you will rush straight out from the house and collide with the tree. The Zhongshan Memorial Hall was completed in less than a few months, costing more than 140 million yuan, and now it is leaking rain and is about to collapse. The Council has raised serious questions about this. The Zhongshan Bridge cost tens of millions of yuan last year, but it has not yet started construction, and the contractor has run away. These are all construction projects. Regardless of whether they are beneficial or not, even if they are harmful, we do the same as other places do. It's not that we are unwilling to do things.

Public Security

There is a certain rule about what clothes to wear at what time and what things to know. Preventing epidemics in summer and preventing theft in winter are considered central tasks by officials and gentry. Before Wuhu entered winter defense, thieves were ignorant of the times and ran rampant. Perhaps it was because they were not within the scope of winter defense, and few people cared. The time for winter defense had long passed, and everyone seemed to be concentrating on preventing thieves. Startling alarm reports were sounded several times every night, indicating that it was winter defense curfew. The thieves were simply unreasonable. Only last night at 6 o'clock, in the densely populated Changjie Street, three bandits suddenly broke into the Wenfushanfang Bookstore and Zhuangde Bookstore. They failed to rob money and openly opened fire, killing the bookstore owner, Huang Youquan. The night before last at 8 o'clock, when the Zhongshan Memorial Hall was showing a movie, some of the students in the audience fought with the movie theater. At the same time, someone was setting off firecrackers for a wedding, which made everyone think that something big had happened. A police alarm was sounded first, and the military and police were dispatched everywhere, announcing a temporary curfew. The shops on the road were baffled and closed their doors one after another, and pedestrians hurried home in panic. It wasn't until a few hours later that they realized it was a false alarm.

Commerce

Wuhu is a commercial port on the Yangtze River. In addition to the Zhongjiao, Nong, Shanghai, Industrial, Provincial, and County eight banks, there are more than 60 illegal money houses. There are many department stores and cloth shops. The broadcasting of the broadcasters is so loud that even cars cannot hear them. Bands are desperately blowing and beating in the windows of the shops and on the streets. The people of Wuhu probably love music too much. They use bands for business promotion, weddings, funerals, meetings, openings, and when the secretary-general is transferred, they send gifts and rewards to the band. At all times, they are blowing and beating. Wuhu seems to be a paradise on the surface. But if you talk to people in the business community, look at the advertisements for clearing accounts in the newspapers, and the debt disputes, the entire business arena is collapsing. Except for a very few, all are relying on high-interest loans to support their facade. After the end of the winter, it is predicted that less than two-thirds of the stores will be able to go public after the Spring Festival. The shops in Wuhu's largest joint commercial arena, such as Dahua and Guohuo Company, are closing down one after another, leaving only three or four stores, deserted and deserted. Guohuo Company is selling real estate and clearing debts. Yesterday, a creditor forcibly moved away the goods sealed by the company, resulting in litigation. Prices rise every day, affecting wages. The survival of industry and commerce feels threatened, and the number of unemployed people is increasing. Temporary relief and winter relief cannot solve this serious problem.

Everything in Wuhu cannot stand the test. A fat man cannot stand a single blow. Living one day at a time! Everyone lives and waits with this feeling. (November 28)

### Gu Weijun's Speech Supports India - South Africa Should Not Discriminate Against Race - UN General Assembly Adopts Political Committee Resolution for Negotiations Between the Two Countries - Discussion of the Troop Investigation Case Yields No Results

[Central News Agency, New York, 8th Dispatch] My chief representative, Gu Weijun, recently stated that China will do its utmost to support India's accusation against South Africa for mistreating Indians. Mr. Gu voted in the General Assembly in favor of a resolution urging South Africa to comply with its obligations under the United Nations Charter and not to engage in racial discrimination. He pointed out that although this matter is only a legal issue in some respects, it is actually an extremely important political issue. The relationship between these two United Nations member states is not only damaged, but completely obstructed. When he mentioned the seriousness of the situation between the two countries, he said that the United Nations should be responsible for dealing with this matter immediately, and said that South Africa's discriminatory laws are not only enforced on Indians, but also on people from all Asian countries, including Chinese people. He also said that China's sponsorship of this draft resolution is not because it is related to China itself, but only because China is a member of the United Nations. When discussing South Africa's proposal to submit this matter to the newly established World Court for handling, Mr. Gu said that this move may have unfortunate consequences, because (1) if the court believes that the United Nations has jurisdiction over this matter, then the General Assembly will have to deal with this matter again, which will delay the issue. (2) If the court believes that this issue is a domestic matter in South Africa, it will not help solve the problem and will make India dissatisfied. (3) If the court's opinions are divided, it will lose its reputation. Mr. Gu asked, is it fair for us to place such a heavy burden on the World Court? Prior to this, ten representatives had expressed doubts about whether there was a legal obligation on this matter internationally. Mr. Gu replied that the Chinese delegation believes that there should be an international duty on this matter based on the 1926 Cape Town Agreement. He also said that apart from this matter, any country that has signed the United Nations Charter has international obligations.

[French News Agency, Flushing Meadow, 9th Dispatch] The UN General Assembly held a plenary session today and adopted the Political Security Committee's resolution on the dispute between South Africa and India with a majority of 32 votes to 15, with seven abstentions. The resolution stipulates that India and South Africa should hold direct negotiations on the treatment of the Indian minority in South Africa and submit a report to the next session of the General Assembly to ensure that the treatment of South African Indians is consistent with the provisions of the agreements between the two countries and the principles of the Atlantic Charter. Earlier, there was a debate on the amendment proposed by South African Prime Minister Smuts. Mr. Smuts requested that the case be submitted to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for arbitration to determine whether the UN General Assembly has the power to interfere in the internal affairs of a member state, which was firmly supported by British representative Shawcross. Soviet representative Vyshinsky refuted, "This case is absolutely international in nature, because this move violates the separate agreements signed by the two independent governments in 1927 and 1932, which guarantee each other's immigrants. It is very clear that this case cannot be classified as a judicial issue. The South African government's actions to discriminate against Indians are numerous. It initially claimed that these people were Jews, and now it has failed morally and is using legal issues as an excuse." At this point, Indian representative Mrs. Pandit stood up and questioned Shawcross on how the judgment of the International Court of Justice was normally done. Mrs. Pandit said, "Mr. Shawcross is clinging to the current situation in India when debating the issue of Indian minorities. This kind of irony is irrelevant to the issue itself. Furthermore, the British should bear most of the responsibility for the current situation in India. Please pay attention to this, Mr. Shawcross. We know that the whole world respects human rights, justice, and loyalty, and the whole world is a friend of those who are oppressed." Smuts' amendment was finally rejected by 21 votes to 21, with two abstentions.

[Our News] New York, 9th. Broadcast: The United Nations General Assembly is discussing the issue of troop investigation in various countries. The British representative advocated establishing an inspection system to investigate whether the figures reported by various countries are accurate. Molotov expressed opposition, saying that the issue of foreign troops should not be confused with the issue of domestic troops. The two sides debated fiercely, and there was no result. It was changed to be discussed again today.

### Political Group Passes Resolution - Severing Diplomatic Relations with the Franco Regime - Madrid Demonstrates to Protest Against the United Nations

[French News Agency, Lake Success, 9th Dispatch] The amendment proposed by five Latin American countries on the Spanish issue, advocating that the United Nations sever diplomatic relations with Franco, was passed yesterday by the Political and Security Committee by a vote of 11 to 6. Venezuela, Yugoslavia, Chile, Byelorussia, Panama, France, Guatemala, Mexico, Norway, Poland, and the Soviet Union voted in favor. China, Cuba, Colombia, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States voted against. The Belgian representative abstained. As for the draft resolution proposed by the United States, it merely called on the Spanish people to organize "an acceptable government to replace the government led by Franco." The committee continued its meeting today and passed a proposal to prohibit France from purchasing food from Franco's Spain by a vote of 11 to 5, with two abstentions.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 9th Dispatch] The Anglo-Americans strongly opposed the passage of the severance of diplomatic relations with the Franco regime by the subcommittee on the Spanish issue. It is expected that the case will not win the statutory two-thirds majority in the General Assembly vote.

[Our News] London, 9th Broadcast: Madrid held an officially authorized demonstration. Franco gave a speech to the public, saying that Spain could not tolerate foreign interference in Spain's internal affairs. Franco made this statement when the UN's opposition to Franco's rhetoric was heating up, which was obviously a warning against the UN's interference in Spain's internal affairs.

[Reuters, Madrid, 9th Dispatch] Several bombs exploded in Barcelona, and the front of the youth league headquarters building there was destroyed by the bombs. It is reported that the city's left-wing groups have scheduled a general strike today to protest against the government-authorized grand demonstration. At the same time, resistance members in Madrid issued a declaration exposing the Falange members for oppressing workers and forcing them to participate in Franco's demonstration.

### Truman and Bevin Talk for One Hour

Discuss Various Important Issues

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 9th (Radio): President Truman received British Foreign Secretary Bevin at the White House for an hour-long meeting, reviewing important issues such as Palestine, India, Germany, and the Mediterranean. White House Press Secretary Ross stated: "This was a social visit, but the conversation naturally turned to international issues." It is reported that when discussing the Palestinian issue, Truman advocated partial recognition of the partition plan supported by the Jews but opposed by the Arabs and the British. Truman suggested submitting the partition plan to the London roundtable conference to be held in January next year, at which time the United States will send representatives to observe. Bevin returned to New York today.

### Italy Wishes to Reconcile with Yugoslavia

[Reuters London, day not given (radio transmission date)] A radio station states: Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi delivered a speech in Milan, expressing his hope to restore friendly diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia, to establish an agreement regarding the treatment of Italians in Yugoslavia, and to establish commercial relations with Yugoslavia.

### Fires of Civil War in Iran Spread; Nationwide General Election Postponed; Government Determined to Safeguard Territorial Sovereignty and Integrity

[Our Dispatch] London, 9th (Radio): After Iranian Prime Minister Sultan announced that government troops had entered Azerbaijan province, it immediately aroused a reaction from Azerbaijan province leader Pishavari. He called on students and other youths to arm themselves and issued a statement saying that the people of the province would resist the government troops entering Azerbaijan province, and if necessary, would continue to attack, directly striking Tehran. Sultan dispatched planes to fly over Tabriz, dropping leaflets explaining that the government troops entered Azerbaijan province only to monitor the election, and said: "If Azerbaijan province truly belongs to Iranian territory, then the government troops have the right to act freely."

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 8th] It is learned that the Iranian government forces, based in Qazvin, continue to advance, sweeping and eliminating the remnants of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party's army along the way. However, as of now, they have not yet reached the border of Azerbaijan province. Other government forces are currently "exploring the enemy's lines" on the eastern border of Azerbaijan province. In addition, the Iranian general election, originally scheduled to begin today, has been postponed because the police failed to arrive in time to "protect" the polling stations. According to the new parliamentary general election, it will be held simultaneously throughout the country (except for Azerbaijan province). However, political figures speculate that the general election may not be held within a week. Election campaigns have not yet begun throughout the country. Even in Tehran, voters are still unaware of the list of candidates. On the other hand, the mayor of Tabriz, the capital of Azerbaijan province, has ordered all voters to prepare for the election. Prime Minister Sultan specifically telegraphed the governor of Azerbaijan province, Yavari, issuing a warning to him, saying that since the leader of Azerbaijan province does not allow government troops to enter Azerbaijan province, even if Tabriz holds a general election, it will still be regarded as invalid. Tehran Radio is still continuing to broadcast, constantly exposing the claims of Azerbaijan.

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 9th] Iranian Cabinet Prime Minister Sultan last night announced for the first time that Iranian government forces were attacked by Azerbaijan province troops. The communique stated: "Azerbaijan province guerrillas gathered in the Qiaflankoh district (near the Mianeh-Tabriz highway) and opened fire on government troops. If the actions of the Azerbaijan province leader threaten the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Iran, then the government, in order to fulfill its duties, will spare no expense."

Furthermore: An Iranian government plane dropped leaflets over Azerbaijan province today, asking the people to rise up and resist the Azerbaijan "democratic government."

### Communists Conduct Anti-American Propaganda in South America

Former U.S. Secretary of State Welles Broadcasts

[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] Former Secretary of State Welles stated in a national broadcast today that the Communist Party is lobbying the Latin American republics, accusing the United States of engaging in imperialist and capitalist policies and exploiting the South American republics. Welles also stated that in recent years, the Communist parties of the South American republics have been targeting civilians for propaganda, using the U.S. government's mistakes in recent years as tools for anti-propaganda.

### My Representative's Proposal Rejected; Veto Power Remains a Pending Issue; Disarmament Committee Debates Much, Accomplishes Little

[Reuters, Lake Success, 8th] The UN Political Committee recently passed a resolution proposed by Australia on the issue of the use of the veto power. The resolution requests the five permanent members of the Security Council to guarantee that the exercise of the veto power will not hinder the Security Council from quickly reaching resolutions, and suggests quickly adopting measures to reduce the difficulties in exercising the veto power. It also requests the Security Council to seriously consider the opinions put forward by the member states of the United Nations when formulating the aforementioned measures.

The proposals put forward by the Chinese delegation requesting the Security Council to take steps to enable the exercise of the veto power to promote the speedy adoption of resolutions by the Council, and the proposal put forward by the Cuban delegation to convene a general assembly of the member states of the United Nations to discuss the veto power and consider amending the Charter, were all rejected.

[Reuters, Lake Success, date not given] The Political Committee's subcommittee engaged in formulating a plan for disarmament and banning atomic weapons. After a long debate yesterday, no agreement was reached. Soviet representative Vyshinsky still stated that the veto power is only exercised in the Security Council and should not be exercised in the committee controlling armaments. However, he also said that the Security Council should be primarily responsible for the disarmament issue. British representative Lankruth stated that the Security Council should indicate the power of the control committee in the agreement signed by the member states, and the committee should have absolute independence in exercising these powers.

### UN Trusteeship Committee Passes Indian Proposal

Southwest Africa Under International Trusteeship

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 8th] Regarding the issue of the South African Union's request to merge Southwest Africa, the UN Trusteeship Committee held a meeting to discuss it. The draft resolution proposed by India, advocating that Southwest Africa should be placed under international trusteeship, and that its administering power should prepare a draft trusteeship agreement in accordance with Article 79 of the United Nations Charter and submit it to the United Nations organization, has been passed by the Trusteeship Committee.

### Results of the French Senate Re-election; People's Party Has Only One More Seat Than the Communist Party

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, date not given] The electors of the French provinces began electing senators of the French Fourth Republic today. As of 11:15 pm tonight (Greenwich Mean Time), the results obtained in mainland France and French Algeria showed that a total of 214 senators were elected. The People's Republican Movement Party only has one more seat than the Communist Party. The number of seats obtained by each party is as follows: Among the 100 senators from mainland France, 127 were directly elected by the "electors." Among these 127 seats, the People's Republican Party occupies 54 seats, the Communist Party occupies 32 seats, and the Socialist Party occupies 12 seats. Therefore, the number of seats obtained by the People's Republican Party is far more than that of the Communist Party. As for the remaining 73 of the 200 senators from mainland France, they are allocated according to the proportion of votes obtained by each party in the primary election. Therefore, the result is that the number of seats obtained by the Communist Party is only one seat less than that of the People's Republican Party. According to political observers, the Senate of the Republic will have a total of 315 senators. In addition to the 214 already elected, there are still 101 to be elected. Fifty of them will be elected by the National Assembly, and fifty-one will be elected by the councils of the overseas territories. It is expected that the People's Republican Party will probably have a greater advantage in the Senate. The Senate of the Republic will open at the end of this year, and its first task will be to elect the President of the Republic together with the National Assembly. The Senate of the Republic will also review the laws and bills approved by the National Assembly and can provide opinions. It is also necessary to consult the Senate before declaring war.

### Acheson Outlines the U.S. Relief Plan

Denies Using Food as a Political Weapon

[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th (Special Dispatch)] U.S. Under Secretary of State Acheson recently broadcast that the outside world's claim that the United States refuses to participate in international relief efforts because it does not want to cooperate with countries around the world, and that the United States attempts to use food as a political weapon, is not true. Acheson continued, saying that he is asking Congress for generous funding for the emergency needs of three or four European countries for next year's relief efforts. The American people and Congress have decided not to place large amounts of property in locations where the United States cannot control these funds. Acheson briefly outlined the U.S.'s plan to continue providing necessary relief as follows: (1) First, countries should immediately consider what contributions they can make to relief efforts after the UN is abolished. (2) Every country in need of assistance obtains the UN's approval. (3) The United Nations Secretariat should be the place to accept the plans of the relevant countries. Acheson said that under this arrangement, countries receiving relief must prove their poverty and must be responsible for providing relief regardless of political views.

### Nuqrashi Ordered to Form New Egyptian Cabinet

Sidqi Explains Reasons for Resignation

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 9th] After Egyptian Prime Minister Sidqi resigned, King Farouk appointed Nuqrashi to form a new cabinet.

[Reuters, Cairo, 8th] Former Prime Minister Sidqi issued a communique this afternoon, stating that when the Egyptian cabinet resigned, it still maintained the principle of joint administration of Sudan, and expressed regret that the Sudan Governor-General issued a declaration by order of London before reaching an agreement with the Egyptian side. Sudan President Huddleston, with the consent of Prime Minister Attlee, issued a statement stating that the Sudanese government will not be affected by others and will continue to prepare for the autonomy of the Sudanese people and allow them to freely choose the future status of Sudan. A person close to Sidqi said: Sidqi believes that this statement is equivalent to the British side unilaterally deciding with Sudan, which is equivalent to the British side destroying the Anglo-Egyptian treaty negotiation. It is said that the main reason for the resignation of the Egyptian Prime Minister was because of this.

### Wei Lihuang Arrives in the United States

[United Press, California, Elfert, 9th] General Wei Lihuang and his wife arrived here today from Hawaii on a British Army transport plane. They will inspect military bases and other facilities throughout the United States. Brigadier General Rendell, commander of the San Antonio Army, welcomed him at the airport. Rendell worked with Wei in China for two years.

### Indian Constituent Assembly Opens; Muslim League Representatives Refuse to Participate; British Proposal to Divide Provinces Draws Criticism

[United Press, New Delhi, 9th] The Indian Constituent Assembly solemnly opened in the Constitution Hall today, in order to implement the second stage of the Indian independence plan. The atmosphere was quite solemn, but the 75 seats of the Muslim League were empty because the Muslim League boycotted the assembly. When the 221 representatives of the Congress Party and small parties entered the venue, mounted and foot police guarded the area around the hall, and vehicles and pedestrians were not allowed to pass. At the opening, the dark clouds that had笼单over New Delhi for two days suddenly cleared, and the sun shone brightly. After the opening, Congress Party leader Kripalani walked past the party representatives, including Nehru, and delivered a short speech, introducing the interim chairman Sinha, who is seventy-eight years old and the oldest representative in the assembly.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 9th] India will enter an important week today. The Congress Party Executive Committee is scheduled to meet today to review the statement issued by the British government after the end of the London talks. Nehru will arrive in time to attend, and the Constituent Assembly will definitely open today. The League has already stated that it does not intend to participate. The Congress Party representative of Ajmer-Merwara indicated yesterday that some Congress Party members will also refuse to participate in the Constituent Assembly. They oppose dividing the provinces of India into several groups for the purpose of constitution-making. If the British government's provincial division system cannot be withdrawn, then they will refuse to attend the Constituent Assembly. The Sikhs also oppose the division of provinces. A Sikh representative said that since it is recognized that the constitution cannot force a group of people who are unwilling to accept it, there is a division of provinces, but if within a province, such as Punjab province, because 60 million Muslims are willing to accept a certain constitution, how can 12 million Sikhs and Hindus be forced to accept it. The original suggestion was to divide the provinces of India into three categories. According to the British document of May 16, each province has the right to choose which category of province to join after the constitution is completed. The Congress Party explained that each province has the right to choose from the beginning. The statement submitted to the British government yesterday stated that this difference in interpretation should be decided by the Federal Court, and the resolution should be accepted by both parties. It is reported that the Congress Party is prepared to accept the ruling of the Federal Court.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 8th] Indian Interim Government Deputy Chairman and Foreign Minister Nehru (Congress Party) and Defense Minister Singh (Sikh) returned to New Delhi together today, two hours earlier than originally scheduled.

### After Coal Mine Strike Resolved, American Life Returns to Normal; Congress to Discuss Amending Labor Law

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 9th (Radio): American coal miners returned to work today, marking the end of the 17-day strike.

[Our Washington Correspondent, 9th (Special Dispatch)] After the United Mine Workers of America President Lewis expressed his submission to President Truman and issued a return-to-work order, the local authorities are quietly waiting for the reaction of the coal miners. Generally, people are quite optimistic about the rapid restoration of coal production, but the government authorities expect that the repercussions caused by this major strike will make the disputes between the Congress, the courts, and the coal miners remain unresolved for a long time. According to news from the mining area, the coal miners have rarely expressed opposition to the return-to-work order, probably because they have repeatedly decided to strike this year, and the coal miners have lost more than eight weeks of wages. It is generally expected that the coal mines will resume work on Monday morning, but production will not return to normal until Wednesday or Thursday.

[Associated Press, New York, 8th] After the United Mine Workers of America President Lewis unconditionally surrendered to the government, his movement to demand wage increases has been frustrated. The mine owners are now quietly waiting for further actions by the government and whether Congress will discuss the new labor law in January next year. Various industries affected by the coal mine strike are planning to return to normal. 300,000 unemployed workers must wait for coal supplies to arrive before they can resume work. After the end of the strike, various coal restrictions at home and abroad have actually been lifted. This Christmas will be brightly lit, stores can have more goods, public places can restore heating equipment, and large parcels will resume delivery.

[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] Members of Congress today expressed their determination to discuss the new labor law, but hinted that the submission of the United Mine Workers of America President Lewis has dispelled the final severe punishment.

### Situation Tense on the Greek-Yugoslav Border

[Reuters, Belgrade, 8th] It is reported that there was a fierce battle near Gevgelija on the Greek-Yugoslav border. The Yugoslav authorities have locked down the border traffic from Amoprustun to Greek Macedonia. Another unconfirmed report stated that several Greek planes invaded Yugoslav territory at that location and were shot at by Yugoslav artillery fire. UN personnel said they saw planes dive and strafe on the border and heard dense artillery fire from within Greece.

[Reuters, Athens, 8th] Greek Deputy Prime Minister Tsouderos confirmed that the Yugoslav government has submitted a protest letter to the Greek ambassador to Yugoslavia regarding the intrusion of Greek planes into Yugoslav territory. The Greek government will conduct an investigation before responding.

### My Consolation Mission Returns to Batavia

### The Truth of the "Miyazaki Incident" is Revealed; The Eight-One-Three Conspiracy is Exposed

[Kaizosha, Tokyo, 9th] After the Eight-One-Three Incident, Japan fabricated various stories in an attempt to find an excuse to launch an invasion. At that time, there was the so-called "Miyazaki Incident." Today, Private First Class Miyazaki, who was lightly reported by the Japanese, suddenly declared from his hometown of Hiroshima that he is still alive and stated that the August 13th disaster was caused by the Japanese army by way of excuse. The truth of the "Miyazaki Incident" is now revealed. According to Miyazaki, on July 4, 1937, taking advantage of the opportunity to go out, he decided to escape and sneaked into a British ship, but was discovered. He then jumped into the river and was rescued by the Chinese and taken to Nanjing. Soon after, he saw his photo published in Japanese newspapers, publicizing the "Miyazaki unlawful kidnapping incident." Miyazaki was greatly shocked and rushed to surrender and was sent to Shanghai. For the sake of face, the Japanese army did not want to reveal the truth and strictly prohibited the publication of the news of Miyazaki's return. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison for the crime of embezzling military property and was sent to the Kojima Prison to serve his sentence. He was only released on parole in April this year and is currently engaged in food production in his hometown.

The outfit worn by members of Admiral Byrd's Antarctic expedition (Special dispatch from The New York Times)

### Humanity's Gaze Turns to Antarctica; American Expedition Team Conducts Scientific Research

— (Written by Franz of the Associated Press; translated by our translation room)

Antarctica, with an area equivalent to two Europes, and the surrounding waters, has now become America's vast scientific research laboratory.

Long before the survey team led by Rear Admiral Byrd, comprising more than twenty-five prominent scientists and two hundred researchers (a total of 4,000 personnel including all support staff), set sail, all available information directly related to this "bottom of the world" had been collected, organized, and analyzed for use by the expedition personnel.

Many scientific departments of the government have sent their own personnel to participate in this survey team, preparing to transfer the observations obtained in the following scientific fields, such as electronics, marine biology, atmospheric dynamics, medicine, mineralogy, refrigeration, and agriculture, to civilian enterprises in the future.

Experts believe that the Antarctic region is indeed the most ideal laboratory for experimenting with the use of knowledge and methods developed in the war during peacetime. Most of the phenomena in Antarctica are still isolated from humans and have not been discovered. Therefore, this exploration, which is carried out using airplanes or submarines, has the effect of advancing the boundaries of human knowledge.

In terms of the scope of the problem and the scale of rapid concentration of manpower and material resources, apart from the Manhattan Project completed by the Army in the past to develop the atomic bomb, there is nothing comparable to this Navy's Antarctic survey work.

Decades ago, the exploration of the polar regions was entirely a matter of navigation technology on the water, and a matter of the limits of human cold resistance on land. Geographic boundaries were advancing rapidly like a dog-sled. Currently, the edge of this six million square miles of known area is advancing at a rate of three hundred miles per hour.

This survey will apply the world's newest and most sophisticated aircraft, propellers, radar, aerial cameras, sonic depth finders, snowmobiles, dehydrated foods, and aerial ore detectors to explore undiscovered mineral deposits in technical work.

Although there are so many modern tools, the key to success still lies in two simple and old factors, namely, keeping hands warm in the absolute cold of Antarctica and the physical strength of sled dogs, which is necessary in some cases for land surveys.

For high-altitude flights, we already have special clothing that keeps the human body warm, but keeping the temperature of the hands of mechanics working on aircraft warm in the polar regions is still a technically difficult problem.

Early Antarctic exploration reports mentioned large deposits of bituminous coal and trace amounts of copper, gold, and manganese. Large-scale exploration has never been done before. When the Navy Antarctic Survey Plan's first informal report was published, people immediately speculated that one of its purposes was to find uranium ore.

Hibernating U.S. Warships

With the enemy kneeling and the atmosphere of war dissipating, the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force are all exhibiting a remarkable phenomenon. In the Navy department, all warships and merchant ships are now quietly moored in the harbor, entering a period of hibernation. The cannons on board are all tightly wrapped with plastic film and sprayed with layers of resin to seal and protect them, so as to make them immortal for a long time. When the time comes, none will be materials of no use, therefore, the stage of hibernation is likely to be the eve before the spring awakening.

(Special dispatch from The New York Times)

A portion of the U.S. Sixteenth Fleet, totaling twenty-five naval vessels and merchant ships, is now quietly moored in the harbor.

Workers tightly wrap the cannons of warships and spray resin on them to create a protective effect, so that they will not decay even after a long time.

After wrapping and sealing, technicians inspect the internal condition, especially strictly checking whether the temperature is kept dry and whether the climate is normal.

A shot from the Manei Strait Naval Shipyard in Norfolk, Virginia: The cannon is given a close seal after a rubber spraying procedure

### New Shantytowns Prohibited Within Designated Zones; Demolition Begins Tomorrow; Public Works and Police Bureaus Explain Management and Enforcement Measures; Citywide, There Are Over 40,000 Shantytown Households

[Our Report] The Municipal Authorities have decided to begin enforcing the prohibition of building shantytowns within the designated Cai Li District starting tomorrow (the 11th). Existing shantytowns will be permitted to remain. However, if any obstruct traffic or span over waterways, requiring demolition, efforts will be made to provide alternative solutions for relocation. Starting tomorrow, the Municipal Public Works Bureau will, in conjunction with the Police Bureau, organize a patrol team. Relevant supervisors from both bureaus will lead police and workmen to patrol various districts. If newly erected, incomplete shantytowns are found within the prohibited construction zones, workmen will be instructed to assist in demolition, returning the materials to the builders for construction in non-prohibited areas.

Yesterday, at 10:30 AM, Zhao Zukang, Director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, and Fang Zhichao, Director of the Administrative Division of the Police Bureau, jointly met with reporters at the Municipal Government to explain the management and enforcement measures regarding new shantytowns. Director Zhao first explained that the construction of shantytowns was due to housing shortages and the economic problems faced by both military and civilians. In fact, the Municipal Government encourages housing construction to solve the housing shortage and permits shantytown construction, but with restrictions. These restrictions ensure no hinderance to hygiene, fire prevention, and public order. Although the Municipal Government has announced measures to prohibit shantytowns, enforcement will be lenient. However, shantytown construction in prohibited areas has increased unabated. Currently, including those built during the occupation, there are approximately 40,000 households. Of these, 2,708 households have applied for licenses, but only 468 have been granted, leaving the remainder as illegal structures. The city's population is estimated at over four million. To safeguard the safety of the majority, the interests of a few must be sacrificed. Considering summer hygiene and winter fire prevention, these shantytowns are harmful to all residents. Furthermore, some individuals occupy public or private land, building houses for business and sale, which cannot be tolerated. This decision was approved at the municipal meeting on the 2nd of this month, with representatives from the Municipal Council, the Local Court, and the Procuratorate in attendance.

Director Zhao also reported that the licensing procedure has been improved for convenience. Ordinary construction permits can usually be issued within one to two weeks, and miscellaneous permits, such as for repairs or shantytown construction, can be issued within five days.

Director Fang then stated that the police exercise state authority on behalf of the nation, executing duties according to laws and regulations without arbitrary actions. However, officers may sometimes act firmly when executing orders. The public should not misunderstand. Municipal administration must consider future policies. We should not only address immediate needs at the expense of the overall plan. Currently, the Public Works Bureau and the Police Bureau have jointly petitioned the Municipal Government to instruct the Land Bureau to designate areas for shantytown construction. Before such areas are designated, existing shantytowns will be managed without strict enforcement. Those being constructed or nearing completion will be ordered to be demolished.

### Jiangwan Armory: Intermittent Explosions; Thorough Investigation of the Cause; Risky Inspection of the Armory; Four Charred Bodies Unearthed Yesterday

[Our Report] The First Sub-Depot of the Second Ordnance Reserve Depot of the Logistics Headquarters experienced an ammunition explosion. Yesterday afternoon, the depot became quiet. The responsible authorities began to actively work on the aftermath, starting with extinguishing the remaining fires, then searching for bodies and assessing the damage. Yesterday, a total of four bodies were found. One was reduced to only an abdomen, another to the lower half of the body, and the other two were charred beyond recognition.

After the incident occurred, relevant authorities in the capital attached great importance to it. The Logistics Headquarters of the Ministry of National Defense dispatched Major General Lei Zhaojie, a specialist from the Field Operations Department, to Shanghai to conduct a thorough investigation. Mao Sen, Director of the Garrison Headquarters of the Capital and Shanghai, was sent to assist in the investigation. Yesterday morning, they, along with Commander Fu of the First Supply Zone, ventured into the exploded armory for inspection. Our reporter followed inside and saw fragments of ammunition and rubble everywhere. The heat from the ground was scorching. Firefighters continued to pour water inside, while engineers began digging. A burnt truck wreck and four charred bodies were discovered in the southern part of the warehouse. It is believed that these were the remains of transport soldiers who were close to the explosion site at the time. Several more bodies may be located in other parts of the warehouse, but excavation could not continue due to the high ground temperature. As of yesterday evening, no further discoveries have been reported.

The reporter then went to Lu Jiyun, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Logistics Headquarters. According to him, while the cause of the explosion has not been determined, the most likely scenario is that a hand grenade accidentally detonated upon impact. According to warehouse soldiers who escaped with injuries, they were unloading three trucks of hand grenades from the First Supply Station of the Zhejiang Supply Bureau using a line transfer method. They were standing close to the outside of the warehouse, and no unauthorized personnel were allowed inside. No anomalies were observed. Suddenly, a loud explosion occurred. Some believe that hand grenades do not easily explode. However, all ammunition explosions are due to heat reaching a certain level. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that dropping a whole box of hand grenades onto a cement floor could cause friction and heat in the internal explosives, leading to an explosion. The number of casualties is confirmed to be less than what was rumored. Five warehouse soldiers were injured, and seven were initially unaccounted for. Four bodies have now been found, leaving only three unaccounted for. The details of the damage cannot be determined because the fire area has not been completely cleared. The department has records of the ammunition stored, and a detailed breakdown will be available soon.

Also, it is reported that Commander Fu told reporters that he plans to host a briefing in the coming days for the Shanghai press to report the details and handling of the incident. Regarding rumors of a suspect being arrested, it has not been confirmed.

### City Party Committee Sent Representatives to Comfort Nearby Residents Yesterday

Fang Zhi, Director of the City’s Education Department, after learning of the explosion at the Second Ordnance Depot of the First Supply Zone at the Jiangwan Stadium, expressed great concern for nearby residents. Yesterday, he sent Chen Baotai, Director of the Organization and Training Department, to the Wujiaochang area of Jiangwan to provide comfort. Residents in the vicinity had fled to avoid shrapnel injuries after the incident. Upon hearing that the explosions had stopped, they gradually returned. Director Chen’s visits comforted them.

### Counterfeit "Anti-Currency" Case Concluded in Court; "North Sea Bank" Not Approved According to Law; Defense Argues Whether It Qualifies as a Bank

[Our Report] Yesterday afternoon, the court held a hearing on the counterfeit "Anti-Currency," "North Sea Bank" note case, questioning the five defendants: Ye Songmao, Yan Bingshui, Yang Peisheng, Lu Guoshu, and Tang Qifang. The trial was concluded in one session, with the verdict scheduled to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 14th of this month.

On September 20th of this year, the Inspection Department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters uncovered an Anti-Currency (North Sea Bank) printing press at 207 Mongolia Road, arresting five suspects and confiscating printing machines and printing plates. The case attracted much attention, often viewed through a political lens. Zhou Enlai and Chen Jiakang of the Shanghai Office of the Chinese Communist Party immediately issued statements. Subsequently, the Garrison Headquarters transferred the case to the District Procuratorate, which concluded its investigation and filed a public prosecution. The indictment stated that Liu Jianqing and Han Fuyu (two fugitives), friends of the defendant Yang Peisheng, came to Shanghai from the Communist-occupied area of Shandong in July of this year. They brought several 200-yuan notes issued by the North Sea Bank, established by the Communist Party. Being destitute, they discussed with Yang Peisheng the idea of counterfeiting North Sea Bank notes to be used in the Communist areas near Shandong and Xuzhou. Using the notes they had as models, Yang Peisheng introduced Yan Bingshui for printing around September 10th. An initial payment of 1.25 million legal tender was made. Later, Yan Bingshui, having used up the funds and under pressure from Yang Peisheng and others, introduced Ye Songmao (owner of the Ye Fansheng Printing Shop) to print the notes, agreeing to print 40 million face value of North Sea Bank notes at a cost of 1 million legal tender. However, Yan Bingshui falsely claimed to Lu Guoshu that the cost was 2 million, pocketing 1 million. Yan Bingshui supervised the printing. The required funds were guaranteed by Yang Peisheng, who asked his friend Lu Guoshu to borrow from Tang Qifang, who was aware of the situation. A total of over 5.4 million legal tender was borrowed. The paper was purchased by Tang Qifang and delivered by Lu Guoshu and Yang Peisheng to Yan Bingshui for distribution. The printing plates were also delivered by Lu Guoshu to Yang Peisheng and then to Yan Bingshui for Ye Songmao. By the 16th and 17th of the same month, notes with a face value of 20 million had been printed and divided into four packages. Yang Peisheng and Yan Bingshui took them away successively and entrusted them to Lu Guoshu for safekeeping. Liu Jianqing and Han Fuyu took a portion (amount unknown) before the case occurred for use in Communist areas. After the case, Tang Qifang concealed the notes. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters uncovered the case based on a tip.

### Armory Fire Rekindles; Explosions Erupt Again at Night

[Our Report] After a day and night of explosions, the Jiangwan Stadium armory had gradually become quiet by yesterday afternoon. However, around 8 PM last night, the fire rekindled, and a massive bomb exploded, causing renewed disaster. Around 10 PM, there was a brief lull, but at midnight, another explosion occurred, even more violent than in the evening. The continuous rumbling subsided gradually after 1 AM this morning. When the incident occurred again last night, the Jiangwan Police Station telephoned the fire brigade, which dispatched two fire trucks to provide assistance.

### Defendants Claim Coerced Confessions to Garrison Headquarters

During yesterday's court hearing, all five defendants, except for Tang Qifang, were shabbily dressed and cowering in the dock. Under questioning from the court, they denied their statements to the Garrison Headquarters, claiming they were coerced.

Yang Peisheng stated: "I am 30 years old, from Shandong, residing at 13 Songyin Lane, Xixi Road, Nanshi, working as a cigarette vendor. In July of this year, my friends Liu Jianqing and Han Fuyu came to Shanghai from Xuzhou, stating they wanted to print something for a friend and asked if I knew a printing shop. I introduced them to Yan Bingshui, and Liu and Han negotiated directly with him. I did not know beforehand that they were printing Anti-Currency."

### Yan Bingshui Testifies He Only Knew They Were Hell Money

Yan Bingshui stated: "I am 33 years old, from Ningbo, working as a street peddler. In September of this year, Yang Peisheng told me that his friends wanted to print something and introduced me to Ye Songmao, the owner of the Ye Fansheng Printing Shop. I only led them there and they made the arrangements themselves. After the printing was completed, I saw that they were North Sea Bank notes and asked what they were. The person surnamed Liu replied that they were hell money. I asked why they didn't print Republic of China bank notes but North Sea Bank notes. Liu replied that it was a Shandong custom. I received a 10% commission as an intermediary. The agreed amount was 2 million, and I was paid 1 million upfront, but I only received 100,000."

### Printing Shop Owner Greedy for Business

Ye Songmao stated: "I am 37 years old, from Ningbo, and have been running a printing shop for only four or five months. This business was introduced by Yan Bingshui. The person surnamed Liu came and told me it was okay to print. Later, Lu Guoshu brought four printing plates. I printed 50,000 notes of 200 yuan denomination and received a 1 million printing fee. Yan Bingshui and Yang Peisheng wanted a commission and also received 1 million. I have a small printing machine at home, but it was not good for printing. The larger printing machine was brought by Yan Bingshui and Yang Peisheng. When I accepted the job, I knew they were bank notes, but I had never seen this kind of note in Shanghai before. I was ignorant and greedy for business. I hope the court will be lenient."

### Lu Guoshu Burst into Tears Before Speaking

Lu Guoshu burst into tears before speaking, sobbing uncontrollably. He trembled all over while answering questions. He was overly nervous and incoherent, repeatedly saying to the court, "Where was I? Please remind me." Summarizing his statement, he said, "I am 28 years old, from Kunshan, residing at 11 Hengqing Lane, Beile Road, working for the Dalu Trading Company. I met Yang Peisheng at the Great World Amusement Park. Yang said his friend wanted to borrow money to do business. I didn't have any money myself, so I discussed it with my middle school classmate, Tang Qifang. Tang lent 5 million, with a stated interest rate of 20%. I would earn 10%. I knew nothing about printing bank notes. Ye Songmao said things without any basis. The Garrison Headquarters arrested me. I am an honest person. I said that I did lend money for use as printing expenses, but I didn't know anything at all. Ye Songmao is being instructed to accuse me. I am not worried about myself, but I feel sorry for Mr. Tang, who lent 5 million and let me earn 10% interest, intending to help me, but now I have caused him to be involved in a lawsuit, which makes me very sad." He then burst into tears again.

### Tang Qifang Claims He Was Implicated by Lending Money

Tang Qifang stated, "I am 25 years old, from Shanghai, residing at 270 Dongtai Road. Lu Guoshu said his friend was doing solo business and needed funds, so he asked me to lend money. I don't know Yang Peisheng or the others at all. I have been detained for over 80 days due to being implicated. I request to be released on bail."

The debate then began. The defense lawyers hired by Lu and Tang, in addition to arguing the facts, challenged the prosecutor's application of Article 3, Paragraph 1 of the Statute on Punishment for Obstructing National Currency, which was considered inappropriate. The main legal basis cited in the indictment was counterfeiting bank notes. According to the case, the defendants were undoubtedly guilty of "counterfeiting," but the crux of the matter lies in the interpretation of the term "bank notes." The establishment of the "North Sea Bank" was not approved by the central government according to law. Therefore, whether the "North Sea Bank" qualifies as a bank under the law is a question worthy of study. Ye, Yang, and Ye did not have money to hire lawyers, and they were defended by court-appointed defenders who argued that the bank notes printed by the defendants were indeed counterfeit and had no backing. At this point, the debate concluded, and the court scheduled the verdict to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 14th. The five defendants were remanded in custody.

### Innocent Merchants Returned from Burma; No Specific Arrangements for Repatriation; Thinly Clothed and Pitiable Condition

[Our Report] Regarding the British repatriation of over 200 so-called "disorderly soldiers" from Burma, after the Garrison Headquarters determined that most were innocent merchants, the Ministry of National Defense issued a telegram ordering that the weak and infirm be sent back to their hometowns and the able-bodied be drafted into military service. Yu Jianxian, Deputy Director of the Second Department of the Military Service Bureau, was dispatched to Shanghai to handle the matter. After arriving in Shanghai, Yu contacted the Garrison Headquarters last weekend. However, as of yesterday, no concrete steps had been taken. These innocent merchants are still detained in the Garrison Headquarters detention center, mostly thinly clothed. In this cold weather, the Garrison Headquarters has no prison uniforms and cannot issue military uniforms. It can only provide cotton blankets to keep them warm, which is extremely pitiful. It is also reported that many have families back in their hometowns and requested to be exempted from military service and repatriated. Yesterday, ten merchants from the Yunnan border jointly submitted a petition, which the authorities are considering.

### How Much Trash Do You Produce Each Day? Health Bureau Director Says 1.2 Pounds

[Our Special] Readers, how much trash did you produce yesterday?

Don't find my question abrupt. My question is based on information. According to the Health Bureau's announcement yesterday, "The city's population has exceeded four million, with each person producing 1.2 pounds of trash per day."

The entire city of Shanghai "produces" 2,400 tons of trash daily. 1,400 tons are transported by barge to Sanlintang, and the remaining 1,000 tons are transported by trucks, horse-drawn carts, collapsing carts, and handcarts to the suburbs to fill depressions and ditches.

There are currently 3,257 sanitation workers. Director Zhang said, "Before the war, there was one sanitation worker for every 450 residents in the Public Concession. Now, there is only one sanitation worker for every 1,100 residents."

Director Zhang also talked about "sanitation policies." He said, "The sanitation policy of the concession era prioritized operations first and money second. The sanitation policy of the enemy and puppet regime was to sweep without transporting, piling up garbage on the roadside like mountains."

What is Director Zhang's sanitation policy? It is "economy first, work second." Below is Director Zhang's statistics: Sanitation workers sweep 2.2 city miles of road per day, 66 miles per month, averaging a remuneration of 1,383 yuan per mile.

Garbage workers haul 1.5 tons of trash per day, 45 tons per month, averaging a remuneration of 2,186.50 yuan per ton.

How can work efficiency be improved and promote the city's cleanliness?

Director Zhang's report says, "To make the horse run diligently, it is necessary to feed the horse grass."

Statistics on Cleanliness Issues

### Health Bureau Hosts Press Conference, Promotes Importance of National Health; 30,000 Children Examined, Only One-Tenth Healthy; Over One Hundred Doctors Willing to Provide Free Treatment

[Our Report] Yesterday afternoon, at 4:00 PM, the Health Bureau hosted a press conference for reporters in the Municipal Government’s bureau conference room. Director Zhang Wei of the bureau reported on the importance of national health. The slogan of powerful countries in Europe and America is currently, "Health first, children first." They are making every effort to research eugenics. If our country does not catch up quickly, the future is unimaginable. Therefore, representatives of the recent National Health Administration Conference, namely Chen Wanli, Director of the Health Department of Jiangsu Province, Xu Shilun, Director of the Health Department of Zhejiang Province, Wang Zuxiang, Director of the Health Bureau of Nanjing, and Zhang Wei, Director of the Health Bureau of Shanghai, jointly submitted a letter to the National Assembly, suggesting that when discussing the constitution, a clause guaranteeing the "People's Right to Health" be added to the chapter on the rights and obligations of the people to establish a foundation of prosperity and well-being for the hundreds of millions of people in China. They also requested that the National Assembly representatives in various regions take on the responsibility of promoting this to the people to make the people understand the importance of national health for the country.

Chen Bangxian, Director of the Epidemic Prevention Department, reported on the recent work of the department, saying that winter is a quiet period for epidemics. The main work is to strengthen organization and formulate guidelines to prepare for the future. To prevent the spread of diseases, the epidemic prevention tax attached to the house tax is used to purchase a large number of trash cans, 335 of which have been manufactured. These are being rushed into production. In addition, the Public Works Bureau has been asked to add free water faucets and increase artesian wells to minimize infectious diseases next year.

Subsequently, the Director of the Health Care Department of the Bureau reported on the progress of the Health Promotion Competition, stating that as of now, 69,570 people have registered, including 48,749 children and 20,821 young people. However, there is a particularly small participation rate from infants and toddlers. The Health Bureau believes that the health competition is mainly for infants. Therefore, it was decided to extend the registration deadline for infants and toddlers to the end of December, hoping that the fathers and mothers in this city will automatically go to participate.

Up to yesterday, 33,971 people had undergone initial examinations for the health competition. The examination results showed that only 11% were healthy and flawless. Among them, tonsillitis accounted for 22%, trachoma accounted for 51%, dental diseases accounted for 32%, skin diseases accounted for 6%, phimosis accounted for 13%, and malnutrition accounted for 20%. Anyone suffering from the above defects can receive free treatment from the Health Bureau. The bureau is contacting various doctors for assistance. It is reported that 151 dentists are willing to set aside half a day each week to provide free dental treatment for participants. In addition, trachoma, skin diseases, etc., will be actively treated next spring. Tonsillectomies are expected to be performed free of charge next spring. The bureau has also purchased a large number of cod liver oil and milk powder, which will be distributed to those suffering from malnutrition.

### Twenty-Five Years Dedicated to Popular Education: Dr. Y.C. James Yen's Touching and Profound Account of Smooth Progress, Every Word Filled with Concern for the People

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] "For many years, our country has advocated literacy campaigns, agricultural revitalization, and the promotion of democratic politics. But what has been achieved so far? Whether it is our government or we as individuals, we have made a big mistake – that mistake is that we have not paid attention to the grassroots. As a result, although there are many proposals, the people who advocate them have only formed many small cliques and have not engaged with the broad masses of the people. The common people are still living a primitive life!"

Dr. Y.C. James Yen could not help but feel emotional when talking about this trend of "neglecting the fundamentals and pursuing the superficial." Although there were already many silver strands in Mr. Yen's hair, his passion made him look eternally young. He spoke smoothly about the progress of popular education, his voice clear and calm, every word filled with concern for the people. Hearing his sincere teachings, I was deeply moved.

Achieving Broad Results Through Appropriate Methods

Mr. Yen said, "I have been engaged in popular education for twenty-five years. I deeply feel that the most important thing for those of us engaged in popular education is to discover various feasible methods, and then teach these methods to the common people. Implementation requires the broad masses of the people to take action themselves. The common people are not unwilling to accept new methods, but these new methods must meet three conditions: first, they must be simple, otherwise they will not be easily understood; second, they must be practical, otherwise they will not listen to you; and third, they must be economical and save money, so that they are happy to give it a try.

Many things require knowledge, not money. For example, when we first went to Ding County, smallpox and neonatal tetanus were very prevalent. We treated them and told them about hygiene, and soon achieved results. The so-called neonatal tetanus is because local midwives did not understand hygiene and used unclean scissors to cut the umbilical cord of infants. Naturally, the infants were susceptible to disease, often suffering from spasms around the fourth or sixth day after birth, eventually leading to death. After we arrived, we found many young women in Ding County, taught them midwifery knowledge, and had them tell all the women in the county that when giving birth, they must first boil the scissors in water before using them. After three years, there were no more cases of neonatal tetanus in Ding County. No one died from smallpox either. So, we can know that when we go to the people, we don't have to do everything ourselves, but we have to tell them various appropriate methods and let them do it themselves. Only in this way can we mobilize many people and achieve broad results."

Arousing the Interest of the Common People: Ensuring They Have Food

How can we promote popular education now? Mr. Yen said, "The country is currently unstable, and it is impossible to do it on a large scale. But now is a good time to conserve energy, organize teaching materials, and collect teaching aids, so that everything is ready when it is needed. When large-scale implementation is carried out in the future, we plan to divide the country into several regions, conduct demonstrations in several central locations, and train supervisors and teachers, and then gradually promote it. It doesn't take long, four or five years will be able to make significant progress."

How can we arouse the interest of the common people in learning? Mr. Yen said, "Can we use movies and dramas to stimulate them? Mr. Xiong Fuxi, Mr. Yang Cunbin, Mr. Zhao Yuanren, and Mr. Sun Fuguo have all contributed a lot in this area." "We not only want to teach them to read, but most importantly, we want to teach them to have food to eat. When they are not full, you can teach them anything and they will not be interested. So, when we first arrived in Ding County, we first taught them how to improve farming methods. Ding County produces cotton. When we first arrived, they could only do 120,000 yuan of business each year, but after a few years, it jumped to 1.5 million - this was before the war, and 1.5 million was a considerable amount. But later we found that this was not enough, and the common people still needed economic organization. So, we taught them to form many cooperatives, so that they could organize themselves in transportation, sales, and purchasing. The exploitation of middlemen was gone, and the common people got real benefits."

Recalling the Past by the Hearth: The Success of the Ding County Experiment

Mr. Yen said excitedly, "They first improved production, and then they had an economic organization. Then we tried our best to promote healthcare, and the common people naturally demanded autonomy. They can't ignore their own affairs, and no one can stop them from managing their own affairs. The ultimate goal of popular education is popular politics - and 'popular politics' is 'democracy'!"

Because the Ding County experiment was successful, popular education centers and health centers were also established throughout China. Also because Mr. Yen and his colleagues emphasized the importance of the "county," this basic administrative organization also received widespread attention, and the "New County System" and "Experimental County" were born.

Mr. Yen said, "Back then, students from Tsinghua, Yenching, Peking Union Medical College, and Jinling University often came to Ding County for internships. Those studying politics went to work in the county government, and those studying agriculture joined the farm. This was the beginning of 'internships' for Chinese university students before graduation."

The fire in the guest room was burning brightly, and Mr. Yen thought of Ding County amidst the shadow of the chrysanthemum. "In September 1937, we were driven out of Ding County. But although we left, our methods remained in Ding County. During the war, an American reader visited many guerrilla areas and said: The most tightly organized and the most heroic in resisting Japan was the Ding County guerrilla!"

### Hu Wenyuan Denies Rumors Against the Finance Bureau

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Finance Bureau was ordered to assess and collect housing tax and municipal construction tax throughout the city. The Assessment Division dispatched more than 100 people to conduct investigations by district, which has lasted for more than two months. The investigators are composed of 70 students from the Central Political School and more than 40 people transferred from the Land Administration Bureau. Recently, rumors have circulated that the investigators are indignant that Division Chief He Ge privately used attendance fees for interest payments, and will petition Mayor Wu and the Municipal Council. In response, the reporter inquired with Deputy Director Hu Wenyuan of the Bureau. Deputy Director Hu solemnly stated that this matter is absolutely untrue. Hu said that the Bureau directly issues receipts for all salary expenditures through the Accounting Office, and has never entrusted any person in charge with the distribution of funds. The payment of salaries and allowances for the investigators is subject to audit.

### Robber of Cotton Mill Arrested in Hotel

[Report from Our Newspaper] The robbers who robbed the Xinsheng Cotton Mill at 312 Zhengdong Road the night before, in addition to two who were caught on the spot, the remaining three robbers escaped to the roof after fighting. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Afterwards, the Huangpu Branch launched a thorough investigation overnight. It was not until noon yesterday that they received a report that the fugitive robbers were hiding in Room 114 of the Continental Hotel on Xichang Road. The original police officers immediately went to the address. The robbers had not yet returned, so they first ambushed in Room 113 to wait. At 12:10, a robber hurried into Room 114. After entering the room, he closed the door tightly. Plainclothes police officer Zhao Jiake obtained the key from the tea waiter and bravely opened the door and entered. The robber was about to draw his gun to resist when he was stopped by the police officers and surrendered. A quick-slow machine gun was seized on the spot, containing seven bullets, which had already been loaded. After being taken to the police station for interrogation, he confessed that his name was Chen Ada, also known as San Gou, and admitted to participating in the robbery of the Xinsheng Cotton Mill. The remaining two robbers are still being pursued.

### First Meeting on Salvaging Sunken Ships: Initial Capital Set at 200 Million Yuan, Salvage Equipment to be Leased from UNRRA

[Report from Our Newspaper] The first meeting of the Committee for the Salvage of Sunken Ships was convened by Director Li Guofan of the Shipping Administration Bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday in the Bureau's conference room. Representatives from the Disposal Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Jianghai Customs, Naval Headquarters, Shipping Industry Association, and experts Ou Ye and Wei Wenhan attended. It is learned that concrete measures, internal organization, and responsible personnel for the establishment of the salvage company have been decided and will be submitted to the regular meeting of the Port Affairs Reorganization Committee to be held this Wednesday. Contacts will be made with relevant parties from today onwards.

The initial capital and office expenses of the salvage company are set at 200 million yuan in legal tender, to be borne by the Disposal Bureau, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Shipping Industry Association, and the Association's members. The salvage equipment was originally planned to be purchased from UNRRA, but the discussion yesterday concluded that leasing is better than purchasing. As for the lease price, it will be determined according to the purchase price or by drawing a percentage from the salvage company's profits. Negotiations with UNRRA are still needed. If the salvage funds are insufficient, loans will be requested from UNRRA according to the loan measures for salvaging and repairing sunken ships.

The specific targets for salvaging sunken ships and the methods for signing salvage contracts will be drafted by experts.

### Reader Consultation, Legal Questions

(1) Marrying Two Women

Chen Dahao asks: My father's surname was Zhang, and he passed away long ago. There are three siblings. I am the eldest. I was adopted into my mother's family as a grandson at the age of five. I married nine years ago and have no children. My sister also married a long time ago. Unexpectedly, my younger brother died three years ago without starting a family, resulting in no one to inherit the family name. Therefore, for the sake of the Zhang family, I want to marry another wife as an heir to the Zhang family. I don't know if this would be considered bigamy under the law, and whether my wife has the right to interfere. Can I marry the second wife openly? After marrying two women, will there be a distinction between wife and concubine? I hope you can answer the above points.

[Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin answers] The law clearly stipulates penalties for those who are already married and remarry, as well as those who cohabit in marriage. If it is for the sake of the Zhang family's descendants, you can marry a woman and cohabit, but there should be no marriage ceremony, which is the ancient custom of a concubine or side room. The children born will be the same as legitimate children.

(2) Inheritance After Marriage

(2) I heard that daughters who married while their father was alive have no right to demand to share the property. Is this true? (3) Can the unmarried third and fourth sisters have the right to inherit property? If so, what is the ratio with A? (4) Is the right to demand inheritance of property permanent, or is there a time limit?

[Lawyer Chuan Shenlin answers] (1) They have the same right to inherit the estate. (2) Same as the answer to question 1. (3) The number of shares to be inherited should be divided equally according to the number of people. (4) It expires ten years after the date of death of the inherited person.

### The Key to Eliminating Black Market for Cotton Yarn Lies in Private Spinning Mills. Manufacturers Unsatisfied with Control Measures, Set Up Subcommittee to Draft New Plan

[Our Newspaper] Regarding how to regulate the yarn and cloth market and reduce the black market, a draft plan was formed at the weekly meeting of the Cotton Spinning Control Committee last Thursday based on the opinions of the participating members. It is now reported that when the case was submitted to President Song for approval yesterday, President Song reviewed it once. However, in the end, it was felt that private factories often failed to thoroughly implement the plans previously drafted by the Cotton Spinning Control Committee. In order to implement the entire yarn and cloth strategy, the government has decided to find ways to provide as much foreign exchange as possible for the cotton required for purchases. However, in reality, the private factories must draft an implementable plan and submit it to President Song for approval before it can be implemented. President Song's intention was conveyed by Wu Qian, the Chairman of the Cotton Spinning Control Committee, to Wang Qiyu, the Chairman of the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association.

The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association convened an extraordinary meeting of members at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Seventy or eighty representatives from various member factories attended, chaired by Wang Qiyu. Wang said that the government had decided to provide as much raw cotton as possible. The factories should properly understand the government's intentions regarding the disposal of the cotton yarn they produce and should not dispose of it too freely. Wang proposed four points: (1) Restore free trade. (2) Restore the spinning building listing system. (3) Set standard prices for yarns of various counts. (4) For the US cotton required by each factory, adopt the method of exchanging yarn for cotton, with the principle of one bag of yarn for one bag of cotton. However, the representatives present did not agree with the points raised by Wang. Some representatives believed that the current cotton yarn control measures agreed upon by the Cotton Spinning Control Committee were too restrictive. At the same time, they also believed that the purchase of foreign cotton should be opened up, allowing each yarn factory to purchase freely. The cotton yarn produced should also be freely transported and sold by each yarn factory. If there are exports, the resulting foreign exchange can be sold to the government as compensation.

In the end, it was decided that under the principle of free trade, the economic future of the country should be taken into account, the principle of suppressing yarn prices, and the legal profits and business development of the yarn factories should be protected. A proper plan was drafted, and Tang Xinghai, Guo Qiong, Rong Yixin, Liu Jingji, Lu Zidong, Xi Yushu, and nine others were elected to form a subcommittee to draft the entire plan. The subcommittee is scheduled to meet at 10:00 AM today.

The C bond opened at 1,200 yuan in the morning, and gradually dropped to 1,030 yuan midway. Finally, it fluctuated between 1,130 yuan and 1,150 yuan. As a result, it fell by 140 yuan compared with the previous close. The A and B bonds each fell by 150 yuan, the D bond by a small amount of 170 yuan, and the E bond fell by 180 yuan. The transaction volume was 5 million yuan.

### Rice Market Firm, Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes Flat and Weak

The total arrival of rice and grain in the north and south markets was about 15,000 stones. Sales were flat. Both the north and south markets were tight in the morning and weak in the afternoon. The momentum was unable to recover. Northern Japonica rice was slightly weaker. Southern Japonica rice softened in the middle. Indica rice was still firm due to the scarcity of goods. White Yin Yuan was also mediocre. For the time being, there was little change in various goods. Soybean appetite in the local market turned positive, rebounding by 300 to 1,000 yuan. There were few transactions in bean cake from Shantou, Xiamen, and Fujian. Market prices also fluctuated little. Wheat bran was depressed and fell by another 100 to 200 yuan. There was no change in flour. The oil market opened weak in the morning. At noon, the shop appetite turned strong. As a result, various oils had little glory or disgrace compared with Saturday. Wheat was firm, the flour market was flat. Green beans from Nanyang were still available, and the market was active. Raw peanuts from the Guangdong gang moved slightly, and prices rebounded by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Sesame was firm and stable due to the scarcity of personnel. Red sorghum tended to be firm. Broad beans were more smoothly retailed in the local market, rising by 1,000 yuan. The appetite for corn from Qingdao was very strong, but there was a lack of both arrivals and inventory in the Shanghai area. There were no goods on the market, and the situation was moving towards a peak.

### Yarn Market Mediocre

Yesterday's yarn market was neither good nor bad. The sales of 20-count yarn were mediocre. Those holding the goods were eager to sell, so they continued to slightly lower the price by 10,000 to 20,000. 32-count fine yarn was absorbed by Anhui merchants, and the price was quite good. The fabric factories' woven products remained sluggish as before, resulting in a sluggish and weak market for 42-count yarn.

### Protecting the Seasoning Powder Industry, Seasoning Powder is Prohibited from Import

The city's Seasoning Powder Industry Association stated that the production of the original domestic seasoning powder manufacturing plants is sufficient to supply consumption throughout the country. Before the war and in the early days of the War of Resistance, it still had the capacity to expand its market in the Nanyang Islands. However, recently, due to the impact of the continuous import of foreign goods, business has declined sharply, and factories have been forced to reduce production. If this continues, the entire seasoning powder industry is in danger of bankruptcy. They have stated their reasons to the Temporary Import Management Committee, requesting that seasoning powder be prohibited from import. It is now known that the association has received a reply approving the prohibition of imports.

### Coal Balls Hoarding and Price Increase, Authorities Have Begun Registration

The Fuel Management Committee, considering that the black market for coal balls in the city is rampant and has a significant impact on people's livelihoods, decided to allocate 10,000 tons of bituminous coal to meet the coal needs. The allocation will be coordinated and distributed by the Coal Industry Joint Distribution Office. It is reported that the allocated coal can be shipped this week. The price of household coal balls has soared in recent days, reaching about double the original price. The authorities believe that this is speculators taking the opportunity to hoard and raise prices. An investigation has now begun.

### Securities Exchange Pilots Arbitrage Trading

Designated Yongsha and Xinho Two Types

In order to facilitate arbitrage trading, the Securities Exchange has stipulated the implementation measures for arbitrage trading and will pilot the measures starting from the morning session on the 12th of this month (Thursday). The regulations are recorded below:

(1) The types of stocks are tentatively set at Yongsha and Xinho.

(2) Trading positions: When both parties are conducting arbitrage trading, trading will be concentrated in front of the designated trading counter. (If the other party is conducting ordinary trading, trading will still be conducted in front of the respective trading counters in accordance with the original buying and selling methods.)

(3) Minimum trading unit: Tentatively set at 50,000 shares

(4) Pricing unit: Set at one dime.

(5) Pricing method: The difference between the spot price and the deferred delivery price is quoted, such as 8 yuan and 1 dime, 9 yuan and 3 dimes, etc.

(6) Transaction price: Based on the current spot buying price at the time. For example, if the arbitrage bid is 8 yuan and the transaction is completed, and the current spot buying price is 450 yuan, the current spot price is 450 yuan, and the deferred delivery price is 458 yuan.

(7) Price fluctuation limit: Based on the spot price (limited to transactions in which both parties are conducting arbitrage).

(8) Buying and selling gestures: Based on the delivery of deferred delivery. For example, to buy spot and sell deferred delivery, the palm faces outward. To sell spot and buy deferred delivery, the palm faces inward.

(9) Completion of forms: The current forms are used, distinguishing between spot and deferred delivery. The seller still completes the form as usual and submits it to the trading counter after being signed by the buyer.

(10) Other items: The margin, delivery of current goods, additional margin, handling fee, transaction tax, and delivery procedures and delivery deadlines are all handled in accordance with the original spot and deferred delivery methods. Account statements are also calculated together, without the need to complete them separately.

### Repeated Shortage of Allotted Yarn Creates Difficulties During Re-allocation by the Secondary Distribution Committee

The Secondary Product Industry Yarn Allocation Committee, for the second allocation of yarn in the fourth period, yesterday (the 9th) verified the allocation to the nine public associations under its jurisdiction based on the forms submitted by the Cotton Textile Association. These associations will distribute the yarn to their respective member factories in the next two days. According to sources at the Secondary Distribution Committee, the yarn received this period totaled 4,760 bales, which, according to the new ratio, is equivalent to 5,741.61 bales of 20-count standard yarn. This is a shortage of over 250 bales compared to the quota of 6,000 bales. If calculated according to the original ratio, the shortage would be even greater. There was also a shortage of over 200 bales of yarn in the previous period. The Cotton Textile Industry Yarn Allocation Committee resolved to seek additional yarn at its meeting last week, but this has not been resolved. Moreover, over a thousand bales of 10-count yarn have been returned over time, and repeated requests have been made to the Textile Control Committee to allocate 20-count common yarn to meet practical needs and cover the shortage, but there has been no response. The cotton industry generally believes that there is no need to allocate additional yarn because the returned yarn includes common yarn. However, the Secondary Distribution Committee argues that the return of suitable cotton yarn is only due to the individual actions of a very small number of members who lack sufficient funds, and does not mean that there is a surplus in the total amount. They are still requesting additional allocation. It is unknown how the Textile Control Committee will handle this. The actual yarn allocated to member factories of various industries this time will be even less than in the previous period. The factories are quite critical of their respective public associations, and the persons in charge of the public associations feel even more troubled. Among them, it is difficult to cope with the 20-count and 42-count double-ply common yarn. According to Fan Shihao, the person in charge of the Secondary Distribution Committee, since the conversion ratio of yarn counts was changed to the new standard, the finer counts have almost uniformly been reduced to 90% of the previous several allocations. The total shortage for two consecutive periods is over 200 bales each, and the return of 10-count yarn has not been resolved for a long time. The difficult situation of the various public associations deserves attention. They are compiling statistics and presenting reasons to the Textile Control Committee to request an increase in the allocation quota to address the urgent need.

### Five Types of Public Bonds, Including the "Relief" Bond, to Be Redeemed by Lottery Today

### Two Major Threats to the Match Industry: Too Many Smuggled Goods and Excessively High Taxes; Recent Plans to Open Up Sales Market in South China

[Report from this Newspaper] The matches produced in this city are mainly supplied to this city and the Beijing-Shanghai area. The main market for export has been North China. However, there are recent plans to expand the market in South China, although the specific quantity has not yet been determined. According to relevant sources, the production volume of matches in this city has not increased significantly compared to two or three months ago. There are two major threats to the match industry in our country at present: (1) There are many smuggled goods, and the customs' crackdown is not very effective. The Ministry of Finance now attaches great importance to this matter and has instructed the Goods Tax Bureau to inform the Match Industry Association to collect smuggling information and report it in detail for reference. (2) The tax burden is too heavy. For example, in terms of goods tax, the tax rate for cotton yarn is less than 10%, while the tax rate for matches is 20%. This is because the financial authorities regard cotton yarn as a necessity, while matches are considered to be mostly used for lighting cigarettes and are classified as luxury goods. Moreover, the income and profit tax allocated in the 34th year (1945) was as high as 150 million yuan, but according to people in the industry, the actual profit was less than 100 million yuan. Based on this calculation, the tax rate is as high as 150% or more! Therefore, the match industry is currently brewing a petition to reduce taxes, which may be successful soon. As for the match industry as a whole, the situation of large factories is still good, and a large match factory in this city plans to purchase the enemy-puppet match factory in Qingdao with huge funds. However, it is difficult for small factories to maintain operations, and they regard the end of the year as a difficult hurdle to overcome.

### Sluggish Tea Market Transactions

In the foreign merchant tea market, British export firms still demanded high-grade aged Keemun yesterday. Unfortunately, goods were scarce and supply was limited, creating a stalemate. Transactions were few and far between. Prices, however, remained stable. Although American merchants also watched the standard first grade "Ta Ruo Wu Se Ping Shui Xin Da Bang," their prices were not at all flexible. Exports have been quiet for a long time. The Tea Merchants Association of this city once telegraphed overseas requesting higher prices, but the results were like a stone sinking into the sea, with no news. Based on the current situation, the sale of Chinese tea to the United States is unlikely to expand in the short term. As for green teas such as "Chou Zhen" and "Zhen Mei" sold to Morocco and other places in Africa, it is still not easy to sell low-grade goods. Due to the disparity in domestic and foreign prices for high-quality goods and the lack of ships, the situation has also been very sluggish recently. Domestic sales of various green teas have not yet recovered. Looking at the trend, it seems to be precarious.

### Approved Amount of Yarn and Cloth to Be Shipped to the South

[Report from this Newspaper] The amount of yarn and cloth approved by the Textile Control Committee to be shipped to the South this month is 2,967 bales of yarn and 75,647 bolts of cloth. Including the remaining amount from the previous month's applications, which is 834 bales of yarn and 8,586 bolts of cloth, the total amount to be shipped this month is 3,801 bales of yarn and 84,233 bolts of cloth. The notification letters to the manufacturers can be sent out today. After receiving them, they can start applying.

### Cotton Inventory Registration Completed

The registration of cotton inventory by the Textile Control Committee, which began last week, has been completed by various silk factories, cotton trading houses, and foreign firms. The authorities are determining the total amount of raw cotton needed by the yarn factories in the future. Bei Zuyi, the President of the Central Bank, and Shu Yunjhang, among others, visited President Song this morning around 10:00 AM to report on the progress of the cotton inventory registration and to discuss important matters regarding the opening of U.S. dollar foreign exchange to solve the raw cotton problem. The meeting lasted for quite some time. Furthermore, Mr. Song was also very concerned about the sharp rise in gold prices and inquired in detail of Mr. Bei about the recent situation of curbing gold prices.

Another report: The Cotton Industry Association submitted the registered cotton inventory of the cotton trading houses in this city to the Textile Control Committee for review on the morning of the 9th. According to the statistics of this cotton inventory registration, there are 100,000 *zu* of spot cotton, 11,000 *zu* of standard cotton, and over 300,000 *dan* of contracted cotton, of which 11,000 *dan* of standard cotton will arrive in Shanghai within days.

### Representatives of the Wool Textile Industry Petition in Beijing, Requesting Amendment of the Goods Tax

[Report from this Newspaper] Cheng Chepeng, the chairman of the Shanghai Wool, Velvet, Textile, Dyeing Industry Association, along with directors Tang Junyuan, Ge Jiecun, Tang Yeru, Ye Fukan, Wu Shangeng, and secretary Yang Liren, a group of seven people, took the night express train to Beijing last night, representing the industry to petition the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Taxation Department on two points: (1) The goods tax levied on the industry was originally aimed at woolen fabrics, but now it is proposed to change it to woolen yarn. (2) The goods tax rate for woolen yarn is as high as 15%, while the rate for cotton yarn is only 5%. Both belong to clothing raw materials, so it is proposed that the tax rates should be treated equally. It is reported that the representatives will stay in Beijing for two or three days.

### Large Shipment of Foreign Paper Arrives

[Report from this Newspaper] The "Deike" freighter, managed by the Tianxiang Foreign Firm, arrived in Shanghai at noon the day before yesterday, carrying 1,700 tons of foreign paper from the United States, and 2,270 bales of cotton from Hong Kong. It berthed at the Longmao Warehouse for unloading.

### Industrial and Commercial Recession Leads to Sluggish Stock Market

The Shanghai stock market experienced widespread pessimism yesterday, with unfavorable conditions. Due to a lack of interest in holding onto stocks, transactions were scarce, and prices were more likely to fall than rise. At the opening, various stocks showed slight declines. After the opening, the scene was bleak. Stocks such as 70, 198, 186, 207, and 36 were sold off, as demand far exceeded supply. Prices gradually decreased. After 10:15, some financial institutions, such as 110 and 47, engaged in arbitrage when prices were low, which stabilized the market slightly. However, stock 186 heavily sold Mei Ya and Yong Yarn, and stock 89 pressured the market with short selling. Although stocks 215 and 211 occasionally bought aggressively, the overall trend could not be reversed. Later, stock 157 sold China Silk to the limit down, and stock 148 also forced Mei Ya to the limit down, making the market even more fearful. After 11:30, stocks 35 and 196 sold spot Yong Yarn, and stocks 186, 151, 89, and 207 sold forward Yong Yarn. The market looked the most fatigued at the close. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yong Yarn, Mei Ya, Xin He, Jing Fu, Xin Guang, and Qin Xing fell by about 10%, Hua Feng fell by 5%, the cold stock Datong rose slightly, Zhong Fang fell slightly, China Silk fell to the limit down, Wu He remained flat, and the rest fell by 5% to 10%. Forward Mei Ya and Xin He fell by more than 10%, Yong Yarn, Jing Fu, and Xin Guang fell by 10%, and Qin Xing and Hua Feng fell by 5%. In the afternoon, continuing the trend from the morning, the market became even more sluggish. Mei Ya first fell to the limit down. Yong Yarn once broke the 400 yuan mark. After falling to a low, it was slightly supplemented by stock 70 and others, and the market hovered and stabilized. At the close, because the cold stocks gradually showed signs of strength, they were driven up. Tong Yi rose by 50 yuan at the close, which was the most eye-catching. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yong Yarn and Jing Fu fell by slightly less than 10%, Hua Feng fell by 5%, Mei Ya, Xin He, and Xin Guang each fell by slightly more than 10%, the cold stock Tong Yi alone rose by 10%, Datong rose slightly, Zhong Fang fell slightly, China Silk fell to the limit down in the morning, and the rest fell by 5% to 10%. Forward Yong Yarn, Xin He, Jing Fu, and Xin Guang each fell by 10%, Mei Ya fell by 15%, and Dong Xing and Hua Feng fell by 5%. Over-the-counter stocks fell again.

Foreign stocks were even more dismal yesterday. Under the circumstance that no one paid attention, they reported a complete collapse again. Except for small stocks, the decline was more severe. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Paper Industry, Navigation, and Ewo Brewery fell slightly, Jardine Matheson and Wheelock Marden fell by 5%, and Ewo Cotton Mill and British-American Tobacco each fell by about 10%.

### The Gap Between the Official Exchange Rate and the Black Market is Too Large; Remittances From Overseas Chinese are Evaded by Tens of Thousands of People; Bank of China is Actively Trying to Prevent This

Remittances from overseas Chinese are related to the balance of international payments. The Bank of China has made its best efforts to assist and facilitate them. However, the situation of remittances from overseas Chinese has not improved. In recent months, they have been declining. Although there was a slight improvement in August due to the relaxation of foreign exchange controls, they declined again in October. There are no statistics for November, but the Bank of China's income from remittances from overseas Chinese is not as high as in October. The situation is still continuously deteriorating, and the situation is extremely serious. According to investigations by relevant parties, the amount of remittances from overseas Chinese evaded between Hong Kong and Guangzhou reaches 10 million U.S. dollars per month. The amount is so huge that it is shocking. According to the report of the Bank of China, before February of this year, the income from remittances from overseas Chinese was 5 million U.S. dollars per month. After the opening of foreign exchange in March, it gradually decreased. Now it is only 2 million U.S. dollars, a difference of three-fifths, which has become an extremely serious problem at present. It is learned that, regarding the reasons for the evasion of remittances from overseas Chinese, the Bank of China's research concluded that it is nothing more than

(1) The speed of remittances. However, Guangzhou, Xiamen, and other places can directly remit money abroad. Remittances from New York can arrive in two days at most. It only takes two or three hours from Guangzhou to Siyi. Postal remittances can arrive in two weeks or ten days at most. Telegraphic transfers and postal remittances have all returned to the pre-war state, so this problem is no longer a problem.

(2) The exchange rate problem. The official exchange rate set by the government is 3,350, while the black market rate has risen to around 5,000. The official rate is too low, and the black market is too high. This is the biggest factor in the evasion of remittances from overseas Chinese.

The methods of evasion are based on two types of remittances, USD checks and HKD checks. The former, USD checks, were originally intended for transfers from town A to town B in the US. These checks, which are good only for payment when transferred from San Francisco to New York, are now circulated in Guangzhou. The locals call it "Tongtian Dipaper", and openly trade it. Besides merchants, wealthy families are also buying the USD checks. Merchants are able to use the checks to make payments in USD back in the U.S. The merchants are importing private goods, and the imports cannot be settled through official foreign exchange procedures. The merchants buy the USD checks to settle the imports. The cost is lower than the free-market USD exchange rate. If the free-market USD exchange rate is 5,000 yuan, the merchants can purchase USD checks at 4,000 yuan. Therefore, the merchants use USD checks instead of official foreign exchange procedures. The wealthy families buy the USD checks and deposit the funds in the U.S., which helps to keep "Tongtian Dipaper" circulating. The latter, HKD checks, can be used to obtain cash in Hong Kong, since there is still a gap between the official and free-market HKD exchange rates. If the people don't go to Hong Kong to obtain cash, they can still trade HKD checks in Guangzhou. Therefore, the evasion of remittances from overseas Chinese is closely related to smuggling. The Bank of China is aware of this and is actively trying to rescue the situation. It is preparing prevention measures against the evasion of remittances from overseas Chinese, based on the current situation. Regarding the HKD check problem, the Bank of China and the Central Bank have agreed to set a new official exchange rate for purchasing HKD based on the free-market HKD exchange rate in Guangzhou. The "Tongtian Dipaper" issue is still being studied.

It is learned that the Association is also soliciting the Municipal Government to change the name of Dongtiyu Road, where the school's First College is located, to He Bingsong Road, in order to commemorate him.

### Letter Correction

A while ago, the number of musical instruments used for the Wu Xun Memorial Meeting in your newspaper on the 6th of this month wrongly stated that I am a professor at Datong University. I am currently in charge of the affairs of the Chinese People's Livelihood Construction Experimental Institute and do not teach at Datong University. Please correct this. Sincerely, Tai Shuangqiu (12, 6)

### Ministry of Education Orders Legal Screening of Graduates from St. John's and Lester Schools; Students Admitted to Study Abroad Must Submit Proof of Passing Screening

[Report from this Newspaper] The Lester Technical College in this city was established by British people. During the period of occupation, it was taken over by the Japanese and renamed the East Asia Technical College. In addition, the private St. John's University continued to operate during the occupation. After the victory, the school's board of directors is applying to the Ministry of Education for registration. It has been heard that the Shanghai District Screening Committee of the Ministry of Education has had difficulty determining the qualifications of graduates from the two schools and has submitted a request to the Ministry of Education for verification. Recently, it was heard that the committee has received Directive No. 31893 of the Ministry of Education: "Graduates from the private St. John's University and Lester Technical College should still be handled in accordance with the screening procedures. As for the public-funded and self-funded students from each school who participated in the study abroad examination and were admitted, they must submit proof of passing the screening. As for the graduates of St. John's University, they must wait until the school is registered before they can exchange for study abroad certificates."

### American Nine Presidents' Letters: Donation to Library

[United States Information Service, New York, 9th] The director of Columbia University Library announced that Dr. Butler, the honorary retired president of the university, recently donated to the university library seventeen volumes of his personal correspondence with nine former and incumbent presidents of the United States. Dating from 1891 to 1946, these volumes include original letters from Presidents McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, Taft, Wilson, Harding, Coolidge, Hoover, Franklin Roosevelt, and Truman, along with copies of Dr. Butler's replies. The correspondence with Presidents Hoover and Truman has not been bound into volumes, as Dr. Butler stated in an accompanying letter that continued correspondence with these two men was possible. He also said, "I hope that these letters will be kept completely secret during my lifetime, and thereafter, according to library regulations, be available for research and reference by scholars and students of American political history. They likely contain materials that are completely unknown to the outside world."

### Hong Kong Boxing King Jiang Haoquan, Renowned in Chongqing, to Have Boxing Match

[Our Newspaper] After a period of enthusiasm, boxing competitions have recently subsided with the cold winds. During the amateur and professional bouts between the Chung Ching and Jewish teams, few noticed that a renowned boxing king was watching from the sidelines. This observer was none other than Hong Kong's boxing king Jiang Haoquan, who is renowned in Chongqing.

Mr. Jiang is 27 years old, a native of Changzhou, Jiangsu Province. He is 1.75 meters tall and weighs 160 pounds. His physique is extremely well-developed, with well-developed pectoral muscles, shoulder muscles, deltoid muscles, and biceps. He has defeated British professional boxer Elmbert, amateur boxing tiger Tai Mi Imanse, Qiu Huigensen, and American Springfield University boxing champion White Keqin, among others. Mr. Jiang is not only good at Western boxing, but he has also defeated several veterans in wrestling. He is also a good tap dancer, and he won the diving competition at the Guilin Swimming Competition on his way from Hong Kong to Chongqing. Today, our reporter visited Mr. Jiang on Baoshan Road. Mr. Jiang said the following:

Besides muscle relaxation and proper application, the most important things in Western boxing are punch power and the agility of dodging. British and American people are good at punch power, while Chinese boxers are good at dodging. When I box with foreigners, I often win, which is an important reason for this. Therefore, it is not difficult for Chinese people to learn Western boxing. With a little hard work, they can easily defeat British and American boxers.

After arriving in Shanghai, various Chinese and foreign professionals have asked me to participate, saying that I can earn more than two million yuan per match, but I am preparing to participate in the 1948 Olympic Games, so I cannot sacrifice my life's future for this small amount of income.

I am still practicing hard every day. Because I have no opponent, I have to imagine an enemy and fight ten rounds. This is certainly very frustrating, but I cannot give up now! I would like to organize an amateur championship before New Year's Day. Various Chinese and foreign amateur boxing friends have agreed to sponsor it, and I hope that it can become a reality. However, the venue problem has not yet been solved. I have discussed it with the Municipal Gymnasium, but they want to charge 40% of the income as rent, which is a very large expense.

After the interview, the reporter left, thinking silently on the way back: Domestic facilities, nutrition, physical strength, and the atmosphere of Western boxing are far inferior to those in other countries. We should place great hope on this very promising boxer, hoping that China can also show its strength in one event at the 1948 Olympic Games.

Civil Affairs Briefs

### Delineation Issue Between Suzhou and Shanghai: Internal Provincial and Municipal Government Officials Conduct Joint Survey; People Line Up to Welcome and Wish to Be Governed by the Municipality

The issue of the boundary delineation between this municipality and Jiangsu Province has been pending for twenty years without resolution. In order to expedite the delineation for better management, the Ministry of Interior sent Inspector Cheng to come to Shanghai to conduct a joint survey. The Municipal Government sent Li Xuexun, Zhou Qizhong of the Civil Affairs Department, Xu Hongkui of the Land Administration Bureau, Zhang, Wu Ruzhi of the Public Works Bureau, Zhong Yaohua and Li Zhigang of the Urban Planning Committee, etc. The Jiangsu Provincial Government sent Hui Jin and Gong Jin, two officials, to conduct a joint survey of the delineation sites.

On the first of this month, they first went to Qisai Town. Upon arrival, more than a thousand representatives petitioning for the delineation had already gathered at the station to welcome them, unanimously chanting slogans expressing their wish to be governed by the municipality. After disembarking, Inspector Cheng met with the petitioning representatives to solicit their opinions and, together with the Baoshan County government, conducted an on-site inspection. The next day, they went to Minhang, where the Shanghai County government convened local gentry and the heads of the County Party Department and the County Council in the reception room to hold a discussion and exchange opinions. On the 3rd, they conducted a joint survey of Zhuanqiao Town. Upon arrival, they, together with County Magistrate Xu and Secretary Li of Jiading, inspected the Juejie area, and Inspector Cheng met with the petitioning representatives to solicit their opinions. Most representatives advocated for incorporation into the municipal area for the convenience of promoting autonomous construction and governance. On the morning of the 4th, they traveled by car to Xingzhuang and, after talking with the County Magistrate of Songjiang and the Chief of the Urban Police Station, Inspector Cheng gave a speech to more than a thousand representatives present and solicited the opinions of the petitioning representatives. All representatives insisted on being incorporated into the municipal government. In the afternoon, they surveyed the Huazhuang and Wengbanqiao areas. On the 5th, they surveyed Sanlin. County Magistrate Ni, Secretary Xie, and District Chief Xue accompanied them to inspect the area around Sanlin. Inspector Cheng also met with more than a hundred representatives of the people. The general opinions of the people were the same as in Minhang. On the 6th, they surveyed Dachang, listening to the opinions of the people. Gentry Wang Yingyou, business representative Yao Yiqun, school representative Chen Qingqi, people's representative Chen Fuxin, and more than two thousand people, including civilians and students, gathered in the square of the 24th District Public Office, unanimously demanding to be under the jurisdiction of Shanghai and opposing the Baoshan County government. Inspector Cheng then addressed all the civilians and students and met with representatives from all walks of life to inquire in great detail. Inspector Cheng then stated that he would be responsible for reporting the opinions of the people in the Dachang District to the Ministry of Interior and the Executive Yuan and wait for a reasonable resolution.

### District Briefs

The 32nd District (Zhenru) has completed the copying of household registration, the original and duplicate copies, and six types of population statistics. The statistical tables were sent to the Civil Affairs Department on the morning of the 9th of this month.

The Mediation Committee of the 6th District (Loujiawan) has been organized in accordance with the instructions of the Municipal Government and has received many requests for mediation from district residents. A preparatory meeting was held in the conference room of the District Public Office at 2:00 PM on the 5th of this month.

The "Taishan District News," published by the Taishan District News Agency at 145 Taicang Road in this city, has rich content and is well-printed. It is particularly well-informed about all civil affairs news in the 5th District. Since its publication, the circulation has been very large.

The 26th District (Caohong) Public Office held the second household administration symposium at 10:00 AM on the 6th of this month. Also, Lou Zhenyu, the full-time officer of the 9th Bao in the district, resigned. The vacancy was filled by Pan Songling, who was appointed by the district. Ye Qing, the full-time officer of the 15th Bao, resigned due to illness. The vacancy was filled by Fang Qide, who was appointed by the district.

When shrapnel flew everywhere in the Jiangwan Arsenal explosion the other day, the 21st District (Xinshi) Public Office urgently ordered the officers of the 7th, 8th, and 12th Bao in the district, which were close to the explosion area, to cooperate with the military police and the chiefs of each Bao to maintain order within the Bao, and the situation was quite good.

### The Northwest Corner of Jiangxi

— A Naval Message Dated on the 2nd. Our Nanchang Reporter Liu Zao

Wu Ning is the hometown of the late Army General Li Xiehe. His ancestral home is in Shazixiang of the county. The General's coffin was transported from Chongqing to Jiangxi this spring and buried next to Xiehe Middle School in Shaxi Town, as he had instructed.

The General's revolutionary achievements are eternally remembered. The grand memorial services held in Xunyang and Gan, at which the General was mourned, reflected the respect of the people of Jiangxi for him. During this trip to northwestern Jiangxi, the reporter had a grand aspiration—to pay respects at the General's tomb to show his admiration. However, the day the reporter arrived at Shaxi was a clear day when the autumn colors were setting in the west. After just unloading the luggage, the reporter followed the directions of the locals and headed towards a small hill next to Xiehe Middle School. After searching the hilltop, the reporter only saw a mound of sand with a small bamboo sign in front of it that read, "Pedestrians Please Stop." At first, the reporter did not think that this was the General's tomb. Upon further inquiry, the locals informed the reporter that Li Xiehe, a figure with great feats, was lying right here.

The county seat is forty li from Shaxi. After a day's journey, going west from Shaxi, the population is denser, and the area is peaceful. However, the locals' lives are still a tough struggle, as seen by their pale faces and clothes that are patched and patched again, and by the "mourning color" mark worn: self-made shoes, white cloth on top [of the head].

### Wu Ning as a Cultural Center

The political and cultural center of the Xiushui River valley and the Jiurui area is in Wu Ning because it is the location of the Ninth Administrative Commissioner's Office of Jiangxi Province. Kang Jinglian, who was involved in the Fengxin embezzlement of silver case, was the Fourth District Commissioner during the war. The current commissioner, Wu Xibai, is a forthright and poetry-loving person. Under the current economic and transportation difficulties, managing the politics and livelihood of this area is not an easy task. For example, the province ordered the repair of the county road from Xiushui through Wuning to Yongxiu, which is 300 li long. The province issued only an order and no funds for subsidies, and required the road to be opened to traffic by the end of this year.

He said, "If we cannot complete the task of opening to traffic by the deadline, we will be punished. But we cannot allocate funds or collect materials. Where does the money come from, and where do the materials come from? It is killing the commissioner and worrying the county magistrate! It is difficult to be an official today!"

Looking at the streets, Wuning has gradually recovered after the robbery. Especially in terms of education, it is indeed better than other counties. Shaxi has the provincial Xiehe Middle School, and the county seat has the county middle school and Zhenfeng Middle School. The students' standards and teachers are not bad. Some schools are willing to pay "black market subsidies" to hire better specialized teachers, which is enough to show the hard work of those responsible for education there.

However, the local gentry's power is quite strong. For example, the Li family in Guayuan Township currently has 6,000 mu of good land and more than a thousand fir-covered mountains. One family handles all the township's affairs. Also, the township areas bordering Hubei Province, because they are beyond the reach of the law, dominate one side. The county magistrate can only sigh helplessly.

(Above) The countryside in northwestern Jiangxi is desolate. (Below) The county government building built by the Japanese army during their occupation of Anyi is the only complete government building in northwestern Jiangxi. (Photos by our reporter Liu Zao)

### De'an After the Robbery: Only Five and a Half Houses Left

After the robbery, De'an only had five and a half houses and 37,515 people who survived by the skin of their teeth. The desolation of the county seat is no less than that of Yongxiu. The sharp decline in the local population is terrifying, based on not very reliable statistics—before the Republic of China, the county's population was 130,000. In the first year of the Republic, it was 90,000. Before the war, it was 70,000. Now, it is only 37,515. Of the current population, some are from Henan and Hubei, most of whom came in the third year of the Republic due to famine in Henan and in the 19th year due to disaster. There are probably fewer than 20,000 real natives. It is said that the mortality rate in De'an has been very terrible in recent decades. In the past, farm families with more than ten people were very common, but now even a family of five is rare. Even the immigrants from Henan and Hubei are no exception.

### Funerals Without Coffins; County Government Serves as Temporary Residence

The funeral held by the Zheng family in the county seat recently can be considered unprecedented in De'an. The guests who came to mourn included dignitaries from Beijing-Hankou-Nanchang, as well as relatives and friends from the village. Military vehicles, jeeps, Western-suited dignitaries, and modern ladies made the dilapidated city of De'an look like a modern Chinese city, with everything it should have. Of course, it was a grand funeral. In the "long snake formation" of the funeral procession, there were no coffins, because Zheng's ancestors had died of illness in other counties many years ago while fleeing the disaster and had already been buried. Zheng's mother's coffin was recently transported from Chongqing and was still on its way.

However, the Zheng family's funeral was a hardship for the county magistrate. Although visiting dignitaries could eat cigarettes of the third and fifth brands and sit in cars that moved slowly like turtles to escort the funeral, the "couch" for the night became a problem. The county government had to be temporarily used as a residence. The county magistrate, who suffered every day, had to welcome and entertain these visiting dignitaries. Precisely in this lively and festive occasion, the Jiangxi Provincial Government Inspection Group arrived and also had no hotel to stay in, so they borrowed the county government and strictly refused any entertainment, making the county magistrate in a dilemma. He had no choice but to put on a show of "one scene, two styles" and let the guests who stayed together not disclose the truth to each other.

Shenyang's First Snow

### Stones and Soil Are Valuable Specialty Products in Xingzi County

Xingzi is a mountainous and lacustrine area. The county seat leans against Mount Lu in the back and Lake Poyang in the front. Therefore, mountains account for four-tenths of the county's land area, and water accounts for 3.3 tenths. Cultivatable land accounts for only three-tenths. With the current population of 67,764 people, the limited land—680,000 mu—is not enough to be self-sufficient with the annual crops. Even the bumper harvest this year is estimated to be two months short of enough food. Moreover, the farmland water conservancy in Qiduwei in the northern part of the county and Liaohuachi has been in disrepair for many years, which has a significant impact on cultivation. As for Liaohuachi, the water from Dianshan Pass, Hualin Mountain, Huanglong Mountain, and Yayaoshan, ninety-nine of them, converge in this low-lying area—Liaohuachi. About 4,000 mu of farmland is flooded, and more than 10,000 mu of good farmland nearby are affected. The area of the pond reaches 50 li, with 87 villages and more than 2,100 households. It was once started to be dredged in the Yongzheng period, but the project was too large and has not been completed. The dikes in Qiduwei are also collapsing in the east and west. If the water level of Poyang Lake rises sharply and the waterway is blocked, then the water from Lianhua, Qidu, and other places will only cause disasters in every pass. Now, the people of the county unanimously demand that the government provide them with financial and technical assistance. If this water conservancy project is dredged and repaired, Xingzi's food problem will not be difficult to solve.

Jinxing Song inkstones and precious porcelain clay are all specialty products of Xingzi. People who visit Xingzi are even more interested in Song inkstones and buy them as souvenirs of their visit to Mount Lu or give them as gifts to friends. However, now, due to the high labor costs, an ordinary Song inkstone costs nearly 10,000 yuan. Although bright golden light appears in the shiny stone pool, the buyers feel that the price is too high, so sales are sluggish and production is low.

The porcelain of Jingdezhen is precious because the porcelain clay of Xingzi is precious. If a thin and bright porcelain is to be made, it cannot be made without Xingzi clay. In recent years, because of the decline of Jingdezhen porcelain, Xingzi clay has naturally collapsed along with it.

Now, Xingzi's famous products—Song inkstones and porcelain clay—are declining.

### An Eyewitness Account of the Shenzhen Bloodshed: On the "Freedom of Action" of British Troops

— Wangri Kowloon Dispatch, Special Correspondent Cheng Zhang of This Newspaper

The news that a villager in Shenzhen was shot dead by British troops at 1:20 PM on the 3rd, within the Chinese territory of Wenjindu on the Sino-British border, spread. The next day, this reporter rushed from Guangzhou to Shenzhen. The case of Hong Kong hawker Wang Shuixiang being kicked to death by Portuguese police had not yet been resolved, and this unfortunate incident occurred at the Shenzhen border. In the past one or two months, British representatives of the people and prominent figures in industry and commerce have not hesitated to come to China from Europe, tirelessly conveying Britain's goodwill towards the Chinese nation, using giant special planes to fly back and forth in our major cities, drinking countless glasses of champagne, and repeatedly making speeches about Sino-British amity. If the facts show that this so-called goodwill and amity consist of fierce kicks from heavy boots and .303 caliber bullets, then the degree of our humiliation is far more than just "popular indignation"!

An Old Man Appeals for Justice

When this reporter arrived at the scene of the incident, the innocent victim was still lying on the roadside, guarded by our Chinese police officers with guns. The deceased was wearing a black velvet Zhongshan suit, his face was swollen, and a bullet had passed through the side of his right ear, his face a bloody mess, a gruesome sight. When this reporter was taking photos of the deceased, a decrepit old woman (the deceased's mother) ran over crying, asking us to seek justice for him, hitting her chest in grief, which was heartbreaking. The deceased was a kind commoner of the highest order who made a living as a "water carrier" (smuggler). In addition to his elderly mother, he also had a younger brother and sister, a family of four, all dependent on his two hands for support. But he was shot and killed by the British soldiers for no reason!

After thorough investigation and stern protests by our police and diplomatic personnel, at 7 PM on the 4th, the British Army Headquarters in Hong Kong issued a statement expressing regret and accepting full responsibility. (Editor's note: Please see yesterday's edition of this newspaper)

We Chinese people usually pride ourselves on being able to write "officialese," but after reading the British statement, we find that the British are also very skilled at writing. However, can flowery words and sophistry conceal ironclad facts?

A Gunshot Rang Out and He Fell to the Ground

The Sino-British border in Shenzhen is demarcated by the Shenzhen River. Wenjindu, the location of the incident, is the last stop on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway connecting to British territory. Taking a car from Kowloon in British territory, once you cross this, you enter the national border. Our side has set up a customs office about 100 meters from the riverbank. Many merchants (commonly known as "water carriers") pass back and forth every day. The British side has a small barracks on the other side of the riverbank. The British soldier who shot and killed the innocent Chinese commoner Zhang Tianxiang was stationed in that barracks. From where Zhang Tianxiang fell to the ground, this reporter looked across the river and saw a British military vehicle with a machine gun set up. Traffic on the bridge was normal, but there were few pedestrians, as if some of the somber atmosphere of yesterday still lingered. A customs officer who witnessed the tragedy told this reporter the following account:

"The tragedy occurred because of a young child. At the time, the girl was carrying a large bag of flour, which was intercepted by British soldiers when crossing the bridge from British territory. For some reason, the British soldiers beat the child severely. The child's cries attracted the villagers on the opposite bank. The British soldiers then followed the child into Chinese territory, and the villagers began to clamor. He (the customs officer) stepped forward to mediate, but the British soldier (later identified as Mike Robert, a junior lieutenant) forcefully said, "Within 100 feet of the border, I have complete freedom of action." Then, he reluctantly retreated. He returned to the customs office and suddenly heard a gunshot. The deceased fell to the ground. At the time, the villagers were emotionally agitated. Lin Wannian, the head of the Shenzhen Police Station, and Lu Shen, the transport commander of the military police, rushed to negotiate with the British troops. Yuan Zhichao, the head of the Shenzhen market town, did his best to persuade the villagers to maintain order, so the unfortunate incident did not escalate..."

Crossing the Border to Kill: A Hideous Face

This reporter found a representative from the Support Association in Wenjindu who was sent to Hong Kong to report. According to the Hong Kong newspapers, the representative reported the tragedy as follows: "Yesterday at 1:20 PM, a British soldier guarding the border in Wenjindu, Shenzhen, Bao'an County, Guangdong Province, crossed the border to chase two Chinese children, aged about thirteen or fourteen, carrying two small bags of white sugar and beat them. When the Shenzhen police saw this, they tried to dissuade him, which aroused the crowd of villagers watching. The British soldier retreated to British territory, and then led several British soldiers to the Wenjindu bridge spanning the two territories. They fired at the clamoring villagers, killing Zhang Tianxiang, a villager from the ninth Bao in Shenzhen. The crowd became even more indignant. Lu Shen, the transport commander of the Seventh Transport Company of the stationed Shenzhen military police, and Lin Wannian, the head of the Shenzhen Police Station, arrived at the scene after hearing the news and inquired about the truth. They then went to negotiate with the British guards in Wenjindu, but without result. The villagers, realizing the seriousness of the case, organized a Support Association that afternoon. On one hand, they asked the military police to guard Zhang's remains pending inspection, and on the other hand, they sent Wen Xuhua, the secretary of the county council, and Zheng Qichang, the section chief, to Hong Kong that evening to report the tragedy to the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Guangdong and Guangxi, requesting them to negotiate with the British side."

Combining this report with the above interview with the customs officer, we can understand the course of the tragedy. A hideous face of the British troops in Hong Kong, "crossing the border to shoot and kill," flashes before our eyes. Is this a manifestation of Sino-British cooperation? We want to ask Prime Minister Attlee and appeal to people of the world who uphold justice and freedom.

When this reporter left Shenzhen, I could not forget the victim Zhang Tianxiang, who was shot and killed and left lying on the road, and even more, I could not forget his grief-stricken old mother and those righteously indignant people!

### War Clouds Looming: The Overall Situation in Shandong

— Jinan Dispatch, May 5, Special Correspondent He Bingru of This Newspaper

Before the issuance of the order to cease conflict reached Shandong, after the Jiaoji Railway was cleared by the National Army, the cities and counties controlled by the government included Jinan City, Licheng, Qihe, Changqing, Ziyang, Liaocheng, Yuncheng, Changle, Anqiu, Jimo, Jiaoxian, Yidu, Linzi, Zichuan, Boshan, Changshan, Zouping, Zhangqiu, Changyi, Gaomi, Caoxian, Shanxian, Yutai, Chengwu, Dingtao, Jiaxiang, Juye, Heze, Jining, Yixian, Jinxiang, Dancheng, Ningyang, Pingdu, and Yexian, a total of thirty-five. A scene of improvement was once revealed. Since then, until recently, the situation in Shandong has turned into a looming war cloud.

This situation was caused by two prominent factors: (1) After the order to cease conflict reached Shandong, Wang Yaowu, the commander of the Second Pacification Zone, immediately ordered the National Army and security forces in Shandong to comply with the order, hold their original defenses, and stop advancing. This has been implemented until now, and the slogan "Rather be beaten than disobey orders" has been silently recited in the hearts of the soldiers. However, people have blood and spirit, and when pushed too hard, they will always fight back. Therefore, although there have been no major battles in Shandong recently, small clashes are still inevitable. (2) The Communist Army, in such a favorable opportunity, has indeed been able to obtain troop replenishment and fully deploy its independent activities on the battlefield.

Based on the information obtained by the government here, the movements of the Communist Army in Shandong indeed show signs of an active major battle. Communist Army General He Long led his troops from Shanxi through Cangxian to Dezhou in northern Shandong and convened a meeting of military and political personnel from the First Military Subdistrict of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, deciding to implement extensive conscription of soldiers and grain in his area, organizing stretcher, transport, and dare-to-die teams, attempting to clear the Jinpu Railway. Liu Bocheng's First, Third, and Yang Yong's Seventh Columns, nearly 50,000 men, plus local militia teams, totaling about 100,000, have begun to operate in southwestern Shandong and have already captured Juancheng and surrounded Dancheng. Communist Army footprints have also been found in the suburbs of Jinxiang County. Their purpose is to block the National Army from going north to support the southbound Communist Army. Chen Yi, the commander of the New Fourth Army, has been in Gaomi, repeatedly consulting with the heads of military and political affairs in the central, eastern, and coastal areas of Shandong to plan two offensives along the Jiaoji Railway in southeastern Shandong. Recently, new forces have been added, including the First, Second, and Third Armies of the "Liberation Alliance Army," which have entered Yishui from the mountainous areas of southwestern Shandong, preparing to participate in the Jiaodong campaign. Their original Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Ninth Liberation Divisions, and the Third and Fifth Police Brigades, are scattered in the outer areas of the National Army in Jiaoxian, Gaomi, Zichuan, Boshan, and Yexian. Their Seventh Liberation Division, after capturing Qidong, is still operating in the area north of the Xiaoching River. As for the coastal ports of Binzhou and Yantai in Shandong Province, there is a constant flow of Communist Army troop and ammunition replenishment ships. Under the current circumstances in Shandong, the National Army is indeed trapped in a Communist Army encirclement and feels restricted.

Recently, the Communist Army is preparing to divide the southeastern half of Shandong into three military centers, taking Gaomi in Jiaodong as the center, attempting to cut off the Jiaoji Railway and restore its transportation corridor. In the central Shandong area, they will take Zichuan and Boshan as the center, with the aim of capturing the Zibo mining area and connecting it with its base area in the mountainous region of southern Shandong. In addition, they will concentrate their forces, seizing opportunities to compete with the National Army for Jinan, in order to shake the government's military and political center of gravity in Shandong. On the 4th of this month, another Communist Army unit of over 10,000 men moved from Laiwu to Xiying, on the border of Tai'an and Licheng, only 50 li away from Jinan City. The purpose is still to be proved by facts, but it cannot be denied that Jinan is feeling threatened.

Currently, the entire situation in Shandong has reached a stage of imminent war, with fierce battles seemingly likely to break out anytime, anywhere. However, one side is complying with the ceasefire order and cannot launch an offensive, while the other side has suffered repeated blows and its overall strength is insufficient, and is still waiting for something. As for the National and Communist Armies, they both seem to focus on the Jiaoji Railway line in eastern Shandong. The current situation of the National Army is to ensure the Jiaoji Railway's transportation is advantageous. But if the National Army can always maintain this advantageous condition, then the Communist Army will never have a corridor, and its connection with the Northeast, all the way to northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong, in terms of land and sea transportation, will feel ineffective. This is the focus that both sides will desperately fight for in the future. If the overall situation of the country can be resolved in the future, the looming war clouds can gradually dissipate.

### The Desolate Baoshan

— 3rd Dispatch, Zhongying

Saishan City is so desolate that there is hardly any commerce. The so-called most vibrant West Gate Street has very few people walking during the day, and it is as cold and desolate as death at night. We walked alone on the street and only saw a few small restaurants and tobacco shops with their doors half-closed. People who want to buy clothing, stationery, and daily necessities must travel far to the countryside to buy them, because the market towns in the countryside are much more lively than the city. Isn't this a strange phenomenon? Baoshan has no entertainment venues, only a small teahouse with a dozen or so people listening to the storytelling of Shuangzhufeng. This is Baoshan's only entertainment venue. As for movies, Peking Opera, and plays, they would never even dream of them. The most difficult thing in Baoshan is that if you get sick, you can't find a doctor. Although the county government runs a health hospital, it has no funds, so there are no medicines. Therefore, you have to go to another place for treatment, or you will just die of illness. Don't you think this is a very difficult thing?

Education is in Decline, but the County Government is Honest

Education in Baoshan was originally very developed, but it has been affected by the past wars. Moreover, due to the current financial difficulties of the county government, teachers' salaries have not been paid for several months, so education has suddenly become bankrupt.

Baoshan has five districts: Chengxiang, Yuepu, Luodian, Liuhang, and Dachang. The total population of the county is over 135,000, and the population of Baoshan County is around 3,000. County Magistrate Cheng Daomin is very honest and upright, and is deeply loved and trusted by the general public. County Magistrate Cheng is very frugal. His daily allowance for food, morning, noon, and evening meals, is only 300 yuan. Indeed, he shares joys and hardships with his subordinates. He is diligent and loves the people, which is rare in today's society where corruption is rampant.

### The Education and Care of Children with Learning Disabilities

— Yu Renfeng

Modern education has shifted from a general approach to an individualized one. Because of the different levels of children's knowledge and the differences in their personalities, there are distinctions between gifted, normal, and children with learning disabilities. Generally speaking, normal children account for the largest number, while gifted and children with learning disabilities are relatively few. Throughout history, humankind seems to have only focused on cultivating children with outstanding talents while neglecting children with learning disabilities. This is their misfortune, and it is also a flaw in humanity. Therefore, we should also teach according to their abilities, so that they can develop their intelligence and adapt to life as much as possible.

In general, parents use the same methods to educate and care for all their children. But for children with learning disabilities, they even abandon their responsibility to educate them. Especially because of the underdeveloped education in our country and the lack of special facilities, children with learning disabilities have suffered misfortune. Their existence is only pain and a burden. In view of this, the author would like to offer a few suggestions to modern parents who have children with learning disabilities.

(1) What is a Learning Disability?

There are various definitions and explanations of learning disabilities. Some scholars believe that it is a difference in quality, that is, low intelligence; another says it is a difference in quantity, in other words, a learning disability is not a lack of intelligence, but simply a difference in the amount of knowledge and ability. However, we are not going to discuss the principles. We can get a more precise answer from both physiological and psychological perspectives.

(1) Physiological reasons: A learning disability is a serious and permanent neurological defect due to the underdevelopment of nerve tissue.

(2) Psychological reasons: A learning disability is the underdevelopment or defect of the mind, which occurs before or after birth and affects intellectual judgment and understanding. This defect is difficult to cure.

(3) "Eugenics" explanation: It is inherited from the improper reproduction of the nation.

After looking at the above answers, we may confuse "learning disability" with "dullness." Therefore, it must be noted here that any slow progress or temporary mental defect is not a learning disability, because it is temporary and can be restored to normal with proper guidance and treatment.

(2) Special Education for Children with Learning Disabilities

(1) Focus on physical and skill training: Although children with learning disabilities can also read and calculate, it is very limited. Except for children with self-inflicted injuries and children with learning disabilities with incurable major defects, we should focus on training them in life skills. Therefore, physical training and ability-based education should take up most of the time. Simple and crude activities such as walking, running, jumping, sweeping, washing, hammering nails, and making simple chairs and tables are most suitable. Because they have psychological defects, most of them do not like to move. We can encourage them to play games to arouse their interest in activity, because this is of great importance in training and teaching.

(2) Intellectual education should be gradual: As I said above, children with learning disabilities lack general intelligence. They are very weak in terms of comprehension, judgment, and learning ability. Therefore, we must hone their thinking ability and muscle movements. Various building block toys are good teaching tools that they can play with. On the one hand, use physical activities to allow them to grow and be active appropriately. However, no matter what educational methods are used, they must always be lower than the capabilities of all normal children, and they should be taught patiently. Appropriate learning steps are a condition for success in education. It is bound to fail if children with learning disabilities are asked to do complex problems beyond their comprehension.

(3) Repetition of stimuli: Children with learning disabilities often do not have a complete response. Due to the relatively slow action of the nervous system, they are difficult to cope with if the stimuli are too fast. Therefore, let them repeatedly practice a response in the same environment so that it becomes a habit. When faced with the same situation, they will react very familiarly. After one stimulus is successful, give a new one, which is effective.

(4) Give Sympathy and Pleasure: It is a common feature of animals to choose and learn the reactions that produce pleasure; conversely, they eliminate and discard the reactions that produce unpleasantness. This principle should be used more appropriately for children with learning disabilities. Do not dislike them because of trouble and impatience. We should think of their plight and give them more sympathy, so that they will not be further suppressed in their hearts.

(5) Designing the Application of Education: In games and daily life environments, guide them to learn many useful skills. That kind of efficiency can never be achieved through books. For example, children like to organize families. We can use that opportunity to let them perform their duties in the family and teach them various knowledge that they should have. The design education method takes the child's interests as the discussion goal, but it should also expand the scope as much as possible, so that children with learning disabilities can achieve greater results in intensive training.

(6) Proper Guidance of Instinct: The instincts and emotions of children with learning disabilities are not defective due to lack of intelligence. Ordinary children with learning disabilities have the instincts that ordinary children should have. However, we should pay attention to the lack of self-control in children with learning disabilities—strong instinctual emotions and weak intellect. Therefore, moral education is even more important for children with learning disabilities. We should make them know the difference between good and evil. Instinctive impulses should have proper expression and handling, especially sexual instincts. According to Gulik's investigation, children with learning disabilities have strong heterosexual instincts, but due to their lack of rational restraint, many adult individuals with learning disabilities commit illegitimate births, illegal unions, or other illegal sexual acts. Therefore, sexual hygiene and morality should be made known to them. Pay attention to any immoral behavior that occurs. The obedience instinct of children with learning disabilities is obvious. They are easily exploited and seduced, easily commanded, and easily deceived. The most appropriate way to avoid this is to isolate them from bad environments to avoid external seduction, in addition to giving them moral and ethical concepts. If you don't pay attention to it early on, it will be difficult to change the habit once it is formed.

(7) On Rewards and Punishments for Children with Learning Disabilities: Since children with learning disabilities do not understand the natural cause and effect of good and evil and suffering and pleasure, we should cultivate good habits in them. On the one hand, after good and evil behaviors are expressed, give them appropriate rewards and punishments, so that the rewards for good and punishments for evil are inextricably linked. Our rewards and punishments for children with learning disabilities cannot be based on normal children. Some normal children do not even know the difference between good and evil behaviors, let alone children with learning disabilities. It is like a lame person cannot be blamed for staggering, they should be specially trained and forgiven. As for the methods of rewards and punishments, concrete things should be used, methods that are obvious and have immediate consequences. Using toys and candies as prizes, not allowing them to play with a certain utensil, not allowing them to eat a certain kind of candy, and not allowing them to play with their companions are all good methods of rewards and punishments. Our attitude should be gentle, but not too indulgent. However, I always oppose physical punishment, and it should not be used on children with learning disabilities, because we are calling on them to repent, not calling on them not to do it because of fear. The effect I want is permanent, not temporary.

### Gambling Harms Shanghai Women

— Duyun

When I was young in the Ningbo countryside, I never saw women sitting and playing cards, because at that time, people generally regarded women playing cards as vulgar. But I never thought that in today's Shanghai, women generally regard playing cards as a daily routine and are not ashamed of it. In fact, it really harms Shanghai women.

1. Neglecting Household Chores: In order to play cards, women cook hastily, do not repair their clothes, and do not even sweep the floor or make the bed, letting the furnishings be messy and do not care.

2. Treating Guests Rudely: When guests come to visit or negotiate business, the hostess is playing cards, and no tea or water is offered. She just sits there, turning her back to the guests, making the guests feel bored and leave.

3. Indulging Children: When the mother plays cards, the children think their chance has come. Asking for money is especially easy, developing wasteful habits, buying things to eat randomly, not counting hygiene; wandering outdoors, neglecting their studies, if left to the maid, they will not receive proper training.

4. Family Discord: Gamblers take money lightly and often blame their husbands for earning too little. They are enthusiastic about gambling and treat their husbands with cold affection. Because the family life is disorderly, it causes the husband to be critical. Over time, cases of deteriorating situations are not uncommon!

5. Damage to Health: Women who are enthusiastic about playing cards, some with disheveled hair and dirty faces, do not repair their appearance, do not wear clothes in time for cold and warm weather; they do not eat when hungry, forming stomach problems; in addition, the current card games are varied, requiring a lot of brainpower and excessive thinking, causing insomnia, becoming increasingly old, and even shortening their lifespan, which is not an exaggeration.

### Miscellaneous Household Records

— Qingxi

For wooden utensils stained with oil, washing them with tea leaves is very effective.

Putting a little bit of firewood ash in a vase can make the flowers last longer.

White clothes should be dried in the sun, not in the shade, otherwise they will turn yellow and cannot be washed white again next time.

When washing velvet, add a little ammonia water to the water, and the dirt will immediately be removed, which has the effect of restoring the old to new.

### For Young Ladies

— Meng Jin

One knows everyone under the sun, yet has not even one or two confidants. Making friends is already not an easy matter, how much more so when choosing a spouse? Especially for women, once married, they must take on the responsibility of educating and raising children, dedicating their energy to the family. A man can marry a wife without ability, but if a woman marries a husband without ability, she will have to starve with him. However, it doesn't matter much if a man marries ten years later, but if a woman gets a little older, she'll feel anxious. In other words, the period for a woman to choose a spouse is shorter. Women mostly like young, handsome men with status, but such men are hard to find in the world. A young man can't have status, and a man with status is often already gray at the temples and probably has children already. As for young, handsome playboys, they show their special status by relying on their fathers and brothers' blessings, but these types are mostly without promise and not ideal husbands. Precisely because of this, many women often miss their youth because their conditions are too harsh.

Secondly, women who don't thoroughly understand love all like men who are considerate and meticulous during the pursuit period. In their eyes, as long as a man is gentle, love is guaranteed. Little do they know that a man is, after all, a man. A man who doesn't dare to get angry or fierce is either without promise or hypocritical. Every promising young man has his own self-esteem and ambition. He may sacrifice everything for his lover, but during the pursuit period, his expression is restrained and he easily knows when to stop. He doesn't easily pursue women, but if he is met with a cold shoulder after pursuing, he will immediately turn around. This type of man seems difficult to grasp, but once brought under control, his love is often pure and reliable. Conversely, those considerate and meticulous men are mostly skilled in love affairs and the least reliable. During the dating period, they are an ideal lover, but after marriage, they are husbands of divided loyalty. The difficulty for women in choosing a spouse lies in the fact that good men don't desperately pursue, and those who desperately pursue are mostly not good men. Everyone acknowledges that Washington and Lincoln were good men full of passion, but how many women in America at that time had the discerning eye to recognize heroes?

From a person's breadth of mind, you can see their entire personality and future. A person who only knows how to plan for themselves and only knows how to show off, the more sickening their sweet words, the more it reveals their insignificance. Young ladies! Please pay attention.

### How Sesame Cakes are Made

— Zhi

Cooking is something housewives should study. When your husband returns from the office, he is tired. If you can make a delicious snack or a hearty dinner, you will not only learn more cooking skills, but also make your husband forget his fatigue and enhance the love between husband and wife.

Now I will write down the "sesame cake" method below.

Ingredients – flour, oil, sugar, water, etc.

Method – Divided into three steps: flaky pastry, outer skin, and filling.

(1) Making flaky pastry – Place the flour in a bowl, melt the lard until it is watery, pour it into the flour bowl, mix it into a lump, knead it evenly, roll it into a long strip, cut it into small pieces, and then roll each piece into a round shape, like a longan.

(2) Making the outer skin – The method is the same as above. But mix two-thirds water with one-third oil, mix into a lump, also cut into small pieces, and roll into a round shape, the size of a longan.

(3) Making the filling – The method is the same, also using only oil to mix the flour, but add white sugar, knead, cut into pieces, and then roll into a round shape, the size of a longan.

Once all three types are made, combine them.

The method of combining is like making dumplings. First, knead the outer skin piece into a concave-convex shape, put the flaky pastry piece inside as a filling, wrap it up, and roll it into a round shape. Then, knead this round piece into a concave-convex shape again, put the filling piece inside as a filling, wrap it up, and roll it into a round shape. Then flatten it, but the periphery must still maintain a round color.

After making the cake dough in this way, it can be baked. Baking method: First heat the pot, spread a layer of oil on the surface of the pot, and then arrange the cake doughs one by one into the pot, turning them over several times, baking until they are yellow and cooked but not burnt, then you can shovel them up.

If, after the cake dough is made, you want to add some decoration, there are three convenient methods. You might as well try them.

(1) Use the teeth of a clean comb (the kind used for haircuts) to imprint diamond-shaped patterns or hexagonal patterns of dotted lines on the surface of the cake dough.

(2) Use large hemp seeds (like a chrysanthemum stamp) or sesame husks (her cross-section becomes a plum blossom stamp), dip them in some grease and water, and imprint scattered flower patterns on the surface.

(3) If you want to imprint raised patterns, you can use a yin-patterned mold, like stamping sugar cakes.

Attached are two baking methods:

(A) Roasted spare ribs (Cantonese call it "char siu") Specially take the muscle and tendon parts of the ribs with some fat, remove the ribs, stuff them with scallions, and bake them on charcoal. At the same time, use vinegar and soy sauce to frequently coat them, so that they are flavorful (those who don't like vinegar can omit it), and bake until the inside is thoroughly cooked and the surface is slightly charred.

(B) Roasted chicken and roasted duck: Submerge the tender chicken or tender duck that has been slaughtered and washed in soy sauce for half a day, take it out and let it air dry slightly, and roast it over charcoal. Turn it over from time to time, and do not let it burn. Frequently coat the skin with sesame oil, and roast until it is thoroughly cooked inside and out.

The above two are very easy for ordinary, capable housewives to do, and I hope readers will try it.

### Opera of Qing Dynasty Painters

— Zhen Zhi

Qing Dynasty painters who were also opera writers, according to records, include: Zhang Qu, Yan Baoyong, Wan Rong'en, Tang Yifen, Yao Meibo and others. There are many extant zaju and chuanqi plays written by them. Descriptions are given separately below:

Zhang Qu

Jiang Baoling's "Molin Jinhua" Volume 10, "Zhang Qingzhai's Painting Follows the Northern School" says:

"Zhang Qingzhai Qu, a native of Xiaoshan, became a student in his youth and once stayed in the capital. He was famous for writing both northern and southern tunes. The two chuanqi plays he wrote, "Furong Tower" and "Yujie Ji", have been published, and the Peking Opera troupes in the capital competed to perform them. His "Xinfang Lu" (which contains very detailed information about the Donglin party members), "Xianxian Tang Ji" and other books have not been published. He is still healthy at the age of eighty-odd this year. His painting follows the Northern School and is full of strangeness." According to Zhang's two chuanqi plays both exist, published by Xianfeng Koubozhai. Mr. Zheng Xidi has both, and the Peking Library and Wu Mei each have one copy of "Furong Tower". Yao Xie's "Jin Yue Kaozheng" records (ten) included. Jiao Xun's "Qu Kao" and Wang's "Qu Lu" attribute "Furong Tower" to Jian Shan's work, suspecting that it is a different book with the same name, because Jian Shan also has another play called "Yishui Ge", which was not written by Zhang.

Yan Baoyong

"Molin Jinhua" Volume 11, "Sketching Master's Acupuncture Needle for Music" records Yan's:

"Yan Danchang Baoyong, named Wenqiao, a native of Dantu, passed the Yimao provincial examination first. I first met him at the county government. He often had merry gatherings with Lord Weng Haicun, Gai Qixiang, Liao Peizhou, and Lin Zi'an. People sometimes joked about his being a "Relieved First Scholar", which he did not enjoy. Later, he entered the Hanlin Academy and was changed to county magistrate. He served in Qixia, Shandong for two years, earning a reputation for good governance. He returned home because of his mother's death and never went out again, showing his indifference to fame and wealth. He was determined to study hard, believing that his poems, ancient prose and lyrics were not as good as those of the ancients, but he felt no shame in writing chuanqi plays. His "Tongxin Yan", "Qihua Jian", "Honglou Xinqu" and other zaju plays were popular in the capital. Tang Taoshan Fangbo wrote a poem for him: "The child is also a well-known inferior scholar, and musicians compete to sing the poems in his books," which is a factual account. His paintings of orchids and bamboos have a refined charm, and he also dabbles in freehand flower paintings. He once cited Wu Meicun's seven characters "seems to be able to get the meaning of flowers" as acupuncture needles for sketching artists to live in the world, which connoisseurs approve of." According to Zhi Fengyi's "Qu Mu Biao" and "Jin Yue Kaozheng" (five), in addition to the above three types in the Qing Zaju section, there are two other types: "Tun Yue Bao" and "Shuangyan Ji". In addition, there are three types: "Wangfu Shi", "Gui Wei Feng", and "Yulan Meng", which still exist today.

Tang Yifen

"Molin Jinhua" Volume 15, "Painting Appraisal and Analysis" records Tang Yifen:

"General Tang Yusheng Yifen, styled Ruobi, later called himself Zhou Weng, was a native of Wujin. Because of his grandfather's difficulties, he inherited the title of Yunqi Lieutenant in his youth and became the Sanjiang Defender, serving successively in Guangdong, Shanxi and Zhejiang. He was refined and honest, and the bandits disappeared at the news of his arrival. Later, as the Central Military Counselor of the Pacifying Standard, he was promoted to the Deputy General of Wenzhou, but he did not go due to illness. He retired to Xiangmen and rented the garden of Zhou Jinshi Baoxu to live in, intending to end his days in seclusion. The General had an outstanding talent and could delve deeply into astronomy, geography, and the learning of the hundred schools. His calligraphy, painting, poetry and prose were all masterpieces. He loved drinking and was skilled at playing the qin." According to Tang, he died as a martyr when the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom captured Nanjing in the third year of Xianfeng. The "Huamei Lou Poems and Lyrics" in the same book also record:

"I heard that the General was deeply proficient in music and created "Tixian Ge Three Pieces", ordering the maids in his family to sing them, and they could all sing them fluently. This also has a special implication, and is not the Eastern Mountain silk and bamboo music that expresses the feelings of middle age." According to Tang, there is a zaju play called "Xiaoyao Jin", a manuscript of which is stored in the Peking Library, and Lu Qian once engraved it in "Yin Hongyi Congke". The play is divided into four acts: Xun Chun, Bu Meng, Na Fang, and Jin Meng, and it tells the story of Tang's trip to Weizhou and his friendship with the Weizhou Lieutenant Xu Zirong. It is his own narration and is of little value. "Jin Yue Kaozheng" records (ten) that there is also a chuanqi play called "Jian Ren Yuan", but no copies have been found. If these two are all within the "Tixian Ge Three Pieces", the remaining one is a zaju or chuanqi play with an unknown name.

Yao Xie

"Molin Jinhua" Volume 18, "Yao Xiaolian" says:

"Yao Yeqiao Xie of Zhenhai, styled Meibo, a Jiashen Juren. He was skilled at painting, excelled at ink plum blossoms, line drawing of figures, and freehand flower paintings, all of which were in the ancient style. In the spring of Gengzi, when you went north from Wumen, I, Jie Zhisheng, saw him off at Liangxi and traveled with him to Dengwei and Huishan before returning. On the boat, I wrote a "Xiangjiang You Si Tu" Langtaosha Ci for Zhisheng: "Poetry dreams hold orchid quilts, the water vapor is heavy; Mount Emei hangs small in the twilight, the light Tuo Xiang traces are clipped in autumn. People's words are smoky, when will the book paste be found? The vast shore is deep in the sky, and the goddess of the Luo River contains love and plays with secluded birds. Sing to the misty water and clouds song, the jade flute blows the qin." He has engraved "Shuying Lou Ci" in eight volumes. He is also good at music and has two chuanqi plays, "Tui Hong Shan" and "Mei Qin Xue", as well as "Ci Lu Kanwu" and several volumes of poetry and prose collections." According to Yao, he is known to the world for his book "Jin Yue Kaozheng". He compiled "Jin Yuefu Xuan" in five hundred volumes. The two chuanqi plays he wrote are not recorded in his own "Jin Yue Kaozheng". Ma Yuzao's postscript said that each play has eight volumes, but neither has a transmitted copy.

Wan Rong'en

Feng Jinbo (Yetang)'s "Yixiang Ju Hua Yi" Volume 10 records Wan Rong'en:

"Wan Rong'en, styled Yuqing, a Zhusheng from Jiangning. He can paint landscapes, birds and insects, all of which are excellent. He is also good at long lyrics and songs, and wrote the chuanqi play "Zhehua Lou". He is unrestrained and romantic, with the style of Liu Ru and Meng Jin." According to "Jin Yue Kaozheng" (ten): "Styled Xinqing Jushi", recorded "Xingshi Yuan", which still exists today, but "Zhehua Lou" has not been found.

Popular Tune Writer Zhao Ziyong

"Molin Jinhua" Volume 17 "Anecdotes of the Art World" records Zhao Ziyong:

"Zhao Ziyong Mingshan, a Nanhai Xiaolian, loves to paint bamboo, and has the same obsession as Yu Ke. He was the Magistrate of Xiang County, Shandong. He often painted bamboo at the end of official documents, with the style of Taoist Banqiao. Also, when he was in the local examination, he bought hundreds of fans, piled them on his desk, and painted on them all day long, giving a handful to each person, which is also an anecdote in the art world. Ziguang, styled Xiaoming, also paints bamboo and is good at painting crabs." According to Zhao, he is not an opera writer, but he is famous for writing the Cantonese folk song "Jie Xin". He is also a painter and musician. Rong Yuantaijun once wrote a small examination, discussing Zhao and his "Jie Xin", published in "Geyao Zhoukan".

### A Proof of the Westward Movement of Our Culture

— Lu

Since the Yining Incident, the government has attached great importance to defending the Northwest. This decision of the National Assembly also involves border issues. According to the author, the great Chinese nation is formed by the cultural fusion of many ethnic groups. As evidenced by history, the Han Chinese of today, their earliest ancestors also moved from the Northwest to the Southeast; and the origin is often more distant than today's Northwest frontier. In fact, Asian human civilization originated in Central Asia and Western Asia. Western scholars have repeatedly made discoveries. Following the traces of its development, one branch moved eastward, with some staying in today's Northwest, and some further extending eastward and southeastward to the Central Plains, gaining the help of superior natural conditions and promoting today's Han civilization.

Anyone with a little historical knowledge should know that the founding of China began with the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan. According to historical records, the title of Xuanyuan originated from the fact that the Emperor was born on the Hill of Xuanyuan, and therefore took it as his clan name. Xuan, compared to Hill, is noted to be in the territory of present-day Henan Province; the years are distant, and it is difficult to obtain strong corroborating evidence. The author believes that the interpretation of Xuanyuan is car-like, and the Yellow Emperor invented the compass, whose legacy is still an auxiliary tool for navigation today. In fact, the Yellow Emperor at that time led his clan to expand eastward, just like Columbus exploring the New World, relying on the compass, from the Northwest Plateau, folded along the mountains to the south and rushed to the Central Plains. Suddenly discovered a plain with fertile soil and a temperate climate, and could not help but cheer "Hua", Hua means beautiful, so the name of the Chinese nation was determined. The natives of the Central Plains, still untamed, suddenly saw a large number of eastern migrants descend, and could not name them, so they named them the Xuanyuan clan, just like today's naming of tank teams and armored vehicle teams.

The Yellow Emperor, with superior equipment, overcame the native leader Chi You, hung down clothes and made calendars, established officials and set music, and his wife Lei Zu, promoted the benefits of sericulture, laying the cornerstone of Chinese civilization.

Therefore, we people do not need to distinguish between Han and border people from Northwest compatriots at all, because ancestors and grandchildren have passed down through hundreds of generations, and they are of the same lineage, so it is impossible to separate and unnecessary to separate.

### Goethe's Quotations

— Wanshi

Conscientiousness means doing the current thing quickly and faithfully; in other words, it means doing what should be done today well.

We cannot do without great men, but great men are a great obstacle to the world.

Not everyone can be a hero, but everyone can be a "person."

The greatest benefit of reading history is to invigorate our spirit.

### Western Mirror

— Xia Dang

Xia Dang (Simeon Chardin 1699-1779) was a famous painter of the French Rococo era, as famous as Hua Zi, but with different styles. He abandoned the luxurious and leisurely worldliness of the time and specialized in studying the various dynamics of daily life that are eye-catching. As a subject matter, the style is more realistic. He made the most still lifes in his life, and also often made sketches. This "Western Mirror" is one of them. (Lion)

### Franz Schubert's Last Writing…

— Written by A. Walker Tax, Translated by Li Mengfei

This is a story about the last days of the young musician Franz Schubert (1797-1828), written with the utmost respect and affection. And strangely enough, it is also the story of his life—constantly playing his noble and eternal melodies in a romantic life of sorrow and distress.

One day in November 1828, Franz Schubert died of typhoid fever in his brother's house outside Vienna. Only a year before, when Beethoven closed his eyes and passed away, he held a torch and was one of the participants in the funeral procession. When they buried the saint of music in the flower garden, on the way back, they walked into a tavern, and it was Schubert who raised his glass to the crowd and toasted: "Who will be the successor to the saint of music Beethoven?" But the shadow of death soon fell on this unfortunate, miserable, fat, unkempt young man, his nearsighted eyes, his desolate mood, no longer had his charming, beautiful songs to offer to the world.

After that, who will bring us these gifts full of love, joyous praises, genuine feelings of natural expression, and fascinating melodies—only he, an inexhaustible source of music. However, in November 1828, after freezing his short life, it was no longer possible to hear even a trace of his voice. His exuberant talent for composition, when he was composing four-part harmonies, he needed an assistant to copy for him. Every time the sun sets and the nightingale sings, his Serenade may pale in comparison.

But when people light the lights, Schubert's Serenade is remembered again. This is one that will not be forgotten in his entire life. Yes, he will remember it forever. This immortal song was written to celebrate a girl's birthday. On that day, the author also had to attend in person to accompany the choir. In the twilight, the piano was moved to the garden, and the choir gathered under the window of the girl he loved, but Franz, he, he forgot to come.

Although he died at the age of only thirty-one, his works have exceeded a thousand. All his property on the list, according to the highest market price, was valued at eight shillings and six pence, including the original manuscripts of great works in the last year. In fact, Schubert's long-lost noble manuscripts were scattered throughout Vienna. A generation later, the young O'Shaughnessy and his friend Groh came from England by sea and anxiously opened a forgotten private room and found the missing parts of Rosamunds. After a long midnight, they excavated Schubert's treasure. When the golden mist rose, the transcription work was completed. Because they were young, they were passionately in love with Franz Schubert. They could not suppress their emotions and could only play hopscotch to express them until the cafe opened.

Schubert's prolificacy has often been ridiculed as the reason for his poverty and destitution. He could compose twelve songs in one day. He naively wanted to exchange his works for a rich price from a publisher. But the twenty-four songs that Schubert sold to him a month ago have not yet been printed!

So, what was Schubert's last writing? Yes, it was a letter, a letter written to his friend Schober. At the beginning of this year, the two of them lived together in the Blue Hedgehog, until the King of Songs could not even pay half the rent before moving out.

Dear Schober:

I am sick. I haven't eaten anything for twelve days. I feel very tired and shaken and can only support going back and forth from the bed to the chair. Lina is serving me. Even a little taste is still vomited out. In this distressing situation, reading is my most intimate help. I have finished reading Cooper's (Note) "The Last of the Mohicans," "The Spy," "The Pilot," and "The Pioneer." If you have Cooper's books, please hand them over to Mrs. Kogner in the coffee shop. My brother will bring them to me very carefully. Or other books are also fine.

Your friend Schubert November 11, 1828

If you think this letter is lovely, it may be because it was discovered many years later, his past misfortune, which everyone paid attention to with a tight heart, a message that is still of value today. The regret is that Chang Xupei was lying in bed, eagerly looking forward to Cooper's "The Deerslayer", but this book was not completed before Schubert's death in 1828. …

Although Schubert is lying in his peaceful cemetery, in this resting place full of musical atmosphere, the sparrows flying down will also be close to him, listening to the beating of his gentle heart.

Note: Cooper (James Frenimore Cooper) American novelist (1789-1851). Most of his novels are themed on American and Indian warfare.

### A Shard of Land, A Rain of Blood 118

— Ye Jingfeng

Although Tsurumi was quite shocked at this moment, he was fortunate to have anticipated this move, and had not lied. However, he still broke out in a cold sweat. On the spot, he could only flip through the report, while trying his best to suppress his tense emotions. The report clearly recorded his every move since he got off the plane, as well as what happened at the Black Dragon Society. Even the content of the several phone calls he made at the dance hall were recorded verbatim. It even mentioned how "Number Zero Twelve" brought people to the outside of the "New Green" dance hall and how they dealt with those who were tracking Tsurumi, and how they set an ambush here and sent Tsurumi's driver away.

As Tsurumi read on, the cold sweat on his body soaked his back. "How formidable!" he exclaimed to himself in astonishment. In just over ten minutes, he skimmed through the report. Then, he stealthily took out Pingzi's small note from a hidden place under his clothing and asked the concubine to hand it to Konoe. He also truthfully explained how he had replaced the note at the last minute due to his fear. Konoe heard this and burst into a strange laugh:

"Very good! Let me tell you, I don't care about your personal affairs. And let me tell you, although you don't know what Miss Nakamura wrote, I can tell you! It's quite ingenious, perhaps there's a hint of fate in it. According to you, what you wrote on the paper was just a random phrase you saw on the hanging screen in the guest room. However, what Ms. Pingzi wrote happened to be the same, with only one word different. You wrote: 'Spring flowers, autumn moon, casually pass the time, how much of the past, you know yourself.' Her first line is exactly the same as yours, but the second line is: 'How much of the past, I hope you know.'"

"However, this one-word difference is significant! Why does she hope you know her past? You don't know, but I do! Because she has admired you for several years... Haha, her feelings for you are very deep!... This is something to celebrate!" Konoe said, and ordered the concubine, "Serve wine."...

North of Fukushima, near the sea, there is a small place called Matsushima, which is not well-known, but the scenery is excellent. This place is five or six hours by train from Tokyo. Tsurumi suffered for several hours at Konoe's place. When he came out, it was already broad daylight. He saw his car parked neatly at the door, and driver Number Zero Eight, Inoshishi, was standing outside the car waiting for him. Tsurumi had gone through a night of torment and felt like every plant and tree was an enemy soldier. He didn't want to ask Inoshishi anything. He got into the car and only said the word "station," then curled up in the car. When he arrived at the station, he told Inoshishi to go back and bought a ticket to Fukushima and then Matsushima. He arrived at his destination at around 3 p.m.

Tsurumi couldn't rest on the train because the events of that night were beyond his imagination: Pingzi; the Fifth Column of the General Headquarters; Aoki; Konoe; and so on. The sudden appearance of these figures, the changes in the situation, were all beyond imagination. Looking back, it was like a dream. If his nerves weren't so strong, he would have thought he had really experienced all these strange things in a dream. These things happened one after another, too quickly to cope with.

Matsushima was a place he often visited as a child. Before going to mainland China, he would come here for a few days every so often. In the countryside of Matsushima, there is a village called Tamura, a very remote place with a small population and extremely beautiful scenery. It is backed by mountains and faces the ocean. In a mountain village in Japan, in a house near the mountains, lived an old lady in her late sixties, Mrs. Koyuan. She was a relative of Tsurumi's adoptive mother, Meizi. After Meizi married Tsurumi Kiyoshi, they remained close. Mrs. Koyuan was a widow with only one son and one daughter, so she treated Tsurumi like her own son, even more considerate than Meizi.

### Fire

— Shaofu

High winds are good for arson, and dark nights are good for murder. The weather is getting cold, and the northwest wind is strong. Arson is the work of robbers, but we are sleepy and afraid of the cold. If we are careless with fire, a single spark can start a prairie fire. It's too dangerous!

A few days ago, the arsenal in Jianghu exploded. It is said that the cause was a carelessly dropped hand grenade. However, the direct and indirect losses to both public and private entities are, frankly, incalculable. If it had happened in a bustling city, wouldn't it have been an unprecedented tragedy?

A tire shop owner's son turned one month old. Red candles were burning high, filling the air with joy. Unexpectedly, joy turned to sorrow. A spark from the candle touched gasoline, and in an instant, the entire shop was reduced to ashes, affecting the neighbors on both sides. Nothing is more unfortunate than this.

To prevent accidents, the head of the household should inspect the kitchen and stove areas every night before going to bed, carefully checking stoves, electric stoves, electric wiring, etc., to see if there is any damage. Flammable items should be stored safely. All of these things are minor and easily overlooked, but once disaster strikes, families can be ruined.

The end of the year is approaching. Although everyone has had a tense and uneasy year, we have managed to get through it. Who can withstand another unexpected disaster? I offer this as a reminder to everyone.

Fable

### If There is Only One Reproductive Male Left in the World

— Yezi

[Foreword] "Free Talk" published an "Fable" a month ago, saying that an atomic bomb exploded accidentally one day, destroying the reproductive capacity of all the men in the world. Fortunately, a male worker in a mine was spared. Therefore, how to deal with this unique and reproductive male in the world became a major international event...

I don't usually see that article as a "fable." I think it is a "futurist" tragedy. So, I turned over many books. As a result, I know that even if such a day comes, scientists will still have ways to remedy it. Within five years, women all over the world could be "impregnated" one or two times by this "race" using artificial methods. Within ten years, every healthy woman in the world could give birth to one or two babies for this "race," even with scientists specifying that they be male. Thirty years later, the world will be filled with third-generation grandchildren born of the same father.

If that "race" was only twenty years old at the time of the bombing and could live healthily to seventy, he might even see a "four-generation family" under "one world." This is faster than we expect.

What follows is based on the assumptions of the original "Fable." "Continuing the Dog's Tail" as follows.

First, please forgive the reader. In the following narrative, for convenience and to save words, the pen will use some words that are common in science books but are disdained by "hypocrites."

Artificial insemination

The "Fable" hypothesizes that all men except one lucky one have lost their reproductive capacity, while all women seem to be healthy. As long as the reproductive function of that one man does not disappear and is healthy and normal, then the problem of the reproduction of the human race is not as serious as imagined. People will recover at an ultra-fast rate under the "one ancestor."

The first remedy is "artificial insemination." This method has long been very common in the breeding of animals and livestock. For example, for a good stud horse, livestock experts often use a relatively simple method to separate the viable reproductive cells (sperm) excreted by the horse in one go and inject them into four to more than ten female horses, allowing them to be fertilized and conceived. This stud horse and the "crowd of female horses" do not need to have any sexual behavior in contact with each other.

In humans, the same method is also used in medicine. For example, if it is known that the reproductive cells (sperm and eggs) of a male and female are both normal, but there is some reason that they cannot meet and be fertilized, this artificial method is also used to assist. In recent years, the technology and tools in this area have been improving day by day, so the pregnancy rate is also increasing year by year. Many people have "instant success" after one artificial assistance, and half of them "get a son"!

However, there is a difference between humans and animals. Because there is no need, no one has ever investigated how many women can be "artificially inseminated" with the reproductive cells excreted by one man at a time.

Theoretically speaking

Theoretically speaking, as long as one male reproductive cell meets with one female reproductive cell, it can become a "fertilized egg" and grow into a "fetus." God knows why it is so wasteful: taking a one-child-per-three-year system for one husband and one wife, the male excretes at least hundreds of millions of reproductive cells during this period. However, only a tiny, lucky male reproductive cell has the opportunity to become a "fertilized egg."

That "necessity is the mother of invention," and we have every reason to believe that scientists can invent "one sperm, one pregnancy," that is, 100% "artificial pregnancy" when needed. In this way, as mentioned earlier, within three to ten years, hundreds of millions of healthy women of childbearing age around the world can raise one or two babies for this male "race." This is not entirely a fantasy. Readers may worry that this "race" will be exhausted from moving back and forth between the two hemispheres and the five continents. In fact, there is no need for this, because scientists have long found a way to keep the male reproductive cells well-maintained outside the human body without reducing their activity and reproductive capacity. In addition, with the ubiquitous ultra-fast long-distance air transportation in recent years, the "dad" may be in the Arctic Ocean, but the "mom" is raising a baby for him in the equator!

People with "worldliness" may worry about the excessive consumption of this "race." In fact, this is also unnecessary. The replenishment of reproductive power is nothing more than the replenishment of reproductive endocrine, that is, "sex hormones." For decades, the Chinese have eaten "ox penis" and "monkey testicles" as "kidney tonics." In today's scientific medicine, there is something called "organ therapy," and there is no difference in principle and method. However, after a massive explosion of atomic energy, since all men have lost their reproductive capacity, I am afraid that the male animals at that time have also lost their male reproductive capacity. This method still does not work.

Fortunately, "artificial synthetic chemistry" has made great progress in recent years. "Testosterone," one of the male hormones, has been successfully manufactured by chemists in test tubes and is sold well on the market. According to the conclusions published in specialist journals, even "castrated" or "man-made castrated" people such as eunuchs can immediately restore their reproductive function with this artificial synthetic compound. There is no problem in replenishing the healthy "race"!

All babies are male

The "Fable" did not mention that female reproductive capacity has disappeared, then quickly raising a batch of male babies is an urgent task under the "population policy."

We know that the reason for the difference between men and women is that there are two kinds of reproductive cells in their father's reproductive cells. One kind becomes a male fetus, and the other kind becomes a female fetus.

According to a scientific report published by the Soviet Union last year, they have a way to use "ionization" to collect sperm under one "electrode" to produce only male babies, and the other "electrode" to produce only female babies. Although the detailed method has not been published, it seems undeniable that scientists have done this.

Pregnant after husband's death

From the above, we can infer that relying on this one "race" and using artificial methods to make every existing woman bear a boy for him within ten years, at the most conservative, it can be said that there is such a possible opportunity.

If he was only twenty years old when the atomic bomb exploded, then on his fiftieth birthday he will see his second generation and daughters-in-law all over the world congratulate him. He still has vigorous reproductive power at that time.

At seventy, his third-generation daughters-in-law congratulate him.

If he unfortunately dies before he is fifty, don't be afraid, because in the last years of this World War, scientists used low temperature and other special methods to preserve sperm outside the male body for five or ten years without any change, so even ten years after the "race" dies, his "sons" can continue to be born.

The only unfortunate thing

We do not know whether this "race" has any defects or bad genetic factors in his body and brain. If so, "the eternal catastrophe of mankind" will continue for a long time. Because from the third generation onwards, or even from the second generation onwards, they are all blood marriages, brothers and sisters, cousins, and cousins, and all heritable adverse factors will increase and never decline, until mankind truly sinks and perishes!

Therefore, I also oppose using atomic bombs to kill mankind.

### A Short History of Peng Xuepei

— Huang Jieqing

With the ceasefire between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and the National Congress in session, Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei has become one of the most silent figures.

Mr. Peng is from Anfu, Jiangxi, courtesy name Haoxu, and is only forty-eight years old. He studied at Tokyo Imperial University in Japan and lived in Japan for seven years. Later, he transferred to France and obtained a degree in economics from the University of Brussels in Belgium. He returned to China in 1925 and served as a professor at Peking University and the College of Law and Politics. His moving lectures certainly won the enthusiastic support of young students.

Mr. Peng entered politics in the summer of 1927, when he served as the director of education at the Kuomintang Shanghai Party Affairs Training Institute. Later, he was promoted to Vice Minister of the Interior, Vice Minister of Political Affairs of the Executive Yuan, and Vice Minister of Communications. Recently, he was appointed Minister of Propaganda of the Central Committee, becoming an important figure on the political stage.

Mr. Peng once entered Wang Jingwei's inner circle, and the host and guest were very happy. When Wang Jingwei advocated peace, Mr. Peng's will was firm and he was not moved. Therefore, he was able to maintain his political position, and today he is even relied on by President Song as his right-hand man.

In December 1927, the Shanghai Central Daily News was founded, and Mr. Peng was appointed editor-in-chief. He is the author of books such as "Political Parties in Europe, America and Japan" and "Monetary Policies in China and Foreign Countries."

He is indeed a politician who is familiar with finance and economics.

Mr. Peng is not very tall. He used to have a short beard, which made him look like a sage. He shaved it off after the victory, which slightly reduced his dignity, but made him look more energetic.

Shanghai Cross-Section

### The Organization of Beggars

— Huang Jiamo

In Peking opera, there are always dragon extras. Whenever dukes, marquises, generals, and ministers appear, there are always four or more dragon extras lined up on the left and right, standing there like wooden chickens. Every major theater has its own base team, specializing in serving as these moving backdrops. However, there are many small-scale opera troupes in Shanghai, which are usually limited in their expenditures, and the number of people in the base team is very limited. When a larger number of dragon extras is needed temporarily, they can only be supplied by the old brothers in the beggar gang. Later, because the need for this kind of extra gradually increased, there were people in the gang who specialized in serving as these dragon extras. They are collectively known as "Dragon Generals."

Those among the beggars who serve as these semi-permanent dragon extras are mostly neat in appearance and have in fact broken away from the original appearance of the beggars. These are the long-grown beggars who specialize in this, and the little ghosts are not qualified to be selected due to their age. Whenever a theater has its own base team, it is enough to supply the few dragon generals needed on weekdays. But if a new play is being rehearsed and five or six dragon generals are needed, and the base team is only enough for three, they have to ask the old brothers to disassemble the bowls and dishes. Although the time that the dragon extras appear on stage each time is not very prominent, because Wei, Shu, and Wu were originally opposed, Cao Cao's dragon extras cannot appear in Zhao Yun's hall, for fear that the audience will recognize them and ruin the plot of the play. Now that there are ready-made dragon generals that can be hired, and they are paid on a daily basis, the theater is naturally happy to hire them. Those who do this do not need any skills, but there are certain routes and regulations for entering and exiting the stage. A single step of difference will make you embarrassed on the spot, and the audience will never tolerate it. The Dragon Generals have a lot of experience in this, and outsiders naturally dare not steal this job.

Dragon Generals are at least four people in a group, and there are also first, second, and third classes among the four people. The person leading the way in and out is the first class, because their actions must advance and retreat according to the joints of the plot, which is very important, so the salary is higher than the other three.

In addition to the Dragon Generals, there is also a kind of person who plays wealthy women, usually these Dragon Generals in drag. But only those with a neat and well-proportioned body can serve. This is considered rare in the gang, and the reward is more than double that of male dragon extras. If there is an opportunity to serve as a member of the Ling class, they will also not tire of gathering here, because their livelihood can be solved. After a year and a half, no one would have imagined that those ancient costume maids on the stage with beautiful eyes were originally wandering children sleeping in buckets and fighting for food!

Before the war, Shanghai was extremely prosperous in the private opera performances. If wealthy or well-to-do families had happy events, they would always invite amateur opera singers or small opera troupes to perform. The dragon generals and palace maids that were needed were often not available for loan from the theater, so they had to ask the wholesale department of these wild dragon generals. The rewards for private performances are more generous than those in the theater. In addition to eating and drinking, they can also ask for auspicious gifts. In addition, if they can follow famous actors to perform opera in other ports, the income is even more considerable. Everyone in the industry regards it as a lucrative business. They all spare no effort in seeking activities, hoping to get the opportunity to run the wharf!

Low-key

### Dead People Care Most About Face

— Shigu

The winter relief committee is raising donations. It is said that the results of the two days are not as good as those of the Pushan Villa. Some people say: "Shanghai people like to ask dead people to do things," and others say: "Because dead people care most about face"!

### Unity

— Shigu

It is said that the unity of the Chinese people can be demonstrated on the road:

When a jeep runs over and kills someone, in less than a minute, the scene of the accident is immediately united. Although the unity is strong, everyone has the mentality of watching the excitement. They don't ask or hear anything. After the matter is over, everyone scatters in a rush, so this sentence of "five minutes" seems to be correct?

### With Joy and Fear

— Nanming

The number of purchasers of luxury goods in companies and stores has decreased. Some say this is a manifestation of the people's noble frugality, while others say it is a harbinger of the collapse of the social economy. Both statements make sense, so it is: one with joy, one with fear!

### Shanghai's "Shangri-La"

— Gui

Standing next to the east side of the Dahua Theater on Nanjing West Road, there is a red Western-style building with a history of more than ten years, occupying more than two acres. Although many people pass by all day and all night, few people know the equipment and organization inside. This house was first built by Jewish people and housed the Jewish General Association. Later, the Jewish General Association moved to the intersection of Moore Road and Zhongzheng Middle Road. The place was rented to the Shanghai Race Club, and then rented to the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment by the Race Club. Then came the Pacific War. The Marine Regiment had already withdrawn, and the Japanese Army occupied it, setting up the Army Department and the Propaganda Department there. After the victory, the National Army temporarily occupied it for a while, and then it was changed to the current U.S. Navy Club.

The internal organization of the club is managed by the Navy, which manages everything inside and outside. Although the people entering and leaving the club are generally soldiers, Admiral Kirk also comes often. The last time U.S. Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal came to Shanghai, he hurriedly made a tour with Admiral Kirk after the banquet hosted by Mayor Wu at ten o'clock. Regardless of the size of the official position, the enjoyment inside is the same for everyone, without distinction. The Western food served is limited in price, and the limited price is enforced by the Navy. For example, steak, pork chops, iron-grilled chicken, etc. are only 2,000 yuan in legal tender per dish. The price of coffee is the same as that sold by street vendors on the road. The rest, such as beer, Coca-Cola, and cigarettes, are allocated by the military. Because of the tax-free price advantage, stores cannot compete with it, thus affecting the bars outside, which are closing one by one. On the day of July 4th, which is the American Memorial Day, whiskey, sandwiches, Coca-Cola, etc. in the club were supplied free of charge as much as possible, which really made people admire their meticulous care for the soldiers.

Dancing is one of the most popular entertainments for Americans. The dance floor is set up on the second floor, and the size of the dance floor is the same as that of the MGM. The band is hired from Shanghai. The band is now playing by black people's bands, but sometimes it is performed by bands formed by the Navy and Marine Corps. It is mostly on Saturdays and holidays. Pan Yuzhen's performance is also indispensable. The partners brought by the soldiers are mostly Russians and Chinese. The ones with the most complicated status are the Chinese, including Jeep girls, socialites, dancers, salty water girls, students, and writing office staff. What is most regrettable is the general students and nurses who have received higher education. They are unwilling to show their faces in front of the Chinese people, so as not to see acquaintances. The general salty water girls are the most funny. Their names are all called Lolita, Lillian, etc. The English they speak is so good that people can't believe they are in this industry. As for those who can't speak, they gesticulate, which is too numerous to list.

The films are shown by the soldiers themselves, two shows a day, at 4:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. The films they showed a long time ago have almost not been released in the theaters yet. The most famous one is "One Night in Paradise," starring Manuel Aubran, which is a full-color mythological film. They showed it this year in June. The other films are the latest, and the films are changed every two days.

There are also other entertainment such as chess rooms, libraries, and table tennis rooms. The enjoyment of the soldiers is unmatched even by the so-called high-class Chinese. One sighs!

### Big Sale

Recalling before the victory, there was a shortage of materials, imported goods were cut off, and prices were rising sharply due to the manipulation of speculators. At that time, stores simply didn't want to do business. As for holding a big sale, it was almost foolish. But now the momentum of the big sale is so high, and the banner of the big sale is everywhere.

Everywhere on the street are stores that are promoting big sales. The radio is broadcasting incessantly all day long, or hiring simple bands, playing vulgar music, hanging lanterns and decorations, and colorful. The scene of this lively prosperity is really beyond description. Another way of holding a big sale is to close all the rows of doors, leaving only a small door for entry and exit. Outside the door are posted eye-catching and stimulating slogans such as "Closing Down Sale," which is really unique! Newspapers are also full of huge advertisements for big sales, but these are not easy to move people's hearts!

The big sales of stores are rarely for the sake of "treating customers well." In fact, they all have great difficulties. Recently, the fluctuations in prices have not been great, and high interest rates are rampant. Merchants are naturally unwilling to keep their goods for a long time while paying interest. They all deeply understand that now is not the time to hoard and speculate. Only by selling goods early and turning over flexibly can they make money. Moreover, the end of the year is approaching, and everyone should have an end to the debts, and the expenses for their own New Year should also be settled. Under these circumstances, the big sale, which is like a raging fire and seems crazy, is held comprehensively.

But for several years, people's lives have been tortured and exhausted, and purchasing power is generally low. What is the use of a big sale?

The big sale is lively, but on careful thought, you want to cry! (To be continued) We solicit the following:

### Cockfighting in America

If we say that cockfighting is a movement, then its nature is the same as horse racing—a gambling sport.

Cockfighting was popular in the United States very early. Former presidents Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln were all "cockfighting enthusiasts." Later, various states, considering cockfighting to be a waste of money and manpower, enacted laws to ban it. Currently, except for Florida, which does not ban non-gambling cockfighting, all other states ban cockfighting itself.

Despite this, from Maine in the north to Florida in the south, and from New York in the east to Wyoming in the west, there are still hundreds of cockfighting finals every year. Large-scale competitions and championships are held in secret. Millions of US dollars in bets are exchanged between owners. Thousands of carefully bred fighting cocks fight to the death every day. Tens of thousands of entertainment tax dollars become the "hosting fees" for the "uncle class" organizers of cockfights.

Because cockfighting is illegal, the venues are all in remote places, and the times are all at night. Below is a "route slip" that the host notified gamblers to find the cockfighting arena for a certain cockfight:

"Drive south along US Highway 60006, pass Blackwell by two miles, then leave the highway and proceed right along the gravel road. After proceeding six and a quarter miles along the gravel road, pass a bridge; after passing the bridge, turn left into the second dirt road, and the third alley on the right side of the dirt road will lead directly to the cockfighting arena."

The cockfighting arena is guarded all around. Entering the arena requires paying an entrance fee of about five dollars, plus a tenth of the "entertainment tax." The cockfighting arena is usually built inside existing large stables or granaries, with the doors tightly closed to prevent lights and shouts from being revealed. The internal atmosphere is as tense as a boxing ring, and the cockfighting arena is illuminated by a 1,000-candlepower mercury lamp.

The weapons of the fighting cocks, in addition to their natural sharp beaks and sharp spurs, are that the cock owner also installs a one-and-a-half-inch-long steel hook on their spurs, which is as sharp as a needle. The steel hook is nailed to a piece of leather. This piece of leather is wrapped around the chicken's leg, and then tightly tied with thread. The feathers of the fighting cock's tail and wings are also trimmed.

Before the cockfight, gamblers freely look for people with opposing opinions to bet with, and they can bet at any time during the cockfight. - The most active among them are of course the cock owners with the strongest confidence.

Before the cockfight begins, the two cock owners each hold their own chicken, making them peck at each other with their beaks to arouse their fighting spirit. Then, like the start of a boxing match, they retreat to a corner, and wait for the referee to give an order, then release the chickens, and let them gather in the center of the ring to fight with all their strength.

The process of cockfighting is indeed stimulating enough, but you can see four feet leaping, feathers spreading, and the movements are so fast that you can't take care of it all. But it is also cruel enough. Where the steel hook starts, blood is dripping. Sometimes it hooks the eye, and even the eyeball will be hooked out.

During the fighting process, if one of the chickens is injured and falls to the ground, just like in a boxing match, the referee can order a temporary suspension of the fight, and the cock owner will help the chicken up and use various methods to restore the injured chicken's fighting ability. At this time, the referee counts one, two, three..., and when he counts to twenty (large fifteen-second bell), if the fallen chicken cannot "return to the workplace", it is considered to have lost.

In addition, there is also a "Cockfighting Championship", which is not about betting, but about winning the grand prize. Each cock owner brings a few fighting cocks (usually four to eight) to participate, and each person pays a certain amount of participation fee, which is collected as a bonus. The first prize amount ranges from twenty-five yuan to one thousand yuan, sometimes more.

After the participation fees are collected, the weights of the fighting cocks are measured, and the weights of each pair of fighters must be nearly equal - this concept is also derived from boxing matches. In addition to the championship, there is also a "Grand Championship", which is a combination of several small championships held together. Ordinary championships have no small prizes in addition to the first prize, while grand championships often have a second prize, and sometimes a third prize is added. For example, in a Grand Championship held by combining ten one-thousand-yuan prize championships, the prize money of this ten thousand yuan is usually distributed as follows: first prize six thousand yuan, second prize three thousand yuan, and third prize one thousand yuan.

Gambling is a weakness of human nature. If the mentality of luck cannot be thoroughly eliminated, underground gambling cannot be completely prohibited by law.
