### The Railway Management Section Commences Work, Striving to Restore Transportation With All Efforts, Transportation Teams Will Be Dispatched to Various Locations

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 15th] The Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation in Peiping has been established for over a month. The four key tasks of stopping conflict, restoring transportation, accepting surrender, and repatriating prisoners have achieved good results through the sincere cooperation of the government, the Communist Party, and the United States. Regarding stopping conflict, there have been no significant conflict incidents in most areas due to the efforts of the executive teams. To restore transportation, a Railway Management Section has been specially added to be in charge of this matter. Although there are still various technical problems to be resolved, the restoration of transportation is a common goal of all three parties, and it is believed that it can be completed smoothly. The surrender acceptance work is complete, as the Japanese troops in the China Theater have long been disarmed. If the transportation network can be restored within three months, the repatriation of prisoners can be promoted smoothly. Therefore, restoring transportation has become the key to the success or failure of the Executive Headquarters' entire work.

[Our Correspondent, Peiping, 15th] The Executive Headquarters issued Public Communiqué No. 11 today, stating that the Railway Management Section has commenced work. It is also learned that the Headquarters has instructed teams in various locations to quickly report where to dispatch transportation teams to facilitate early dispatch and to order all teams to supervise road repairs nearby.

It is reported that the Executive Headquarters has ordered the Guangzhou team to investigate the Communist-held areas. The team is already under investigation. Furthermore, the Communist side is scheduled to hold a cocktail party on the 18th to entertain officials from all parties and the American representatives.

### The Yunnan Economic Commission and Enterprise Bureau Will Be Reorganized and Established Within Two Months

[Our Correspondent, Kunming, 14th (Special Dispatch)] The Yunnan Economic Commission and the Enterprise Bureau were originally the two major industrial and economic systems in Yunnan Province. The former was presided over by Miao Jiaming, a non-partisan representative to the Political Consultative Conference, and the latter was presided over by Central Committee member Lu Chongren. After the provincial government meeting passed the reorganization measures on December 14 last year, these two major institutions were reorganized. The provincial government designated Li Yinquan, Ding Youqiu, Miao Jiaming, Gong Zhongjun, Zhu Lidong, Xu Yushu, Wu Shisheng, and Li Yiting as members of the preparatory committee, with Miao as the chairman. Lu Chongren, the head of the Enterprise Bureau, was listed as one of the advisory committee members of the company. While Miao Jiaming was in Chongqing attending the Consultative Conference, the Economic Commission and the Enterprise Bureau rushed to complete the handover. When Miao returned to Kunming in early this month, he made some decisions regarding personnel and technical issues in various departments. The provincial参政会also suggested yesterday that former employees of the provincial government and former employees of the Economic Commission and the Enterprise Bureau should avoid participating in the People's Enterprise Company, and telegraphed Li Yiping and Xie Xianji to return to Kunming as soon as possible to assist in the company's preparations. Kunming reporters, wanting to investigate the truth of this matter, were rejected by the preparatory committee, causing an incident. It is reported that the company plans to be established within two months. The following is a summary of the organizational principles: (1) The company's equity belongs to three types of people. After its organization is completed, it must ensure that all the people of Yunnan have the right to "self-operate, self-own, and self-enjoy." (2) The distribution of equity should be equal and fair. In the initial stage, it should reach every township, and after the household registration survey of the whole province is completed, it should be popularized to every bao, jia, and household. (3) In the initial stage, the equity is temporarily based on the township as a unit, and the equity is managed by the township people's representative meeting. The benefits generated by the company are decided by the shareholders' representative meeting, and in the township, they are decided by the township people's representative meeting. The scope should be limited to sanitation, education, and economy. The establishment of this company can be regarded as the largest and most well-funded provincial-level enterprise in our country.

According to reliable sources, this "secret information" is related to atomic energy, and the certain country refers to the Soviet Union. The homes of many former and current civil servants in government departments and agencies have been searched. It is understood that some of them once worked at the National Research Council, the government agency that disseminates information related to atomic energy. It is generally believed that the government will formally announce which country obtained this secret.

[Associated Press, Ottawa, 16th] King announced today that two judges of the Canadian Supreme Court have begun a secret investigation into a case of leaking secret information to a certain foreign country. Minister of Reconstruction Howe, who has jurisdiction over Canadian atomic energy research, announced in his statement that the atomic bomb issue was not involved. Pearson, a New York reporter, predicted last Sunday that a certain Canadian official would soon be interrogated for providing information to the Soviet Union. This morning, in the front page of the New York "Daily Mirror," he directly pointed out that the Soviet Union possessed a spy network of 1,700 agents in the United States and Canada, and that one of them who obtained the atomic bomb construction plan was one of them. Pearson also said that the case was solved when the Soviet agents surrendered and gave the names and addresses of the remaining 1,700 people. Soviet agents also incited civil servants in the United States and Canada to cooperate with the Soviet Union. Mr. Pearson put forward the names of several American labor leaders and claimed that the State Department had allowed Brahmond, a Soviet national who obtained the atomic bomb plan in Washington before, to board a ship and return to his country, because officials clearly stated that arresting the agent was secondary and would cause diplomatic consequences with the Soviet Union, and that the Soviet Union might already have the atomic bomb.

[Agence France-Presse, Ottawa, 15th] After Canadian Prime Minister King announced the leak of secret information, it was announced here today that the authorities are investigating the sale of a uranium mine (atomic bomb manufacturing material) to a foreign government in recent months. Several people have been arrested, including the French scientist Baron. However, this matter is not related to the Prime Minister's statement, because the Prime Minister only refers to the illegal sale of radium ingots.

### When Testing the Power of the Atomic Bomb, 100 US Warships Participate; British Professor Says Atomic Energy Can Be Conquered Within Ten Years

[United Press, Alameda, California, 16th] The test of the atomic bomb's power against warships will be held near Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean starting May 1. It is understood that about 100 ships will participate. It is reported that during the test: it may be divided into several times, gradually destroyed. Each time after the radiation energy decreases, scientists will go forward for inspection, until all ships are completely destroyed. The aircraft carrier Saratoga is ready to participate in the test. Former US Air Force Commander General Arnold announced on the 15th that when testing the power of the atomic bomb against warships, Air Force observers will seek to answer the following questions: (1) How far can an aircraft approach the explosion site without being destroyed? (2) How strong is the radiation in the air near the explosion site? (3) Is there radiation in the huge cloud rising from the explosion site? At that time, a special team of the Air Force will use ten radio-controlled B17 aircraft, without human power to take off and land. Starting March 1, 30 transport aircraft will carry aviation personnel to and from Bikini Island every day.

[United Press, London, 15th] Professor Oliphant from the University of Birmingham, who participated in the manufacture of the atomic bomb experiment, predicted today that atomic energy can be conquered within ten years and used for industrial purposes.

### My Representative Explains Views on the Levant's Request for Troop Withdrawal; Advocates Direct Negotiations Between Concerned Countries; The Security Council's Discussion This Morning Again Yields No Results

[This Newspaper News] London broadcasted on the 16th that the United Nations Security Council discussed the complaints of Lebanon and Syria today, but no results were achieved. After adjourning for four hours, it will discuss again. During this morning's meeting, Soviet representative Vyshinsky suggested that the countries concerned conduct negotiations as soon as possible. The British representative said, "Under permissible circumstances, British troops will withdraw as early as possible."

[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] At a meeting of the United Nations Security Council today to discuss the application of Syria and Lebanon to request the withdrawal of troops from Britain and France, many representatives of various countries spoke in support. Dr. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China, also delivered a simple and practical speech, explaining the views of the Chinese government, which roughly stated: The principle raised by this matter is that without the clear consent of the government of the host country, foreign troops are stationed in the territory of another country, and this other country is an allied country. This situation clearly restricts the sovereignty of a country and is contrary to the spirit of the United Nations Charter and international law. Any troops should withdraw after completing their mission and achieving their goals. We believe that the best way to resolve the problem is for the countries concerned to adopt negotiation procedures. We hope that these negotiations will proceed smoothly and report to the Security Council at any time.

[Reuters, London, 16th] Soviet representative Vyshinsky stated in the Security Council yesterday that the Soviet Union fully supports the demands of Syria and Lebanon. US representative Stettinius believes that if direct negotiations to resolve the Levant issue continue, the Council should retain the right to instruct them to report on the progress.

### Polish Troops in the British Army; Poland Demands Immediate Dissolution; Says Senior Officers Are Engaged in Anti-Government Activities; Soviets Complain About the Mobilization of Polish Troops in Southern China

[This Newspaper News] London broadcasted on the 16th that the Polish government sent a diplomatic note to Britain today, announcing that all Polish troops abroad should be abolished.

[British News Agency, London, 16th] The British government has received a note from the Polish government requesting the rapid dissolution of the Polish troops serving in the British army.

Furthermore, the freedom of the officers and soldiers of this unit to return home has been deprived.

[United Press, London, 15th] The Polish government submitted a note to Britain today, stating that there are 107,000 Polish troops who were previously under the command of the Central Army Command and fought in Italy. Now that the war is over, it should be requested to demobilize these troops and send them back to their country. A British Foreign Office spokesman said that this note came suddenly and was quite surprising. This move and the UN Security Council's rejection of Soviet accusations against British troops stationed in Greece and the East Indies may be related.

[This Newspaper News] London broadcasted on the 16th that Soviet representative Vyshinsky submitted a memorandum to UN Secretary-General Relye on behalf of the Yugoslav delegation, saying that the Polish army in Italy has advanced towards the Yugoslav border. Vyshinsky believes that this move by the Polish army is a great threat to world peace. Vyshinsky also pointed out that the Polish army is now shouting slogans to overthrow communism.

### Local Dispatches

Songjiang: Local Histories Urgently Need Organization

The method for compiling local gazetteers in this county was promulgated by the Ministry of the Interior in July of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944). According to the provisions of Article 3, provincial gazetteers should be compiled once every thirty years, and city and county gazetteers once every fifteen years. However, local documents have suffered many losses due to the impact of the War of Resistance. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, local gazetteers urgently need to be collected and organized for reference in policy implementation. Therefore, the Ministry of the Interior has instructed all counties to promptly send two copies of local gazetteers, along with a survey form, and to report the compilation situation in detail. After receiving the order, the county government has sent personnel to investigate and report, and plans to set up a gazetteer compilation hall to be responsible for the compilation work.

Pinghu: Tragic Bus Accident on the Pingjia Highway

Following yesterday's murder case on the Pingzha section, another tragic bus accident occurred on the Pingjia section. The accident site was near the Jiaoyang Bridge at Shigedizhijiao, about two miles away from Jiaoshanmen. Two buses, one from Pingjia and one from Pingzha, arrived at the site one after the other. Unexpectedly, the driver of the Pingzha bus in the rear suddenly accelerated to the left side of the road, hoping to overtake the Pingjia bus. The driver did not honk the horn, causing the Pingjia bus to avoid it hastily, resulting in a tragic rollover accident. The bus was carrying fifty or sixty passengers and hawkers in the roof compartment. A female passenger, being small in stature, suffocated to death on the spot. Others suffered broken bones and bleeding, a very tragic sight. The police bureau has summoned the persons in charge of both companies and the driver for thorough investigation.

Kunshan: Three Bandits Sentenced to Death: Bandits Yao Renlin, Yao Yongquan, and Chen Heshang, repeatedly ganged up to rob farmers, reaching more than sixty households, and extorted large sums of money under false pretenses, setting fire to houses.

### After Eight Years of Hardship, Her Beauty Remains Unchanged: Spring Light Shines Again on West Lake

—Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng Reports from Hangzhou

The first spring after victory has arrived, let's go to Hangzhou!

For the past eight or nine years, the natural scenery of Hangzhou has not changed, but in Lingyin, near Jingci Temple, on Su Causeway, and on Bai Causeway, there have been enemy sentries, and passage was not allowed. Boating on West Lake once required compliance with unreasonable regulations, so even the people of Hangzhou were too lazy to visit. The bright spring has finally arrived, and the wild geese on West Lake are happily waiting for tourists! This reporter went to Hangzhou two days after the Beginning of Spring.

Two Bronze Statues Have Been Recovered; Centuries-Old Phoebe Becomes a Coffin

Lakeside Park is not as full of flowers as it used to be. Except for a few trees, it is all flat ground. The iron chain railing by the lake has recently been renovated, but the round lamps on the railing posts have not yet been installed. The Monument to the Martyrs of the 88th Division still stands, majestic in appearance, no less so than in the past. The two bronze statues were recently salvaged from West Lake. The decoration of the boats is not as good as it used to be, with four wooden planks on each side as railings. Standing on the Lakeside and looking around, the surrounding mountains are not as lush and lovely as they were eight years ago, leaving only the bare remains of barren hills. This is naturally the gift of the "Imperial Army" because they and the big and small traitors had already cut down the trees on the four mountains, either turning them into firewood or selling them all. It is said that a phoebe tree over two hundred years old on Nanshan was cut down by the leader of the traitors in the enemy's special service agency to make a coffin.

The Old Man Under the Moon Thrown into the Lake; Only a Withered Temple Remains; Citizens Cut Down Cherry Blossoms to Show Determination

At the foot of Nanshan, there used to be a shrine to the Old Man Under the Moon, but it was demolished under the violence of the enemy, and the "Old Man" had long been thrown into the lake by them. On Su Causeway, there used to be a beautiful scene of "willows interspersed with peaches," but when the enemy was present, they planted cherry blossoms instead. Now, all of them have been uprooted by the lovely people of Hangzhou. It is said that the total number of cherry trees planted by the enemy in the entire Hangzhou area reached millions, but not a single one survived. "Viewing Fish at Flower Harbor" has also been completely demolished, leaving only broken walls and ruins, unbearable to look at!

Plum Blossoms on Gushan Are Budding; Arhats in Lingyin Await Resculpting

The boat sails across the outer lake and reaches the inner lake, but the Expo Bridge no longer exists. The Crane Releasing Pavilion seems to have been recently repaired. The plum blossoms on Gushan are budding. A Temple of Wealth near the tomb of Lin Bu is still thriving, undamaged, presumably because the enemies had dreams of getting rich in Hangzhou!

A pavilion in Zhongshan Park has been demolished. Only the "Clear Sky Fine Rain Pool" and the "Pearl Spring" in Yuquan Temple are still intact because the enemies did not spoil them. On the way to Lingyin, several large houses were burned down by the enemies, and even the temple gate was burned down. Some people selling prayer beads and canes in the temple and setting up tea stalls have started doing business. The Arhat Hall of Lingyin has been burned to ashes. According to the monks in the temple, it will be difficult to resculpt the five hundred Arhats because there are no drawings. These five hundred Arhats have five hundred different dynamic poses, and sculpting them is not easy!

Bai Causeway Without Flowers Is Truly a White Causeway; Flower Houses at Jiangzhuang Become Kitchens

The boat sails out of the inner lake, passes the Dongpo Bridge of Su Causeway through the outer lake, and turns into Yue Lake, where weeds are overgrown, making navigation difficult. Only a stone tablet remains at "Breeze-Ruffled Lotus at the Crooked Courtyard." Yue Wang Temple is no different, and vendors selling canes and prayer beads have set up shops in the temple.

Following Bai Causeway back, the flower pavilions on both sides of Bai Causeway in the past have disappeared. "Broken Bridge with Lingering Snow" truly has a sense of "brokenness" and "lingering"!

Touring the villas in the lake, one cannot help but sigh at the changes of the past and present! The antiques in Liu Zhuang were emptied by the enemies, Kang Zhuang was demolished, and only Jiang Zhuang is open now, but the flower houses in the villa have become kitchens.

The prices here are not cheap. A very ordinary meal for three people costs four thousand five hundred yuan. The fare for a rickshaw from the railway station to the lakeside is eight hundred yuan. An ordinary single room in a hotel costs two thousand eight hundred and eighty yuan. I hope this is not the norm, otherwise, the people of Hangzhou will really not be able to afford it! Some say that the prices here are rising along with Shanghai, but in fact, they have exceeded Shanghai.

Late at night, gentle music plays on the shores of West Lake. Oh! This is the time for the citizens to dance happily! (February 15th)

### Organizational Problems of Industrial and Commercial Groups

[Report from this Newspaper, Chongqing Airmail] The organizational problems of industrial and commercial groups have attracted much attention from the people in the recovered areas since the victory. Yesterday, the reporter visited Zhai Jingshen, the section chief in charge of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and received the following response.

Regarding the organization of industrial and commercial groups such as chambers of commerce and trade associations, please first talk about their current situation. The organization of industrial and commercial groups can be broadly divided into basic organizations and vocational organizations. The basic organizations are county, city, district, and town chambers of commerce, as well as trade associations for various industries such as commerce, industry, and mining. The joint organizations are provincial federations of chambers of commerce, the national federation of chambers of commerce, and federations of trade associations for various industries. As of the end of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), 1,236 chambers of commerce had been organized and approved by the Ministry of Social Affairs, and 9,340 trade associations, totaling 10,576. Including those reported to the Ministry of Social Affairs and registered after verification and correction, the total reached 14,360. The above figures are for the chambers of commerce and trade associations in the rear provinces and cities. The recovered areas are still under adjustment. As for the joint organizations, provincial federations of chambers of commerce have been established in all provinces in the rear, except Xinjiang. Only the Yunnan and Guangdong federations need to be readjusted because the establishment procedures were not in compliance. However, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce was approved for organization in June of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944) and was scheduled to be established at the end of that year, but the war in Guilin and Liuzhou forced its postponement. In the summer of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), the situation improved, and preparations were resumed, and were largely complete. It was decided to be established on November 1st, but the sudden surrender of Japan made restoration measures very urgent, and the representatives from the provinces and cities in the previously occupied areas, produced by wartime expediency, were difficult to recognize as legitimate. Therefore, it was decided to wait until the chambers of commerce and trade associations in the recovered areas were adjusted before it could be established, so it was decided to set a date for convening after the return to the capital. In the 34th year of the Republic (1945), important industrial and commercial federations established included machinery, cotton textiles, matches, automobiles, as well as the Sichuan River, Min River, Tong River, Jin River, and civilian shipping industries, either nationwide or divided according to production areas and rivers. This type of joint organization was unprecedented. In addition, the National Federation of Flour Industries has also been approved for organization and will be established soon. Various places in Sichuan are also actively preparing to organize federations of various important export industries. This trend shows that the organization of industrial and commercial groups has gradually progressed from "points" to "surfaces" or "lines," and is mostly initiated automatically out of their own needs, unlike in the past when the government needed to promote them.

Now that the current situation of the organization of industrial and commercial groups has been clarified, we can proceed to review the policy issues. During the war, the government had many restrictions on the people, and the organization of groups required prior application and permission. Now that the war is over, the central government has repeatedly declared that it will implement democracy and guarantee freedom. The current laws and regulations on assembly and association are being actively revised or abolished. The purpose of high-level associations is to seek common welfare for the country and to correct malpractices. They are a type of public interest group as defined by the Civil Code. Whether or not to adopt a pre-approval system still needs to be studied. Secondly, the industrial and commercial sectors have contributed a lot to the country in the past eight years, and have suffered the greatest losses after the victory. In the future, they will devote themselves to construction, inevitably strengthening the country through industry and enriching the country through commerce. The responsibility of the industrial and commercial sectors is even greater. The Ministry of Social Affairs' guidance in organizing industrial and commercial groups should also have a clear and grand policy to develop in balance with agricultural policies and labor policies. The third issue is the issue of social groups and professional groups. The laws of chambers of commerce and trade associations are particularly strict. Social people, restricted by laws and regulations, seek other ways out, organizing some economic associations and societies to research academics and promote careers. Their intentions are not necessarily bad, and the Ministry of Social Affairs hopes that they can complement the chambers of commerce and trade associations. However, in fact, these national organizations inevitably encroach on the statutory tasks of the chambers of commerce and trade associations, affecting the basic organizations of the chambers of commerce and trade associations. In the future, it seems appropriate to strictly restrict them so that they can develop along the right track. Finally, there is the issue of the organization of industrial and commercial employees. Social organizations take the entire people as their object, and various groups are composed of individuals. However, the chambers of commerce and trade associations take companies, firms, factories, and mines as members. Millions of industrial and commercial employees across the country, except for a very small number who can be member representatives, are not included in the organization. In some places, requests to organize welfare associations are not appropriate or complete. This major omission should be rectified and remedies should be sought urgently.

In addition, there are legal issues worth mentioning. After the Ministry of Social Affairs was reorganized, most of the laws and regulations governing the organization of people's groups were amended or added to successively, but the laws of chambers of commerce and trade associations have not yet been amended. Over the years, the old laws have become outdated and cannot adapt to the current situation, and new laws have not been established, creating many doubts. Although the Ministry of Social Affairs has tried hard to explain, reaching more than seven hundred cases, supplementing loopholes is complicated and chaotic, like trying to untangle silk and getting more entangled. The fundamental problem is to promptly approve and finalize the legislative principles and promulgate new laws.

### Reader Opinions: How to Eliminate Labor Unrest

Mr. Editor: Labor unrest has been surging in this city for the past week. After examining the reasons, they are mostly due to high prices, and the income of ordinary employees cannot maintain a living, so there are demands for improved treatment. The hardship of salaried people can be said to have been a long time coming. Under the heavy pressure of these high prices, based on the demands of life, their treatment should be reasonably adjusted. If the authorities today want to eliminate labor unrest, they should have a comprehensive plan for the treatment of salaried people. For the present, the best thing to do is for the authorities to lead and organize a "Citywide Employee Salary Adjustment Committee" or a similar organization, with the authorities inviting the chairmen of the trade associations of various industries and representatives of both labor and management to be members, responsible for handling the issue of employee treatment. Regarding the regulations on employee salaries, it may be appropriate to refer to the actual situation, first separately determine the base number of employee salaries or wages, and then divide them into grades according to the scale and business conditions of factories, shops, and firms in various industries, and then refer to the monthly cost of living index to make regulations. In this way, there will be no partiality, and there can be some practical assistance to the lives of employees. This is just a principle. Specific measures and details, etc., are waiting for the authorities to make careful and detailed plans. Anonymous reader.

### WEEKLY FORUM HOW TO RAISE FUNDS FOR INDUSTRIAL CONSTRUCTION

— Zhao Tonglian

—Establishing the China Reconstruction Industrial Finance Corporation—

Observing the inner workings of international politics and considering the fundamental needs of nation-building, the urgent task at hand is how to seize time and accelerate the completion of industrialization. After Germany's surrender, although Russia's industry had a good foundation, it continued to contact Britain and the United States for long-term capital to purchase machinery, seeking restoration and further expansion. Similarly, South American countries, as well as the Netherlands and Denmark, are all using their foreign exchange reserves saved before or during the war to order equipment from Britain and the United States. As for countries with highly developed industries such as Britain and the United States, they have even more comprehensive plans for the supply of industrial funds to accelerate industrial reconstruction and construction. In the case of Britain, to facilitate the financing of industrial funds, the "Finance Corporation for Commerce & Industry" was recently established. This company was jointly established by the Bank of England, major joint-stock banks, and insurance trust companies. The authorized capital is 50 million pounds, and the lending limit is three times the capital (this figure is based on memory as I don't have the materials at hand). This loan is also shared by various investment institutions according to their investment proportions. In the case of the United States, to strengthen industrial recovery and promote emerging enterprises, the functions of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation have been greatly expanded. For example, the implementation of participating loans and buying and selling participating loans, and the promotion of real estate mortgages, are all important new initiatives. The lending power of the Washington Export-Import Bank has also been increased from 600 million yuan to 3.5 billion yuan. All these measures are based on a common understanding: that the original banking institutions and functions are insufficient to meet the needs of industrial reconstruction. Looking back at our country, we are still hesitating in principle discussions, and concrete measures have not yet been established. Time is wasted, which is truly worrying!

The basic conditions for building industry are nothing more than capital, technology, and markets. With capital, the problem of technical talent will be solved accordingly. As for the market issue, it depends on reasonable measures in overall economic policy. Therefore, the most urgent issue to be resolved at present is the capital problem.

Industrial construction requires both long-term and short-term funds. The former is mostly used to purchase machinery and equipment and build factory buildings, which takes a longer time and is more difficult to raise. The latter is for the turnover of raw materials, wages, etc., which is short-term and easier to raise. The most difficult part of industrial construction funding in our country is the provision of long-term funds. The main purpose of this proposal is to solve this problem and at the same time reduce the current difficulties in settling foreign exchange.

The machinery needed for the initial stage of industrial construction in our country mostly needs to be purchased from abroad. As for the materials and labor required for factory construction and other projects, most of them can be obtained domestically. The former requires payment in foreign currency, while the latter can be circulated in domestic currency. Therefore, there is a distinction between foreign currency and domestic currency in long-term industrial construction funds. Since this long-term capital cannot be supplied by ordinary banking organizations, it is appropriate to have a specialized institution to coordinate its allocation.

Judging from the current situation, it takes a considerable amount of time to deliver machinery ordered from abroad. Due to wartime inflation and price fluctuations in our country, the exchange rate is not easy to determine for a while. If the exchange rate is uncertain, it will not be easy for manufacturers to settle and purchase the foreign exchange needed to order machinery. If following the official price, it is tantamount to the government giving gifts: it not only creates opportunities for manufacturers to take advantage, but also increases the government's losses, and the foreign exchange fund may not be fully used for its proper purpose. If following the black market exchange rate, it is beyond the reach of the manufacturers' financial resources. If we must wait for the exchange rate to be determined before purchasing in large quantities from abroad, then the restoration and construction will be at least two years behind! Therefore, we believe that in order to promote construction and expedite practical achievements, before the exchange rate can be reasonably adjusted, there must be a transitional measure to enable the industry to engage in reconstruction work as soon as possible, while at the same time not damaging the government's foreign exchange fund. This is the first point.

Industrial construction in our country requires a huge amount of foreign exchange funds. Although the total amount of foreign exchange currently held by the government and the people is considerable, it is still felt that the amount is largely insufficient for the funds required for the entire industrial construction. To achieve rapid industrialization, we must actively find ways to practically guide foreign investment, so that domestic industries can develop rapidly with the help of foreign investment. At the same time, foreign investors must be willing to lend and feel worry-free. This is the second point.

In order to establish the industrial community's credit abroad and to obtain favorable terms for negotiating loans and purchasing machinery, etc., we must have a financially strong financial institution for concentrated and effective utilization. This is the third point.

The long-term domestic currency funds required by factories to build factory buildings and purchase domestic machinery and raw materials should also be specially provided for centralized coordination. This is the fourth point.

If the above four points can be achieved as soon as possible, the industry can immediately follow the government's policy, seize the time, and move forward; there is no need to argue over principles in empty theories, wasting time. After repeated consideration, the author puts forward seven measures for reference by the people of the country.

(1) The National Bank and major commercial banks, trust companies, insurance companies, etc., should jointly invest US$500 million and 5 billion yuan in domestic currency to organize the "China Reconstruction Industrial Finance Corporation" (hereinafter referred to as the "Corporation") as a central institution for guiding foreign investment and raising long-term industrial capital.

(2) The main functions of the Corporation are to act as an agent for manufacturers to negotiate long-term loans and investments from abroad, act as an agent for manufacturers to order machinery and materials, act as a guarantor abroad, pay foreign exchange payments, and directly lend long-term domestic currency and foreign currency funds to domestic factories.

(3) Before the exchange rate is determined, manufacturers can pay a deposit in gold, US dollars, or US dollar savings bonds, US dollar bonds, pounds sterling, and any one or more reliable foreign currencies when ordering machinery from abroad. The required foreign exchange payments, guaranteed or advanced by the Corporation, are still valued according to the respective foreign currencies, and gradually converted and repaid after the exchange rate is determined.

(4) The government can re-guarantee the Corporation's guarantees to foreign governments and people without any conditions for the investments, loans, and financial circles negotiated by the Corporation on behalf of Chinese manufacturers with foreign manufacturers, in order to enhance the Corporation's credit abroad.

(5) All factories that purchase machinery and materials abroad and need the government to assist in the negotiation or provide loans shall be handled by the Corporation in a unified manner, in order to centralize authority and facilitate obtaining favorable terms from abroad.

(6) After the Corporation's credit is established abroad, it may negotiate with foreign countries to issue foreign currency industrial bonds in the foreign capital market if necessary.

(7) In order to meet the requirements of the industry for long-term domestic capital and to take into account the scarcity of domestic capital and the fact that the capital market has not yet been established, the Corporation may accept bonds issued by various factories according to their actual needs, or lend mid-term or long-term domestic currency funds with factory land and buildings as collateral. In addition to the Corporation's domestic currency capital, the source of lending funds may be borrowed from the National Bank and other shareholder banks and companies through bonds and other certificates.

If the above measures can be realized, the current difficulties in settling foreign exchange in the industry can be immediately resolved, and the institution for importing foreign investment can also be immediately established. At the same time, because the Corporation has strong financial resources, it can win foreign trust; because the authority is unified, it can strive for more favorable terms abroad; and because it can accept the bonds issued by factories and borrow from banks, the problem of raising long-term domestic currency funds can also be easily solved. According to this estimate, if managed properly, the capital of 500 million US dollars can guide at least 1.5 to 2 billion US dollars of long-term foreign investment to flow in. In this way, most of the foreign currency funds needed for initial construction can be resolved. The future of national construction deeply relies on it!

The Shanghai Branch of the New Life Movement Promotion Association invited Mayor Qian to broadcast to the citizens of the city on the Youth Radio last night at 7 pm on "Rectifying the Appearance of the City and Municipal Administration" for the 12th anniversary of the New Life Movement, saying: Rectifying the appearance of the city is an important task in the process of "organizing and building" municipal facilities. It is not only the preliminary stage of practicing the New Life Movement, but also the necessary procedure for municipal construction. While the government authorities must do their best to implement it, all citizens must also cooperate to know that the result of rectifying the appearance of the city can be used as a test of whether we are sincere in practicing the New Life Movement, and it is also from here that we can examine whether we can "understand propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, take responsibility, and abide by discipline" to be a modern national and build a modern country. I hope that all compatriots in the city will earnestly abide by it and implement it together to make Shanghai a tidy, clean, and beautiful city, on par with other major cities in the world, to demonstrate the spirit of Shanghai citizens of removing the old and establishing the new.

### ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENT GOING TO SCHOOL TO REGISTER DISAPPEARS, RESCUED IN SUZHOU, BANDITS DEMAND 15 GOLD BARS FOR RANSOM

(Our newspaper) Xu Huquan (working in the Military Commission) of No. 19 Yuanyuli, Delu, Shanghai West, has a son named Wenhua, 15 years old, who just returned to Shanghai from Chongqing. On the 9th of this month, a relative named Lu Shaokui came to deceive Wenhua and his sister Wenfang to register at Xuhui Public School in Xujiahui. When they arrived near the school, Lu said to Wenfang, please wait a moment, I'll be right back. Unexpectedly, Lu took Wenhua away and never returned. Wenfang had no choice but to return home. It wasn't until about 9 am the next morning that a phone call came, saying that Xu and Lu had been kidnapped, and please prepare a ransom, etc. Another phone call was made on the 12th, with roughly the same meaning. On the morning of the 15th, another phone call came, and both parties agreed to ransom the ticket for 15 gold bars and arranged to send someone to contact them at the Yaozhu Road tram stop in the afternoon. At 2 pm, the Xu family reported the information to the Jing'an Temple Branch. Chen Jinsheng, Guo Yuping, Han Yongchang and other staff members of the Judicial Section, together with his sister-in-law Tan Shiying and his sister Wenfang, went to the place at the appointed time. Not long after, they saw Lu Shaokui and Xie talking to Wenfang, etc., and they were all arrested and taken to the bureau for interrogation. According to the confession, the hostage was hidden in room 27 of the Xin Su Hotel in Suzhou. The original team took a military vehicle to Suzhou on the 15th and safely rescued the hostage and returned to Shanghai by car.

### PERSONNEL OF CRASHED AMERICAN AIRCRAFT HAVE NOT YET BEEN FOUND

(Our newspaper) On the 31st of last month, an American air transport plane flying from Jinan to Shanghai crashed due to mechanical failure while passing over Taicang. Six officers on board parachuted down to the Taicang area, and another five landed between Taicang and Liuhe. The American military authorities found a broken aircraft in Liuhe on February 1, but there has been no news for two weeks. It wasn't until 5 pm the day before yesterday (14th) that the American military authorities received a report from Chinese officials that American troops were found landing between Taicang and Kunshan on the 21st of last month. The American military authorities immediately sent personnel yesterday morning, and asked the liaison officer of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to go to the area for inspection. However, the investigation revealed that the landing aircraft reported by the Chinese was not the transport aircraft.

It was a coincidence that an American military aircraft flying out of Shanghai on the 31st of last month was forced to land over Taicang due to mechanical failure. It immediately telegraphed Shanghai to send a plane for assistance. I don't know if the second plane could not fly after landing, so the American authorities in Shanghai sent two more planes to repair it. After the repairs were completed, all four planes returned to Shanghai safely. This happened on the same day, so the Chinese report was misunderstood.

As for the eleven people who landed on the transport plane, there is still no news of them. According to the American military, they may have fallen into the Chinese communist area, and they are currently continuing to investigate everywhere.

### XU CHONGZHI ARRIVES IN SHANGHAI FROM GUANGDONG, WAS SECRETLY IMPRISONED BY THE ENEMY IN HONG KONG AND VOWED TO NEVER YIELD

(Our newspaper) Xu Chongzhi, a senior member of the Kuomintang and member of the Central Supervisory Committee, arrived in Shanghai from Guangdong the day before yesterday on a special plane sent by Chairman Jiang. When the Pacific War broke out, Xu was in Hong Kong and was secretly imprisoned by the enemy. He was determined not to waver, and the enemy could do nothing about it. After the victory, Xu returned to Guangzhou.

Chairman Jiang sent a telegram of condolence and sent a special plane to welcome him to Shanghai. He told this newspaper that he was very happy to be able to meet with compatriots and comrades in Shanghai this time. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, compatriots across the country went through hardships, and finally, due to the unified reception of the spirit of Chairman Jiang, they worked hard and achieved the final victory. Chairman Jiang's leadership in the Anti-Japanese War will be forever recorded in history. As for the allied countries, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, especially the United States, gave our country spiritual and material assistance, which is worthy of admiration. However, our country urgently needs to recuperate and revitalize itself after the war in order to recover its vitality. I deeply hope that all parties and factions will sacrifice their own small interests and take care of the overall interests, unite in spirit, and earnestly implement the Three People's Principles of the founding father of the country to build a country of the people, by the people, and for the people. I also have high expectations for the United Nations organization and sincerely hope that the world can achieve a comprehensive, peaceful, and bright path. In the remaining years of my life, I have dedicated myself to the revolution for decades. As long as I have a breath, I will not dare to slacken in the hope of contributing to my country's rejuvenation and world peace.

### Ammunition Explosion During Transport Causes Dozens of Casualties

[Report from Our Newspaper] At 10:30 last night, an explosion involving rifle grenades occurred at the Japanese-owned Gong He Xiang Wharf on Daming Road, Hongkou, Huaji Road. It originated when U.S. Landing Ship No. 1015, tasked with transporting the New Sixth Army to the Northeast, was designated as the Fourth Transport Ship for that army. Last night, as ammunition was being loaded using a crane to hoist artillery shells onto the ship, three rifle grenades slipped and fell into the vessel during the crane's rotation. This triggered an immediate explosion, producing three loud booms. Smoke and fire quickly filled the area. American military police on the shore, hearing the blasts, rushed onto the ship and discovered a hole in the hull, about the size of a washbasin. Soldiers and workers lay injured or dead within the cabin. The military police, along with soldiers and workers from the New Sixth Army, evacuated the wounded to the deck and summoned ambulances for emergency treatment at hospitals. Among those admitted to the Public Concession Hospital were over thirty artillery battalion and 207th Division soldiers, including Lü Piqian, Chen Yinsheng, Tao Xinde, Ma Tiancai, Liu Daxiang, Li Shuliang, Ma Hengfang, Wang Tingyun, Yi Qingmen, Cao Zuozhi, Yang Yucheng, Zhang Xingde, Ma Tianfu, Li Zhexuan, and five laborers, including Zhou Hua.

### Gold, Currency, and Securities: Black Market Discovered, Money Changers Watching

The [gold] ingots still did not have any public buying and selling yesterday. The black market was sustained by both buyers and sellers transacting privately. The reported price of gold notes in the wartime capital of Chongqing was rising, and some were taking advantage of the lower prices to buy, while Sichuan traders were also making up for losses. Initially, the price was between 1.45 million and 1.50 million, then briefly rose to over 1.53 million. Yesterday, money changers also dared not continue operations. Overnight transactions made on the afternoon of the 14th were set to be settled immediately. Sellers, due to tight cash flow, secretly increased the overnight borrowing rate to 25%. This caused panic among the buyers, and selling pressure increased. Gradually, the price receded to below 1.4 million. At this time, employees of the National Bank were engaged in a work slowdown, making deposits and withdrawals inconvenient, which also had a significant impact. The price hit a low of 1.38 million before stabilizing slightly, fluctuating around 1.43 million in the afternoon. No official price for decorative gold was listed. There were rumors that silver shops might resume operations on Monday. Fine silver was priced at 1,600 [yuan], and silver ingots fluctuated between 790 and 840 yuan. Due to settlement activities among traders and high demand for cash, the overnight lending rate rose to between 20% and 25%. Banks were affected by the Four Banks and were reluctant to allow withdrawals.

The foreign currency market was even more subdued yesterday. Money changers, fearing investigations by the authorities, almost entirely refrained from trading. On the black market, U.S. dollars initially traded at 2,000 to 2,050 yuan, peaked at 2,050 to 2,080 yuan, and then fell back to 1,980 to 2,000 yuan before finally settling at 2,000 to 2,030 yuan. Hong Kong dollars were slightly weaker because news from Hong Kong indicated that the national currency was quoted at 39 (equivalent to over 256 Hong Kong dollars), with a remittance rate of 80%, roughly equivalent to 320 yuan in Shanghai. As a result, old Hong Kong dollar notes were priced at around 240 yuan, while Hong Kong telegrams, due to demand from cotton yarn traders, were priced at around 305 yuan. New Hong Kong dollar notes attracted little attention.

There was some buying and selling of Class C government bonds, with prices around 1,650 yuan. There was also some interest in local stocks at lower prices on the black market. Yong Yarn traded at around 2,000 to 2,100 yuan, Mei Ya at 1,500 to 1,600 yuan, Jingfu at 100 to 110 yuan, Xinguang at 92 to 95 yuan, and Qinxing at 80 to 85 yuan. Foreign stocks remained quiet.

### Rice and Flour Prices Rise Again

Yesterday's rice market saw shops selling off their stock, with most transactions being retail sales. Prices rebounded by 400 to 500 yuan. Flour prices also increased by 200 to 300 yuan. Soybeans were firm, and high-quality raw peanuts saw price increases, while medium and lower grades remained stable. Soybean cakes increased by over 100 yuan, and wheat bran remained unchanged. Crude oil prices rose by 1,000 yuan, while soybean oil was stable. The prices of various grains fluctuated, showing a wavering pattern.

### Yarn Prices Rise Slightly, Cotton Cloth Market Dull

Yesterday's yarn market saw ups and downs. In the morning, buoyed by the rebound from the previous day, prices jumped by 80,000 yuan. 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn was quoted at 1 million yuan again. However, due to extremely tight credit conditions and a strong desire to sell among small traders, prices gradually declined, closing at a low of 920,000 yuan for the day. Trading volume was light overall. Traders from Nanjing and inland areas showed slight interest in smaller quantities of 20-count yarn. Overall, closing prices were only slightly higher, by about 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, compared to the previous day.

The cotton cloth market was even more dull due to the Saturday factor. Both manufacturers and traders adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Only the Textile Construction Company purchased 32-count raw materials. Fine villus cotton from San Yu Town was priced at 92,000 yuan, delivered to the factory. Other factories did not conduct any transactions.

Customer demand for cotton cloth has temporarily ceased, causing prices to decline. However, dyeing and weaving factories are facing increasing fuel costs and want to increase sales prices, but market demand is lacking. They are forced to lower prices to maintain profitability, creating a difficult situation. The supply of gray cloth has recently loosened, so many dyeing and weaving factories are reportedly starting operations. It is also reported that the China Textile Construction Company only sold hemp and wool miscellaneous items yesterday.

### American Fruit Arrives in Shanghai

The supply of American fruit was cut off after the Japanese invasion of the South, lasting for over six years. It is now learned that the American President Lines ship "Grant" arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, carrying oranges and lemons totaling 4,200 boxes, shipped from San Francisco. This is the first shipment of fruit to arrive in Shanghai since the end of the war.

### U.S. Needs Raw Silk

According to Associated Press, the United States is currently experiencing a severe shortage of silk stockings and urgently needs 10,000 bales of silk to manufacture 20 million pairs of silk stockings to meet market demand. Stocking manufacturers have requested the government to immediately import silk from Japan to alleviate the shortage of raw materials for stocking production.

### Coal Market's Rising Trend Declines

The coal market has seen intense price increases in recent days. Some speculation is inevitable, and sellers believe that the price increase has reached saturation. It's an opportune time to sell. Furthermore, the authorities are cracking down on speculation, making people nervous. Therefore, sales of white coal lumps and other slow-moving items have seen price declines. Demand for bituminous coal dust from factories remains strong, with continued progress. The supply of charcoal is steady, and prices are stable. The supply of firewood from production areas is tight, and prices are rising. In particular, the supply of miscellaneous firewood and chestnut firewood to Shanghai is limited, causing significant price increases.

### Commercial News Agency to Increase Subscribers Starting Tomorrow

The local Commercial News Agency was established in 1937. After the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, the Central Propaganda Department approved its news releases. The agency has updated its content, focusing on covering news from the industrial and commercial sectors and market conditions in various industries. In addition to the original major newspapers, it will also increase direct subscribers starting tomorrow (the 18th). The news will be delivered by special messenger before 4 p.m. daily.

### Briefs

Xiaoguang Middle School, located at the intersection of Dianfei Road and Masnan Road in this city, is continuing to recruit new students. Registration will be held on the 19th and 20th, examinations on the 22nd, and classes will officially begin on the 25th.

Lianhua Commercial Tutoring School in this city is adding a weekly lecture series this semester, featuring renowned professors Zhang Yifan, Jiang Chouyu, Tang Tao, and Jiang Liquan. A second branch has also been added on Baker Road, scheduled to open on the 25th.

The leasing of the remaining rooms in the municipal stadium and the collection of transfer fees has drawn much criticism of Wang Fudan. It is understood that Wang Fudan was originally an inspector at the Bureau of Education and that the stadium was a side job. However, after the case of illegally occupying enemy assets occurred, Director Gu of the Bureau of Education felt that although Wang had shifted the blame to his wife and was able to be released on bail, it had still tarnished his official reputation. Therefore, he subtly dismissed him from the position of inspector and transferred him to the position of commissioner of the bureau. Shao Ruji has already taken over and is performing his duties.

The Women's Movement Committee of the Municipal Party Headquarters is sponsoring a women's tutoring school. Recently, a fifth branch was added within the Zhonghua Elementary and Middle School at the intersection of Qipu Road, North Zhejiang Road, and West China. The subjects are comprehensive and the fees are low. Those interested in enrolling can go to register.

President Zhang Yi of the Chongqing campus of Fudan University in this city will come to Shanghai at the end of the month to preside over the reopening. The next semester is scheduled to begin on February 18th, with registration on the 26th.

Special Issue on Production and Construction

### Important Steps in Production and Construction: Talent Cooperation

We routinely interact with the general industrial sector, and most people feel that the lack of talent has become a rather serious problem. Because for construction, talent must come first. Without talent, all good plans cannot be implemented.

Originally, there were many instances in our country of people not using what they had learned. The work they were engaged in was fundamentally not what they had previously studied or researched. During the War of Resistance, due to unstable living conditions, many people had to change careers. Thus, excellent specialized talents became ordinary merchants. When victory arrived and it was time to begin construction, there was a lack of talent to meet the current needs.

Many factories, in the early stages of the War of Resistance, relocated inland. When the War of Resistance ended and they hoped to rebuild in Shanghai, they not only lacked the economic strength, but also the sufficient talent to undertake the work of revitalization.

The cultivation of specialized talent is not something that can be achieved in a day. A well-rounded talent must possess both knowledge and experience. Therefore, losing a talent is equivalent to losing a significant asset.

From now on, in addition to intensifying the training of talent, we must also prevent existing talent from changing careers. The completion of this task requires a two-pronged approach: on the one hand, the industrial sector must find ways to stabilize the lives of specialized talent, enabling them to work with peace of mind and strive for progress; at the same time, employees must also understand that frequent career changes can only address the present. While the realization of this is also not to be neglected, it will not yield good results. Both sides should adopt close cooperation and consider the overall enterprise, because the success of future production and construction, in addition to economic conditions, can be said to depend primarily on the success of talent cooperation.

### Labor-Management Cooperation in England

— Qing He

In order to understand the economic situation in England, I made a special trip there to investigate. What I discovered was that there was no sign of economic recession in the English industrial sector. Labor and management were able to cooperate thoroughly, making their industry active and full of vitality. English industrialists are also rallying their spirits to reorganize their businesses meticulously. From the beginning, labor and management used negotiation to resolve issues such as working hours and wages, from coal mines, agriculture, cotton industry, and construction to all small-scale enterprises. Obsolete union methods were uniformly corrected. Some regulations established during the war, although still applied, were improved to adapt to the environment of the construction era. In the committees jointly formed by labor and management in five thousand factories, the combination of technical skills on the labor side and managerial skills on the management side produced great results.

They believe that the greatest goal is to improve the living standards of the British people. This goal is more important than any doctrine. Therefore, all bad old habits must be eliminated and situations that undermine work efficiency must be improved in order to produce the maximum possible output.

No one is more studied in British labor issues than Herbert Morrison, a Labor Party member of Parliament in the House of Commons. He said: "What our country needs is more national revenue to ensure that all workers have jobs. We must have huge exports and scientifically sound production. As long as we work hard, we can definitely achieve our goals. We must never think of ourselves, nor seek the satisfaction of only individuals or a party. If it should be state-owned, then it must be managed by the state; if it is suitable for private ownership, then it may as well be managed by the public."

Another leader of a labor group once said: "Although defeating capitalists can bring temporary pleasure, it is detrimental to the entire industry and to the production mechanism. In order to meet the production needs after the war, we must make both sides cooperate."

During World War II, British workers worked longer hours and in less favorable environments than during World War I, but the man-hours lost due to strikes were only one-fifth of those lost during World War I. This does not mean that workers have stopped demanding improved treatment, but that they have understood their responsibilities. They want to preserve the industrial goose so that it can lay many, many eggs.

Currently, the British labor organization is stronger than any other industrialized country, but they do not force every worker to join a union. The progress of British industry is due to two reasons: first, "initiative," and second, "mutual trust." Whether it is the labor side or the management side, they are able to consider the entire enterprise. I can cite two examples to illustrate this:

A director of a car manufacturing plant said: "In the past, we adopted a top-down management method, but currently, this method is no longer feasible." Because he has abandoned the method of exclusive control by the management. I visited a factory in Manchester, where the workers told me that in the past, each worker managed one locomotive. People automatically planned methods to save resources. Now, one worker can manage three locomotives, so production has greatly increased. British workers understand very well that if they want to get more income and enjoy a better life, they must first enable British industry to obtain more business.

British industrialist Cordard said: "British labor-management cooperation adopts a moderate approach to maximize efficiency. This awakening can be said to be a great achievement since the beginning of the mechanical age, and the future shows unlimited promise."

### The Neglected Handkerchief Manufacturing Industry

— Yao Yinwei

Occupies an Important Position in the Weaving Industry

Of the necessities of life, clothing occupies a large part, but items such as handkerchiefs and socks are also indispensable. Everyone has a handkerchief, and its importance is no different from a pair of socks for each foot.

In the early years of the Republic of China, white and blue checkered silk handkerchiefs were popular, produced in Shengze. But at that time, people did not pay much attention to hygiene and lived simply, so most people overlooked and did not prepare them. Later, white gauze handkerchiefs from the East and the West, with beautiful colors, such as the British-made Tower Brand Pyramidn, Ideal, Colorbide, and the Czech-made Three Flower Brand Miracle, flooded the market and dominated it for more than ten years, earning countless money. Although there were domestic products at the time, they were very simple, just buying cloth, cutting, sewing, and that was it. Later, they were improved to print flowers on white cloth, and then further improved to dye the yarn into various colors to weave handkerchiefs. This was of course much more advanced than printing flowers. But compared to foreign goods, it was still far behind. Later, the dyeing and weaving industry rose, gradually making progress, which can be said to be the nascent stage of the handkerchief industry. When the European War broke out, foreign goods gradually disappeared. Seeing that the opportunity to promote domestic goods had arrived, I took on the arduous task of establishing the Huanqiu Handkerchief Weaving Factory, with the aim of eliminating the crude and preserving the essential, being original, striving for glory for domestic goods, and competing with foreign goods. The first products to be released were the 100-count linen yarn Huanqiu Brand woven floral satin striped handkerchiefs and Safety Brand satin striped handkerchiefs. Then, double-sided satin striped handkerchiefs were created. These handkerchiefs have satin stripes and delicate patterns on both the front and back, so they not only rivaled imported goods, but even surpassed them. Therefore, they sold well in various places, and the products became widely known. In the 31st year of the Republic of China, I felt that gifts for weddings, birthdays, and openings cost a lot of money and iron every year, so I studied diligently and invented the handkerchief flower basket in the autumn of that year, which caused a sensation. It was generally said to be beautiful and practical. Therefore, handkerchiefs had another outlet, and the number of fellow traders gradually increased. Up to now, there are more than ninety handkerchief traders. Daily production is increasing day by day. But the times are constantly progressing, and people's desires for material enjoyment and knowledge are also increasing day by day. Handkerchiefs are not only for practical use, but have also progressed to possessing decorative value. Therefore, the quality must be perfect, and the color is even more important.

Now the War of Resistance has been won, and industrial production is the most important core of national construction. Those engaged in industry should bury themselves in hard work and strive for construction. The leader urged: "The purpose of life is to improve the lives of all mankind, and the meaning of life is to create the life that succeeds the universe." It can indeed be taken as a goal to strive for. It is hoped that fellow traders will gradually improve the rudimentary mechanical equipment so that foreign goods cannot come and compete with us again. Furthermore, we must sell to foreign countries, compete in the global market, and encourage everyone to use domestic goods, reducing the number of outflows of money. The Father of the Nation declared: "We should use our decades of mortal life to lay the unshakable foundation of the nation for billions of years." I believe that production must be increased, and shoddy manufacturing is not allowed; construction must be successful, and failure is not allowed.

### The Realistic Problems of Industrial Recovery

— Luo Liqun

Because of our country's backward production, large-scale industries, apart from those established by foreign businesses, are really scarce. The basic organization of all industrial production is supported by small and medium-sized factories. However, because of their weak capital, in addition to the necessary production equipment, the only financial resources they usually use are loans from money houses and credit debts between various industries to maintain and inject funds. However, because there are many small and medium-sized factories, and at the same time they can bury themselves in hard work, their contribution to the entire production mechanism is quite great.

But since the Japanese invaders occupied our country, after eight years of control and buying by the enemy and puppets, the originally weak small and medium-sized factories could not withstand the ravages of the fierce waves and were already exhausted. Although the War of Resistance has now been won and industrial recovery must be implemented, the capital reserves of small and medium-sized factories have been reduced to mere shells after being looted by the enemy and puppets. They are currently suppressed by high prices, making it very difficult to recover.

Therefore, the current realistic problem of industrial recovery is how to enable small and medium-sized factories to quickly resume operations, and how to enable them to develop and have large-scale production.

What is most needed now is economic assistance, because huge loans are not easy to obtain at present, and the habit of credit debt has also been broken. It is sincerely hoped that the government can consider this and quickly formulate a broad factory loan plan, so that small and medium-sized factories that have not started work can start as soon as possible, and those that are already producing can increase production. Then industrial recovery will not only be a pleasant slogan, but can become a reality.

### Coping with Difficulties

— Chuan Liangjun

Xinguang Standard Underwear Dyeing, Weaving, and Finishing Factory has developed rapidly in recent years. Mr. Chuan Liangjun, the founder, has unique ways of handling various affairs. We have specially asked him to publish some of his insights on business management. This manuscript is beneficial for readers to learn from. — Editor

In the operation of any business, it is inevitable to encounter various difficulties. When encountering difficulties, one must calmly cope with them in order to overcome them and step into the stage of progress.

Taking Xinguang Standard Underwear Dyeing, Weaving, and Finishing Factory as an example, since its establishment to the present, it has encountered many difficulties, such as the interruption of transportation and the purchase of cotton cloth. These could have made Xinguang's past achievements come to naught. Fortunately, when difficulties arose, we used our best efforts to overcome them, and instead gained opportunities for progress.

The difficulties that will be encountered in the future will certainly be quite numerous, so we must always be prepared for the arrival of difficulties and find ways to cope with them.

To overcome difficulties, it is very important to focus all your attention on the business, because only when a person's energy is focused on one business can they have the strength to cope.

### Good News for the Silk Industry

Before the Incident, most of our country's silk machinery was imported from Japan, and very little was made by Chinese people. After eight years of war, all silk factories in the sericulture area were almost completely destroyed. Although the government has been doing its best to revitalize the sericulture industry in order to develop silk exports, silk factories often suffer from the difficulty of not being able to procure machinery. Recently, it has been heard that Xu Tongzhao, Kong Haozhuang, and others, in response to the needs of the silk industry, purchased new-style machinery and established Tailai Iron Factory at No. 22, Lane 296, Bailinan Road, Shanghai. In addition to specializing in精 silk machinery, they also painstakingly research and manufacture machinery for silk reeling, silk weaving, spinning, weaving, tea making, etc., and provide planning for the complete equipment of various factories.

### State-Run Light Industry: China Textile Construction Company

— Yi

Since its establishment, China Textile Construction Company has rapidly advanced its business and occupies a leading position in production and construction. In order to give all sectors of society a deeper understanding of the company, we interviewed Mr. Shu Yunzhang, the general manager of the company, and he provided various relevant materials.

China Textile Construction Company is a state-run light industry that can be divided into the following aspects.

Organizational Aspect

According to Article 1 of the company's articles of association, the company is organized in accordance with Article 8 of the Regulations on the Organization of the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and is named China Textile Construction Company, translated into English as China Textile Industries Inc. The total capital, in addition to the assets of enemy and puppet yarn factories taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs at an estimated price, plus 1 billion yuan in national currency, is allocated in one lump sum by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The selection of directors and supervisors is proposed by the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and approved by the Executive Yuan as follows: Vice President Weng will serve as chairman, and Shu Yunzhang, Li Shengbo, Wu Weijing, Yang Xiren, and Wang Yangxian, members of the Textile Management Committee, are designated as directors, and Zhang Zige and Wang Zijian are designated as supervisors. The head office is located at No. 138 Jiangxi Road, Shanghai, with branch offices in Tianjin and Qingdao.

Under the general manager, there are five departments: engineering, business, accounting, auditing, and secretarial. Among them, each of the four departments of engineering, business, accounting, and secretarial has one department head and one deputy department head. The auditing department has one chief auditor and one deputy chief auditor, all of whom are appointed by the board of directors upon the proposal of the general manager.

Current Progress

According to the company's articles of association, the scope of business is stipulated as follows:

(1) Manufacture and dyeing and finishing of textiles

(2) Purchase and sale of textile dyeing raw materials and finished products

(3) Manufacture and purchase and sale of textile dyeing machinery and parts

(4) Operation of matters related to the preceding three businesses

(5) Investment in other textile dyeing and finishing related businesses

As of now, the exact number of enemy and puppet textile factories taken over by the company is:

(1) Yarn factories: 19

(2) Wool spinning factories: 6 units

(3) Printing and dyeing factories: 6 units

(4) 製 factories: 2 units

(5) Silk spinning factories: 1 unit

(6) Machine factories: 1 unit

Among the yarn factories, except for three that have not started work due to excessive damage to machinery and buildings, the remaining sixteen have already started production. Among them, Neiwai No. 9 Factory and Dakang No. 2 Factory have started to work day and night shifts. In the shortest possible time, preparations are being made to fully open day and night shifts, so that the quantity of production can be doubled. As for the current production, it has exceeded 400,000 spindles, and it is expected that it can be expanded to more than 500,000 spindles within a month.

Employed Workers

As of now, the workers prepared for use in yarn factories total 4,042 male workers and 8,302 female workers. In wool spinning factories, there are a total of 530 male workers and 980 female workers. In printing and dyeing factories, there are a total of 723 male and female workers.

The working time for each shift per day is ten hours. If day and night shifts are opened, then it will work for a total of twenty hours.

Market Price Problem

Currently, because the source of raw materials is not yet smooth, the amount of production cannot be increased quickly. Recently, many people have advocated the complete use of domestic cotton, but based on the calculation of all four million yarn spindles in China being fully opened, each spindle needs two and a half dan of raw cotton per year, which would require a total of more than ten million dan of raw cotton. It is estimated that this year's national cotton production is less than five million dan. Because of transportation relations, it is feared that the actual cotton that can be supplied to yarn factories for production will be less than two million dan. Therefore, it is quite difficult to enable all spindles to be fully opened. Because the output is limited and the demand is high, especially when the price of gold skyrocketed a few days ago, the price of yarn rose accordingly. The company used its best efforts to seek peace, and only opened the price at the appropriate time (one or two hours later than the market price), so that speculators could not profit from it, and at the same time, it could stop the rising wind (for a few days, because the market price rose sharply, the company's price was too far apart, and there was a danger of being used by speculators. If it did not sell at all, it would only make the rising wind worse. Therefore, in order to take full account of reality, it had to increase the price, but it still had a considerable distance from the market price (but because of the output and the impact of the price of gold, the expected effect could not be achieved, but the company has done its best).

Future Policy

The future policy is that in order to prevent hoarding and encourage production of yarn and cloth, a large amount of barrel yarn is specially sold and directly allocated to various factories. In terms of sales, since it can supply real sales users, and in terms of market price, it can also have more control opportunities.

In terms of operation, in addition to the lack of raw materials, the lack of skilled workers is also a very serious problem, because a skilled worker needs at least three months of training time, so the company is cultivating a large number of skilled laborers in the process of production.

Burying Head in Hard Work

China Textile Construction Company is not as simple as an ordinary factory, because it takes over many factories at the same time, so the operation is quite heavy. Mr. Shu Yunzhang, the general manager of the company, pays attention to practice, does not advocate empty talk, and buries his head in hard work. In the future, he will definitely be able to move forward under circumstances where the environment permits.

### Major Increase in Production in the American Industrial Sector in 1946

— Wen

At the beginning of 1946, the American industrial sector had an air of progressing into a prosperous era. Every person had greater purchasing power, and even those more conservative people were prepared to buy more things. In the past, American automobile manufacturers manufactured at most five million cars a year, but in 1946, they prepared to increase to six million cars.

Washing machine manufacturers produced at most 1.9 million units per year, and in 1946, the planned target was 2.5 million units. This increase in production was common to every industry, from clothing to soap powder, all preparing for mass production. (Recorded from the January 7th issue of Time magazine this year)
