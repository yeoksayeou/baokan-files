[Another Telegram] The National Assembly's "Meeting of Social Elites" hosted the press this afternoon, requesting that the constitution grant a reasonable status to the Manchu compatriots, advocating for: (1) adding a new item to Article 26: "Representatives elected by Manchu nationals residing in the country," (2) adding a fourth item to Articles 65 and 96: "Twenty Manchu nationals residing in the country," (3) adding the phrase "provincial Manchu councilors, elected by the Manchu people" to Article 115, paragraph 1.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 7th] Three Mongolian groups in this city hosted Beiping reporters, firmly advocating the addition of a special chapter to the constitution to protect the ethnic status and stipulate autonomous rights. The three groups are the Mongolian Beiping Compatriot Association, the Mongolian Youth Aspiration Society, and the Mongolian Beiping Student Association. Chen Shaowu spoke on behalf of the groups, emphasizing that the Mongolian compatriots only recognize their position as a component of the Republic of China, supporting the current central government's supreme leader, and expressing indifference to the current party disputes. He also emphasized that to build a strong national defense, it is necessary to value the status of various ethnic groups surrounding the national border. Chen specifically pointed out that the Inner Mongolia issue is a national issue, not a local issue. Mongolians demand a high degree of autonomy, not local autonomy; Mongolians seek unified autonomy, not regional autonomy; Mongolians seek not to secede from the country, but to secede from the province.

### First Draft Constitution Review Committee Holds Special Discussion on Preamble to Draft Constitution

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The first review committee held a meeting at the Central Party Headquarters at 3:30 PM on the 7th to continue special discussion on the "Preamble" of the draft constitution. Representatives Zou Lu, Di Ying, Zhang Zhiben, and two hundred and forty-four others attended. Ren Zhuoxuan chaired the meeting. After the meeting began, the representatives first designated one or two groups to join for group review: (1) Preamble and General Principles, (2) People's Rights and Duties, (3) Election and other articles. When the representatives discussed the "Preamble," their remarks were enthusiastic. Representatives from the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party also expressed their opinions. More than ten female representatives also spoke, and the situation was quite lively. Finally, it was decided to organize the opinions discussed today and the two proposals submitted by the representatives, and submit them to the first group for detailed review. The meeting was scheduled to continue on the 9th. After the meeting started today, Huang Shaogu first reported the results of the conveners' consultations, saying that the first review committee was ranked first among the various review committees, and that the results of this committee's review would be discussed first when the comprehensive committee meets in the future, so it can be said to be "bearing the brunt." At the same time, the review date has been limited to six days, so it seems necessary to speed up the process. Although the proposals have not all been printed, we can proceed with grouping and start special discussions on the "Preamble," which may be beneficial to the review process. After the speech, Jiang Wanping and others spoke, advocating for speeding up the review and hoping to avoid such chaos every day. Then, the representatives spoke on the "Preamble." Zou Zhifen stated that the amendment's preamble, "The National Assembly of the Republic of China, entrusted by all the people, based on the teachings of Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China..." does not include all of the teachings of the founding father, and is not as good as the draft constitution of 1946. He advocated changing it to "based on the teachings of Sun Yat-sen, who created the Republic of China." Kuomintang representative Yuan Shibin expressed opposition, believing that such a change would make "Sun Yat-sen's teachings" broader in meaning. The Premier's teachings also involve personal private life, so should that be included in the constitution? The hall burst into laughter after his remarks. Jiang Wanping, a representative of freelance professions, opposed listing the teachings one by one, believing that this would be like cutting the feet to fit the shoes, and that it would be more solemn to remove the phrase "to consolidate national power." At this point, Min Da, a representative of the Youth Party, stood up and said, "As a member of the Youth Party, I would like to make a statement from the party's perspective. This draft constitution was drafted by our Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and other four parties, and submitted to the congress by the government. I support it as usual, and I am not complacent. I express my support for the amendment proposed by Representative Hu Guowei." Wang Bingjun said: The four words "永矢咸遵" (yong shi xian zun, forever pledged to abide by) are not as good as "咸矢永遵" (xian shi yong zun, pledged to abide forever). Chen Tingrui, from a legal perspective, believed that the word "本" (ben, this) in "制定本宪法" (zhiding ben xianfa, to enact this constitution) was inappropriate, because if there is "本" (ben, this) constitution, then there must be a "他" (ta, other) constitution, and suggested changing it to "制兹宪法" (zhi zi xianfa, to enact this constitution) to avoid ambiguous wording. Li Jianfu agreed to maintain the original proposal, saying that "依据" (yiju, based on) does not mean "respect," but contains the meaning of equality. If it is changed to "遵照" (zun zhao, to follow), it would violate the teachings and have a demeaning implication of unequal class. He also said that Chairman Chiang is the most faithful follower of Premier Sun, and he himself proposed it in this way, so we don't need to change it without authorization. Another representative held a different view, believing that the words "遵照" (zun zhao, to follow) are equally equal and democratic, and that "遵" (zun, to follow) means moving forward on the road, without any meaning of inequality. Jiang Wanping believed that such word-by-word comparisons were too pedantic, and proposed a compromise solution, changing "依据" (yiju, based on) and "遵照" (zun zhao, to follow) to "依照" (yizhao, according to). Xiao Yishan, a representative from Beiping, believed that "依据" (yiju, based on) does not have the meaning of "from above to below," and the words "遵照" (zun zhao, to follow) become the tone of voice from above to below in sentences such as "仰即遵照" (yang ji zun zhao, respectfully follow). Regarding the phrase "遗教" (yi jiao, teachings), he advocated adding the six characters "创造中华民国" (chuangzao zhonghua minguo, created the Republic of China) above the five characters "孙中山先生" (Sun Yat-sen), replacing the addition of "国父" (guofu, founding father) advocated by some people. Regarding whether to modify "永矢咸遵" (yong shi xian zun, forever pledged to abide by), he advocated maintaining the original proposal, saying that "永矢" (yong shi, forever pledge) means forever abiding in the heart, while "永遵" (yong zun, forever abide) means that we can never change, while some articles of the constitution can be amended according to law. Then representatives such as Zou Lu also stood up to speak, strongly advocating maintaining the original proposal. Finally, Luo Jingxuan, a female representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, said that this article, "to consolidate national power" and other sentences, fully includes the meaning of nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood, which is very good. Luo was the only speaker from the Democratic Socialist Party today, and everyone applauded after her speech. The meeting adjourned at about 5:00 PM. After the meeting, conveners Zhang Zhiben, Huang Shaogu, and others continued their consultations.

### Second Review Committee Conveners' Meeting

Full Review Committee to Meet Tomorrow

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The conveners of the second review committee held their second meeting at the second lounge of the National Assembly at 3:30 PM on the 7th. Lin Bin, Yi Weijing, Zhu Hongru, Zhang Qiang, Zeng Jikuan and other five people attended, and decided on four matters: (1) The review work will be temporarily based on the 100 proposals sent by the Assembly Secretariat. The secretariat of the Review Committee will organize the matters, select and number them, and send them to each convener for individual review before the conveners' meeting. After the meeting is summarized, they will be submitted to the Review Committee point by point. (2) The division of review groups is tentatively decided in principle, divided into: A. Election and powers of the National Assembly. B. Term and sessions of the National Assembly. C. Implementation and amendment of the constitution. Representatives are free to participate, but whether this point and the fundamental question of whether to divide into groups still need to be decided by the Review Committee. (3) Preparations for the election of two representatives to participate in the comprehensive review committee will be held at 2:00 PM on the 8th and 9th respectively for the third and fourth meetings. The second meeting of the Review Committee is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the 9th. The meeting proceeded until 4:20 PM when Shao Lizi arrived. Lin Bin reported the decision of the meeting to him and firmly requested Shao to attend and preside over the Review Committee on the 9th. The meeting adjourned at 4:35 PM.

### Joint Army and Air Force Exercise: Ministry of National Defense Invites National Assembly Representatives to Observe Today; General Tang Enbo Serves as Commander

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The Ministry of National Defense has scheduled a large-scale joint army and air force exercise for 9:00 AM on the 8th. Minister Bai and Chief of Staff Chen have invited National Assembly representatives to observe. The exercise program is divided into three items: army coordination with artillery, coordination with paratroopers, and landing behind enemy lines to attack enemy airfields.

The outer perimeter of the guard force will be staffed by the 59th Company, the inner guard will be staffed by the 2nd Military Police Regiment, and the shooting range will be staffed by the 2nd Guards Regiment. A picnic will also be held that day.

### Sixth Review Committee Reviews Provincial and County System

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The Sixth Review Committee was held at the second reception center for National Assembly representatives at 9:30 AM on the 7th, chaired by convener Zhang Bolun, to review the part related to the provincial and county system. It collected concrete opinions from the representatives and adjourned at 12:00 PM. Those who spoke included Li Yu, Zhang Jiyan, Zhong Boyi, Zhang Jiuru, Zhang Wei, Wu Tianchi, Zhang Xizhi, Zheng Shaozong, and Jiang Xuezhu. The main points of each representative's speech are recorded as follows:

Li Yu: (1) Article 114 states that the provincial people's representative congress is the organization for formulating provincial autonomy laws, while Article 115 states that the provincial legislative power is exercised by the provincial council. This is a duplication. Therefore, the provincial people's representative congress should be changed to the provincial public opinion organ. (2) The provisions of Article 115, Paragraph 4 stipulate that the county implements county autonomy and the county chief is popularly elected, while Article 125 states that the county establishes a county government with a county chief elected by the county people, which seems to be repetitive. (3) Article 115, Paragraph 5 describes the relationship between provinces and counties. The word "relationship" seems to be too general and should be clearly defined. (4) Article 118 states that "provincial laws that conflict with national laws and regulations are invalid," and Article 124 states that "county single regulations that conflict with central laws or provincial regulations are invalid." "National laws and regulations" and "central laws" are obviously the same thing, and the names should be unified and corrected. (5) Article 127, "The provisions of the county shall apply mutatis mutandis to cities" does not need to be specified in a separate article, because cities and counties are equal. Specifying the name of the city separately seems to be an overemphasis.

Zhang Jiyan: There are too many levels between the central government and local governments. I believe that: (1) The "province" system should be abolished. (2) The local system should be unified as "county" and the area of the county should be expanded.

Zhong Boyi: The two issues of the provincial and county system and the powers of the central and local governments are often difficult to divide. I have three points of view: (1) The status of the province should be clearly recognized from beginning to end. (2) The relationship between the province and the county. (3) The relationship between the province and the center. The following is a description: The status of the province is different from the federal system of other countries, because our country is too large and has a large population. The provincial district system has evolved from history. We should not recognize it as a purely national administrative region, but rather as a local autonomous entity. The powers of the province should also be formulated. This is an expression of the national father's theory of balanced power. Some people believe that the point of the provincial autonomy law has the suspicion of being divided. I don't think so because: (1) The provincial autonomy law is formulated by the central government. (2) After the formulation, it must be sent to the Judicial Yuan for review. If it hinders the national constitution, it will be declared invalid. (3) There are a total of ten provisions for the four powers of the province. The central government controls the local area and has many weapons. It cannot be divided or expanded. Therefore, the four powers should be expanded. Secondly, the status of the county is very important. It should be recognized as a local autonomous unit. In this draft, there are no regulations for county finance and national taxes. The section on the county is too general. I advocate that the province and county autonomy regulations should be formulated by the province, and the province and county finances and national taxes should be divided in the province's legislation.

Zhang Jiuru: The county should be given the power to develop self-irrigated autonomy. Looking at this draft, everything is placed on the provincial organs, which is suspected of exploiting county autonomy.

Zhang Wei: The provincial and county autonomy system should be stipulated by the central government. All principles of autonomy should be stipulated in the constitution, and there is no need to separately stipulate provincial autonomy laws. The province implements the provincial autonomy law, and implements the central government's commissioned matters and supervises the jurisdiction. The county implements county autonomy and the central and provincial commissioned matters. Also, if the provincial and county chiefs are popularly elected, the provincial and county council should also have the power to impeach the provincial and county chiefs.

Wu Tianchi: The national father's theory of balanced power means that the central government cannot be over-centralized. The drawbacks of centralization are very great, so it should be corrected. The federal system of the United States has too much centrifugal force, so it is combined with the federal system. China has too much centripetal force, so the province and county should be given considerable freedom of autonomy.

Zhang Xizhi: (1) There are only eight articles in the section on the provincial and county system, while there are fourteen articles in the province. This seems too little, because autonomy is in the local area, not in the central government, at the grassroots level and not in the central government. According to the founding program, the status of the province is an administrative region between the central government and the local government, implementing the matters commissioned by the central government and supervising the county matters. This kind of power is completely different from the draft constitution of 1946, but I strongly agree with it. (2) The autonomy law is formulated by the province. There are simple regulations in the section on the county. This point may lead to provincial autonomy, because the autonomous unit should still be the county, and not the province. (3) Article 114 stipulates that there are two legislative institutions in the province, the provincial people's representative congress and the provincial council, which seems to be repetitive. One of them should be abolished, and the provincial people's representative congress should be retained. The central government has the National Assembly, the province has the provincial people's representative congress, and the county has the county people's congress. The powers of the provincial people's representative congress should also be stipulated. (4) Article 115, Paragraph 4 states that the county implements county autonomy, and Article 123 states that the county establishes a county council, etc., which are all repetitive.

Jiang Xuezhu: Some people believe that the provincial area should be reduced. If the provincial area is small, it can prevent the malpractice of local separatism. In fact, the formation of separatism in the past had a problem, which was due to the military power issue. I believe that the nationalization of the army must be absolute, and the division of military power and political power will naturally eliminate the malpractice of separatism.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 7th] The national army's Meng and various blockhouses in the suburbs of Zhongyang City have been almost completely destroyed as of the 7th, and the communist army continues to reinforce. On the night of the 7th, they fiercely attacked the large blockhouses of Nanshan and Nanhetan. The battle was fierce. The communist army has besieged Zaozhuang in the northeast of the city and Sanliwan in the west of the city for five days and nights, and is still being firmly defended by the national army.

[Central News Agency, Datong, 6th] The communist army of Chen Zhengxiang, who is entrenched in southern Chahar, suddenly surrounded the national army stationed in Dongjijing (20 kilometers west of Yangyuan) with all its forces on the morning of the 3rd, and cut off the traffic between Yangyuan and Dongjijing with a small force. After a day and night of fierce fighting, on the morning of the 4th, the communist army sent a large number of reinforcements and fiercely attacked Chugu Ding (10 kilometers south of Yangyuan). The situation at that time was very serious. After the defending army resisted bravely, it finally completely defeated the invading communist army, and its remnants fled in the direction of Guangling.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 7th] The communist army's New Fourth Army's 1st Division and the New Tenth Division, about 30,000 people, recently fled to the area north of the Linzao branch line in southern Shandong.

### National Army Enters Southern Nenjiang; Communist Army on Songhua River Shells Bridge Workers

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 7th] The national army has now entered Guang'an in southern Nenjiang. Kaitong, Taonan, and Tao'an will also be recovered. In this way, the right wing of Harbin has been controlled by the national army, and the Pingqi and Changtao, Taodu and other railway lines are also in the hands of the national army. This development is highly valued.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 7th] This evening's newspaper here carried a Shenyang dispatch stating that the national army had peacefully advanced to ten Chinese miles from Dalian. Because there are still a few Soviet troops in Dalian, it did not advance. It is waiting for the central government to negotiate through diplomatic means. The citizens of Dalian believe that the government's takeover is not far away, and they are mostly storing banknotes in circulation to wait. In the Dalian market, the exchange rate between puppet Manchukuo currency and Soviet military tickets is four to ten. There are still 230,000 Japanese in the city who have not been repatriated. Their lives were better than those of the Chinese when the Soviet troops had not withdrawn. The communist vice mayor has been replaced by a person from the education sector.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 7th] People from Dalian said: The actions of the communist army in Dalian have become increasingly tense, looting materials and dismantling machinery. The citizens' resentment towards the communist army has deepened. Unarmed communist soldiers are often beaten by the crowd. Resistance in the suburbs is especially fierce. The lives of the citizens are difficult. White rice has exceeded 300 yuan per catty. The Japanese are even more impoverished. They are waiting day and night for the national army to take over. The communist army is actively collecting grain in the Jin and Fu counties, collecting and transporting it at any time, showing a sense of panic.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 7th] Deputy Commander Zheng returned to China and went to the Yingpan forward command post on the 6th.

Du Yuming, commander of the Northeast Security, has completed preparations to deal with the communist army's offensive.

### Jiaoji and Pingsui Lines Can Be Opened to Traffic on the 20th

Wang Yaowu Tours Along the Jiaoji Line

[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 7th] Wang Yaowu is touring various places along the Jiaoji Line and is scheduled to arrive in Qingdao on the 8th for a short stay.

[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 7th] Under the emergency repair by the Jiaoji Road Bureau, the east and west ends are gradually approaching. Only more than 20 miles between Huangqibao and Taerbao have not been restored. The road authorities believe that traffic can be restored on the 20th of this month.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 7th] The Pingjin Road Bureau ordered workers to fully repair the entire Pingsui Line. The eastern section, Beiping Zhangyuan, has been repaired and opened to traffic.

### Zhang Jia'ao Arrives in Beiping

Northeast Heavy Industry Has Started Work

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 7th] Zhang Jia'ao, chairman of the Northeast Economic Commission, flew from Shanghai to Beiping at noon on the 7th. If there are no problems with the plane, he will fly back to Shenyang on the 9th. Zhang has made progress on various issues of economic construction in the northeast during his month in Beijing. The recovery of industry and agriculture in the northeast will gradually enter the road to recovery due to Zhang's trip. After Zhang got off the plane, he told reporters that the takeover work in the northeast, which can be taken over, has been completed. Since November, heavy industrial machinery has begun to move, and those that can be started are gradually starting work. The central government has also approved the light industry production plan, and more than 100 units will start production this month. In addition, the agricultural recovery plan has also achieved results during this trip and will also begin this month. After returning to Shenyang, he will convene the heads of construction departments of various provinces to instruct the implementation steps. The funding for all this is not a problem. The central government has also approved the Economic Commission to allocate funds as much as possible to promote agricultural recovery, and strive to restore the production volume of various crops to the previous state. Zhang then answered reporters' questions, saying that the government has not considered recovering the puppet Manchukuo coupons and banknotes in circulation. Maintaining the permit system for the export of important materials is still necessary at this time. This is also a way to prevent the enemy from hiding materials. Zhang then said that although the northeast is rich in timber, the areas received by the government are only enough for local use. Although it may be possible to extract more after Andong is stabilized, transportation tools are a problem again. Finally, a reporter asked whether he had been instructed by Mr. Zhang Junmai to meet with Zhang Dongsun of the Democratic Socialist Society in Beiping and urge them to go to Shanghai. He replied: "Let's see how it goes."

### 政院撥款七億　急振魯西各縣

National Government Instructs Subordinate Agencies
Crack Down on Non-Military Personnel Wearing Military Uniforms

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th dispatch] The National Government issued instructions on the 6th to all subordinate agencies to crack down on non-military personnel wearing military uniforms. The original order is as follows: "The Executive Yuan submitted a report from the Ministry of National Defense stating: 'Military uniforms are stipulated in detail in the uniform regulations promulgated by the National Government, with the intention of maintaining dignified appearance and indicating military status. Non-military personnel should not wear them. It has come to our attention that in various places, it is common to see non-military personnel wearing military uniforms, which not only undermines the system but also risks unscrupulous individuals impersonating military personnel and causing trouble. Although this Ministry has repeatedly instructed the military police to correct this, it has proven difficult. To maintain order, we propose that the Executive Yuan forward a request to the National Government for a national directive that prohibits all non-military government and school personnel from wearing uniforms identical to those of military personnel. We also request that the Central Party Headquarters issue a directive to all levels of party personnel to refrain from wearing them as well, in order to uphold the system and maintain order.' This matter seems feasible upon review, and a formal document should be prepared and submitted for review and approval. Except for separate orders, all agencies should be informed, and their subordinate agencies should be instructed accordingly. This order is hereby issued.'"

Forty Billion Yuan of American Cotton
Worth Only One Demerit

Conclusion of Tianjin Storage Bureau Fire Case

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 7th dispatch] The American cotton, 4,095 bales of relief supplies stored at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company wharf by the Tianjin Storage and Transportation Bureau of the Executive Relief Administration, suddenly caught fire at 2 PM on September 19th, and was completely destroyed, resulting in losses exceeding 40 billion yuan.

Editorial: Please for America to Reconsider its Policy Toward Japan

A delegation of five members of the U.S. House Naval Affairs Committee, led by Chairman Isaac, who inspected Pacific island bases and the situations in China and Japan, arrived in Shanghai from Peiping on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the Pacific War. They made a statement to the press explaining the mission of their trip, highlighting four key points: (1) Close and positive relations are maintained between China and the United States; as long as the two countries cooperate hand-in-hand, peace in the Pacific is not difficult to maintain. (2) Peace in the Pacific means peace in the world. (3) The Pacific is the Pacific of the United States; all islands previously administered by Japan under mandate should be transferred to the United States for trusteeship. (4) The United States' policy toward Japan is to assist the Japanese people in walking toward a truly democratic path; the Japanese have not expressed any dissatisfaction with the policies implemented by the United States in Japan. (5) The United States does not have naval bases in China and is merely establishing a naval school in Qingdao at the request of the Chinese government; the United States is extremely willing to assist China in building a navy.

After listening to Representative Isaac's earnest remarks, we feel more optimistic and hopeful about the future of peace in the Pacific. However, we still feel that Representative Isaac has overlooked an "unknown factor," and this "unknown factor" is becoming increasingly important under the lenient policy that the United States has adopted toward Japan. Representative Isaac said, "The Japanese people have not expressed any dissatisfaction with the policies implemented by the United States in Japan," which seems to be quite gratifying, not unlike other Americans who are reveling in the beautiful dream of self-victory. There are certainly many objective factors contributing to this misconception; however, the most important factor is that the United States' view of the situation in the Pacific is too subjective. Although the United States learned a bloody lesson in the Pacific War that can never be forgotten, after Japan's surrender, it could not resist the Japanese people's "flattery" and completely forgot the trauma it had suffered. Treating defeated nations with such a spirit of generosity is certainly worthy of admiration by the world; however, the result of unreserved leniency not only does not benefit the peace in the post-war Pacific but also serves to foster the resurgence of Japan's old ways. General MacArthur recently issued an order requiring all Japanese people to hand over all their foreign currency, indiscriminately including Taiwanese and Koreans. Although this is a minor matter that is not worth mentioning, this move is sufficient to fuel the ambitions of the Japanese people and teach them to dream again of recovering Korea and Taiwan. To nip trouble in the bud, the U.S. authorities responsible for controlling Japan must be particularly cautious. In addition, General MacArthur has also allowed Japanese fishing fleets to sail to the Southern Ocean to hunt whales, and recently, Japanese fishing boats have even entered our country's territorial waters. In the eyes of us Chinese people, all of this is sufficient to fuel the rekindling of Japan's aggressive ambitions. Representative Isaac did not see the danger of the U.S. policy toward Japan in Japan and instead took the fact that the Japanese people had not expressed any dissatisfaction as a source of comfort. We believe that this view contains a great crisis. We cannot help but point this out and ask Representative Isaac to think again and again.

In fact, Japan's rapid recovery is a matter that is well known to the world and is causing anxiety not only in China. Even far-sighted Americans have long seen the danger of the U.S. policy toward Japan; especially in the current international situation, the contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union not only show no sign of disappearing but are becoming increasingly intense. They take opposing positions on any issue and cannot reach a consensus. This is true for issues in Europe and for issues in the Far East Pacific. The result of such friction will be painful for those close to them and pleasing for their enemies, only benefiting Japan. The Christian Council of America issued a statement on the 6th analyzing the situation in the Pacific and frankly said: "The result of the friction between the United States and the Soviet Union will instead give the Japanese militarists, whose nature is difficult to change, the opportunity to regain power." This sentence is truly worthy of the attention of the U.S. government and the public and should serve as a warning for the current situation in the Far East.

"It is no use crying over spilled milk, but the future can be pursued." Although the measures taken by the United States to control Japan in the past have not been satisfactory, the peace treaty with Japan has not yet been signed, and the Japanese reparations plan has not yet been decided. Starting today, it is not too late to catch up quickly and seek ways to remedy the situation. Therefore, we hope that Representative Isaac and the other four members of the delegation will be able to clearly inform the people of the country of the danger of the resurgence of Japanese militarists after they return home from touring the Pacific. They should be vigilant at all times and take precautions at all times. If the current U.S. policy toward Japan is not reviewed and remedied, then in five or ten years, the Pearl Harbor incident of five years ago will surely be repeated.

In short, for the sake of its own security and for the sake of peace in the Pacific, the United States has a real need to review its current policy toward Japan. Therefore, we want to ask Representative Isaac to take this opinion back to the country for the authorities to consider.

The Impact of the U.S. Coal Miners' Strike

The U.S. coal miners' strike has lasted for more than eighteen days and shows no sign of improvement. While United Mine Workers of America President Lewis was on trial, President Truman was enjoying his leisurely vacation 1,100 miles away on the U.S. West Coast. President Truman was confident, and Lewis was also too stubborn to compromise. According to the United States Information Service in Washington on the 4th, President Truman's secret weapon has been used. The federal court punished Lewis with a fine of $10,000 and the United Mine Workers of America with a fine of $3.5 million. If the strike does not end quickly, there is a possibility of heavier penalties. This huge fine indicates the government's determination to adopt a policy of suppression.

Since the end of World War II, labor strikes in the United States have emerged one after another, making the federal government exhausted to deal with them. The current coal miners' strike is more serious than other strikes. The daily production of 2 million tons of bituminous coal in 28 states has suddenly stopped. The government's coal reserves are only enough for 37 days, and even with strict conservation, it can only last for 60 days. According to the forecast of Secretary of the Interior Krug, if this strike is not resolved quickly, 65% of the power industry, 80% of the steel mills, 90% of the coal stoves, 86% of the railways, 90% of the cement companies, and 70% of the basic industries will have to close down. Twenty-five million American workers will lose their jobs. Other countries that rely on American coal for relief, such as Canada, France, Italy, and the Netherlands, will all be in a panic. American commentator Phillips even said: The world coal shortage and the coal miners' strike will result in political influences, making the divide between the two different political ideals in the world even more obvious.

Phillips' observation does contain a portion of truth. This U.S. coal miners' strike is not only a problem of workers' livelihood but also a problem of the struggle between the political forces of the union and the government. When the judge announced the verdict, he condemned "the coal miners' strike as a shocking event. If this threat is fulfilled, it will cause Americans to suffer from hunger, cold, and poverty, overthrow their government, and replace it with a dictatorship." He also said: "If there must be a choice between destroying the union and safeguarding the country, then the country should be given priority." Because 400,000 people went on strike, the judge actually talked about "overthrowing the government," "replacing it with a dictatorship," and "safeguarding the country," which can prove the serious political significance of this U.S. strike.

U.S. traditional politics has always been manipulated only by the Republican and Democratic parties. The power of the two parties has waxed and waned, but other parties have never been able to win over the majority of the public. There are also some left-leaning elements in the two parties, but they do not have the power to dominate their own parties. The real power is in the hands of capitalists and the middle class with intelligence and status in society. The activities of the Communist Party are limited, and even the National Federation of Labor cannot control it. Recently, the National Federation of Labor has also been making great efforts to exclude them. However, since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the power of American workers has gradually increased, especially the United Mine Workers of America led by Lewis, which is the leader of all American unions. Lewis is a sophisticated, calm, and profound leader. Not only coal miners but also other workers must listen to his command. On the eve of the war, he used the weaknesses of the two parties to win many rights for coal miners. If this strike he is leading is fulfilled, it will not be difficult for a powerful labor party to emerge in American politics in the future. If the British Labor Party after the war can take administrative power, then the American Labor Party is also in the ascendant.

However, the current situation in the United States is different from that in the United Kingdom. The people of the United Kingdom are eager to restore the pre-war economic level after the war, so they support the Labor Party's nationalization policy. The people of the United States are also eager to restore the pre-war standard of living, but they want the government to abolish price controls and develop freely. The British Labor Party has risen to prominence by advocating control, but American workers do not adopt the same policy. The American people urgently need a stable life. The spread of strikes and the stagnation of production will make people's lives more painful, and the union will lose the sympathy of the whole country. President Truman and the leaders of the two parties have recognized this situation, so their attitude is tough, and they insist on the policy of suppressing the policy.

We only see that after the court announced the verdict, except for the unions expressing indignation, the government officials, members of Congress, and the majority of the people of the whole country did not express much deep sympathy for Lewis. Any kind of movement that violates the interests of the people of the whole country and does not have the support of the majority is not easy to succeed. Lewis' move seems to be a wrong one. But at the same time, it is also a fact that prices in the United States are rising and workers' lives cannot be sustained. The U.S. government authorities cannot completely reject the workers' demands and act arbitrarily to the end. Unless both sides calmly reflect and reasonably compromise, both sides will inevitably be hurt, and the lives of the American people and the people of the whole world will be seriously hit. As the Chinese saying goes: "Those who recognize the times are outstanding people," we hope that President Truman will repeat the words of Lewis again and again.

This Year's Business Recession
Please for Banks to Provide Loans to Help Businesses in Difficulty
Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce Resolves Two Important Cases

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] The Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce held its third joint meeting of directors and supervisors in Zhenjiang on the 5th. Twenty-three directors and supervisors, including Lu Xiaobo, Zhu Gan臣, Qian Sunqing, and Zhang Jingli, attended and discussed two important proposals: (1) This year's business recession has led to frequent bankruptcies in various places. It is proposed to ask banks to change their methods and provide credit loans to help businesses in difficulty and maintain the market. The rationale is that bankruptcies of shops are almost daily occurrences in various places. With the end of the year approaching, the situation is becoming increasingly dire. Businesses cannot save themselves. If local conditions continue to deteriorate, on what basis can banks survive? In this difficult time, banks should provide credit loans to revitalize the market, saving both themselves and others. This is a duty that banks should fulfill. Please send a letter to the Four Joint Head Office and various head offices for thorough investigation and implementation. Resolution: Passed as proposed, please use real estate as collateral. (2) In the recovered areas of northern Jiangsu, if there are counterfeit currencies in the hands of ordinary people, it is proposed to ask the government to find a way to redeem them. The rationale is that in the recovered areas of northern Jiangsu, there are bound to be counterfeit currencies remaining among the people. Without a redemption mechanism, the losses of ordinary people will be increased. The government should investigate the number of these counterfeit currencies and find a way to redeem them to reduce losses. Resolution: Passed as proposed, it is recommended that the provincial government order the banks in the area to redeem them.

Three Difficulties in Handling Conscription in Various Counties

Symposium on Conscription in Wu, Su, and Chang Counties, Jiangsu

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 7th] Major General Zhang Yingchang, conscription supervisor of the Ministry of National Defense, convened a symposium at the Suzhou Garrison Headquarters on the 7th, inviting county magistrates, military section chiefs, and garrison commander Colonel Du Xu and directors of various sections, and battalion commanders of new recruits from Wu, Su, and Chang counties to review the conscription situation in various counties and provide guidance on future improvement measures. Summarizing the opinions put forward by the county magistrates, a total of three points were stated: (1) The new county system will be implemented, and various townships are being merged, so the preparation work is not good, which is undeniable. (2) There are no fixed conscription funds in the county budget, and the cost of recruiting new recruits is severely lacking. (3) The section responsible for conscription is not well-organized, and the personnel are insufficient to be deployed. Zhang immediately expressed that he would forward it to the Ministry of National Defense for reference. After the meeting, Zhang specifically met with reporters from this newspaper, hoping that public opinion would assist in promoting conscription work to complete this great task of building a Korean army. Zhang is scheduled to inspect the Second Battalion of New Recruits stationed in Suzhou and the urban self-defense battalion on the 8th. In the afternoon, he will inspect the headquarters of the New Recruits Battalion and inspect the situation of the new barracks and the treatment. He will stay for one or two days at most and then transfer to Songjiang for supervision.

Liu Hongsheng and Others Inspect the Executive Relief Administration Warehouse in Anqing

Mao Sen Visits Suzhou

Gives a Speech to Reporters
No Need to Worry About Security in Jiangnan

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 7th] General Mao Sen, Chief of Staff of the Wuxi Command of the Capital Garrison, arrived in Suzhou from Wuxi at 2:30 PM on the 7th. Military and political leaders of the town went to the station to greet him. Mao then met with reporters from this newspaper alone and made the following remarks: The work of suppressing bandits in the Jiangnan area has been actively carried out since the establishment of the Wuxi Command in September. At that time, the Ministry of National Defense investigated and found that there were more than 9,000 bandits, but a re-investigation in mid-October showed that they had been reduced to 4,500. Currently, most of them have been suppressed and pacified. Even if there are any remnants, they are only scattered remnants and can be eliminated soon. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the security problem in the Jiangnan area along the Beijing-Shanghai line in the future. The task of my trip is to inspect the suppression in the Taihu area and to review the surrendered troops, prepare to give them strict training, and supplement cadres in various units. As for whether a permanent concrete organization will be established in the Taihu area, it is difficult to determine at present. However, according to the past history and current situation of the Taihu area, there is a possibility of this. As for the issue of whether the Wuxi Command will be abolished, I believe that if the troops stationed in the Jiangnan area can be led by a long-term institutional organization, they will be able to exert their service functions even more. At about 3 PM, Mao, accompanied by Han Kai, the leader of the intelligence team stationed in Suzhou, and others, went to Mudu to inspect the suppression command and listen to reports from the heads of various sections. He also reviewed the surrendered troops of Liao Bingnan and Xu Jintang. He is scheduled to return to Wuxi after inspecting Wujiang on the 8th.

The Jiangsu Province's Advance Land Tax
To Offset This Year's Land Tax Amount
Limited to Two Months to Offset and Refund

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] In the past, in order to supply military rations, the province stipulated a food administration land tax plan, which was circulated for compliance and advance collection. This year's land tax in various counties has already begun, and the previous advance land tax has been stopped. In accordance with Article 6 of the original plan, grain households or grain merchants should be allowed to use the receipts of the advance collection to offset this year's land tax or return the physical objects to settle the account. The Provincial Land and Food Office has recently stipulated the method of offsetting the advance collection and has sent a telegram to various counties for processing. The important points of the method are summarized as follows: (1) Advance collection should be stopped before the day before the start of this year's land tax collection in various counties. (2) The exact amount of advance collection in various counties should be reported before December 15th as a basis for offsetting the payable rice. (3) After the advance collection is completed in various counties, the county government should prepare a clear list of the names and addresses of the advance grain households and the grain merchants from whom the loan was borrowed, as well as the amount and receipt number, and submit it for approval, and publish it in the local newspaper for public knowledge. (4) From the date of the start of the advance collection of land tax in various counties, each advance grain household should be notified to hold the receipt to offset the land tax of the 35th year within two months and exchange it for a formal string ticket. If the deadline is exceeded, the offsetting will not be continued. (If the amount of advance collection exceeds the amount of grain to be paid, it should be returned in one lump sum). A list should also be prepared and reported. The grain borrowed from the grain merchants should be returned by the government in one lump sum within the time limit and should not be delayed. (5) If the original advance collection certificate or loan certificate is lost by the advance grain household or the borrowing grain merchant, a guarantee should also be obtained and the advance collection agency should be requested to reissue a certificate before being allowed to offset or return the physical objects. (6) The conversion rate of the pre-collected land tax into brown rice in various counties shall be handled in accordance with Article 5 of the method of using the pre-collected land tax of the 35th year in this province to provide military rations. (That is, 5 shi and 1 sheng of brown rice are used to offset 1 dan of rice).

Transportation Difficulties and Exploitation of Weight
Crisis in Wuhu Rice Market
The Center of the Rice Industry Has a Tendency to Move to Yuxikou

[Our Wuhu Dispatch] Wuhu, which supports the economic center of Anhui, is based on the rice market, which has a long history. During the eight-year war of resistance, the rice market was completely destroyed. After the victory, the rice merchants rebuilt their strength and restored their old business, intending to revive the rice market and assist the commercial prosperity to save the economic crisis of the entire province. However, at first, there were all kinds of transportation difficulties, and recently, it was found that there were many private expenses. Farmers and rice vendors could not bear the heavy burden and regarded the transportation of rice to Wuhu for sale as a daunting task. They all changed to other ports to sell for profit. Recently, several rice merchants from He County and seven other counties took advantage of this opportunity to hold a meeting and attract grain stores from other ports to gather huge capital and plan to jointly establish a large enterprise company in Yuxikou, across the river from Wuhu, to purchase rice and grain and directly load it for export to other provinces. Transportation is convenient, private expenses are non-existent, and a large number of loans are to be obtained. The plan has gradually become concrete and will soon be realized. At that time, the Wuhu market will plummet.

Labor Dispute in the Sausage Skin Industry
[Our Report] A labor dispute has recently occurred in the local sausage skin industry. The wages of workers in the industry were originally 170,000 for the highest-paid and 80,000 for the lowest, with meals provided. Now, they are demanding a 150% increase on their original salaries. Yesterday, negotiations were held at the Bureau of Social Affairs. The compromise offered by the arbitrators was: for those who previously earned 100,000 per month, the current wage would be changed to 1.3 yuan per day, calculated based on the workers' cost of living index, with workers responsible for their own meals. The labor and management sides did not reach an agreement yesterday and will discuss it again another day. The management representative told reporters that the industry is currently in a slump, mainly due to poor exports and high pork prices. Before the War of Resistance, pork was 2 jiao per jin, and sausage skin was also 2 jiao per jin, so there was a profit to be made. Today, pork is 4,000 yuan per jiao, while sausage skin is only over 1,000 yuan per jin, so the profit margin for sausage skin is extremely low. If the labor side demands another 50% increase in wages, the management side is willing to accept it, but they cannot afford anything beyond that.

Public Utilities Bureau Does Not Oppose the Resumption of Business by China Merchants Electric Tramway, but It Must Not Hinder Unified Planning
[Our Report] The Public Utilities Bureau does not oppose the resumption of business by the Nanshi China Merchants Electric Tramway Company. However, the company's exclusive operating contract has already expired. The Public Utilities Bureau is making overall plans for the city's transportation. The past transportation situation, which was divided and fragmented due to the concessions, is no longer in line with the spirit of the times. Therefore, the municipal authorities have decided not to sign any more exclusive electric tramway operating contracts for specific districts. Although the China Merchants Electric Tramway Company's exclusive operating contract has expired, the Public Utilities Bureau will allow the company to continue using its existing vehicles and laid tracks. However, this must not hinder the Public Utilities Bureau's overall urban transportation plan. At the same time, the company cannot exist independently after the establishment of the unified urban transportation organization planned by the Public Utilities Bureau in the future and must join this new organization. It is unlikely that the China Merchants Electric Tramway Company will be able to renew its exclusive operating contract for Nanshi.
Nine Thieves and Other Criminals Escorted to Shanghai Prison: A Female Inmate Is Pretty, Wearing a Blue Cheongsam and Red Jacket; She Frowns While Leaving Her Fingerprint
[Our Report] Yesterday morning around 10:00 AM, nine criminals were escorted by the Songhu Garrison Command to the Shanghai Prison. They included Wang Yingcai (deserter), Liu Bozhou (general), Shen Zhixiang, Chen Yanlin, Zhenhua, Wang Xinqi, Lin Shu, Xu Quanyuan, and Wang Shaowu (all of the above are theft cases), sentenced to prison terms ranging from seven years to one year and six months. Among them, a female inmate, Qiao Linshu, 23 years old, from Yixing, is quite pretty, wearing a blue cheongsam and a red jacket. Before entering the prison, she frowned and teared up while leaving her fingerprint. She was then sent to the women's prison.
Murderer Zhang Xuegen Is Re-Indicted by the Higher Procuratorate for Suspicion of Being a Traitor
[Our Report] The Higher Court held a hearing yesterday afternoon to investigate multiple cases of suspected traitors:
(1) Zhang Xuegen was previously sentenced to twelve years in prison by the puppet court for murder. After the victory, the Higher Procuratorate re-investigated the case and filed a public prosecution against him for suspicion of being a traitor in accordance with the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. The indictment stated that Zhang had served as a soldier in the puppet Shanghai Security Team and worked at the joint liaison post in Miaohang, north of Shanghai. He extorted taxes from local civilian boats, and because of a dispute over the distribution of spoils, he beat his partner, He Yingtang, to death and fled to another place. Later, he served as a secret agent for the enemy's military police, harming the villagers. The defendant argued that he had served as a special operations squad leader in the Loyalty and Salvation Army at the beginning of the war. Later, because the troops were defeated, he was ordered to join the puppet Shanghai Security Command as a soldier, waiting for an opportunity to steal firearms. After being discovered, he killed He Yingtang, the puppet pistol squad leader of the unit, and fled back to his hometown. However, he was arrested by the enemy military policeman, Fuji, and forced to serve as a secret agent, which he refused. As a result, his elder brother and sister-in-law and wife were killed. The puppet Security Command learned about this and, considering him a fugitive murderer, sent him back to be sentenced to life imprisonment by the military law office. Later, when Chen Gongbo was appointed "Chairman," he granted amnesty, reducing the sentence to fifteen years. The puppet Minister of Justice Wu Songju granted another amnesty, reducing the sentence to twelve years. Zhou Gengsheng and Geng Were Tried.
(2) Zhou Gengsheng, Kan Chunyang, Ren Tianfu, and Yang Dezhi were accused by Quan Gao of Zhou having served as a squad leader in the enemy's military police and as a company commander in the puppet self-defense force. Que Ren and Yang were plainclothes intelligence officers in the Nanshi District of the enemy's military police. Taking advantage of the enemy's power, they conspired to seize the Riyuegang Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. At 4:00 AM on the 21st day of the sixth month of the lunar calendar in the 30th year, they searched the house, accusing him of secretly hiding military supplies and colluding with the central government. They reported to the enemy's military police and had Quan Changsheng and Quan Senlin arrested, and their fate is unknown. When questioned, the defendants all denied the accusations. Zhou claimed to be running a business, while the other defendants claimed to be laborers. They claimed that the accusations were completely false.
Zhang Zili Was Summoned for Questioning
(3) Zhang Zili, 41 years old, from Henan, was familiar with writing. He was originally an employee of the Yingchang Factory of the Da Zhonghua Match Company. After the enemy occupied Shanghai, Zhang opened a private Dongya Elementary School on Dongchang Road in Pudong and served as its principal. He registered with the puppet Shanghai Special Municipal Government and used textbooks compiled by the puppet organization to implement enslaved education. The defendant argued yesterday that Dongchang Elementary School was established in the 27th year and was later forced by the puppet Education Bureau to change its name to Dongya Elementary School. The use of textbooks compiled by the puppet organization was a common situation in the occupied areas. All teachers and staff in the school were patriotic, and although the curriculum was fixed, the teaching methods were up to him. The defendant claimed that in January of the 28th year, he was secretly ordered by the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters and the Youth League to serve as an intelligence officer and liaison officer in the fifth district of Shanghai and had presented the relevant documents.
All of the above cases are still under investigation, and the court ordered that further hearings be scheduled.
Involving Six Countries' Property Dispute, the Owner Will Sue in the Administrative Court
[Our Report] Regarding the property dispute involving six countries, the agent attorney of the owner, American company Meian, Yang Lizhi, told reporters yesterday that the company has not yet received the official reply from the Executive Yuan. If the Executive Yuan rejects the company's application for restitution, it will consider suing in the Nanjing Administrative Court. According to Meian, its original property was located at 1363 Yangshupu Road, covering an area of more than 30 mu, with fourteen warehouses. Before the Pacific War, it was mortgaged to Banque de l'Indochine and guaranteed by the Spanish Wangde Hall. After the Pacific War, Meian was unable to redeem the property due to business suspension. Wangde Hall paid on its behalf, and the mortgage certificate was transferred to Wangde Hall. Later, Wangde Hall sold it to the Japanese warehouse pillar company. According to Wangde Hall, it was forced to sell by the Japanese at the time and received millions of military yen.
"Anti-Japanese War Wife" Case Finalized by the Higher Court: Sa Benju and Shi Biren Each Receive a Two-Year Suspended Sentence; Original Sentence of Commutation to Fine Is Revoked
[Our Report] In the sensational "Anti-Japanese War Wife" case, the protagonist Sa Benju and his "Anti-Japanese War Wife" Shi Biren were sued by Sa's legal wife, Chen Jizheng, for adultery and obstruction of family. The local court sentenced Sa and Shi to four months in prison each, which could be commuted to a fine of 500 yuan per day. The defendants were dissatisfied with the sentence and appealed to the Higher Court, listing reasons and requesting that the original sentence be revoked and the appellants be acquitted or that the public prosecution be deemed inadmissible.
The Higher Court held a hearing on the case yesterday afternoon. It first asked Sa why he appealed. Sa replied that Chen Jizheng knew about his cohabitation with Shi beforehand. Being sentenced to imprisonment now has an impact on his future and reputation, so he requested a new ruling. Then Shi Biren was asked. Shi claimed that she had repeatedly asked Sa to go through legal procedures when they were living together. Sa claimed that they were both at the front and working under assumed names, so it would be inconvenient to go through legal procedures. The court immediately asked: You are both well-educated, so you should know that marriage is a major event in life. Why didn't you ask the other party if they had a spouse before cohabitating? Shi replied hesitantly: I did consider this, but I had never seen any indication that Sa had a spouse in his correspondence. Chen Jizheng knew about my relationship with Sa before filing the lawsuit, so why didn't she report it immediately? I have evidence to prove it. After saying this, she presented the clothes that Chen had torn during a previous struggle, causing laughter in the courtroom. The court then asked Shi if she was still cohabitating with Sa. Shi replied: I don't have that intention. I already have a child. If I am asked to leave him for emotional reasons, I will let nature take its course. The court then questioned Chen Jizheng. Chen replied: I have been married to Sa and have a son and a daughter. In 1943, Sa was transferred to Tunxi to work and left alone, claiming that soldiers were not allowed to bring their families with them. After the Xiang-Gui Battle, transportation was blocked, and contact was lost. It was only after the victory that I learned that he had come to Shanghai. The clothes that Shi Biren presented were torn by herself. This shows that on the one hand, she deliberately abandoned her family, and on the other hand, she obstructed the family. Finally, the prosecutor gave his arguments, and after the defendants' defense lawyers gave their replies, the court announced its verdict. Main text: The portion of the original judgment regarding commutation to a fine is revoked, and the remaining appeals are dismissed. Sa Benju and Shi Biren are each given a two-year suspended sentence. After the verdict, the court advised Sa and Shi that if they commit adultery or other crimes in the future, the original four-month prison sentence will still be enforced.

Social Services
Tian Shiru Asks: I am 28 years old and have been suffering from cardiomegaly for several months. I have been treated repeatedly without success. I would like to ask: 1. How can I restore my heart to its original size? Is electrotherapy effective? What kind of medication is effective? 2. Is cardiomegaly the same as "valvular heart disease"? 3. Are vitamins effective for this condition?
[Reply from Medical Doctor Gu Yuqi] 1. Slightly enlarged heart is not harmful. The most important thing is to check carefully for heart valve murmurs. Also, check for rapid and uneven heartbeats and swelling of the limbs. 2. Cardiomegaly is not necessarily valvular heart disease. 3. Taking vitamin pills is beneficial to the body. You can take more.
(Two) Headache Like Splitting
Ji Jinkang Asks: I am 20 years old and in good physical condition, but lately my head (between the eyebrows on the forehead) has been aching strangely like splitting, making it difficult to sit or lie down. I don't know what kind of disease this is. How should I treat it? Can I take the brain tonics sold on the market?
[Reply from Medical Doctor Gu Yuqi] A severe headache requires a detailed examination to determine the cause. Constipation and indigestion can also cause headaches. Eye diseases and spinal cord diseases can also cause headaches.
(Three) Powder Tumor on Forehead Corner
Liu Long Asks: 1. I suffered from otitis media. After it healed, the tinnitus did not go away. It buzzes every night when it is quiet. It has been like this for three or four years, getting better in the spring and recurring in the fall. Can it be cured? 2. There is a lump on the corner of my left forehead, about the size of a broad bean. It doesn't itch or hurt. White mucus comes out when I squeeze it. The lump flattens slightly, but it bulges again after a few days. Western doctors say it is a powder tumor and that I need surgery to remove the powder sac to flatten it. Is this correct? Are there any lotions, ointments, or oral medications that can treat it?
[Reply from Medical Doctor Gu Yuqi] 1. Tinnitus that has not healed for a long time may be related to the otitis media you had a few years ago. You should go to an ear specialist for a detailed examination to determine the treatment plan. 2. Local anesthesia and minor surgery to remove the powder tumor on the corner of your left forehead is the most radical cure.
Female Passenger Died Suddenly in a Train
Shi Xiaohong's Lost Property Awaits Relatives to Claim It
To Whom It May Concern: When train number 6 arrived at 13:00 on October 17, a female passenger (name unknown) traveling from Wuxi to Nanjing, carrying a six-year-old child and a luggage bag, died in the train. The district office has sent a letter to the Wujin District Procuratorate to send someone to examine the body, and the Changzhou Station Director Lu has received materials from the Wujin Chonghua Hall and notified the local security to bury the body. The remaining child and luggage bag are currently being properly cared for and kept by the district office. Since the remaining child is young and ignorant, even after detailed inquiries, we only know that the child's name is Shi Xiaohong, and we do not know the names and addresses of other family members, so we cannot notify them to come and claim the child. We have always admired your newspaper's enthusiasm for public welfare, so we are sending this letter in the hope that you will review it and publish it so that everyone will know.
Sincerely, Changzhou Jinghu District Railway Administration Police Department Jingxi Police Section Third Section

High Interest Rates Overwhelm Factories: Silk Industry Requests Central Bank to Change Silk Loan Measures; Raw Materials Stored in Factory for Manufacturing Exempt from Pledge
[Our Report] Liu Qingyi, standing director of the Electrical Silk Weaving Industry Association, told reporters: The industry is requesting the Central Bank to reduce the pledge for silk loans to a single item of finished products, allowing raw materials to be stored in the factory for manufacturing. The original method stipulated that raw materials should be used as collateral, which puts an excessive burden on factories. It is hoped that the authorities will understand the difficulties of the factories and approve the request. As for using loan money to repay high-interest loans, it is a last resort for silk weaving factories. The burden of interest has already caused factories with history and scale to close down. For example, the recently closed New Great Factory, its business policy has always been stable, and the manager has no speculative behavior. At the beginning of the victory, it even expanded production. This closure was mainly due to high-interest loans. Labor unrest and power outages reduced its production and were not enough to cover expenses. The factory's debt in April was 400 million yuan, and in August it increased by another 600 million yuan. In the three months of September, October, and November, it paid a total of 680 million yuan in interest, which was a fatal blow. Its monthly production was 150 million yuan, while its expenses reached 110 million yuan. With the interest outside, it was natural that it could not be sustained. If a sufficient amount of loans had been available in August to reduce the debt, the outcome would not have been like this. New Great's total debt is 1.7 billion yuan, of which 1 billion is loans from government banks. New Great's inventory is 1.3 billion yuan, which has now been sealed by the Central Bank. In my opinion, if the current debts of each factory cannot be resolved, more than 100 silk factories will follow in the footsteps of the New Great Factory this year. The Central Bank's Business Bureau has strictly investigated the cause of the New Great's closure, and the association has truthfully replied in detail. It is hoped that the Business Bureau can understand the threat of high-interest loans to the silk weaving industry and can flexibly handle the silk loan measures. It is also learned that the estimated amount of silk industry loans that have been lent is more than 2.2 billion yuan.
Also, the production loans for the electrical silk weaving industry, the Bank of Communications approved 16 companies, lent 1.002 billion yuan, the Bank of China approved 14 companies, lent 640.4 million yuan, totaling 1.6406 billion yuan in loans.

Shanghai Municipal Bank Handles Small Loans to Support the Development of Small Industries
In order to Encourage Production and Support the Development of Small Industries, the Shanghai Municipal Bank Has Implemented Small Loans and Followed the Ministry's Orders, Stipulating a Limit of 500,000 Yuan per Household, an Interest Rate of 5%, and a Repayment Period of Six Months.

After the Review Is Passed, the Payment Can Be Made, and Cash Can Be Received. However, the Bank, Considering That Various Handicraft Industries Are Scattered in Various Suburbs of the City, There Are Many Obstacles to the Implementation of Industrial Loans. In Order to Strengthen the Expansion, It Is Planning to Set Up Offices in Various Districts to Achieve Popularization. Currently, There Are Two Locations Ready for Preparation: Zhonghua Road and Zhongzheng East Road. It Is Learned That the Zhonghua Road Office Is Scheduled to Open on the 10th of This Month.

The Honor of Mozart Tao Xiong

Remembering My Teacher, Mr. Wan Jiabin

The great Mozart created immortal music, making him revered by later generations! This year, December 5th marks the 155th anniversary of his death, and we cannot help but remember him for his immortal music!

I remember at the end of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), the "Requiem" of the Roaring Drama Society was performed at the Guotai Theater in Chongqing. Cao Yu played the role of Mozart. I only saw the rehearsals and the rehearsal script of this play. At that time, I was moved to tears because I myself am a theater worker, and I have written several scripts. I have also tasted a lot of respect and contempt from others. Therefore, my distress for Mozart is not only sympathy but also a feeling of "experiencing the same pain" and sadness.

Mozart was a remarkable musician. His symphonies and operas are praised by millions of people. Theater managers relied on his operas to fill their pockets with money, and his lovers were surrounded and admired by audiences because of his operas. These people around Mozart were able to live comfortably, enjoying a delightful life of luxury. But Mozart himself had no bread when he ate, no firewood in the stove when it snowed, and no doctor or medicine when he was sick in bed. Mozart was so pitiful! His clothes were too thin to withstand the cold, and he didn't even have a complete set of clothes to wear out. When his own opera was performed in the theater, he could only listen at the theater entrance in tattered clothes. The audience's applause and Aloysia's singing seemed to mock his poor fate! The author of this opera was talking to a wandering, blind street musician in a neglected corner outside the theater. In the lonely night, he walked back alone on the quiet street. What a desolate scene! Why can a great artistic creator only be greeted by all kinds of misfortune?

Mozart was drinking on credit in a hotel. A sympathizer wanted to lend him some money, hoping he could improve his life. However, the wicked theater manager said, "If he has money, he won't be able to write anything." If Mozart couldn't write, the theater manager couldn't get rich, the actors couldn't live, and the old debts couldn't be paid off. Therefore, Mozart was destined to live in poverty.

Oh, the fate of the poor artistic worker!

Mozart finally died in hunger and poverty, from typhoid fever.

When he was alive, parasites hid in every one of his cells. When he died, the parasites dispersed without any reluctance. When Mozart was alive, he was hungry, cold, poor, and distressed; while those parasites were full, warm, rich, drinking and laughing all day long. Poor Mozart, he only lived for the pockets and stomachs of others. But his tunes are still being sung today and are constantly being revered by his descendants. Looking back at those parasites who surrounded him, their names have rotted in the soil along with their bodies.

My teacher Cao Yu often said, "People live to suffer a little more for themselves, so that others can enjoy more happiness?" This great maxim speaks to the purpose of an artistic worker and also determines the fate of an artistic worker!

### "A Song to Remember" - A Scene: Chopin's First Meeting with George Sand

Chaplin in France: Playing "Monsieur Verdoux" Ying Dai

Chaplin's new film after "The Great Dictator" has been rumored repeatedly that it could be completed and released by the end of this year. But the time was delayed, and it was only recently that filming began, and because the story takes place in France, it went to France to film.

The original name of the new film was "Bluebeard," but now it has been changed to "Monsieur Verdoux," and it is based on "Bluebeard" written by Charles Perrault. This is a section from "Tales of Times Past," which is completely realistic. It depicts the monster Bluebeard killing his wives and hiding them in a secret room. Because Bluebeard sneaked a peek into a room and forbade his wife to go out, his wife also secretly peeked, learned the secret, and intentionally killed his wife.

This surprising and mysterious detective story happened to occur after the end of World War I. At that time, many mysterious cases occurred in France, which the author recorded in the book "Tales of Times Past," and "Bluebeard" was also included. After the end of this World War, Chaplin compiled this story into a film script in his Beverly Hills mansion, preparing to film it. He still maintains his style of writing, directing, and acting, and Chaplin himself plays the role of "Bluebeard."

Chaplin is already a man of sixty years of age. His father was a leading actor in England, so he also acted on the English stage in his early years. Later, he went to Hollywood, entered the film industry, and became famous and wealthy. It has been more than thirty years since he started his film career. He usually lives in the United States. However, this time he is filming in Paris, the capital of France, and has expressed to people that after the new film is completed, he intends to live in France for a long time. Perhaps he is tired of life in Hollywood and wants to change the air?

Review of "Christmas Holiday" Bao Zhongqi

"Christmas Holiday" is a new work by Deanna Durbin after her marriage to Vaughn Paul, which changed her style. Obviously, this time she did not achieve the ideal success. Although we can see on the screen how hard she tried to portray the personality of the character in the play, the script and director restricted her, so she did not have the opportunity to exert greater acting skills. Therefore, all the performances seemed restrained and unnatural. If we take the entire film as a whole, it can really be called a film that is merely famous and does not live up to its name. The reason is very simple. The three words "Christmas Holiday" at least have some Christmas meaning left on the film, but from beginning to end, except for a hymn interspersed in a church scene, there are no traces of Christmas at all, and one cannot help but suspect whether the development of this script story is in a restaurant on Christmas Eve! Regarding this point, we do not know what profound meaning the film company has in titling it "Christmas Holiday"? Is it a business eye problem as Christmas Day approaches?

In fact, the development of the script is also quite far-fetched and abrupt. Many of the plots seem superfluous. Unnecessary shots instead prevent the audience from understanding the development of the plot. In the end, it destroys the atmosphere of the play, relaxes the audience's emotions, and reduces the effect of the entire film.

The story is roughly as follows: On Christmas Eve, Major Charles Mason meets singer Jackie in a restaurant. Jackie then tells of her miserable life experience: Initially, Jackie met a young man named Robert at a concert. They both loved music and soon discussed marriage. The woman did not know that Robert was a gambling addict. For several months after the marriage, they were able to get along well, but soon Robert's old habits relapsed. Because he lost in gambling, he killed the creditor and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The woman then sold herself as a singer. On that day, Robert escaped from prison and was eventually shot and killed by the police.

Of course, with such a far-fetched script, it is difficult for the director to please. The director's handling of the entire play is not clear and understandable enough. Durbin's (playing Jackie) narration of her life experience seems inverted, which makes people feel incomprehensible. The church and concert scenes are also too lengthy. Other scenes, such as Robert's trial in court and the final shooting, all seem extremely stiff and uncoordinated. Of course, there are some watchable shots. For example, when Major Charles receives a call from his fiancée, he talks to his friend on one hand and nonchalantly opens the call on the other. It is indeed very realistic. Other close-up shots of Durbin are also handled well.

Deanna Durbin is known for her singing, but in "Christmas Holiday," she only sings three times in total, and the song is only one - a jazz song in a dance hall, which is really disgusting. The male lead, Gene Kelly, who plays Robert, does not have enough delicate expressions and seems to have a thug-like, rough style. The actor who plays Major Charles is very good.

In short, this is a new film by Deanna Durbin after her marriage. At least many viewers came for her "name," but from various angles of observation, "Christmas Holiday" is undoubtedly a failed film.

Kangjian in "Far Away Love" - Harold Lloyd is back Xin Fang

Since Harold Lloyd retired from the film industry in 1938, his image has gradually faded in the minds of the audience. This time, Lloyd's first new work after returning to the screen is "The Sin of Harold Diddlebock," produced by RKO. Harold Lloyd on the screen is still wearing wide-rimmed glasses and broad-toed leather shoes, jumping and bouncing. He has not changed at all. However, today's audience is much more advanced than ten years ago, so in this new work, special attention is paid to all aspects of screenwriting, staging, and dialogue to let the audience know that Harold Lloyd has not changed, but he also wants the audience to know that Harold Lloyd is moving forward with the times.

It can be said that Harold Lloyd's return to the screen this time is entirely for the revival of the film industry in the post-war world. In terms of his family's finances, it is not necessary for him to work on the screen again. He has lived a very comfortable life at home in the seven years since he retired. He likes to collect telescopes and cars, and he also participates in social activities. He has three children, all of whom are now grown up. The eldest, Gloria, is twenty-two years old this year and is tall and plump. She has participated in filming under the banner of RKO. The second, Peggy, is now studying at a drama school. Harold Lloyd says that she also has a talent for acting. The youngest, Harold Jr., is only fifteen years old this year, but Hollywood's opinion is unanimous that he has the hope of inheriting his father's talent. Harold Lloyd himself also feels very honored.

Harold Lloyd's previous films, such as "Professor Beware," often insulted China or the Chinese. I hope that Harold Lloyd, after returning to the silver screen, should recognize the current situation in China and deeply understand the great Chinese nation, then the Chinese audience will also look at you with new eyes!

Oulala Township - Song of Life Liu Xiu

After reading the author's preface, I know that he has deeply fallen in love with the Yao area. The Yao Mountains are too beautiful, too full of life, and too capable of being developed! However, I have also been to Guangxi, but I have not discovered any beauty, any loveliness. What is the reason for this? Of course, an author is always objectively observing and seeking the truth.

Thinking of this, I suddenly understood the author's painstaking efforts. The beauty of the Yao Mountains, the life of the Yao Mountains, and the development of the Yao Mountains that he mentioned, isn't that just referring to "China"? We are Chinese, and haven't we all been to the Yao Mountains like me without feeling their beauty?

Shen Siyuan in the play: He is a person who only knows what to do all day long but doesn't do it; he knows the truth but doesn't have the courage to pursue it. He is like fog: he doesn't know anything, and he doesn't do anything. He is as pitiful as Lu Yong, who doesn't distinguish between right and wrong and does anything to eat. And Zhou Zhongzhe, who goes with the flow and lets nature take its course. Mo Sun, on the other hand, is a person who has thoughts and actions, but his thoughts are wrong, so the more he "acts," the deeper the mistake becomes. And our Shi Yizhi, this standard young man who has thoughts and actions to build China, is indeed a remarkable talent. But in the end, because he cannot carry it out to the end, all his achievements are destroyed. The author gave me a great stimulus here. He could have made him not leave the world, given him a glimmer of hope, but he didn't do that. He wants to deeply strike our hearts, so that we can be alert from regret and remorse! I am certainly saddened by the ending of Shi Yizhi, but I cannot but sympathize with the author's handling. I think it is not the author who truly murdered the protagonist, but us!

We want to suggest that if China wants to be revitalized, China has natural resources, and China has talents, the problem lies in whether everyone can know and act, do it, and do it to the end! Don't let Shen Siyuan's pessimistic remarks come true? "China has no youth"!

### Wen Quan's New Work - Random Talk on a New Three-Act Tragedy

### A Song to Remember

George Sand, a romantic female writer of the 19th century, said in her diary: "The capacity for passion has both cruel and sacred characteristics. The suffering of love should be ascending, not descending." George Sand was an individualist. She was not a viper. Chopin died in the "great forest of humanity." Her prediction came true. In the realm of art, through all the joys and sorrows of human life, Chopin's unparalleled talent and a tear from George Sand are enough to shine through hundreds of ages. In the final analysis, the melancholy and beauty of Chopin's music are rooted in love. But what is love for life? George Sand's diary answers: "This meaning is tears. If you cry, you are in love."

This is a play worth savoring. The script emphasizes revolutionary meaning and omits George Sand's family problems, which is reasonable. Especially good is the addition of a handful of Polish soil, which shows that Chopin is a son of the earth, and his death is just going home. Director Charles Vidor used a lot of montage techniques, and his skills are more refined than in "Cover Girl," almost in the style of "The Life of Emile Zola." Playing the piano under candlelight and boating under the night scene are poetic. The performances of "Hungarian Rhapsody" and the death scenes are touching. The soundtrack is all Chopin's masterpieces, which is a feast for the ears, as everyone knows. The actors are all able to perform well. Paul Muni manipulates freely and is full of fun. Merle Oberon plays the passionate George Sand, and her anger and candle-holding scenes give people a very strong impression. Her biting, trembling, and low-pitched tones are like George Sand herself. Merle's appearance is radiant, which seems to beautify George Sand, but it promotes our partiality. Cornel Wilde's Chopin has a depth of acting skills that surpasses "A Song to Remember," but his performance is not soft enough, and he still fails to portray a feminine patient with lung disease. Those who praise "A Song to Remember," if they have not seen the German film "Song of My Heart," which was released the year before last and narrates the late period of Tchaikovsky, I feel sorry for them.

### Sergeant York

Heroes come from the earth. Compared to Chopin, Sergeant York is even more of a son of the earth. Without romance, York is just an ordinary person. He cultivates his hope, and he cultivates his love. Every country in the world has provinces like Tennessee, mountain villages like the Three Forks Valley, and great people from the earth who are loyal to the earth like York. His achievements are not the will of God, but the will of justice. If we look at our struggle, on the top of Changbai Mountain and under the Taihang Mountains, how many Sergeant Yorks are there in China in the turbulent dust of war? They also have little lovers in the mountains and fields, poor and simple families, and farmers' dreams, and taverns selling drunkenness and making trouble. This is the American countryside under the pen of Steinbeck and Jesse Stuart, and it is also the Chinese village under the pen of Duanmu Hongliang. The success of "Sergeant York" is first and foremost the revelation of reality and humanity. I love it because it happened little by little in the Three Forks Valley, lightly, layer by layer. As soon as the plot develops into joining the army and fighting, I lose interest. Director Howard Hawks, I just watched his comedy "Ball of Fire" last week. His technique is as clean as the blue sky, spotless. Gary Cooper's portrayal of this kind of farmer's youth, with gentleness in his roughness, is a must. Joan Leslie's little lover is charming and innocent.

### The Flame of New Orleans

As a comedy with the flame forest as the background, it seems a bit unique because the jokes are moved from the living room to the wild. In fact, there is only one successful scene, which is the very ordinary double fight between two women for a man. Other than that, there is nothing to say. The thrills and excitements have not developed to the extreme. Compared with "Ball of Fire" and "Between Two Women," "The Flame of New Orleans" is still an empty play despite the color. It's just mediocre.

### The Crystal Ball

A pair of magical hands on a crystal ball, wiping back and forth, creating the fate of love. The subtitles and the ending are the best. The screenwriter's choice of material is not as vulgar as "The Flame of New Orleans." The plot may develop similarly to "The Gay Deception," but the director is not smart enough. Except for the continuous rejection of the three, the rest of the mystery is insufficient, the tempo is slow, and it is not brisk enough. Ray Milland and Paulette Goddard cannot revive it. One of the key characters, Virginia Field, is beautiful and elegant, and she is better than Paulette Goddard. It is unfair to let her be rejected.

Spring and Autumn - My Recent Life and Writing - One - Ying Ye

It's been almost two months since I came back from Dihua (Urumqi). I'm still busy every day. Thank you for asking about my recent life. What I can tell you is that I am trying to settle down and focus on work. The first thing I'm busy with is "teaching." Classes at Central University have already started. This semester, I have three courses: History of Chinese Opera, Liu Zihou's Collection and Essays on the Four Books. Because of rumors outside, my teaching hours have been increased, which is terrible! The second thing I'm busy with is "organizing books" and "copying books." The boxes of books I brought back from Sichuan, the "remaining" books I collected in Shanghai, there are still about ten thousand books. Classifying, supplementing, and organizing them is busy enough! Nanjing City has also established a "Local History Museum," and the position of curator of this museum has been added to my head. So, in addition to organizing my own books, I also have to organize and copy books for the public. The third thing is "engraving books." I didn't expect that I would resume my book engraving plan in such a short time. It is being engraved in Yangzhou now, at a price of 30,000 yuan per thousand characters. I think I can engrave at least a few thousand words a month. Brother, you see, from morning to night, how can I have any free time?

As for my "secret society" life, I am now avoiding meetings and no longer "attending every meeting"! I broke my alcohol abstinence because of my trip to the West. When can I find time to go to Daicheng (a restaurant) for plum blossom wine? How about it?

Two - He Tianlun

I think the life of a painter is like the life of a nun. I am a painter, and I am prepared to live a nun-like life forever; so my life has not changed now.

A nun's life is simple, bitter, and lonely. If a nun cannot endure this kind of life and wants to be greedy for joy and excitement, then she is nothing more than an prostitute inside and a nun outside; then I will maintain the rules and regulations and strongly oppose it.

The value of a work of art is like a bowl of clear water. If you put something else in the clear water to deceive people into drinking it, you will lose the value of the clear water itself; and people will not treat it as clear water to drink. The value of a work of art is like the value of clear water. We sell clear water to people to drink, and they can drink it if they want! We never hope that people will drink it as tea, wine, or sweet juice, or that they will have a reaction from their stomachs and feel that it is bitter water. Therefore, when I sell clear water to people to drink, I will never mix anything else in it!

I haven't been painting these days because I just came back from traveling, and my poetic inspiration is very strong. I can only wait until I have exhausted my poetic inspiration before I can paint again!

Three - Sun Fuxi

I am unable to write or paint because I am busy looking for a house every day. Since the Anti-Japanese War, I have traveled to various provinces, first Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang, and then Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. I have seen too much, and I have no time to organize it, so I have not started writing any literary works or paintings.

Recently, I have been particularly interested in the streets of Shanghai, and perhaps I can create some works.

Four - Liu Shi

"Poverty before attack," attack before poverty, the poorer the attack, the more the attack, the poorer! - This is my life and writing situation. Friends advise me to change careers, and I have also considered it repeatedly: being a professor, the monthly salary is not as good as a model; writing articles, the稿fee is not as good as a typesetter; changing careers, changing careers to do business, I have no capital; being an official, I lack connections; riding a tricycle, I lack strength; being a robber, I am afraid of breaking the law... so I am still poor, I still have to attack, I will always be poor, I will always attack; I don't blame heaven, I don't blame others: I will be a monk for a day, and I will toll the bell for a day.

Five - Wu Shuyu

During the Anti-Japanese War, I was in Chongqing. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, I came to Shanghai. Unfortunately, I came too late. I was neither able to "take over" nor did I encounter "changing careers." From a唯生史观(historical materialism) perspective, livelihood is important. I couldn't afford it, so I had to take advantage of the opportunity to return to the capital and explain to my wife, who has a yellow face (ugly), that I would command the Wu family army (four of them) and temporarily garrison Changsha; as for the fifth regiment, it had already been supplemented and trained, and it could be expanded and established within the year. In this way, my wife with a yellow face is worried that I will be alone and single-handedly闖江湖 (roam around), claiming to be a hero, and may encounter danger; on the other hand, she feels that the training and supplies for those Wu family army members are overwhelming, so today she writes a letter saying she wants to come to Nanjing, and tomorrow she will write a letter saying she wants to come to Shanghai. What about me? The mud and sand of Shanghai滩 (Shanghai) haven't been化騐 (tested) yet, so I can't land for the time being. If she rashly sends troops, then my life will be like the Song of Chu, and I might have to sing Farewell My Concubine again. Although, my subconscious thought is that this is not Wujiang (the river where Xiang Yu committed suicide), so why should I reluctantly imitate the ancients and be ridiculed for being infatuated with bones? But, if you want to go to the Bund in Shanghai, walk from Haig Road to Jing'an Temple, and jump on the tram, four hundred yuan of "Chinese legal tender" (these four words are the public announcement on the tram, please don't make a mistake, proofreader) can get you to the end, wouldn't that add another lonely ghost like me out of thin air?

Because of these things, every day of my life, in addition to eating and sleeping, I am busy writing love letters to my wife with a yellow face; in fact, writing love letters to my wife with a yellow face is not as good as writing love letters to a mistress? This is writing it out of necessity, to stabilize her so that she absolutely cannot lead my Wu family army to land on Shanghai灘 (Shanghai) before I have established my beachhead position. In addition to this time, I also simulate the lives of writers and write some manuscripts; but the publishing industry is not doing well, and bookstore owners don't want long ones. As for short ones, I can only write a little bit of隨筆雜文 (random essays) and those kinds of thousand-character articles. When I pick up my pen and open my mouth, the editors say that I am complaining and scolding people and cannot publish it. Writing it and writing it, I am really forced to be very difficult. Please teach me, Editor of Spring and Autumn, Brother, let me tell you a truth. When a beggar is begging for alms at the door of a "wealthy family," how dare he complain and scold people?

Six - Guo Guni

I am an amateur in literature; I have quite an interest in learning painting. During the Anti-Japanese War, I painted some watercolors. But in the end, due to an unstable life and running around for food and clothing, I was unable to make much effort in this area. Recently, "Taosheng Monthly" is about to resume publication, and I have been running to the printing house these days, which seems very busy. After Taosheng is published, I plan to cooperate with Liu Shi to compile a volume of "Art Forum" to do some cultivation work for today's art world.

Seven - Hu Shuo

During the Anti-Japanese War, I edited newspapers in the Third War Zone. After the victory, I returned to Shanghai and became a Chinese teacher in a middle school again. In the past year, I have been working as a "teacher," going to the classroom during the day and correcting students' papers at night. My life has been so entangled that I am a bit overwhelmed.

Because I have very little free time, I haven't written much fiction lately. But I have written some odds and ends in my busy time. I do most of my writing at night, often staying up until midnight before going to bed; I use trembling hands to write down my feelings of travel and to express my dissatisfaction with this world.

Recently, I plan to publish a collection of essays, and I am also preparing to compile a collection of novels that I published eight years ago. To put an end to the "chicken ribs" around me. If my work is a little easier next year, I would like to write more novels.

Eight - Ding Yitan

My recent life, in addition to the daily routine of reading books, reading newspapers, visiting friends, and other things, is to interview social situations, trying to find out the causes and consequences of the problems I have planned to address. However, what I feel most painful in my spirit is that many situations do not allow free recording and free publication; so I always absorb more and write less, and I often put my manuscripts aside halfway through.

Nine - Huang Hanran

Speaking of life, I am reminded that everyone has their own ups and downs of happiness and suffering, but the situations are different. Looking back to the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, I went out to escape the disaster. On the way, I was caught by the local strongmen because I lingered over the scenery and was mistaken for a spy. Even the ironclad evidence of my school badge and school letter could not be counted. Fortunately, there were still acquaintances in the local area, and I was immediately bailed out. After returning to Shanghai, I lived in seclusion in a pigeon cage. For the past seven or eight years, the most painful thing I felt was to be the father of a poor teacher and to take care of the illnesses of three children; in the end, they were all incurable, but I sincerely bless them for not tasting the bitterness of the world again. After the victory, friends from the rear came to Shanghai one after another, and Song Nu Middle School, which had only one house left, was able to resume school. Shanghai also newly established an Art Normal School. On one hand, old friends reunited, and on the other hand, there were more than 800 young people listening to my lectures every week. What could be more joyful! This shows that the most mysterious and unpredictable thing in the world is the Creator playing with people. Therefore, my time for painting and reading is very little. Sometimes, I occasionally respond to the students' requests and play world-famous songs on the flute to share the joy.

Recently, I translated an article "On the Artistic Position of Life." The author uses simple words to explain literature, drama, dance, film, music, painting, sculpture, architecture, and decorative patterns. This allows the students to understand what these nine types are artistic. This article has been sent to Mr. Jin Shan.

Ten - Zhu Chaoran

I am a foot soldier in the news industry, and I have been holding my post for sixteen years. My recent life is still inseparable from the news industry. Starting in February of this year, I restored the "China Current Affairs News Agency," which I founded and which was suspended for five years (during the enemy's occupation of Shanghai). In addition to the news department, there is a data department that specializes in collecting and investigating various items, including literary and art materials. As for the writing situation, there are only short articles scattered in various newspapers because most of my time is occupied by社事 (news agency affairs).

Eleven - [Blank Name]

Since I returned to the East, in order to improve the study of calligraphy and painting, I have opened a room in my residence as the Yunlin Calligraphy and Painting Society, as a place for discussion and exhibitions. I have also asked Wu Zhihui, Zhang Puquan, Niu Tisheng, Li Shizeng, Ye Xiaweng, Shen Yinmo, Hu Yisheng, and Zhang Mojun, old men to sell calligraphy and painting as a promotion. However, in terms of writing, I have rarely been able to complete any articles due to mundane matters. I have only written a few poems, which are only for embellishment and social interaction.

Twelve - Nima

My excessive busyness at work often deprives me of my reading and writing time. I love to participate in literary and art gatherings, and I also love to make friends with people in the literary and art world; but there are too few literary and art gatherings, and everyone is not necessarily free during the day. - This is my distress, and I think it is also the distress of the general professional youth who love literature and art.

The Crossroads of Genius - After Watching "A Song to Remember" Lan Ning

When a person comes to a crossroads of love and responsibility, ease and hardship, tranquility and struggle, it is not easy to choose a direction. Even a great genius like Chopin cannot avoid feeling confused for a while.

Chopin grew up in Poland under the rule of the Tsar, and the tragic fate of the oppressed people was engraved on his heart. But when he arrived in Paris and was recognized as an unparalleled genius, and when he fell in love with George Sand, a French romantic novelist with a strong will, Chopin was faced with two completely different paths. On one side was George Sand's world, tranquility, ease, and happiness. He could bury himself in creation and write more of his immortal nocturnes, waltzes... delicate and beautiful musical pieces. But he would be isolated from the real world, he would have to forget his parents, siblings, young comrades, and millions of suffering compatriots in his motherland under the Tsar's iron heel. He would be confined to his own ivory tower, forever a prisoner of George Sand's love.

On the other side was Poland in hell, without freedom, without equality, a Poland being divided. The people were waiting for liberation, and the liberation movement was waiting for economic assistance; but Chopin, who was most capable of raising funds to support the revolution, was immersed in George Sand's embrace.

Such a major choice was indeed troubling for the gentle and weak Chopin. But Chopin, who had lived with Sand for ten years and never dared to slightly disobey her wishes, chose the latter this time. Thinking of his motherland, thinking of the suffering people, he broke free from the bonds of Sand's love and walked out of the ivory tower. Without any resentment, he willingly endured hardship until his death.

And Chopin's death soon came. Because his decision to dedicate himself to his motherland actually shortened his life. With his weak body afflicted with lung disease, touring Europe and raising funds everywhere was tantamount to suicide. It was just that he was so brave, silently, calmly, and willingly picking up this destiny.

Shortening Chopin's life is shortening the immortal creation of genius, some people may say. Yes, genius should have belonged to the world, not Poland; to history, not to any particular era. He should not be disturbed for the sake of Poland's liberation movement.

But a genius who is detached from the masses, a genius who has no love for the vast majority of humanity, can the immortal works he creates, which are only enough to entertain a few elegant and leisurely aristocrats in the "salon," be expected to arouse the resonance of the vast masses? Isn't such a buried genius too small?

Sketch Lin Bailang

Lin Bailang (Rembrandt 1606-1664), I don't understand is a representative writer of the Netherlands, he has occupied a glorious page in the history of world art. His works are very thick, and he has a special expression for light and dark. The picture is full of inner and mysterious emotional atmosphere, and the sketch is especially cherished by the world. This is an ink painting drawn with a quill pen, the technique is superb, and the brushstrokes are light and lively. (Lion)

An Inch of Rivers and Mountains, An Inch of Blood - 116 - Ye Jingfeng

Little did he know that his seemingly insane behavior originally had a great effect. Rather than saying that this effect was entirely for Tsurumi alone, it was more accurate to say that it was for Pingzi. However, Pingzi was just a woman in her twenties, only a little more beautiful than the average woman and a little more intelligent. Why would this魔星 (troublemaker) spend so much effort and put on such a crazy performance? It is necessary to know that Pingzi is a special member of the Black Dragon Society on one hand, but on the other hand, she has recently joined the ranks of Elder Aoki. Aoki is a student of Saionji, and this元老派 (elder statesman) Saionji still has considerable power of attraction in Japanese internal affairs and can launch counter-actions against the views of the ruling person. His counter-actions can touch the Emperor's heart above and arouse the people's attention below. Of course, the Emperor and the common people do not count for much in the eyes of today's politicians and warlords, but it is better to avoid trouble than to create it. Suppose that this ruling figure can spend a little bit of performance to win the元老派 (elder statesmen) not launching counter-actions, wouldn't it be worthwhile?

This guy spent more than half an hour of "忍" (patience), reading that passage of the book, before clapping his hands repeatedly, calling the female servant crawling on the ground to pour wine. One cup, two cups, three cups, to re-moisten his throat, which had become somewhat dry and hoarse from reading. He took the opportunity to lie there and rest for a while before raising himself up and sitting down.

What the hell is this guy up to? Why did he do this? Why did he read such a long passage? What exactly was he reading? These questions were repeatedly overturned in Tsurumi's mind. Tsurumi can be said to have grown up in Japan and received a purely Japanese education. At a minimum, he should understand the Japanese dialect. So why doesn't he understand this guy's "轰鸡脚哇鸭脚 (nonsense)"?

Little did he know that what Konoe was reading was the Chinese ancient book "Guoyu Guoce," which they called the Sacred Scripture and Treasure Canon. The phonological reading was the tone of 中州 (central plains). Since he was not singing 西皮二黄 (Peking opera), why did he use the 中州 (central plains) tone? Because he had to use the tone of the 口木古劇 (kabuki) in order to read ancient books, first, to show emphasis, and second, to show off his profound knowledge.

Helplessly, the tone of Japanese ancient drama, since the Chinese Tang Dynasty 正韻 (correct rhyme) was passed to Japan, after the old actors learned it, it has been transformed I don't know how much, and it has been passed down through the ages, simply turning the original Tang rhyme into a pot of vinegar糟 (lees), making it neither cow nor horse, neither fish nor fowl. In addition, the Japanese originally have incomplete five tones, and each of their nasal passages has some problems, so the more they 轰 (boom) and 哼 (hum), the more they make it impossible to be a tone, it is simply like a wolf howling and a cow humming, and like a dog eating full of feces, wanting to bark, but unable to bark,

### Hopes of Reopening Peace Talks Seem Dashed: U.S. Ambassador Calls on Chairman for Long Talk, Special Envoy Marshall Makes No Preparations to Return to the U.S.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] Hopes for the resumption of peace talks appear dashed. According to sources close to the U.S. side, the political and military conditions proposed by the Communist Party clearly indicate a refusal to accept mediation by Marshall and Stuart. Moreover, Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart have been in frequent contact with Chairman Chiang in recent days. On the morning of the 7th at 11:00 AM, Ambassador Stuart, accompanied by Economic Advisor John Leighton Stuart, visited Chairman Chiang and conferred for an hour before leaving.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] A spokesperson for Special Envoy Marshall's residence stated that reports of Marshall's return to the U.S. before Christmas are untrue, as Marshall has made no plans to return thus far. However, the spokesperson did not rule out the possibility of Marshall returning to the U.S. to consult with President Truman or other U.S. government leaders.

[United Press Washington Dispatch, 6th] Experts on Far Eastern affairs at the U.S. State Department unanimously believe that if a full-scale civil war breaks out in China, a re-evaluation of U.S. policy toward China may be necessary, but they do not believe that the overall situation in China is beyond salvation. Reliable sources say that if the National Assembly can adopt the revised draft constitution proposed by Chairman Chiang and adhere to it faithfully, the resumption of negotiations between the Nationalists and the Communists is possible. They added that Marshall would not continue to stay in China if he sees no hope of a resolution. Currently, there are four possible courses of action advocated by various parties in the U.S.: (1) Full economic support for Chairman Chiang. (2) Continued adherence to the current neutral policy toward the Chinese civil war, with limited economic assistance to the National Government. (3) Adoption of a firm policy requiring the government to find a way to end the civil war before providing assistance. (4) Complete withdrawal from China.

### Miscellaneous Notes from the Constitutional Review Committee

— Our Reporters Yu Zhenji and Pu Dejie

The Second Group Unanimously Elects "Elder of Peace" as Chairman

The first review committee met in the afternoon. Initially, a secretary read the minutes of the 6th meeting, but his voice was as faint as a mosquito's, making it difficult for those in the front row to hear clearly. Another secretary was then asked to read from the podium, but after reading "All rise," he continued with "Matters for discussion." A delegate stood up and questioned, "It only says 'All rise,' but nothing follows. Are we supposed to keep standing there until now?" The entire room burst into laughter.

Min Da, a representative of the Youth Party, and Luo Feixuan, a representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, both spoke at the first review session today. The former began by saying, "I am a member of the Youth Party," and repeatedly mentioned "the party's platform." The latter constantly reiterated the Three Principles of the People. Both speeches garnered considerable applause.

During the discussion of the "Preamble," a delegate opposed adding the words "Father of the Nation" before "Mr. Sun Yat-sen." According to him, he had heard that Mr. Sun preferred to be addressed as "Mr." and was disinclined to accept other titles. Zou Lu, a revolutionary elder well-versed in party and national history, listened attentively but did not speak when a delegate made a speech.

Many well-known lawyers and rhetoricians attended the first review committee, scrutinizing every word and phrase in the "Preamble." For example, they changed "Always and entirely follow" to "Entirely and always follow." Wang Wanping considered this to be too scholarly.

Li Jianfu believed that "Based on the teachings" was better than "Following the teachings." The word "Following" carries a sense of hierarchy and inequality, bordering on the despicable (much applause). Li's speech posture resembled boxing, and he spoke about China and foreign countries, even mentioning Marshall. He ended his lengthy discourse abruptly after being opposed by a delegate.

Xiao Yishan extensively quoted classical texts, even citing famous sayings from the Analects as proof. He argued that adding the six words "Creator of the Republic of China" as a "hat" above "Mr. Sun Yat-sen" would make perfect sense.

The convening meeting of the second review committee proceeded in a very harmonious and pleasant atmosphere. Only principles were proposed for each item, and the final decision was left to the second plenary session of the review committee. Regarding the progress of the proposal review, the difficulties encountered by each group were due to the deadline for receiving proposals being extended to midnight on the 7th. In addition, there were too many broad opinions, so the secretariat could not complete the printing in time. Since the scope of review for the second review committee was more important, it was decided to work and wait simultaneously.

Zhu Hongru, a representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, said, "The situation in our group is more complicated. Mr. Shao must be the chairman. Fortunately, Mr. Shao only has a headache."

At 4:20 PM, the "Elder of Peace," Shao Lizi, arrived with a smile. Everyone stood up to welcome him. Shao slowly sat down and listened to Lin Bin explain the committee's decisions to him. When he heard that there would be another meeting on the 8th, he quickly said, "There will be another meeting tomorrow afternoon, so I will have to ask for leave. Tomorrow is Sunday, so I must ask for leave." Everyone then asked him to preside over the plenary review meeting on the 9th. Shao said, "No, no, my throat hurts as soon as I speak. I'm afraid I'll have to ask for leave the day after tomorrow." Zhu Hongru said, "Resting for a day will make you feel better." "Rest? I can't rest at all. You see, I just wanted to slack off and not come to the meeting, but I happened to be caught by the representatives from Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan. I found them and talked for a long time." As he spoke, he shook his head, but he definitely refused to be the chairman on the 9th.

After the meeting, everyone started talking about the election of National Assembly representatives from professional groups and women. Lin Bin said, "I'm afraid there will be a dispute over this point." Yi Weijing, a representative of the Youth Party, said, "I think that female representatives should not exclude themselves from the people, but I don't think it's good to say this, and I dare not say it." Shao Lizi said, "The constitutions of various countries do not have provisions for the election of agricultural, industrial, and professional groups. There will probably be a lot of noise, but the point about women will probably be added."

Only two and a half review meetings were held on the 7th, one each for the first and sixth committees, and half for the second. From the perspective of the entire National Assembly, it was quite deserted, but in reality, it was still lively and enjoyable. Perhaps because it was the weekend, besides the hard-working procedural group, the representatives' interest lay in the "unprecedented complete musical performance" on the night of the 7th and the "joint land and air force exercise" on the morning of the 8th. The reporters also had no choice but to join in the excitement with trepidation.

The review of the draft constitution has begun. The relationship between the Legislative Yuan and the National Assembly had already become a point of contention during the extensive discussions at the National Assembly. It is feared that there will be much debate in the review committee as well. Ruan Yicheng and others had already submitted three written amendments to the presidium, and now someone has proposed a fourth incomplete idea, hoping that after the constitution is promulgated, a new National Assembly will be established first, and Legislative Yuan members will be elected by the new National Assembly representatives, but they will not hold both positions concurrently. This view is also one that is closer to the views of all parties, and it needs to be decided in the review committee whether to adopt it or not.

Whether the period between the promulgation and implementation of the constitution is an extension of political tutelage or the beginning of constitutional government is also a matter of concern to all parties. The general view is that since the National Assembly has already opened, political tutelage must be considered to have ended. However, before the election and convocation of the National Assembly under the constitution, there must be an organ to exercise political power. Therefore, there are two options: (1) The National Political Council is appointed as the organ of political power. (2) The National Assembly that drafted the constitution and the National Political Council each elect a number of people to form an organ of political power, and all current officials are not allowed to be elected, in order to show the separation of powers. The above two views are still in the stage of brewing. Regarding the implementation law after the promulgation of the constitution, Gu Yuqun and Ruan Yicheng both have this opinion, and Gu even formally put it forward in his speech. Some people advocate stipulating transitional clauses and placing them in the annexes to the constitution, and stating that they will lose their effect after the implementation of the constitution. Zhou Gengsheng once had this opinion. This point is indeed a problem that the National Assembly should consider at the same time under the task of constitution-making, and it also needs to be discussed in the review committee. (December 7th)

[Central News Agency Hanoi Dispatch, 7th] According to local Chinese newspapers, the total number of overseas Chinese who were arrested in the Vietnamese area during the conflict between French and Vietnamese forces in Haiphong and retreated to foreign countries with the Vietnamese army reached about 1,000. According to overseas Chinese who fled to Hanoi, this group of overseas Chinese was subjected to humiliation by the Vietnamese army, and some were shot. Those who were not killed are now displaced.

General Morlière sent a note to Vo Nguyen Giap on the same day, stating that the French conditions for resolving the Haiphong incident were based on military needs and were proposed under orders. However, Morlière guaranteed that the commercial status of Haiphong and other non-military matters would not be included in the conditions. Vo has not yet responded to this.

### Guangzhou Customs Seizes Major Smuggling Case, Thirteen Banks Will Close as a Result, Silk and Silver Worth 1 Billion Yuan Confiscated
