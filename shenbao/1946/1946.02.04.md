### Northeast Soviet Army Delays Withdrawal; Reception Work Remains Stalled; Northeast Political Committee to Hold Regular Meetings

[Special Dispatch from Changchun, 2nd] Reception work in various departments of the Northeast is currently stalled, and the withdrawal of the Soviet army has also been delayed. The reasons are unknown. It is generally believed that Sino-Soviet diplomatic negotiations have entered a new phase, and the future development is of great concern to all parties. Although the stagnation of reception in various places is related to diplomacy, it cannot be regarded as a purely diplomatic issue. In areas where reception has not yet taken place, there are communist forces. They refuse central reception, citing the need to await the final results of the Political Consultative Conference. Due to the lack of information here, details of the Political Consultative Conference are largely unknown. Such waiting will inevitably prolong the time, so everyone hopes that the administrative authorities can find a clear solution to break this deadlock as soon as possible.

[Special Dispatch from Peiping, 2nd] Dark clouds loom over the Northeast, and a clear outlook is unlikely in the short term. The Soviet army was originally scheduled to withdraw completely by Lunar New Year's Eve, but it has been indefinitely delayed due to inadequate preparations. The elite New Sixth Army has completed its landing. According to news received yesterday, the unit is advancing toward Goubangzi, and may soon be stationed in Shenyang and Changchun. People familiar with the situation in the Northeast pointed out to reporters that there are already over one million guerrilla troops in the Northeast, and the situation is extremely complex. Simply transferring some troops from within the passes and receiving some important towns from the Soviet army will likely not solve the whole problem. For now, it is impossible to go to Andong for reception, and there are also problems in Hailar, Xing'an Province. It is rumored that Mo Dehui suggested the establishment of a Northeast Mediation Executive Department; whether this is true remains to be seen. The Northeast Headquarters seems to be making every effort to strengthen its political lineup, announcing that the Northeast Political Committee, which has been under consideration for several months, will hold its first plenary committee meeting in Peiping before the 10th of this month. The notification is said to be issued soon. Xiong Shihui is the chairman of the committee, and the members include Mo Dehui, Zhu Qing, Wan Fulin, Ma Zhanshan, Zou Zuohua, Feng Yong, Zhang Zuoxiang, Wang Shuhan, Namuji, and Qingse Leng, totaling nine people. Regarding the progress of the Northeast industrial and mining issue, one of the personnel receiving the Fushun coal mine is said to be missing.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 3rd] 560 reception personnel from the nine provinces and two cities of the Northeast, who were staying in Chongqing, have been ordered to depart within days, as the situation in the Northeast has become clear. It is understood that China National Aviation Corporation has dispatched 14 passenger planes to transport all the reception personnel. Departure may take place today.

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 3rd] In order to receive the grain agencies of the nine northeastern provinces, in addition to sending Liang Jingchun as a special commissioner to the Northeast, the Ministry of Food has recently sent seven more people to be responsible for receiving flour factories, soybean oil extraction plants, and grain processing plants. They are said to be waiting for a flight to Peiping and then to the Northeast.

### The Bizarre Kidnapping Case Masterminded by Kawashima Yoshiko: Nun Ando Details Her Kidnapping to Reporters

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] Kawashima Yoshiko's arrest in China has not yet been resolved, and the bizarre kidnapping case she masterminded is about to come to light. The kidnapped victim is Nun Ando, a 67-year-old abbess of the Five Hundred Arhat Temple built by overseas Chinese in the suburbs of Tokyo, and Kawashima Yoshiko is said to be a Qing Dynasty princess. Ando told reporters from the Central News Agency that Kawashima Yoshiko visited the temple in early 1941 and became friends with her a few days later. Kawashima once asked her to accept her as a disciple, but she was rejected because she refused to shave her head, smoke, and drink. In July of the same year, Kawashima came to the temple again with Dr. Tsuchiya and a nurse, and forced Ando to inject her with a drug that caused her to lose consciousness. She was then placed in an asylum and treated like a madman. When she protested solemnly, Tsuchiya gave her another injection. Ando said, "I knew the injection was usually used to end a person's life," and Ando still walks unsteadily with a paralyzed left leg. She was released after living in the asylum for two months, but she was almost dead. During those two months, Kawashima Yoshiko presided over the temple and lived in it. Ando also said: "Until now, I still can't understand Kawashima's reason for kidnapping me. Now that Tsuchiya is dead, the only person who can explain this strange behavior is Kawashima alone." Ando continued, "Kawashima Yoshiko is very beautiful and extremely vain." Ando was formerly a famous actress in Tokyo and later became the concubine of Count Katsura Taro, the Japanese Prime Minister during the Russo-Japanese War.

Editorial

### Doing Good is the Greatest Joy, Reading Books is the Best!

Today is the Start of Spring of this year. The whole year's planning lies in spring, and the whole day's planning lies in the morning. On this Start of Spring morning of this year, we would like to sincerely offer two old Chinese sayings that advise people to our readers, which are "Doing Good is the Greatest Joy, Reading Books is the Best."

Whenever the New Year arrives, the central government always says, "Congratulations on the New Year," what is called New Year, is a newly established happy and prosperous nation; even the old custom of, "Congratulations on Getting Rich," is nothing more than because getting rich is a sufficiently happy thing. Westerners also say "Happy Year" when celebrating the New Year, also wishing people happiness. It can be seen that happiness is the most important thing in life. However, while happiness is what everyone seeks, the way to truly obtain happiness differs from person to person. Getting rich is certainly enjoyable; but if one only knows how to accumulate wealth and does not know how to distribute it, then the result of getting rich may lead to one being enslaved by wealth, becoming a miser for life, which may not necessarily be happiness, and may even become the root of suffering in one's heart. Therefore, true happiness cannot be simply encompassed by the two words "getting rich," and there is another way to seek true happiness.

Extending this further, all the world's people, of all kinds, are the same with round heads and square feet, all have flesh and blood and spiritual intelligence, using one's own heart to measure the hearts of others, I certainly want to be happy, and others must also want to be happy, if one only knows how to seek one's own happiness, and does not care about the happiness of others, can one feel at ease? Is this morally right? Mencius said, "Enjoying alone is not as good as enjoying with everyone," the former is selfish, while the latter is public. Seeking one's own happiness, even if it comes true, while at the same time hearing and seeing are all poor and helpless, pitiful and pitiable things, how can one's heart be happy? Moreover, the most fearful thing in the world is inequality, and Heaven hates completeness even more. If we only seek personal fulfillment and sit idly by while our fellow humans are suffering, unmoved, such an unequal situation, over time, will make it so that even those of us who could have been happy cannot be happy. Moreover, today's China, with the initial arrival of victory, is scarred and full of wounds, how to deal with the aftermath, how to revive, from the small self and family, to the large nation and society, we need to recuperate and educate, redouble our efforts, and it is definitely not the time to live extravagantly and enjoy happiness. Therefore, to live truly happy days today, the only way is for everyone to put aside selfishness and quickly think of ways to reduce everyone's suffering and share happiness. In other words, only helping others can bring happiness. The more you help others, the more happiness you will have.

Article 10 of the Code of Conduct for Members of the Chinese Kuomintang: "Helping others is the source of happiness." This is truly a golden needle for navigating the world. "Helping others" is "doing good," which can be further interpreted as the saying "doing good deeds." The Boy Scout oath requires "doing a good deed every day," which also encourages everyone to do at least one good deed every day, to do something to help others. Mencius distinguishes between gentlemen and petty men, saying that gentlemen rise at dawn and diligently do good, while petty men diligently seek profit. In simpler terms, seeking profit is only for oneself, while doing good is only helping others. We want to advise those who seek happiness, do not think only of themselves at all times, on the contrary, they must always care about the suffering of others and help others solve their difficulties. Only by often being mindful of the suffering of others can we feel that we are better than those below but not as good as those above, and not be burdened by material desires, and our hearts will naturally be bright. Only by often saving people from danger and helping people in need, reducing the suffering of others and increasing their happiness, can we then reflect on ourselves in the quiet of the night, feel at ease and justified, and endless joy will arise spontaneously. Therefore, the old saying "Doing Good is the Greatest Joy" is absolutely correct. Everyone only knows how to seek happiness, but is unwilling to make efforts to "do good," which is even more dangerous than climbing a tree to catch fish, or may even inevitably suffer "later disasters" as Mencius said!

Secondly, let's talk about reading. Reading here does not mean reading books blindly, nor does it encourage people to read books solely for the purpose of becoming officials or getting rich. There are many reasons why people must read books, and the greatest hope lies in understanding principles. Reading without understanding principles is the same as not reading, or even worse than not reading. Of course, applying what one has learned is the purpose of our reading, but if one does not understand the principles of being a person, then what is the benefit to mankind and the world, even with profound knowledge? Article 11 of the Code of Conduct for Members of the Chinese Kuomintang: "Knowledge is the foundation for helping the world." Reading is for seeking knowledge, and seeking knowledge is for the purpose of helping the world. The so-called "world" is the world of mankind. The reason why the world is what it is today is due to the accumulation of human knowledge. We have received the gifts of the wise sages of past generations, and the gifts of contemporary visionaries and enlightened individuals. Born into this world, born in this China, how should we repay them to be without shame? Naturally, we must also do our best to contribute to the world, which is "helping the world"; and to be able to contribute, we must possess knowledge, and we must deeply understand principles, which requires reading. Therefore, reading is definitely not for becoming an official, nor is it for getting rich, but for the purpose of contributing to the world. Such reading is a good thing, so it is said that "Reading Books is the Best."

Some may think: there are many ways to contribute to the world, why must one read books? In ancient times, perhaps one could say so, but it is not appropriate to say so today. The modern world is a world of science, a scientific mass era. Regardless of agriculture, industry, or commerce, what kind of work does not require science? What kind of career does not require knowledge? Ultimately speaking, what kind of person does not need to read books? Those who read books have inventions and progress; those who do not read books stick to old ways and wait to be eliminated. The progress of human civilization has reached an era where all kinds of achievements cannot be made without reading and studying. Moreover, since it is called a scientific mass era, the civilization of a country is judged by the proportion of the population that reads books. If only a few people read books and the majority are illiterate, then the science of this country must still be backward, and the industry must still be corrupt, which is definitely not a "good" scene. Therefore, we not only hope that we ourselves read books, that our children read books, but also extend this to hope that everyone reads books, and that the children of every household have the opportunity to protect books. Eliminating illiteracy and having the whole country read books is truly great and especially great.

This Spring Festival, we will present the two old sayings "Doing Good is the Greatest Joy, Reading Books is the Best" to our readers, to the people, and especially to the wealthy and influential families. Jesus once said that it is harder for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, which was originally just an expression of anger. We believe that "rich and courteous" is not a unique occurrence. What wealthy families seek is nothing more than happiness, nothing more than good things. And they have the most opportunities to "do good," and the strongest ability to do good. As long as they have a good thought, the common people will benefit endlessly. Their children certainly do not worry about having no books to read, or perhaps only worry about having books but not wanting to read; but the general public wants to read but cannot, wants to seek knowledge but has no opportunity to seek it. Therefore, we believe that the fundraising campaign for student aid jointly called for by the Shanghai Education Association and this newspaper, etc., is a convenient door for wealthy people to seek happiness and good things. If Zhou Yixing uses his New Year's money to help students, it is a convenient example of doing good in the New Year. We hope that everyone will not miss this great opportunity to do good, and will not only let their own children have books to read, but also watch the clever and handsome children of other families miss the good opportunity to read. "Doing Good is the Greatest Joy, Reading Books is the Best." May everyone never forget! Advisor to MacArthur's Headquarters, Acheson, to Return to the US

### Reforming the Endorsement Procedures for Negotiable Instruments, Another New Method, the Bankers Association is Considering

[Reported by this newspaper] In the past, the financial community of this city had habits such as endorsing negotiable instruments for guarantee and affixing seals with "received in person" and "received as payment" on receipts, which had no legal basis, but had become a common practice due to long-standing difficulty in changing them. Now, the habit of guaranteeing endorsements on negotiable instruments has been explicitly abolished by the Ministry of Finance. As for other procedures related to the handling of negotiable instruments, the Four Banks Joint Treasury has also formulated methods, all based on the principle of conforming to the Negotiable Instruments Law. The Greater Rear Area implemented them long ago, and this city should also follow suit. The Reorganization Committee of the Bankers Association of this city, in view of this, entrusted the Bankers' Association to study specific methods. After referring to the principles of the Ministry's order and the methods of the Four Banks Joint Treasury, it formulated two types: "Measures for the Receipt and Payment Handling of Negotiable Instruments and Payment Receipts by Various Banks and Firms" and "Measures for Endorsing Checks". According to these measures, the

important regulations include: (1) Checks currently in use that contain the name or title of the payee are considered registered checks, regardless of whether the words "or bearer" or "holder" have been crossed out. Checks that do not contain the name or title of the payee are considered unregistered checks, regardless of whether the words "or bearer" or "holder" have been crossed out, and the holder of the check should be considered the payee. Checks printed in the future will no longer include the words "or bearer" or "holder". (2) The paying bank or firm is not legally responsible for verifying the authenticity of the payee's endorsement on a registered check, or whether the holder of the check is the payee himself. The habit of guaranteeing endorsements by collecting banks in the past should be abolished. (3) The text or signature of the check endorsement must

completely match the payee's name on the check, otherwise the issuer must correct the payee's name on the face of the check and sign or seal at the correction site. This era-defining reform reverses the accumulated habits of the past several decades. It is now heard that the Bankers Association is considering implementing it, and the Central Bank, Exchange, Money Shops, Trust Companies, and Foreign Banks will all handle it in unison.

The remaining one-third are corps members of the various sub-groups under the branch corps. The camp adopts a military management system, and the young people undergoing training are organized into a large team. The training curriculum focuses on recreational activities, and also includes lectures on political corps affairs, to supplement the deficiencies of school education. The time is set for two weeks. The director is concurrently held by Wu Shaoshu, the director of the branch corps, and the deputy directors are Wang Weijun and Xie Dahuang. The Shanghai, Nanjing, and Jiangsu branches of the corps will hold a joint meeting in Nanjing on the 10th. Each branch will send ten people, including cadre team leaders, to participate.

### Luo Xulai Scores an Own Goal to Treat Guests, Qingbai Win a Narrow Victory Against Yiqiao, Result: 1-0

Yesterday's football league match between Qingbai and Yiqiao attracted a large number of spectators. The stadium was already crowded with people before 2:00 PM, with hardly any room to stand. Most of the spectators were crowded behind, unable to see the whole picture, only able to see vaguely. As a result, Qingbai narrowly defeated Yiqiao with a score of 1-0. There were no goals in the first half.

The game was intensely fierce throughout. Li Yichen of Qingbai, who got the ball, was closely guarded by the opponent, making him unable to use his skills.

### Lamp Whispers

— Sudan

At midnight, before the dim lamp, the sound of the Xiao flute rhythmically marks the passing of time, and I am silent.

Although I have weary eyes, I am reading an old letter. Who would have thought that I would reread a five-year-old letter tonight? For the sake of this letter, to say just one sentence: a hard life in deep mountains and valleys is not suitable for girls. Just this one sentence hurt a friend's self-esteem, and I lost this friend's sincere friendship. Who would have imagined that?

I am a clumsy child. I should thank this friend for their frankness. If they hadn't said it, I wouldn't have known that I had made others resentful. But now that I know, I feel some unspeakable sadness. My heart gradually becomes heavy, and I begin to understand melancholy.

Can a tiny grain of sand leave a permanent crack on the soul? Then tell me, are humans born for love or for hate? Although the night is chilly, I warm myself with precious memories, but the rumination of emotions is a painful thing. Now I am chewing on past feelings, letting my heart suffer the torment of bygone events.

I have never considered myself more noble than others, nor have I considered others lower than myself. I do not understand hypocrisy or lies, so I have no regrets. I know that being understood by others is as difficult as understanding others. Why do people build an invisible wall between themselves?

Because it is easy to lose a friend, I feel how difficult it is to gain one. I regret the loss of sincere friendship. I met this friend in my childhood. Young children all have pure hearts, without a trace of falsehood. Only at this time is the distance between people the closest. But time quietly flows away, and now I know that a single sentence can leave a shadow in someone's heart.

I said that I have no regrets because I have never despised a friend, whether close or distant. I believe Mlle de Scudery's words: only friendship is the only thornless rose in the world. Friendship needs to be maintained with sincerity. I do not wish that a kind word is misunderstood as ridicule. I cherish the thornless rose, and I respect every one of my friends.

Because of an old letter, in this cold winter season, under the lamp late at night, I silently write down some whispers. I feel a little cold and a little melancholy.

Long nights have dawn, and cold winters have an end, but what about a misunderstanding?

### A Record of the Gathering Ferns Painting

— Shi Chongpeng

My teacher, Mr. Xiao Wuquan, is over eighty years old, full of vigor, with a dignified appearance. He is skilled in calligraphy and painting, especially in landscape painting, and is well-known at home and abroad. For more than fifty years, he has thrived in the contemporary art scene. He is of upright character and once taught at Liangjiang Normal School, where he was appreciated by He Daozhou and was close friends with Li Ruiqing and Zhu Guwei. His brushstrokes are vigorous and profound, and the artistic conception is deep and distant, which cannot be matched by today's famous artists. The Qing Dynasty Painting History published by Youzheng Bookstore praises him as "his paintings pursue the Song and Yuan Dynasties, taking nature as his teacher," which is by no means an exaggeration. Mr. Xiao once created a horizontal scroll painting titled "Gathering Ferns" for the Cao Qingzhen brothers. It is about one foot high and two feet wide, painted in light ochre. The landscape serves as the background, and there are two figures, dignified in bearing and elegant in demeanor. Boyi leans on a cane, and Shuqi holds a basket, gazing between the mountains and rivers, detached from the crowd. Across the bank, the green hills are faintly visible, the trees are lush, and the sound of water gurgles, cascading between the two peaks, which is extremely vivid. Lu You's lines, "The stream turns, the silk reels the flat dyke water, the forest lacks, the green separates the distant mountains," seem to be written for this painting. My teacher uses his masterful brush to write this horizontal scroll, and the grand momentum and skillful ease are clearly visible. He inscribed a seven-character quatrain on it, "A generation of pure reputation belongs to the Da Xiao, the brothers follow the ancients as their teachers; the ferns of the Western Mountains can still be gathered, writing the second picture of Yi and Qi." It is said that the Cao brothers were both granted the title of Jinshi and served as editors in the Hanlin Academy, and their character was extremely noble. My teacher regarded them as confidants. Although he usually did not inscribe poems on paintings, he now happily took up the brush, which was by no means accidental and is also a beautiful story in the art world.

### Theory and Practice

— Zhongyi

Theory is the method of practice, and practice is the purpose of theory. If there is theory without practice, then theory is no different from a bounced check. If there is practice without theory, then practice will inevitably lack "any method or rules." Without both theory and practice, one is stuck in their ways. Only correct theory combined with an indomitable spirit of practice can produce satisfactory results and promote continuous progress.

We can notice that the most common problem that humans suffer from is not "having practice without theory" or "having neither practice nor theory," but rather "having both theory and practice, but failing to integrate the two into one" – in other words, theory is theory, and practice is practice; what is practiced is not theory, and what is theorized has no hope of being practiced! Therefore, wanting to progress is like climbing a tree to catch a fish!

Let's take a few examples that everyone has observed. You must have seen the words "Standing on the platform is prohibited" on the tram. Usually, you see these words when you feel extremely crowded, but if you have the opportunity to go deep into the carriage, you will be surprised to find that it is quite spacious inside. If we calculate the population density, the platform sometimes exceeds the depth of the carriage by more than double. Just imagine, the density of the place where "standing is prohibited" exceeds the density of the place where "standing is permitted" and "should be standing" by double, then isn't the distance between theory and practice far enough?

"No posting" signs are also quite familiar. As a rule, "no posting" should mean no "posting," but you can often find many advertisements "posted" near the "no posting" signs. The colors of these advertisements are very bright, and the area of the paper is very large, so they are much more eye-catching than the "no posting" signs themselves!

Furthermore, places where "No urination, offenders will be arrested" are written at the entrance of small alleys are often specially set-up open-air toilets. There are also examples such as "smoking cessation centers" with signs hanging outside, while inside they are "dens of pleasure," and so on! Moreover, the above are just shallow and easily visible examples. If we extend it to larger and more serious events, similar examples are also commonly found, but this is left for you to observe and think about for yourselves.
