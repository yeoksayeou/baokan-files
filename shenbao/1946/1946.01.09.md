### Three-Person Committee's Second Meeting; Ceasefire Order to Be Issued Within Days

[Our Own Dispatch] San Francisco, 8th, Midnight Broadcast: After attending the Three-Person Committee meeting today, Marshall declared: "The ceasefire" order can be issued within the next few days.

[United Press, Chongqing, 8th] After a three-hour meeting this morning, the Three-Person Committee failed to reach an agreement on issuing a "ceasefire" order and will hold a second meeting tonight. Although some people feel disappointed, participants seemed quite optimistic when the morning meeting ended at 1:00 AM. U.S. President's Special Envoy to China, General Marshall, chaired the meeting. He seemed to be in good spirits when he exited the meeting room, but he declined to make any comments except to inform the correspondents that they should not expect any public announcement today. Zhang Qun, the representative of the National Government, told Chinese reporters that he believed the government's "ceasefire" order would be issued before the first meeting of the Political Consultative Conference on January 10th. Communist representative Zhou Enlai told Chinese reporters that the Communist Party's "ceasefire" order might be issued "in two or three days." Today's second meeting will be held at 4:30 PM (Chongqing time, 5:30 PM Shanghai time). It is widely believed that the scope of discussion will include the following four key points: (1) the "ceasefire" formula; (2) the restoration of transportation; (3) the acceptance of the surrender of Japanese troops in the Communist-controlled areas; (4) the repatriation of Japanese troops to their home country. While the Three-Person Committee is studying these issues, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, one of the government representatives at the Political Consultative Conference, suggested that both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party should simultaneously "cease fire" in the propaganda war and on the front lines. Wang stated that he believed that mutual attacks between the two parties would be detrimental to the negotiations. Lu Dingyi, Director of Propaganda for the Communist Party (and also a member of the Political Consultative Conference), agreed with this point at today's preparatory meeting of the Political Consultative Conference.

Wang Hansheng chaired the meeting. Wang immediately proposed six points regarding the current Northeastern issue on behalf of the 40 million compatriots in the nine provinces and two cities of the Northeast: (1) The Northeast should have the same administrative institutions as other provinces and cities in China. (2) Military power in the Northeast should be vested in the Central Government. (3) The Northeastern economy should be absolutely open, and the exploitation of resources should be especially open. (4) Oppose the specialization of the Northeast. He also stated that the Northeast had suffered terribly under enemy occupation for fourteen years and urgently hoped that the central government would send personnel to the Northeast to complete the handover work as soon as possible, and further hoped that the National Army would quickly go to the Northeast to take over defense and restore local order. During the meeting, Shao Lizi, Yu Jiaju, Wang Yunwu, Hu Lin, Liang Shuming, and others were invited to speak in turn. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.

[Another Dispatch] Six organizations of Northeastern natives in Chongqing issued a written opinion on the current situation in the Northeast, stating: Since the September 18th Incident, our Northeastern people have been ravaged by the enemy for fourteen years. The suffering during that time is beyond words. We were celebrating the victory of the War of Resistance and expecting peace, but unexpectedly, the actual situation has taken a turn for the worse. Almost all areas of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Chahar are engulfed in flames of war, transportation is destroyed, factories are demolished, young and strong people are coerced, and the old and young fill the ravines. These unfortunate events are being reenacted in the Northeast, plunging our 40 million compatriots into deep waters. Now that the Political Consultative Conference is about to be convened, we stand on the position of the people and must declare the Northeastern people's views on the current situation in the Northeast: (1) The Northeast is a part of Chinese territory, and the people of the Northeast are one with the Chinese nation. There is no difference compared to the inland provinces. Recently, there have been talks of specialization. We solemnly declare that the handling of issues related to the Northeast should be the same as in other provinces. We firmly oppose all special measures. (2) If the Communist army violates the will of the people, it will be abandoned by the Northeastern people. (3) The people of the Northeast deeply hope that the country will be peacefully unified, that constitutional government will be implemented as soon as possible, and that democratic politics will be completed. (4) Our Northeastern people have suffered from the enemy's poison for fourteen years. After much painful reflection, we urgently hope that the government will complete the handover work as soon as possible, promptly establish popular representative bodies, and promote local autonomy as the foundation for constitutional government.

[Our Own Dispatch, Nanjing, 8th] Although the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration has recently increased the number of passenger trains and added passenger cars on the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, and Pukou-Xuzhou lines under its jurisdiction, passengers are still extremely crowded.

Before redividing the country into five or even seven pacification zones, the Army Headquarters will convene the original commanders of each war zone in the near future to review the two major issues of military reorganization and pacification. It seems likely that this will happen after Bai returns from his inspection tour. Gu Zhutong flew back to Xuzhou yesterday afternoon. Li Pinxian will stay in Nanjing for another day or two. Since Bai came to Nanjing, he has taken two excursions to the suburbs and inspected the urban area for a week. Citizens who saw Bai said that his demeanor was as heroic and spirited as ever.

### Communist Troops Retreat Near Taixian; Communist Troops in Shanxi Province Conscript Soldiers and Forcibly Demand Grain and Cloth

[Our Own Dispatch, Nanjing, 8th] By telephone from Yangzhou, some of the Communist troops near Taixian have retreated.

### President Chiang Cables Orders That Recovered Areas Should Treat Primary and Secondary School Education Well; Those Few Who Collaborated with the Enemy Should Be Handled with Caution

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 8th] President Chiang instructed Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin to forward the following order, roughly stating that the principals and teachers of primary and secondary schools in the occupied areas were mostly loyal individuals, and those few who willingly collaborated with the enemy should be thoroughly investigated and handled with caution: During the War of Resistance, the principals and teachers of primary and secondary schools in the occupied areas were mostly loyal and patriotic, did not forget national righteousness, persuaded and educated, and maintained the morale of the people. Now that our government has been restored, we should effectively protect and treat these primary and secondary school teachers well. Among them, if there are very few bad elements who willingly colluded with the enemy and whose actions are clearly revealed, we should also ascertain the facts and handle them with caution, without any discrimination. We should also strictly prevent revenge under the pretext of eliminating the government's ultimate intention to reward loyalty. It is hoped that you will forward this order to the responsible military and local party and government personnel in the recovered areas for implementation.

### President Chiang Issues Order to Prevent Forcible Detention of Returning Ships

### Student Unrest in Nanjing Resolved

Students Who Caused Trouble Will Be Punished

[Our Own Dispatch, Nanjing, 8th] A group of students from the Nanjing Provisional University Preparatory Class who had previously studied at the Puppet Central University caused trouble on the 6th because they were dissatisfied with the English placement test and public expenses and dormitory issues, injuring the class director Wang Shulin.

The students of the class requested Mayor Ma to mediate and restore classes yesterday and today.

He urged them to apologize to Director Wang as soon as possible so that classes could be restored. Wang Shulin is still in the hospital. The society is mostly disappointed that the students who caused trouble did not appreciate the government's hard work in establishing the Provisional University Preparatory Class.

Editorial

### On the U.S. Cotton Loan

The American cotton loan to China from the United States totals $33 million, enough to purchase 300,000 bales of American cotton, sufficient for one year's use in our country. Although all the details are still to be agreed upon, there should be no major changes. From this news, we should understand: (1) The textile industry, whether government-run or privately-run, although proceeding simultaneously, still has a large shortage of its main raw material, cotton. (2) It is necessary to purchase foreign cotton to compensate for the shortage, but there is a lack of foreign exchange. (3) When foreign businesses want to promote the sale of their goods in China, they must also provide loans at the same time. At the same time, it is reported that the Minsheng Company is purchasing ships from the United States, and the United States has also agreed to provide a loan of $15 million. In comparison, the true nature of this situation becomes even clearer.

Originally, it is said that China's unfrozen funds in the United States amount to only $350 million. This amount is not even enough to cover one year's payments for imports from the United States under normal circumstances. If there are no other sources to offset international receipts and payments, then it is equivalent to fighting with bare hands. No matter how urgent the need for foreign materials is, it is still something that can be hoped for but not attained.

At present, in the minds of most people, a large post-war loan seems inevitable. Moreover, President Truman has also clearly stated in his announced China policy that this matter can be discussed. Therefore, it seems that only seeking a sufficient import of goods is important, and other matters can be dealt with later. However, it is not known that the big loan is still just a pie in the sky at present, and it cannot be expected too much in the short term. The Americans also understand this very well, so they are addressing what is most urgent and first provide piecemeal solutions to cope with the current situation. Moreover, even if the large loan is secured, it will not be a long-term solution if there are no other sources to offset it. The foreign exchange rate that everyone is watching has not been announced to this day. Although there are many issues involved, the foreign exchange issue is undoubtedly one of them.

To solve this problem, it is actually very simple. From a superficial perspective, whether solving it as a whole or piecemeal, it ultimately comes down to borrowing. From a fundamental perspective, however, it is necessary to start with promoting export trade. China's foreign exchange funds, apart from remittances from overseas Chinese and foreign public and private funds, which account for a small part, mostly rely on export goods.

Some people believe that because foreign communication has been cut off for a long time, various countries have a great need for China's native products. As long as the foreign exchange and shipping problems can be solved, the future of the export business is very promising. This may be partly true. Why? Although the foreign appetite is very good, after the wars, there are scars everywhere, and the output of various native products is far less than before. For example, the silk industry in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas will inevitably feel unable to recover in the short term because too many mulberry fields have been destroyed. The same is true for other products such as tung oil and tea. Moreover, after the restoration, many areas in the interior have not fully restored their security, transportation, and finance. So, how can the production industry recover quickly?

Therefore, when talking about international trade, one cannot help but think of domestic trade: when talking about domestic trade, one cannot help but think of political issues. Any party, any class, if they believe that the interests of the country and the nation are above all else and are supreme, then they should abandon private prejudices and first quickly restore transportation, stabilize order, and then revive industry and increase foreign trade.

### Consul General Jiang Jiadong Stationed in Java Heads to Batavia to Assume Post. Our Military Officer Detained in Kuala Lumpur and Injured by British Troops; We Have Demanded Compensation, Punishment, Apology, etc.

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 8th] China's new Consul General to Java, Jiang Jiadong, left here tonight for Batavia to assume his post. In addition, Chen Jiageng has requested that the British authorities take effective steps to stop the anti-Chinese actions of Malaysians in Kuala Lumpur, northern Malaya. In the past six weeks, seven overseas Chinese have been killed, hundreds have been injured, three homes have been burned down, and 26 homes have been robbed. There are 500,000 Malaysians and only 25,000 overseas Chinese.

[Central News Agency, Kuala Lumpur, 6th] An unfortunate incident occurred here on the afternoon of January 3rd. 136 of our soldiers, including two liaison officers, were injured by British military police and troops. Our side has made four demands to British Liaison Officer Lieutenant Colonel Fening: (1) Return the weapons, (2) Compensate for the losses, (3) Punish the responsible officers, (4) Publicly apologize in the newspapers. The British side has accepted the first demand, and the other three demands will be answered tomorrow. Our military officer told reporters: Unless the four demands are fully complied with, our side will take legal action. At the same time, all the facts have been notified to the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Kuala Lumpur branch of the Kuomintang, both of which have promised to convene a meeting of all local Chinese organizations to discuss countermeasures if the four demands are not fully answered. According to our military officer, the incident occurred on the afternoon of the 3rd. Our military liaison officer Zhang Wensen (transliteration), fully armed, parked his car outside the Lakes Hotel where they were staying. A British military officer and a Dutch military officer also drove a car. The British officer ordered our military officer to drive to the police station for no reason. Zhang refused and cut off the car's power supply, making it unable to move. The British officer ordered the Dutch officer to point a gun at Zhang, and he summoned more than 30 military police, 50 policemen, and some soldiers, who rushed towards a small number of our military officers, attempting to disarm our side. During the conflict, two of our military officers were seriously injured in the head by gun butts. The British military police surrounded the hotel rooms where our troops were staying, taking away guns, uniforms, watches, and fountain pens, and even money. At that time, British liaison officers Lieutenant Colonels Fening and Colbeck were both present, but failed to stop it. At the time of the incident, most of the 56 officers were out for dinner. Our officers are gathered here waiting for transportation back to the country. Since the Japanese surrender, they have been requesting to be sent back to the country, but they have not yet obtained transportation for some reason.

### The Problem of the Existence of the China-India Highway Has Not Yet Been Finally Decided; There Are Also Three Rumors About the Future of the Pipeline

[This newspaper's Kunming, 8th] The problem of the existence or abolition of the China-India Highway and the China-India Pipeline is a matter of great concern to the general public here, but so far there has been no final concrete decision. The Bomi Highway in the China-India Highway has in fact been abandoned, because the Bomi Highway has not reached the original standard, and after the victory of the War of Resistance, the existence of the road is not welcomed by a certain country. The Road Bureau once planned to use its own radio station in Myitkyina, but it was also prohibited by a certain party. This wartime highway built with the blood and sweat of Chinese and American people will become a historical name. As for the future of the China-India oil pipeline, there are three rumors here: (1) Dismantle and transfer all the equipment to the Gansu Oil Mine Bureau to install the pipeline. The most difficult part of this project is the transportation problem, followed by the lack of funds. It is estimated that it will require 100 million yuan. This was one of the initial plans of the China-India Oil Pipeline Engineering Office. Now, according to a senior official of the office, this matter may be difficult to achieve. (2) The China-India oil pipeline will be taken over by American businessmen. It is rumored that the Asia, Texaco, and Mobil Oil Companies are currently negotiating with our government in Chongqing. If it can be resolved quickly, it is expected that oil can be transported in February. (3) Continue to maintain the status quo, neither resuming oil transportation in the short term nor abandoning it, and wait for the decision of the Chinese and American governments. Director Guo is still in Chongqing, seeking instructions from relevant parties on the aftermath of the pipeline. The personnel of the Pipeline Engineering Office are still continuing to work. As of today, they have not received any orders to end or other orders.

After arriving here, US Secretary of State Byrnes told reporters: The atomic bomb issue will be one of the central issues to be discussed at the General Assembly, but we must pay attention to the fact that the General Assembly will discuss its control methods, not its production methods.

[Reuters, London, 8th] The plenary session of the United Nations organization is scheduled to be held here this Thursday. A ten-person working committee is currently engaged in the final preparations, organizing the agenda of the General Assembly. Half of the representatives of various countries have arrived in London by sea and air from all over the world. It is estimated that the total number of representatives from 51 countries will be more than 2,000.

[United Press, Chongqing, 8th] Foreign Minister Wang was originally scheduled to represent China at the United Nations General Assembly, but because the Political Consultative Conference will open on the 10th, he will not be able to go to London.

[United Press, London, 8th] The US delegation to the United Nations General Assembly will discuss the stance to be taken on the atomic energy resolution after Byrnes arrives in London. It is said that Byrnes has been notified that some members of the US delegation believe that the resolution should be revised. If the US delegation cannot reach a consensus, it will cause a serious situation, but most officials are optimistic and believe that the issue can be resolved. Byrnes must have a clear plan for this issue and hopes to avoid an internal "crisis" in the United States.

### US Delegation Establishes Five-Person Committee; Atomic Energy Issue is Safeguarded

[United Press, Washington, 8th] Before departing for London yesterday, the US Secretary of State issued a declaration guaranteeing that Congress will retain the final say on any action by the United States to transfer atomic energy knowledge to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. He also announced the establishment of a five-person committee, chaired by Deputy Secretary of State Acheson, with members including former Assistant Secretary of State McCloy, Dr. Bush, an expert on US supervision and development of atomic energy, Dr. Conant, and Major General Groves, to study the necessary controls and safeguards so that the American people can understand how the United Nations Commission will proceed when it begins its mission. Byrnes also said that the United Nations Commission is concerned not with how atomic energy is produced, but with how it can be controlled for peaceful purposes.

[United Press, Washington, 8th] After arriving in London, Secretary of State Byrnes will convene a meeting of the US delegation to the General Assembly to provide them with assurances on the issue of atomic energy control, just as he assured the country. Byrnes stated yesterday to the people at home and abroad: (1) The atomic energy commission to be organized in the future will not have the right to demand scientific information that the United States is unwilling to provide. (2) The United States may use its veto power to prevent the United Nations Security Council from attempting to obtain this information. (3) If the commission passes a resolution promoting the exchange of this information with the consent of the United States, the final decision on whether the United States participates rests with Congress.

[Central News Agency, London, 7th special telegram] The selection of US representatives to the main committees of the United Nations General Assembly has been announced: Conant will attend the First Committee on Political and Security Affairs, White will attend the Second Committee on Economic and Financial Affairs, Mrs. Roosevelt will attend the Third Committee on Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Affairs, Townsend will attend the Fourth Committee on Trusteeship Affairs, Dulles will attend the Fifth Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Affairs, and Vandenberg will attend the Sixth Committee on Legal Affairs.

### The Iranian Issue Will Not Be Placed on the Agenda; It Will Be Handled by a Three-Country Committee

[Reuters, Washington, 8th] A State Department spokesman revealed yesterday: The Iranian Embassy in the United States informed Stettinius, the chief US representative to the United Nations General Assembly, that the Iranian government does not intend to place the Iranian-Soviet dispute on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly in order to continue its efforts to establish a three-country committee.

[United Press, 8th, London] The first issue facing the US delegation concerns the voting election of the President of the General Assembly, the Secretary-General, and the non-permanent members of the Security Council. It is widely believed that the US delegation supports a representative from an Eastern European country to serve as Secretary-General, most likely one of the three: Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, Dutch Kleffens, or Norwegian Foreign Minister Lie. If the Soviet Union insists that the post of Secretary-General must be held by a European, then the United States will support the nomination of Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk. If a stalemate develops between Eastern and Western European countries, the United States will propose Canadian Ambassador to the United States Pearson as a compromise. The United States' proposed non-permanent members of the Security Council include Brazil from South America and Mexico from Central America. It is expected that Egypt will win a seat representing Central Africa and East Africa, and Canada and Australia will represent the autonomous territories and the Far East.

### Our Representatives in the United States Inspect Highway System

[United Press, Chicago, 8th] China hopes to build 300,000 li of new highways, the same as those in the United States. Three representatives from the China Highway Bureau are currently in the United States to inspect the highway system, traffic management, vehicle licensing, and methods to reduce accidents. These three are all graduates of Chongqing Jiaotong University and are working in the Highway Bureau. It is said that China hopes to obtain US$72 million from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to purchase 310,000 materials for road construction, and hopes to have 300,000 cars in five years, shuttling back and forth on the newly built highways. Wei, a world-renowned traffic expert from the US Safety Committee, is currently assisting the three representatives in studying traffic safety laws. One of the goals is to eliminate the threat of "city tigers." The so-called "city tiger" refers to drivers who drive recklessly. According to the conclusions of the Chinese delegation's inspection, Chinese car drivers need a licensing and driving record system. In addition, it is planned to educate tens of thousands of new drivers who use the highway, starting with publicity, notices, and radio broadcasts. During the inspection of American highways, the Chinese representatives discovered a safety device, namely reflective highway warning signs, which are indispensable on Chinese highways.

### At least Six Belligerent Members of the Japanese Cabinet Will Be Removed from Office; Third Meeting Held Yesterday, but Still No Result; Rumors that Shidehara Will Automatically Retire After the General Election

[Our Tokyo Correspondent, 8th] The Japanese Cabinet convened its third meeting today regarding the issue of cabinet resignation, which will still be left to Shidehara's decision. However, the exact date of Shidehara's recovery and return to duty remains unknown. Some say that the government is deliberately employing delaying tactics to alleviate external pressure. Chief Cabinet Secretary Tsuda stated that no decision could be made until Shidehara returns to office. Yesterday, there were reports that Foreign Minister Yoshida would visit MacArthur for instructions, but this had not materialized by this afternoon. Allied officials believe that this matter should be resolved by the Japanese themselves to test whether they can make a constructive decision. It is now known that at least six members of the cabinet will be removed from office, but Shidehara still hopes to avoid the calamity of a general cabinet resignation.

[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] According to today's news, Prime Minister Shidehara, acting on MacArthur's directive to purge all individuals in public office who had some connection with the military, is reportedly prepared to dismiss at least six cabinet members. However, if the cabinet decides to resign en masse, he has decided to recommend a successor for the position of prime minister. The initial panic caused by the issuance of the directive seems to have subsided. According to various sources, Shidehara intends to form some form of coalition government after dismissing the cabinet members named on the blacklist. The six cabinet members expected to be dismissed are: Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Kenzo Matsumura, Minister of Home Affairs Zennosuke Horikiri, Minister of State Daizaburo Tsuda, Minister of Education Maeda, Minister of Communications Yoshio Tanaka, and Minister of State Matsutani Haji. To fill these positions, it is reported that Shidehara is preparing to select candidates for ministers from various political parties and the public in order to form a new coalition government. During this transitional period, the government will prepare for the general election. Once the election is over, the government will automatically retire. Shidehara stated that if this fails, he will resign jointly with the cabinet. In addition, he will advise the Emperor on possible successors to set a precedent. Previously, the Emperor often consulted the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, who convened a meeting of the Elder Statesmen and the President of the Privy Council to determine the new prime minister. Now that the position of Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal has been abolished, the Emperor may have to seek the advice of the resigning prime minister, who, after holding a meeting with the President of the Privy Council and the speakers of both houses of parliament, will then recommend another candidate. Another complicated matter is that after deciding on a candidate, the Emperor must submit the list to the Allied Headquarters. If the latter does not approve, new candidates must be sought. Some observers believe that Shidehara's decision on the issue of a successor shows that he is not ignoring the great possibility of a general cabinet resignation.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch] The opinion that the Shidehara Cabinet should resign en masse is now gaining momentum. The cabinet ministers (excluding the ailing Prime Minister Shidehara) met again this morning to discuss MacArthur's purge directive. During informal exchanges of views, most cabinet ministers expressed that if MacArthur's directive is faithfully implemented, the cabinet will undergo a large-scale reorganization. This is virtually equivalent to forming a new government.

Purging Belligerent Elements Requires Considerable Time

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 8th] The major items discussed in today's cabinet meeting included two edicts that were provisionally approved yesterday, formally announcing MacArthur's directives, one banning right-wing groups and the other prohibiting ultranationalists from holding public office. Tsuda also stated that these directives are extremely difficult to implement and will require a considerable amount of time. Since MacArthur Headquarters has not specified a deadline, this point should be approved. Simply investigating the activities of government officials during the war to determine whether they supported militarism will take two or three months to collect reports. Therefore, key officials will be dismissed first, followed by secondary bureaucrats. The government plans to issue certificates to those who are impartial and clean in the upcoming election and can participate in the election. Generally speaking, due to the large number of people, the government will individually identify them after they announce their candidacy to see if they are qualified. The text of the directive has been published so that candidates can "judge themselves" in advance, he said.

### British Scientist Claims Soviet Union Invented New Atomic Bomb, Making British and American Atomic Bombs Pale in Comparison

[Associated Press, London, Terri 8th] British scientist Dr. Anberto announced today that the Soviet Union has invented a new type of atomic bomb, and British and American atomic bombs pale in comparison. The Soviet atomic bomb can also be produced on a large scale. Its shape is about the size of a tennis ball, and its explosive force can reach 56 miles horizontally and 6.2 miles vertically. The heat emitted can reach millions of degrees Celsius. The destructive power of British and American atomic bombs is determined by oil atoms, while the Soviet atomic bomb generates power through rotation or angular movement, which is more suitable for engineering applications.

[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] Atomic bomb experts here today were unwilling to directly criticize Dr. Anberto's claim that the Soviet Union had invented the latest atomic bomb, only saying that according to recent evidence, even if other countries obtained the knowledge of atomic energy currently possessed by the United States and then manufactured atomic bombs, it would take years to succeed.

[Associated Press, New York, 8th] British scientist Anberto Chuanshi claimed that the Soviet Union has invented a new type of atomic bomb, making British and American atomic bombs pale in comparison. According to a criticism in the New York Forum News by Dr. Weskopf, an atomic bomb expert at Cambridge University, the claim that the Soviet Union invented this bomb is absurd, because it is absolutely impossible to generate a large amount of heat from a small amount of uranium.

### Tomoyuki Yamashita Requests Trial in Civilian Court, Prosecutor Opposes Retrial

[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th Dispatch] Tomoyuki Yamashita, who was sentenced to death by hanging, today asked the U.S. Supreme Court to transfer the case to a civil court for trial. Yamashita's lawyers have submitted to the Supreme Court a request stating that his troops did not commit any criminal acts. Yamashita's defense lawyers claim that this convicted war criminal has the same legal rights as all human beings under the control of U.S. government agencies. However, the government prosecutor refuted Yamashita's attempt to have the Supreme Court hear the case, stating that Yamashita could not enjoy the right to be tried by a U.S. court during wartime and still insisted that the U.S. military commission had the power to try Yamashita for violating the laws of war. The legal question raised by this case is whether the power of military tribunals ceases with the cessation of war or the end of the war. Yamashita's defense lawyers expressed regret over the U.S. military commission's claim that Yamashita's case could be tried by a military tribunal or an international tribunal. The government prosecutor announced that if war criminals were tried by civil courts, it could ultimately lose its judicial function. According to the U.S. government, the debate will end tomorrow.

### Students Cause Trouble at the Capital Temporary University, Head Teacher Wang Shulin Injured, Ministry of Education Decides to Deal with it Severely

[Our Nanjing Special Report] The temporary training class of the University run by the Ministry of Education in Beijing has more than 2,000 students. Among them, some students, that is, more than 200 students who previously studied at the fake Central University, because the class held a grading test:

Students Request Public Disclosure of Test Papers

When the English course, which was proctored by female English professor Yu Da, was completed, they demanded that all the test papers be made public. The school believed that since the assessment of grades was the responsibility of the professor and there was an administrative system, it was not appropriate to comply with the students' requests in everything. Unexpectedly, more than 200 of the students in the class, the so-called 121 Student Association (students of the fake Central University who reorganized the student association on December 1), surrounded Director Wang Shulin in the class at around 10 am on the 6th of this month, demanding that the test papers be made public but failing.

Skull Smashes Director's Glasses

They smashed the skull in the specimen room, broke Wang's glasses, injured his left eye, broke the skin and caused bleeding, punched him in the waist, and surrounded him to petition the Ministry of Education. It happened to be Sunday, and the Ministry of Education was not working. Hundreds of students waited in the Ministry of Education's reception, supervisors, and councillors' conference rooms until late at night. Vice Minister Hang Liwu rushed to the scene after hearing the news and managed to free Director Wang Shulin, sending Wang to Gulou Hospital for treatment. The students dispersed at midnight. Wang is taking leave for medical treatment.

Vice Minister Calls Students for Admonishment

The Ministry of Education sent Huang Rujin, Director of the Social Education Department, to the temporary training class of the University to maintain teaching affairs.

### Executive Yuan Formulates Regulations Forcing Children to Attend School

[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing News] Forcing school-age children to attend school is an important measure of my country's post-war education policy. The Executive Yuan recently formulated the "Revised Regulations on Compulsory Education", which ordered the implementation of the national system. It stipulates that each township shall establish a "Township Compulsory Education Committee", which shall be organized by the township chief, the head of the cultural section of the township office, the principals of the township central national school and national schools, and representatives of the township citizens, with the township chief as the director.

### Education Loan Committee Calls for Enthusiastic Donations

[Our City News] The person in charge of the Shanghai Education Loan Committee said: The Loan Committee launched teachers and students from various schools to help solicit donations, mainly to encourage students to help themselves and others, and has repeatedly notified that donations should only be solicited from parents and relatives. However, people from all walks of life seem to lack a deep understanding of the importance of helping students who have dropped out of school, so the number of people who automatically donate is very small. Before the start of the donation, the committee had submitted it to the competent authority for record. The donation books held by each student are printed and distributed by each school, and it is stipulated that the principals of each school should check the fees against the books, collect them and submit them to the bank designated by the committee. The donors have donation receipts from the school, and their titles have been reported to the committee by the school, and the committee distributes the National News Two radio stations for broadcasting to show their trust. At present, at least 10,000 young people in the city urgently need tuition subsidies (the students subsidized this semester are based on the Xin Xin Er Bao, reaching more than 7,000 people, and the number of people who are subsidized by various groups and hold Xiangyu must be considerable). In the next semester, the tuition fees of various private schools average 15,000 yuan per student. To subsidize 10,000 young people, it is necessary to raise 150 million yuan in legal tender. The initial goal of the committee to raise donations was 100 million yuan, but so far, the amount obtained is less than 15 million yuan, which is far from the goal. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will rise up to sponsor, so that outstanding young people in Qinghan and poor teachers in the city will benefit from it.

### Moscow University Gives Preferential Treatment to Students Who Became Blind During the War

The special committee of the Trade Union takes care of all their urgent needs. Textbooks are the most important problem, because there are very few textbooks for blind people in higher schools, and special reference books are completely unavailable. To remedy this shortcoming, Moscow University has assigned special "readers" to help blind students.

### Basketball Friendly Match South China Performance Wonderful United States Transportation Team The Score is 39 to 26

Last night, there was a China-US basketball friendly match in the Zhongqing Fitness Room. Liu's South China team, which was making a comeback, played against the US Air Force Transportation Team. As a result, South China won 39 to 26, with South China leading 20 to 11 in the first half.

South China used Li Xianzheng, He Jingui, and Li Ruixiong as forwards, and the Liu brothers Fushan and Fuqiang as guards, which seemed to be the team's most ideal lineup. The Transportation Team's players were all tall and powerful, but South China's soldiers were active and coordinated well. The Transportation Team's skills had not yet reached their peak. Among them, Ponatti's defender had very good skills, but lacked partners. In the first half, South China led 20 to 11. After the change of sides, the South China Five continued to play, and the Transportation Team changed three people. South China's momentum was still strong, and the players who were transferred to the Transportation Team were not as good as the previous three. In comparison, South China was bound to win. In the last eight minutes, the US military planned to make a desperate move and gradually became rude, which resulted in fouls. South China used a fast attacking method. In the end, South China won 39 to 26.

### The Righteous Overseas Chinese Team is Expected to Play on Saturday

The Righteous Overseas Chinese Football Team has long been praised by Shanghai fans for its skills, but recently, due to the hard life, it needs someone to preside over it. In the first game last week against the British Navy, it gave up because it did not get the hang of it. It is now known that Qu Yaokang, an enthusiastic person in the sports world, has come forward to take charge, and is willing to preside over it, so the team is expected to play against the Korean Overseas Chinese as usual this week. Judging from the team's past record, it will be a strong opponent for our Donghua Qingbai teams.

The contact office is located at 6 Zhongshan East Road (i.e., the Bund).

### Negotiations on Korean Nationals' Evacuation in Progress

[Our Report] Yesterday, the reporter interviewed the person in charge of the Shanghai Office of the Korean Restoration Army regarding the rumor that Korean nationals in China were preparing to return to their country. The answer was as follows: As of now, there are more than 7,000 Korean military and civilians in this city. These include over 5,000 civilians and over 1,000 soldiers. Some evacuated from Yichang, Changsha, Hankou, and other places, and some came from Chongqing and other anti-Japanese war zones. Negotiations regarding the evacuation of Korean nationals are currently being conducted by MacArthur Headquarters and the Chinese government. However, due to a lack of ships, it will inevitably not be done until after one or two months. The disputes over the property and houses of Koreans in this city are also not easy to resolve. China and Korea are brotherly countries. We hope that China will provide assistance on how to make the people of China and Korea live in harmony. Recently, the General Relief Administration transported relief supplies to Shanghai, and this office has also been allocated flour, old clothes, and other items.

### Our Military and Police Authorities Monitor the French Consulate General

[Our Report] Chen Guolian, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, recently told reporters that the local negotiations regarding the "Beradin" ship illegally transporting war criminals out of the country have come to an end. The case has been transferred to Chongqing for handling. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also lodged a strong protest with France and demanded that France fulfill certain conditions. If the French response is not satisfactory to China, China will take appropriate action. The current task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office is to execute the instructions after receiving orders from the ministry. Chen then solemnly stated that the incident itself is a political issue, while such behavior is a legal issue. This is the first major event after China's victory. In order to maintain the independence and integrity of sovereignty, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will not easily let it go. Chen firmly believes that China will be able to achieve a victory of fairness and justice in this negotiation. The reporter then asked Chen how the legal responsibility of the captain of the ship would be handled, given that the Beradin left Shanghai five days ago and may have already arrived in Saigon. Chen replied that China still has the right to make demands.

Also, the reporter heard that senior officials from the Foreign Affairs Section of the Songhu Garrison Command visited Chen yesterday afternoon to discuss matters. According to reliable sources, our military and police authorities have been closely monitoring the French Consulate General, the Consul General's residence, and the French barracks in this city since the afternoon of the 6th to prevent unexpected incidents.

France to Request International Study

[United Press Paris, 7th] A government spokesman announced today: France will submit the issue of extraterritoriality in China to the United Nations General Assembly in London for discussion. Chinese officials protested three days ago that the French Consul in Shanghai had arbitrarily arrested the French National Socialist Karkopino and transferred him to a French warship, claiming that it was an infringement of Chinese sovereignty. The French view is that France still retains extraterritoriality in China until a new treaty is signed between China and France, and officially supports the position of Fei Zongxi, the French Consul General in Shanghai.

Traffic Control and Painting of Markings

Regarding traffic control, in addition to painting "keep to the right" and parking signs at the corners of various intersections, the traffic separation line on Zhongzheng Road is also being painted from east to west. In addition to the reconstruction of 18 tram stops, many other tram stops have been painted white to make them easier for passengers to identify. The bureau has rushed to produce approximately 900 new street nameplates, and the first batch of 300 has been installed, while the remaining 600 are being rushed to install.

Unified Colors for Various Vehicles

In order to improve the appearance of the city, the municipal government has decided to unify the colors of various vehicles in the city. After a meeting of the Public Utilities Bureau, it was decided to divide them into seven categories: buses, private cars, trams, tricycles, rickshaws, and bicycles. Each category will be assigned a separate color. However, given the huge cost of painting, a very wide deadline has been set.

Rickshaws Still Under Consideration

Regarding the abolition of rickshaws, Gu Guoshu, the Public Utilities Bureau, Zhen Bai, told reporters yesterday: Rickshaws are the most common means of transportation in this city. Before other means of transportation replace them, the citizens will feel extremely inconvenienced if they are abolished. So far, the city government has not received any official documents regarding the abolition of rickshaws. He also said that the bureau is currently planning to inspect licensed rickshaws and tricycles one by one. Those that are excessively old, have missing parts, or are dirty will not be allowed to continue operating.

### Six US Generals Awarded Medals Yesterday; Mayor Qian Presided and Presented on Behalf of the Chairman

### Chennault's Statement: China Should Refine Its Air Force; Mission to China to Be Decided After Meeting Chairman

Regarding the rumors that General Chennault came to China to train the air force, he issued a statement saying: Everything has not yet been decided. He came to China in a private capacity, but still retains the rank of Air Force Major General. Chen hinted in his remarks that his work could be officially announced after he meets with Chairman Jiang. However, Chen talked freely about the fact that today, China needs an air force that is refined and can be used in wartime and peacetime, focusing on quality rather than quantity. At the same time, the development of China's aviation industry is also extremely important. More factories should be established to manufacture aircraft so that the development of the aviation industry does not rely on foreign supply. From this point of view, it is generally believed that Chen's visit is inextricably linked to training the air force or helping us develop the aviation industry. Chen said that the members of the Flying Tigers of the past are now working in various jobs in the United States, and they have formed the Flying Tigers Airlines. When Chen first formed the Flying Tigers, there were only 300 members. By the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the staff of the 14th Air Force had increased to 23,000.

Lee Ze's Accusation: Labor and Management Hold Conflicting Views

Mayor Qian States Impartial Handling

Following the Higher Court Prosecutor's Office interrogation and remand, Mayor Qian released a statement yesterday regarding the accusation against Lee Ze. The Xin Xin Company employees and company authorities hold differing opinions. The details are recorded as follows:

Mayor Qian Stresses Importance of Public Security

Mayor Qian addressed the case of the Xin Xin Company employees' accusation against the company's General Manager, Lee Ze. The Police Bureau summoned Lee Ze for investigation, but he repeatedly failed to appear. Therefore, he was arrested at noon on the 7th, on suspicion of being a traitor and has been transferred to judicial authorities for investigation. However, the company's employees posted slogans all over Nanjing Road yesterday morning, causing pedestrians to stop and obstructing traffic. Such behavior is not a legitimate procedure for accusing traitors and is tantamount to an overstepping action that obstructs public security and disrupts social order. This government, in order to maintain public security, has ordered the Social Affairs and Police Bureaus to thoroughly investigate. If there is any malicious false accusation or coercion of the public, it will be suppressed to deter others and maintain public security. People should follow proper procedures to accuse traitors and must not engage in coercion.

Garrison Headquarters Disposes Impartially

After Lee Ze was arrested on suspicion of treason, the Xin Xin Company Board of Directors appointed Xiao Zongjing as acting general manager. Yesterday afternoon, the Garrison Headquarters Investigation Office invited Xiao to the Garrison Headquarters to inquire about the internal situation of the company. Subsequently, Inspector Bi Gaokui went to the Xin Xin Company Employees' Club on Guizhou Road to speak with employee representatives Shu Yueqiao and Yao Zhuoren, instructing them to provide as much evidence as possible of Lee Ze's collaboration with the enemy. The Garrison Headquarters will handle the matter impartially. However, this is Lee Ze's personal problem, and it has come to an end with his arrest. It is hoped that the employees' actions will not affect social order. According to the employees, the statement issued by the Board of Directors yesterday stating "labor-management misunderstanding" does not correspond to the facts, so they have requested the Board of Directors to correct it.

Higher Court Interrogation Leads to Remand

[This Newspaper Report] The case of Lee Ze, General Manager of Xin Xin Company, which has caused a citywide sensation in recent days, was sent to the Higher Court Prosecutor's Office by the Police Bureau on the previous day. At 5:30 PM that afternoon, Judge Cao Jun opened an investigation court to interrogate him, inquiring in detail about his age, origin, address, occupation, etc. Lee admitted that he had served as a director of the puppet Merchants' Association, but denied all other allegations. Due to time constraints, the plaintiff was not summoned to court and was remanded for a later hearing. As this case is the first formal accusation of a traitor by the people, this reporter interviewed representatives of both labor and management of the company yesterday. The details are compiled as follows:

Employees Express No Grudges

The employee representatives, Han Wucheng and others, stated that the case was initially filed by Shu Yueqiao, a former colleague, alone. Because no action was taken for a long time, 800 colleagues collectively reported the matter. Now that Lee Ze has been arrested, the reporting task has come to an end. In the future, a legal advisor will be hired to formally file an appeal. They hope that all sectors will give sympathetic attention and assistance. The employees' actions are purely from the standpoint of the people, not for personal grudges. Therefore, they hope that the government will immediately publicly try Lee Ze and monitor the transfer of his assets. They will refute the statements in the Board of Directors' announcement point by point.

The Company Believes It's About Treatment

A senior official of the company told the reporter that this incident was truly unfortunate for the company. Shu Yueqiao was originally an elevator operator at the New Capital Hotel. Because of his prudence and diligence, he was transferred to the hotel as a waiter. Later, due to a trivial matter, he attacked Lee Ze and was fired from the hotel. Later, he requested reinstatement from the company but was not granted, resulting in this accusation and the street parade. This further aroused the response of all colleagues. The company believes that the main reason why the employees sympathize with Shu Yueqiao is that the company has not given sufficient consideration to their welfare. In addition, the company's colleagues' association originally scheduled to perform a drama on New Year's Day and planned to sell tickets to the outside world to replenish the association's funds. The company believed that this move was tantamount to telling people that the company's treatment was too meager, and considering other industry counterparts, it ordered them to stop the performance. Now that things have come to this point, the right and wrong of Lee Ze should be judged by the national law, which can be set aside for now. As for the internal disputes of the company, it is hoped that they will be resolved peacefully, and the state of opposition will be stopped immediately. The company will not pursue those who initiated this case. The company has already planned to improve the treatment. Currently, the salary of the lowest-level employee is 8,600 yuan per month including meals, which makes it difficult to support a family. In short, it is hoped that private incidents will not be expanded into a confrontation between groups.

Sincere Employees Express Sympathy

[Ta Kung Pao News] The case of the Xin Xin Company employees' accusation against Lee Ze has aroused deep attention from all quarters. Yesterday, all Sincere employees also responded and issued a statement signed by more than 600 people, including Dai Litang from the Southern Goods Department, Cai Minzhong from the Cosmetics and Medicine Department, Sun Weizhen from Sincere Amusement Park, Gao Yuequn from the Piece Goods and Western Clothing Department, Ding Haoran from the Accounting Department, Zhang Xiaohong from the Hardware Department, and Liang Difen from the Leather Goods and Furniture Department. The statement briefly stated that the Xin Xin Company employees' accusation against Lee Ze aroused the sympathy of all our employees. It is hoped that the authorities will take decisive action to deal with it.

Private Shipping Industry Appeals for Compensation for Damages

The Wartime Losses Compensation Committee for Private Shipping Vessels has begun operating at 93 Guangdong Road in the Shipowners' Association, and has submitted requests for record-keeping to relevant agencies. The committee is investigating figures and preparing statistics. It is reported that the association will fill out loss survey forms for each member, prepare statistical tables according to four categories, and prepare a compensation plan. The association will send Standing Committee member Zhong Shandao to Chongqing to appeal to the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Communications, Military Affairs Commission, and Rear Service Headquarters, and other relevant agencies, requesting prompt approval of compensation.

French Concession Water and Electricity Meter Maintenance Fees

Public Utilities Bureau Notifies Cancellation

The French Tramway and Electric Lighting Company has been collecting water and electricity meter maintenance fees from users since September of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, and has not yet cancelled it. Recently, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, in view of the fact that water and electricity prices have been comprehensively adjusted, other incidental expenses should be standardized as much as possible to ensure fairness. The bureau has notified the company to stop collecting the above water and electricity meter maintenance fees from January 1st of this year.

U.S. Dollar Follows Gold Market's Fluctuations

Precious Metal Prices Continue to Rise by 15,000

Stock Market Conditions Generally Stable

Precious metal prices continued to rise yesterday, with a temporary dip in the middle of the day, but ultimately remained firm. Market sentiment was highly uncertain, with major players having differing views on supply and demand. However, actual sales at silver shops were particularly active. General psychology still leaned towards rising prices. The market opened in the morning carrying over the momentum from the previous day, rising to 855,000. Retail investors sold stocks to buy gold, gradually pushing the price up to 867,000. Major players took advantage of the high price to sell, hindering the rise and leading to a consolidation. At noon, many bulls closed their positions, causing the price to fall to 845,000. In the afternoon, stocks and bonds suddenly rose sharply. Retail investors chased purchases at low prices, and silver shops frequently absorbed the supply. Major players pulled up the price from the side. Although transactions were limited, the lack of supply pushed the price up to 875,000, after which it began to hover. As a result, the closing price was 15,000 higher than the previous close. Gold jewelry in silver shops was listed at 93,000, and silver ingots also rose to 700 yuan. Silver dollars hovered around 450 yuan, and unofficial lending rates remained extremely stable, with interest rates fixed at around 10%.

The U.S. dollar continued to follow the gold market's fluctuations, lacking special stimuli. The trend remained unusually firm, with considerable uncertainty in the middle of the day. However, the trading range was narrow. The market opened at 1,460 yuan in the morning, and retreated from 1,470 yuan to 1,445 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, stimulated by the gold price, the market closed at a higher price, rising 20 yuan compared with the previous close. The Hong Kong dollar was stable.

Government bonds were initially flat and then stabilized. In the end, the market closed at a high price due to deliberate manipulation by insiders, but it was too late, and the high closing price was entirely due to the actions of market makers, with no special changes. As a result, mature issues were firm compared to the previous close, while miscellaneous issues failed to keep up. Class A and B bonds were flat, Class C bonds rose 60 yuan, Class D bonds rose 10 yuan, and Class E bonds rose 30 yuan.

There were differing views on supply and demand for Chinese stocks, and major players entered and exited the market in different ways. However, compared to each other, there were more sellers than buyers, so the market was quite hesitant in the middle of the day. However, at noon, surplus capital from profits in foreign stocks came to absorb Xinyi Yarn Factory, affecting other stocks. Securities firms, with this help and feeling that the gold market was lackluster, came to pull up the price again. As a result, the noon close once again reached a high point. The shouting price continued to rise in the afternoon. Compared with the previous close, Yongxin Yarn was up 85 yuan, Meiya was up 15 yuan, and the three small mature issues of Jingfu, etc., had slight ups and downs. This was because major players were focused on Xinyi and Yongxin yarn, and had no time to take care of smaller stocks. Other unpopular issues were less impressive due to lack of time. The shouting price continued to rise in the afternoon.

Foreign stocks were less impressive due to insiders taking profits. However, as surplus capital from profits in Chinese stocks poured into foreign stocks, Yisha turned from fatigue to stability. Other small and unpopular issues failed to follow the recovery. As a result, Yisha rose 10 yuan compared to the previous close, Yihua Brewery fell 50 yuan, Paper Industry fell 40 yuan, and other stocks recovered by about half.

Yarn Prices Begin to Fall

China Textile Construction Company Sells Yarn and Cloth

Yesterday, the yarn market was volatile. The market opened at the highest price in the morning, then gradually declined and closed at a low price. Buyers were waiting and watching, and the trading volume was not large. The demand for fine yarn was particularly scarce. Each count of yarn fell by about 10% compared to the previous day.

Rumors circulated in the market that the authorities would sell a large amount of yarn produced by the enemy-owned yarn factories that had been taken over, and that the price of Hong Kong yarn was falling, so buyers were hesitant and prices fell.

In addition, the China Textile Construction Company began selling yarn and cloth on the 7th to regulate civilian needs and suppress market prices. It offered 300 bales of yarn, with the price of 42-count blue phoenix double-strand yarn at 1.38 million per bale, 32-count yarn at 1.1 million, and 20-count yarn at 750,000. The spot yarn market initially carried over the high opening price from the previous day, and the transaction was flat. Later, when it was learned that the China Textile Construction Company had opened for sale, market sentiment weakened, and market prices fell. 42-count yarn fell by a small 100,000, and 20-count yarn fell by a small 60,000. Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company continued to offer more than 10,000 pieces of cotton cloth and about 200 bales of cotton yarn, with prices similar to the previous day. However, the company only sold to printing and dyeing factories and the yarn and cloth industry. The cotton cloth was sold by printing and dyeing factories such as Xinfu, Changxing, and Risheng, as well as cloth shops such as Zhaotai. The cotton yarn was sold separately by yarn shops such as Chengyu, Changzhen, Dachang, and Yifeng.

Silk and Satin Continue to be Firm

Yesterday, the silk market was volatile. The opening price of rayon was 940,000 yuan for the 120th Sky Bridge. Then it returned to 915,000 yuan. Later, there was news that the Tongfa warehouse receipt could be shipped within one or two days. For a time, market sentiment weakened and the market fell sharply. The closing price was 890,000 yuan. The warehouse receipt was 700,000 yuan, which was 450,000 yuan higher than the spot price on the previous day. Because export merchants had no formal transactions, and manufacturers and users believed that the finished products did not match the raw materials, there was a lot of wait-and-see attitude. Transactions were scarce and the price was similar to the previous day. As raw materials rose sharply, the price of silk goods rose. Meiya quilt covers were traded at 610,000 per 100 pieces. Later, as the silk market declined, it fell back slightly by 10,000 yuan. The price of Minsheng brocade was slightly higher than the previous day, at 9,000 yuan per piece.

Grain Prices are Firm

Oil, Bean Flour, and Bean Cake All Rise

The digestion of rice and grain on this street remains flat. Early in the morning, it was said that the Qingdao route of the northern merchants was moving but not prosperous. The customers were firm in their prices due to the high prices in various producing areas, and the market price rose slightly by more than 100 yuan. The white yuan market was fixed. The oil market continued to rise by more than 2,000 yuan due to the heavy demand from Ningbo merchants. The price of yellow soybeans from Fujian and Taiwan was high and getting higher, increasing by 200 to 300 yuan. The flour from Fujian merchants and the Zhoushan Islands continued to be loaded, and the price rose by more than 200 yuan again. The price of raw peanuts from foreign firms was very high, and sesame seeds were firm. Soybean cake continued to be shipped from Southeast Asia, and the market looked up by 100 yuan. The government's low-priced oil has been shipped, and sales will begin tomorrow. The retail price has not changed.

Metal Nails Sell Well

Metal nails have always been a popular item in the large hardware market. Recently, this has become even more pronounced. Because merchants from all over the country are purchasing hardware, they are all targeting this item, so prices are rising day by day. Currently, 1-inch nails are sold for 34,000 yuan, 1.5-inch nails are sold for 28,000 yuan, and 2-inch to 3-inch nails are sold for around 22,000 yuan.

British Reduce White Paper Prices

[Reuters, London, 8th] The British Ministry of Supply has issued an order to reduce the maximum price of white paper by 55 shillings per ton.

Tianjin Merchants Absorb Green Tea

The bulk of black tea is traditionally sold to Guangdong merchants, but since the route has become difficult, trading has been stagnant for a long time. Now that the rivers and mountains have been restored, there is a sign of recovery. As for green tea such as fried green and baked green, merchants in Tianjin are also in great demand. Therefore, they have started to absorb large quantities in recent days. The market entered a total of 270 to 280 dan yesterday. In terms of price, each dan has been increased by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, stores on this street are still frequently replenishing their stocks, and more than 100 dan have already been prepared, and the trend is following suit.

Commercial News Briefs

Recently, Carnation milk powder is not as abundant in the market as before. This is because domestic milk powder factories and fresh milk companies have been severely affected, so they have purchased a large amount. In addition, many merchants are transporting it to the interior.

The supply of white plain fine cloth for gambling is not smooth. Although products from Changzhou and Wuxi are transported to Shanghai for regulation, the quality is inferior and does not meet the dyeing needs of dyeing and weaving factories in this city. Therefore, once merchants purchase it, it becomes scarce.

Although there are many arrivals of sugar, merchants are bullish on the market and hold on to their goods. Sales are very strong due to the relationship with the New Year's season. There is a shortage of high-end rock sugar on the market, and prices are gradually rising.

There are still many actual sales of Western medicines, and with the frequent rise in gold prices, the market is strong and unstoppable.

Among canned foods, canned anchovies are the most popular. Merchants in Chongqing have a strong demand for it. Other canned foods are still flat.

The price of wool yarn is rising due to merchant purchases. Crane brand is 12,000 yuan, and miscellaneous brand wool yarn is 9,000 to 10,000 yuan.

Although yarn prices fell slightly yesterday compared to the previous day, the prices of many knitted products are still rising due to the continued rise in gold prices.

Cosmetics have been rising in recent days due to merchant activity, especially soaps. Zong sandalwood soap has jumped to 50,000 yuan.

Yarn and Cloth Factories Eagerly Await the Return of Confiscated Yarn and Cloth

The Yarn Industry Association, Cotton Cloth Industry Association, and Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association of this city recently submitted a joint request to the Executive Yuan, the Commissioner of Comfort, the Inspector, and the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration for the return of the remaining amount of yarn and cloth forcibly purchased by the enemy and puppets, which was transferred by the puppet Merchants' Association to the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration. Thousands of yarn and cloth factories in the city are closely watching the development of this event. It has been learned that the legal grounds held by the association are as follows: (1) According to the provisions of Articles 92 and 290 of the Civil Code, the purchase of yarn and cloth is an act of coercion and should be invalid. That is, in accordance with the principle of handling the additional second item, the enemy and puppets forcibly bought factories. Victims may apply for recovery, and the enemy and puppets forcibly bought yarn and cloth. According to the Cairo Declaration, the right to declare invalid the transfer or transaction of property or rights in enemy-occupied areas is reserved. (2) The people originally had no obligation to abide by the laws of the enemy and puppets. The purchase of yarn and cloth by the enemy and puppets was an illegal plunder, which clearly infringes upon the basic rights and interests of the people. Articles 16 and 17 of the Provisional Law of the Training Period of the Republic of China clearly stipulate the property rights of the people. (3) Articles 767 and 949 of the Civil Law of China also have clear provisions for the protection of property rights. (4) In international law, there are two types of enemy property: state-owned and privately owned. If it belongs to the state and is movable property that can be used for war, confiscation is the principle. If it is not used for war, it cannot be confiscated. If it is private, both movable and immovable property should be respected. According to Article 53, Paragraph 2 of the Hague Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, weapons that belong to purely private individuals may be seized when necessary, and must be returned when peace is restored and their losses compensated. (5) In terms of international law, the law of the place where the property is located is the principle. The remaining yarn and cloth is still in the country. According to Chinese law, the defendant may assert his rights.

According to Mr. Pan Shihao, the person in charge of the association, the dispute over enemy property is a serious problem at present, and in fact it does not belong to the property of the enemy and puppets. In recent times, people have been arguing that the government will have fair and reasonable measures. The dyeing, weaving, and yarn industries have suffered the most widespread and deepest damage. The total price was 3,624,154,452 yuan and 58 cents.

The Girl with the Last Perm in Spring and Autumn by L莽莽

I came to this city of perms, and everywhere I encountered girls with permed hair; those thin faces became thinner; those fat faces became fatter; those young ones looked older, and those middle-aged ones looked even more weary. Yellow skin surrounded by curly hair is no more beautiful than white skin; yet all I encountered were girls with permed hair!

In a secluded place, there was a girl in plain clothes who alone maintained a natural demeanor. Black hair hung straight down by her ears, by her neck; neat, beautiful, maintaining an oriental charm.

I was lost in thought, I stared at her. Indeed, her pure black hair and dark eyes complemented each other! So I was gratified, I was pleased that there were still girls in this city who did not perm their hair.

I walked past her door several times, I admired her uncurled straight hair several times. Now she began to look at my gaze with suspicion. Now, she knew I was looking at her hair; now, she answered my gaze with an apologetic look. But I didn't know what she was apologizing for?

I walked past her door again from the opposite direction. An unfamiliar girl with puffy hair was standing solemnly facing the direction I had come from. As I walked past this permed girl, I seemed to hear a sound like a nightingale. I turned back, and heavens, it was that girl who didn't perm her hair.

Now she had actually permed her hair! I was stunned; she smiled, a smile with flattery. I was truly stunned.

This girl with the last perm did not understand the true meaning of my shock, thinking I was stunned by her permed hair.

I was indeed stunned by her permed hair, but the "stunned" I felt was not the "stunned" she understood!

This girl with the last perm, this is our last meeting.

Rain Flower by Shi Jimi

That seven-colored rainbow is said to be a bridge from earth to heaven; but this bridge is not easily seen, it must appear after a great storm, and only for a moment.

The reason why roses are beautiful is because they have thorns; otherwise, wouldn't the movingly beautiful red monthly rose also be praised?

Peacocks have beautiful feathers to show off, and when they spread their tails, they almost dominate the universe, but other than that, they are useless. As for camels, these ugly animals sacrifice their lives to give travelers some favors in arid deserts without water, because within that unsightly form lies a useful water reservoir.

So we think of the omnipotence and greatness of the Creator, and how impartial and selfless He is to all things.

"When the cold winter is far away and spring comes, what will make you happiest?" She asked.

"Too much," I thought for a moment, "In the water country, there is the smile of spring brought by the south wind, and there are the melodious warblings of nightingales, the clear songs of swallows, bright flowers and dark willows, blue skies and fragrant meadows..."

She nodded, but then shook her head again, smiling: "You're right; but why did you forget to say: that clap of spring thunder that awakens and revitalizes all dormant things?"

Year after year, from spring to summer to autumn to winter, and then to the spring of the coming year; I watched peach blossoms bloom and wither, apricot blossoms bloom and wither, chrysanthemums bloom and wither, plum blossoms bloom and wither... A series of blossoms and withers never caused me even the slightest sorrow, never moved me in any way.

Do you say I am too heartless? No! They will all bloom again in the garden next year. The youth of flowers and plants is too short, but it is not like people, whose youth is only once; their youth is long-lasting.

Life and Truth by Hong Ye

"When life flows like a gentle song, it's easy for people to find laughter, but what about those who are truly worthy? It is those who smile in the face of adversity."

Thinking of these words makes me think of many friends who, like me, are young and living in hardship, but they have no resentment.

They understand this truth, just like me.

The truths in the world are limited. Isn't it most great and unique to be able to grasp one link in the sublimation of these limited truths?

However, when the surging torrent of reality rages across the plains of life, will this superman sink to the bottom of the eternal abyss along with the surging waves?

This is always a mystery to me.

(Two)

"Those who can fight against darkness are not the most valuable, the truly most valuable are those who can find the source of darkness in the darkness."

I am not surprised by this extraordinary uniqueness, but only by the terribleness of this uniqueness.

Darkness is the endless storehouse of world civilization. Even if you fight against it and destroy part of its endless storehouse, other parts will follow. What's the use? So people have to hold up the torch of truth to find the darkness. This seems very thorough, but when countless evil, hypocritical, and boring storms blow from all directions, won't this small spark surrounded by the fog of darkness be quickly extinguished? Unless you relight it with the match of courage.

However, is this match of courage easy to obtain?

(Three)

"When you feel pain in your heart, immerse yourself in yourself."

Yes, the taste of pain is very difficult to endure, I know it very clearly; because I am always wandering in pain. I think: Now should be the time to get drunk, right?

So, I held up a glass of wine and poured it down my throat, without any consideration; two glasses, three glasses... until ten glasses of wine, I was deeply drunk, this is so happy, but unfortunately, too many tears seeped into the laughter of the drunk.

The falseness between people is forever. Except for dreams and drunkenness, the sincere, beautiful, and primitive nature that people yearn for can never be realized.

However,
