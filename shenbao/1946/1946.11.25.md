Speculation from Various Parties Suggests It Is Related to Mediation Work

(Special Dispatch from Beiping, This Newspaper, 24th) Marshall will arrive in Beiping from Tianjin on the afternoon of the 25th, and the local authorities have prepared welcome arrangements. Marshall's arrival in the north does not seem to be for private matters or travel. Some official sources hinted to reporters that Marshall is still coming for "mediation." Some people speculate that Marshall will meet with Ye Jianying to persuade him to stop the withdrawal of the group personnel and retain the structure of the Military Mediation Department, so that when the opportunity for peace comes again, he can immediately carry out peace work. In addition, Marshall may also express his views on the increasingly expanding war in North and Northeast China through Ye Jianying.

Marshall did not hold any formal meetings or talks in Tianjin and is scheduled to go to Beiping on the 25th to return to Nanjing with his wife.

### Willing to Maintain a Super-Partisan Position, Continue to Strive for Mediation, Democratic League Issues Written Statement

(Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 24th) The China Democratic League held a press conference at 2:30 PM on the 24th and issued the following written statement:

The purpose of the China Democratic League is to realize democracy in China. However, unity, unification, and peace are the prerequisites for the realization of democracy in the country. Therefore, since its establishment, the Democratic League has decided to stand in a third-party position and strive to mediate the military conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. A divided country, a country that continues to engage in civil war, cannot have democracy. This is our view in the past, and it is still our view today.

The Political Consultative Conference held in January of this year did indeed open up a clear and bright path for solving the country's problems. If the responsible ruling parties could have implemented the five resolutions based on the procedures determined by the Political Consultative Conference as soon as possible, we firmly believe that the situation in China would have improved earlier. Unfortunately, many opportunities for unity, unification, and peace have been missed in the past ten months.

From February of this year until today, the Democratic League has consistently adhered to two principles:

First, the Democratic League supports the Political Consultative Conference. Because the Democratic League is a participant in the Political Consultative Conference, we have an obligation to abide by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and at the same time, we have a responsibility to urge all parties to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. The resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference are a kind of contract between the participating parties, which can also be said to be a kind of Magna Carta for China's pursuit of peace and democracy. The National Assembly must be formulated in accordance with the draft agreement. This explains the importance and dignity of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. If any party participating in this contract can arbitrarily tear it up, then there can be no rule of law in China in the future, and even less constitutionalism and democracy.

Second, the Democratic League opposes civil war. The Democratic League is a political party without military force. The Democratic League firmly believes that whether the ruling or opposition parties possess military force, the country will not have peace, and it will never be able to embark on the right path of democracy. Moreover, all the people of China today unanimously oppose civil war. Therefore, for the past ten months, the Democratic League has always been a super-partisan and independent third party, striving to mediate the military conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. These two things are interrelated, because there must be peace in order to implement the five resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and the faithful implementation of the five resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference is necessary to guarantee China's permanent peace. This explains the path and painstaking efforts of all the work of the Democratic League in the past ten months.

On October 21, the representatives of the Democratic League at the Political Consultative Conference accepted the invitation of the government representatives and came to Nanjing together with representatives of other parties at the Political Consultative Conference and social figures. All our efforts have never departed from the above two principles. On the one hand, we strive to implement the five resolutions in accordance with the procedures of the Political Consultative Conference, and on the other hand, we call for peace and seek to stop the party struggle with military force. Until the night of November 14, on the eve of the opening of the National Assembly, the so-called third party exhausted its efforts but still failed to save the time. At the same time, other parties and social figures could finally decide their own actions from their own positions. Only then did our Democratic League representatives reluctantly temporarily stop our mediation work. Our wisdom was insufficient, and we stopped when our strength was exhausted. This is a point that we hope the people of the country will understand.

The Democratic League refused to participate in the National Assembly held on November 15 for a very simple reason: the convening of the National Assembly this time violated the entire spirit of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, broke the procedures of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, and this National Assembly is not a constitutional conference for national unity and unification. This is a fact that is universally recognized. The Democratic League has repeatedly declared its support for the Political Consultative Conference, and has repeatedly declared that it will absolutely not participate in any actions that can strengthen division. The Democratic League should adhere to its promise today to gain the trust of the people of the country. The foundation of democratic constitutionalism is that all people in the country jointly legislate, and all people in the country abide by the law unanimously. There must first be the substance of joint legislation before the effect of unanimous law-abiding can be achieved. The formulation of the Constitution is a major undertaking of the country. The content of the Constitution is certainly important, but the legal basis for the institutions that produce the Constitution is even more important. The legal and illegal issues of the source of the basic law often cause long-term disputes and divisions in the country. There are many precedents in world history, and there are also many practical examples in the history of the Republic of China. We know that even if the Democratic League participates in the current National Assembly, it will not only fall into the error of destroying the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference itself, but it will not help the future constitutionalism, nor will it help the current national unity, unification, and peace. Therefore, we only have the path of remaining super-partisan to seek the peace of mind of our conscience.

This attitude of the Democratic League is by no means passive. In today's reality of Chinese politics, it is necessary to first seek the cessation of the military conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and then there will be peace. Only with peace can there be constitutionalism and democracy. From the standpoint of the common people, the people must first have the opportunity to survive before they can talk about the Constitution. It is necessary to first stop this cruel and inhumane civil war before the people can have the opportunity to survive. There are countless problems to be solved in China today, but the most urgent and important problem is to stop the military war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Our Democratic League clearly recognizes this major key, so we are willing to maintain the position of a super-partisan and independent third party in the civil war environment, and continue to strive for the greatest effort in mediating the military party struggle, in order to strive for the true peace of the country, promote the true unity of the country, establish the true constitutionalism of China, and realize the true democracy of China. November 24, 1946

### At the Democratic League's Reception for Journalists, a Wave of Sharp Inquiries, Answered Separately by Luo Longji and Others

(Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 24th) The Democratic League held a press conference at 3:30 PM on the 24th to report on the Democratic League's attitude towards the state of affairs. More than 100 journalists from various places in Nanjing attended. Luo Longji, Minister of Propaganda of the Democratic League, presided over the meeting. First, he read out a written statement, and then the journalists raised questions, which were answered separately by Luo Longji, Zhang Shenfu, and Zhang Bojun. The important points are recorded as follows:

Question: What specific methods will the Democratic League use in the future to mediate the Kuomintang-Communist Party issue?

Answer: The Democratic League is still working hard to restore peace talks and stop the civil war. As for the method, it cannot be revealed.

Question: What is the Democratic League's attitude towards the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the National Assembly?

Answer: The Democratic League has a regulation for adjusting party relations, the main point of which is that each unit that constitutes the Democratic League shall not independently and directly negotiate with the government. The Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the National Assembly violates the regulations, so the Democratic League will deal with it accordingly.

Question: What is the Democratic League's view on the draft constitution?

Answer: We have two views: (1) We cannot recognize a constitution that is not completed by the Political Consultative Conference. This is discussed and studied by a minority of people. At the same time, the most important point, that the Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan, is not a clause of the Political Consultative Conference resolution, but was proposed by the government at that time. There are also some other parts for which the Democratic League reserves criticism.

Question: On November 11, the Democratic League, social figures, and the Youth Party held a meeting at Jiaotong Bank and decided to write to Chairman Chiang to request that the National Assembly be postponed to December 1, and declared that all those who signed would participate in the National Assembly. After Zhang Shenfu, Zhang Bojun, and others met with the Communist Party representatives, they temporarily removed the names they had signed. Is this true? And does it conflict with the Democratic League's super-partisan position?

Answer: This letter was proposed in the name of a group, signed by individuals, and declared that they would not participate in a non-unified National Assembly. This letter is now with Mo Dehui. Since it was signed in an individual capacity, individuals who are unwilling can of course withdraw. At that time, Zhang Shenfu immediately stood up and said: If the Kuomintang-Communist Party issue is not resolved, then all issues cannot be resolved. Each time the third party proposes a plan, it considers whether it can be approved by both parties. If it cannot be approved, it will only increase the difficulty of mediation and hurt the feelings of both parties. At that time, we discovered that the matter of writing to postpone the National Assembly was not appropriate, so we had to temporarily withdraw.

Question: What is the Democratic League's opinion on Zhang Junmai's exchange of letters with Chairman Chiang and Zhang Junmai's personal non-participation in the National Assembly?

Answer: This is an internal affair of the Democratic Socialist Party, and we do not want to make any criticism.

Question: The Democratic League claims that the convening of the National Assembly has no legal basis. What legal basis does the Political Consultative Conference resolution have?

Answer: The Political Consultative Conference resolution not only has a legal basis but is also a draft of a Magna Carta. Since the Political Consultative Conference resolution has been overturned, the National Assembly has no basis.

Question: In addition to the representatives of the Kuomintang, the Democratic Socialist Party, the Youth Party, and social figures, there are also people's representatives participating in this National Assembly. The so-called Constitution should be based on the public opinion of the masses. Please, when it comes to representing public opinion, should we value the National Assembly or the Democratic League's opinion?

Answer: There is no basis for saying which party represents more public opinion, and any country's constitution-making must take into account all aspects. If some people do not participate in the constitution-making, they can not recognize it.

Question: Since the Democratic League believes that the National Assembly is illegal, what does it indicate?

Answer: The Democratic League will not be bound by this kind of constitution.

Question: If there are hooligans, bandits, and a minority of people who have not participated in the constitution-making, are they not also bound by this constitution, and does the national law even exist? (At that time, there was an uproar in the audience, and Luo immediately gave a side answer)

Answer: When we were at the Political Consultative Conference, we were equal in status with the various parties. Hooligans and bandits are illegal people, so they cannot be compared.

Question: The Democratic Socialist Party has a total of 40 people participating in the National Assembly, which is one-third of the number of representatives of the Democratic League. However, it is heard that only 20 people from the Democratic Socialist Party participated in the Democratic League. How is this allocated?

Answer: This is given by the government. The press conference ended at about 4:00 PM. From beginning to end, the questioners were extremely enthusiastic and fierce. Luo also felt very inadequate when answering questions, and Zhang Shenfu and Zhang Bojun sometimes assisted him before he could finish the meeting.

### Draft Constitution to Be Submitted to National Assembly, Wang Chonghui Sorts Out Report Overnight, Wu Jingxiong Talks About Opinions on Revised Draft

(Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 24th) The amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China, after the Legislative Yuan has completed the legislative process and submitted it to the National Government, can be submitted to the National Assembly as the basis for constitution-making. Wang Chonghui, the original sorter of the case, has been drafting a report on the sorting process of the Constitution with Pu Xuefeng and Yang Zhonghu, advisors to the Supreme National Defense Council, in preparation for submitting it to the National Assembly. Wang and the other two worked all day yesterday, extending to 1:00 AM, and it is heard that all the work will be completed soon.

(Central News Agency Dispatch from this City) Dr. Wu Jingxiong, an authority on the Constitution, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the night before last, stayed for a day, and returned to Nanjing by car last night. When the reporter visited Mr. Wu before his departure, he asked for his opinion on the revised draft of the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft Amendment. He said: The revised draft of the Constitution is no longer a Kuomintang constitution in terms of its content. Although its general structure has not deviated from the basic theory of the Five-Power Constitution, it has integrated many opinions from various parties, so it is actually a compromise constitution. The constitution takes the theory of the five-power constitution as the body, and the opinions of all parties on the constitution as the use. Looking at the entire constitution, it fully contains the spirit of democracy and the purpose of compromise. In short, the final constitution review committee had very harmonious opinions, and the objective needs were the basis, and its spirit actually surpassed that of party factions. Personally, I am very satisfied with all the chapters of the final revised draft, except that the powers of the National Assembly seem too narrow and should be expanded. I believe it is a constitution that can be implemented and is full of the spirit of democracy.

### Organic Law of the Control Yuan

Forty to fifty clerks, commissioned, but twelve of them may be recommended. Twenty to forty clerks, twenty to forty office workers, all commissioned. The Control Yuan may employ four to six compilers and use forty to sixty employees as appropriate.

### Qingdao's Reception Situation

### National Assembly Anecdotes

— Our reporter, Pu Dejie

— A Glimpse of the Day Before the First Plenary Session

Without meetings for two consecutive days, the National Assembly Hall appears quite deserted. A large number of taxis are lined up on the side of the road opposite the main gate. It is rare to see one moving, and even when they do, there are very few passengers inside. Moreover, they are all staff members. The representatives either have social engagements or have nothing to do. Some representatives are strolling the streets of Taiping Road, buying small items.

There is less automobile traffic in the Assembly Hall area, fewer people coming and going, and fewer police officers. Each one stands leisurely in the sun, occasionally waving a finger to direct one or two cars in and out, occasionally greeting one or two reporters who are trying to sneak into the venue to chase news, looking around, and saying "Sorry," completely without the tense appearance during the meetings. But what tomorrow will be like, no one can say.

Every seat in the venue is empty, every loudspeaker is covered with a purple-red cloth hat, the electric lights around the hall are on, but the fluorescent lights on the ceiling are not. Quietly, craftsmen are tidying up the total door curtains of the presidium offices and the National Government Chairman's rest room on both sides of the stage. Starting tomorrow, the two door curtains will be extremely busy.

The 24th is one of the National Assembly's only idle days. The staff of each department has the opportunity to rest. The ladies in the cloakroom are nowhere to be found. The ladies in the deliberation group are taking photos inside and outside the hall. The telephone operator is also sitting there chatting in Sichuan dialect. The Secretariat of the National Assembly will be established on the 25th. The Secretariat of the Preparatory Committee said that the handover would be handled on the 24th, but Secretary-General Hong is still Secretary-General Hong. There is really no handover to be done. It will be a matter of official seals starting on the 25th.

Someone said, "You news reporters are the most snobbish. Now that Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart are not leaving Nanjing, I'm afraid you won't look for them. Look, no one goes to the CCP office in Meiyuan, and no one goes to the Youth Party office in Fengyi Village. Today, they found the Democratic League again." Indeed, the only news event on the 24th was the Democratic League's reception for reporters, which was a major event. In Room No. 1 upstairs at the Longmen Restaurant, smoke was swirling, and heads were crowded together. The reporters were all inside and out, questions chasing one after another, one tighter than the other. Even a good orator like Luo Longji seemed unable to handle it.

The news reporters have nothing to do. In the afternoon, they listen to the Democratic League's declaration, watch the Social Democratic Party report, put together the names and faces of the Social Democratic representatives, and then run to Liuhuachun together. The Nanjing City Journalists Association hosts a banquet to entertain colleagues from various places who are attending the National Assembly to cover the event.

The National Assembly will officially begin on the 25th. The "National Assembly Daily," hosted by Hu Chunbing, will also be published on that day. The format is a four-page sheet, divided into four pages. In addition to the Assembly Communiqué news, the content will mainly consist of various reference materials. In addition, staff of the Secretariat have been working night shifts since the 23rd, taking turns to stay in the office from 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM.

The Journalists Association's evening banquet was held in the hall of Liuhuachun. A large piece of red satin was covered with signatures. A large cafeteria was filled with guests, talking and laughing, applause rising and falling, followed by "Five Kings" and "Eight Immortals," with thumb-wrestling everywhere. Those who could drink were holding a wine pot in one hand and a wine glass in the other, going on expeditions to the east and west. The ladies could not help but drink, their faces red. The foreign friends also said "Four Seasons Wealth" and "Full Fortune and Longevity." By the time the banquet ended, everyone was still in high spirits, as if they had drunk someone's wedding wine. The boss of Liuhuachun said, "There are really a lot of people today. This kind of excitement is the first time I've seen it since the victory." (End)

### Ten Legislators Discuss the Draft Amendment to the Constitution (3)

— Our reporter, Yu Zhenji

Presidential System? New Presidential System?

The article that received the most attention from the legislators during this review of the draft constitution was Article 56 (Article 58 of the Draft Amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China), which was drafted according to the principles of the Political Consultative Conference. It raises the question of the Executive Yuan being responsible to the Legislative Yuan. According to the provisions of this article, "If the Legislative Yuan does not approve of the important policies of the Executive Yuan, it may resolve to request the Executive Yuan to change it. The Executive Yuan may, with the approval of the President, request the Legislative Yuan to reconsider the resolution. If two-thirds of the attending legislators uphold the original resolution during the reconsideration, the Premier of the Executive Yuan shall accept the resolution or resign." The draft constitution also has similar provisions for laws passed by the Legislative Yuan. Such clauses did not exist in the original draft constitution. When Mr. Wang Chonghui explained the matter at the Legislative Yuan's review committee, he stated: The Second Plenary Session of the KMT raised serious doubts about this point. There has also been much discussion from outside. In fact, this provision does not necessarily have to be described wholesale as a presidential system or a cabinet system. There is no power of no-confidence, and the Executive Yuan has no power to dissolve the Legislative Yuan. Therefore, it differs from the cabinet systems in England and France. At the same time, there is also the provision that "the Premier of the Executive Yuan shall accept the resolution or resign." This is not the case in Greece, which adopts a presidential system, and it is also an improvement over the presidential system. After the Premier of the Executive Yuan resigns, the President can select a new Premier of the Executive Yuan to consult with the court. In this way, there can be more room for maneuver, and the President does not have to directly clash with the Legislative Yuan. In the United States, conflicts between the President and Congress often lead to delays in government affairs, but the new draft constitution has "a provision that two-thirds of the legislators uphold the original resolution," which allows for room for consultation. Mr. Wang described this system as a new presidential system.

Wu Jingxiong, the original drafter of the May 5th Constitution, believes that this system is still a presidential system, but at the same time, it has the meaning of a cabinet system. This is because the cabinet system has two characteristics: (1) Cabinet members are produced from among the parliamentarians, and (2) the parliament has the power of no-confidence in the cabinet. The new draft constitution is different from this. The Premier of the Executive Yuan is nominated by the President, and the Legislative Yuan only has the power to agree, which is the same as the presidential system in the United States. If the Executive Yuan expresses dissatisfaction with the constitution formulated by the Legislative Yuan, it can be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration with the approval of the President. If two-thirds of the legislators do not uphold the original resolution, it must be revised, which is also proof of the emphasis on the presidential system.

Most legislators expressed satisfaction with this provision. Li Qing said that the mutual restraint of the executive and legislative branches is a progress in the new constitution, because there is neither the autocracy of the president nor the autocracy of the party. If the parliament is dissolved from time to time, the election will be a waste of time. Even in a small island like England, it takes three months to hold a general election. Given the size of China, it is feared that it will take more than three years to hold an election, which is not realistically permissible.

Zhong Tianxin agreed with Wang Chonghui's explanation, believing that the new draft constitution is a new presidential system. This is because Article 56 stipulates that the Executive Yuan is only responsible to the Legislative Yuan in three situations (first, second, and third paragraphs). Therefore, it is only a limited responsibility, not everything like in a cabinet system. He also pointed out that the original draft constitution also had various restrictions on the Executive Yuan. The only difference is that one has a time limit, and the other has no time limit. Zhong believes that the legislation in the new draft constitution has considerable control over executive policy. In view of the fact that the Legislative Yuan could not implement checks and balances on the Executive Yuan in the past, the new regulations are indeed necessary. As for the Premier of the Executive Yuan resigning if he does not accept the resolution of the Legislative Yuan, the original draft constitution also had this intention.

Zhong also believes that, according to the national conditions, our country is not suitable for implementing a cabinet system. The implementation of this system requires a prerequisite, namely "citizen-oriented," which we do not have. The cabinet system was successfully implemented in the United Kingdom, but it failed in France. The reason lies in this. Furthermore, China is a democratic republic, and the new President will be elected by popular vote. At the same time, adopting a cabinet system is contrary to human nature.

Another supporter is Mr. Chen Xiaocen. Chen believes that the provisions of the new draft constitution are a way to transition from autocracy to democracy. If the public opinion organ has no power over the Executive Yuan, then what is the value of having power? However, the frequent overthrow of cabinets in France is also a warning to us. China's current situation requires stability. If the government has the mentality of living one day at a time, how can the country be established? The new draft constitution has flexible regulations, which are more progressive. Zhang Zhaoyuan also believes that the new system is progressive, but believes that it is not necessary to call it a cabinet system or a presidential system. Those who oppose this system include Chen Guyuan and Chen Changheng. Chen Guyuan believes that the executive being responsible to the legislature will confuse political power and governing power. Chen Changheng believes that every discussion of the law may lead to disputes, and it may be difficult to implement Article 56. At least "resignation" does not need to be stipulated in the constitution. As for responsibility, the Executive Yuan is directly responsible to the President and indirectly responsible to the Legislative Yuan. It does not seem appropriate to be responsible to the legislature. He believes that paragraphs two and three can be retained, but words such as "the Premier of the Executive Yuan resigns" should be deleted.

Power of Consent and the Five-Power Theory

On the theory of "checks and balances," another issue that caused a great uproar was the issue of the power of consent. Generally, it is believed that having the power of consent means destroying the five-power system. In addition to the "disapproval" resolution that the Legislative Yuan can make on the important policies of the Executive Yuan mentioned above, the constitution also involves the power of consent in Article 55 (Article 56 of the Draft Amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China) "The Premier of the Executive Yuan is nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Legislative Yuan"; Article 82 (Article 83 of the same) "The Judicial Yuan shall have one President and several Grand Justices, who shall be nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Control Yuan"; Article 88 (Article 89 of the same) "The Examination Yuan shall have several members of the Examination Committee, who shall be nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Control Yuan"; Article 94 (Article 95 of the same) "The Control Yuan is the highest control organ of the country, exercising the power of consent, impeachment, and supervision." All of these are stipulated according to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference.

Zhong Tianxin's explanation of the power of consent is the most exquisite. Zhong believes that after the Legislative Yuan and others have the power of consent, it cannot be considered that the executive power will be restricted, thus losing its independence, and further believes that the new system is a cabinet system that destroys the five-power system. Zhong especially pointed out that there is also the power of consent under the presidential system. For example, the appointment of the Secretary of State, Secretary of the Army, and Secretary of the Navy by the President of the United States must be approved by Congress. This is the example. The scope of power in our country cannot be compared with that of the United States. Zhong believes that it is necessary to adopt the power of consent system according to our country's national conditions. The concept of appointing private individuals in our country is very deep. If party politics are developed, the trend of appointing people from the same party will be prevalent, which can be restricted after this.

Chen Changheng made a further view, believing that important appointments, at least the President and Vice President, should not be appointed by the Legislative or Control Yuan, but should be submitted to the National Assembly for approval.

Central and Local, Province and County

The Political Consultative Conference made four provisions for the relationship between the central and local governments: (1) Determining the province as the highest unit of local autonomy; (2) The division of powers between the province and the central government shall be stipulated in accordance with the principle of equitable distribution of powers; (3) Provincial governors shall be elected by the people; (4) Provinces may formulate provincial constitutions (later changed to autonomous laws), but they must not conflict with the national constitution. The new draft constitution has adopted the above resolutions.

Legislator Di Ying also strongly opposed this point when speaking in the Legislative Yuan before, believing that this fact violated the Premier's will. "The county is the unit of autonomy" is the Premier's most important proposition for saving China. Now, canceling this article will increase the trend of separatism. Chen Guyuan believes that it is good to list the powers of the central and local governments separately, but after the province becomes an autonomous unit, it will easily become a separatist situation. Chen Xiaocen adopted a compromise view, believing that in our country's history, a large local power will lead to division, and a small local power will be undemocratic. The new draft constitution stipulates very well and can be tried out. However, it is believed that it is more in line with the national conditions for the county to be the unit of self-governance. Some people suggest reducing the provincial area, which may also be a way. Chen Changheng believes that the province can formulate autonomous laws, but in addition to not conflicting with the constitution, the phrase "not conflicting with central laws" should be added.

Zhang Yuan believes that it is a progress to change the province, which used to be a "transition from the top to the bottom," into an autonomous unit. Since the province is an autonomous unit, it should have autonomous laws to adapt to local conditions according to the different political conditions of each province, without violating the central laws. Li Qing also made the same view, believing that the conditions of each province are different. National policies should be determined by the central government, and matters that are suitable for local conditions should be delegated to the local government as much as possible. The original draft constitution was too lax on this point, and the new draft constitution is more progressive. Regarding the point of "provincial governors being elected by the people," the original constitution stipulated that they should be appointed by the central government. This was to adapt to the situation and cannot be permanent.

Finally, there is one more point that should be stated: Wang Chonghui and others proposed the following provisions for the rights shared by the central and local governments: "The following matters shall be legislated and implemented by the central government, or delegated to the province for implementation." The final revised version of the constitution draft review committee added the word "county" under the word "province" and added "General Rules for Provincial and County Autonomy" in the first paragraph. This is a more flexible approach. (End)

### 29 Catholic Faithful Martyred in the Boxer Rebellion Listed as "Blessed," the Canonization Ceremony Will be Presided Over by the Pope Himself

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Twenty-nine martyred clergy and faithful of the Catholic Church were canonized as "Blessed" at 6:00 PM on the 24th. The canonization ceremony will be presided over by the Pope himself and will be solemnly held in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Among the 29 people, there were 15 European missionaries and 14 Chinese clergy and faithful, all of whom sacrificed in the Boxer Rebellion in July 1900. The places of martyrdom were near Hengyang and Taiyuan. When Archbishop Gan Bin announced the news during the Sunday Mass ceremony this morning, he said: Today is one of the most glorious days after China's victory. The holy martyrs are the practitioners who love God above all things. The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the faithful. He also encouraged the faithful to follow in the footsteps of the martyrs, cultivate their minds and nature, build virtue and establish merit, in order to cooperate with the nation-building work. At the end, Yu said: During the Boxer Rebellion, a total of 2,418 people died for their faith in Catholicism. Today's canonization of 29 people is the first batch selected from among them. He also said: Compared with six years ago, the number of Catholics has increased from more than 600,000 to more than 4 million, the number of middle schools has increased from one to more than 200, and three universities have also been established. According to the Catholic canonization, there are three levels: the first level is "Venerable," the second level is "Blessed," and the third level is "Saint." If there are two miraculous manifestations of those listed as "Blessed," they can be elevated to the status of saint.

### Impacted by American Goods Dumping, Hong Kong Factories Close Down One After Another; Rising Unemployment Becomes a Serious Issue

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 24th] Hong Kong's industry is facing a serious crisis due to the dumping of American goods. In the textile industry, the government's ban on the export of yarn and cotton fabrics has led to a stockpile of hundreds of thousands of yards of fabric, which cannot be sold. Most factories have announced shutdowns. The rubber manufacturing industry, which once flourished after the war, has recently seen a reduction in domestic and foreign sales. Several small-scale factories have already closed down. The output of match factories is not as cheap and high-quality as American goods, and sales in Hong Kong are obstructed. The Southeast Asian market has also lost most of its share, so it is almost at a standstill. Due to the economic downturn in industry, factories are closing down one after another, and the number of unemployed people is increasing, which has become a serious problem in Hong Kong today.

### Editorial: Starting with the Participation of the Democratic Socialist Party in the National Assembly

The National Assembly opened on the 15th, and a week has suddenly passed. The issue of the presidium's personnel selection and the agenda have both been decided in the past week. Today's first general assembly has moved from the preparatory meeting to the formal opening stage. At the same time, the foundation of the National Assembly is also expanding day by day. Social elites and the Youth Party advocated in the past and first put forward a list of representatives to participate in the National Assembly. Now, forty representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party also reported yesterday afternoon, and all will attend the first general assembly today, making this National Assembly a truly inclusive forum for various opinions, which is the most gratifying phenomenon in the current open political situation. This is certainly due to the wise decision of Zhang Junmai, the leader of the Democratic Socialist Party, but it is still impossible not to attribute it to the government's selfless spirit. The CCP has always maintained an uncompromising attitude towards the convening of the National Assembly. First, it tried every means to obstruct the opening of the National Assembly; later, it tried every means to undermine the constitutional work of the National Assembly. However, the government has endured and conceded again and again, even to the point of "enduring what others cannot endure and conceding what others cannot concede." It still retains its representative quota and opens the door of the National Assembly, sincerely hoping that the CCP can come to its senses and participate in the constitutional work of the National Assembly. It is a powerful guarantee for Chinese politics to embark on democracy and the rule of law that the Kuomintang, as a ruling party in power, has such a "public spirit for all."

However, the CCP insisted on saying about the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the National Assembly: "This is just the Democratic Socialist Party helping the Kuomintang to thoroughly destroy the Political Consultative Conference." Then it said: "After the Democratic Socialist Party participated in the National Assembly, it did not change the monopolistic nature of the National Assembly by one party." No one can believe the CCP spokesman's nonsense, and there is no value in arguing. The CCP's attempt to undermine the constitutional work of the National Assembly is obvious; this style of persistence will eventually lead to the alienation of the masses. The CCP's stubbornness and refusal to participate in the National Assembly is tantamount to abandoning itself and cutting itself off from the people of the country. We really feel sorry for it. The CCP is not short of high-minded people, so why must it take such a bad strategy? It is really puzzling.

We originally thought that the Democratic Socialist Party's decision to participate in the National Assembly and the publication of the letters exchanged between its leader Zhang Junmai and Chairman Chiang would definitely move other leaders of the Democratic League, and following the Democratic Socialist Party, participate in the constitutional work of the National Assembly. However, after reading the written statement issued by the Democratic League yesterday, clarifying the Democratic League's attitude towards the National Assembly, there are two main points: (1) According to the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference, the Democratic League insisted on "the National Congress should be convened in accordance with the agreed steps, and the constitution should be formulated in accordance with the agreed draft," so it refused to participate in the National Assembly. (2) It opposes civil war and believes that "in today's Chinese political reality, the two parties of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party must first seek a cessation of armed conflict, and then there will be peace; only with peace can there be constitutional government and democracy." Therefore, the Democratic League will continue to maintain its independent status. We cannot help but feel sorry for the Democratic League. The Democratic League has always regarded itself as a third party, and still claims to be in a detached position. Why is it willing to echo the CCP's views and refuse to participate in the National Assembly? It is really too disappointing. Therefore, we still want to ask the leaders of the Democratic League to think again.

First, the Democratic League stated that the two principles it adheres to are to protect the Political Consultative Conference and to oppose civil war. After reading the letter from Zhang Junmai, the leader of the Democratic Socialist Party, to Chairman Chiang, its main idea is also the same. Moreover, it put forward concrete plans on how to implement the ceasefire order and how to realize the Political Consultative Conference resolution, which is even more urgent than the Democratic League's desire for peace and democracy. However, after Chairman Chiang replied that he adopted its proposal, the Democratic Socialist Party submitted a list of forty representatives, who reported yesterday and formally attended the National Assembly from today. Why can't the Democratic League participate? Is there another difficulty?

Second, the Democratic League calls the Political Consultative Conference resolution the "Great Charter," but considers the National Assembly convened this time to have "violated the entire spirit of the Political Consultative Conference resolution, destroyed the procedures of the Political Consultative Conference resolution, and is not a constitutional conference for national unity." This tune of blindly echoing the CCP only shows that the Democratic League's attitude has not been detached, and it still cannot clearly distinguish between right and wrong, which is a loss of its position. It is very clear that the Political Consultative Conference resolution cannot be regarded as a "constitution draft" in legal terms, because we pointed out at the time that the nature of the Political Consultative Conference was a political measure to resolve party disputes, only to enable all parties to exchange opinions and reach a common conclusion. Therefore, the Political Consultative Conference resolution does not involve law at all, let alone calling it a "charter"! However, the reason why all parties respect the Political Consultative Conference resolution is due to the political responsibility borne by all parties. Before the opening of the National Assembly, Chairman Chiang repeatedly solemnly stated that the government was determined to abide by the Political Consultative Conference resolution and ensure its implementation. After the opening of the National Assembly, the draft amendment to the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft, which was drafted in accordance with the Political Consultative Conference resolution, was also passed by the Legislative Yuan. At the same time, the Central Standing Committee and the National Defense Supreme Committee of the Kuomintang recently passed the amendments to the National Government Organization Law and the Executive Yuan Organization Law, fully demonstrating the spirit of abiding by the Political Consultative Conference resolution.

Third, a new political style of respecting each other and being incompatible with each other has been created by the convening of the National Assembly, especially the government authorities, who are showing the spirit of doing their best. The parties that shout slogans such as peace and democracy are often not truly peace-loving and democratic parties; the CCP touts the Political Consultative Conference resolution everywhere, but in practice, it is just "empty talk." At present, the government is the one that truly abides by the Political Consultative Conference resolution. Please see the following facts. (1) The government also knows that "there must be peace before there can be constitutional government." Before the opening of the National Assembly, it had already automatically and unconditionally issued a ceasefire order. If the CCP can put the country first and truly desire peace and democracy, the domestic conflict can be stopped immediately. So where should the responsibility for the failure to stop the war be attributed? It goes without saying. (2) The government is eager to convene the National Assembly, not because it holds power and refuses to let go, but to end political tutelage as soon as possible and return power to the people. At the same time, after the Chinese National Assembly formulates a practical and feasible democratic constitution, it can enter the normal track of constitutional government. There is no reason for any party to oppose this intention of the government. (3) The only task of this National Assembly is to formulate a practical and feasible democratic constitution. The Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft is inevitably out of touch with the times due to the long time interval. Therefore, the Legislative Yuan has also passed an amendment to the constitution draft in accordance with the spirit of the Political Consultative Conference resolution. No matter from which angle it is observed, the government's measures not only fully demonstrate the spirit of abiding by the Political Consultative Conference resolution, but also demonstrate the government's progressive spirit. (4) During the National Assembly session, the government also automatically carried out the work of reorganizing the National Government and the Executive Yuan. The amendments to the National Government and Executive Yuan Organization Law passed by the Central Standing Committee and the National Defense Committee are also based on the Political Consultative Conference resolution. Once the National Assembly closes, the reorganization of the government can be fully realized.

In short, since the Democratic Socialist Party is a member of the Democratic League, its views are also the views of the Democratic League. In fact, after reading the letter from Zhang Junmai to Chairman Chiang and the written statement issued by the Democratic League yesterday, it is not difficult to understand that the views of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Democratic League are completely consistent. Forty of the 120 representatives of the Democratic League have participated in the National Assembly. Why do the remaining 80 still refuse to participate? Since the Democratic League opposes political parties resolving problems on the battlefield, it should participate in this forum that encompasses various opinions, integrating various good opinions, compromising to the right, in order to seek a reasonable solution to various problems. This is the only wide road to make Chinese politics embark on democracy and peace.

### The Coal Mine Strike in the United States

American coal miners recently went on strike because their demands for higher wages were not fully met. According to a Washington dispatch from the Associated Press on the 22nd, the president of the Mine Workers Union, Lewis, remains extremely firm and determined to fight for a legitimate strike. The court has issued a summons. If Lewis orders the miners to return to work before the 25th, he can avoid punishment; otherwise, he will be tried on the morning of the 27th. At the same time, various government departments have taken emergency measures to suspend freight transport and implement power conservation. The Director of the Civilian Production Administration, Small, warned that the lack of coal would devastate the national economy. The seriousness of the general situation can be imagined.

The United States is the most highly industrialized country in the world. Coal is the force that drives all industries and is an indispensable necessity for the people's lives. This strike by 400,000 coal miners will undoubtedly be the biggest blow to the country's economic life. Moreover, the coal miners' union is the key to other unions. An increase in coal miners' wages often leads other workers to make the same demands. The US government does not dare to agree easily, fearing that it will incite nationwide industrial unrest. In fact, the coal miners' request for an additional two dollars a day and improvements in other benefits are not too harsh. However, once the strike wind starts, the government will be unable to control it in the future every time it succumbs. Since May of this year, the US federal government has directly managed the coal industry through the Department of the Interior because there have been too many coal miner strikes, which have affected the national economy. If this strike cannot be quelled, it will prove the incompetence of the federal government.

According to the current situation, both sides are going to extremes. The government is determined to adopt a policy of oppression, and the union is determined to fight for the right to control. The court's threat to Lewis is unlikely to have much effect, because as the leader of the union, Lewis will not be afraid of personal sacrifice. Moreover, since the Republican Party's election victory, President Truman's cancellation of price controls, and workers' wages are not enough to maintain a life that keeps up with rising prices, it is also the truth. If the government insists on its own way, engages in oppression, and does not change the lives of workers from the root, I am afraid that more adverse effects will occur. As for the workers, regardless of the economic life of the people of the country, strikes at every turn, and holding them for a long time will also be subject to the accusations of the people of the country. Only if both sides make concessions can this storm be calmed.

From an international perspective, if this strike is not resolved as soon as possible, the whole world will suffer disaster. After World War II, the United States was the only country with perfect industrial equipment and was not destroyed by the war. The United States is not only able to produce enough finished products and materials for the lives of its own people, but also has a surplus to relieve the suffering people of the world and help countries gradually restore their pre-war economic life. The United States has contributed 2.7 billion US dollars to the United Relief Agency, and loans to various countries have reached 15 billion US dollars so far. These large donations and loaned US dollars are actually not banknotes, but the surplus materials of the United States. If the United States' domestic industry is devastated, the whole world will not receive relief, and the loaned and about-to-be-loaned funds will be equal to waste paper.

The world's economy is now interdependent. US Senator Thomas believes that only when the economies of all countries in the world prosper can the US economy prosper. Conversely, if the US economy is hit, the world's economy will also be hit. The impact of this strike is the most obvious, because once the United States is short of fuel, American finished products and materials cannot be exported in large quantities, and even after-war relief will become a problem.

Moreover, since the end of the war, the whole world has been experiencing a coal shortage. For example, the Ruhr area of Germany could export 31 million tons to foreign countries annually before the war in addition to its own use, but this year it can only export 13 million tons. The Soviet Union's coal production is only 50% of that before the war, so of course there is no export. Europe needs 38.5 million tons of coal, and it can only produce 72% itself. Imports from the United States and the United Kingdom only account for 6%, leaving a shortfall of 22%. However, the 22 million tons of coal that the United States exported to Europe already represents 5% of the total production of the United States. Before the war, the United States only exported 3% to Europe. Europe is still eager for the United States to increase production and export a large amount to relieve the European coal shortage.

From all aspects, this strike by American coal miners is very serious. If this is not handled properly and multiple strikes continue to brew, the serious threat will still not be lifted. We hope that the US government authorities and the president of the United Mine Workers of America, Lewis, will think from a big picture perspective and not insist on their own opinions.

### Wuhu Scoundrels Cannot Escape the Law; Thirty-Three Traitors Wanted; Suzhou High Procuratorate Office Warrants Three Puppet Tax Officials

[Our newspaper, Wuhu] The Third Branch of the Wuhu High Court still has hundreds of traitors detained who have not been tried. Therefore, the cases involved are also widespread, and major traitors have taken advantage of the chaos to transfer their positions in many ways, and even changed their names, posing as those from the rear, doing their business greatly and living a prosperous life. Recently, the High Court issued an arrest warrant for a group of Wuhu fugitive traitors, totaling thirty-three people, most of whom are important figures with heinous crimes known to the people of Anhui. They include: Li Long, chairman of the puppet Wuhu Chamber of Commerce; Cai Gongyi, general manager of the puppet Yuhua Alliance Company; Cai Yongmei, chairman of the puppet Yangzi Company; Tao Xifen, translator of the Japanese Consulate; Da Shaoguang, chairman of the puppet Wuhu No-Goods Association; Liu Zijing, captain of the puppet Wuhu Security Brigade; Liu Fanghua, compradore of the Japanese Dry Goods Store; Zhou Jingchun, chief of the Japanese Military Transportation Corps; Zhou Zhikuan, head of the secret service of the Japanese Military Police Headquarters; Jiang Jiakuan, secret agent of the Japanese Military Headquarters; Tao Bangdong, captain of the puppet People's Self-Defense Brigade; Zhan Shan, head of the puppet Fifth District; Ling Shunqi, captain of the puppet Wuhu Sixth Security Team; Tao Tiehua, captain of the Qingshuihe Enemy Reconnaissance Team; Xia Yingzhou, captain of the puppet Wuhu Security Eighth Squadron; Xue Jianmin, captain of the puppet Wuhu Yitai Township Second Team; Zhai Dazhi, head of the puppet Wuhu Second District; Zhang Qijin, director of the puppet Huangchi Cooperative; Hong Jiuwen, secretary of the puppet Wuhu County Government and magistrate of Dangtu County; Huang Dezhi, head of the puppet Fanchang Three Township Self-Defense Regiment; Zhu Dexian, employee of the Japanese Foreign Firm; Hong Xinhua, chief of the first battalion of special agents of Lin Nisheng; Xie Yulin, director of the puppet Anhui Provincial Department of Education; Fang Jiwen, purchasing agent of the puppet Central China Transportation Company; Meng Xiangyi, purchasing agent of the enemy Mitsubishi Company; Chen Bu, director of the puppet Wuhu Cooperative Warehouse; Liu Zizhu, director of the puppet Money Industry; Zhang Silang, magistrate of the puppet Dangtu County; Zhang Zhu Hongzhen, a female traitor who forced her husband Zhang Zong to serve as the captain of the puppet Security Regiment; Zhang Xingcai, director of the puppet Dangtu Relief Home; Zhou Chengde, section chief of the puppet Dangtu County Government; Zhan Jiawang, secret agent of the enemy Wuhu Gendarmerie; and Zhou Fengchi, head of the puppet Wuhu Baisha Township.

[Our newspaper, Suzhou] Wu Ni Xiangguang, the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Income Tax Bureau Director, Wang Ni Zhisheng, director of the puppet Wujiang Wuxi Taxation Management Office, and director of the puppet Nantong Anti-Smoking Bureau, all illegally collected taxes from the enemy and puppets, and exploited the people. After the victory, someone reported to the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau, and the Suzhou Branch of the Bureau forwarded it to the Suzhou High Procuratorate Office for investigation. However, the defendants had already fled and could not be arrested. Now, after the Suzhou High Procuratorate Office concluded the investigation, not only did the original informants accuse the two traitors of their crimes in detail, but they also ordered the police to arrest them many times, but they did not appear in court, showing that they were obviously afraid of guilt and fleeing. Based on the puppet positions they held, it can be imagined that their actions were beneficial to the enemy and puppets and detrimental to our country and the people. Therefore, on the 21st, they were prosecuted and wanted in accordance with the law.

### Sensational Case in Lixia: The Flying Thief Li Shengwu Case Concludes with Indictment

[Our Jinan Report] The sensational case of the flying thief Li Shengwu (also known as Yanzi Li San) in Lixia has concluded after repeated investigations by the Jinan District Court. It has been learned that the main suspect in the case, Li Shengwu, and the harborer, Li Qinlu, have been indicted by Wu Tingxian, the prosecutor of the Jinan District Court. The indictment lists the facts, evidence, and legal provisions of the crimes committed by Li and others, as follows:

Facts of the Crime: Li Shengwu (also known as Li Shengyuan), also known as Li Tuzi, is from Yucheng County and formerly resided in Shenjia Alley, Qinglong Street, Dongguan. He made theft his regular occupation. In May of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), he stole 47 pieces of goldware from Qingbao Silver Shop on Ximen Street, weighing 24 taels and 6 mace, 169 taels of silver bars, and other items. He was subsequently arrested while selling them and sentenced to one year of imprisonment by the puppet court. Before completing his sentence, he was released on amnesty in May of the 34th year of the Republic (1945) (records available). However, his thieving nature was difficult to change. In June, he stole 20 bolts of spun silk from the Huacheng Cloth Shop on Wei 4th Road and 38 yards of clothing material from Hongshun Tailor Shop. On August 2nd, he stole two gold rings and a dozen watches from the Meizuishi Watch Shop. He committed numerous crimes and spent lavishly. He then stole a handgun from somewhere on Sima Road and hid it inside the German consulate, becoming like a tiger with wings. When the police officers discovered this, detectives Xue Liwen and Zhang Chunting worked together to arrest him. However, he managed to escape while in shackles during the journey. He then resisted arrest with a gun inside the Daguan Garden. Only then did he realize that he was being watched by the military police, so he fled with his family. In May of this month, he secretly came to Jinan. Because of his addiction to opium, he had become acquainted with Li Qinlu, who secretly ran an opium den, and hid there, waiting for an opportunity to act. He deeply resented Xue Liwen and others for arresting him and had long harbored murderous intentions. He then bought a handgun from a Zhang-surnamed opium smoker at Li Qinlu's place and went to seek revenge. On the night of May 8th of this year, while Xue Liwen was out on duty, he killed his mother, He, and his wife, Sun, leaving two spent bullet casings as a deliberate mark. This was reported to the court for verification (records available), and a warrant was issued for his arrest. Li Qinlu learned of this and repeatedly extorted money from him, which angered Li Shengwu. He lured Li Qinlu into the street and shot him four times, hoping to eliminate the evidence (medical report attached). However, seeing that his goal was not achieved, he fled again. Eventually, Li Shengwu returned to this city. On the 5th of this month, he encountered Zhang Chunting and others on Guanyi Street. In a panic, he fled, injuring his left foot, and was finally arrested. Li Qinlu and others were summoned to the bureau and sent to the court together.

Criminal Laws: The defendant in this case, Li Shengwu, confessed without dispute that he had been stealing for many years and had purchased a handgun to commit murder and escape. There are verification reports, medical reports, and arrest warrants as evidence. The facts of the crime are sufficient to be confirmed. As for Li Qinlu, he not only provided a place for people to smoke opium but also deliberately harbored a criminal. He has been clearly identified by Li Shengwu in court. Although he was shot by Li Shengwu and did not die, he should still be judged according to the law. Regarding their actions, Li Shengwu's murder constitutes a crime under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. His attempted murder, possession of military firearms, theft, and escape constitute crimes under Paragraph 2 of the same article and Articles 186, 322, and 161, Paragraph 2 of the same law. Except that the possession of military firearms is jointly related to others and should be punished for the most serious crime according to Article 55 of the same law, the remaining crimes should be prosecuted jointly according to Article 5 of the same law. Li Qinlu's actions constitute a crime under Article 164, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and according to Article 38, Paragraph 1, Items 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law, the two spent bullet casings should be confiscated. Except for the defendant's opium-related matters, which will be handled in a separate case, this indictment is filed according to Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

### Rail Fracture Near Waikuatang

Fortunately, No Accident Occurred and Was Immediately Repaired

[Our Suzhou Report on the 24th] A rail fracture was discovered near Waikuatang on the Jinghu Line between the 87th and 88th foreign bridges after the seventh express train heading downwards passed today. The cause is unknown. Fortunately, no accident occurred. The Suzhou Station took emergency measures, notifying the 74th passenger train heading upwards to slow down, and immediately dispatched workers to repair it. The repairs have now been completed. Trains have been delayed by two hours starting with the 74th passenger train.

### Enemy Property in Qingpu Stolen and Sold Out

Military Authorities Dispatch Personnel to the County for Thorough Investigation

[Our Qingpu Report] After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the enemy troops stationed in this county left behind a large amount of supplies, including steel, rice, wheat, salt, etc. The quantity was considerable, and the value must have been tens of millions of yuan or more. When the enemy troops surrendered their weapons and withdrew, they submitted a list of items transferred to our military and political authorities. These large quantities of enemy property were scattered in Sheshan, the urban area, Zhujiajiao, and other places in this county, lasting for over a year now. It is expected that in this year or so, the persons in charge at the time colluded with unscrupulous elements in local agencies to continuously steal and sell out the enemy property. Recently, the military authorities discovered this and were greatly angered, so on the 19th of this month, they dispatched Colonel Inspector Yin Xiangfan to the county to thoroughly investigate the truth. Sun Rongsheng, a local who runs a shipping business, once sold 68 dan of salt for them at a low price of 13,000 yuan per dan to Xiangfa Mill in this city. Sun Rongsheng has been arrested by Inspector Yin and detained in the county police station. The other stolen and sold goods are being investigated separately.

### Suppression of Bandits in Jiangyin Second Phase of Suppression in Wujiang

[Our Jiangyin Report on the 24th] Commander Kong Jianqing Gui and County Magistrate Fang, etc., led a team to the Zhutang area in the eastern countryside on the morning of the 24th to supervise the suppression of scattered bandits and to check household registrations to maintain治安.

[Our Wujiang Report] This county borders Lake Tai, and its ports are numerous, making it a place where bandits frequently appear. Suppressing them here and there is a hidden danger to the locality. Previously, the county government mobilized local forces to suppress them, and they have slightly reduced their activities. County Magistrate Gu Hongxi, during this winter defense period, is still worried that the scattered bandits will stir up trouble and endanger rural security. In addition to appointing Chen Dezhao, who is familiar with the geography of the lakefront, as the District Head of Pingwang, to plan military affairs, he concentrated the county's military police and teams, devoting all their efforts to carry out the second phase of suppression. Liang Xi, the head of the Self-Defense Corps, was appointed as the commander-in-chief, stationed in Hengjing. The Provincial Water Police and Security Team were stationed in Wudang, Damiao Port, and other places. On one hand, they are conducting a district-by-district investigation and registration of civilian boats to prevent bandits from mingling in. The Suzhou Suppression Headquarters also sent Staff Officer Chen and others to the county for guidance.

### Two Major Conferences in Songjiang: Review of County Administration in the Third District of Jiangsu Province, Review of Finances in the Third and Fourth Districts

[Our Songjiang Report] The Third District Administrative Inspectorate convened a conference on the 22nd, gathering the county magistrates of the counties under its jurisdiction: Songjiang, Jinshan, Qingpu, Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Shanghai, Jiading, and Chongming. Ge Jianshi, a member of the Provincial Government, attended to provide guidance. Commissioner Xie presided over the meeting. In the morning, the county magistrates of the nine attending counties reported on the current status of their work. In the afternoon, Commander Li of the Corps Area attended the meeting to report. Regarding the counties that have not met their conscription quota, they must complete the conscription and send the recruits by the 25th. Then, county administration issues were discussed, such as formulating self-defense capabilities, strengthening defenses, eliminating bandits, ensuring security, and improving the treatment of administrative personnel, increasing primary school funding, and administrative, conscription, food requisition, and financial matters were all discussed in detail. It was also suggested that after the County Autonomous Tax Bureau was reorganized into the Autonomous Tax Collection Bureau, it became directly under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Government. A joint request will be submitted to the province to return the Tax Bureau to its original system, under the jurisdiction of the county administration. In addition, the financial review conference was held on the 23rd in the Zhongshan Memorial Hall in the County Government, gathering Commissioner Xie Chengbing of the Third District, Commissioner Xu Mojia of the Fourth District, and the county magistrates, finance section chiefs, and tax collection bureau directors of the counties under their jurisdiction to review the finances. Director Dong Zhe of the Provincial Finance Department specially presided over the meeting. The scope of the review was to actively consolidate provincial and county finances to achieve self-sufficiency.

### Symposium on Military Service Held in Wuxing: Request for Prompt Issuance of Resettlement Allowances, Suzhou Strictly Limits the Completion of Conscription by the End of the Month

[Our Wuxing Report] Commander Xia Jiping of the Zhejiang North Garrison District came to Huzhou from Hangzhou on the 19th to supervise military administration. The next morning at 9:00 AM, he convened a symposium in the Second District Commissioner's Office, gathering the heads of Party, government, military, judicial, and legal organs. Commander Xia delivered a speech, stating the various meanings of establishing national defense forces, and reviewed the malpractices of conscription and the future improvement of conscription management methods. Then, Section Chief Wang of the Military Affairs Section of the County Government reported on the progress of the conscription work ordered, and incidentally requested Commander Xia to promptly issue resettlement allowances for the new recruits, which was promised to be forwarded. Also, the County Government, considering that the recruitment period for new recruits is approaching, organized a conscription committee in accordance with the provisions of the Military Service Law to facilitate military administration. They specially invited responsible persons from relevant legal groups and local gentry to meet at 2:00 PM on the 24th to discuss the matter.

[Our Haining Report] The Jiaxing Garrison District Command, in order to study practical military service issues and listen to reports from various counties on the conscription of new recruits, specifically scheduled a meeting of military section chiefs from each county in the Tenth District. The military section chief of this county went to He on the 23rd.

[Our Suzhou Report] This county has been ordered to handle the temporary conscription of 980 people. Because of the urgent time and the fact that many handlers are not familiar with the detailed procedures, it has been repeatedly extended. According to statistics, as of the 22nd, there are still more than 200 new recruits missing. The County Government of this county has issued another order to each district, setting the end of this month as the final deadline, strictly ordering each district to complete the conscription within the deadline. If there is any further delay, they will be punished in accordance with the regulations for punishing those who obstruct military service, who neglect military service laws, and who fail to conscript and send new recruits within the prescribed time limit, with imprisonment of up to six years.

### A Fierce Bandit Executed by Firing Squad in Zhangzhu

[Our Zhangzhu Report] The bandit criminals Ren Xibao and Wu Guilan, during the Japanese invasion of Zhangzhu in the autumn of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), when our army moved west, murdered Wang Hansheng, the chief of the intelligence section of the 9th company of the 3rd battalion of the 5th regiment, in Dongpan Village, Yuanshan Township, and remained at large. Li Guanghan, the company commander of the 8th company who was with Wang at the time, was fortunate to escape. Recently, the Anti-Banditry Command in the border area of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui received a secret report and dispatched officers to the scene of the incident on the night of the 10th of this month. Ren Xibao and Wu Guilan confessed that they and Ren Liansheng and Hu Sanda, following Ren Xibao's instructions, lured Wang Hansheng to the mulberry garden next to the ancestral hall in the village, stabbed him to death with a sharp knife, and carried the body to Gangshan southwest of the village for burial. Hu Sanda is currently at large, Ren Liansheng has died, and Wu Guilan is in custody. The main culprit, Ren Xibao, was found to have previously served as a Jia head in the bandit army, brutally murdered soldiers fighting against Japan, and privately possessed firearms and weapons, confirming all kinds of illegal acts. He was executed by firing squad on the spot on the 20th, to the delight of those who heard about it. The other traffickers are being investigated, arrested, and severely punished.

### Zhejiang Raises 300 Million Yuan to Provide Winter Relief

[Our Hangzhou Report] The Zhejiang Provincial Government, considering that the cities and counties of this province have previously been ravaged by the enemy, with devastation everywhere, and this autumn has suffered unprecedented wind, insect, and flood disasters, with the affected areas reaching more than 30 counties, almost half of the province, and tens of thousands of disaster victims are in danger of freezing and starvation, making relief efforts urgent, has now approved the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs to actively proceed with the work, and has stipulated that the province raise at least 300 million yuan to provide relief.

### Zhejiang's 1 Billion Fishing Loan Allocated to Three Prefectures Proportionately

[Our Ningbo Report] The Zhejiang Provincial Aquatic Products Construction Association held a Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Taizhou fisheries construction conference at the Ningbo Sixth District Commissioner's Office on the 20th to discuss the allocation of the 1 billion fishing loan. It was decided to allocate it according to the number of fishermen employed in each place and the number of fishing boats, in percentages. Ningbo Prefecture accounts for 55%, Taizhou Prefecture accounts for 25%, and Wenzhou Prefecture accounts for 20%. The allocation to the production cooperatives in the counties of the three prefectures is as follows: Ningbo Prefecture: Dinghai receives 150 million yuan, Fenghua 135 million yuan, Xiangshan 95 million yuan, Zhedong County 75 million yuan, Ninghai 65 million yuan, Zhenhai 30 million yuan. It was later decided to increase Ninghai by 30 million yuan and Zhenhai by 20 million yuan. Taizhou Prefecture: Linhai receives 35%, Wenling 40%, Sanmen 20%, Huangyan 5%. Wenzhou Prefecture: Because no representatives attended, the district will decide on its own.

### Wuxi Cloth Factories Closing Down One After Another

[Our Wuxi Report] Since the beginning of summer in this county, stores on the streets have been calling for price reductions, but because the losses are too great, the number of closures is increasing day by day. The commercial future is deeply worrying. There were originally more than 80 large and small weaving factories in the county. Now, due to the authorities' control of raw materials and poor sales, more than 20 factories, including Wanxiang, have closed down in the past month alone. The silk factories are even worse. If no measures are taken to provide relief, the future is unimaginable.

### Local News Briefs

Ningbo Report: After the Mei Lake in Dongqian Lake in this county was stopped for reclamation, the reclaimers were transferred to Wanniantang in Zhanqi Town by a resolution of the Second County Council to provide relief.

Haining Report: This county is the transportation center of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway.

### Result of the Petition by the Grain Industry in Zhejiang Province: Grain Business Tax Exempted

[Our Haining Report] Jieshi Town in this county is an important distribution center for rice and grain in Zhejiang Province. Previously, it jointly initiated a petition with the grain industry in Hangzhou to request exemption from grain business tax. Representatives were elected from the grain industry throughout the province and sent to the relevant provincial and central government agencies. In addition, representatives from the Provincial Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to Chairman Chiang, who approved it for handling by the relevant authorities. According to a quick telegram from the representative of this county, the Ministry of Finance, considering that grain is related to people's food and has a great impact on prices, in order to reduce the burden of people's food and stabilize grain and prices, has approved the continued exemption from business tax for one year and will issue another order to that effect. However, the profit tax for the 34th year of the Republic (1945) must still be paid.

### Hospital's Response to the Death of Yan Jinwen's Daughter

Reply to Mr. Yan Jinwen: Your letter expresses your grief and indignation over the death of your sick child, which is truly sympathetic. However, this matter is of great importance to the reputation of the hospital. We have forwarded your letter to the First Red Cross Hospital to inquire whether there was any negligence. The hospital's reply states: "On the morning of the 14th of this month at around 1:00 AM, a person named Yan Jinwen brought a female infant, just over one month old and barely breathing, to the hospital for treatment. The pediatrician on duty immediately examined her. According to the child's parents, 'The child's mother was eight and a half months pregnant when the child was born, making her a premature baby; she has been sick for more than half a month, with abdominal distension and frequent vomiting and crying. Because of superstitious beliefs, she was not sent to the hospital. Now that her condition is critical, she has been brought here for rescue.' After examination by Dr. Liu, it was found that the girl was thin and small, obviously congenitally deficient. Her navel was inflamed, leading to peritonitis, which caused the abdomen to swell like a drum. Moreover, the navel had never closed after the umbilical cord fell off, and liquid was flowing out during the examination. The veins of the umbilical cord were abnormally prominent, indicating a long period of illness. At that time, because the child's condition was serious and she was barely breathing, the nurse was first instructed to give a subcutaneous injection of caffeine sodium benzoate. After the injection, she died. (Note: Caffeine sodium benzoate is a mild and stable cardiac stimulant with neutralizing properties and no fatal toxicity. This can be verified in the pharmacopoeia and by public evaluation by pharmaceutical and medical experts.) The parent, Yan Jinwen, suspected that the injection caused the death and seized the needle bottle, not asking why, and left with the body. Seeing his abnormal behavior, the doctor was afraid that he would take the needle bottle away, leaving no evidence, and asked him to issue a receipt, stating the words 'empty bottle of caffeine sodium benzoate', or to personally wrap, seal, and sign it for evidence, but he refused. Mr. Yu, the duty officer of the hospital's administrative office, seeing that there was no way to reason with him, reported it to the Jing'an Temple District Police Station (the police station was reported by the hospital on its own initiative, and the Jing'an Temple District Police Station has a record of it), requesting them to send someone to the hospital to investigate the truth. Subsequently, on the 15th, the court prosecutor and bailiff legally performed an autopsy, determining that the death was due to illness and ordering the child's family to take the body back for burial. This is the actual situation at the time." According to this, it seems that the child was extremely weak, and medicine was ineffective. For your comfort, you can only try to suppress your grief.

### Xiangde Road Will Restore Light

Reader Ouyang Wenjun wrote to this newspaper stating that Xiangde Road needs light. We have received a reply from the Public Utilities Bureau stating: "Mr. Ouyang's concern for public welfare is greatly appreciated.

Therefore, the Shanghai North Streetlight Management Office of this bureau was ordered to dismantle them and plan to replace them with new light poles. The light poles that have been ordered have now been delivered. The streetlights in that area will be able to restore light before the end of this month." Please wait patiently for the lights to be turned on.

### Echoing the Mechanical Calendar

Yesterday, I read the news in your newspaper about "Yongjia youth Chen Wei inventing a mechanical calendar." I, in my incompetence, also created a solar calendar week conversion calendar in April of this year. If the calendar method does not change, this conversion calendar can also be used for ten thousand years and is extremely convenient, using a disk with a diameter of six centimeters (about two and a half inches) to rotate and convert. I don't know if Mr. Chen Wei's calendar is purely a solar calendar conversion calendar or a lunisolar calendar conversion calendar. I would be grateful if Mr. Chen Wei could answer. (Tang Liangjin)

### Comparison of the Draft Constitution Amendment Before and After Review

News Agency Data Room

The amendment to the draft Constitution of the Republic of China has been passed by the full session of the Legislative Yuan and is expected to be approved by the National Assembly.

The result of the review of the Constitution by the Central Standing Committee and the joint meeting of the five committees of the Legislative Yuan is largely the same as the original amendment, but there are slight changes in several places. For example, the amendment has been increased from 148 articles to 151 articles. For example, Articles 45, 57, 92, 99, and 104 are not found in the original draft amendment, but were newly added during the review. Articles 62 and 91 of the original draft amendment have been deleted, and other textual revisions have been made, with changes to their positions before and after.

Regarding the newly added articles, Article 45 states: "The President, with respect to disputes between the Yuan, may convene a meeting of the heads of the relevant Yuan for consultation to resolve the disputes, except as otherwise provided in this Constitution." The organizations of the government are all interconnected, especially the close relationship between the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan, as stipulated in Article 58. However, the Constitution is the fundamental law of a country, serving only as an outline, and the changes in the political situation of the country cannot be fully covered by the Constitution. The addition of this new article is actually to supplement the shortcomings of Article 58.

The newly added Article 57 is a provision for the appointment of heads of ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan. The original amendment only had provisions for the appointment of the President of the Executive Yuan, but made no mention of the heads of the various ministries and commissions. The executive branch is the institution for implementing various undertakings, and in addition to the President, the heads of the various ministries and commissions are the persons who actually implement government orders, and they must also be stipulated within the Constitution. At the same time, the heads of the various ministries and commissions are the right-hand men of the President of the Executive Yuan, and their nomination by the President of the Executive Yuan can further enhance their assistance.

Article 92 adds the following: "When the Examination Yuan submits a bill on matters under its jurisdiction, the Secretary-General of the Examination Yuan shall attend the Legislative Yuan to explain it." Legislation is the work of the Legislative Yuan, but regarding laws and regulations on examinations, appointments, and personnel administration, the Legislative Yuan sometimes does not know the purpose behind them. If the Examination Yuan can provide explanations, the resulting new laws and regulations can be more practical.

Article 99 states: "When the Control Yuan exercises the power of consent in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution, it shall be done by a resolution of more than half of the members of the entire Yuan." The organization of the Control Yuan is a committee system, and the number of people required to pass a resolution must be explicitly stipulated. In addition to the provisions of Articles 103 and 105, this article supplements them to make them more complete.

In the original draft amendment, the powers of the Control Yuan were limited to the impeachment of central and local administrative personnel. However, judicial and examination personnel may also have illegal or derelict conduct, but they can be treated in the same manner as administrative personnel. However, the express stipulation now makes it clearer and more accurate.

As for the two articles that were deleted, the content of Article 62 of the original draft amendment is the same as the nature of Article 58, paragraph 1 after review, so it can be deleted to avoid duplication. The original Article 91, which was deleted, was about the term of office of the members of the Examination Yuan. The members of the Examination Yuan are nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Control Yuan, which is different from the legislators and controllers directly elected by the people. Since they are not produced by election, there is no need to stipulate a term of office.

The above are all additions and deletions of the entire text. In addition, there are also modifications to some parts. Among the important ones is Article 143, regarding the purpose of education, in addition to the original three items, two items, "national morality" and "sound physique," have been added. Morality has always been the foundation of our country's establishment in the past. In the past, Confucian education focused on cultivating morality, and future education must also pay attention to this. In view of the situation in our country, a sound physique should also be included as necessary, so as to wash away the shame of the "sick man of East Asia" and be able to bear the important responsibility of national construction in the future.

Article 147, regarding the interpretation of laws by the Judicial Yuan when they conflict with the Constitution, the original provision "submitted by the Executive Yuan within six months after the law takes effect" has been deleted. Doubts about conflicts between laws and the Constitution can arise at any time, not necessarily within half a year. If it is rigidly stipulated, what will happen if doubts about conflicts arise after half a year? Now that the stipulated time limit has been deleted, the Judicial Yuan can be requested to interpret doubts at any time in the future.

A paragraph of text has been deleted from both Articles 5 and 11. The main text of Article 5 is: "All ethnic groups in the Republic of China are equal." This already includes everything. The paragraph behind it was originally just an annotation to the previous paragraph, but it seems to have an unclear contradiction, so it is appropriate to delete it. The text deleted from Article 11 is: "Government agencies or troops shall not forcibly occupy civilian houses." Forcibly occupying civilian houses is obstructing the freedom of residence of the people. Since the people have the freedom of residence and movement, there is no need to explain it again.

Article 105, regarding the impeachment of the President by the Control Yuan, the number of members of the Control Yuan who propose it has been increased from ten to one-fourth. The impeachment of the President is a very important matter. If the proposal of ten members of the Control Yuan is felt to be weak, it is now changed to one-fourth. Although the number of members of the Control Yuan is increased on the surface, it actually emphasizes the powers of the members of the Control Yuan.

The above items are all important modifications. Other changes include changing "ethnic autonomous regions" to "Mongolian leagues and Tibet." The original Articles 67 and 68 were moved back and changed to Articles 78 and 79. These are not of great significance and will not be discussed separately. (End)

### The Five-Power Conference Creates a Divided Situation, the Soviet Union Firmly Rejects Limiting the Veto Power, the Whole Case Will Be Returned to the United Nations General Assembly for Discussion

[Special dispatch from our reporter in New York, 24th] At a meeting of the five powers held yesterday at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov rejected the Western allies' proposal to limit the veto power in the Security Council. Mr. Molotov's firm attitude will inevitably lead to the failure of future attempts by small countries to demand amendments to the United Nations voting procedures, and at the same time the movement to restrict the use of the veto power will come to an end. Secretary of State Byrnes and British Foreign Secretary Bevin advocated the establishment of an agreement to abolish the use of the veto power for smaller matters. Bevin argued that the Security Council should make every effort to reach an agreement before putting questions that might involve the veto power to a vote. Chinese representative Gu Weijun and French representative Baradot also seconded Bevin's proposal. But Molotov insisted on his original position, demanding that the General Assembly not accept any proposals to limit the veto power. At this time, Bevin stood up and said: It is futile to continue discussing this matter, and the meeting ended.

[United Press New York, 23rd] At today's secret meeting of the five powers, the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov frankly rejected the efforts made by the four countries of the United States, Britain, China and France to discuss restricting the use of the veto power, creating a divided situation among the five powers, and the whole case will be returned to the United Nations General Assembly. According to Western diplomats who attended the meeting, Molotov clashed with the other four powers' representatives. At the beginning of the meeting, Mr. Molotov asked other representatives to pass a motion declaring opposition to restricting the veto power stipulated in the United Nations Charter, and opposed adding it to the United Nations organization in a rigid form, and advocated promoting coordination among the United Nations. Molotov suggested submitting this draft sacrifice to the United Nations General Assembly for adoption. It is said that there are many opinions on the voting system of the Security Council, and the General Assembly should immediately take definite action to support it. British Foreign Secretary Bevin. US Secretary of State Byrnes, Chinese representative Gu Weijun and French representative Baradot all believed that Molotov's proposal was unacceptable. However, judging from the wording of Molotov's proposal and his firm demand that the General Assembly take action, there is no doubt that when the General Assembly discusses this issue, the Soviet Union will use the strongest sentence to demand the rejection of all criticisms of the veto power.

[Our newspaper] San Francisco, 24th broadcast: Today is Sunday, the United Nations General Assembly and the Foreign Ministers Conference are both closed, but the representatives of the four countries of China, Britain, the United States and France held informal talks to discuss how to deal with the situation caused by the Soviet Union's refusal to accept the veto power amendment.

### Our Country Suffered the Most Damage During the War, Japan's Compensation Should Be Higher, Our Representative to the Far East Commission Clarifies His Position

[United Press Washington, 23rd] The countries in the Pacific that suffered war losses are eager to use Japan's industrial compensation as a source of materials for reconstruction. The United States is continuing its efforts to have the Japanese compensation issue discussed in early December to find a solution and implement it. Countries demanding compensation are now making preliminary estimates of compensation, but difficult problems are emerging one after another. There are two new difficult problems: (1) Should the Japanese assets within the borders of the countries applying for compensation be included in the total compensation value for all countries? (2) How should the Japanese existing property that Sernian moved away from the territory of the Nine Provinces of Northeast China be calculated? It is now known that China and the Philippines believe that this property should not be included in the total compensation project, but should belong to the country where the property is located, and the property in Japan should be allocated to meet the compensation requirements of these countries. This attitude is different from that of the United States, which insists that all Japanese assets, no matter in which country, should be included in the total compensation project. The Chinese representative explained China's position in the Far East Committee, saying: "China is concerned about everything in Japan that can compensate for our war losses, because we suffered the most damage among the countries participating in the Pacific War; we require various assets from Japan. There are more than other countries. We are eager to obtain anything of value to us. China has no intention of intimidating or retaliating against Japan, but only seeks fairness for itself." The Middle and Philippine countries are preparing to open a list of war items to Japan, including Japanese industrial assets, such as shipyards, dry docks, cement plants, paper mills, mining equipment, expansion copper plants, power plants, coconut oil plants, fishing boats, lumber mill equipment, woodworking machinery, textile factories, etc. It is reported that the Philippines hopes to obtain at least 1 billion US dollars worth of Japanese assets; however, the United States will advocate that Japan retain appropriate industries and assets to maintain its economic life. At the same time, it advocates that Japanese assets in North Korea should be kept intact.

Although it is strictly prohibited by law to sell women from good families as prostitutes, general brothel owners still openly violate it; therefore, the dens of iniquity in major cities are crowded with customers.

### Truman Returns to Capital for Meeting;

High-Level Discussions on Addressing Coal Mine Strike;

Government Advocates Nationwide Coal Rationing

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 23rd] President Truman returned to the capital from Key West City this afternoon and immediately met with Labor Secretary Schwellenbach to discuss the ongoing coal mine strike. Several senior government officials also participated.

[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd] President Truman, who had been on vacation in Florida for a week, returned here today and told reporters that a meeting would be held to discuss the coal mine strike. At the same time, the government advocates strict implementation of coal rationing throughout the country. Various indications suggest that this strike may be protracted, leading to a tough battle with Lewis and the United Mine Workers of America he leads. Interior Secretary Krug has telegraphed the governors of all forty-eight states, suggesting restrictions on industrial power use and the implementation of electricity conservation measures that are more extensive than previous orders. In areas with low coal reserves, entertainment venues will be closed altogether, and even schools may be closed. The court is scheduled to hear Lewis's appeal against the injunction on Monday. Lewis's legal representatives and the Department of Justice are actively preparing for the debate. Truman returned to the capital to personally direct the implementation of the order to fight Lewis to the end and will hold a series of formal meetings to find ways to prevent the total shutdown of four hundred thousand bituminous coal miners. Despite being summoned for contempt of court, Lewis has not indicated that he will order a return to work.

[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] Senior U.S. government officials predict that the U.S. coal mine strike will affect the political situation in Western Europe. Although they do not believe that the United States is using fuel and food as political weapons, they also acknowledge that these two items are important political issues in Europe today. If the United States cannot fulfill its anti-famine plan, its foreign relations will inevitably suffer.

### Surplus of Male Stars in Hollywood;

Plain-Looking Young Women Seize the Opportunity to Rise

[Associated Press, Hollywood, 23rd] The movie capital is constantly changing. During the war, male stars were as rare as phoenix feathers because young men had joined the army, and the remaining men were either too old or too young, resulting in female stars dominating films. Now that the war is over, the situation has completely reversed, with male stars as numerous as the grains of sand in the river. Because the young boys during the war have matured, and the soldiers who enlisted have also returned home, resulting in a surplus of talent. As a result, top leading men such as Clark Gable, Robert Taylor, Tyrone Power, etc., are all starting to become overshadowed; while the wartime female actors are aging, creating a gap between generations. Young girls like Ge Aite, Lin Fusi, and Bei Dai, who have no outstanding works, have surprisingly risen to prominence. Companies are recruiting up-and-coming female stars, and with demand exceeding supply, girls have an opportunity to advance.

### The Indian Political Situation Is Becoming Increasingly Serious

Nehru Demands Punishment of British-Indian Officials

[Reuters, Meerut, United Provinces, India, 23rd] Indian Interim Government Vice President Nehru, in a speech at the Congress Party conference today, demanded the punishment of British-Indian officials involved in the 1942 incident (when Congress Party leaders launched the "Quit India" movement and Nehru and others were imprisoned). He revealed that the Viceroy of India, Wavell, had suggested to him not to suppress officials, to which he replied that he had no intention of oppressing officials but would not compromise with officials who were at fault in the 1942 case, regardless of whether they were British or Indian. Nehru further stated that although the British in India were loudly proclaiming their withdrawal from India, they were actually conspiring to sabotage India's plans. However, India's enemies are not limited to the British; there are also internal enemies. In the struggle for India's liberation, these enemies must be eliminated, and corrupt elements must be eradicated. Another Congress Party leader, Patel, called for an end to the riots to avoid harming the nation's vitality and India's reputation. He said that success can only be achieved by using peaceful and benevolent methods, and violence will inevitably encounter violence. The partition plan of India cannot be implemented by force; otherwise, India will never have peace.

[Central News Agency, Meerut, India, 23rd Special Dispatch] Since Nehru revealed the conflict between the Indian Interim Government and Jinnah's statement, the Indian political situation has become increasingly tense. Jinnah's statement was issued last Thursday when Muslim League members refused to participate in the Constituent Assembly, and the seriousness of the political situation seems to have reached a peak. Jinnah declared, "Under no circumstances do we want to withdraw from the Indian government." If the Congress Party's resolution demanding the British withdrawal from India is implemented, Indians must learn to defend themselves.

### Reviving Zhabei;

The First Step Should Be Removing the Barbed Wire

It has been decided to cooperate with all parties to remove it in the short term to meet the public's expectations.

### Proposal to Reduce Entertainment Tax;

Finance Bureau Requests Delay in Passage

[Our Reporter] Regarding the entertainment tax, the Legislative Yuan has passed a case stipulating that provinces and cities should collect 25 percent, but it can only be implemented after approval by the Supreme National Defense Council. The municipal financial authorities, because the entertainment tax has always been a major source of tax revenue, and at a time when revenues and expenditures are not balanced, once the entertainment tax is reduced from 50 percent to 25 percent, the municipal treasury will be even more strained. Therefore, the Finance Bureau has telegraphed the Supreme National Defense Council, requesting a delay in passage to maintain municipal administration.

### The Dayu Steamer Completes Repairs in March;

Sea Trial;

Maiden Voyage to Hankou Tomorrow Night

[Our Reporter] The Dada Steamboat Company was founded in the 31st year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. For decades, it has been struggling to operate. Before the war, it already had a considerable fleet, including five Yangtze River vessels of more than 1,000 tons, and more than a dozen barges and small boats of several hundred tons. However, when the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, some were requisitioned by the government and sunk, while others were looted and occupied by the enemy. Those that went upstream devoted themselves to serving the transportation work in the rear; however, they were successively destroyed by enemy aircraft. Only remnants remained, moored between desolate beaches and shallow waters. The impact was indescribable. After the victory, the company, in view of the importance of aviation, discussed with the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to resume navigation to Nantong and other ports with the small ships it received. It also joined with Datong Shipping Company to form a joint venture to handle business. In May of last year, it was approved by the Ministry of Communications to obtain a loan of 76 million yuan to repair the damaged Dada steamboats and sail the Shanghai-Hankou line. It then salvaged the Dayu and Daqing steamboats, which had capsized in Badong and Qingtan, and brought them into the shipyard for repair. Now, after three months of work and a cost of 1 billion yuan, the repairs to the Dayu steamer have been completed. The company specially invited people from all walks of life to visit and test sail it yesterday afternoon, traveling to the river surface near Gaoqiao and returning. It arrived in Shanghai at 4:45 PM. The ship has joined the Shanghai-Hankou line and is scheduled to depart for Hankou on the night of the 26th. The Dayu steamer was originally the Daji steamer, which was rebuilt in 1931. The ship is 216 feet long and 36 feet wide, with a cabin depth of 12.3 feet. The total tonnage is 1,445.331 tons, and the registered tonnage is 864.45. The speed is 11 knots per hour. The economy class can accommodate 905 passengers. The first, second, and third class cabins can accommodate 170 people.

### Zizhong Steamer Joins the Northern Route

Yesterday Hosted Family Members of the Late General Zhang

In order to commemorate the martyrs of the War of Resistance, the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company named the new 3,500-ton ocean-going vessel purchased from Canada the "Zizhong" after General Zhang Zizhong, who died in the War of Resistance, and will use it to run the northern route. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company specially invited General Zhang's family members and relatives and friends in Shanghai to visit the ship at 9:00 AM this morning. It is reported that General Zhang's younger brother, Ziming, will present the ship's captain with a portrait of General Zhang in military uniform and will also present a poem by General Feng Wangxiang and a majestic and solemn choral piece "General Zhang Zizhong," composed by Wu Bochao, as the ship's song.

Suggestion to Restore Yu Qiaqing Road

At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, a memorial service was held at the Siming Cemetery. Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Zhengting, Yan Huiqing, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, and more than 20 others served as the presidium. After paying respects and condolences, Wang Xiaolai first reported on the life of Mr. Yu, followed by speeches from Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan, who praised Mr. Yu's spirit of diligence, frugality, and service to society. Mr. Wang Xiaolai suggested on the spot that Xizang Road be restored to Yu Qiaqing Road. Mayor Wu immediately replied that it would be sent to the Municipal Senate for a decision after it was passed by the Municipal Administration Meeting. Wei Bozhen, the managing director of the Ningbo Natives Association, reported that Mr. Yu had also wished to establish Siming University, Siming Middle School, Qiaqing Hospital, and a fisheries school, but these undertakings had not been completed. He hoped that everyone would work hard to carry on his legacy. The students of the Siming Volunteer Primary School then sang a dirge, and the family thanked the attendees. Finally, the posthumous title "Diligent and Accomplished" was announced, and the ceremony ended.

### Interest Income Tax Issue;

Municipal Chamber of Commerce Writes to the Direct Tax Bureau;

Requesting Application of Self-Assessment Method

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on the Shanghai Printing Industry Association's report that its member, Huafeng Printing and Typecasting Factory, had previously borrowed money from financial institutions other than Rongwai, and that it was unable to withhold the interest income tax, sent a letter to the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance requesting the application of the self-assessment method. The following is an excerpt from the letter: "To the esteemed Director, according to a letter from the Shanghai Printing Industry Association, a letter from Huafeng Printing and Typecasting Factory states: 'Our factory has been engaged in the cultural industry for more than 30 years. It suffered heavy losses during the War of Resistance. After the victory, in order to revive part of the business, we had to resort to high-interest loans. Since February and March of this year, the burden has become heavier and heavier, and business has declined. We cannot bear the exploitation of high-interest loans. Therefore, the part of the business that had been restarted was dissolved. Yesterday, officials from the Direct Tax Bureau came to our factory and instructed us to declare the income tax on deposit interest. They said that the collection of this tax began on January 1st of this year. Regardless of whether it is a deposit or a loan, all interest-related transactions must be withheld.' After hearing this, we were greatly alarmed, because we had no knowledge of this law beforehand, so we did not withhold any taxes. However, even if we knew about this and wanted to deduct it, it would be difficult to borrow money, unless the borrower paid it on our behalf. If that is the case, in addition to bearing high interest, we would have to pay another loan tax, which would be unbearable for the borrower (excerpt omitted).' After investigation, it was found that if industrial and commercial enterprises borrow money from institutions other than banks, such as paying interest to the lenders instead of withholding deposit interest income tax, borrowers will have difficulties. Lenders may take advantage of this situation to extort and coerce, so that named on our behalf, the actual need of pay borrowers, the original said the so-called "excluding negative high profits, but also another to pay a loan tax," according to the current situation, is the truth, it is inevitable that business will be more difficult. Article 23 of the Income Tax Law stipulates: 'The income of the third category shall be reported by the withholders or self-payers of income tax to the competent collection agency in accordance with the statutory format within 15 days after each payment or receipt of interest.' It is also the deposit Interest Tax, originally scheduled to have two kinds of means witholding as well as self assessment, according to letter before, the so-called collection difficulty. We fear that is not only the situation of Hua Feng Print Company; therefore, we ask your office for the following clarification, all those with the above situation, the self assessment shall be applied for interest Tax in general, exempted for payment, so as to reduce the difficulty of borrowers, as a little less to burden for the industrial and business."

### From American Goods Stalls to United Shopping Centers - Though Small, It Has All the Organs - Weak Purchasing Power Affects Sluggish Business

(Special Report from This Newspaper) "American Goods Stalls" and "United Shopping Centers." Different in name, but essentially the same. Because the constituents of the shopping centers are the stall vendors who were shut down. They have merely developed from "fighting alone" to "collective cooperation." "United Shopping Centers" are indeed "children of the times." Their emergence is due to: (1) Unstable times, economic depression in all industries, and many unemployed people, who have no choice but to take the easiest way to make a living. (2) Rampant smuggling in this city, with a large amount of surplus materials sold by the U.S. military, and the general public's extreme trust in "American-style equipment." Thus, in order to promote these American goods, "stalls" and "shopping centers" came into being. Regardless of their organization and form, they can achieve the same goal. (3) Stagnant industry and commerce, coupled with extremely high wages and living expenses. At this moment, small capital simply does not dare to open a shop. Forcibly opening one is a slow form of suicide. Rather than doing so, it is better to rent a "32-inch" glass tabletop in a "United Shopping Center," acting as both boss and clerk, with the ability to attack and defend, which is more stable and secure. This is the historical background for the emergence of "United Shopping Centers." At the same time, this situation is like a mirror, reflecting the distorted development of our economy and the crisis of the entire society.

The Rapid Rise of Numerous Markets

"United Shopping Centers" have developed very rapidly. They emerged after the city government's strict crackdown on stalls in early September. However, in a short time, there are already more than thirty United Shopping Centers in Shanghai today. Yesterday, this reporter passed by Zhongzheng East Road, entered a "United Shopping Center," and chatted with a shop assistant for a few minutes. He frankly said: He used to be a stall vendor, now he is a member of a United Shopping Center. The origin of the shopping center's organization is as follows: After the American goods stalls were shut down, people with business acumen saw the inevitability of shopping centers. So, an "initiator" used a large sum of money to take over a bar and turn it into today's site. All the stall vendors who came to operate paid a transfer fee of 850,000 yuan per person, and a monthly rent of 60,000 yuan, to rent a 32-inch glass tabletop area. However, the tabletop had to be provided by themselves. The lease term is set for three years, but they hope to have priority in renewing the lease in the future, so as not to be evicted when the lease expires. They are now preparing to negotiate with the "General Manager's Office." This shopping center was successfully organized by 109 stall vendor units. The variety of goods is extensive. Clothing includes American-style coats, raincoats, sweaters, wool vests, military blankets, hats, etc. There are even more varieties of food, from packaged foods, biscuits, coffee, cocoa, various candies...everything is available. Daily necessities such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, and cosmetics are also available. "Though small, it has all the organs," it is simply a miniature of a large department store. At the same time, our country has started its century with commerce. President Roosevelt said it well: "Commerce is the lifeblood of a free society." They have a unique understanding of making goods beautiful and pleasing to the eye, which is further enhanced by the milky white lighting. Moreover, the prices are indeed cheaper than in department stores. No wonder ordinary citizens with weak purchasing power flock to become customers. However, things are valued when they are scarce. Now, United Shopping Centers are opening too quickly and too many, which has affected business. A person selling medicines told me: Business is very bad. Sometimes he has to run around and sell unsold medicines to other businesses, earning 20,000 yuan per day to maintain a basic living.

The Only Strong Opponent of Big Companies

I remember that the city government decided to shut down American goods stalls on September 1 mainly for two reasons: First, they provided an outlet for smuggled goods and stolen goods from the docks. At that time, Mayor Wu said: "Items stolen from dock warehouses are sold on Xikou Road stalls within three days." Second, "The range of goods on each stall is very wide, and some have capital of up to tens of millions of yuan. Although the scale is no different from stores, they evade tax obligations, which has a considerable impact on legitimate businesses." After the exchange rate adjustment, the city government required companies not to raise prices, and the companies repeatedly demanded the crackdown on stalls. So the stalls were shut down, and the threat to big companies was eliminated. But in a short time, these stalls have reappeared in the form of "United Shopping Centers," becoming a headache again. Why are large department stores afraid of these small, makeshift shopping centers? The answer is easy to obtain. First, the latter has lower expenses and lighter costs. Their clerks are the bosses themselves, or the boss's family members. With lighter costs, the selling price can be lower. On the other hand, in large companies, the salaries of hundreds of employees must be included in the expenses. Without considerable profits, they cannot be maintained. The second point needs to be analyzed from the perspective of the customer's psychology. In shopping centers, they welcome you to look at the goods and patiently accompany you with a smile until you buy them. If you don't buy them, it doesn't matter to them, because their second-hand American military surplus materials are not appreciated by respectable people, and stall vendors have some inferiority complex. But in large companies, it is embarrassing to look at the goods and not buy them, and the attitude and appearance of company employees are far from the standards required by American business psychology. The main reason is that the value of currency has fallen, and the purchasing power of citizens is weak. American goods shopping centers have cheap goods, which easily attract customers.

Now, the city government has paid great attention to "United Shopping Centers." It believes that these "shopping centers are neither company organizations nor partnerships. Most of them are funded by the landlords to rent houses, add decorations, or even construct them with wooden frames and cloth awnings, resulting in too many stalls and narrow aisles. Once a fire occurs, it is unimaginable. And it is inevitable that tax-evading goods, stolen goods, will be sold here." The Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau have drafted the Shanghai Department Store Management Regulations, the principles of which have been approved at the municipal meeting and will be announced and implemented soon. Shopping centers that have already been established must apply for registration within a time limit. In the future, any new establishments must first be approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. Shopping centers must pay taxes in accordance with the law, otherwise they will be suspended. Unauthorized construction of shopping centers without a building permit will also be included in the crackdown. The sale of goods that violate health regulations and the sale of substandard medicines are prohibited. If private goods are found in any shopping center, it will be immediately suspended. At the same time, the shopping center's account books should be available for inspection at any time. Therefore, American goods shopping centers will be strictly managed in the future. Existing ones may be closed, and the addition of new ones is out of the question. These measures may even be a prelude to a crackdown!

### American Goods Flood the Market - Inexhaustible! Inexhaustible!

Analyzing the constituent members of American goods shopping centers, there are indeed a few people with financial resources, but most are poor people who cannot find employment. From American goods stalls to American goods shopping centers, it is all to maintain a livelihood. They have no power to smuggle. Smugglers are powerful people. Their goods are purchased in bulk from foreign firms or bought second-hand. There are too many American goods in Shanghai now. Even if there are no more supplements in the future, they will not be sold out for a considerable period of time. A fair person will not be overly sympathetic to these small vendors selling smuggled American goods, but they acknowledge the fact that they are seeking a living. They will wholeheartedly support proper management, and believe that if these people cannot be transferred to useful occupations, management, reasonable and strict management is the only measure that can be adopted. The entire country and society are in a "transition period," and there are many distorted phenomena. American goods shopping centers are only one of them, and a very small one.

### Two Cases of Dock Theft Uncovered

[Report from This Newspaper] On the 14th, a British ship docked at the Yichang Wharf of Little Jardine on Pudong, loaded with steel plates, pigments, and other items. While unloading, dock workers Wang Ganlin and Yin Wanlong, taking advantage of their work, stole pigments and hoisted them onto Tan Dalong's sampan, which they had conspired in advance. They sailed to a secluded place to divide the spoils. The case was detected by the Tilanqiao Police Station, and the principal offender Wang Ganlin and accomplice Tan Dalong were arrested. Part of the stolen goods were also found in Yin Wanlong's home. However, the suspect was out on business at the time and was not caught.

Wu Minggao, a temporary worker at the Huishan Wharf, took advantage of the Customs' takeover of enemy property on the morning of the 22nd. When transporting military blankets from the Huishan Wharf to the Customs warehouse, he stole five military blankets and two pieces of canvas and placed them in a hidden place. After finishing work at 5 pm, he hoisted the stolen goods down from the rear wall of the warehouse and took a sampan to the Gongping Road Wharf to go ashore. At that time, his panicked expression was noticed by plainclothes police officers Guan Zhuting and Chen Yaguan from the Tilanqiao Police Station. They went forward to question him, but his answers were evasive. He was taken to the police station for interrogation, and he confessed the whole story. It is reported that the case has been sent to the judicial authorities for investigation.

### Shanghai's Relief Work

— Special Report from This Newspaper

The waning autumn light has been blown away by the howling northwest wind. Many homeless poor people, wrapped in tattered cotton wadding, shiver in the cold wind, and frozen corpses are about to be found on the streets. This is another angle of the lens in a big city. Who says Shanghai is still a paradise! "Compassion for the poor" is a fine virtue that has been passed down in our country for thousands of years. Winter relief is a timely term at present. The municipal government, under extremely difficult financial circumstances, has also established a Winter Relief Committee to handle the annual social relief work. This is good news for the poor in Shanghai. It is hoped that the work can be started as soon as possible, and the poor can receive relief one day sooner.

Shanghai is indeed a metropolis. Not only is the number of charitable organizations more than elsewhere, but the work done is also more successful. Originally, what is most needed for running charitable undertakings is money. If the wealthy merchants and businessmen in Shanghai slightly save a little on the expenses of cigarettes, alcohol, and entertainment, the amount will be very considerable, and the undertaking will be easy to run.

"It is difficult to open the gate of charity" was originally just a cliché, but now people who run charitable undertakings do have this feeling. With soaring prices, charitable organizations all feel economically strained. Although donations come in steadily, they cannot offset the pressure of high prices. The huge deficit on the books cannot be made up, and some undertakings have to be stopped. But seeing so many singing stages and dance halls, tea houses and restaurants, where money is spent lavishly without any hesitation, it is hoped that the rich people in Shanghai will save a little to save these poor and helpless compatriots.

### The Long-Standing Renji Hall

On Yunnan Road, near Edward Road, there is a tall, temple-style old building standing in the line of many shops. This is the Renji Shantang, an organization in Shanghai that has been running charitable undertakings for sixty-four years.

Renji Hall is now famous throughout Shanghai. The relief work it has been doing, such as providing medical care, medicine, infant care, widow relief, clothing, and rice, has been continuous and tireless for decades, and has indeed benefited many poor people. This ancient charitable organization, from the "Civilization Bureau" to the "Zhonghe Bureau" to the "Renji Hall," has experienced many difficulties over the past sixty years. However, the people in charge have upheld the spirit of "feeling hungry when others are hungry and feeling drowned when others are drowned," and have worked to provide the poor with matters of life and death. This is worthy of admiration.

Sixty-four years ago, a "Civilization Bureau" appeared near the Hongmiao Temple on Nanjing Road. It was the predecessor of the Renji Shantang. The social welfare undertakings undertaken by the Civilization Bureau mainly included cherishing and collecting waste paper, opening free schools, and promoting persuasive campaigns to the public. In addition, it also devoted itself to charitable undertakings such as caring for the poor and relieving widows. In general, it was worthy of the name "Civilization Bureau." At that time, charitable undertakings in Shanghai were still in a primitive state, relying on the kind words and deeds of individual philanthropists. There was no organization, let alone undertaking. However, the establishment of the Civilization Bureau gave Shanghai society a considerable stimulus.

After the establishment of the Civilization Bureau, its undertakings increased and its scope gradually expanded due to the actual needs of society. Soon it moved from Nanjing Road to Beihai Road and was renamed the Zhonghe Bureau. At this time, the Zhonghe Bureau not only received the gratitude of the general public, but also gained the trust of many philanthropists, and the amount of donations increased day by day. At this time, the charitable undertaking of providing medical care and medicine was started, which provided the greatest assistance to the poor at that time.

After receiving encouragement from all walks of life, the people in charge of the Zhonghe Bureau further enhanced their belief in serving the society and hoped to maintain this sacred work forever. Therefore, they purchased the land on Yunnan Road today as a permanent foundation, and at the same time expanded the scope of the undertaking. The name was changed from Zhonghe Bureau to Renji Hall. This was in the ninth year of the Guangxu reign. At that time, Mr. Shi Shanchang was in charge, and Taishou Jia Yu Gao Shi also made a lot of effort. It is worthy of commemoration that the government and the people joined forces to run charitable undertakings, and it will always be remembered as a good story.

When we stepped into this old building and saw those plaques, we could not help but feel nostalgic for the past. The horizontal plaque with the words "Renji Hall" inscribed by Yu Quyuan is still hanging there for people to admire.

Providing medical care and medicine is the main work of the Renji Hall. Every morning, it is crowded with people waiting for diagnosis and medicine. The north and south halls are the diagnosis rooms for each department, and next to them is the place to dispense medicine. Every doctor carefully asks about the symptoms, diagnoses the source of the disease, and prescribes prescriptions carefully. They patiently guide the patients like a慈母Teaching their children, without the airs of famous doctors, nor the stern faces seen in big hospitals. They are very worthy of the words "仁心仁术(Benevolent Heart and Skilled Hands)."

The medicine dispensary is like an ordinary Chinese medicine store. The clerks work carefully with agile movements. Thousands of doses of medicine are dispensed from here every day, and the burden of medicine costs is also a considerable amount, which is raised by their running around and soliciting donations. They have three goals: (1) Strive for genuine medicinal materials in the selection of medicinal materials, (2) Be careful in matching and preparing them, (3) Dispense medicines according to prescriptions, without omissions or errors. They are working hard according to these three goals.

### Annual Poor People's Shelters

These annual shelters are a timely scene for winter relief. The northwest wind has been getting stronger and stronger recently, and the poor people on the streets are threatened by the severe cold. The shelters are stepping up preparations.

Before the war, the Chaozhou Guild Hall near the South Railway Station was borrowed for shelters every year. The main hall and the two halls there, and the land temple on the left, could accommodate seven or eight hundred people. Bamboo sheds were built in the open space inside the walls, which could also accommodate more than two hundred people. A total of more than a thousand people can be accommodated, but when there are many people, they cannot be accommodated as much as possible. Sometimes, other public places have to be borrowed as branch offices.

The Miserable Smile of Clinging to Life

This courtyard, which covers more than ten acres, is surrounded by walls made of red bricks. It is the place where these thousand homeless poor people are settled to spend the icy and snowy winter life. Pushing open the heavy iron gate, there is a rectangular counter on the right, with a clerk sitting on it, writing non-stop. This is the poor people's registration office. A large group of鸠形鹄面(scrawny-looking), wearing ragged cotton wadding, are squeezed chest to back, black and thin, forming a long snake formation. They stand along the counter, each declaring his name, age, native place, occupation, etc. This completes the registration procedure, and from then on, their food and accommodation are borne by the shelter. Looking at their faces, a miserable smile of clinging to life faintly floats.

The two sides of the hall are paved with wooden boards and padded with golden straw. Only a path is left in the middle, which is the poor people's bedroom. When sleeping, two people share a cotton quilt. During the day, they squat on the board铺(platform bed) like clay Buddhas, talking about the sky and the earth, some are catching lice, some are reading novels, and some are sitting face to face playing chess. The sallow and thin children also play there innocently.

Two Congees and One Meal a Day

The poor people eat two congees and one meal a day. Sometimes it is changed to three meals of congee, and there are also some pickles or radishes to go with the meal. When eating, every twelve people form a class, and there is another monitor in charge of supervision. The monitor is selected from the poor people, because their character and education level are relatively high, so they are given the title of monitor. When disbanding, those who serve cautiously are selected for awards.

There are no sanitary facilities in the shelter, but they also pay attention to the health of the greedy people. After the poor people register and enter the shelter, they must first eradicate their heads and bathe, and change their clothes, and each person gets a newly made set of cotton clothes and trousers. It is usually stipulated to take a bath four times a month and get a haircut twice. If someone gets sick, they are sent to the ward, where another nurse monitor is responsible. The nurse monitor accompanies them to the Xin Puyu Hall or Shanghai Hospital for diagnosis and treatment at any time.

The shelter has a period of three or four months every year, and when the weather is warm, it is given funds to disband. The poor people who are living on the streets can spend the winter well, and the meaning is very good. But after all, it is temporary. After the shelter closes, how will these thousand disbanded poor people live? If they can be given a corresponding job when they are taken in to cultivate their skills for making a living in the future, it will be of some help to society.

### The Heaven of White-Haired Elderly

"Raise children to guard against old age, store grain to guard against famine." How pitiful are the solitary and helpless elderly. They cannot enjoy their twilight years in peace, nor do they have filial sons and obedient grandchildren to inquire after their well-being morning and evening. But seeing the elderly in the Old People's Home in the Nanshi area, many are carefree and laughing, seemingly unaware that old age and illness are the bitter experiences of life. In particular, the nuns provide meticulous service with loving smiles always on their faces. Whose family has such filial daughters and virtuous daughters-in-law in such a heartwarming scene!

The Old People's Home is located on Jichang Street, Wai Ma Lu, in the Nanshi area. Stepping through the crimson side door from the rugged city streets is like entering another world. More than 350 elderly people live here, including men and women, Chinese and foreigners. The oldest is in their eighties or nineties, and the youngest is sixty years old. It is said that there have been several over a hundred years old. Their silvery white hair accentuates their ruddy faces, making them appear very healthy. There is a vast garden where vitality can be seen in the tranquility. The elderly can spend their twilight years here, which is truly boundless happiness. Who wouldn't call it paradise on earth?

Elders' Clothing and Food - Obtained Through Donations

The elders' clothing and food all come from external donations. Due to financial difficulties, they have changed to two congees and one meal after the war. Downstairs, there are four large dining halls, which are very spacious. Each person has their own set of cutlery, stored separately in large drawers. Next to it is a very large kitchen, with a combination of Chinese and Western cooking equipment, sparkling clean pots, and iron carts for transporting food. It is just like a kitchen in a large restaurant. Two or three nuns regularly solicit donations from the outside world. Vegetable markets, large restaurants, and general stores are the main places where they arrange for food. Cartons of biscuits, whole chickens and ducks, canned food from foreign merchants' food shops, as well as fish, meat, and vegetables, are all donated by philanthropists. After cooking, the aroma is overflowing. The elderly eat both meat and vegetables every day, and they are truly blessed with good food.

The elderly's clothes are also inexpensive goods donated by various sectors. After being disinfected and modified, they are distributed to them to wear. There are also occasional pieces of fabric donated by silk shops or clothing stores. After careful mending by the nuns, they are pieced together to form colorful brocade clothes and quilts, which are both beautiful and generous. In various parts of Lingnan, the "Hundred Harmony Quilt," which is imbued with the meaning of blessings, is popular and is considered the most grand gift in weddings. The brocade clothes and quilts made by the nuns with great effort also contain the meaning of blessings, which can certainly win the hearts of the elderly.

Twenty-Five Bedrooms

On the second and third floors, there are a total of twenty-five bedrooms, each housing fourteen people. The single small iron beds are covered with clean sheets and matched with colorful brocade quilts. Those who don't know would think it's the inner chamber of the owner. There is also a small table next to the bed, where personal items are placed.

The elders live a very regular life. They get up early in the morning, take walks, and play games. When their physical strength is particularly good in the afternoon, they help with laundry or sweeping the house. There are also special spinning wheels for the elderly women to pass the time. Their work is purely for leisure and does not seek any work results, but most of them are proud to be able to work more. After dinner, if they still feel that the time is too early, they can join three or five old companions in the relaxation room to chat and laugh casually, recalling old events, which gives them a sense of rejuvenation.

Nuns Take Turns to Care

In the Old People's Home, there is a perfect sickroom set up for the elderly who are sick. The nuns take turns caring for them day and night. Their diet, living, and sleeping are all supported by them. Among them, there is an old woman in her seventies lying on the sickbed. Another trainee nun who graduated from Xu Hui Girls' High School and entered the hospital is kneeling in front of the bed to feed her. There are even more nuns taking care of her, making people recall the scene on the screen of serving the Empress Dowager. Many elderly people with slightly weaker physical strength are also supported by the nuns to bathe. Those who are deaf, blind, lame, or disabled need even more patient care. They also specially made many patient cars, which are pushed by the nuns in the garden, allowing them to roam and enjoy themselves.

The Old People's Home has a history of more than 100 years in Europe. In China, "respecting the elderly" is also an ancient tradition. However, in Shanghai, this Old People's Home is the only place of peaceful residence for the poor and helpless elderly. The nuns, who are determined to uphold chastity, recite scriptures and cultivate the Tao, and do not ask about world affairs, wholeheartedly serve the elderly. Each of them serves the elderly with a welcoming smile, as if serving their own loving parents. The more they work, the happier they feel, and the more joyful they are for the achievements of their own cause. This may be due to the fullness of the Holy Spirit.

### "Concentration Camp" for Abandoned Infants - Renji Infant Home, the "Social Parents"

In Shanghai, it is unknown how many babies are abandoned every day. Most of them are abandoned by their parents because they are poor or have too many children and cannot afford to raise them. There are also many illegitimate children who are under the slander of society and the sanctions of etiquette. Parents have to give up responsibility. Who will raise this group of abandoned babies? Renji Infant Home has taken on the responsibility of these "social parents."

Renji Infant Home was originally one of the undertakings of Renji Shantang (Charity Hall). In the fourteenth year of Guangxu, Renji Hall used the remaining rooms in the hall to set up a "Baby Retention Bureau," specializing in raising abandoned babies, and specially hiring wet nurses to raise them, in order to fulfill the good virtues of God. However, due to the location and funding, everything was simple and crude. As the handling lasted for a long time, the reputation increased, and there were more and more sympathizers in the society. The funding was slightly sufficient, so the scale was slightly prepared, and the name was officially changed to Renji Infant Home. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, various affairs and gentry raised funds to purchase houses on Paoma Road to raise abandoned babies, which was considered to be on the right track. This Shanghai's only concentration camp for abandoned infants, separated by the vast racecourse, faces the International Hotel from afar, which is a very strong contrast.

Although Renji Infant Home is just a few old houses, seeing the five characters "Renji Infant Home" on the wall seems to emit the light of "human mutual assistance." As soon as you enter the gate, you can hear the cries of many newborns, whether lamenting the turbidity of the world or resenting the cruelty of their parents!

Workers' Nutrition

The infants housed in Renji Infant Home are raised with natural or artificial nutrients. The artificial nutrition department occupies two rooms, with more than 20 small iron beds arranged. On each bed lies a lovely baby. The babies' food is mainly milk powder and milk cakes. Sometimes, they also get a little fresh milk donated from the outside world, which is barely enough for nutrition. Nurses take shifts day and night to take care of them. Feeding and bathing have a set time, and the weight and temperature are measured once a day and recorded separately for doctors to check.

Natural Nutrition

The natural nutrition department is in three consecutive rooms on the east side, with forty or fifty small rattan hammocks arranged. A dozen wet nurses are hired to take on the work of raising them. Each person is assigned two or three babies. If there are too many babies, they will eat some milk powder, milk cake and other substitutes to make up for the lack of breast milk. There is also a female administrator who presides over the attendance and departure of the wet nurses.

They also pay attention to the health of the babies. All babies received are immediately inspected and diagnosed. The results of the examination are filled into the baby collection book separately. Western and Chinese doctors are hired on weekdays to treat sick babies in the hall. It is said that many poor parents do not have the heart to abandon them until they are terminally ill, so they often die before they can be treated. However, for abandoned babies, as long as there is still a breath, they will do everything possible to treat them. They really treat other people's children as their own.

Adoption Procedures

The babies raised in Renji Infant Home are allowed to be adopted by people who have no children. The procedure for adoption is to first fill out an application for adoption. After the hall has reviewed it, a blank guarantee is issued. The adopter and guarantor fill it out and send it to the hall. Then, the hall sends someone to investigate and confirms that they are of good background, have a proper occupation, and can afford the cost of raising the baby. After being notified by the hall, they can go to adopt the baby. They also send people to investigate the adopted babies at any time. If they are not satisfied, they will either issue a warning or take the baby back. However, at present, prices are high, and the economic situation is difficult. The number of people who are unable to raise their children and abandon them is increasing day by day, and the number of people who are able to adopt them is also decreasing day by day. Where can the Infant Home get thousands of rooms to accommodate them?

### A Brief History of Pushan Villa

Pushan Villa is the largest coffin distribution organization in Shanghai. Whenever we see a truck painted with a blue cross driving on the road, we will think of the corpses and frozen bones on the street, which can also be buried in peace. They will not be exposed on the street, which really gives the deceased infinite comfort and obscures many phenomena of poverty in the prosperous city.

Pushan Villa was founded by philanthropist Wang Junsheng in the second year of the Republic of China, and has a history of 33 years to date. That winter, there were so many corpses on the street that it touched Wang's compassionate heart. He took out his own money to buy a piece of wasteland in Zhabei, specializing in distributing coffins and burying the deceased on the road. This is the origin of Pushan Villa.

Wang's

Over the years, his enthusiastic work has won the sympathy of the society, but Wang's own strength is not enough. Therefore, a board of directors was soon organized, and leaders from all walks of life were appealed to help. Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, and others were hired as directors, which greatly helped the work, and the scope of the business gradually expanded. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, a general hospital was established on Xinmin Road, Zhabei, specializing in providing free childbirth for poor women, and in the summer, it also provided medical treatment for epidemic diseases. At the same time, Pushan Yixiao (Free School) was established near Pushan Villa to educate poor and out-of-school children. This is a more proactive job.

The main business of Pushan Villa is the work of collecting corpses and burying them. Therefore, more than 800 acres of land are leased in Dalian as a free cemetery. A part of this vast land is also designated as Pushan Cemetery, which is established for many people who have some assets but no land to bury them. After the Anti-Japanese War, the land in Dalian was requisitioned by the enemy to build an airfield. Therefore, they tried to change to Hongqiao in western Shanghai and leased more than 300 acres of farmland from the people. Later, because the coffins were full there, there was no gap. They also set up an open space in Qingpu Long, and continued to bury them.

The Battle of August 13th

Pushan Zihui made its best efforts and left a glorious trace in the history of the Songhu Anti-Japanese War. At that time, the service personnel of Pushan Villa drove trucks to rescue the wounded soldiers in the rain of bullets, and to bury the heroes and compatriots who died in the war. At that time, an empty truck always returned fully loaded. The highest record was more than 70,000 corpses collected in one day. The intensity of the work can be imagined. Unfortunately, Pushan Hospital and Pushan Yixiao were destroyed by the artillery fire. Finally, Pushan Villa also sacrificed in the Anti-Japanese War.

Although Pushan Villa has been hit, the people in charge are not discouraged. They are sticking to their original intentions and starting again. They borrowed a simple house opposite the Central Grand Theater on Six Ma Road to engage in their restoration work. However, the scope of business can only be reduced, and only the distribution of coffins and the burial of corpses on the road are handled. At that time, the enemy's gasoline was strictly restricted, so rubber collapse cars were used to patrol the streets every day.

Four Thin Boards

After the poor die, they have no way to collect their bodies, and Pushan Villa is responsible for it. When the corpses on the street are reported by nearby residents or notified by the police station, they will come to collect them immediately. The criminals executed by the garrison headquarters are also collected and managed by them. The corpses collected by Pushan Villa are all equipped with a thin-board coffin and transported to the suburbs for burial. In summer, it is divided into two times in the morning and afternoon, because the time interval is too long, it will rot. The corpses of children are cremated, but they are also given a coffin as usual. At present, a coffin made of four thin boards is worth about 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Therefore, the amount of monthly expenditure of Pushan Villa is considerable. The families of the coffin depositors or donors are sometimes willing to take out some money and donate it to the villa. In addition, it all depends on the directors to maintain it. At present, in addition to the Yizhong of Panlong Town, the land of Hongqiao has expired after the victory. In addition, Dunxin Road has a workshop specializing in making thin-board wooden coffins, Wuding Road has a place for stacking empty materials, and Paomating Road has a place for temporarily placing corpses and coffins. The office is located at No. 210 Beihai Road.

### Xin Pu Yu Tang - Diverse and All-Encompassing

Xin Pu Yu Tang is a large-scale charitable organization with an orphanage, infant home, old people's home, disability home, and a place for dispensing medicine and providing medical treatment. It is diverse and all-encompassing. It can be said to be the culmination of charitable undertakings. Xin Pu Yu Tang was founded by Mr. Lu Bohong and has a history of more than 30 years. Over the years, it has housed no less than 100,000 elderly, weak, disabled, orphans, and widows. Look at this vast area of 120 acres on the side of Guohuo Road in the Nanshi area. More than 20 Western-style buildings are hidden in the lush trees. The tranquil and elegant environment fully demonstrates the solemn and compassionate spirit of religion. It is simply not like a charitable organization, but a new society, a "Shangri-La" on earth!

The infant department houses fifty or sixty infants aged two or three, who are cared for by an Italian nun. Small beds are arranged inside, and there are small gauze nets on them. There are also many light blue strollers placed in the corridor. The children's apple-like faces often show innocence and vitality. Especially when they see the nun coming, the loving greetings, the warm smiles, and the whole courtyard are filled with love. It can really be said that these many children are all the dear children of this nun.

Sick Infant Department and Kindergarten

Children who are sick have a separate sick infant department, separated from normal children. It is said that when the infants first come, 80% of them are sick. After the nuns have carefully nursed them, they become strong and lively. They also raise a dozen dairy cows, all donated by enthusiastic people from the community. The infants have fresh and delicious milk to drink, and their nutrition is more adequate. The number of people who have been raised here and married off is not small. Behind the infant department is a Western-style building, which is the kindergarten department, housing seventy or eighty children, some of whom are sent from outside, and most of whom have grown up in the infant department. Children aged five or six have already begun to receive kindergarten education. They wear the same uniforms and rubber shoes, and sing and play there. When they are seven or eight years old, they are promoted to the next class. The boys go to Yixin Elementary School, and the girls live in another courtyard. There are spacious self-study rooms, clean dining rooms and bathrooms, and the upstairs is entirely bedrooms. They all wear blue shirts and black skirts and study at the affiliated voluntary school. Among them, there is a girl named Xuezhen, who was the only survivor of the more than 300 orphans who were killed when the National Army withdrew to the west in the 26th year of the Republic of China. When the nun talked about the story of rescuing orphans at the iron gate, Xuezhen's small eyes flickered with tears.

### The Home of the Older Sisters

Another two-story Western-style building is the home of the older sisters. They were originally raised by the nuns in swaddling clothes. After so many years and so much effort, they are now all in their twenties, and they are older girls waiting to be married. After they finish elementary school, they are taught some needlework and cooking and other housework. Marriage is a major event in life, and the older sisters' marriages are very important. After being introduced to each other, they consider the other party's occupation and life. After both parties are satisfied, they choose a date to get married. As a rule, the married girls return to the hall to visit their relatives once a year, sometimes accompanied by their husbands and children. The children call the nuns grandmothers, and the nuns also treat them as their own daughters and sons-in-law, kindly telling them about their families.

Disability Home and Old People's Home

The disability home houses forty or fifty disabled people: blind people, deaf people, dumb people, lame people, idiots, etc. There are all kinds of disabled people. There is one person whose head is supported by a bookstand. It is said that otherwise it would hang upside down on his shoulders. There is also a young man of seventeen or eighteen whose legs have been taken away by someone. When you talk to them about their lives, they choke up and cannot go on, and tears keep streaming down.

The old people's home houses sixty or seventy old people over the age of fifty or sixty, most of whom are from poor backgrounds, but there are also one or two "outdated" old masters and ladies. Among them, there is an old lady Zeng who was the wife of a Daotai (provincial governor) in the former Qing Dynasty. She used to go to various places with her husband and can still speak various local dialects. Another old man from Hangzhou, surnamed Zhou, eloquently recounted his past life of war, and his family was destroyed by the war, which led him to fall to this point, and he could not help but feel sad.

Xin Pu Yu Tang also runs a very perfect hospital with more than a dozen bungalows, housing more than 100 sick infants and children. Many of them have incurable diseases. Knowing that they cannot be saved, the nuns always take care of them with all their heart as long as there is still a breath. The adult wards are divided into male and female sections, and the equipment is even more perfect. The outpatient department dispenses medicine and provides medical treatment, becoming a gathering place for patients in the Nanshi area, and it is even more lively in summer.

Run a Free School

In addition, they also run a free school to educate general poor children. There is a large kitchen that supplies meals for more than 1,000 people. They raise pigs, chickens, grow vegetables, and raise rabbits themselves to save expenses. It is indeed the largest charitable organization in the city. They raise orphans from swaddling clothes to adulthood, and then teach them the knowledge and skills to make a living. They choose spouses for the girls and marry them off, fulfilling the responsibility of being parents on their behalf. For the elderly and disabled, they serve them until they die, and also shoulder the responsibility of being sons and daughters. Xin Pu Yu Tang's business combines the work of parents and children. Under the enlightenment of Catholic doctrine, they strive to make the cause shine even more brilliantly, and the spirit of religion is great enough.

### Reader Consultation - Legal Questions

(1) Housing Dispute

Hu Liren respectfully asks: A has rented the entire building from B for many years and has always been at peace. At the end of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, A left Shanghai and went elsewhere, locking the house. Now B wants to unconditionally take back the house, but A is unwilling to move. Please ask: (1) A and B have not signed a lease. Can A refuse to move by arguing that it is an indefinite lease? (2) Is it legal for B to take back the house if it is indeed needed urgently? (3) Will A's refusal to move constitute a crime of forcible occupation? (4) If B directly invites someone to open the lock and occupy the house, is it an act of encroachment? (5) Is it legal for A to ask B for relocation expenses in order to resolve the matter?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui's Answer] (1) Yes; (2) There must be a need to take back the house for one's own use and conclusive proof; (3) It is a civil matter, not a criminal matter; (4) There is a suspicion of obstructing freedom; (5) This is not a legal issue.

(2) A Lackey of the Tiger

Zhang Zhengheng asks: My relative, Mr. Chen, is of upright character. In the 24th year of the Republic of China, his cousin extorted money from him but failed, and held a grudge in his heart. In October of the 26th year, the Japanese invaders captured Wuxi, and A organized a "Welcome the Imperial Army Association," forcibly donating money to the villagers and using the power of the enemy puppets to coerce Chen in various ways, and gathered people to destroy Chen's house. Chen was afraid of the lewd power at the time and did not dare to resist. Last year, the Japanese invaders surrendered, and Chen intends to recover the losses from A, but A denies it. Although the negotiations have been resolved several times, he only admitted his guilt with incense and candles. Now there are several legal questions, please give an answer. (1) What crime did A commit for forcibly donating money to the enemy? Can he use the excuse of protecting the village to escape punishment? (2) Is it possible to recover losses from him and punish him for advocating chaos for destroying other people's property and advocating that killing people in times of chaos is not a problem? (3) Is the evidence of A's crimes signed by eyewitnesses legally valid?

[Lawyer Zhu Yapu's Answer] (1) There is a suspicion of aiding the enemy; (2) There is a suspicion of destruction, but pay attention that you must have suffered damage before you can claim compensation; (3) Valid.

### The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Industry Union Holds a Meeting - Factories Distributing Cotton Yarn Propose - Revising Cotton Yarn Prices - Distribution Methods to be Notified by the Distribution Committee

[Reported by this newspaper] The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Industry Union held a general meeting of members from factories distributing cotton yarn at 3 pm yesterday. Representatives from various factories attended, numbering around twenty to thirty people. The meeting was chaired by Chairman Wang Qiyu. Mr. Wang reported three points regarding the cotton yarn distribution method: (1) In addition to the yarn spindles used by each factory for weaving, the remainder will be distributed. (2) The remaining production volume of each factory, in addition to being allocated for the re-processed product industry and transported to South China for sale, will be re-distributed. (3) For the remainder of the second point, A. half will be transported to other ports by each factory, but must be transported after applying for approval from the Textile Management Committee. B. The remaining half will be sold by each factory. The distribution targets are limited to the business accounts of members of the Yarn Business Association or other members. If the re-processed product industry factories do not have enough cotton yarn allocated, it will be allocated appropriately. Furthermore, 1,500 pieces will be allocated from the remainder to retailers. The points reported by Mr. Wang were submitted to the meeting for discussion. Two points were then resolved: (1) The method of approving the points reported by the chairman shall be handed over to the distribution committee, and the factories shall be notified to handle them. (2) Market conditions in various industries are now changing. Taking raw cotton in this month as an example, the price has increased. The Price Negotiation Committee should re-negotiate the price based on the actual situation.

### Preventing Smuggling and Curbing Rising Winds - Customs Strictly Prohibits Gold Exports - Confiscation After Seizure and Severe Punishment

The price of gold has skyrocketed in recent days, and speculators have pushed up the price. It is also reported that merchants from other ports are coming to Shanghai to search for purchases in an attempt to profit. It is learned that in order to suppress the price of gold, the authorities have decided to strengthen the crackdown on gold exports. The Customs and all relevant agencies have decided to strictly prohibit the export of gold bars, gold business, gold nuggets, gold coins, ore gold, gold sand, and all gold products (referring to those with the shape of ornaments or utensils made entirely or partially of gold and silver) in accordance with the "Measures to Prevent Smuggling and Carrying Gold and Silver for Export" previously promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. Those who must transport for export due to legitimate reasons shall first apply to the Ministry of Finance for an export passport and report it with the certificate. Otherwise, after seizure, it will not only be confiscated and confiscated, but those who violate other laws and regulations due to smuggling shall be severely punished.

It is also learned that the government authorities believe that the rise in the price of gold is enough to stimulate the rise in other prices. At a time when various major commodities are making every effort to suppress prices, they will never allow the price of gold to skyrocket. The Central Bank controls a lot of gold. Recently, a large number of gold has been transported from home and abroad. It has decided to continue to sell a large amount of gold without restrictions in order to suppress the rising wind. The Central Bank will also strengthen the tightening of communications so that speculators will be unable to manipulate it. Relevant authorities will conduct a thorough investigation of those who speculate and manipulate gold. Those who have real accounts will be severely punished.

### Optimistic Outlook for People's Food Supply

The previously severe food problem in this city has seen its reserve stocks become extremely sufficient since the authorities actively dredged the source. Although other commodity prices have fluctuated greatly recently, rice prices have remained stable. According to the responsible person in charge of food, the national harvest this year is abundant, with the harvest in the Yangtze River basin averaging over 80%, which is unprecedented in the past 30 years. Currently, national grain prices have generally fallen, especially in Chongqing, where rice is only 16,000 yuan per dan. Rice prices in various parts of Zhejiang Province have also fallen to over 30,000 yuan, with the price of new rice as low as 25,000 yuan per shi. As for Taiwan Province, after negotiation with the authorities, Taiwanese rice will be shipped to Shanghai. It is reported that 50,000 tons are waiting for loading and transportation to Shanghai in Keelung. Therefore, the future of the people's food supply is optimistic. Moreover, in order to plan ahead, the authorities have already transported a large amount of rice to this city and stored it in various warehouses. When necessary, it can be released at any time to curb the rise in rice prices.

### Rescuing the Tobacco Industry Crisis: Four Banks Undertake Tobacco Leaf Mortgage Financing at 60% Collateral for a Term of Three Months

The Cigarette Industry Association of this city, etc., believing that the tobacco industry crisis is becoming increasingly serious, have submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for prompt relief, handling low-interest reconstruction loans for tobacco areas, and low-interest mortgage financing methods for state tobacco. The Ministry of Finance forwarded the request to the Joint Office of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China for approval. Since the tobacco leaf production and processing loans were already included in this year's agricultural loan amount, there was no need for separate approval. Regarding the tobacco leaf mortgage financing, the Farmers Bank of China has formulated five principles for various bank branches to undertake tobacco leaf mortgage financing, which have been revised and approved by the Loan Review Committee, namely: (1) Mortgage financing of tobacco leaves is limited to improved varieties that can be used as cigarette raw materials; (2) It shall be handled in concentrated locations in production and sales areas; (3) Each factory or tobacco merchant can apply to the bank branch for mortgage financing at 60% of the purchase price of tobacco leaves from various places; (4) The mortgage financing of tobacco leaves can be converted into a mortgage loan after arrival, with a term of three months, which cannot be extended. Mortgage financing by tobacco merchants cannot be transferred into mortgage financing; (5) Those who meet the above principles can be handled and reported by each bank branch as they are done, within a limit of 200 million yuan, and a special report should be submitted to the Joint Office of the Four Banks every week.

### Developing China's Silk Industry: Starting with Improving Silkworm Eggs: The China Sericulture Company is Ordered to Draft a Five-Year Plan

[Report from this newspaper] The administrative authorities plan to use huge funds to support China's silk industry, starting with the improvement of silkworm eggs, to silk reeling and silk weaving. The production equipment and technology at each stage will be completely modernized, and the quality and production costs of silk will be able to sell well overseas. The China Sericulture Company has now been ordered to draft a plan, hoping that after five years, the private silk industry will no longer need government assistance and will have sufficient strength to compete with other countries. The upcoming Silkworm Egg Improvement Committee is the starting point for this effort, with the aim of collecting opinions from all parties in order to formulate a practical improvement plan. As for the opinions of representatives from all parties, they can be roughly summarized as follows: (1) Organize silkworm egg loans, a portion of which will be used to reform equipment, such as building low-temperature rooms, establishing mulberry gardens dedicated to young silkworms, and increasing mulberry gardens in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Another part is production loans, hoping to have 7 billion yuan, lent in installments, to be returned after the sale of eggs. (2) Reduce local varieties to improve the quality of silk cocoons. Please ask the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to implement this work conscientiously. (3) Estimation of the number of improved silkworm eggs to be distributed next spring: 600,000 sheets in Jiangsu, 600,000 sheets in Zhejiang, and a total of 50,000 sheets in Anhui, Guangdong, Shandong, and other provinces, totaling 1.25 million sheets. It is estimated that Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Yunnan can produce 1.05 million sheets by themselves, so another 200,000 sheets need to be imported from Japan. Half of these 200,000 sheets will be distributed to Zhejiang, and half to Jiangsu, Anhui, Guangdong, and Shandong. (4) Free buying and selling of silkworm eggs next spring. In addition, silk industry representatives were even more indignant about the wartime losses of the silk industry due to the refusal to transport Japanese cocoons to China, and planned to establish a National Silkworm and Silk Industry Loss Investigation Committee during the Anti-Japanese War in the short term, to submit accurate statistical figures to the Central Wartime Compensation Committee, so as to demand compensation from Japan in the future.

### Shanghai Credit Cooperative Opens Today

Credit cooperatives are very common in European and American countries. Their business nature is entirely a civilian bank. In Shanghai, this type of organization is still a pioneering effort. The Shanghai Mortgage Credit Cooperative has been organized and is located at 251 Wusong Road. It is scheduled to open today. Its purpose is to facilitate the turnover of funds for all members. The business subjects are tentatively set as follows: (1) Accepting various deposits, (2) Handling small mortgage loans, (3) Handling mortgage loans for materials and warehouse receipts, (4) Handling acceptance of bills and discounting of bills, (5) Handling trust and warehousing business, (6) Investing in related cooperative businesses, (7) Acting as an agent for receiving and paying funds and entrusting various businesses.

### High Interest Rates and High Costs: The Silk Weaving Industry Faces a Serious Crisis: Loan Applications from Various Factories are Still Awaiting Approval from the Central Bank: We Have Missed the Opportunity in the Nanyang Market

The various conditions for the loan for the electric silk weaving industry have not yet been approved by the Central Bank. According to Cai Tingtao, the chairman of the industry association, the current working capital needed by each factory is quite large, about several hundred billion yuan. This amount is lent by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to the Central Bank for rediscounting. Each weaving machine can be loaned 3 million yuan, and each factory is limited to 500 million yuan. The issue of loan collateral is still under discussion. The bank originally stipulated that 70% of the collateral should be raw material rayon, but manufacturers believe that it is unreasonable to mortgage raw materials and still produce. Later, it was agreed that 50% should be raw materials and 50% should be finished products. In the future, finished products can be gradually replaced with raw materials for further production when necessary. This agreement is still awaiting approval from Mr. Lin Fengbao, the director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, after he returns to Shanghai. The rumor that it has been approved is not true. According to Cai, the electric silk weaving industry is currently facing a severe crisis due to the pressure of high-interest funds and sluggish sales. The domestic market is unable to develop due to the impact of transportation. It is hopeless to open up the foreign market due to cost reasons. China has no rayon production at all, so all raw materials rely on Japan. Japanese rayon is currently 500,000 yuan per dan. The China Trust Bureau obtains this rayon through barter, and the rayon allocated to manufacturers is 2.8 million yuan per dan (3.8 million on the black market in this city). Finished products made from such expensive raw materials are naturally difficult to compete with Japanese goods, so our country has missed the opportunity in the Nanyang market.

### Responsible Person of the Income Tax Bureau Talks About Commercial Report Precautions

Commercial Capital is Calculated in National Currency

Yesterday, the reporter visited the person in charge of the Income Tax Bureau to inquire about the precautions for commercial reports. According to the report: (1) Regarding the commercial report for the 34th year of the Republic (1945), if there are no account books as a basis, the bureau has a form for businesses to fill out. After filling it out, there should be no further objections to the income tax payable in the future. The completed form and written report should be sent to the bureau immediately for review. (2) Commercial reports for the 34th year of the Republic (1945) with account books as a basis need to include income, expenditure, surplus, or loss, budget statements, and other statistics. (3) Businesses that had two months of business operations in the 34th year of the Republic (1945) need to write and send in the commercial report for the 35th year of the Republic (1946) at the same time.

The reporter further inquired about the standard of commercial capital. According to the report: capital refers to the total amount of investment when the business started. If the funds are not legal currency, then this foreign currency needs to be converted into national currency according to the exchange rate at that time. If the headquarters of the business is in a foreign country, then the funds received by the domestic branch can also be used as capital. However, when the capital increases, the Income Tax Bureau will calculate the average amount of capital at the end of each month of that year.

### Flour Prices are Lower than the Price Ceiling: Flour Merchants are Unwilling to Collect Flour at the Price Ceiling: The Flour Industry Association Notifies Members to Return Flour Purchase Certificates

Flour prices are lower than the price ceiling. Some flour merchants in this city are unwilling to follow the regulations of the Flour Industry Association for distributing flour. Instead of collecting flour from the association at the price ceiling and selling it with the flour purchase certificate cards of the cake, steamed bun, sliced noodle, and dough product industry associations, they directly purchase flour from flour factories, but still sell it with certificates. The Flour Industry Association believes that this is a violation of the rules, resulting in a daily decrease in the amount distributed by the association. In the future, if flour prices change, the members who violate the regulations will be responsible for not being able to obtain a sufficient amount of distributed flour or being reprimanded by the authorities. Yesterday, the association notified its members that if they believe that the distribution of flour is unprofitable, the procedure is troublesome, and they are unwilling to continue, they can send a letter requesting suspension of the distribution and send all the received purchase certificates to the association for verification and investigation.

### Commercial Common Sense: The Difference Between Pigments and Dyes

Pigments and dyes are two completely different things. Not only are the commodity names different, but the properties and uses are also completely different. Chemical industry experts have already classified them in detail, but the general public still cannot completely distinguish between pigments and dyes, and even think that dyes are pigments. The Shanghai National Pigment and Sundries Industry Association has specially listed the differences between pigments and dyes for reference. They are listed separately as follows:

(A) Pigments

Vermilion, Cinnabar, Red Lead, White Lead, Gold Powder, Silver Powder, Litharge, Titanium Powder, Zinc Powder, Lithopone, Barium Sulfate, Barium Carbonate, Ink Ash, Charcoal, Pencil Lead Powder, Scarlet (Flower Red), Various Reds, Yellow, Yellow, Ochre, Azurite, Malachite (Buddha Head Green), Copper Filament, Malachite Green, Zinc Filament, Varnish Filament, Various Precipitated Pigments, Other Organic Pigments, Inorganic Raw Materials.

### Types and Systems of Occupational Insurance

— Bu Renlin

Water insurance, fire insurance, war risk insurance, theft insurance, these are all insurances aimed at protecting property damage, and are insurances on things.

Occupational insurance is an insurance on personnel affairs, which is an insurance to protect the remuneration obtained from any occupation; if the remuneration of the practitioner is stopped, it can obtain considerable compensation to reduce the pain in life during unemployment.

The scope of occupation is very broad. According to the different modes of service, it can be roughly divided into:

(1) Free professions, such as doctors, lawyers, accountants, etc.

(2) Self-employed businesses, using funds, spirit, and labor to directly engage in agriculture, industry, and commerce.

(3) Appointment and employment, those who obtain remuneration by using spirit and labor through appointment and employment.

Freelancers rely on technical ability to obtain remuneration. The prosperity and decline of their affairs and the amount of their income are not fixed and unchangeable. Then we need to provide assistance and compensation to them when their business is idle and their income is insufficient. This responsibility should be borne by occupational insurance.

However: The business conditions and income of freelancers vary from person to person, from place to place, and from time to time, and are different. For occupational insurance, the amount of insurance can be proposed by the insured himself, but under what circumstances should the insurer compensate for the damage of the insured, and the amount of compensation is paid according to the amount of insurance? Or is it paid according to the actual amount of damage? How will the actual damage be based on the facts? To make a reasonable judgment; these many problems are difficult to solve in organizing insurance on personnel matters.

For insurance on things, the insurer must bear the responsibility of compensation for the losses suffered by the insured property due to force majeure: however, the occurrence of force majeure events is accidental;

Occupational insurance is insurance on people and things. The change of occupational status is entirely due to human factors. The prosperity and decline of the occupation, the amount of income, can be manipulated by practitioners, but except for themselves, there is no way to predict the policies and means they will implement in the business in the future.

Due to the variability of personnel affairs, to organize occupational insurance, it is necessary to divide various types of insurance and set up various systems according to the different occupations, the disparity of status and environment, so as to meet the needs of each actual situation and the scope of damage borne by the insurer; and to enable the insured to obtain the necessary amount of compensation when receiving damage compensation, so that the insurer can also pay reasonable compensation under the principle of concentrating strength and sharing risks.

Self-employed businesses are similar in nature to free professions; however, self-employed businesses, in addition to technical ability, require a large amount of capital for business operations. His degree of harm, in addition to business decline and insufficient income, has a greater harm responsibility for capital losses.

Regarding the property part of self-employed businesses, we can use property insurance (water and fire insurance, etc.) to bear his damage responsibility, but when the business declines, business is suspended, and the self-employed business owner's income is stopped, occupational insurance should be used to compensate him.

Those who obtain remuneration by using spirit and labor through appointment and employment, the reasons for the cessation of income are automatic resignation, changing careers, and passive dismissal, layoffs, and the dissolution of the service agency itself.

Occupational insurance, the responsibility it bears for the employed, is to assist life after dismissal and reduce the pain of unemployment.

According to the above description, it can be known that occupational insurance, due to the different status of the insured, the responsibility it bears is complicated and simple, the procedures are difficult and convenient, and the investigation of damage also occurs because there is no basis and it is easier to investigate.

Occupational insurance, only by adapting to the circumstances, can insurance systems be set up according to their different objectives.

Occupational insurance systems can be cited:

(1) Liability insurance system

(2) Occupational savings system

Free professions and self-employed businesses have a wide scope and complex changes in business conditions. It is difficult to have a clear basis for damage compensation, so only the savings system can be used to enable practitioners to engage in occupational savings. When income decreases and compensation is needed, the insurer will not only pay the principal and interest, but also provide specially stipulated damage compensation.

Those who are appointed and employed can be divided into the following categories according to the different service industries:

(1) Military

(2) Political

(3) Academic

(4) Industrial and Commercial

(5) Agricultural

Military and political affairs are national affairs, and schools are mostly run by the government, so layoffs and dissolution are occasional, while resignation, changing careers, and being dismissed are common;

The industrial and commercial sectors can be divided into the following categories according to employers:

(1) State-owned enterprises

(2) Company organization

(3) Partnership organization

(4) Sole proprietorship

State-owned enterprises and corporate enterprises have strong organizations, so the resignation, changing careers, and dismissal of employees are common; layoffs and dissolutions are occasional; however, layoffs and dismissals are more likely to occur in partnership organizations and sole proprietorships.

The hired workers in the agricultural sector are mostly temporary in nature; long-term hired workers are very few, so they are not .

Those who bear insurance responsibilities measure the probability of damage occurring to the insured. If the probability is high, the risk borne is high, and the insurer should increase the insurance premium and stipulate the scope of compensation conditions; if the possibility of damage is small, then reduce the insurance premium or even relax the conditions.

Employment liability insurance stipulates insurance premiums based on the size of the risk; separates the causes of damage, whether it is common or occasional, and stipulates the percentage of compensation; as for the insurance period, follow the fire insurance system and use the year as a unit.

The above is only a brief description of what has been seen. As for occupational savings, liability insurance, how many systems should be divided? When the insured suffers damage, how should the investigation procedures be carried out? Obtain conclusive evidence; how to prevent impersonation and fraud? How should the insurance contract be concluded? And so on, these issues require insurance experts to observe the social occupation situation, in accordance with the law, and conduct detailed discussions and designs.

As for the task of promoting occupational insurance, organizing groups is not as good as the insurance occupation taking on this responsibility.

### Ministry of Education Carefully Studying the Issue of Opening Up Nationally Compiled Textbooks; The Seven United Office Has 100,000 Reams of Paper Stored, Awaiting Orders to Print

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] Regarding the issue of opening up nationally compiled textbooks for primary and secondary schools, the Ministry of Education is taking a cautious approach to research. During the war, the joint supply by seven publishing houses was originally a transitional policy. In order to respect public opinion and suggestions from civil organizations, the Ministry of Education approved the participation of four publishers, including Children's Publishing House, after the victory. It is now reconsidering the opening up issue. The Ministry of Education's spokesperson publicly expressed the following opinions: (1) There are not many types of nationally compiled textbooks. The subjects for primary schools are still complete, while only a small number of nationally compiled textbooks in humanities are available for middle schools. (2) Textbook shortages are a common phenomenon in recent years and are not limited to nationally compiled textbooks. Taking Nanjing as an example, the English, chemistry, and geography textbooks used by the affiliated middle school of Central University are not nationally compiled, and there is no supply either. (3) Opening up textbooks is a normal approach, but the method adopted for opening up still requires careful study and prudent decision-making. It is reported that adopting nationally compiled textbooks during the war was a transitional measure, and opening up should theoretically be implemented after the victory. However, because the current situation of materials, transportation, and order in various places has not fully returned to the pre-war state, if the opening up is not carried out in a planned manner, the editing and printing will be done independently, without assigned responsibility, which may lead to a more severe textbook shortage and no books to supply. Moreover, textbooks are related to the national education policy and should be adapted to the actual situation of the times. It is heard that the Ministry of Education will designate relevant departments and the National Institute for Compilation and Translation to jointly establish an organization responsible for research and management. How to open up with conditions is still under research, and it is still early to decide on the announcement date.

[Another message] Regarding the issue of how to open up textbooks, a person in the publishing industry said: It must be resolved by around December 5th at the latest, because there cannot be sufficient time for printing and transportation to be delayed. It is learned that the Shanghai Seven United Supply Office currently has 100,000 reams of white paper stored, waiting to be printed, but is still waiting to see before receiving a clear order from the Ministry of Education.

### Cheng Shizheng Scheduled to Fly to Taiwan

Civil Administration Briefs

### Civil Service Performance Evaluation Should be Strictly Implemented in Accordance with the Law; Municipal Government Complies with Orders and Instructs Subordinates to Take Note

The Municipal Government has received an order from the National Government stating that the year-end performance evaluation and regular assessment of civil servants should be given equal importance so that the judgments can be accurate and the rewards and punishments can be fair. Although there has been much progress in the handling of year-end performance evaluation and regular assessment by various agencies during the extraordinary period, the inertia of old habits has not fully played the due role. There are also cases of delays or negligence, which are not in line with the way to eliminate the turbid and purify, comprehensively check the names and verify the reality. Since the restoration, there are many political affairs to be undertaken. It is hoped that civil servants at all levels will be diligent and strive to carry forward the spirit of hardship and perseverance during the war to jointly govern. It is hoped that the chief officials of all agencies will rectify themselves and set an example of law-abiding, public service, and practical progress. Year-end performance evaluation and regular assessment of personnel should be strictly implemented in accordance with the law to eliminate the inferior and retain the good, and the rewards and punishments should be fair and appropriate, so as to maximize efficiency. After receiving the order, the Municipal Government has issued orders to its subordinates to comply.

### Personnel Changes in Various Districts

Chen Gengxiu, deputy district chief of the Fifth District (Taishan), previously requested to resign due to illness. The vacancy will be temporarily filled by Du Weiheng, pending the popular election of the district chief and deputy district chief, with the approval of the Municipal Government.

### A Scene from a Henan Farce: Fangcheng County Magistrate Privately Uses Military Grain Funds; Director of Land Administration Bureau Suspected of Receiving Funds on His Behalf; Kaifeng News on the 16th; Wang Shoumei, Our Correspondent in Bian

The Henan Disaster Relief Appeal Group, bearing the blood and tears of 30 million disaster victims in Henan Province, has been running around in Beijing and Shanghai for more than two months and has just returned. Representatives from various counties have flocked to the provincial capital for help like a tide. In the midst of the Provincial Assembly's calls for the government to cut staff and reduce administration in order to rescue the disaster victims of the entire province, a farce has been staged in the Henan officialdom. This farce is a great satire on Henan politics. At the same time, due to the serious accusations from the media and civil organizations, it is said that some important people and county magistrates who have not yet revealed their true colors have begun to be busy and preparing to "pack up" and quickly return the military grain funds that have been embezzled or swallowed to the people without leaving a trace.

### Zhao Zuo'an Plays the Lead Role; Fan Zuomin Plays a Supporting Role

In the performance of this farce, Zhao Zuo'an, the county magistrate of Fangcheng, plays the lead role, Fan Zuomin, the director of the Henan Provincial Land Administration Bureau, and Xue Binqing, the staff member of the Fangcheng County Grain Administration Section, play supporting roles. There is also one pitiful wronged person, namely Zhu Wenbin, the chief of the Fangcheng Grain Administration Section, who can be regarded as a supporting role of a supporting role. The plot is the private use of 129 million yuan of Fangcheng's military grain funds for illegal operations. The entire play is still being performed. It is not yet possible to determine how many acts and scenes it should be divided into. Now, only a systematic report is made on the origin and evolution of this case based on the information obtained by the reporter from five days and nights of non-stop investigation:

The Ministry of Food purchases military grain in Gu Province, not on a cash-on-delivery basis, and often delays it for a year and a half or three months or two months. No one knows when it will be sent to the province, no one knows when it will be sent to the county, no one knows when it will be sent to the townships, and no one knows when it will be sent to the people! The people think it is right to produce grain. Sending the price is considered a favor from the superiors. This favor is often a moon in the water and a flower in the mirror, which is desirable but unattainable. Even if it is sent to the Township Office, it is offset left and right, and after it is all offset, just tell the people, and the people will be very grateful. All crows in the world are generally black. For many years, this situation has been so common that it is not surprising. This social environment and political atmosphere are one of the reasons why Zhao Zuo'an muddied the waters. Secondly, Zhao Zuo'an's upper-level relations are very smooth, and he is very close to the so-called "Four King Kongs." The "Four King Kongs" in Henan do have the power to "turn the world upside down." Having such a hard and powerful backer has created a sense of fearlessness for him. This is another reason why Zhao Zuo'an dared to act recklessly. Based on the above two reasons, he probably had been thinking about "making a fortune" for a long time.

In early June of this year, the Ministry allocated a batch of military grain funds to the Henan Provincial Agricultural and Grain Administration. Among these military grain funds, there were 129 million yuan of Fangcheng's military grain funds for March to June of the thirty-fourth year. The Provincial Agricultural and Grain Administration immediately ordered Fangcheng County in the same month to prepare a document and send someone to the province to collect the funds. County Magistrate Zhao Zuo'an immediately sent Xue Binqing, a staff member of the County Grain Administration Section, to the province with an official document and seal to collect the funds. After Xue arrived in the province, the Provincial Agricultural and Grain Administration did not sign the check because the seal on the submitted document did not match. At that time, County Magistrate Zhao happened to come to the province to attend an administrative meeting and immediately went to the Agricultural and Grain Administration to negotiate and ask the person in charge to write down the inconsistencies in the procedures and return them to the county for correction. The person in charge of the Agricultural and Grain Administration immediately complied. After Zhao returned to the county, it happened that there was news of a change in the chief of the County Agricultural and Grain Administration Section. The original chief of the Agricultural and Grain Administration Section, Zhu Wenbin, was preparing to come to the province. Zhao Zuo'an gave the corrected document to Zhu Wenbin to take to the province to assist Xue Binqing in handling the fund collection procedures. At the same time, Zhao Zuo'an wrote a letter to Fan Zuomin, the director of the Provincial Land Administration Bureau (one of the "Four King Kongs"), saying that the fund collectors had something to report in person and requested an audience. The letter was taken to the province by Zhu Wenbin. After Zhu arrived in the province and handed the document to Xue Binqing, he sent the Zhao letter to Director Fan Zuomin. Fan agreed to handle it on his behalf. Zhu did not stay in the province for long and returned to the county. Since then, he has not seen Xue Binqing, and the military grain funds have also disappeared.

### Military Grain Funds Exceeding One Hundred Million: Waited and Waited, But Nothing Seen

According to a report by Sun Luzhan, Secretary of the County Council, the County Council Speaker Xiao stated: "On August 2nd, I met Xue Binqing in Bian. According to him, the military grain funds have all been handed over to Fan Zuomin, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, for civilian use." As a result, all sectors of the county were quietly waiting for this batch of 129 million yuan in military grain funds. However, they waited and waited, but nothing was seen. By early September, the County Council truly could no longer remain silent. It formally questioned County Magistrate Zhao through official channels, asking where the military grain funds had gone and requesting a response from County Magistrate Zhao. However, County Magistrate Zhao kept prevaricating and did not reply. With no other choice, various agencies dispatched representatives to the province to investigate. Sun Luzhan represented the County Council, Yuan Ziyu represented the Youth League, and Zhu Wenbin, the former Chief of the Grain Administration Section, totaling three people, left the county on September 7th to investigate in the province. At that time, various newspapers in Bian published news of the "Missing Military Grain Funds in Fangcheng." After detailed investigation, it was discovered that this large sum of money was issued a check by the Provincial Field Grain Division on July 18th, with the check number being 1237, 661985. Xue Binqing cashed it at the Central Bank on July 19th. When the representatives questioned Director Fan Zuomin, he stated that he had handled 110 million yuan, and the remaining 19 million yuan was taken to Luohe by Xue Binqing. After repeatedly urging Director Fan Zuomin to quickly hand over the original funds and remit them to the county, Director Fan Zuomin delayed on the grounds that the remittance route was blocked. Later, after more than ten days, on September 17th, 18th, and 24th, respectively, 80 million yuan was remitted to Xuchang, and 10 million yuan each was remitted to Xiangxian and Yexian. The representatives brought back 10 million yuan in cash. (The above investigation process can be seen in Sun Luzhan's telegram to County Magistrate Zhao and Sun's signed report to Speaker Xiao.) However, by this time, the case had already attracted the attention of many people in Shacheng.

In early October, County Council Speaker Xiao and Deng Xiang of Fangcheng County went to Kaifeng and formally filed a complaint with the relevant agencies. The newspapers in Shacheng also published this news in a prominent position every day. At the same time, it happened that Director Gu and Zhu Tong arrived in Bian. After reading the newspaper, he learned about the case and heard that General Gu had personally instructed Chairman Liu to thoroughly investigate and severely punish it. Chairman Liu was probably shocked at this time. He felt that his subordinates were deceiving him. He was very sad and very angry. At the same time, because of the exposure and accusations of the case in various newspapers, Chairman Liu was even more angry. In a fit of anger, he decided to dismiss Zhao Zuoan at the beginning of this month and escort him to the province for strict punishment according to law. At the same time, Xue Binqing, the main culprit in the case and the grain administration clerk of Fangcheng, and Zhu Wenbin, the former chief of the grain administration section who was involved in the case, were also detained and brought to the province for interrogation. Two days before Zhao Zuoan and others were escorted to the province, the Fangcheng County Association in Bian decided to raise three questions to Zhao Zuoan and drafted a notice with these questions, which was sent to the Bianyuan newspaper offices on October 5th for publication. Since the notice involved Fan Zuomin, Director of the Provincial Land Administration Bureau, Fan sent senior officials from the Land Administration Bureau to lobby that day. As a result of the lobbying, most of the newspapers did not receive the notice. Only the Henan Minguo Daily received the notice. Moreover, because of the urgent operation, the newspaper had already typeset the original notice and was about to print it, and refused to withdraw the edition. The personnel who went to operate reported back to Director Fan, who was very anxious and uneasy. Therefore, late that night, he personally went to the Henan Minguo Daily and asked President Zhao Peiwu of the newspaper to cancel the notice. At that time, 4,004 copies of pages two and three of the Minguo Daily had already been printed, and the original notice had been printed on page one. After repeated discussions, Zhao agreed that Fan would purchase all the printed newspapers at the original price of 150 yuan per copy at an 80% discount, totaling 480,480 yuan. He also paid an overtime fee of 70,000 yuan, totaling 550,480 yuan, to withdraw the original notice. As a result, no one knew the content of the notice. However, on the 6th, many people in Kaifeng knew about this incident. According to a reporter who learned from an investigator at the Supervisory Envoy's Office, the original text of the notice was as follows: "Notice from the Fangcheng County Association in Bian Questioning County Magistrate Zhao Zuoan: Since the Anti-Japanese War, Fangcheng has suffered from natural and man-made disasters, with deep wounds and pain, and the people cannot live. In the 34th year, when collecting military grain, in addition to the extreme poverty, we still uphold the meaning of 'contributing everything we have to the country,' and painfully transported the blood and sweat earned from a year of hard work. As the shepherd of the people, how can you feign ignorance of this situation? The superiors, mindful of the people's difficulties, allocated the funds early. In order to eliminate corruption, the amount of grain price due to each county was published in the major newspapers of the provincial capital, and the people of the whole of Henan have witnessed it. However, the 129 million yuan for the Fangcheng grain price from March to June disappeared after you, the magistrate, claimed it. The people have been waiting anxiously, but there is no news. After public recommendation, Sun Luzhan, Secretary of the County Council, Yuan Ziyu, representative of the Youth League, and Zhu Wenbin, former Chief of the Grain Administration Section, went to Bian to inquire in various ways. They learned that you, the magistrate, withdrew the funds from the Central Bank on July 18th and handed over 110 million yuan to Fan Zuomin, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, to engage in business like Tao Zhu. The rest ordered Clerk Xue Binqing to take it to Luohe for 'special light management.' Secretary Sun met Fan Zuomin, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, on September 25th (possibly a mistake for September 15th) and strongly stated the suffering of the people of Fangcheng. Fan finally agreed to hand over 10 million yuan in cash, 80 million yuan to Xuchang, and 10 million yuan each to Wan and other counties. The shortfall will be returned by Xue when he returns. The facts are provided, and there are telegrams from the staff and you, the magistrate, as evidence. Now, this association has decided to raise three questions to you: (1) The people of Fangcheng are poor and desolate. The above-mentioned military grain price has been taken out for nearly three months. How can you bear to hand over this money to others for remote use? (2) It is strictly forbidden to use public funds for business. Clerk Xue Bin of your grain administration office took the money to Luohe and has been staying there without returning. Whether the remaining money is remitted in installments to various places violates the official regulations? (3) Since you, the magistrate, used this money for 'Tao Zhu's business,' calculating at the usual interest rate of 2% per month, the profit is no less than 60 or 70 million. Should this income be included in your private pocket? We hope that you will give a clear answer to the above three items as soon as possible. This money must be borne by every man, woman, and child among the 400,000 people in Fangcheng, and it is the kindness of the central government. Everyone is looking forward to it like a drought expecting rain. We hope that you will donate a small amount and tell the truth frankly! Association Address: No. 17, Houjie Street, Sansheng Temple."

### After the Incident of the Notice, Suspicions in Society Increased

Since the small episode of publishing the notice, people in the society have become increasingly suspicious of Director Fan. The supervisory and disciplinary agencies have also paid special attention to Fan. As a reporter, I have always followed the eyes of the general public. Wherever everyone looks, I pay special attention to it. Fan has naturally become one of the important interview targets for reporters. However, Fan has been very mysterious these days, and even his shadow cannot be seen. It is said that he goes out at dawn and returns late at night, looking dejected and flustered, running around and lobbying everywhere. But this does not reduce his suspicion. On the contrary, because of his appearance, the investigators of the supervisory and disciplinary agencies are even more careful in their investigation. According to the most reliable news obtained by the reporter from the investigators, the process of receiving the money at that time, the situation of distribution after receiving the money, and the situation of withdrawing and remitting the money after the incident are as follows: On July 18th, the Henan Provincial Field Grain Office issued a check for 129 million yuan for Fangcheng military grain price, with the check number being 1227, 661985. On July 19th, Xue Binqing went to the Central Bank and withdrew all the money. However, Xue only took 29 million yuan, deposited 10 million yuan in Huiyuan Bank, and temporarily deposited the remaining 100 million yuan in the Central Bank in the name of "Visitor." On July 23rd, Shi Shunhua of Huiyuan Bank, holding the "Visitor" passbook, went to the Central Bank and withdrew 70 million yuan. On August 1st, Shi Shunhua of Huiyuan Bank again took the "Visitor" passbook to the Central Bank and withdrew 30 million yuan. Xue Binqing took the 19 million yuan he received and bought 100 pieces of cloth, 4 bags of heroin, and 5 large boxes of record paper in Bian, and transported them to Luohe accompanied by Wang of Fangcheng. (Another investigator confirmed that the 5 large boxes of record paper were purchased from Da You Paper Factory in Bian and have not yet been shipped.) The remaining 110 million yuan was deposited by Fan Zuomin in Huiyuan Bank in the name of "Fang Ji," and then used the Bank of China as a springboard to deposit the money in China, Jiaotong, and Jincheng Banks, and finally all deposited in Huiyuan Bank. (Note: Huiyuan Bank is a private bank composed of important figures in the military, political, and financial circles of this province.) How the money was withdrawn secretly and what activities were carried out during the period of deposit in Huiyuan Bank is still under investigation by the Supervisory Envoy's Office. According to unconfirmed news, the money has been taken to Shanghai to purchase goods, and the goods have been transported to Xuzhou, waiting for news to be transported to Bian.) And in September, the representatives of Fangcheng came to the province to investigate the money. Fan Zuomin and Huiyuan Bank said that the money had been used for other purposes and could not be raised for a while, and they were afraid of being exposed. Therefore, during those days in mid-September, Huiyuan Bank's funds were extremely tight. If someone went to the bank to withdraw money or make private loans, the person in charge of the bank would say: "We have no way to raise 70 million yuan in urgent funds these days!" However, the representatives of Fangcheng kept begging bitterly. With no other choice, Fan Zuomin and Huiyuan Bank jointly went out to lobby. Because Huiyuan Bank had frequent dealings with various banks, they obtained a receipt from China, Jincheng, and Jiaotong Banks (20 million yuan from the Bank of China, 35 million yuan from the Jiaotong Bank, and 4.6 million yuan from the Jincheng Bank), totaling 59.6 million yuan in cash. Huiyuan Bank took a check for 24 million yuan (check number B038639, account number 742), totaling 83.6 million yuan. On September 17th, Director Fan personally went to the Provincial Bank in the name of "Fang Ji" and remitted 80 million yuan to the Xuchang Provincial Bank (Fangcheng is closer to Xuchang, and there is no bank in Fangcheng). After deducting the remittance fee, there was a balance of 3,173,333 yuan. Director Fan did not consider that someone would come to check the accounts later, so without even thinking about it, he asked the Provincial Bank to deposit the more than 3 million yuan in the Land Administration Bureau's temporary account. Director Fan later regretted this very much, but the investigators regarded this as precious evidence. On September 18th and 24th, 10 million yuan each was remitted to Xiangxian and Yexian by the Provincial Bank.

On the 13th, Zhao Zuoan and others had already been escorted to Bian and detained by the Security Command. Chairman Liu, fearing that these criminals would collude with each other, personally issued an order prohibiting the criminals from meeting with the outside world. Director Fan Zuomin tried every means to meet Zhao Zuoan. It is said that Chairman Liu also wrote a note allowing him to meet, but he was blocked by the guards. On the 14th of this month, Liu Wenbin, the investigation section chief of the Henan-Shandong Supervisory Envoy's Office, went to the Provincial Security Command to interrogate Zhao Zuoan, Xue Binqing, Zhu Wenbin, and others. It is reported that Zhao Zuoan confessed that he did not know anything about the fraud in this case, and that Xue Binqing and Fan Zuomin should be responsible. Xue Binqing confessed that he was ordered by County Magistrate Zhao to go to the province to collect the money, and that he did not know anything about the fraud after the money was handed over to Director Fan. Zhu Wenbin, because he did not participate in the collection of money from beginning to end, of course could not ask anything.

These days, everyone in Shacheng is talking about this case. Some are praising it, some are denouncing it, some are feeling sorry for their own kind, and some are harboring ulterior motives and echoing it. It is a busy time for Jingang, and it is also a busy time for a large number of investigators from the Supervisory Envoy's Office. Chairman Liu is sick and does not work or see guests, but it is said that he attaches great importance to this case. It is said that because he wants to strictly handle the case, he does not advocate sending the entire case to the court. He wants to use military law to handle it more quickly. Many cold-eyed people are staring, waiting to see if Chairman Liu has the determination to kill two corrupt officials:

The Supervisory Envoy's Office summoned Fan Zuomin this afternoon. Fan looked flustered and said about the case: "Helping friends has led to this trouble. I really didn't expect it! This time, I collected the military grain price for Fangcheng. At that time, the delay was caused by the inconvenience of remittance, which caused misunderstandings from all parties. I am very sad." He also said: "I hope that this case will not be expanded. If it is expanded, I am afraid that too many people will be involved and affect the overall situation..." According to a senior investigator from the Supervisory Envoy's Office, the evidence for the entire case has been collected completely, the investigation is over, and the indictment is being sorted out and will be issued soon.

This ugly drama is too ugly, because of its performance, the Henan political stage has become dirty. When will it end? From what time will this kind of ugly drama never be staged on the Henan political stage? Everyone is suffering and hoping in grief and anger!

After Yuan Shikai dissolved the Kuomintang, in December of the second year of the Republic of China, he convened a political conference. Its main tasks, in addition to dissolving the National Assembly and the provincial assemblies, were to revise the Provisional Constitution. On January 24th of the third year, the Regulations on the Organization of the Legislative Conference were agreed upon, and the Legislative Conference was established. At the meeting, Yuan sent the outline for amending the Provisional Constitution to the meeting. After it was approved, Yuan promulgated it on May 1st of the third year of the Republic of China. The content of the new constitution greatly increased the power of the president. In December of the fourth year of the Republic of China, Yuan declared himself emperor. The provinces rose up to denounce him. Yuan knew that the general trend was over and ordered the restoration of the republic, still calling himself president. He soon died of illness. Li Yuanhong took office as president, restored the Provisional Constitution of the first year of the Republic of China, reconvened the National Assembly, and organized a Constitutional Conference to continue working based on the Tian Tan draft constitution. In June of the sixth year, Zhang Xun entered Beijing, and the National Assembly was dissolved for the second time, and the constitutional work was again shelved.

Because of the issue of participating in the war, the Duan Qirui Cabinet and the National Assembly had different opinions. Li, under the pressure of force, issued an order to dissolve the National Assembly, and then resigned as president. Feng Guozhang succeeded him and still appointed Duan as premier. Feng and Duan were in power, disregarding the old National Assembly, and formed a temporary Senate, which discussed and agreed on the National Assembly Organization Law and Election Law, which were formally promulgated by Feng in the seventh year of the Republic of China.

The Founding Father believed that the Beijing government's tacit approval of Li's illegal dissolution of the National Assembly violated the spirit of the covenant and went to Guangdong to advocate the protection of the constitution. The members of the Senate and House of Representatives who went south formed an extraordinary meeting, declared that the formal National Assembly and the Constitutional Conference's review committee would be reopened, but no concrete results were obtained. Therefore, in January of the ninth year, Speaker Lin Sen announced the temporary suspension of constitutional discussions.

In June of the eleventh year, Li Yuanhong resumed his position as president and revoked the order to dissolve the National Assembly for the second time. The National Assembly was able to convene in Beijing and agreed to complete the constitution before the end of August of the twelfth year and to hold presidential elections before the end of September. Unexpectedly, in June of the twelfth year, Li was forced to step down again. The members of the National Assembly moved south one after another. Northern politicians did not hesitate to bribe members to move south. A part of them even returned north again, and the National Assembly convened in September. On October 5th, Cao Kun's bribery election was completed, and he was elected president with 480 votes. The constitution was also hastily passed and promulgated within a few days.

In November of the thirteenth year, Duan Qirui took office as executive, without convening the National Assembly or recognizing the constitution that had been hastily passed in the twelfth year, but only promulgated the Regulations on the Post-Affairs Conference. In February of the fourteenth year, he continued to promulgate the Regulations on the National Representative Conference, whose task was to formulate the constitution and its implementing rules. Duan also organized a Constitution Drafting Committee, which passed a draft constitution of the Republic of China. However, the organization of the committee itself was questionable and had not been submitted to the National Representative Conference for resolution.

After the death of the Founding Father, the Political Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang resolved to reform the Revolutionary Government into the National Government and passed the National Government Organization Law, which was the ancestor of the fundamental organization law of the National Government of our country. In March of the sixteenth year, the National Government was reorganized and the National Government Organization Law was revised. In February of the seventeenth year, it was revised again. In October of the same year, the Five-Power Constitution was officially promulgated and adopted, still called the National Government Organization Law.

In November of the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee resolved to convene a National Convention. The National Convention was held in Nanjing on May 5th of the twentieth year and formulated 89 articles of the "Provisional Constitution of the Period of Political Tutelage," which was promulgated by the National Government on June 1st and was the fundamental law of the period of political tutelage.

The brewing of the Chinese constitutional movement gradually matured after these several attempts and setbacks. In December of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Kuomintang was held and resolved to convene a National Assembly to formulate a constitution and end political tutelage. After more than three years of preparation, the Fifth Five Constitution Draft was promulgated, which was the constitutional blueprint discussed in this National Assembly.

### Anecdotes of Nai Bili's Trip Abroad: Quoting a Proverb: A Narrow Place Can Be Lived in, But a Narrow Mind Cannot Get Along

— Our Travel Reporter Huang Jiesun sent from Bangkok on the 29th

Siamese Elder Pali (also known as Nai Bili) first traveled to our country by special plane during his trip abroad to visit the major powers. This is a grand event after the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Siam, and it is also a milestone in the diplomatic relations between China and Siam. Whether the diplomatic relations between China and Siam can be further advanced and whether Siam, which is suffering from the difficulties of being controlled by others, can get rid of its difficulties depends entirely on the results of this trip by the elder. On the eve of Pali's departure, he said to reporters: I have the opportunity to visit China this time. For me, it is an opportunity to increase my knowledge, but the other task is to make the diplomatic relations between China and Siam closer. In short, my visit to your country can include three points: first, to enhance the friendship of the allied countries; second, to pay tribute to Chairman Chiang. I and the people of Siam are very grateful for Chairman Chiang's constant insistence on helping Siam to protect the integrity of Siamese territory and sovereignty. During the Anti-Japanese War, I heard Chairman Chiang's statement on the radio that the Chinese group would support Siam to the end, which really strengthened my determination to resist Japan. Third, as Ambassador Li said, the Chinese government and all the people do not regard my visit to your country as a distant guest, but invite me with the love of a brother, and I feel infinite comfort. At the same time, it also reminds me of two proverbs: "A narrow place can be lived in, but a narrow mind cannot get along." Due to the solemn and sincere expression of the Chinese government and people, the relationship between the two countries is already in an extremely close state.

Luan Pali, also known as Nai Bili, was born in the Siamese province of Ayutthaya and is 47 years old. His ancestral home is Xiatang Township, Chenghai, Guangdong. His Chinese name is Chen Jiale. Bili means "happiness" in Siamese, which is taken from the word "le". There are four brothers. Luan Pali is the eldest. His second brother, Hanchu, was educated in China and is now the president of Ayutthaya Bank in Siam. His third brother is currently the Siamese ambassador to Switzerland; his fourth brother is deceased.

### Review of the Constitutional Movement: From the Provisional Constitution to the Fifth Five Constitution Draft

— Our Newspaper Archive

After the Wuchang Uprising, fourteen provinces successively declared independence, but they all acted on their own and did not seek each other. The governors of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces advocated the establishment of a unified government organization. On the twenty-fifth day of the ninth lunar month in the Xinhai year, a meeting of provinces was held in Shanghai, which recognized Wuchang as the central military government of the Republic of China, and the governor of the Hubei army carried out central government affairs. In response to the request of the governor of Hubei, the provinces sent representatives to Wuchang to discuss the organization of the provisional government. As a result, on the thirteenth day of the tenth month, the outline of the "Organization of the Provisional Government of the Republic of China" was passed, which was the first fundamental law after the establishment of the Republic of China.

Shortly after the recovery of Nanjing, the Founding Father returned to China from Europe and was elected as the provisional president and established the Nanjing government. On January 28th of the first year of the Republic of China, after the establishment of the Senate, a drafting committee for the constitution was organized to engage in the drafting of the provisional constitution. After its completion, it was promulgated by the president on March 11th and was called the "Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China".

### Suggestions for Expanding Banking Business

— Yu Zengkang

In recent years, numerous banks have been established, creating a flourishing scene unprecedented in history. Is this truly genuine prosperity? However, in reality, improper business practices have reached an extreme. Banks have abandoned legitimate business operations, pursuing only high profits. In this pursuit, they resort to any means, providing assistance to speculators or engaging in usury. Some even directly engage in speculative hoarding, hoping for temporary gains. Such business development deviates from the original purpose of establishing banks. Is this truly beneficial to the banks themselves? Banking prosperity built on speculation and usury cannot last, as past precedents have repeatedly shown. Why then does the banking industry repeat its mistakes without seeking to extricate itself, and instead continues to deepen its predicament, leading to lurking crises? The reasons can be attributed to the following:

(1) Although China's banking industry has experienced remarkable development, the overall system is not yet soundly established. Consequently, the direction of development is often determined by the economic environment. The current economic situation is worsening, making banking operations even more unreasonable. The ineffectiveness of past passive management is evidence of this.

(2) The financial strength of China's banking industry has always been weak. Today, numerous small banks and financial institutions compete, further dispersing financial power. Moreover, deposits are declining both in quantity and quality. Therefore, available funds have decreased to extremely low levels, rendering banks incapable of financial regulation. Furthermore, rising costs and substantial expenses add to the difficulties, inevitably forcing banks to deviate from the right path, pursuing high profits to sustain themselves.

(3) China's financial sector and industry have traditionally been disconnected. With industry and commerce now deeply mired in crisis, the banking industry is naturally unwilling to provide further regulation of industrial credit.

This unreasonable trend is not only detrimental to the banks themselves but also harmful to the entire economy. Given that the post-war economy urgently needs reconstruction, such a situation cannot be allowed to continue. However, improvement is not easy. The aforementioned causes are so complex that it is no wonder passive measures have been ineffective.

To improve the current situation, break out of the predicament, and expand business operations to fully exert regulatory effectiveness, we believe that the first step is to enhance financial strength, and the second is to assist in opening up new avenues for capital investment. Both of these points address the aforementioned abnormal state and are indispensable. Without enhancing financial strength, it is impossible to regulate industrial finance. If financial strength is actively enhanced but there are no new investment avenues, the distress of financial capital lacking legitimate outlets will reappear. Therefore, no single measure alone can save the banking industry from crisis or contribute to economic development.

(1) Methods to Enhance the Financial Strength of the Banking Industry

Enhancing financial strength is a prerequisite for business operations. The financial strength of banks can be divided into two categories: capital stock and deposits. In this era of advanced credit, although deposits have become the primary source of bank funds, capital stock remains the foundation of bank credit. According to the experience of various countries, increases in deposits are directly proportional to the strength of capital. Strong capital leads to solid credit, which enhances the ability to attract deposits. Therefore, the banks with the largest deposits are also those with the most substantial capital. In recent years, to adapt to the development of credit, banks in various countries have actively increased capital. Small banks have found it difficult to compete and are gradually being eliminated. Consequently, the lack of continued bank concentration has become a major problem. Therefore, to rescue the current financial crisis, increasing capital stock is paramount. Moreover, Chinese commercial banks must also engage in industrial credit, making it even more necessary to actively increase capital. In the past, restrictions on capital amounts led to the proliferation of small banks. When speculative booms occurred, they flourished. Such development is extremely dangerous, and this trend must be corrected in the future. Although the draft amendment to the Banking Law has raised the minimum capital requirement, it is still too low in the context of industrialization and cannot effectively prevent the trend of capital dispersion. Whether from an economic or banking standpoint, there is a need for further increases in capital stock. It is better to eliminate some small banks to consolidate the financial foundation. When necessary, we must also promote mergers to align with the global trend of financial concentration. To promote mergers, we should not restrict banks from being shareholders in other banks, and we should encourage large banks to participate in the capital of small banks. Given that small banks have low capital, they are easily manipulated by large banks. Holding more than one-third of the shares would allow mergers to proceed. In the past, many have advocated for mergers, but they have also recognized the numerous difficulties and deemed it unsuitable for China. However, the question lies in how to successfully acquire shares in small banks, which is worthy of in-depth research. China's banks have numerous factions, and their operating methods are not entirely the same. Furthermore, shareholders are unwilling to rashly relinquish their shares to others, fearing the loss of control. This is the greatest obstacle to mergers. However, we can leverage financial and creditor pressure to force restructuring, allowing large banks to participate in shareholding. Alternatively, we can force struggling institutions to liquidate and allow large banks to acquire them. These methods have numerous precedents in various countries and have proven highly effective, and China should emulate them.

If capital can be actively increased and concentrated, the ability to attract deposits will also be enhanced. The current sharp decline in deposits is only a temporary phenomenon. If the economy can stabilize, social capital will return to the banking industry. Although the pre-war situation was better than the present, it was still not ideal. Deposit amounts were very small, insufficient to bear the responsibility of regulating industrial credit. However, industrial scale was small, and the required capital was not substantial, so it could still be managed. In the future, with industrialization and expanded scale, the demand for capital will increase sharply. To effectively regulate, banks must have more capital. Therefore, it is necessary to actively promote savings policies to concentrate social capital, enhance available fixed capital, and expand credit to increase demand deposits and replenish working capital. The past deposit policy needs to be revised. More importantly, to avoid capital waste and expand operational capabilities, we must quickly establish close relationships between the central bank and commercial banks. Improvements to the deposit reserve system and the use of rediscounting and open market policies will allow banks to minimize their cash reserves and interbank deposits. With the central bank providing assistance, the banking industry will dare to engage in large-scale industrial credit with slower turnover.

While the deposit policy needs to be improved in normal times, what about the current situation? We are still in an extraordinary state, and the economy continues to fluctuate. There is no hope for a quick return of social capital to the financial industry. Can this situation be allowed to continue? Should we not seek rapid improvement? Even if the banking industry's current 200 billion in deposits could be safely used, it would still be insufficient to meet the needs of all industries. If the deposit situation continues to deteriorate, banks will ultimately find it difficult to abandon the pursuit of high-profit businesses. To rescue industry and the banking industry itself from crisis, we must quickly seek to enhance deposit capital. Although social capital is still fluctuating, and because of the narrowing avenues for speculation and the dangers of usury, some capital is considering stability. Timely absorption is a good opportunity. The way to absorb is to increase deposit interest rates. Would raising deposit interest rates not increase costs and exacerbate difficulties? While this is true, raising deposit interest rates can attract more deposits. Increased deposits can expand business and increase profits. Separating deposit and loan interest rates was originally a last resort. Currently, deposit interest rates are too low to arouse the interest of depositors. As a result, social capital risks private lending or is deposited in underground banks in pursuit of high profits. If bank deposit interest rates can be appropriately raised, even if they are not half as high as underground rates, people, for the sake of principal and interest safety, will be willing to deposit in banks. This refers to fixed deposits. As for demand deposits, which have frequent turnover, raising interest rates would only increase the burden and be of no benefit to the bank. Furthermore, demand depositors seek convenience of payment rather than high interest rates. Therefore, high interest rates cannot increase deposit amounts. To increase demand deposits, we must rely on the development of the credit system. Therefore, raising interest rates should be limited to fixed deposits, and demand deposits do not require it. Although this will increase the cost of bank funds, the increase in fixed deposits will improve the current state of bank capital and help consolidate the foundation of the banking industry.

(2) Opening New Avenues for Investment in Industry

After enhancing financial strength, it is necessary to guide the opening of new investment avenues. Otherwise, as in the past, the distress of lacking legitimate outlets will reappear, which will be detrimental to the entire economy and the banks themselves.

Before the war, although various banks gradually made efforts to engage in industrial credit, industrial loans still accounted for only about 10% of total loans. The difficulty of expanding the business of regulating industrial credit can be imagined. Currently, bank lending operations are restricted by the deposit situation. The amount has decreased sharply, and the content has also changed. Term loans account for less than 2%. This small amount cannot meet the needs of industrial credit. As a result, the industry has had to request financial assistance from national banks.

Recognizing that the banking industry does not value industrial lending and that industry urgently needs capital, the authorities stipulated in the regulations for managing banks the minimum amount of lending to industrial and mining enterprises, but also imposed the restriction that they cannot invest in industry as shareholders. Such regulations are contradictory. Without becoming shareholders, how can they be encouraged to invest in industry? Providing only short-term credit and not supplying long-term capital does not help industrial construction. The management regulations based on the extraordinary state may still be acceptable, but the draft amendment to the Banking Law based on the normal state should no longer adopt this attitude. Given that China's financial sector and industry have traditionally been disconnected, we should not add more restrictions if we want to connect them. Therefore, the implementation of the management regulations has been merely symbolic, with no practical benefit. To make bank funds available for production enterprises, we must guide and encourage them and provide investment convenience.

German banks adopt a universal banking system. We can emulate its examples and have a rational division of bank fund use. This can serve as an important reference for the amendment of our Banking Law. Short-term funds regulate commercial credit, and fixed funds regulate industrial credit. This way, long-term and short-term funds can each find their place, without any difficulties. This is much more rational than forcing the use of 50% or 30% of total deposits. Moreover, using short-term funds for industrial credit is extremely dangerous and harms the foundation of banks. It is not overly difficult for Chinese industries to borrow short-term funds, but it is extremely difficult to raise initial capital. Therefore, we should not restrict the assistance of the banking industry. The Banking Law should further encourage banks to participate as promoters of industry and in the underwriting of stocks. Banks adding shareholders can guide operations, and with guaranteed profits, they will dare to invest heavily. Underwriting stocks can generate huge profits as industry prospers. This is the only way to enhance the banking industry's interest in investing in industry.

Furthermore, the failure to clearly delineate the business of state-owned and commercial banks not only fails to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation but also creates a situation where the government and the private sector compete for profits. That is, instead of assisting commercial banks in their operations, the adjustment of industrial funds is supplied by state-owned banks. This is also a major reason hindering the expansion of banking business. It is no longer reasonable to rely on issuing currency to supply industrial funds. Coupled with the poor supply methods, this is not the phenomenon that a smooth industrial finance system should have. National banks should quickly specialize and become the central institutions for all types of credit, avoiding direct lending to avoid competition with commercial banks. They should also provide maximum financing and support, which will stimulate the expansion of banking business.

The above two methods must be implemented simultaneously to fully exert their respective roles. These two points are also the two key points of this amendment to the Banking Law, and the authorities also intend to concentrate financial power and adopt a universal banking system. However, there are too many overly cautious restrictive clauses, and the original intention of the amendment may not be realized. The banking industry will inevitably remain confused and find it difficult to comply, which will affect the establishment of a rational banking system. Therefore, this point still needs to be discussed and revised to suit the national conditions and give the banking industry a new dynamism.

### British Industry in Recovery

— Xueyan

People outside of Britain all know that Britain is one of the world's three great powers today. Amidst the opposition between the US and the Soviet Union, Britain is in the middle, playing a balancing role. This is truly one aspect of Britain's diplomacy, which is relatively flamboyant and captivating. However, the status of a great power cannot be attained by simply standing in line or by gracefully yielding in international conferences or by playing a silent role like a "Mr. Guo" in the Security Council of the United Nations. It requires real strength as a backing and support. It is undeniable that Britain suffered considerable economic losses in this war. Overseas investments were almost completely sold or mortgaged, and the people's lives are also very difficult. Therefore, the most pressing post-war problems are increasing national wealth and improving the people's lives. Those inside Britain today are most concerned with these two matters. The entire nation is focusing its efforts on these two matters.

After more than a year of effort, Lord President of the Council Morrison, who is responsible for overseeing the nation's economic construction, yesterday specially hosted a press conference to report and review the state of Britain's production recovery. He was able to say with great pride, "A country that was on the verge of bankruptcy a year ago has today caught up with or surpassed many countries on the industrial front." He was not just boasting, as there are concrete facts to support his statement. This year, the production volume of British industry has not been lower in any month than the production volume of April 1935. As for exports, considering only the first three quarters, they have increased by at least 10% compared to the same period in 1939. Being able to both recover and expand production simultaneously and achieve such results is unparalleled in the world. No wonder Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton, after returning from the United Nations Bank Conference in the United States, said in his first speech, "The speed and smoothness with which British production has recovered from wartime to peacetime has won the praise of the entire world."

Returning from the Military to Industry

Britain's construction work over the past year can be divided into three aspects: (1) Soldier demobilization, rapidly transforming the military into a productive workforce. The best way to illustrate the achievements in this area is with numbers. According to the Ministry of Defence, from the time Japan surrendered until August of this year, a total of seven million British soldiers were demobilized. These seven million people have been transported back to Britain from all over the world and integrated into various production departments, engaging in work. According to a report published by the Ministry of Labour on the 17th of this month, there are currently over 20.01 million people engaged in production work, an increase of approximately 400,000 people compared to the 19.7 million in mid-1939. Among them, the number employed by factories at the end of August this year was over 4.88 million, an increase of about 200,000 compared to the 4.68 million in the same period in 1939. From these comparative figures, it is clear that the utilization of labor in Britain has not only returned to pre-war levels but has also improved compared to pre-war levels.

(2) Industrial recovery, which involves restoring factories that were shut down or converted during the war to produce peacetime goods and increasing the production of certain particularly needed items. Achievements in this area are more difficult to describe and cannot be fully expressed by simple numbers. This is because firstly, there is the issue of raw materials. Britain itself does not produce raw materials, and the raw material production areas that Britain relied on before the war have yet to recover after being affected by the war, thus affecting production. The most obvious example is China itself. Before the war, Britain imported some raw materials from China, but currently, China simply cannot export. Even if there are available goods, the prices are too high to consider. Secondly, there is the issue of transportation. Whether it is importing raw materials or exporting finished products, all are subject to limitations in transport capacity, which naturally also affects production.

Control and Planning

(3) Control issues. If various industries are allowed to recover and develop freely, it will inevitably create an abnormal state. The most profitable products will expand the fastest, leading to competition for workers and raw materials, while the industries that are truly needed by society will be squeezed to the back and unable to recover. As a result, social chaos, rising prices, and economic bankruptcy will inevitably occur. Therefore, Britain is adopting a control policy. The order and magnitude of industrial recovery must be based on priority levels before raw materials can be purchased and workers can be hired. Therefore, industrial recovery is not simply restoring the pre-war state but making reasonable improvements based on pre-war experience.

The final point relates to a policy: promoting socialism. Equality in living standards is a major factor in contemporary political discourse. The wealth disparity in Britain is not as stark as in the United States, nor is it as distorted as in China, where millions of people are starving and countless people are living in misery with insufficient clothing and food, while at the same time, some people are profiting from the national crisis, the victory, and corruption, desperately stuffing gold and American dollars into the vaults of foreign banks. But no matter what, Britain also has a large wealth gap, and this gap has become more acute due to the war. The reason why the Labour Party was able to win and govern is that its policies gradually narrowed this gap between the rich and poor, changing the way social wealth and enjoyment are distributed. Therefore, the mission after taking power is to realize this policy. The concrete manifestation of this is various nationalization policies. The largest of these, such as coal mines, the Bank of England, fuel, and energy, have already begun nationalization. In addition, industries such as railways and telecommunications will also be implemented soon. Other goals, such as the socialization of medical care, the implementation of social insurance systems, the design of a 40-hour work week, and the popularization of higher education, are all aimed at improving the enjoyment of the majority of people. The Labour Party government's achievements over the past year have also been considerable, and the people's trust in them is noteworthy. Since taking office in August last year, the Labour Party has won 19 out of 19 by-elections for vacant parliamentary seats and has never lost a seat. According to Dalton, a government that can still win every election a year after taking office is the first since 1874.

Labour Party's Outstanding Achievements

It would be difficult enough to do just one of these three major tasks well, but the Labour Party government has been able to advance them simultaneously, demonstrating exceptional abilities. We have long known that Britain's exports are gradually returning to pre-war levels, and some products have even exceeded them. Yesterday, Morrison further detailed several production figures at the press conference, proving this point. The main ones are steel, which increased by 18% in August compared to the same period in 1935 and by 13% compared to the same period in 1938. Aluminum had a monthly production of 1,250 tons in 1935, while this year's monthly production has increased by an average of one time. Machine Tools increased by 50% compared to 1935. Light bulbs had an annual production of 100 million in 1935, and this year they can produce 180 million. Alarm clocks and other items were not produced in Britain before the war, but they are now being manufactured in large quantities.

People's Lives Still Not as Ideal

Although production is increasing, the most important phenomenon in British life today is still the lack of goods. What is the reason for this? According to official reports, the following factors combine to explain this:

(1) During the war, many daily necessities were only destroyed or damaged, lacking repair and replenishment. The work that has accumulated over several years now needs to be urgently repaired and rebuilt due to the cessation of war. Therefore, many materials and manpower are being diverted to this area. The most obvious examples are the housing problem and the public utilities problem. Currently, the number of workers engaged in construction alone has reached over 1.2 million, and the demand for other building materials is equally large, which naturally affects other products.

(2) Increased demand. According to Morrison, Britain's steel production has now exceeded pre-war levels by 10%, but the demand is far greater than this number. Aluminum production has doubled compared to pre-war levels, but the demand has increased by two times, so it is still insufficient. He also said that the phenomenon of feeling a shortage of goods due to increased demand is healthy. This development has no end, and society progresses by wanting to satisfy this demand. The pre-war phenomenon of overproduction and weak purchasing power was a morbid state. Now that social purchasing power is strong, the production sector should meet this demand. Morrison also said that after the government's efforts to improve the distribution of purchasing power, demand has also increased. For example, the current production of milk, beer, cigarettes, steelware, and electricity in Britain is far greater than before the war, but because the government has worked hard to improve the distribution of people's purchasing power, everyone has the power to enjoy them, and currently they feel insufficient. Therefore, the government's efforts to implement socialism and improve the general purchasing power of the people are also one of the reasons for the current shortage of goods.

Encourage Export Businesses, Domestic Needs Secondary

(3) Manufacturing export goods. Because Britain wants to increase overseas assets, it gives the highest priority in production to manufacturers of export goods. Recently, the Overseas Trade Department held an "Exhibition of Goods Made in Britain but Not Available Domestically," which caused a sensation across the country. To visit it, one had to queue for more than two hours before having the opportunity to enter, which shows how much attention it received. Over 5,000 types of goods were displayed in the middle, all of which were high-quality, finely made products that have already been sold overseas but are temporarily not allowed to be sold domestically. This effort to compete for overseas markets is naturally also a major reason for the shortage of goods.

(4) Contrary to encouraging exports is the strict restriction on imports. Britain has many goods that it relied on overseas imports before the war, such as food and some cosmetics. Food is unavoidable, but it has been reduced to a minimum. Overseas imports of cosmetics have simply disappeared. What people in Britain currently feel most insufficient is imported goods. But because of the rapid increase in exports, it is hoped that this will improve in the future. In fact, life in Britain today is better than it was a year ago.

Conclusion: Two Major Issues

Increasing production and promoting socialism are the most important issues within Britain today. A large portion of the government departments are related to these two matters. However, the Lord President of the Council Morrison is responsible for overseeing and planning these matters. He is the chairman of the Economic Planning Committee. He is one of the most organized, capable, and determined people in the Labour Party. In July of this year, Prime Minister Attlee originally had plans to visit Australia. During Attlee's stay in Australia, the position of Prime Minister was scheduled to be filled by Morrison. The government's announcement had also been made. Later, Attlee cancelled his trip to Australia due to certain matters, so the acting position was no longer needed. The removal of former Minister of Food Smith was rumored to be due to Morrison's dissatisfaction with his work. From these two matters, it can be seen how high Morrison's position is in the government today and how important he is in charge of the nation's production.

### The Influence of Erroneous Psychology

— Author: Wen

The slogan of the "Love Domestic Products Movement", "Using domestic products is the most honorable," is aimed at the common perception that using foreign goods is glorious. Mr. Hu Boxiang, the initiator of this movement, once gave an example: he said that a friend's house displayed many cosmetics, and he was proud of them, thinking they were foreign goods, but in the eyes of an expert, they were not foreign goods at all, but simply used English trademarks and labels.

In fact, this kind of erroneous psychology greatly affects Chinese industry. Due to the prevalence of this psychology, many people have suffered. We may as well give a few examples to illustrate:

First, because Chinese people have the mentality that using foreign goods is glorious, many self-proclaimed clever businessmen ordered many medicines, shawls, raincoats, foods, etc. from foreign countries, but as a result, nine out of ten people lost money, and a large amount of Chinese gold bars flowed abroad. No one benefited, and Chinese industry was the first to be hit. The Chinese market became even more chaotic.

Second, because Chinese people have the mentality that using foreign goods is glorious, speculative merchants imitate foreign goods and attach foreign trademarks. As a result, users are always deceived. In recent times, because flannel was popular for a while, so-called Australian flannel appeared on the market. In fact, it was made in Shanghai using short wool. The quality was inferior, and it broke easily when pulled. In the end, those with erroneous psychology suffered losses themselves.

Third, because people generally think that foreign medicines must be better, the business of Chinese pharmaceutical factories has been greatly affected. In the October issue of "Reader's Digest," there is an article "Quarantine For Dr. Quack" which says that many American pharmaceutical merchants produce substandard products that cannot be sold in the American market, so they export them abroad. This can serve as a warning to those who think that as long as something comes from abroad, it must be excellent and refined.

For the sake of the future of the country's industry, correcting this erroneous psychology can be said to be the most urgent task.

Employee Psychology

(6) Creativity

Creativity is very important when doing any work, because with creativity, work can be improved. This can bring considerable benefits to business organizations, and also provide opportunities for promotion to employees.

Testing method: Regarding this testing method, foreign countries use more than a dozen photos that are known to the general public (such as the Bund in Shanghai, the West Lake in Hangzhou, or famous people, etc.). Below, the descriptions of each photo are annotated in a disorganized way, and then he is asked to correct them. This testing method can also show whether the person being tested can see the mistakes. A person without creativity will not observe ordinary things carefully.

(7) Thoroughness in doing things

This is related to patience and perseverance. A person without patience and perseverance can never do things very thoroughly.

Testing method: You can ask the person being tested to remove the number nine from the following numbers, then remove the number eight, then remove the number seven, and so on down to two.

457321485113478326528593764254931245845318

Each time a number is removed, the numbers that have not been removed can be written down. Write once for each removal.

(8) Agility

Agility in doing things can promote work efficiency. A person with a clear mind should have no problem with this test.

Testing method: You can use the method of filling in sentences, filling them in within a specified time to see if their minds are agile. These fill-in-the-blank questions are easy to formulate, such as:

A. Today - go to the town with me. B. The most important thing a person needs is --.

(9) Management talent

The testing of management talent is more commonly used when hiring senior employees, because junior employees do not urgently need to possess this talent.

Regarding the testing of management talent, you can adopt the methods used in various tests from the ten tests, and add more questions.

(10) Memory

Memory is very important in doing things. A person with a strong memory is also greatly benefited himself, because he can achieve twice the result with half the effort.

Testing method: You can use numbers that are very similar to each other and ask the person being tested to look at them once, and then write them down silently to see if there are any mistakes. The following numbers are very similar, and people without a strong memory may not be able to do it.

7789 7878 34576 348576

During the test, you can adopt the nature of an exam, write all kinds of questions together, and ask employees to answer them in writing. If you want to ask questions orally, then number the questions and fill in the results after the oral test.

Regarding physical examination, it can be conducted by a doctor in charge, using a common health examination form.

Spring and Autumn

### Diary of Deji

— Dai Wangshu

For days, for weeks, for months, I stopped paying attention to myself and did not take care of myself. This is going through a tunnel. After passing through it, one can hope to see a new land... I am often afraid that an overly continuous consciousness will too rationally turn our future into the past and hinder the future. Only night and sleep allow transformation; if there is no oblivion in the chrysalis, the caterpillar will not turn into a butterfly when it wakes up.

This is what has become popular with Palice. His need to constantly look for a lesson, a "homework"—I find it unbearable. This is the mire of spiritual depravity. Those great works only educate us when they immerse us in an almost loving paralysis. I compare those who seek benefits everywhere to prostitutes who ask people "How much will you give me?" before selling their bodies.

When fish die, their bellies face up and float to the surface: this is their way of dying.

When I see some books, I always think: Who will read them? - When I see some people: What books will they read?... Afterwards, this is linked together.

While people are not paying attention, the leaves of the chestnut tree open. Every year, it is the same accident, the same annoyance of being surprised. Spring comes with light footsteps, like Santa Claus for children. Each time, I try again to serve more vigilantly, watching for its arrival; but there is still something mysterious and elusive. I stop thinking about it for a while; my eyes close or turn to read a book... I look up: it is already there.

(Undoubtedly, that is because the greatest effort of plant growth is carried out at night. See also the observations and opinions of Sandan's "Tropical Nature".)

The question of style. People sin due to ignorance, negligence, or boldness. Some writers never receive any blame, but that does not make them the best writers. Few people use grammar correctly and at the same time appear special. But all deliberation is detestable, and the activity of emotions and thoughts does not require it. Few readers can immediately understand the formality of this requirement; most readers only see affectation there. People with ordinary thoughts do not feel the need to express their thoughts in an extraordinary way. However, it is most detestable for a writer to only be bold with the pen.

For me, the loss of the initial importance of these style issues has not been very long. Their loss of initial importance is not that I think they are not very important; but that in my heart, other issues have grown up, have now reached adulthood, have caught up, and have dragged the rest behind. Let it be so.

### From Sexual Psychology - Talking about Havelock Ellis

— Lao Dan

This morning, I happened to see my friend Wei Jun holding a copy of "Sexual Psychology", and I couldn't help but think of the author, Havelock Ellis. So I collected some materials and talked about this Hermes who dominates human thought. Havelock Ellis.

When Havelock Ellis is mentioned, some people always think of the issue of "sex". Naturally, "Sexual Psychology" is his immortal masterpiece, a groundbreaking work in publishing history. It threw a big bomb into the traditional ideological atmosphere of England, causing a very hot commotion in all directions. He was therefore arrested and taken to the government office. As a result, he was convicted of "intending to undermine the morals of the people." This book was also listed as a banned book, and was not allowed to be copied, disseminated, or read. It remained banned for decades, until German and American English versions were published successively, before England was unbanned.

In fact, Havelock Ellis's works are not just "Sexual Psychology". His writing life began with "The New Spirit", which advocated the theory of mental independence. The important principles of sex had already been indicated in it. "The Criminal" uses the perspective of a sexual psychologist to estimate the causes of crime, and is highly praised by Italian criminologists. "Man and Woman" is the prelude to "Sexual Psychology". Although it is not as detailed as "Sexual Psychology", it is also very insightful in the study of sexual psychology. Later, there were also "Affirmations", "The Nineteenth Century", "A Study of British Genius", "The Soul of Spain", "Impressions and Comments", "Love and Jeanne d'Arc Sketches", "The Problem of Today", "From Rousseau to Proust", etc. Speaking of his "From Rousseau to Proust", it reminds people of his "Confessions", published in 1934. He died in the summer of 1939. Then the publication of "Confessions" seems to be a publication after he was seventy-five years old. He made a final self-criticism and confession of his life.

During the First European War, he published "Essays in War-Time" and "The Philosophy of Conflict", which shows that he stood in the position of an artist and contributed to the country and academics, and never stood idly by.

Some people put Havelock Ellis and the author of the Chinese "Shuangmei Yinge Series" in the same category. In this way, their understanding of Havelock Ellis is not only too isolated, but also does not understand the scientific study of sexual psychology. Including all his philosophy, art and the essence of his thought, he also has a great work "The Dance of Life". It is a bit of an underestimation to regard him as the leader of sexual monism by people who are short-sighted.

Havelock Ellis was born in England in February 1859. In his childhood, he followed his parents on a cruise around the world. His academic qualifications changed from literature to medicine. After mastering medicine, he devoted himself to writing. Havelock Ellis and George Bernard Shaw were contemporaries in the same country, and were very good friends and humorists. When Shaw was young, he was down and out and frustrated for more than ten years, and he relied on Havelock Ellis's support to write for the Saturday Review, and Shaw gradually became famous. In his later years, Havelock Ellis wrote "Shaw's Biography", and died shortly after the manuscript was completed. Havelock Ellis handed the manuscript to Shaw in advance to be sorted and printed. There were many profound satirical remarks in the book, such as Wilde's words mocking Shaw, "He has no enemies in his life, and no very good friends." This is really a penetrating statement that completely reveals Shaw's character. Shaw did not change anything in Havelock Ellis's original manuscript except to correct some facts, but only added an "Afterword". In the "Afterword", he also relentlessly quoted Wilde's ridicule of Havelock Ellis in return, "Havelock Ellis has been invited to dinner at the homes of all the princes and nobles." It turned out that Havelock Ellis was unrestrained throughout his life. Whenever he went to a banquet, no matter who was present, he did not speak, which the British regarded as harmful to morals. If he was sitting with a deaconess of the Christian Church, he would indulge in talking about the physical curves of women, treating the church deaconess as a London dancer after the war. If the host knew his temper and separated him from romantic women, he would talk about the sublimity and greatness of Jesus' personality. Therefore, people only invited him "once" (they dared not invite him a second time), and that was the reason. Wilde's criticism can be said to be practical, mocking and abusive.

When Havelock Ellis was about to start writing, Shaw wrote a letter to Shaw, and Shaw panicked and wrote a letter to persuade Havelock Ellis not to write. Havelock Ellis refused. Shaw knew that he could not dissuade him, so he had to provide materials. When the entire manuscript was completed, Havelock Ellis published Shaw's original letter together, making Shaw both laugh and cry. It turned out that although Shaw was humorous, he was unusually cautious in dealing with people, and he was an extremely polite British gentleman. Havelock Ellis, on the other hand, was sometimes unrestrained. When he wrote "Wilde's Biography", he included a lot of descriptions of sexual desire. Even in his confessions, he vividly revealed the obscene experiences of his personal life. (Shaw's wife burned the book because the maid read it. Havelock Ellis despised Shaw's wife very much when he knew about this. Shaw's biography also contained many disrespectful words.) Try to ask, how could Shaw not be shocked when he first heard that Havelock Ellis was going to write a biography for him?

Havelock Ellis was a man of letters and also gifted. Although he was not a fan of Shaw, he was a close friend who knew Shaw well. Therefore, in his writing, he could ridicule and mock as he pleased, without any restraint, and without any need for politeness or taboos. Therefore, this book is particularly vivid. It makes people read it with relish, with humor, mockery, backbone, and deep thought. Every sentence is from the heart. It is a living biography that fully depicts Shaw's inner self and inner mind.

### Still Life

### A Letter from Baghy

— Ren Qi

The name of Julio Baghy, an Esperanto writer from Hungary, is not unfamiliar in China because Ba Jin translated one of his novels, "Spring in Autumn". During the First World War, he was captured by the Russian army. The Russian Revolution broke out again. He had to go through snowy and icy Siberia, where the Red and White Russians were fighting, and was sent back to his country. The impressions during this journey produced two novels, one is "The Sacrificed", which has been translated by Zhong Xianmin, and the other is Sur Sanga Tero "On the Blood-Stained Land", which seems to have not been translated by anyone. No news of him has been heard since the Second World War. Now I know a little news, that is a letter he wrote to the Swedish Esperanto Association at the beginning of this year. The following is the translation of this letter.

Budapest, January 2, 1946

Happy New Year!

Immediately after the terror passed, and after my recovery from three months of blood poisoning, I sat down in front of my writing desk and, taking advantage of my freedom, wrote a forty-page (large format) booklet promoting our language [Translator's note: this refers to Esperanto, same below] and its significance in the coming new era. Naturally, this was written in Hungarian. Then I wrote a very detailed Esperanto grammar for my fellow countrymen. The first book has already been published, and the second book is being printed. In addition, I ran several workshops for those preparing to teach Esperanto and for new believers, and I gave lectures in various schools, factories, fire departments, and cities. I do not want to tell you what kind of personal situation I did all this in. Suffice it to mention that last year I did not eat my fill more than four or five times. Now the food situation is getting worse and worse, and the disaster of starvation is threatening. What to do? Many tens of thousands of people are in the same situation, especially those who, like me, have nothing to sell.

During the war, my home was robbed three times, and now I have almost no clothes to wear in winter. The windows in my house are broken, fuel only exists in theory, and essential food does not even exist in theory. I really don't know how I can get through the freezing season wearing a pair of old galoshes without shoes inside... The depreciation of our currency is already unbearably tragic. I can tell you this for you to imagine: my monthly salary (not the worst salary!) is only enough to buy one and a quarter kilograms of sugar or two liters of oil. If I want to buy clothes, at least six months' total salary is enough for one piece of clothing.

Now I have a paid position in the police of the democratic organization. To be more precise, I am the organizer and cultural worker of the Budapest Police Association. This association is a social education organization of the National Police Department. My work is really excellent, although it requires me to work hard day and night. An Esperanto department has just been established in this association to unite the police who speak Esperanto and educate new messengers. More than two hundred police officers have joined the training class, and this number is increasing every day. If the progress of international peace building is more favorable, this department must become one of the most important organizations of our movement [Esperanto movement - translator] in Hungary. I ask you, if possible, to publicize this new organization, send some books and magazines, write letters, and open up the correspondence of police colleagues who are interested in our cause. You cannot imagine their eagerness for foreign news, how they want to personally experience the various benefits of our language that I, from the side of the propagandist, am teaching them.

Please send the following announcement to the Swedish Esperanto newspaper

"Julio Baghy, Vice President of the Esperanto Academy, sincerely greets his Swedish friends and wishes them a happy new year. He is very willing to receive their letters, and after the postal relations improve, he will try his best to reply. Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to reply immediately now. Address: Budapest, Rottenbiller u. 66 Hungarlando."

The Hungarian Esperanto Workers' Association, which was eliminated in 1933, has been re-established and has begun lively propaganda. Unfortunately, members are busy fighting for a small piece of bread every day, so the whole movement is still stagnant, but... but we have not lost hope. When we meet each other, there is a greeting ESPERON [hope]! This greeting is gradually becoming popular. In addition, I ask you to convey the greetings of my comrades to your members.

Waiting for your reply, I greet you again!

Your friend Julio Baghy

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood 103

— Ye Jingfeng

"Victory Drink". She smiled enchantingly. (Since the Japanese launched military operations against China, many food and beverage products have been renamed with new names, with the meaning of auspicious omens; not to mention that Tsurumi heard it and felt baffled; even the waiters in those shops, tea houses, and restaurants were confused.)

From Tsurumi's point of view, this kind of situation is called "cage door" by the people of Shanghai; it is called "caught the shrimp" or "caught the guys" in the local dialect of Beiping, and the word "stiff" is often used in writing. Please think, what does this situation count as? Communication? Or confrontation? Or a "passing door" of the same line? The first step, it is not easy to determine the attitude of these three natures. If the nature and attitude cannot be determined, and the enemy is mistaken for a friend, or one's own people are regarded as outsiders, one's bottom line will be seen through as soon as one speaks. If one ignores friend or foe, and only takes out the topic of communication to deal with it, it is certainly possible, but that is only if it is expected that the other party is mostly on the side of a friend. Otherwise, according to the rules, one should first show some color to the enemy and give a deterrent. Otherwise, people will think that you are showing weakness; at least they will say that you are "cowardly."

Tsurumi took out his helpless housekeeping skills in this "stiff" situation - "flushing". The scientific term for this "flushing" method is "ionization." It is like a domestic dog seeing a stray dog ​​that does not look pleasing approaching. Before the emotion has been determined to be good or bad, it must first circle the approaching dog's body, and then aim at the stray dog's nose and sniff. This is the dog's usual way. As for people, that certainly cannot be done this way.

Isn't Tsurumi smoking a cigarette? That's right. With a courteous hand, in a grand and artistic way, he took out a delicate cigarette case from the pocket of his tuxedo waistcoat, opened the cigarette case in a very elegant manner, and handed it over politely.

The Chinese Triads, Good Old Society, Robe Brothers Society, and other Jianghu friends, all have ways of drinking tea and smoking cigarettes. Inside and outside the threshold, it can be distinguished only by the gesture of taking the tea bowl and taking the cigarette. Tsurumi could not use this set of methods; there are many reasons, the simplest one: before he has determined which group the other party is a member of, he cannot first reveal his own whereabouts; because the other party is also an expert.

"Thank you." She took one with a smile, and lit the cigarette with the fire handed over by Tsurumi's quick gesture. "Thank you", then smiled slightly again, immediately followed by a slight wrinkle of her painted eyebrows, completing a frown after the smile. After this frown, she slightly raised her carefully made-up eyelids and glanced at Tsurumi charmingly. This glance was full of emotions of resentment:

"Mr. Tsurumi," she asked softly, restoring her natural smile, "Don't you really feel my rudeness?"

At this time, the so-called "Victory Drink" was brought up just right. What exactly is it? It turned out to be a large glass of amber-colored liquid, not very transparent. The Chinese way of saying it in English is "Orange Squash", and the literal translation found in the Anglo-Chinese Dictionary by the Europeanized faction is "orange crushed liquid."

### The Sea of People

— Shaofu

Despite the progress of aviation, which has shortened the distance between the world, there are still various "walls" between people, making it impossible for everyone to get close and touch.

Taking Shanghai, which has a population of four million, for example, perhaps only an atomic bomb is needed to wipe it all out, but among these four million people, countless stories of tragedy are being produced.

You are walking on the road, just turning your head to look at a cashmere sweater in the shop window, and in that second, your long-awaited friend, whom you have been separated from for ten years, walks past you, missing you. This is one example.

Secondly, your past lover or girlfriend happens to meet you in the same hotel, but unfortunately, either her husband is next to her, or your wife is with you, so you can only look at each other in your heart. This is also an example.

The masses of living beings, the vast sea of people, encounters almost become a matter of heavenly descent rather than human pursuit. This often leads to legends, and people are dazzled by them and feel small.

News and Information

### Where Did This Giant Python Come From? It Actually Repelled Tanks

— Huang Jieqing

On the 23rd, this newspaper reported that a giant 800-year-old python had been discovered on the Burma Road, which swallowed soldiers and was not afraid of tanks.

In mythological stories, we often see thrilling tales of giant pythons and snakes. The unofficial history of the "Legend of the White Snake" is also told vividly. However, most of these are fictional and cannot be believed. Unexpectedly, a strange real-life myth has appeared in today's scientific age. Moreover, this giant python actually confronted the authoritative weapon of today, the tank, swallowing soldiers and unafraid of bullets. Later, the Americans ended the existence of this rare and strange python by dropping several giant bombs from bombers. These are truly astonishing times!

It is said that there were rumors about this giant python even before the War of Resistance, but during the war, it may have lived deep in the jungle and was not discovered. Now that the Burma Road is no longer a battlefield, it carelessly lies on the highway.

According to reports, this giant python is truly enormous and incredibly dangerous. What exactly happened remains to be reported by biologists. We believe that it may not be as astonishing as the telegrams report.

Here, let's talk about some things related to "Mr. Snake":

Originally, snakes like humid and warm environments, so the tropics are where the most snakes are found. According to a Japanese biologist named Heishichiro Yoshida, there are more than 2,600 species of snakes, about one-third of which are venomous.

The southwestern provinces of China, especially western Guangdong and Hainan Island, produce more snakes. The pythons on Hainan Island are often more than ten zhang in length, with a girth of seven or eight chi, and can swallow humans, jackals, tigers, leopards, and deer. The gallbladders of these pythons are about the size of duck eggs.

In 1934, a 30-foot-long scaled python was discovered on Trinidad Island off the coast of Venezuela in South America. The local natives called this giant python "Hurra," and it could swallow a shark whole.

On March 12, 1936, a large snake more than ten zhang long, as thick as a giant urn, and covered with red and black spots was discovered in Lianyungang, China. After being discovered by farmers, they beat drums and attacked it, and the snake escaped. The appearance of such a giant snake in the north is indeed rare.

However, the fearfulness of snakes does not lie in their large size but in their venom. The Bothrops insularis snake from South America is only 1.4 meters long, but it can kill a cow in 45 minutes. In Legge Copse, India, there are venomous snakes that are 3 meters long. If a human is bitten by it, they will die within two hours. If an elephant's trunk touches its venom, it will die in just three hours. There is a type of venomous snake in Xikang Province, China, that is only one or two cun long, with bright eyes and fast crawling. It occupies the top of the mountain and establishes nests everywhere. Although the mountain is rich in medicinal materials, no one dares to collect them.

Snakes also like to kill each other. Often, giant snakes swallow small snakes, but there are also small venomous snakes that can kill giant pythons.

Snake meat can be eaten, the gallbladder can be used to make medicine, and the skin can be used to make shoes and purses, etc. It can be said that every part of the snake can be used. However, before killing and eating it, the venomous teeth must be removed. Eating snake meat is a unique hobby of the Cantonese people.

### Those Who Obey Me Shall Live, Those Who Resist Me Shall Die

— Wangu

The winds and rains, the rights and wrongs, the current situation is truly a thick fog. In the fog, there is much to be done: Some people who do not participate in the National Assembly themselves insist that those who do participate violate the will of the people, while those who act in accordance with Yan'an (that is, those who are beneficial to Yan'an) are following public opinion. Furthermore: Those who do not run with Yan'an are "betraying friends" and "changing their principles"; conversely, they are all "statesmen with dignified demeanor." A foreign reporter who came from the "Liberated Area" said it well: "Those who obey me shall live, those who resist me shall die!"

Under these circumstances, I think it would be best if China only had one party—a party that would "revolve" the proletariat's "fate"!

### Goering's Suicide Poison: Potassium Cyanide

— Mai Ye

Goering, the number one Nazi war criminal and a lover of medals during his lifetime, finally committed suicide by taking poison in his cell in Nuremberg late on the night of October 15th, two hours and fifteen minutes before his scheduled execution by hanging. Not "a general dying on the battlefield," nor brave enough to walk up the thirteen short steps to the gallows, Goering cowardly took potassium cyanide in his cell. The small glass tube containing the poison was his last "medal"—this "medal" was rumored to be hidden in his belly!

"Potassium cyanide" is a highly poisonous substance. Not long ago, Japan's number one war criminal, Fumimaro Konoe, also committed suicide by swallowing potassium cyanide in the middle of the night, right? Not only that, but last fall, another high-ranking Nazi leader committed suicide in prison by secretly taking potassium cyanide. He had prepared it long ago: hiding the poison in a fake gold tooth. The jailers conducted body searches "repeatedly," but naturally could not find it. In the end, one day, he removed the gold shell, and once the poison took effect, his "soul returned to hell" (heaven has no place for him!), and he breathed his last!

Is it "fighting poison with poison"? Those poisoned by the poisonous Nazi ideology ended their lives with deadly poison!

In ordinary chemistry laboratories, potassium cyanide is considered one of the most poisonous substances. Some people call it "green arsenic." In fact, the "arsenic" (i.e., "arsenic stone") used by Pan Jinlian to poison Wu Dalang after being instigated by Mother Wang, as described in "Jin Ping Mei," is far less potent than potassium cyanide. A sensational love affair that took place in Guilin two or three years ago: the male protagonist, Mr. Li (a chemistry professor), had an affair with a female assistant in the chemical laboratory. Later, his wife died after angrily taking poison. The man argued in court that his wife died from accidentally eating poison herself, not that he poisoned her, the most powerful proof being that she died from eating barium chloride. If he had intended to kill her, he would have used the more poisonous potassium cyanide. Both of these drugs were available in the laboratory.

Potassium cyanide is a white crystalline powder that looks similar to Taiwan No. 1 white sugar. Smelling it with your nose doesn't seem to have any odor, but if you sniff it too much, you will become dizzy and poisoned. It is unknown whether it has any taste when tasted with the tongue. Some people say it has a strange smell, but by the time a person notices that the smell is wrong, their fate is already standing on the "Yinyang Bridge" on the "Naihe River" between the human and the ghost worlds! The danger of potassium cyanide can be proven by this example: Twelve years ago, when I was studying "forensic medicine" with an old professor in Tokyo, there was a shocking potassium cyanide case in Tokyo at that time. The perpetrator was the lover of a "tea girl" (i.e., waitress) in a certain tea shop. The victim was the said mistress. The man secretly put potassium cyanide in a cup of coffee and let the woman drink it. After she drank one or two sips, the cup had not even been put back on the saucer when she fell sideways and died. The remaining poisonous coffee spilled all over her body!

The chemical formula for potassium cyanide is KCN. It has a very strong affinity for many metals. It can dissolve gold bars and silver ingots, so it has great uses in "metallurgy." The copper plates or zinc plates published in the "Shen Bao" every day also cannot do without it when shooting negatives. Iron is the hardest of all metals, and steel is even harder than iron. The hardest Japanese "wind steel" cannot do without potassium cyanide as a hardening agent during steelmaking. A piece of iron, when heated red hot, only needs to be dipped in a potassium cyanide solution, and after cooling, it will be many times harder. Potassium cyanide also has many uses in agriculture and is considered indispensable in chemical analysis.

Potassium cyanide is so poisonous because it interacts with the iron in human blood. When blood encounters it, it immediately undergoes a terrible change. According to "forensic medicine," potassium cyanide poisoning is the easiest to detect. The skin of the deceased must be a beautiful golden yellow because the potassium cyanide combines with the blood. By the way, if there is a body of a potassium cyanide poisoning victim in a well, it is best to fill the well with mud and never use it again.

When, oh when, will the blood of the likes of Franco be tainted with a little potassium cyanide!

### The Most Luxurious Hotel in the World

— Yu Qiang

Some people say: As long as you have the patience to wait at the door of the Waldorf Hotel in New York, it is not difficult to see the great figures of the world.

Since the Waldorf Hotel was built, it has become the "New York Office" of American presidents. Roosevelt and Truman both stayed there. Hoover, the only living former president of the United States who came to China this year to conduct investigations, has also booked a long-term room here.

Emperors, queens, heads of state, prime ministers, diplomats, and business tycoons from all over the world... Those who pass through New York rarely stay in any other hotel besides the Waldorf. Madame Chiang Kai-shek, De Gaulle, King George V of Greece, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands... have all been guests at the Waldorf. Now that the United Nations is "established" in New York, the Waldorf has added countless footprints of "world safety makers." The recent meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers was also held here, and the Waldorf Hotel seems to be competing with the Luxembourg Palace.

The Duke of Windsor, who "gave up the throne for love," also stayed here when he visited the United States. At that time, he made a joke: Once, he got "lost" in the Waldorf Hotel. Finally, he found the entrance to the elevator and rang the bell to call the elevator. Who knew that this elevator was for carrying goods, but the Duke of Windsor nonchalantly stepped inside. The elevator operator felt quite at a loss. The naturally uninhibited Duke of Windsor was now sitting comfortably on the cargo box. He said to the driver: "Let's go. If you don't mind, I don't mind."

Behind the Waldorf's luxury and glory, human tragedies and comedies happen every day. Men and women dance, love, divorce, and die here. Last year, MGM produced a film called "Weekend at the Waldorf" using the Waldorf as a backdrop, depicting the various aspects of this place.

The room rates at the Waldorf, although not as expensive as some people might imagine, are not cheap either. Some specially ordered and beautifully decorated suites with two to ten rooms cost $120 US per day.

The Waldorf's kitchen is world-renowned and is known as a "small international alliance." Most of the chefs, butchers, seasoning chefs, and pastry chefs are hired from various countries. The head chef is Italian, and the baker is Australian. The porcelain and silverware are managed by Portuguese, Filipinos, and Spaniards respectively.

Lucius Boomer, the guiding spirit of the Waldorf, is recognized as the most outstanding hotel management authority in the world. He manages 10,000 employees without chaos or slackness.

### "Refund!"

— Jiesheng

On the evening of the 11th, the fourth show of "Yingfei Renjian" was being performed at a certain large theater. Just as it was nearing the end, after Liu Ying was expelled by the teacher, Mr. Luther, the film suddenly went silent. The entire audience was in an uproar, but in less than a minute, it continued, and the film had sound again. The noisy audience then quieted down.

Although the "silent scene" lasted for only a minute, a psychological test was conducted during this time: After the film "went silent," those who wanted to shout first made strange noises, and then they shouted what they wanted to say, even—"Refund!" "Refund!" "Refund!"

Just before this silent scene, in the dialogue when Liu Ying was expelled by Mr. Luther, Liu Ying said this sentence: "They only have money in their eyes!" I don't know what kind of aftertaste the many audience members who shouted "Refund" will have when they think of this sentence again after shouting. I am not speaking for the theater owner, I just feel that these people like to "tease people for fun" too much, resulting in the complete disorder of public order! Accidents in public places are unavoidable, and this sudden incident is precisely a test of the public's spirit of maintaining order!

### Tit for Tat

— Ge Chunliang

Rubber Nails

A reckless and conceited playwright, when his own play was about to be staged, sent two tickets for the first night of the performance to the mayor. He attached a note saying that the mayor could invite a friend, saying in the letter: "If you happen to still have a friend, you can invite him."

The mayor returned the two tickets with a very humble letter, saying that he already had an appointment, so it was impossible to come to the theater on the first night of the performance, but he wanted to buy two tickets for the second night, "If that play can still be performed."

A Child's Thoughts

A mother taught her young son, saying: "We should help others when we live in the world." He considered this sentence for a long time, and then asked: "Then what do others live in the world for?"

Not Without Insight

During the Bikini Atoll atomic bomb tests, everyone was arguing about what weapons would be used in the next war—atomic bombs, microbes, or rockets.

"I don't know what weapons will be used in the next war," said a young army adjutant, "But in the war after the next war, for sure, they will have to go back to using stone spears from the Stone Age as weapons."

Giving as Good as One Gets

A fisherman who made a living by fishing was famous for being good at telling jokes. One day, a fat widow happened to pass by there, and shouted to him: "Hey, boatman, people tell me that you are a very famous 'liar' here."

The fisherman said humbly: "Madam, you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my life." (Editor's note: Please note: the word "beautiful" here comes from a "liar.") (Translated from the November Reader's Digest)

### Rose Wine and Overcoat

— Jianhua

Shanghai Cross-Section

This extremely interesting scam unfolded like this:

My friend Mr. Chen lives in Xiangfen Lane, Tianjin Road, and is currently a teacher at a middle school on Liuhe Road. The two places are not far apart. Mr. Chen must go to school from Xizang Road every morning and return home the same way in the evening. He is familiar with the route and travels back and forth like this every day.

Last Friday, when Mr. Chen returned home after class, he saw that the newly made overcoat that was hanging in the bedroom was gone. He asked his wife, who was preparing dinner. Mr. Chen's wife said in surprise after her husband's inquiry: "That's strange! The overcoat was taken away by a school worker, who said that you were afraid of the cold in the evening and specially sent him to take it away; and he brought back two bottles of white rose wine, saying that you were inviting guests tomorrow and bought what you needed in advance. Look! Aren't those two bottles of white rose wine on the table?"

After hearing what his wife said, Mr. Chen knew that he had been deceived. He realized that this overcoat, which he had worn twice when it suddenly got cold at the beginning of the month, must have been noticed by the scammer on the road, who had followed and discovered his address, pretending to be a school worker to commit fraud. As for the white rose wine that was brought, it was to make the family believe that he was a school worker, serving as bait. The broad-minded Mr. Chen, thinking of this, couldn't help but laugh and said to his wife: "We must not disappoint the scammer's good intentions. Now that we have good wine, tomorrow please prepare some dishes and invite two or three close friends to our home for a small drink. Wouldn't that be fun?"

At six o'clock, Mr. Chen went to school and said to his colleagues: "I am honored to have been the victim of a theft, and I have prepared some wine. Please join me for a simple meal tonight. Please don't thank me." The colleagues were baffled and thought it was a joke until Mr. Chen told them about the scam, which aroused a lot of laughter.

After four o'clock, Mr. Chen forcibly pulled a few friends and went home together for a small drink. Mr. Chen's wife opened the door to welcome them and said: "Now that the scam has been exposed, did you bring back the overcoat?" This sudden question caught Mr. Chen off guard. Mr. Chen's wife said anxiously: "Around one o'clock this afternoon, a man in uniform came, claiming to have been sent by the ×× branch office, saying that the scammer had been caught, but he needed to take back the exhibit, the white rose wine, for strict investigation, so he handed over the wine to the person." Before Mr. Chen's wife finished speaking, the colleagues burst into laughter.

For the sake of an overcoat, there would be repeated scams, as if joking. Even the discerning and capable Mrs. Chen would be unable to see through the maze at the time and be deceived, which is truly a unique aspect of scams.
