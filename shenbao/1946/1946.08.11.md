### Joint Statement by General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart Elaborates on the Core Issues of the Current Situation; Agreement Difficult to Reach Between the Government and the CCP

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 10th] Special Envoy Marshall invited Ambassador Stuart and Zhou Enlai to his residence at 10:30 AM today for discussions, continuing to exchange views on key issues. Zhou Enlai also indicated his rejection of Chairman Chiang's proposals. It is understood that Chairman Chiang's proposals require the Communist forces to withdraw from five areas—northern Jiangsu, Rehe, the Jiaoji Railway, Shanxi, and the Northeast—and relinquish their local administrative authority. Zhou Enlai returned to Meiyuan New Village at 12:30 PM. Ambassador Stuart remained at the residence, having lunch with General Marshall, and they decided to issue a written statement in the afternoon. At 5:15 PM, Yu Da-wei visited General Marshall, engaging in conversation for an hour before departing at 6:15 PM. It is also reported that Ambassador Stuart will travel to Beiping next week to attend to university affairs at Yenching University.

[Our Guling Bureau, 10th] It is rumored that Marshall is ill and will come here from Nanjing tomorrow.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The United States Information Service released a statement by US Special Envoy to China, General Marshall, and Ambassador to China, Stuart, regarding the current situation in China, as follows: "General Marshall and Dr. Stuart have been jointly exploring various possible ways to end the increasingly widespread conflict in China and begin the initial steps towards developing a truly democratic government. A peaceful resolution of all political problems is, in fact, the unanimous desire of all Chinese people. Regarding the economic situation, a political solution must be sought immediately to avoid a disastrous collapse. The scope of the war is expanding, threatening to engulf the entire country in warfare beyond the control of those responsible. Leaders on both sides of the government and the Communist Party desire to end the war, but certain problems awaiting resolution have thus far made agreement difficult to reach. Both sides seem unable to find a method for resolving these issues, thereby enabling the issuance of a nationwide ceasefire order. Among these unresolved problems, some relate to the redeployment of troops. However, a more fundamental question remains: after the redeployment of troops, what should be the nature of the local governments in these evacuated areas before the National Assembly makes fundamental decisions? This question is more difficult to resolve than the redeployment of troops."

Military Reorganization and Garrison Area Issues – CCP Has Shown No Sincerity to Date (Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th) After General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart issued their statement, a reporter interviewed an observer to solicit their opinion. According to the observer, "The statement by General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart explains the general situation and the results of their efforts and consultations over the past month, making it clear to the public where the crux of the current situation lies. We deeply admire the hard work and sincerity of the two gentlemen. The last paragraph, concerning the difficulty of military reorganization and garrison locations, as well as the CCP's demand to retain its civil administrative organs after withdrawing troops from certain areas in the future, highlights truly important issues. The CCP's demands may seem superficially reasonable, but a careful analysis reveals their insincerity and complete focus on propaganda. This is obvious. In Europe and America, it is common for the central government to be governed by one party while local governments have governors and mayors from the opposition party. It was not uncommon for communist mayors to be elected in some cities in France before the war, even when the right-wing party was in power. This did not cause major obstacles, because these opposition party local officials still had to abide by national laws and could not make any major changes at will. However, the CCP is different. Wherever its regime reaches, it expels and slaughters local merchants, landlords, and intellectuals, abolishes all national laws, withholds all tax revenues, and independently issues currency and establishes its own army, essentially forming a completely separate country and undertaking a political and social revolution. If this kind of local government is established everywhere, China will have countless independent countries completely opposed to the central government. Is this the way to peaceful unification? If so, what is the point of discussing peace? Therefore, we must express this point to draw the attention of Chinese and foreign individuals."

A Hopeless Game; A Pessimistic Premonition Pervades Nanjing

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 10th] After the statement by General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart was released this afternoon, the Nationalist side also declined to comment. It is reported that Zhou Enlai stated that the current situation will be more serious than this statement indicates. According to a foreign authority, the negotiations between the Nationalists and the Communists are like a game of chess where all the pieces have been captured, leaving only cannons and generals on each side. Although this game is not yet a checkmate, there is no way to move forward. According to someone close to the government, "We are deeply grateful for the hard work and efforts of the Stuart and Marshall in striving for peace. We hope they will not be discouraged. However, we will still rely on our own efforts to achieve peace." Today is the anniversary of the victory in the War of Resistance. At this time last year, there was an irrepressible celebration in the wartime capital. This year, the peace negotiations have been declared suspended, and a sense of pessimism pervades the city. Is this not an ominous sign?

[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] After Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart issued their joint statement, many observers here believe that Marshall has discovered that his mission cannot be completed. However, no news has emerged from Marshall's residence indicating that Marshall will abandon his arduous task. It is generally believed that Marshall is now convinced that, given the current state of negotiations between the two sides, peace is unlikely to be achieved. It is currently unknown what consequences the joint statement will bring about.

### Chairman's Important Announcement to Be Released on the 14th; Minister Peng Announced in Shanghai Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] Minister of Information Peng Xuepei announced yesterday (the 10th) at a cocktail reception for the local press that Chairman Chiang will release an important announcement on August 14th. Minister Peng, who had just arrived in Shanghai on the 9th, held a cocktail reception for leaders of the press at the Cathay Hotel on the 8th floor at 5 PM yesterday (the eve of the first anniversary of Japan's surrender) to foster camaraderie. Approximately 150 people attended, including presidents, editors-in-chief of local Chinese and foreign newspapers and news agencies, heads of the press offices of major embassies in Shanghai, and directors of news distribution for agencies such as the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Guests and hosts mingled on the high floor, chatting happily with drinks in hand. The aforementioned important news was announced by Peng at the reception, first in Chinese and then in English. He stated: "The Chairman is scheduled to release an important announcement on the 14th, the content of which will broadly cover: (1) a review of the government's governance in the year since the victory, (2) the current situation, and (3) fiscal and economic policies." Minister Peng continued: "Our financial situation is now gradually improving. The amount of banknotes issued in July did not increase, which is the first time since the war. Tax revenue is steadily increasing, and in recent months, the sale of enemy and puppet properties has generated 30 billion yuan per month for the national treasury. The China Textile Corporation also contributes a net profit of 10 billion yuan to the national treasury each month." Minister Peng had inspected Jiangxi, Hunan, and Sichuan, and all provinces had abundant harvests. Therefore, Minister Peng concluded: "Grain prices in all regions are expected to fall in the future, and production costs can therefore be expected to decrease. However, the biggest difficulty currently lies in the lack of coal. Although the economy and finance have improved, a solution cannot be found because the coal mines in Shandong and other places are still in the hands of the Communist Party. Shanghai currently needs 500,000 tons of coal, relying on the Kailuan Coal Mine to supply 140,000 tons per month and Taiwan to ship 60,000 tons, which is still far from enough. We only hope that the Communist Party can lift the blockade so that our financial and economic situation can improve further." At around 6 PM, Chinese and foreign guests shook hands with Minister Peng to say goodbye and expressed their gratitude for the hospitality.

### Wu Dingchang Arrives in Guling; Zhou Zhirou Returns to Nanjing Yesterday

[Our Guling Bureau, 10th] Secretary-General Wu Dingchang of the National Government arrived in Guling at 3:20 PM on the 10th. When asked by reporters about the purpose of his visit, Wu stated that he was summoned by the Chairman and was also responding to the request of the Shanghai business community to address the industrial and commercial crisis.

[Our Guling Bureau, 10th] Chiang Ching-kuo, the Director of Education, arrived in Guling from Nanjing at 4 PM on the 10th, residing at No. 58 Yanghe East Road. Chiang did not use a sedan chair to ascend the mountain, walking the entire way. After a short rest, he was summoned by the Chairman.

[Our Guling Bureau, 10th] Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force Zhou Zhirou came to Guling again on the afternoon of the 9th, met with Chairman Chiang at 8 AM on the 10th to bid farewell, and left Guling for Nanjing at 9 AM.

### Grand Reception at the U.S. Embassy in Nanjing to Celebrate Stuart's New Appointment

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The U.S. Embassy hosted a reception this afternoon at 6:30 PM, serving refreshing orange juice cocktails to Chinese and foreign guests to celebrate Dr. Stuart's new appointment. The Ambassador, dressed in a white suit and black bow tie, looked relaxed. The Ambassador himself and the hosts of the reception, the embassy's Counselor Bader and his wife, diligently mingled with the guests. Some guests discussed the statement on the current situation by the Ambassador and General Marshall, but it did not make the atmosphere on the lawn solemn. General Marshall, Yu Da-wei, Zhou Enlai, and others also chatted and laughed. Other guests included Shao Lizi, Chong Xu Kan, Gan Naiguang, Jiang Menglin, Deng Yingchao, and over a hundred envoys from various countries to China.

### External Communication Limited to Within a Hundred Li; Taiyuan Has Become an Isolated City; Communist Forces Increase Troops and Deploy Defenses Around Baoding

[Our Tianjin Bureau, 10th] Taiyuan has become an isolated city, with external communication difficult beyond a hundred li. It only reaches Yuci, 60 li to the east, Jinzhong, 50 li to the west, Huangzhai, 69 li to the north, and Jiexiu, in the south. Currently, only China National Aviation Corporation aircraft maintain traffic to Beiping. Fighting is still intense along the Zhengtai Railway, and the railway has been severely damaged by Communist forces.

[Our Tianjin Bureau, 10th] Communist forces have increased troops around Baoding. The commander of their First Military District, Yin Tang, has led his troops to deploy defenses southwest of Mancheng. The 31st Brigade, led by Qian Ning, has moved from Shengfang to the northwest of Gaoyang to construct fortifications. Fighting broke out in Zhuoxian on the 9th. Huayuan Xiaobu Village was fiercely attacked by over a thousand troops from Yang Chengwu's Communist forces, and fierce fighting is underway.

### Communist Forces Collapsing on Various Lines in Northern Jiangsu; Nationalist Forces Advance Northward Across Dongtai; Communist Base in Huaiyin Shaken

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 10th] On the 5th of this month, Nationalist forces on the right wing of Northern Jiangsu entered Fuan from Wangjiazhuang, Hai'an. The next day, taking advantage of the momentum, they broke through key positions such as Anfeng, Liangdu, and Sanzhao along the highway at a speed of ten li per hour, attacking into the south gate of Dongtai. Another force occupied Xixi, two li west of Chetai. Communist forces began to retreat northward. Nationalist forces are now advancing northwards in two routes. One route is heading towards Jiancheng along the highway, and the other is advancing westwards along the Bengting River, joining forces with the Nationalist forces at Dadu and Laoge, gradually clearing out the Communist forces west of Dongtai. Then, they will combine forces and head straight for Linze, taking Sisui, cutting off the Huai'an-Xianshui highway and the canal, trapping the Communist forces at Jieshou, Gaoyou, and Shaobo in isolation. The Nationalist forces' strategy is to avoid direct contact with the main force of the Communist forces. Therefore, the Nationalist forces at Xiannv Temple are holding back, waiting for the Nationalist forces in Taixian to encircle northward from Sanlangmiao towards the west, encircling the rear of the Communist forces, and then eliminating the Communist forces south of Sisui in one fell swoop.

The Nationalist forces' northern route in Xuzhou has reached Hanzhuang and is advancing rapidly towards Shagou. The eastern route still controls Bayiji. A train from eastern Xuzhou can now reach Daxujia Station. The Nationalist forces in Shuanggou have been fiercely attacked by Communist forces for days but have not budged. Over ten thousand Communist forces north of the Bulao River are currently gathering in the Dongfushan area, showing signs of an offensive. The situation is tense in the area west of Taierzhuang. Both sides have suffered heavy casualties. It is rumored that Luo Rongheng, Commander-in-Chief of the Communist forces' Linyi Military District, Ma Zhanrong, Commander of the Security Forces, and Zheng Tingjun, Deputy Commander, have all arrived near Chefushan to launch a large-scale offensive. The Nationalist forces in Yongcheng have repelled the attacking Communist forces. The Nationalist forces in Dangshan have not yet escaped the dangerous situation. The Communist forces in Fengxian, Shanxian, Xiayi, and Tangzhai are constantly increasing. Fierce fighting has occurred in the area west of Huangkou Station. The Communist forces' offensive this time is clearly a losing proposition. The Communist base in Huaiyin is showing signs of shaking. It is rumored that the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Government has now retreated to Huaiyin, and the Zhangji Huazhong Bank has moved to Huai'an Yanzhi. Communist organs in Binying have also moved to Daguanzhuang. Therefore, the clearing out of the Communist forces in Northern Jiangsu is only a matter of time.

[Our Jiangdu Bureau, 10th] Military News: (1) Communist forces in Gaoyou have recently received 15,000 reinforcements from southern Shandong, attempting to attack the Yangtian Highway again. It is reported that fierce fighting has broken out near Lingtangqiao. (2) Nationalist forces are stepping up their efforts to encourage defections. In recent days, many Communist soldiers from various places have surrendered and reformed.

### Fierce Fighting on the Outskirts of Xianghe; UNRRA Agricultural Expert Shot Again

[Our Beiping Bureau, 10th] It is now confirmed that Xianghe is still in the hands of the Communist forces. It is now learned that the Communist forces have amassed 50,000 troops in the area, preparing for a large-scale decisive battle. At the same time, the Communist side is propagating that the Nationalist forces are also preparing. Currently, there is fierce fighting at various strongholds on the outskirts of Xianghe. Yesterday, the Communist forces even used mustard gas shells, and a group of Nationalist soldiers were poisoned and are waiting to die.

[United Press, Tianjin, 10th] It was learned today that UNRRA and China Relief Administration agricultural expert Di Yu and his translator Wu Yuehan were ambushed on the Pingjin Road in an UNRRA Jeep this morning. The incident occurred about 30 li from Tianjin. First, a plainclothes Chinese man fired a shot, followed by about 40 people in blue-gray Communist military uniforms who rushed out of the wheat field and stood on the side of the road, all firing. Although Di's car was hit in many places, the two were fortunately unharmed. Di and his translator had returned from the Rehe Communist area and had discussed the restoration of agriculture in Rehe with Communist leaders while in Rehe.

[Our Beiping Bureau, 10th] The 25-member team responsible for investigating the Anping incident held and adjourned a meeting today amidst much noise and commotion. The meeting began at 9 AM in room K31 of the Xiehe Hospital. The representatives of the Marine Corps, who have been waiting in Beiping for three or four days to report to the Executive Headquarters, arrived on time and stood in the corridor outside the room. Chairman Davis repeated his old arguments, proposing to listen to the report of the Marine Corps. Communist representative Huang Yifeng also firmly opposed this proposal, as always. As the meeting progressed, Davis said sadly, "Six days have passed very easily, and we have only done a small part of the work we should have done. Now the three committee members also want to know what we have done. We should review what we have done in the last six days and give them a report. Now I have made such a report. If you agree, you can sign it as a joint report. If you don't agree, you can make a separate report." Huang Yifeng agreed with this proposal but added additional explanations. From this point on, there was a storm of debate, dragging the discussion topic to speaking procedures and speaking rights, and there was constant noise and commotion. At 10 AM, an angry Colonel Davis grabbed his briefcase and announced the adjournment. The three committee members of the Executive Headquarters held a meeting in the afternoon, which broke the deadlock and ordered the team to reconvene on the 11th. However, the team members also felt at a loss as to when the team would depart for the investigation.

### Lushan Summer Camp Ends on the 23rd; Chairman Visited Camp Yesterday to Watch a Play

[Our Guling Bureau, 10th] Chairman Chiang personally visited the summer camp on the evening of the 10th to watch a play, which was "San Niang Teaches Her Son."

### Communist Troops in Hubei Surrender One After Another; Local Governments Have Done Their Best to Accommodate Them

[Our Hankou Bureau, 10th] According to the military's announcement at 2 AM this morning, the number of Communist regular troops and local armed forces and their party and government workers who have surrendered with their weapons has been increasing daily.

All of them are being accommodated by the local governments as much as possible.

### CCP Continues to Propagandize Anti-Americanism; Hopes for International Interference in China; U.S. Military Aid to China Bill Is Stalled

[Our Beiping Bureau, 9th] After the Beiping Garrison Headquarters sent troops to guard the safety of the Pingjin Highway, the CCP greatly propagandized that the Nationalist forces were attacking the "Eastern Hebei Liberated Area," even claiming that the U.S. military was constantly reinforcing the Nationalist forces, attempting to divert attention and cover up the Anping incident. Furthermore, the Yan'an Liberation Daily's editorial on the 5th of this month stated that the U.S. military's continued presence in China was originally a pretext for assisting China in repatriating Japanese prisoners of war. This pretext no longer exists. If the U.S. military does not withdraw at this time, it will be similar to the "occupation forces" stationed in Japan under the command of General MacArthur. The CCP's propaganda clearly intends to use the words "occupation forces" to arouse the resentment of ignorant peasants and lay the groundwork for expanding the anti-American movement.

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 9th] Recently, the theory of international interference has been vaguely circulating, and the source is unknown. After Wang Bingnan, the CCP spokesperson, made a statement on the evening of the 7th, the public suddenly understood. The main points of Wang's statement, in addition to exaggerating the seriousness of the current situation, stated that the CCP believes that the three major powers of Britain, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union should "guarantee China's peace and democratic politics" in accordance with the Moscow Communiqué. It is morally responsible for monitoring the United States to faithfully implement the terms of the communiqué. The current state of affairs is the final test of whether the United States will conduct mediation in accordance with the principles established in Moscow and Washington. It can be seen that Wang Bingnan represents the CCP in hoping that the Soviet Union and Britain will intervene in Chinese affairs.

[Our Special Correspondent, Washington, 9th] A Chinese reporter recently met with U.S. Representative Judd. It was reported that the current "civil war" in China has caused considerable "setbacks" to the bill to provide military aid to China and send a military delegation to China. He also stated that if China does have the possibility of reorganizing the government and implementing the unified compilation of the Nationalist and Communist forces, then the bill will undoubtedly be passed, but at present, the opportunity has been lost. Judd also said that the bill did not clearly stipulate whether military aid to China would be granted before or after the establishment of a reorganized government in China, and the wording was unclear, so that even members who were extremely friendly to China expressed indifference to the bill. Currently, the bill is shelved in the House Rules Committee before Congress adjourns.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 10th] The CCP spokesperson in Beiping issued a strong statement tonight, demanding that the U.S. government withdraw all Lend-Lease aircraft, parts, and munitions previously transferred to the Chinese government. The spokesperson said that the CCP delegation in Nanjing has asked General Marshall to forward this protest to the U.S. government.

Eight breaches dug in the dike of a tributary of the Grand Canal, north of Suyong and north of Susong in northern Jiangsu, by Communist troops. Two sections of railway near Zhaodun have been destroyed.

### Landmine Explosion North of Loutai: Coal Train Derails on the Beining Railway; Guarding U.S. Troops Subsequently Attacked

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 10th] According to an announcement by the U.S. Marine Corps Headquarters here: At 11:30 PM on the 9th, a coal train on the Beining Line, heading from Guye to Tanggu, was traveling three kilometers north of Loutai when it was struck by three landmines. Eight of the train's twenty-five cars derailed, four of which were destroyed. Loutai is located sixty miles northwest of Tianjin. Following the explosion, approximately fifty Chinese armed personnel immediately opened fire on the train. The four U.S. Marine guards returned fire. It is reported that two Chinese individuals may have been injured, while the U.S. Marines were unharmed. The Marine unit proceeded to Loutai and joined a patrol of eighty men, returning to Tanggu on the morning of the 10th. According to an aerial reconnaissance report this morning, the locomotive and eight coal cars had derailed, with approximately thirty feet of track destroyed. Repair work has not yet commenced, but the railway bureau began work on the afternoon of the 10th. Train service to Qinhuangdao was suspended on the 10th.

[United Press, Beiping, 10th] Observers here believe that those who fired upon the train near Loutai were undoubtedly Communist troops. Following the Anping incident, senior government officials warned the U.S. side to be wary of further attacks by Communist troops on U.S. forces in North China. It is alleged that the Anping incident and the previous detention of soldiers were part of a planned Communist campaign to force the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China, and that this campaign is only just beginning.

### French Troops in Vietnam Commit Repeated Atrocities; We Lodge a Serious Protest; Emergency Measures Taken Regarding the Case of a Taiwanese Compatriot Shot by Japanese Police

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] When this reporter inquired with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson about the truth of the French army's massacre of our compatriots in Vietnam, he stated that according to a report from the Consulate General in Saigon: In Tan Huong City, Ben Tre Province, Cochinchina, Vietnam, on July 21st, sixty to seventy French soldiers shelled the city and then entered, searching house by house. Twenty-one compatriots were beaten, three were injured, and five went missing. The city was burned in various places, and the property losses of the compatriots are inestimable. Our Consulate General in Saigon has lodged a serious protest with the French High Commissioner in Vietnam, demanding punishment for the perpetrators and compensation for the losses. They also demanded a guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. Furthermore, on the evening of the 10th of last month, at 9:00 PM, more than one hundred French soldiers surrounded shops in Quan Tho Village, six kilometers from Saigon, drove out residents, and set fire to their homes. Thirteen businesses, including Chinese leather factories, were burned, and forty-three Chinese were detained and released the next day. One Chinese woman was severely injured. On the morning of the 13th, at 9:45 AM, French troops again went to the village and opened fire indiscriminately, killing three passersby, two of whom were Chinese. The Chinese government is extremely shocked by the French army's atrocities and has lodged a serious protest with the French Embassy, requesting that the French Ambassador immediately cable the French authorities in Vietnam to stop such behavior, investigate responsibility, and severely punish the perpetrators. Our government also reserves the right to claim compensation for loss of life and property.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] He Fengshan, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, held a press conference at noon today to explain the truth about the case of a Taiwanese compatriot shot by Japanese police in Tokyo. Mr. He first reported on the Qiantani incident (details omitted), and then stated: After receiving the report, this Ministry immediately instructed the delegation in Japan to take the following emergency measures: (1) The delegation should conduct a joint investigation with the Allied Headquarters to clarify the truth of the situation; (2) Once the incident is investigated and reported, our demands will be made; (3) Take appropriate measures to prevent the situation from spreading and escalating, and to protect the safety of compatriots; (4) Please instruct the Allied Headquarters that the Japanese government and public opinion should not deliberately exaggerate or make inflammatory propaganda. This case is still under active negotiation by our side. As for the previous report that the Taiwanese compatriot had admitted to firing at the Japanese police, it was due to an error in the secondary translation by the U.S. Military Police Headquarters in Japan, which has been corrected by the U.S. side.

### Increasing Number of Refugees in Jinan Eagerly Await Relief

[This Newspaper, Jinan, September 9th] The number of refugees in Jinan remains high, most relying on relatives and friends, causing their relatives and friends to also become refugees. There are many unemployed veterans who cannot be resettled. The refugees are eagerly awaiting Mr. Gu Zhengcheng's visit to Jinan to petition him for temporary and permanent relief. The collection of grain taxes in kind is an unbearable burden for the people of Shandong Province and is extremely difficult to implement. It is unlikely to be effective. The people hope for a delay in the collection to alleviate their suffering. Due to the inability to transport relief materials, the work of the Post-War Relief Administration is difficult to carry out, and it has ordered a reduction of one-fifth of its Jinan staff.

On July 27th, at 3:30 PM, while leading personnel by car to the Dongfang Hydropower Plant, 30 kilometers from Beili, they were suddenly ambushed by over two hundred bandits in the Xiningpo area. Mr. He, along with driver Qiu Quan, Huang Zirong, and five mine police officers, were killed on the spot. Six mine police officers and one worker were seriously injured, and Captain Wang Xipan and one mine police officer were slightly injured. It is noted that Mr. He was a native of Panyu, Guangdong, 33 years old, and a graduate of Fudan University. In October of last year, he was dispatched to work in the Shilubingqiao area of Hainan Island and was surrounded by over six hundred bandits. After a fierce battle lasting an hour, he managed to break through the encirclement. Unfortunately, this time he was killed.

In the areas of Yin Fang Hang and Shaxin Dam along the western tributaries of the Xijian River in Guanyun County, northern Jiangsu, more than 122 river dikes were dug by the Communist forces. Wherever the water flowed, the trees were submerged, and the villages were floating in the water, a tragic situation.

### The Industrial and Commercial Sectors Cry for Help!

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Industries, due to the severe crisis currently facing industry and commerce, have drafted a rescue plan and sent representatives to Beijing on the evening of the 8th to petition. Those industries suffering the most have also dispatched additional representatives to accompany them. It is reported that chambers of commerce in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, Wuxi, and other places, feeling the same plight, are responding in kind. This action clearly demonstrates that the industrial and commercial sectors are crying for help, which carries a very profound significance. Although the results of their petition in the capital these past two days are not yet known, we believe that this petition must succeed and not fail; furthermore, Premier Song met with leaders of the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors in Shanghai the day before yesterday to listen to their concerns, and we can trust that the government will not allow this petition by the industrial and commercial sectors to fail.

Now, we wish to speak a few words to the government and the industrial and commercial sectors from the position of journalists. First and foremost, it must be pointed out that the crisis in industry and commerce is already here, not a prediction. Just look at the sluggish sales in all industries and the endless closures of factories and shops, and it is an ironclad fact. Moreover, this situation is not limited to Shanghai alone. There are naturally many reasons for this, and there is no need to elaborate here. However, the failure of government-run financial institutions to coordinate with productive enterprises, and the comprador-minded foreign exchange and trade policies failing to stabilize the national economy, are the two most important primary causes.

We know that the Four Banks Joint Treasury, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank, etc., have all achieved considerable results. However, their achievements are merely their own achievements, merely the achievements of their own operating surpluses, not the achievements of industry and commerce in general, let alone the achievements of national economic development. Regarding the so-called support for industry and commerce, and the development of production, etc., whether they can truly fulfill their mission remains doubtful to the outside world. For example, loan policies have recently become tightened, and business procedures have become exceptionally complicated. In considering the safeguarding of their own stability, there is naturally nothing to criticize. However, when it comes to the tasks of regulating finance and supporting production, whether they have been fully utilized to a satisfactory degree seems to be another question.

Taking industrial loans as an example, it seems that quite a few loans have indeed been issued after various urging. However, the total amount, it is said, is still less than two percent of the total annual expenditure. Taking private banks as an example, we only hear of "increasing reserve requirements" and "restricting loans," etc. As for promoting the flexibility of the financial market, are there any active measures? The facts are evident, and it seems unnecessary for us to dwell on them further.

The exchange rate against the US dollar has long been fixed, approximately six to seven hundred times higher than before the war. However, the domestic price index has risen to four to five thousand times. Even if the US price level is calculated according to the black market, it has only increased three to four times. Is this approach hindering exports and encouraging imports? Major export goods such as silk, tea, and tung oil still cannot recover. On the import side, luxury goods and essential goods are treated equally in terms of foreign exchange settlement. Among essential goods, such as machinery, even three-month drafts are insufficient to cope with the situation, and they are instead hit hard and unable to place orders. As a result, a large amount of foreign exchange funds flow to luxury goods and foreign surplus goods as collateral.

We also know that certain types of imported goods were originally subject to an additional 50% luxury tax, and that certain types were prohibited from import. However, the additional 50% surcharge, in reality, does not affect the profits of foreign exporters, and the so-called prohibited imports are only a meager twenty-odd items. Apart from these twenty-odd items, it seems that there are still many, many things that China does not need at present, especially in post-war China. If international trade is still regarded as the last barrier to international lending, and if it is believed that the domestic economy is too weak to serve as a drain for foreign goods, then it seems that the rationality of this approach is still open for discussion.

The above two policies (financial policy and foreign exchange and trade policy) clearly still have errors. It must be understood that focusing only on banknotes and neglecting the overall economy, thus tightening loans to productive enterprises, is truly a one-sided view. As for foreign exchange and international trade, the practice of extending foreign exchange payments for fear of increased banknote payouts, and considering the cheap import of foreign goods as a way to promote the withdrawal of legal tender by selling them at higher prices, we also believe that the soundness of this shopkeeper-like argument needs to be re-examined. Because the tighter the finances, the weaker production will be; the more foreign goods, the more difficult the economy will be. Is there a country in the world that can afford to not engage in production themselves and rely solely on foreign goods for their entire lives?

Secondly, we must also hope that the industrial and commercial sectors will rise up and save themselves. There are too many crises currently facing industry and commerce, apart from the few mentioned above. The problems of local order, transportation, and power, etc., are all things that cannot be solved by self-reliance alone. As for how to adjust production equipment, how to reduce labor-management disputes, and even improve management and expand sales, people in the industry cannot shirk their responsibility and should at least bear the majority of the responsibility. Therefore, in our opinion, those with outdated machinery, poor quality products, and product costs higher than the general level, may as well be strictly eliminated, and should no longer be allowed to waste financial resources and resources. As for those with more favorable production conditions and capable of sustaining themselves, they should seek practical connections with financial institutions and engage in production actively with a spirit of hard work and perseverance. For workers with poor skills, efforts should be made to improve them; the relief of unemployed workers should be the responsibility of the state, and the productive enterprise of the factory should not be regarded as a charitable relief undertaking. Only then can people in the industry concentrate their labor compensation on diligent workers. If handled in this way, the industrial sector may still have a glimmer of hope. As for the commercial sector, in recent years, its abnormal development has failed to coordinate with industrial products and consumer purchasing power. In addition to adjusting finances to avoid being hit by a complete collapse, it seems that they should also have a thorough awakening and consider merging with each other to save labor costs.

Finally, we must not forget the farmers who account for more than 80% of the national population. They are the suppliers of raw materials and also the consumers of products. Therefore, revitalizing the countryside and increasing their economic capacity is the most fundamental and important plan. Although the Farmers Bank of China is working very hard at present, in the eyes of ordinary farmers, it still feels like a drop in the bucket. Coupled with the too-short loan terms, the too-great attraction of foreign goods, the large-scale import of American cotton, and the large-scale dumping of foreign wheat, farmers' confidence in planting cotton and wheat has been further cooled. The root cause of the problem is still due to the authorities' too-shortsighted vision, too-small calculations, and the improper handling of financial policy and foreign exchange and trade policy.

The situation is truly urgent! The national economic crisis is becoming more and more apparent day by day! The industrial and commercial sectors have reached the point where "when people are poor, they call on heaven," and everyone is forced to cry out to the government for help! If we only know how to follow the old path of "comprador policy" and plan to recover banknotes by dumping foreign goods, I am afraid that one day we will reach "national poverty and exhausted wealth," and how can the government be stable? If we do not quickly "mend the fold after the sheep is lost" now, we will inevitably "gnaw at our navels too late" in the future!

Local Dispatches

Wuxi

Confiscation of Traitorous Property Already Decided

On the 6th of this month, the Shanghai Songhu Garrison Command executed twenty-six traitors from the Anti-Japanese War period at the Song Park Road execution ground. Among them were three people from Wuxi: Dong Huimin, Guo Bingyan, and Ren Zhenglei. It is learned that after hearing the news, the families of Dong and the others rushed to Shanghai to re-coffin and enshroud the bodies. Ren's wife, Lin Lanzhen, a young woman from the Zhuangyuanlou Restaurant, returned to Wuxi yesterday with disheveled hair and a dirty face, wearing a short black Xiangyunsha cheongsam, tied with a white waistband, a face full of tears, carrying two young children, and mentally disturbed, wandering by the park pond, intending to jump into the pond to commit suicide. Ren's shares in the Taihe Tobacco Company have been seized by the enemy property disposal bureau. In addition, the Dalai Department Store on Tongyun Road, which was opened by Guo Bingyan, was also sealed up on the 8th. However, Guo's younger brother, Guo Bingquan, came forward to defend himself and provide evidence, requesting exemption from the seal.

Changzhou

Rushing to Repair the Entire Wujin Highway

The Wujin County Government previously received an order from the First Pacification Zone Headquarters to repair the highway between Ximen Huaide Bridge and the airfield. It has dispatched personnel to conduct on-site inspections of the original road and ordered the Nan'yunzhen in the First District and the Haitang and Chendu townships in the Second District to repair sections, carrying crushed bricks and tiles to fill and flatten the uneven areas of the original road surface. They have been rushing to build it in recent days. Due to the scorching weather and the lack of materials, several small sections have not yet been completed. County Magistrate Sun personally inspected the route on the 8th, strictly ordering the responsible townships to complete it within a deadline. However, according to the plan of the engineers, the emergency repair is only temporary and difficult to last for a long time. The fundamental solution is to overturn the entire old roadbed, pave it with marble, pour slurry, press it flat, and then cover it with coal slag and yellow sand, otherwise it will be useless. However, the county government cannot afford this project, so it has telegraphed the Provincial Highway Administration, requesting that a road maintenance office be established in Changzhou as soon as possible to be responsible for the cultivation and repair. The provincial government believes that the establishment of the Changzhou Road Maintenance Office cannot be delayed due to the tense military situation in northern Jiangsu. It has instructed the county government to approve it immediately. The Road Maintenance Office will purchase and allocate materials, and the county will requisition civilian laborers to rush to repair the entire Wu (jin) Jin (tan) highway, with a deadline for completion. After the Road Maintenance Office is established in the coming days, it is expected that the materials will be allocated successively and can be implemented. The county government has recently reported the above situation to Commander Li Moan of the Pacification Department for verification.

Jiangyin

Relief for Refugees, Rice Collection Campaign

Since the outbreak of the war in northern Jiangsu, refugees have been crossing the river south in an endless stream. Apart from a small number who have sought refuge with relatives and friends and found other ways to live, those who cannot make a living have reached four to five hundred people. Recently, as they are running out of food and becoming starving, the city district director, Han Guozhang, initiated a campaign to have residents of each town in the city district donate one liter of rice per household. The Jia head is responsible for collecting the rice. Those who cannot afford it are exempt, and those who are happy to donate more are welcome. The towns will be responsible for preserving the collected rice and reporting it to the county government, notifying the person in charge of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Association to prepare documents and receive it.

Nantong

Construction Office Dispatches Personnel to Supervise Highway Repair

The Provincial Construction Office dispatched inspectors Wu Shuyuan and Shen Anzuo to the county to supervise the repair of the Tongru Highway. On the 6th, they accompanied Section Chief Wei of the county government to inspect the highways in the second and third districts of Tangzha, Pingchao, and Baipu. They departed at 10:00 AM and convened a meeting of township heads at the Second District Office to discuss the repair of the Zha Port, Cheng Port, and Tianyun Highway sections of the Tongru Road, as well as the emergency repair of the Pingchao, Xinba, and Jiuhuashan highways. At 3:00 PM, they went to Baipu to attend a meeting of township heads at the Third District Office. There was a detailed discussion on the emergency repair of bridges. Inspector Wu told reporters yesterday that the Tongru Highway will be fully started in the shortest possible time. The road surface will be paved with coal slag, and the width will also be increased. In the future, the Tongru Highway will be as flat as before, and traffic will be smooth and convenient, he said.

Hangzhou

Replenishing Police Force, Receiving Guns and Ammunition

### The Treaty with Italy is Excessively Harsh. The Italian Prime Minister Expresses Dissatisfaction. The Representatives of the Enemy Countries Speak for the First Time at the Peace Conference. They Hope that the Sacrifices Made Can Receive Some Compensation.

[Reported by this newspaper] Paris, 10th Instant, Emergency Broadcast: When the European Peace Conference convened at 3:10 PM this afternoon (midnight Shanghai time), Italian Prime Minister Gasperi delivered a speech, saying that Italy was attending the Peace Conference as a defeated country, and said that he felt that the Italian Peace Treaty was very harsh. If this conference is truly a tool for revitalization and international cooperation, then the sacrifices made by the Italians can at least receive some compensation here. According to Article 2 of the United Nations Charter of San Francisco, in international relations, all parties agree to reject the use of force, and at the same time, in order to conform to the principle of sovereign equality, all countries should mutually guarantee "territorial integrity and political independence." Italy has already been punished for its fascist past, and it seems that all nations should restore the new spirit of international cooperation in the future, but the harsh provisions in the treaty force me to make some appeals. If we consider our defense capabilities, then our independence will even be in imminent danger. In the modern history of our country, the doors have never been opened so wide as this time, and our defense capabilities have never been subject to such harsh restrictions. Gasperi concluded by saying: Please do not forget the Potsdam Agreement of August 2, 1945. Italy was the first Axis country to break off relations with Germany and made a concrete contribution to the collapse of the Nazis on the Allied side. We were the first to join the Allies and declare war on Japan. We automatically liberated ourselves from the fascist regime and embarked on the path of progress towards a democratic political system. All of this was recognized by the Potsdam Conference. But what about this draft Italian Peace Treaty? It seems that the Italian nation has disappeared from the stage of history, and so on.

### From Underground Work to President: The Continued Success of René Coty

René Coty, the President and Foreign Minister of the French Provisional Government, has always been a skillful mediator. In a country full of elderly politicians, the 46-year-old Coty was able to rise to become the nation's leader because of his ability to reconcile various parties. During the occupation period, he coordinated the various anti-enemy underground forces, enabling them to come together. After the victory, this responsibility became even greater, because on the international front, Coty believed that France must act as a mediator between the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and Canada, so that they can live in harmony; otherwise, France will be sacrificed in the conflict between these two sides. Domestically, his policy is to make the many different parties and elements in the cabinet focus on the urgent needs of the country. Usually, his approach is to make them see how domestic conflicts will affect France's international position. His cabinet was born in a complex and eventful period internationally, and is also charged with the mission of formulating the future French constitution, so Coty's responsibilities can be said to be greater than those of any Prime Minister in French history.

Coty is short in stature, with a calm appearance but a highly impulsive inner self, but he has extremely strong physical strength and courage, which is one of his greatest characteristics. Because of this, he sometimes acts recklessly, even acting rashly without any consideration. But at other times, he is extremely flexible, able to circumvent obstacles that are difficult to overcome, and take another path. This is what we often saw him do when he was Foreign Minister in de Gaulle's government.

In 1918, as World War I was coming to an end, Coty was drafted into the army. After the war ended, Coty decided to enter the field of education, teaching at the Lycée de Versailles. At that time, he also became interested in social movements and served as the editor-in-chief of a newspaper. This newspaper was originally unknown and attracted little attention, but because of the strong and powerful editorials he wrote, sales immediately increased significantly. In 1936, he wrote in support of Léon Blum's Popular Front government; on the Spanish question, he sympathized with the left wing; and his most important pre-war editorial was a critique of the Munich Agreement.

In 1939, when the Second World War broke out, Coty immediately joined the army. In May 1940, the division to which he belonged was surrounded by German troops, and he himself was captured and imprisoned in a concentration camp. He was finally released a year later. After his release, he immediately sought contact with French underground workers. He wanted to rescue his comrades who were still in concentration camps, and he wanted to liberate France from the chains of iron fetters. Unlike other patriots, he did not go abroad, but remained in France, organizing various underground anti-enemy forces to fight the Germans. During the day, he taught at the university, and at night, he discussed strategies and planned arrangements with his comrades. His personality and reputation were his best guarantee; he never disguised or hid, but simply came and went in peace. No one suspected that this calm young man was a figure bearing such a heavy mission.

After the victory of the war, General de Gaulle returned to Paris. Coty, because he was on good terms with all parties - left, right, middle class, workers - he could get along with them and coordinate them, so as a result, Coty served as Foreign Minister in de Gaulle's cabinet. Later, de Gaulle resigned, and his successor, President Gouin, disagreed with him politically. Coty, with the joint support of the left and right wings, jumped to become the youngest president in French history.

Coty only married last year. The new First Lady, who has long served in diplomatic circles, was a loyal comrade in Coty's underground work days and made a great contribution to the liberation of France. Currently, she is Coty's most powerful advisor and assistant.

### Mayor Wu Invites the Press to Report on Municipal Facilities and Discuss Various Issues: Economic Difficulties are Paramount; Nearly 200,000 Children Out of School; Revenue Does Not Meet Expenditures, Open Up New Revenue Sources and Reduce Expenditures; Solve the Housing Shortage by Encouraging House Construction

[Report from our newspaper] At 3:00 PM yesterday, Mayor Wu hosted the heads of various newspapers in the city at the Municipal Government Conference Room for the third symposium. Those in attendance included Feng Youzhen, Cheng Cangbo, Wang Yunsheng, Chen Xunian, Zuo Shunsheng, Zhan Wenhuan, Gu Zhizhong, Zhao Minheng, Yuan Rongyu, and more than 30 others. Mayor Wu first reported on the Municipal Government's organization, handling of public property, revenue and expenditure situation, and current status of projects, and then invited discussion on issues such as sanitation, education, housing shortage, and transportation. The meeting proceeded in a harmonious and enthusiastic atmosphere and adjourned at around 5:00 PM.

Mayor Wu first presented a report on the organization of the Municipal Government, stating that it was indeed large. It was determined that three principles should be implemented: (1) The number of Municipal Government employees should not exceed the total number of employees of the previous Municipal Government, the Public Concession Board, and the French Concession Municipal Council. Some believe that with the unification of the Municipal Government, the number of employees should be further reduced than before. However, in the past, the total number of citizens in these three districts was about 3.4 million, but now the number of citizens who have applied for ID cards from the Municipal Government has reached 3.67 million. If we add the number of people who have not yet obtained certificates, the total number of citizens in Shanghai is about 4.5 million. As the number of people has increased, the workload has also increased, so the number of Municipal Government employees cannot be reduced any further. (2) It is proposed to increase the number of senior Municipal Government officials. Shanghai is different from inland cities. In inland city governments, it is enough for one or two people to understand foreign languages, but in the Shanghai Municipal Government, officials with considerable positions must be proficient in at least two languages. Among the junior officials, there are too few talented people. Shanghai's cultural level is very high, and it is not easy to handle affairs. The level of foreign political positions depends on the nature of the service. It is not easy to do if the Shanghai Municipal Government wants to adopt the organization of city governments such as Hankou and Chongqing, so the number of senior officials must be increased. (3) Regarding the institutions attached to the Municipal Government, 80-90% of them were originally owned by the former British and French Concession era. Other organizations, such as the Committee for Relief of Unemployed Workers, have no precedents, but are also necessary to be established in fact. Other institutions are currently being strictly examined, and if there is no need for their existence, they will be abolished. The Mayor then talked about the current situation of downsizing the Municipal Government, saying that the Municipal Government and its affiliated bureaus have cut more than 370 people, including more than 100 people from the Municipal Government headquarters.

### Municipal Public Property Will Never Be Sold; Revenue Does Not Meet Expenditures, Open Up New Revenue Sources and Reduce Expenditures

Regarding the handling of public property of the Municipal Government, some newspapers have criticized the Municipal Government for not cleaning up and planning to sell it. The Mayor said: "I will never sell the public property in my hands." However, this matter cannot be handled by the Municipal Government Public Property Clearing Committee, but must be based on the Land Law, approved by the Executive Yuan, and agreed by the public opinion organ (such as the Municipal Council). At present, each bureau should first hand over the inventory of the received public property to the Land Administration Bureau for clearing, and then allow citizens to review it and publicly solicit reports of any concealment. It is rumored that when the French Concession transferred public property to the puppet organization, there were concealment situations. The Municipal Government has submitted inquiries to the French consulate.

The fact that the Municipal Government's revenue does not meet its expenditures is indeed true. The solution is nothing more than opening up new revenue sources and reducing expenditures. The Municipal Government cannot talk about the way to open up new revenue sources. If you have any good ideas that can increase revenue without disturbing the people, I would appreciate your guidance.

Two Major Projects

Regarding the projects undertaken by the Municipal Government, the two largest expenditures are flood control projects. The Municipal Government has already paid 80 million yuan in this area, and the Bureau of Public Works requires at least 100 million yuan. The second is the seawall project, and the Municipal Government has also spent 10 million yuan.

The Mayor also mentioned cracking down on theft at the docks, and the Municipal Government has paid attention to it. Based on secret reports, 19 people from 36 gangs of dock bandits were arrested, and several of them were famous criminals. The Mayor then invited those present to express their opinions on four issues: sanitation, out-of-school school-age children, housing shortage, and traffic congestion.

Education

The Mayor said that fundamentally there are not enough schools, and if you want to add them, the Municipal Government's finances are very difficult, and the problem is difficult to solve. Gu Zhizhong suggested that it is better to open primary and secondary schools at night, and that students still have formal qualifications. Wang Yunsheng said that his six sons and daughters are currently busy with transfer exams, running around under the scorching sun, which is very pitiful. His youngest son wants to enter kindergarten, and he also has to be busy with exams in the morning and afternoon. He advocated that students from the rear who have formal proof documents should be allowed to enroll without exams. In addition, he also advocated that the method of giving public financial subsidies to students from the rear should be continued. Mayor Wu said that the current municipal elementary schools enroll a total of 66,000 students, and private elementary schools enroll about 201,000 students, for a total of 207,000 students. However, according to Shanghai's population, there should be about 450,000 school-age children. If the two-shift system is changed, 480 classes can be added, and 24,000 children can be enrolled, but 700 teachers must be added, and the Municipal Government's burden will increase by 140 million yuan. If students pay a certain amount of teacher's fees, such as 2,000 yuan per month, parents should be able to afford it, and expansion can be achieved. Poor students can be exempted from meals. Feng Youzhen advocated a half-day class system, so that one school can be used as two schools. He believes that the tuition fees of municipal elementary schools may be appropriately increased, but there is no need to establish separate items such as entertainment fees. Zuo Shunsheng said that the Municipal Government should also pay attention to social education, and Shanghai should not have a public library that can accommodate 10,000 people. Zhao Minheng and Zhan Wenhuan also expressed their opinions. At this point, Mayor Wu said again.

Shanghai's Housing Shortage

Is indeed a fact, and a solution has been drafted: (1) Instruct owners in areas with convenient transportation to build houses as soon as possible, and the Central Bank can provide subsidies. If the owners delay building, their land will be used as shares and the Real Estate Association will be asked to build on their behalf. If they still refuse to agree, the Municipal Government will levy a considerable fee. (2) Build 150 affordable housing villages, but there are too many registered people. If the rent is low, the competition will be uneven. If the rent is high, there will be suspicion of profiteering. Therefore, it is planned to sell them and use the proceeds to build new houses.

Sanitation Problems

Currently, garbage is piled up, and the Municipal Government sends trucks to clear it, which is not economical. In the future, it is planned to entrust it to the Baojia system. Each household must have a container for garbage, which will be concentrated in one place at a fixed time, and then cleared. The Health Bureau is drafting a solution.

Transportation Problems

Several solutions have been drafted: (1) Designate parking areas, (2) Increase one-way routes, (3) In the future, air force vehicles must be parked in designated locations and are not allowed to travel on the road. The details of this matter will be decided at the meeting on August 15.

### A Witness Who Exposed Yang Wendao's Case Years Ago Caught "Cao Cao" on a Narrow Road on the Yuezhou Ship; Attempt to Change Name and Disguise Thwarted

[Our Report] At 9:30 yesterday morning, the Yuezhou ship, berthed at the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund of Jinling Road, honked its whistle frequently, about to sail to Hong Kong. Suddenly, a black-牌汽 (no direct translation of this phrase) military vehicle sped over, and a young man led a forensic doctor directly to the third-class cabin on the ship. At that time, a thin Cantonese man in his fifties, his leg bandaged in gauze, was sitting on a canvas. Seeing them walk in, he immediately lay face down on the bed, wearing black glasses, as if to avoid their attention. This young man was none other than Yang Hanzhi, the son of Yang Wendao. And this man in his fifties was none other than Zeng Yuanjin (i.e., Zeng Yuan), an important witness in the Yang case who exposed Yang Wendao as the murderer of Nakayama Hideo. When the bailiff asked Zeng Yuan's name, Zeng Yuan replied: "My surname is Cao, my name is Cao." Yang Hanzhi directly rebuked him for his lies, pointed out that he was indeed Zeng Yuan himself, and said that there were photos in his pocket that could prove it. The bailiff also showed a subpoena, and when Zeng Yuan saw the words "Resisting the subpoena will result in arrest" and "Handed over to the bailiff to be taken back" on the subpoena, he could not help but turn pale, bowed his head and said nothing. He handed over the banknotes in his bag and the hand-carved items to his friend, and together they followed Yang and others ashore, entered a car, and went to the Zhejiang Road High Court. Yang Hanzhi had been waiting on the ship since 8 o'clock the night before, and had been waiting for fourteen hours, so that Zeng Yuan, who was trying to escape, could not escape the net.

The court opened a temporary investigation hearing at 12:30 to question him. First, Yang Wendao was brought up and asked about his age and birthplace. Then Zeng Yuan was brought up. Zeng Yuan no longer called himself Cao Cao in this solemn court. The judge asked him if he knew Yang Wendao, and he replied that he did. He also said that he met Zheng Weimin when they were getting morphine injections, and that another witness, Zhang Chen, was his childhood classmate. The judge then flipped through the files and sternly asked why he had conspired to frame him at the time. Zeng Yuan replied that there was no such thing. The judge was extremely angry and ordered him to be sent to the prosecutor's office for investigation. Thus, on the afternoon of the anniversary of Japan's surrender, Zeng Yuan was sent to the detention center of the District Prosecutor's Office, where Yang Wendao had been detained ten years ago.

### The Gold Brick Case Concluded and Awaiting Judgment: Yang Dewei and Others Provide Detailed Information on the Process of Pawning and Selling the Gold Brick; Chen Yuansheng Still Claims He Was Confused for a Moment

[Our Report] The Central Bank's stolen gold brick case was retried by the judge in the Criminal Court No. 2 of the District Court at 2:30 yesterday afternoon. Pan Jia_, former assistant manager and director of the business department of the former city bank, and Yang Dewei, the deputy director, were summoned to the court. The main suspect Chen Yuansheng and other defendants Wu Mingguang, Wang Shumei, Chen Youqing, and Shi Xianglong all appeared in court. The interrogation lasted for three hours and ended at 5:30. The case has been concluded and is scheduled to be sentenced at 12:00 noon on the 15th of this month.

According to Yang Dewei, at 2:00 p.m. on April 24th, Pan _ ordered me to accompany Wang Shumei (manager of Xinda Stock Company, representing the person who came forward to make the mortgage) to mortgage the gold brick to Wu Mingguang (assistant manager of Chongqing Bank, who accepted the mortgage), because Wang and Wu did not know each other, so I was ordered to introduce them. At that time, Pan only said that the gold brick was for a friend to make a mortgage. After handing it over to Wu, I did not look at it due to the urgency of time and the relationship of trust. After more than ten minutes, I brought back the mortgage application. At 11:30 a.m. on May 4th, Chen Yuansheng wanted to _ go, so he asked me to call and buy it from San Tai Bank. The old bookkeeper of Chongqing Bank carried the gold brick away. I do not know English (there is English on the gold brick), and I do not know that the gold brick was _obtained. When asked, Pan Jia_ falsely claimed: In the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), he and Chen Yuansheng were trainees together, so they had known each other for a long time. When Chen brought the gold brick on April 24th, he said that the goods were mortgaged on behalf of a friend, and the gold brick was wrapped in paper. Because Chongqing Bank does not lend to private individuals, and Wang Shumei is the manager of Xinda, he asked Wang Shumei to represent and make the mortgage. I got a profit of 1.35 cents in interest. When it was due, I did not sell it for him. As a result, Yang Dewei sold it to Chen Youqing of San Tai Bank for the original owner for 1.615 million at the market price. I did not know that gold could not be mortgaged, because the Bankers Association issued a notice on March 20 saying that it could be mortgaged.

The main suspect, Chen Yuansheng, had a buzz cut and wore a plaid cotton short shirt and pants. He still claimed: He was confused for a moment and had no choice but to take this step. The other defendants' confessions were similar to the previous ones. At this point, the defense lawyers stood up one after another to defend their clients, and it ended at 5:30. The court debate ended and the sentence was set for the 15th. Chen Yuansheng was returned to custody, and the other defendants were still released on their original bail.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor:

With utmost respect, concerning the letter from Li Ming'en, the captain of the First Brigade of the Independent Police of the Northeast Railway Police Bureau, published in your newspaper on the 10th, his letter contains statements that confuse and mislead. The fact is that the patrol gendarmerie squad leader had already sent three conscripted soldiers back to the gendarmerie to impersonate three suspects (not traffic police) before the incident occurred. Therefore, only the squad leader and one soldier, Chen Feng, remained at the police station. At the time, there were approximately thirty traffic police officers present. How could they dare to assault their superiors? Moreover, at that time, the squad leader alone went forward to question them, and one of the traffic police officers struck the squad leader on the right neck with a flashlight, followed by a group assault. Another soldier stepped forward to stop them and was also assaulted, and his handgun was snatched away. The police station knew the situation very well at the time. This is the first point. Furthermore, when our team's platoon leader, Wu, entered their brigade headquarters to negotiate amicably with Captain Li, why did violence break out outside? The reason is that one of the traffic police officers from the brigade snuck out from the back door and walked toward the gendarmerie squad. The gendarmerie questioned him, and the officer shouted towards his barracks, "The gendarmerie is arresting me! Comrades, help me!" As a result, the traffic police officers became agitated. Initially, a shot was fired from the barracks wall at the gendarmerie (said to be the sound of a handgun). Subsequently, dozens of police officers rushed out of the barracks on both sides of the road, shouting "Charge! Kill!" They charged at the gendarmerie with Tommy guns, carbines, rifles, handguns, etc. As a result, the outnumbered gendarmerie members fled. This is the second point. Also, when they rushed out of the barracks, they fired wildly. It is not without mistakes. Because at that time, the gendarmerie was outnumbered and fled towards Yuyao Road to the right of their barracks. And the wounded were on Changde Road in front of their barracks, and those injured on the right side of the road (on the right sidewalk of Changde Road towards Yuyao Road) had bullet wounds in their left arms, which then penetrated the left armpit and exited from the front right waist. The person on the left was shot in the buttocks and the bullet exited from the front abdomen. And both of their heads were facing the Yuyao Road direction of the gendarmerie, clearly showing they were injured by gunfire from behind. Because if they were injured by the gendarmerie's gunfire, the bullet would have entered from the front of the injured and they would have fallen backwards. This is the third point. These facts cannot be erased. I hope that authoritative members of the press will conduct on-site investigations and conduct multiple interviews to rectify this matter in the name of justice. I am deeply grateful.

Sincerely,

Sun Jidi, Captain of the Shanghai West Gendarmerie Team.

### Public Works Bureau Hosts Journalists to Visit the Gaoqiao Seawall Project - Workers Chant "Hang Yu" Under the Scorching Sun

Yesterday morning, as the Customs House clock struck eight, the Water Hotel on the Bund was unusually lively. Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zukang, Structural Department Director and Seawall Engineering Team Leader Zhu Guozhi, Secretary Qian Weifan, Ms. Smith, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Sino-American Industrial Association, and reporters from various newspapers occupied a large portion of the Water Hotel. Director Zhao stood up and said, "Today, the Bureau is hosting you reporters to visit the Gaoqiao Seawall project. This project started last month, and we hosted reporters twice at that time. Now, the seawall project will be completed by the middle of next month, so we are specially hosting you again for a visit..."

At 8:30, the sound of the ferryboats at the wharf urged us to board the boat. Director Zhao hurriedly concluded his speech, and everyone rushed onto the boat.

The boat slowly moved. After enjoying the scenery for a full hour and a half, the ferry took us to Gaoqiao. Upon landing, the Public Works Bureau's special cars were waiting for us at the pier. It was three kilometers from Gaoqiao Town to the seawall. The feeling of sitting in the large cars was unique. The car drove on a narrow and rugged dirt road, bouncing violently. The trees along the road occasionally reached into the car windows and hit the heads and faces of the passengers.

At the seawall, piles of dike-building materials, large stones, gravel, wood, foreign coal, fine sand, etc., were piled high. Workers were driving wooden piles along the coast, their bodies tanned black by the scorching sun. Their work is arduous, but it is great! The seawall is the barrier of this city, but because it has been in disrepair for many years, the body of the seawall has largely collapsed. In order to prevent flooding, the municipal government decided to rush to repair this emergency project.

The repair project is divided into four steps: (1) laying the foundation, (2) driving piles, (3) pouring cement, and (4) laying large stones. According to Director Zhu, after this repair project, at least thirty years of peace can be guaranteed, but if it is not repaired again, the mud dike will be subjected to the fierce attack of seawater day and night, and after four or fifty years, Gaoqiao will be unimaginable!

After we held an "indoor picnic," we walked along the seawall and visited two other breaches. Then, along the original road, the cars carried us back to Gaoqiao Pier. As we boarded the ferry, the workers' shouts of "Hang Yu" echoed in our ears.

In a daze, the ferry returned to Shanghai. Stepping onto the Bund, the Customs House clock was striking three-thirty. (Si Zai)

### Ministry of Education Sends Secretary Yang to Shanghai to Distribute Subsidies to University Faculty and Staff - Totaling 140 Million for Beijing and Shanghai - Funds Provided by the U.S. Aid to China Commission - Distribution in Nanjing Scheduled for the 15th

[Report from Our Nanjing Office] Since the victory, prices have soared, and the cost of living has risen, especially in Beijing and Shanghai. Professors at various universities in Beijing and Shanghai have repeatedly appealed to the Ministry of Education during June and July due to severe pressure from the cost of living. Vice Minister Hang of the Ministry of Education has been concerned about this matter and has gone to Shanghai to have sincere talks with professors from various universities and held meetings with professors in Beijing to exchange ideas. From the professors' point of view, the actual situation requires relief, but for all public employees, the authority belongs to the Executive Yuan, and comprehensive planning is necessary, making it difficult to find a perfect solution. Fortunately, the new treatment of public employees has been adjusted, and Vice Minister Hang of the Ministry of Education has made the greatest efforts for the immediate relief of the professors and obtained the support of the U.S. Aid to China Commission, which has allocated 140 million yuan in national currency in a short period of time to subsidize the temporary expenses of professors at Chinese universities. This fund has been delivered to the Ministry of Education, and Secretary Yang Shaobai has departed for Shanghai by train on the 9th to handle the distribution of this subsidy. It is reported that faculty and staff of public and private (licensed private) colleges and above can receive this subsidy: 100,000 yuan per professor, 90,000 yuan per associate professor, 80,000 yuan per lecturer and assistant teacher, and 70,000 yuan per staff member, as a one-time subsidy. Subsidies for faculty and staff of public and private colleges and above in Nanjing are scheduled to be distributed on the 15th.

### The Number of Applicants for Guangzhou Secondary and Higher Education Schools Far Exceeds the Enrollment Quota - Vocational Schools Have Lower Tuition Fees

[Report from Our Guangzhou Office] The Zhongshan Daily recently reported on the problem of schooling for university and secondary school students, saying: "Guangzhou is an important town in South China, but its cultural level is much lower than that of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, and there are very few schools. According to statistics, there are no more than one hundred public and private schools in the city. This pitiful number inevitably makes the parents of students anxious. In order to help parents understand the general situation of the schools, the reporter will make a simple report here for reference:

Universities

In the next semester, the universities in this city include National Zhongda University, Provincial College of Arts and Sciences, Provincial College of Law and Commerce, Private Lingnan University, Guangzhou University, National University, and China Cultural Academy. Statistically, the total enrollment quota of the above colleges is about 3,000. In addition, Beijing, Nankai, and Qinghua universities are also recruiting students in Guangzhou. These three universities are expected to recruit no more than 1,000 students nationwide, while the total number of students in this city who want to apply to universities is about 23,000, with a ratio of one to seven. Therefore, applying to universities next semester is quite difficult. Before applying, you must carefully select the schools and subjects and be fully prepared.

Secondary Schools

The provincial secondary schools include Zhongqin, Zhixin, Zhongyuan, Guangya, Zhongzheng, and Girls' Normal School. The municipal secondary schools include Municipal Normal School and Municipal No. 1 Secondary School. The private secondary schools include Pui Ching, Pui To, South China Attached High School, True Light, Concord, Pui Ying, Pui Kwai, South China, and Overseas Chinese and Changfeng. However, the tuition fees for private secondary schools will increase the burden on general parents in the next semester. The fees for each private school are roughly: 100 kilograms of rice for high school tuition, 25,000 yuan for tuition, and 25,000 yuan for miscellaneous fees; 80 kilograms of rice for junior high school tuition, 20,000 yuan for tuition, and 20,000 yuan for miscellaneous fees; 60 kilograms of rice for elementary school tuition and miscellaneous fees of 30,000 yuan. With this amount, if an ordinary family has several children in school, the burden on the parents' shoulders is truly unbearable. The "approximate number" for the tuition fees of private schools is of course a bit too high. Provincial schools only need to pay several thousand yuan in miscellaneous fees because they have government subsidies, but it will become a difficult problem when applying to schools. Vocational schools - the national vocational schools outside the province include Nanchang Zhongzheng Medical College and Wuchang Maritime Vocational School. The municipal vocational schools include Municipal No. 1 Vocational School. The private vocational schools include Accounting School and China Women's Vocational School. If you are interested in learning a specialized skill, applying to a vocational school is the best choice. The tuition fees of private vocational schools are generally affordable for parents from ordinary families.

### Ministry of Education Orders the Bureau of Education to Shut Down Two Medical Colleges in the City

### Q&A on Household Registration Laws (Continued)

(IV) Temporary Residence and Population Migration Registration (49) Question: Can the prevalent cohabitation of men and women be called marriage, and how should it be registered?

Answer: The distinction of households must be based on the length of residence. Although cohabiting men and women do not meet the conditions for marriage, the standard for establishing a household does not change accordingly. However, the head of the household should be determined by the permanent resident. If one of the men or women is a permanent resident of the place, they should be registered in the local register according to law. If they have another residence elsewhere and are only occasionally present, they cannot be considered members of the household at the cohabitation residence. If both parties are only occasionally present, they should be registered in the mobile household or temporary residence register according to the length of residence. (50) Question: Is it not necessary to obtain the permission of the supervisory authorities to set up a temporary household registration and remove a household registration from a register?

Answer: This is different from the provisions of Article 46 of the Household Registration Law and does not require the permission of the supervisory authorities.

(VI) Other

(11) Question: Can the Director of Household Registration use subpoenas when enforcing penalties?

Answer: The issuance of subpoenas is a judicial function, and autonomous organizations may not use them. When the Director of Household Registration enforces penalties, he/she should submit the cases to the District Office, County Government, or judicial authorities for approval, depending on the circumstances.

Business News

### Cotton Importers Hesitant After Suspension of Foreign Exchange Supply; Large Quantities of Indian Cotton Also Not Exchanged Normally

[Reported by this newspaper] The Central Bank recently sent the 49th Notice to all designated foreign exchange banks, stating: The Central Bank has recently received reports that some importers are still importing raw materials from abroad without obtaining the Central Bank's permission. Therefore, the Central Bank hereby notifies all designated banks that if the import of the said raw cotton has not been approved by the Central Bank in advance, the designated banks must not sell foreign exchange. Any designated bank that violates this provision will be subject to the penalty of being suspended from operating foreign exchange business, and the importer will no longer be granted the convenience of settling foreign exchange. According to news from the import and export circles in this city: In recent weeks, some importers and manufacturers in this city have successively ordered as many as 100,000 bales of raw cotton from the United States, totaling 20 million US dollars. The Central Bank's sudden issuance of the 49th Notice is tantamount to putting all the said raw cotton orders on hold. It is reported that recently, importers have also ordered large quantities of raw cotton from India. The funds required to purchase the said raw cotton may not be obtained through the Central Bank, but through settlement in Hong Kong. The delivery procedures are always handled in this city, with payment in legal tender or Hong Kong dollars, or by private telegraphic transfer. In recent weeks, large quantities of Indian raw cotton have been traded through this transaction method without interference from the Central Bank. Therefore, some importers and manufacturers have also ordered raw cotton from the United States and Brazil at the same time. Importers and manufacturers believe that the consumption of raw cotton in this city is increasing day by day, and the Central Bank may consider supplying foreign exchange for the import of this batch of raw cotton. Judging from the Central Bank's 49th Notice, this expectation has obviously been dashed. The importers believe that since the Central Bank has not formally announced a ban on the import of raw cotton, and has tolerated the import of large quantities of Indian cotton, and has not stipulated in the regulations in advance that each new transaction of raw cotton must go through approval procedures, the importers have followed the large-scale import of Indian cotton and ordered raw cotton from the United States. It is also reported that before the issuance of the 49th Notice, importers could pay for the import of American cotton in US dollars, or by private telegraphic transfer. After this warning from the Central Bank, the designated banks will no longer be able to accept this method of settling payment.

The reporter then inquired about this matter from Lin Weiying, Director of the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank, who said: The Central Bank's 49th Notice was originally to reiterate the provisions of the notice issued by the bank on April 27 of this year. The previous notice had already stipulated that unless otherwise notified, the designated banks must not sell official foreign exchange for newly ordered raw cotton from now on. He said: At present, the inventory of raw cotton in this city is very sufficient and can be used until February of next year, so there is no need to import it again, so as to avoid wasting foreign exchange funds. Lin pointed out that the recent import of large quantities of Indian raw cotton and the indirect settlement method are illegal.

### Gold and Banknotes Stable; Hong Kong Dollars Continue to Be Popular; Rumor that Hong Kong Bans Exports

The ingot continued to hover in the same place yesterday. It opened at 1.932 million in the morning. After opening, it first saw 1.925 million. Then, due to the registration and allocation relationship, the buying stopped slightly and fell slightly. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 40 bars, and the price was still 1.9175 million. After entering, it once fell back to 1.915 million. There were very few transactions, and it was difficult to cause a big change. At noon, it was still around 1.92 million. It rose slightly in the afternoon. As a result, it rose by 11,000 compared to the previous close. Gilded gold, patterned silver, and silver dollars remained unchanged. The underground discount rate was still 1.23. Supply and demand of funds were gradually balanced.

Only Hong Kong dollars continued to be popular among foreign currencies. US dollars were lifeless. They opened at 2,530 yuan in the morning with supply. They once retreated to 2,510 yuan. At noon, they hovered around 2,520 yuan. The situation was stable in the afternoon. As a result, they rose by 5 yuan compared to the previous close. There was demand for Hong Kong banknotes with little supply. It was rumored that Hong Kong prohibited the export of banknotes, resulting in a price that was more than 20 yuan higher than the Hong Kong exchange rate. As a result, it rose by another 10 yuan. Hong Kong exchange rate was 548 yuan to 553 yuan, with many transactions. The exchange rates of Indian, British, and American currencies remained unchanged.

### Both Chinese and Foreign Stocks Weak

Chinese stocks once showed some brilliance in the middle of the day, but it was only temporary. High prices were for Yongsha at 710 yuan, Maya at 3,900 yuan, Jingfu at 220 yuan, Xinguang at 220 yuan, and Qinxing at 162 yuan. Low prices near noon were for Yongsha at 688 yuan, Maya at 3,780 yuan, Jingfu and Xinguang at 205 yuan, and Qinxing at 153 yuan. Unpopular small and medium-sized stocks and veteran stocks continued to show sluggishness. Major players entered and exited differently, and people still felt oppressed. They were all planning to close out their positions. Changes may come and there may be a longer period of hovering. As a result, Maya closed flat compared to the previous close, while Yongsha, Jingfu, and Xinguang all fell slightly. Qinxing was relatively stable. Some unpopular small and medium-sized stocks did not move, while others fell slightly. Veteran stocks continued to fall slightly. After closing, both Xinguang and Jingfu small stocks were bid up to above 220 yuan.

Foreign stocks were still worried about being cold. They could not withstand the pressure of scattered supply. Large stocks still had one or two active players. Although they did not advance or retreat, cold stocks lacked maintenance and were showing signs of weakness. As a result, the steel industry and Yeguang each fell by more than half a percentage point compared to the previous close. Shipping and Jardine Matheson fell slightly. The rest lacked change.

### Government Bonds Rose Slightly; More Buyers for Unified E Bonds

Unified E Bonds, which have a long redemption period, had some buying activity. The rest were also slightly affected. Unified C Bonds rebounded from 620 yuan to above 650 yuan at the close, rising slightly by 10 yuan compared to the previous close. The same was true for A and B Bonds. D Bonds rose by 40 yuan, while E Bonds rose by 50 yuan alone.

### Rayon Strong and Outstanding

Rayon, which had been rising for several days, was still strong and outstanding in the market yesterday. 120-count Tianqiao had light, and transactions were made at 1.63 million yuan. In the afternoon, bids were up by 10,000 yuan, which was 30,000 yuan more than the previous day. 120-count miscellaneous brands had light, and the asking price was also up by 20,000 yuan. 150-count had light, and 75-count semi-light were both bid up by 10,000 yuan. Only 120-count semi-light was not asked about and was still bid at the original price of the previous day. It is said that Hua Jin requires a lot of rayon for weaving. Meiya bedding silk saw a good price of 10,000 yuan. The holder of Hua Jin quoted a price of 2,100 yuan and finally traded at 2,070 yuan, which was 20 yuan more than the previous day.

### One Load of Cocoons is Equal to Three Loads of Rice; Standard Price for Autumn Cocoons

Agricultural Bank Releases 1 Billion Yuan for Seed Loans

Government Purchases Autumn Silk

Regarding various issues related to autumn cocoons, officials, merchants, and Zhongling Company from the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai carefully discussed and agreed that the determination of the price of autumn cocoons is a prerequisite for solving the problem of autumn cocoons. After various considerations, it was decided to take food as the standard, so as to avoid silkworm farmers being affected by price fluctuations and suffering losses. It was stipulated that the price of three loads of rice in the market would be converted into the price of one load of autumn cocoons. The price of autumn silkworm seeds is 2,000 yuan per new sheet and 1,500 yuan per old sheet. Please ask the Farmers Bank to lend 1 billion yuan for the purchase of seeds. In addition, manufacturers will subsidize 1,000 yuan per sheet so that seed merchants will not lose money. It is learned that 600,000 sheets of autumn silkworm seeds will be available for sale around the 20th of this month. It is also learned that the production costs of manufacturers were also discussed at this meeting. Because the loss for each load of silk is as high as 1.3 million to 1.4 million yuan, it is heard that the government will purchase autumn silk this year and give reasonable profits to the factories based on their costs to maintain the silk industry.

### Large Quantities of Taiwan Sugar to Arrive in Shanghai Soon; Allocation Methods to Change; Price Remains the Same; Allocation Twice a Week; Associations, Cooperatives, and Foreign Trade Companies Apply

[Reported by this newspaper] According to a person in charge of Taiwan Sugar Company, the company will ship 19,000 tons of sugar (approximately 200,000 bags) from Keelung, Taiwan, to Shanghai in the next three weeks. According to the scheduled date, the first batch of 9,000 tons of sugar, approximately 100,000 bags, will be shipped to Shanghai by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyu wheel on the 18th of this month. The second and third batches of sugar, each of 5,000 tons, approximately 55,500 bags per batch, will be shipped by the Taiwan Shipping Company's Tainan transport and the Taiwan An Shipping Company's Taiwan An transport on the 26th of this month and the 2nd of next month, respectively. Therefore, the sugar inventory in this city will become more abundant.

The registration for the ninth phase of low-priced sugar ended on the 9th. Payment will be made on the 12th, and delivery will be made on the 14th and 15th. Generally, it will be available for widespread sale on the 17th. It is heard that a total of 26,910 bags of sugar will be allocated in the ninth phase, of which sugar merchants account for 10,000 bags, Southern goods industry accounts for 8,000 bags, and other tea and food industries, direct users, and foreign users account for 8,910 bags. The allocation price for this phase is exactly the same as that of the eighth phase. Therefore, the retail price is still 820 yuan per catty, and each person is limited to purchasing 3 catties. It is also heard that the method of allocating sugar by the Social Affairs Bureau will change slightly from the tenth phase, as follows: (1) Allocation will be made once every two weeks; (2) The total amount allocated for each phase will be determined by the Taiwan Sugar Company; (3) The allocation price will remain at 70,000 yuan per load and will not change for the time being; (4) The allocation targets are divided into two types: local and foreign. The local target will be determined by the Social Affairs Bureau in consultation with the Taiwan Sugar Company based on the actual situation, and the allocation will be approved separately within the quota. The targets are industry associations and registered consumer cooperatives. Other stores and factories should directly request from the Taiwan Sugar Company. The inspection and assessment of the sales situation of industry associations will be handled jointly by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Taiwan Sugar Company.

### Diminishing Stock of Export Tea; British Trading Houses Go to Hangzhou for Procurement

Upon investigation, the old export tea mostly consists of what has been shelved since the Pacific War. Consequently, the quality has inevitably deteriorated. Occasionally, a small number of teas with relatively good body are still found. In recent days, exporters, seeing the favorable prices, have been scouring them all. However, although buyers continue to have demand, the market inventory of tea suitable for export is exceedingly scarce. Purchasers are therefore flocking to Hangzhou to select and purchase tea. According to news from that area, British firms Jardine Matheson and Carlowitz are currently examining samples and making offers. It is also heard that Carlowitz has already secured over 400 cases of old Anhui Keemun tea at a price of 75,000 yuan per dan (approx. 50 kg). Market sentiment is stable, and the future prospects may continue to rise. As for trading in local foreign firms, yesterday, Wu Chang Tea Company presented and drew samples of high-grade Chun Zhen, Zhen Mei, and Zhen Zhen Mei teas, totaling over 320 cases. China Tea Company purchased 150 cases of black tea and 120 cases of new Bai Lin tea. The process remained largely unchanged. However, new Bai Lin black tea has plummeted by more than half per dan compared to the opening price. Yet, due to quality considerations, the trend is subtly flat amidst an apparent decline. In addition, domestic sales of red and green teas are brisk. Wang Yu Tai Tea House took in 120 dan of freshly pan-fired green tea from Wenzhou at a price of 50,000 to 52,000 yuan per dan. Furthermore, old Shao Pan-fried Bao Zhong tea and new Longjing tea are favored by many, and prices have consistently remained good.

### Tight New Rice Supply; Market Conditions Unlikely to Return to Normal

Yesterday, the north and south markets saw the arrival of six to seven thousand shi (石, approx. 100 kg) of rice. Retailers are gradually selling their shares, with high-grade rice remaining firm and medium- to low-grade rice rising by 8,000 yuan. The supply of new japonica rice is scarce, adding 1,000 yuan, and white rice also rose by over 1,000 yuan. However, supply and demand are still balanced. Early-season new indica rice is currently being harvested. If the supply increases, market conditions may improve. Flour from the "Sailor Brand" is actively traded, while old "Cannon Cart" flour remains mediocre, and miscellaneous brands are unchanged. Very little wheat is being traded privately. High-grade wheat sees some transactions, while medium- to low-grade continues to weaken by 300 to 500 yuan and lacks customers. Factories have no demand due to low flour prices. Soybeans from producing regions are firmly expensive. The supply of new soybeans is slightly scarce, and retailers are opportunistically buying, causing prices to rise by 1,000 yuan. Old soybeans also increased by 500 to 600 yuan. Raw kernels are steady. In the oil market, the arrival of soybean oil is sporadic, and supply cannot meet demand. Summer consumption is robust, and prices have risen by over 1,000 yuan, causing soybean and rapeseed oil prices to rise as well. However, it was learned at noon that vegetable oil factories will continue to distribute oil, so market sentiment softened at the close. Soybean cake sales are slow, weakening by 100 yuan. Bran prices are similar.

### Large Shipment of Foreign Rice to Hankou

[Our Newspaper] The Sanbei Company's "Ming Xing" vessel departed for Hankou this afternoon, carrying 10,000 bags of foreign rice (approximately 400 tons), 8,000 bags of flour, and 1,060 bags of cement, all of which are relief supplies. In addition, 500 tons of waste cotton and cotton textiles are being transported to Los Angeles on the Shun Hing Foreign Firm's "Glenfarvel," managed by (manager's name). It is heard that a large shipment of tea and pig bristles, etc., will be transported to New York next week.

### Yarn Prices Stop Falling and Rise; Cotton and Cloth Transactions Are Still Good

Yesterday, the yarn market saw a slight improvement. Dealers did not take large quantities, only making small additions. Traders became more optimistic, with rumors of prices for 20-count yarn from all brands, both large and small factories, rising by 5,000 to 15,000 yuan. Yarn factories are offering a considerable amount for sale. Dasheng Yarn Factory released a large quantity of Hong Kui Xing and Cai Kui Xing brands. In addition, Shen Xin No. 3 Factory offered about 100 pieces of 20-count super-grade yarn as futures, priced at 1.24 million yuan. Market sentiment seems to have stabilized, and the trend is no longer as fragile as in previous days.

Yesterday, New York American cotton futures continued to rise by over 20 points. The recent price was US$36.07, the new crop futures price was US$32.86, and the spot price was US$36.88 (a new high). The local spot market is becoming increasingly firm, with good transactions. Shen Xin No. 1 Factory and Tong Yi, along with smaller factories, continued to take quantities, causing market prices to rise by another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.

Ningbo and Fujian merchants are rushing to buy for shipment, while spot goods are lacking in the market, so the upward pressure is stronger. Civilian-run factory fine cloth is being continuously purchased from the South China region. However, due to the off-season, the market for printed cloth is declining daily. Native-made cloth is gradually improving, with each bolt of cloth rising by 250 to 1,000 yuan. At noon, Fang Jian Company opened for sales as usual. The price of ton-sized drills remains unchanged. Ningbo drills rose by 1,500 yuan.

### New York Stock Exchange Membership Worth US$78,000

[Reuters, New York, 10th] Yesterday, a New York Stock Exchange membership was sold for US$78,000, an increase of US$1,000 from the previous price. Generally, a stock exchange seat is priced at US$75,000 for the bid and US$79,000 for the ask.

### Shortage of Spot Sugar; Single Bags Trading Over 120,000

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable, with a slight increase in transactions. The guild opened with Shantou merchants offering high-grade green sugar at 95,000 yuan, washed green sugar at 93,500 to 93,000 yuan, and high-grade red sugar at 127,000 yuan, followed by 123,000 yuan, with a total of over 300 bags transacted. Xinghua merchants offered 50 baskets of Gongfen white sugar at 130,000 yuan. Jian merchants offered 50 bags of Diaoqing sugar at 88,000 yuan. Wenzhou sugar is due to high cost and thin inventory so the price did not follow restrictions. Single bags traded above 122,000 yuan.

### Opening of Huazhong Enterprise Company

Huada Enterprise Co., Ltd. will officially open on the 12th (tomorrow). Zhang Xingbai is the chairman of the board, and Li Huaqing is the general manager. In addition to managing existing import and export businesses, it will also establish a shipping department to handle the sale, transportation, and navigation of ocean and inland river vessels of all sizes.

### Forward Exchange Contracts Invalidate if Not Settled; Consider Before Ordering

The Central Bank has stipulated that forward exchange contracts must be settled within three months. Whether purchasing machinery, industrial raw materials, or other goods, if the exchange is not settled by the due date, the contract will be invalidated, and the designated bank will reclaim the exchange bill. This regulation remains unchanged. According to a person in charge at the Central Bank, importers should be confident in their orders beforehand. If goods cannot be delivered by the due date or transportation problems cannot be resolved, they should carefully consider this in advance and not act rashly. The Central Bank will absolutely not allow failure to settle exchange by the due date. Furthermore, it is also learned that designated banks may allow merchants to apply for an extension if there are special reasons and foreign telegrams can provide proof.

### Yongli Company Continues Efforts; Borrows US$16 Million to Establish Eight Major Factories in Major Cities

Yongli Chemical Industries Corporation is planning to establish eight major factories to develop China's chemical industry: (1) Shanghai Bakelite Factory, (2) Qingdao Electrolytic Caustic Soda Factory, (3) Nanjing Ammonium Sulfate Factory, (4) Nanjing Ammonia Factory, (5) Hunan Cement Factory, (6) Hunan Glass Factory, (7) Hunan Coking Factory, (8) Xiangtan Ammonia Factory. It plans to establish five factories next year and begin production. It is heard that the Nanjing Ammonia Factory previously received a loan of 3.6 billion from the Four Banks Joint Office and has partially begun construction. The company recently borrowed US$16 million from the US Export-Import Bank to actively establish the Xiangtan Ammonia Factory. Mr. Yang Zhongfu, the manager of the Central China region, has gone to Hunan to oversee the project. The loan will be repaid with interest after sixteen years, and the interest rate is extremely low.

A management office has been established in the Hankou area to develop business. The reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the factory, who stated that the company was founded by Fan Xudong in 1917 and is located in Tanggu, Tianjin. The scale is vast, producing around 200 tons of soda ash per day, as well as chemical raw materials such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and ammonia. During the war, the Tianjin factory was seized by the enemy. The main factory was moved to Wutongqiao, Sichuan, which is a mixed-product facility producing cement, caustic soda, and other products, but in small quantities. After the war, the Tanggu factory was taken over and restarted, producing 100 tons of soda ash per day. It is expected that once all production equipment has been installed by the end of the year, it will reach pre-war production levels. The company's business operations are divided into five major regions: East China, Central China, South China, West China, and North China. Among them, North China has the most popular products. The Qinhuangdao Yaohua Glass Factory alone requires 30 tons of soda ash per day.

### Paying Tribute to the Loyal Souls at Meihua Ridge

— Our Newspaper, Yangzhou, 7th. Special Correspondent: Wang Gongwo

While casually reading "Ten Days in Yangzhou" by Wang Xiuchu of the Ming Dynasty, I couldn't help but think of Shi Kefa, the loyal hero of the era, Ming Supervisor, Minister of War, and Grand Scholar of Dongge. At the same time, I calculated that from the Ming Hongguang year of Jia Shen (the year of the Ming Dynasty's demise) to the present, it has been over three hundred years since Duke Shi sacrificed himself for the greater good.

The Old and New Sorrows of a Loyal Hero

In another book, I reacquainted myself with the hateful history of those who betrayed the Ming Dynasty: "The main reason for the Ming Dynasty's demise was not external troubles, but internal strife." Furthermore, from the current reality of China, I have a thought: If some of China's current "heroes" still want to be called "heroes" and spare no effort to ignite the fires of internal strife everywhere, causing our country and nation to miss the rare opportunity for revival and construction, then no matter who is in power in the future, no matter who is more "democratic," "progressive," or "enlightened," in the absence of sufficient modern national conditions and under time constraints, China will ultimately be nominally but not truly strong—in other words, at most, a modern "vassal state."

It was with such feelings of old and new sorrow that I visited Meihua Ridge, the location of the cenotaph of the martyr "Duke Shi Zhongzheng," to pay tribute to the loyal soul of Supervisor Shi.

Biography of Duke Shi in the Yangzhou Prefecture Chronicle

Before recounting the process of paying tribute, I think it is necessary to examine Shi Kefa's background. I remember that Yi Junzuo, the author of "Idle Talk of Yangzhou" before the war, had a record in his "Collection of Stories of National Heroes," and the standalone "Shi Kefa" published by Zhengzhong Bookstore had an even more detailed record. However, the space here may not allow for that. Below, we will simply copy a passage from the "Yangzhou Prefecture Chronicle":

"Biography of the Loyal and Upright: Shi Kefa, courtesy name Xianzhi, was from Daxing, Shuntian. His mother, Madam Yin, dreamed of Wen Tianxiang entering her house when she was pregnant, and then Kefa was born. In the Chongzhen reign, he became a Jinshi (successful candidate in the highest imperial examinations); he rose through the ranks to Right Vice Censor-in-Chief, patrolling and pacifying Anqing, Luzhou, and other places. He requested the exemption of disaster-stricken farmlands from taxation, recruited brave soldiers, repaired fortifications, and planned for war and defense day and night, so the rebels avoided his front. In the fourteenth year, he became Right Vice Minister of the Ministry of Revenue and General Transport Commissioner. Soon after, he was appointed Minister of War in Nanjing. In the seventeenth year, the fourth month, upon hearing that Li Zicheng had captured the capital, he grieved greatly! He struck his head against a pillar, and blood flowed all over his body. He wore mourning clothes and prepared to avenge the dynasty. When Prince Fu (reporter's note: i.e., Emperor Hongguang) was established, Ma Shiying led his troops in. Kefa knew that the situation was irreconcilable and requested to supervise the army in Huaiyang; he was awarded the title of Grand Protector of the Heir Apparent, Minister of War, and Grand Scholar of Wuyingdian. At that time, Gao Jie's troops were stationed in Yangzhou, and countless people were plundered and killed. Kefa submitted a memorial to have Gao Jie's troops stationed at Guazhou to pacify Yangzhou. Kefa then opened his office in Yangzhou, welcoming the virtuous and talented. He repeatedly requested funding, but Shiying refused to provide it; every time he requested to punish the rebels, he shed tears in the court. He was obstructed by Ma and Ruan (reporter's note: Ma Shiying and Ruan Dacheng were both treacherous officials at the end of the Ming Dynasty). On the twentieth day, Qing (reporter's note: the original text is in large characters, which the reporter has changed, and the same below) troops arrived and camped at Banzhuyuan. General Li Xifeng and Military Supervisor Gao Qifeng abandoned the camp and surrendered, and the situation in the city became more isolated. Various civil and military officials divided the defensive positions; the west gate of the old city was the most dangerous, and Kefa defended it himself. He wrote a letter to his mother and wife as a farewell. Since he had no son, he appointed Vice General Shi Dewei as his heir. Two days later, Qing troops attacked the city. The city was breached, and Kefa tried to commit suicide by cutting his throat, but failed. He ordered Dewei to kill him, but Dewei wept in pain and dared not look up. An adjutant pushed him out of the small east gate and was captured by Qing troops. Kefa shouted: 'I am Supervisor Shi, kill me quickly.' They tried to persuade him to surrender, but he refused and was killed. Ren Minyu, the prefect of Yangzhou, Qu Wei, the assistant prefect, Luo Fulong, the Lianghuai salt transport commissioner, Yang Zhenxi, Wu Daozheng, the magistrate in charge of supplies, Wang Zhiduan, the county magistrate of Jiangdu, Hu Ritianxing, a staff member, and Lu Wei all died with him."

With so many martyrs who died together, I felt that it was my duty to go to Meihua Ridge to pay tribute.

Minister's Plaque, "The Spirit Shakes Mountains and Rivers"

The ridge is located outside the Guangchu Gate of Yangzhou City—but the so-called ridge is actually just a small hill. Shi's ancestral hall is built beside the ridge, with more than ten rooms to the east, containing the "Meihua Immortal Hall," Shi's portrait, and many stone tablets. To the west are three large rooms. The cenotaph is located in the center of the ancestral hall, surrounded by pine and cypress trees and a wooden fence. A tall stone tablet stands in front of the hall, inscribed with the words "Tomb of Shi Kefa, Ming Supervisor, Minister of War, and Grand Scholar of Dongge."

I left through Tianning Gate (Guangchu Gate had been closed before the war), headed east along the river, and soon reached my destination. As I stepped through the gate, what immediately caught my eye, as expected, was that while the outer shells of the buildings in the ancestral hall were still intact, all the interior decorations were in a state of disrepair! In the courtyard in front of the main hall, I remembered that there were several pine and cypress trees before the war, but they were gone. However, a plaque with the golden characters "The Spirit Shakes Mountains and Rivers" on the beam in front of the main hall still existed. It seemed that it was offered by Minister He Yingqin when Mr. Wang Maoru (Bailing), a member of the Central Committee, raised funds to repair the ancestral hall in 1935.

Red Plum, Scorching Sun, Lush Weeds

I walked through the courtyard, passed through the hall, and reached the cenotaph. The cenotaph was as solemn as before. I stood in silent respect in front of it. The caretaker of the ancestral hall came to guide me and told me that General Bai Chongxi and Minister Hong Lanyou had come here to pay tribute on the 25th day of the twelfth lunar month last year. The military officers stationed in the city also often came to pay tribute. Then, he led me to Meihua Ridge. After a few steps, I looked around and the situation was even worse! The garden, which had thousands of red plum trees planted before the war, had become overgrown with weeds. The hexagonal pavilion and the iron cannon cast during the Zhenghua era, both relics of the past, were gone. The plum trees on the ridge were just two or three withered black trunks exposed to the scorching sun, which was a very depressing sight!

The Last Farewell Letter

The "Stele Pavilion" on the ridge still exists, and the stone stele embedded in the wall is still intact. I had a rubbing of Shi Kefa's last farewell letter before the war. But now, when I asked the caretaker, not even the person in charge of the ancestral hall had a copy. Reading the letter is incredibly tragic, so I copied it from the stele, with the full text and format as follows:

"Respectfully awaiting

Madam,

Madam Yang

Wishing you ten thousand blessings! Northern troops surrounded Yangzhou on the 18th, and have not attacked yet, but people's hearts have already left, and cannot be recovered. I will die sooner or later, I do not know whether Madam is willing to follow me? In such a world, it is useless to live, it is better to decide early. Madam is troubled, must entrust Fourth Master and Master, San Ke, everyone to take care of, (reporter's note: Shi's daughter) Zhao'er, good or bad, let it be, writing this, my heart is breaking! April 21st, Fa sends"

The First Masterpiece After the Chu Shi Biao

Also, in Shi Kefa's letter to Regent Dorgon, his loyalty is evident in every word, and the cleanliness and magnificence of the text is said to be the first masterpiece after the "Chu Shi Biao," which is not an exaggeration. However, it is difficult to copy the original text from the stone stele because the handwriting is cursive and difficult to distinguish, and there are more than two thousand characters.

Two Couplets and a Portrait

From the Stele Pavilion, I went to the place where Shi Kefa's portrait was enshrined. Mr. Jia, the person in charge of the ancestral hall, specially took out a precious original portrait for me to view. We talked about how the ancestral hall needed to be renovated inside and out when the situation stabilized, but where would the funds come from? ... etc. I also copied two good couplets: "In life, he had Wen Tianxiang's integrity; in death, he had Wu Xianghou's loyalty." "A few drops of plum blossom, tears for a fallen nation; a sliver of moonlight, the heart of a former official." Chanting these two couplets, I bid farewell to the loyal soul and left Meihua Ridge.

### Municipal Administration in Xi'an

— Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 2nd. Reporter: Li Chi

Although "Seven Waters Surrounding Chang'an" is a thing of the past, it is hoped that mechanical power can be used to resolve the water supply problem and promote municipal development.

In hot weather, the need for water is especially unforgettable. Xi'an, the ancient capital that once flourished in the arid loess region, has indeed had convenient and abundant water sources, as documented in historical records. The saying "Seven Waters Surrounding Chang'an" is not a falsehood. The flow of these seven waters can still be traced today. Unfortunately, due to poor human management, the deep and wide riverbeds have become increasingly shallow, and some have even dried up year-round and become historical sites. How to restore a sufficient water supply is indeed an important issue for current municipal administration and a prerequisite for future municipal development. Because water is not only related to the health of citizens, but also its sufficient supply restricts the density of the urban population, the construction of high-rise buildings, and the development of certain industrial sectors. The following event currently illustrates the negative impact: Since the beginning of July, Xi'an's power plant has stopped supplying electricity due to a coal shortage, so ordinary households' electric lights and fans are out, and Xi'an's ice factory is also affected, and the drinking water that countless citizens have relied on the ice factory's water extraction equipment to supply has immediately quadrupled in price. We watch year-round as water carts pulled by humans and animals walk around the city to supply a portion of the population with drinking water, which is almost considered a "treasure." Unless this situation improves, other excellent conditions for developing the city will remain limited. Just think: Can such a situation be allowed to continue? A low-level public school employee's entire monthly income is not enough for him to go to the bathhouse every other day!

### Pacification Work Unfolded in Guangdong

— Guangzhou Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 3rd, Special Correspondent Liang Feng

Two weeks ago, a typhoon swept in, scattering the heatwave! In recent days, it has rained almost every night, making this southern coastal province seem particularly peaceful. Here, in the local news sections of all newspapers, there are not only no shocking stories, but not even particularly stimulating news. However, even in this peaceful atmosphere, there are things worth reporting: the provincial authorities have recently been actively planning and promoting various measures related to public order, food supply, and transportation.

Allowing Bandits to Surrender

Complete Extermination After the Deadline

Let's talk about public order first. In the past, before the CCP armed forces had withdrawn, many local bandits claimed to be affiliated with the CCP, which greatly hindered the government's efforts to suppress banditry. Moreover, the CCP leaders have stated that there are no more communist troops in Guangdong, which naturally makes bandit suppression in the province much smoother. Therefore, the authorities decided on a province-wide pacification plan. During the pacification period, bandits would be allowed to surrender. If they remain unrepentant after the deadline, large-scale searches and exterminations would be carried out by district. These operations would be the responsibility of the National Army and security forces stationed in the area. At the same time, orders were given to establish special agencies in each extermination zone to implement rural cleansing work, improve the Baojia system, and distribute weapons and ammunition to strengthen the people's self-defense forces. Director Zhang Fakui of the Command Headquarters personally inspected the northeast in the past month and designated the counties in each extermination zone: the inter-provincial area between Guangdong, Hunan, and Jiangxi included seven counties in Guangdong: Heping, Lianping, Nanxiong, Wengyuan, Shixing, Qujiang, and Renhua; two counties in Hunan: Guidong and Rucheng; and ten counties in Jiangxi: Nankang, Xinfeng, Anyuan, Xunwu, Jiudu, Longnan, and Dayu. Within this area, each administrative district would form a rural cleansing supervisory committee composed of party, government, and military leaders and local gentry, and each county would form a rural cleansing work group. The Guangdong-Fujian-Jiangxi border area would focus on the areas around Jiaoling, Pingyuan, Dabu, Raoping, Yongding, Shanghang, and Shaoan, and a Han River Cleansing Committee would be established in the East River area, with the county magistrates serving as members responsible for cleansing. As for Qiongya (Hainan Island), it could be said to be the area with the most rampant banditry, with an estimated four thousand bandits gathered there. Provincial Chairman Luo, accompanied by Deputy Commander of the Security Forces Wei Zhenfu, visited Qiongya for inspection and convened a pacification meeting. Recently, it was decided to send additional security forces to the area for encirclement and suppression, and a Qiongya Command Post of the Security Headquarters would be established, with Deputy Commander Wei Zhenfu serving as commander, while also supporting local civilian armed forces to assist. It is estimated that the total armed force can be increased by 20,000 after the reorganization of civilian armed forces throughout the province. This pacification plan is scheduled to begin on August 1st, with a deadline of two months to eliminate the remaining bandits. It is believed that after this thorough suppression of bandits, the security of Guangdong province will be further consolidated.

Forming an Administrative Supervision Group

Inspecting the Actual Situation in Various Places

Regarding provincial administration, the most important task is the establishment of an administrative supervision group by the provincial government last month. Led by members of the provincial government, personnel from the four departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, Construction, and Education, as well as the Land and Food Bureau, would depart for seven districts to conduct supervision. Their tasks are: (1) Focusing on past tax collection and providing guidance for the operation of the new financial system in the future. (2) Supervising the preparation work for the collection of land tax in kind. (3) Assessing the current state of the local Baojia system and improving its organization. (4) Repairing highway transportation. (5) Assessing the progress of relief work. (6) Assessing the current state of relief and education and the methods for improvement and promotion in the future. (7) Maintaining public order and civilian self-defense forces. (8) The current status of various prohibitions. In addition to these eight items, they will also investigate corruption and the general economic and social trends of the area. Starting from the 15th of last month, the supervision groups in each district have departed one after another.

Increased Grain Production Next Year

Self-Sufficiency is Expected

As for the grain issue in this province, many people are probably concerned. As reported last time by the reporter, the rice shortage crisis in this province seems to have been safely overcome. However, this province is still a grain-deficient province, and this year, the uneven rainfall has affected the harvest significantly, and investigations in various rivers show that there is no bumper harvest. According to statistics, the total amount of grain needed in the province in the second half of the year is about 15 million dan. Although, in terms of short-term measures, the authorities have already taken measures such as purchasing rice from other provinces to aid Guangdong, storing rural grains for famine relief, and continuing to promote conservation. However, these measures can probably only solve the problem for this year. But if we want to be self-sufficient in the future, the fundamental thing is still to promote farmland irrigation and actively cultivate wasteland to increase production. Therefore, this item is listed as the most important task in the province's five-year plan. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry is actively planning this. Recently, it borrowed 180,000 yuan from the Agricultural Bank of China for the need to build water conservancy projects and irrigate fields in various places, and urged various counties to strictly implement the "One Bao, One Pond" movement. At the same time, according to the report, 314 barrels of seeds have been shipped, and 2,000 tons of fertilizer have arrived in Kowloon. This province is expected to receive 15,000 tons of fertilizer, which will be shipped and applied successively. As for the pesticide powder, part of it has also arrived. In addition, there are 1,500 sets of agricultural tools on the way to Guangdong... If this report is credible, then it will be of great help to increase grain production. It is estimated that at most next year, the grain in this province will be self-sufficient, and no longer need to rely on foreign countries!

Proposed Repair of Main Highway Lines

Approximately 8,000 Kilometers

Finally, it is worth mentioning the current state of transportation construction in this province. In terms of railways, the Guangzhou-Kowloon, Guangzhou-Sanshui, and Guangdong-Hankou railways have all resumed traffic. At present, the authorities believe that the most important task in transportation is the restoration of the main highway lines in the province. It is estimated that the province originally had 14,518 kilometers of highways, and after the wartime damage, only 417 kilometers of passable roads remained, which is less than one thirty-fifth of the original. Due to inconvenient transportation, this has a great impact on the economic construction of the province. According to the plan of the Highway Bureau, a total of 8,200 kilometers of highways should be repaired, including 3,970.7 kilometers of main lines connecting the province's important cities and towns, 2,927.9 kilometers of lines connecting international ports, and 1,321.6 kilometers of main lines connecting other provinces. However, because the project is huge and requires a total of 42,385,107,797 yuan in construction funds, and the central government's subsidies have not yet been allocated immediately, in order to meet the urgent needs of reconstruction, it is only possible to first repair the main transportation sections with available financial resources to restore traffic. The main highway lines that have been repaired are Guangzhou-Shaoguan, Guanxing, Shaoyu, Xiongxin, Guangzeng, Denghebo, Meishan, Wengqian, and Shaoxiao. According to Xie Delong Wenlong, Director of the Department of Construction, the provincial treasury is unable to provide enough funds, and the central government has not provided much subsidy. In the future, it is planned to support merchants to build the two major east-west highways on the coast of this province, with Guangzhou as the center point. The west line will go through Foshan, Jiangmen, Heshan, Enping, Taishan, Yangjiang, Dianbai, Shuidong, and end at Haian City, the southernmost end of the Leizhou Peninsula. The east line will go from this city through Dongguan, Huiyang, Haifeng, Lufeng, Kuitan, Huilai, and other places to Shantou, and then go out to Fujian. Some sections of these two highways are already open to traffic, and some sections have already been prepared. The current promotion of construction is only to ensure that they can be connected to each other. From this point of view, the highway transportation in this province will have considerable progress in a short period of time.

Social Services

### Answering Readers' Legal Questions

(1) Han Xueqi asks: Your department handles social service affairs, answers various questions free of charge, and provides convenience to readers, which is admirable. The reason is that I deposited 200 yuan of savings accumulated from my hard work into the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank for a ten-year fixed savings in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934). The term has long expired, but it is still repaid according to the original number of foreign currency at the legal tender rate. At a time when prices have exceeded pre-war levels by thousands of times, the hundreds of yuan received are equivalent to zero. May I ask: I think I am not the only small depositor of this kind (Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng had a proposal on the above question at the Second Plenary Session, which was explained in detail. Your newspaper also published it, but no resolution was published.) Does the government have any regulations for the return of the above savings to form its own method, and whether the government has referred to the price index and increased any multiple of repayment? Or are there any actual cases of legal judgments of this kind of dispute that can be used as a reference? It concerns the interests of a large number of working-class depositors. Please give us a clear indication.

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] Reference should be made to those who supplement the fairness of litigation after restoration. The court should make a fair judgment and increase or decrease the payment. (2) Chen Jinglei asks Editor: Readers Shi Di Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding, four people, the inheritance of their late father should be equally divided into four shares, but because the Shi Di are scattered during the war, it has not been analyzed yet, and Jia is temporarily in charge. Within a few years, Jia will first allocate all public property to Jia's account, and then sell it off one after another. When Yi Bingding returns from the rear, they are in a homeless place. I would like to ask you to answer the questions. (1) Jia has sold all of the late father's inheritance, which has not yet been analyzed. Are the various contracts signed by the business operator and Jia all valid? (2) Jia changed the name of the public property to Jia's account, and Jia sold it in person. Are the contracts signed valid? (3) If the business operator has arrived at the household, can Yi Bingding sue the court to recover the property rights? (4) If the business operator has not arrived at the household, can Yi Bingding hire a lawyer to post in the local newspaper, declaring it invalid, and notify the business operator in writing to request it within a deadline? (5) The business operator and the land are located in Changxing, Zhejiang, and Yi Bingding are all from Yixing, Jiangsu. Can they file a lawsuit in Xuanhe court and transfer jurisdiction without having to go to Changxing to sue? (6) Yi Bingding has asked the local district town office gentlemen to mediate several times, but the business operator ignores them. Can they be sent to the local authorities to transfer to the Yixing court for prosecution, which is relatively simple?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) Invalid (2) Invalid (3) You can sue to recover property rights (4) Yes (5) You should file a lawsuit in the court where the real estate is located, because it is an exclusive jurisdiction and you cannot request a change. (6) Since mediation is ineffective, a lawsuit should be filed in the Changxing District Court of Zhejiang.

(3) Yin Xizhi of Yixing asks: "There is a pavilion, please give instructions: "There is a building, the downstairs belongs to B, and the second floor belongs to A. It was destroyed by war during the Anti-Japanese War. Can Party A now have the right to require Party B to fulfill the old contract and rebuild it?"

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] You can request Party B to fulfill the original contract.

### Dredging or Filling of Tudui and Stinky Hamlets: Explanation from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works

Regarding the article "Tudui and Stinky Hamlets Should Be Filled Within a Time Limit" published in the social service column of your newspaper on July 30, we hereby reply as follows: After investigation, there are many waterways in this city that are used to discharge ditch water. Therefore, we are currently investigating the various rivers and hamlets, and selecting those related to drainage to dredge them as much as possible within the scope of financial burden (such as Fahua Hamlet, Zhaojiabang Hamlet, and Zhuanan Hamlet have been deepened) to make the water flow smoothly. Those that are irrelevant to drainage and can be filled will be filled in as soon as they are completed. If they cannot be filled without burying pipes, they can only be handled in phases depending on the severity of the situation due to financial constraints. However, residents near the rivers and hamlets must not dump garbage and feces to pay attention to hygiene. As for the Tudui problem, it is now under the management of the Hygiene Bureau and is reported separately for filling or elimination. Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works.

### The Urgent Need to Resolve the Land Problem in Northern Jiangsu

— Ge Kexin

Since the end of the war against Japan, Northern Jiangsu has not seen a single day of true peace, even as the first anniversary of the victory approaches. Initially, there were only the National Revolutionary Army and the enemy forces. Gradually, countless guerrilla bands emerged, and then the "New Fourth Army" arose. Later, the guerrillas, unable to withstand the joint attacks from the enemy and the "New Fourth Army," eventually transformed into puppet troops in some cases. The National Revolutionary Army faced off against the enemy, guerrilla bands encroached upon each other, and the "New Fourth Army" fought with both guerrilla bands and the National Revolutionary Army. The National Revolutionary Army, isolated in Northern Jiangsu and lacking external supplies, had to rely on the local population for provisions. The enemy, adhering to the principle of "using war to sustain war," constantly requisitioned military grain. Surrendered troops, feigning allegiance, sought food and supplies. The "New Fourth Army" also extracted what they called "public grain" from the common people. Aside from the various disturbances and losses suffered during battles, these frequent and diverse burdens undoubtedly squeezed the last drop of blood from every farmer in Northern Jiangsu! However, under powerful oppression, and especially for the sake of the sacred national war, the farmers of Northern Jiangsu silently endured. Who knew that after victory, they would face even more widespread and cruel disasters than before?

The "New Fourth Army" in Northern Jiangsu clearly gained a foothold and grew stronger by taking advantage of the wartime chaos and certain undeniable political weaknesses. After the "New Fourth Army" expanded, the entire Northern Jiangsu region, except for a few "points" with relatively convenient transportation, seemed to have been occupied and controlled by it, taken separately from the National Revolutionary Army, guerrilla bands, puppet troops, and even surrendered enemies. They strengthened "struggles" and introduced some so-called "great turnaround" measures. Slogans and punishments that confused people are set aside for the moment. What needs to be specifically pointed out is the changes imposed on the land by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Northern Jiangsu.

Regardless of the CCP's labels—whether "liquidation," "rent reduction," "grain fines," or confiscation of the property of traitors, "quasi-traitors," and "traitor descendants"—they ultimately cannot conceal the predatory and violent changes imposed on the land. I agree with any scholar or party that holds the ideal of land redistribution, but I firmly oppose the CCP's approach in Northern Jiangsu. A few days ago, Madame Sun Song Qingling, in her opinion on the current situation, stated, "The Principle of People's Livelihood today means that the people can no longer suffer from hunger," with "the land problem must be reasonably resolved" and "the Kuomintang must fulfill its historical mission—land reform." No one can deny that she is right; however, in the actual implementation of land reform, the Kuomintang and the CCP have significant differences in methods. The CCP's approach in Northern Jiangsu is neither "supporting the Three Principles of the People" nor implementing communism. Its so-called land revolution, at least in the current stage, is merely a means to achieve some other objective. If Madame Sun Song Qingling could recognize this fact, I think she would have some new feelings, sympathize with the "Northern Jiangsu refugees" who have been driven out, and certainly believe that these "people" whose right to survival has been denied by the CCP should also "have the right to rise up against hunger."

I will not debate the responsibility for the current turmoil in Northern Jiangsu. I want to discuss the fact that the current military situation in Northern Jiangsu is rapidly changing, accompanied by inevitable political changes, and the most important point is undoubtedly the handling of the land problem. Over the past few years, the land in Northern Jiangsu under the control of the CCP has obviously undergone some changes. Confiscations have been carried out, and distributions have been made. When this issue comes into our hands, we must ask: What should be done?

The CCP's measures regarding land in Northern Jiangsu can be explained in the following points:

(1) Land confiscated without compensation is resold to farmers. – As mentioned earlier, the CCP has confiscated a lot of land. For the original landlords, they are given a crime, but no other compensation is provided. Then, the land is resold to some people. I wonder if those who are not CCP members or not involved in "militia" "military relatives" have no right to buy or do they not dare to ask about it? Because, according to what we know, few honest farmers really buy such land. As for the sale price of these lands, there is no fixed standard. The compensation paid by the buyer goes entirely to the CCP. However, there are also those who get land without paying a price, which is naturally used by the CCP as "granted land."

(2) Landlords are forced to sell land in the name of "grain fines." – The so-called landlords, who have long been harassed and exploited, have already reached the end of their rope. Today, there is a "rent reduction," and tomorrow, there is a "liquidation." As a result, they are ordered to "fine grain" to get things done. After receiving the order, the landlords have to hand over the amount of grain stipulated by the order. Therefore, they have to sell their land at a low price and buy enough food at a high price to fill the fine. In this way, it is like a sharp pair of scissors, forcing the poor landlords to continuously sell land at a low price until they sell out or can only retain three to five acres. But there are two situations that must be explained: (A) When the landlords find a buyer, mediate through intermediaries, and sign a contract for sale, this is relatively fair. (B) When the CCP "cadres" or members dictate the price, the landlords have no room for bargaining. It goes without saying that the landlords will suffer losses. Regardless of which of the above methods or purchase and sale cooperation is used, because of the transfer of ownership, the buyer must complete the tax deed formalities. The price is well-known.

(3) Distribution by population – This is a new method that has only been in place since February of this year, and it is less practiced in areas such as Rugao, Taixing, and Jingjiang. We cannot penetrate deeply into the CCP-controlled areas, so we have no way of knowing the details.

If we acknowledge the above as facts, it is not difficult to come to the conclusion: First, according to communism, private land ownership is not recognized. However, in Northern Jiangsu, except for the third point, where the details are unknown and cannot be speculated, the remaining points (1) and (2) both involve buying and selling behavior, which is certainly a definite confirmation of private ownership. The reason why it takes such measures. According to my personal observation, nothing comes out of the following points: (1) Striving for materials, (2) Striving for poor farmers, (3) Encouraging land production; Second, although the CCP's motive for taking such measures is not centered on solving the land problem, the result induces a tendency to decentralize land rights. One side disperses private land ownership. On one side, the number of people who own land private ownership naturally increases.

Speaking of dealing with the land problem in the communist region, the government has existing regulations to follow: One is the "Regulations on the Handling of Rural Land in Various Provinces in the Bandit Suppression Area," which was previously implemented in the provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi; the other is the "Provisional Method for Granting Land by Population" of the Western Fujian Post-Disaster Committee. Solving the same problem with different methods is due to the fact that the system is suitable for the time and place. Western Fujian was originally a place with many You and few people. After a long period of war, there were even fewer people, and most of the landlords were killed and massacred at that time, so that there were many ownerless farmland afterwards, and there was a situation of "there is land but no one to cultivate." Therefore, it was decided to implement land granting according to the population, with less resistance and implying encouragement of birth and growth. From a historical lesson, granting land according to the population has little hope of success. The "Equal Field System" of the Northern Wei Dynasty and the "Handen System" of the Taika Reform in Japan are all failed precedents. Not only are there many difficulties during the reform, but the main difficulty is that after several years, farmland may not have increased much, while the population has increased year by year. This change in proportion will inevitably cause the original plan to be completely shaken again. The topography, population, and CCP's actions in Northern Jiangsu are different from those in Western Fujian, and granting land by population is not a good way, so no matter how granting land by population is implemented in Western Fujian, I don't want to advocate its implementation in Northern Jiangsu.

Secondly, speaking of the "Regulations on the Handling of Rural Land in Various Provinces in the Bandit Suppression Area," according to the main points of the regulations:

(1) All farmland and other real estate should be returned to the original owners in principle;

(2) Set the maximum amount of private farmland, and levy income tax on the land rent collected on the excess farmland at a progressive rate;

(3) Where land has been divided by the Communist Party, establish rural revival committees at all levels, sputum utensils are everywhere. Guide tenant farmers to cultivate and agricultural owners to form cooperatives, and transfer the public land and land rent managed by the committee to the cooperative for management;

(4) The national land whose boundaries have been destroyed may be re-marked after mutual recognition by the owners' meeting, and the scattered and fragmented farmland may be reorganized;

(5) For farmland and official wasteland whose ownership has not been determined, land is granted according to the population, and a quota is set, but the owners have priority;

(6) The rent amount is determined by the rural revival committee, and the owners shall not freely increase the rent or withdraw the land.

First, in the first point, we still recognize the existence of private land ownership, so we naturally agree with this principle. However, based on this principle to deal with the land problem in Northern Jiangsu, there are several points that must be discussed separately: (1) Except for the land confiscated by the CCP that is clearly the property of enemies and puppets and should be confiscated according to law, the rest should be returned to the original owners. It would be no problem to take back some of the land that the CCP has used as "rewards" and allocated. The problem is that the buyers have paid a considerable price to the CCP. Although the government can order that all these transactions are invalid, in order to be considerate of the buyers, my personal opinion is that buyers who do not exceed a certain amount and are indeed self-cultivated should be treated differently from those who buy more than a certain amount and do not use it all for self-cultivation. It is better to take back those who exceed a certain amount free of charge and return them to the original owners; for the rest of the self-cultivated countries, it is best to come up with a remedy. I certainly know that remedies are very difficult and few, but we shouldn't be afraid of difficulties. Even if the rescue is very small, it is better than no remedy at all. (2) When landlords sell land, no matter what the reason for the sale, as long as the sale is mediated and a contract is signed, this behavior is relatively fair, and we should recognize its legality. We sincerely advocate returning to the original owners in principle, but the above circumstances should be treated as exceptions. (3) If the sale was forced by the CCP to lower the price, although it is not sound from a legal point of view, the buyer is not necessarily designated by the CCP. If it is not recognized, it is clearly a disregard for the interests of third parties. Based on the teachings of our national father Sun Yat-sen and the declaration of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang, we advocate that those who have such circumstances should also be recognized in principle, but in order to compensate the landlord's losses and fairness, the buyer should be ordered to make up the amount according to the fair price at that time.

Regarding the second point, that is, setting the maximum amount of private land and levying income tax on the land rent of the excess land at a progressive rate. This is a policy of mild land reform implemented by means of high tax rates. Although we have no objection in principle, it must be clarified if it is applied to Northern Jiangsu. Originally, the so-called large landlords in Northern Jiangsu have different fertility levels, and the Xuhai area is different from the Tongru Huaiyang area. The soil in Tongru Huaiyang is more fertile (in fact, it can be said that the whole problem is water), and the number of landlords with more than 1,000 acres is very small. Usually, owning two or three hundred acres of land can be regarded as a wealthy person. The Xuhai area is different. The soil there is relatively barren. Owning thousands of acres of land is not considered rich. To be called a wealthy person, you must have tens of thousands of acres or even tens of thousands of acres. I know that the Qin and Ma families in Shuyang used to be like this. Therefore, when setting the maximum amount, if the maximum amount of private land is stipulated from 100 acres to 200 acres according to the land processing regulations of the three provinces, it can be applied to the Huaiyang notification and not be applied to Xuhai. Furthermore, judging from the actual situation during these disturbances, landlords who left their hometowns earlier sold less land, because they only sold some property for the living expenses of "living as a guest," which is very different from those who started to flee after the victory. Landlords who fled in the past year have experienced a long period of struggle. If they do not flee or cannot escape, they have to deal with reality. If they do not admit the fine, they are afraid of confiscation, so they have to sell a little and save a little. Such people account for the absolute majority of the refugees. Taking the counties of Tongru as an example, there are very few "refugees" who can retain more than one or two hundred acres by the time they flee. After this turmoil, it can also be said that after this lesson, many people's thinking has changed. They understand that the life of "clothes tax and food rent" is unreasonable, and they also know that the best way to curb the CCP's activities is to stabilize the lives of poor farmers. Under such circumstances, it is precisely the opportunity to promote our ideal land policy. In addition to setting the maximum amount of private land and levying income tax on the land rent of the excess land at a progressive rate, I don't know if the government can issue land bonds to purchase a part of those that are excessively excess. There are also those who advocate changing the progressive tax rate to thoroughly implement the two-five rent reduction, which is specially attached here for the reference of those who study this issue.

Regarding the third and fourth points, in addition to the establishment of rural and revival committees at all levels as administrative issues, the remaining issues, such as organizing rural utilization cooperatives and re-marking the boundaries of the destroyed national land, and reorganizing the scattered and fragmented farmland, are all issues related to the land itself. My friend Mr. Ge Luowu is a landlord who comes from a rural area and has struggled in the communist region for five years. During these five years, he has been studying the land problem. According to his view. The ideal of a rural cooperative is certainly good, but there are indeed problems with the talents who run the cooperative, as well as problems with the traditional habits and knowledge of farmers. Therefore, the results of the cooperative are often contrary to Hui Xiang. Therefore, he believes that only after twenty years, when the general public has made progress, can rural cooperation be done well. I propose to run a demonstration farm in each county, and the scale of this farm must be quite large. Doesn't the Xingzong have agricultural machinery? Aren't there technical guidance? It is very difficult to find a large piece of land on a normal day, but it is much more convenient at this time. In addition to official wasteland, public land, and ownerless land, it can also be requisitioned, purchased, straightened, and exchanged. If it is low, there is a machine to make it high; if it is high, there is a machine to make it low. The benefits of agricultural mechanization and scientific production, let the farmers see this demonstration farm, see Tongling with their own eyes, and touch it. Is our wish for the countryside just to revive it?

Regarding the fifth and sixth points, I feel that it is also a good way to protect the rights of tenants and prevent landlords from arbitrarily increasing rents. Nantung County has a total of about 3 million acres of cultivated land and a population of about 1.5 million. Assuming that each family has five members, each family has ten acres, and the estimated current value based on the output is about 1 million yuan. After deducting costs such as fertilization of about 500,000 yuan, the income is about 500,000 yuan. The average monthly living expenses for each person are 8,000 yuan. How can they survive? It all depends on sideline occupations. However, tenant farming requires an additional expense for rent. In other words, the income of tenant farmers is lower than that of self-cultivating farmers. Therefore, when setting the quota for granting land, the above-mentioned example of Nantong is of great reference value. In order to maintain the minimum living standard of tenant farmers, according to the situation in Nantong, each person must be granted at least two to three acres, and each family of five must have at least ten to fifteen acres. Nantong has an industrial base, and hand-weaving is even more common in villages, so the lives of Nantong farmers are generally good. The situation in Xuhai is not right. The soil is thin, the yield is small, and the sideline occupations are far less prosperous than in Tongru Huaiyang. When dealing with land in Northern Jiangsu, I think it is impossible to apply a fixed method rigidly to all counties.

To revive the countryside and improve the lives of farmers, it is not enough to rely on the system alone. Water conservancy, production technology, transportation, finance, etc., all have a very significant relationship and mutually influence each other. People think that as long as the system is reformed, the requirements for improving the lives of farmers can be met. Isn't that too simple? The discussion in this article is not beyond the scope of the system, and I am a layman on land issues. However, I am from Northern Jiangsu, so I naturally care about the core strength of Northern Jiangsu. Northern Jiangsu has developed into a new situation, and reality cannot be avoided. Therefore, I do not hesitate to be protected by those who know, and rudely say what I want to say. As for correct opinions and methods, I hope experts will come up with them soon.

### The Suffering of Slaves

— Tao Xiong

After watching "Spring Cold"

The Shanghai Experimental Theater Troupe's performance of "Spring Cold" this time is much more meaningful than its first performance of "The New Official Takes Office." "The New Official Takes Office" only wrote about a group of shameless hooligans bullying the common people by relying on the power of violent enemies; while "Spring Cold" wrote about the cunning and insidiousness of people's hearts; and how good people are tempted by the environment and become opportunistic; an inexperienced and pure woman cannot resist the drive of her own fantasies and the outside world taking honor as bait, causing her to have a nightmare and almost completely destroy herself.

"Spring Cold" deeply reveals the evil nature of human beings, making us shudder; deeply afraid of the rugged path of life, and the traps set by evil wolves and poisonous snakes in the darkness, wanting to devour us good and pure people, how terrible this is!

As long as we uncover the layer of story covering "Spring Cold," we can find more things inside. These things are endless, eternal, and also the ugly character often seen in today's society, and the conspiracies that may occur in any dark corner.

"Spring Cold," "Spring" is still "Cold"! My Lord! In which season will you give us warmth?

### The Music I Love

— Li Qinghua

The young composer Mr. Zhang Dinghe composed many pieces during the Anti-Japanese War and has recently arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing. It is said that the Shanghai Municipal Government Symphony Orchestra and the Shanghai Municipal Music Association will hold a concert of his personal works this month. I am writing this article as an introduction.

I am a person of very stubborn preferences.

I like to have all-night conversations with friends on cold, lonely winter nights. I love to read short lyric poems. I like freehand brushwork paintings with two or three strokes. I love Chekhov's plays... Well, it's the same with music. I prefer the gentle and melancholy violin solos and the short songs that seem to sob and complain.

In fact, my relationship with music, even now, is like meeting a stranger. Although many music lovers have introduced me to it with great sincerity, I can only grasp a little of its appearance. When listening to music, although I sometimes pretend to be a connoisseur by closing my eyes and appreciating it, only a few fragments can occasionally melt into my heart.

I remember that the medium through which I became acquainted with music was He Luting's "The Cowherd's Flute." At that time, I was studying in a small town surrounded by green mountains. Outside the school gate were farmhouses and pastures. During our spare time, the school's surroundings were where we found spiritual rest. One day, the school held a concert—the only one in that secluded small town—and the only program I could accept was "The Cowherd's Flute." Because when this piece was played, I felt as if I were taking a walk on the fields outside the school. To this day, whenever I think of this piece, the scenery around the school appears before my eyes.

Perhaps it is due to my living environment and the habits I have developed, but I don't particularly like large, rapid movements, but rather tranquil and beautiful small pieces. I like gentle violin pieces, and sometimes the first note can tightly grip my heartstrings. A few minutes of singing can make me daydream for a whole day. With music like this, I sometimes feel like I'm not listening to a performance, but listening to a young girl expressing her feelings, or a melancholy whisper. I don't like passionate love songs, but I often indulge in short songs full of tender feelings. I don't like loud and mournful elegies, but I yearn for that lingering taste.

Therefore, among many composers, I also prefer composers who are good at writing lyrical short songs. Among Chinese famous composers, Mr. Huang Zi's works are what I like. At the same time, the pieces of his talented student Mr. Zhang Dinghe are also what I prefer. Mr. Zhang is good at writing lyrical short songs, and the mood of his pieces is exactly the mood that I have always been accustomed to and preferred.

The first time I heard Mr. Zhang Dinghe's song was "Song of Exile," which was also around the time when "On the Songhua River" was widely popular. Perhaps it was because I was in exile in a foreign land at the time, but these two songs were almost always on my lips. In 1939, I sang them from Sichuan to Shaanxi, and in 1940, I sang them back from Shaanxi to Sichuan, "...Past events are like smoke, home mountains are like dreams, where is the way home? The same crescent moon, different moods, travelers are even more heartbroken..." These few sentences added much sorrow and bitterness to my daily life, but also gave me much remembrance and comfort.

Mr. Guo Moruo's "The Flowers of Brotherhood" achieved unexpected success during its first performance in Chongqing. The rich plot in the script was certainly liked by the audience. However, Mr. Zhang Dinghe's several interlude songs can also be said to be a major factor contributing to the success of the performance. Those who watched the performance at the Anti-Japanese Construction Hall back then must have felt the same way. Those interludes fully expressed the emotions and atmosphere of the entire play. In China, there are already very few excellent writers of drama interludes, and Mr. Zhang is not only an excellent writer in this regard, but he has also written a large number of interludes for many plays. In addition to "The Flowers of Brotherhood," the interludes for "The Thunderstorm," "Ode to Righteousness," "Yue Fei," "Setting an Example," "Border Town Story," and many other plays were very popular in the rear areas. Even four- and five-year-old children loved to sing them. Mr. Zhang's contribution to the production of drama interludes is indelible. It is a pity that in recent years he has rarely composed for dramas. Perhaps I am not the only one who considers it a pity!

Well, there is no need for me to introduce him any further. Fortunately, Mr. Zhang's pieces are familiar to everyone in the rear areas, and there are many, many people who like his pieces. In Shanghai, Mr. Zhang may be very unfamiliar, but I believe that he will surely become a familiar composer to everyone in the future.

I am not a connoisseur, and I am even less accustomed to using any theories to measure everything. I like to talk about my personal preferences, and I especially like to stubbornly stick to my own preferences. On the occasion of Mr. Zhang's works being performed, I hope there will be a few people who, like me, prefer his pieces.

(Editor's note: The Zhang Dinghe Works Concert is scheduled to be held at the Yiyuan on the evening of the 22nd of this month.)

### Popular Western Films: Introducing Three of the Most Beautiful Works

— Xin Ming

In recent years, Hollywood's Western historical films have been quite popular, so various companies are also trying their best to produce them in order to meet the public's expectations. For example, Republic Pictures actually makes Western films its main product. Their box-office power is no less than that of musicals, mythical palace dramas, etc. Because in every Western film, there is always an unparalleled hero and thrilling sword fights, gunfights, fistfights, and great war scenes, etc., which are what most children, teenagers, and young people admire and like the most. Therefore, Hollywood companies, because of the amazing box-office success of Western films, spare no expense to devote themselves to shooting them. Many Western films have been completed this year, and three of the most complete and beautiful are selected for introduction below:

(1) "San Antonio" starring Errol Flynn. His acting skills, agile horsemanship, skillful swordsmanship, and marksmanship are all well-known and have long been popular. The heroine is not the old partner Olivia de Havilland, but the new star Alexis Smith. The whole film is brilliantly colored and produced by Warner Bros.

(2) "Virginian" is adapted from the famous novel by novelist Owen Wister, starring Joel McCrea. We have been away from his films for a long time, and he has an excellent performance in this film. Others include Sonny Tufts, Brian Donlevy, etc. Barbara Britton from "The Spiritualist" plays the heroine. The stampede of cattle herds in the middle of the night and the galloping of outlaws after sunset are full of colorful shots in this film. It is a very valuable epic produced by Paramount Pictures.

(3) "Smoky" This is a Western story written by Will James twenty years ago, which depicts an untamed, stubborn horse named Smoky. Now, 20th Century Fox has made it into a beautiful and moving colorful Western film, starring Fred MacMurray and Anne Baxter.

### "House of Loyalty and Righteousness"

— Yu Fu

The film "House of Loyalty and Righteousness," produced by the Second Factory of the Central Film Studio and directed by Wu Yonggang, was shown to the press and cultural circles on the morning of the 5th. Since then, the opinions and criticisms of the film in various newspapers and drama publications have been quite different. What is even more ridiculous is that a critic suggested adding a little story between Pu Zhendong and Hua Xinpei (played by Yan Su and Qin Yi). What is this so-called "story" referring to? Is it based on character or plot? If we add a "story" according to the American film style, that would be very interesting, wouldn't it?

Any work must be criticized, otherwise, its artistic value cannot be evaluated and known.

Any artist must be able to withstand criticism; at the same time, the attitude of any critic must be benevolent, and the viewpoint must be correct. If a critic has a malicious attitude and a distorted viewpoint, then does he still want people to accept his criticism and his opinions? This is a very obvious thing, isn't it!

### Hollywood's Far East Market

— Ying Dai

After the end of the war, Hollywood film companies have been doing their best to restore the film industry to normal as quickly as possible. On the one hand, they are recruiting talents and rushing to make new films; on the other hand, they are paying attention to the overseas market and how to promote it. Therefore, in the past year, they have successively sent personnel to various overseas regions to investigate the changes in the film industry after the war in order to provide a reference for market promotion. In the Far East, the largest market for American films should be Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Manila. Therefore, large companies such as Paramount, MGM, Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox, etc., have all sent personnel to the East to investigate everything and compete for supremacy.

In the past year, the business competition of Hollywood film companies in the Far East has indeed been quite fierce. Taking Shanghai as an example, the films they have brought in are mostly masterpieces, such as those produced in 1944 and 1945 that have won the Academy Awards for Film Art and Sciences, which have also been brought in for public screenings one after another. As far as the Hollywood films we have seen, there are indeed many old films, but they are all better productions. And the screening period of films in Shanghai cinemas recently is longer than before the war. All the epics will be screened for several weeks. It is estimated that this trend will continue to be maintained in the coming year and will not change.

Not only in the Far East, but also in major cities around the world after the end of the war, the film industry has experienced high development. In this situation, Hollywood film companies must increase their production volume, because not only are there more cinemas in general cities than before the war, but also the audience is more enthusiastic than in the past. However, on the contrary, Hollywood film companies have produced fewer films in the past year than before the war, but the quality has been improved uniformly. No matter the cast, set design, photography, or editing, there has been progress in all aspects. This is of course also the only reason why a new film can be screened for several weeks in a row.

### Talking About the Beijing Opera Actors of "Tianchan"

— Feng Chang

The Tianchan Stage went through several twists and turns before inviting the Beijing opera actor Hu Shaoan to the South. His opening play at Tianchan was "Si Lang Visits His Mother," and his name was even placed before Zhang Yunxi's in the introduction. This made the people of Shanghai dazzled and unable to guess what kind of person he was. So Hu Shaoan attracted the attention of the opera fans.

This attention was short-lived. After listening to his performances several times, the medicine sold in the gourd was exposed. Hu Shaoan was simply not as good as Wang Tiexia.

The elderly Beijing opera actors who came to Shanghai from the North were unlucky. Not counting those in the distant past, those in recent times such as Sha Shixin, Wang Wenyuan, Guo Chunyang, Xu Dongming, and Wang Tiexia were all without voices and were not welcomed by the people of Shanghai. As a result, they returned in disappointment.

Sha Shixin once missed a line on stage and bowed to the audience, which of course was a failure.

Wang Wenyuan once sang Old Commander Yang of Li Lingbei without carrying a tombstone, because Xun Huisheng was about to appear on stage and urged him to go down earlier, but the audience did not want a refund for his hasty ending.

Guo Chunyang took the lead for one day, but could not continue because his voice was ruined, so he gave Ji Yuliang a chance to replace him.

Xu Dongming's performance was slightly better than Guo Chunyang's, but he relied mostly on Zhou Weijun's Lu Wenlong's fighting in "The Eight Great Hammers."

Wang Tiexia, that was not long ago. His appearance and stage presence were good, and some people called him the "Western Style Elderly Actor," but his singing lacked charm, and the audience shook their heads at him, saying he was the most hopeless elderly actor.

This time Hu Shaoan came, and everyone expected him to be better than Wang Tiexia, but in fact it was the opposite. Hu Shaoan was not as good as Wang Tiexia. In terms of appearance, the two were in the same boat. In terms of voice, Wang Tiexia was not good, but at least it was consistent from beginning to end, while Hu Shaoan had two voices, high and low. When it was high, it could be compared to Song Baoluo, but it was only a high note at any time, and what followed it would definitely be terribly low, so low that even the people singing on the same stage could not hear it. Of course, the low voice accounted for more than 90 percent. In terms of martial arts, he was terribly loose. In terms of singing skills, no matter what you do, you will not be welcomed with this kind of voice. So I said that misfortune would soon befall Hu Shaoan.

### Love Story

— Qian Fanfu

Zhou Xueshi regarded his young maternal uncle as his best friend. His uncle often explained difficult parts of his textbooks and taught him various simple and interesting games. Xueshi's favorite game was having his uncle toss him into the air and then catch him in his palms. He never considered how dangerous this game was; he trusted those strong arms as deeply as he loved his uncle.

Returning home from school, Xueshi threw his satchel on a chair and loudly called out, "Uncle! Uncle!" He was ready to continue the fun from the night before.

Usually, he would easily receive a loud, hearty response, but today, he called three or four times, and still, there was no reply. It was rare for his uncle to go out at this hour. Feeling surprised, he walked into his uncle's bedroom.

Xueshi happened to see his uncle's back. He was sitting alone in a chair with a backrest, his right arm extended, his hand seemingly holding a small object, a jade piece of green and white, emitting a gleam. His uncle seemed to be gazing at it intently, not noticing the footsteps behind him. When his nephew came into view, he quickly clenched his right hand into a fist and put it in his pocket.

"Uncle, why didn't you answer me just now? Shall we go outside to play for a while?"

The two, one a young man of twenty-eight, the other a child of nine, went to the courtyard together. After suggesting some new games, Xueshi again clamored for his uncle to do the one where he threw him into the air.

Once, twice… Xueshi's body rose into the air, higher than his uncle's head, one time even reaching the height of a two-story building. They played happily, neither feeling tired.

Suddenly, something bright and exquisite fell from his uncle's pocket to the ground with a clatter. Lying on the cement floor was a jade goose of green and white, one of its wings broken.

His uncle's face immediately showed a look of panic and bewilderment. Only when Xueshi's body fell from mid-air did he remember to quickly reach out to catch him, nearly missing him. Xueshi thought to himself: this could be considered a dangerous game.

Before Xueshi could steady himself, he saw his uncle rush over, carefully picking up the broken object in his hands, his gaze filled with a desolate expression.

Shi Wenyu and Deng Guochu were close friends, both working at the same department store, and their bedrooms were also conveniently located next to each other, seeing each other day and night.

One day, when Deng Guochu got out of bed, he suddenly found a finger-sized jade goose in front of his door. Except for its wings, which were emerald green, the rest was as white as snow, delicate and lovely. Because he didn't know who had lost it, he temporarily kept it safe. Before he could leave his room, he saw Shi Wenyu rush in, anxiously and agitatedly, asking point-blank, "Old Deng, have you seen a jade goose? I dropped it."

"Haven't seen it. Hey, what's so special about a little jade goose? Just forget about it if you dropped it. Is it worth getting so worked up about?"

"If you say that, you must have seen my jade goose. Please return it to me. It's almost time for work."

"Did your sweetheart give it to you?"

"…"

"If you don't answer, you can forget about finding it."

"Old Deng, then I have to tell you: Yes. Please return it to me quickly."

"No way! You have to show me a picture of her."

"She didn't give me a picture."

"Don't lie. I'm telling you: I haven't seen any jade goose or any sparrow."

Shi Wenyu knew it was useless to say more. He took an envelope from the box under his bed, pulled out a photograph from it, and handed it to his colleague.

"Little Shi, you're quite the joker. Are these twin flowers new movie stars or your sisters?"

"Don't talk nonsense! The shorter one in the photo is my girlfriend, Yanling. The other one is her sister."

"Little Shi, you're really blessed with beauty. Hey, what's her sister's name?"

"Yanping."

"What a beautiful name. Hey… umm…"

If that photo wasn't four inches but eight inches, Shi Wenyu might have noticed that Old Deng was focusing all his attention on Yanping's face.

"Hey, Little Shi, do you know if Yanping is married?"

"Why do you ask? I'm not too sure. Judging by her age, she should be married, but I've never seen her associating with any man. She doesn't even have a boyfriend."

"Excellent!" Old Deng was a little carried away with himself. "Little Shi, introduce me to her. I'm willing to be her boyfriend."

Having spent a long time together, Shi Wenyu knew Old Deng's character, and he was indeed happy to help him succeed.

Deng Guochu remembered the date: September 6, 1934, the happiest page in his life history.

In the early autumn weather, the scenery of the park was particularly pleasant. Shi Wenyu and Deng Guochu arrived at Hongkou Park at dusk. The twin flowers had already arrived as agreed. Shi Wenyu smiled and greeted Yanling, and everyone gathered together.

"This is my colleague, Mr. Deng. This is Miss Jiang Yanping, and this is Miss Yanling." Little Shi introduced them one by one.

The two couples sat on the grass, exchanging every word from the bottom of their hearts. The evening glow on the horizon was distantly visible, and the chirping of autumn insects came and went intermittently. Deng Guochu only felt that everything before him was beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful!

After that meeting, they often arranged garden outings, mostly with the four of them together. Old Deng had invited Yanping out alone, but when she arrived, she was always accompanied by her sister. He finally waited for one time when Yanping accepted his invitation alone. Old Deng thought it was an opportunity. He led her to a relatively quiet place and sat down to talk. He confessed many words of admiration to her, but she cleverly deflected the conversation.

In another solo meeting, Old Deng thought of a plan, but temporarily changed his mind and didn't dare to carry it out.

"Yanping, please close your eyes. I'll perform a magic trick for you."

He had originally planned to steal a kiss from her while he had the chance. His ears were burning, and his heart was beating very fast. He saw that she had already closed her eyes, but he still didn't dare to move. She opened her eyes again and asked in surprise, "What kind of magic trick are you doing? Have you done it yet?"

"Not yet! Quick! Please close your eyes. It's about to happen." His flustered expression was beyond words to describe.

He was prepared to disregard everything when suddenly, an old man walked by in the distance. Luckily, his anxiety gave rise to his quick wit, and he quickly picked a flower and brought it to her nostrils.

She smelled a fragrance and opened her eyes, seeing Old Deng covered in sweat, holding a white magnolia flower in his hand, extending his arm, the flower still touching her nostrils. "Oh, this is the magic trick."

Shi Wenyu told Old Deng that he was going to get engaged to Jiang Yanling in a few days and asked him to take care of all the trivial etiquette matters. While Old Deng was happy for his friend, he also thought about himself: he had repeatedly hinted at his love to Yanping, but she had never expressed anything. He was determined to break this torment.

After the engagement banquet, the guests dispersed, and the bustling hall suddenly became silent. Several in-laws were busy calling cars for the guests to return home. Shi Wenyu was persuaded to get drunk, and Yanping sat alone in a deserted corner as if touched by something. Deng Guochu took the opportunity to walk over.

"Yanping, please close your eyes. I have a very fun magic trick to perform for you."

She indeed closed her eyes. He no longer hesitated, borrowing the strength of a few glasses of wine, he summoned his courage and kissed her cheek, kissing her cherry lips.

With two loud smacks, Old Deng's face shared a slap on both sides. Yanping, who had struck the blow, had a steely expression, but although her lips moved, she couldn't speak for a long time. A few teardrops the size of red beans fell from her eyes.

Old Deng swallowed his anger and walked away.

After that, although they met, they didn't speak to each other, nor did they greet each other. After two whole months, once, Little Shi, Old Deng, and the Jiang sisters happened to meet again in the park. Yanling and Little Shi were talking happily, holding hands, and walked away, leaving Old Deng and Yanping, speechless to each other.

After a long silence, Old Deng couldn't help but speak:

"Yanping, it was my fault that day. I drank too much. I apologize to you now."

"Perhaps the fault lies with me. But my mistake isn't today. Two years ago, I knew I had made a big mistake…" She said here, bursting into tears.

"It's my fault, Yanping. Just forget about these small things. There's no need to be like this."

"You don't know the reason for my crying… Because I was tricked by someone! Hmm… Ooh…" Triggered by old sad memories, she cried even more like a spring, crying loudly.

"Who tricked you? I'll avenge you! Don't cry. Let's discuss it."

Old Deng listened to her crying and telling her story. Every word she said was a sharp blade, and his heart was pierced with wounds and shattered. He was so angry that he couldn't speak.

"So, Old Deng, the moment I see a man, I hate him and I'm afraid. The old wounds have made me lose the courage to live. He has hurt me so much. It's simply indescribable. He also showed me kindness at first. He made a wish and vowed to love me. When I lost my virginity to him… Why doesn't God make this kind of person die early? As long as he lives in the world, my pain and an invisible shackle can never be removed. I heard that he's already living with a wealthy young lady. I often worry about that nameless lady. Will her fate sooner or later become the same as mine?"

Old Deng still couldn't speak. Before parting, he asked her for a commemorative object. Yanping generously took off a fresh, crystal-clear jade goose from her neck and handed it to him, telling him that it was an item left by her late mother. It was originally a pair, and the sisters each took one. She was preparing to leave Shanghai and go to a convent in another city to spend the rest of her life. This jade goose, seeing the object is like seeing the person, left as a memory of friendship.

Deng Guochu held the broken jade goose, recalling the past. Two years had passed, and everything was different. Yanling already had children, while Yanping's whereabouts were unknown, at the ends of the earth, where she was living?

"Uncle, why are you crying?"

Hearing the innocent child's voice, he had to stop his tears, carefully wrapped the broken goose in a handkerchief, and put it in his arms, continuously calling out softly:

"Yanping, Yanping, I wish you well! I wish you well!"

### First Offense (Selection of World Famous Paintings)

— Cheng Lu

By Lady Stanley. Collection of the Tate Gallery, London.

Lady Stanley was an artist herself, and her husband was a great explorer.

Her artistic life started early, because she was already learning to paint before she started learning to read and write. She received excellent training. She first studied with Bowtell and Sir Leighton, and later in Paris with Henner, where she spent three winters.

Her works on street beggars, ocean goddesses, and mountain nymphs are a major feature of London art exhibitions. At the same time, her black and white drawings are also very popular in the magazine world.

"First Offense" is a deeply portrayed work. It was exhibited at the New Gallery in 1896 and purchased by Sir Tate, who also asked Lady Stanley to paint more drafts of ragged children.

### Setting Sun

— Mi Lixing

Dedicated to Mozart's "Poem":

Divertismento 17eme en Re Mineur

(Divertismento No. 17 in D Minor)

For a century and a half, among the famous works that Franz Schubert left to us later generations, besides the most approachable Ave Maria (Hail Mary) and the Symphonie Lnachevee (Symphony No. 8 "B Minor" Unfinished Symphony), which he himself thought he "no longer had the creative power to continue writing", how many later generations of "music lovers" would understand the two "C" major masterpieces that he carefully structured, which were a thousand times better than these two works, yet were not noticed or admired by the general public? However, in the process of a century and a half, our Schubert has undoubtedly become, from the remaining sounds of these two "C" major masterpieces, since Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, the only great thinker and creative composer who combines H, M, and B.

In the last three cold summers of his life, which was full of hardship and poverty, he repeatedly savored this chapter of Mozart's "Poem" (Divertismento Poetique) due to his infatuation, and the "inspiration" he gained finally led to the completion of these two "C" major masterpieces in the early autumn of 1824: (A) Quintteto III eme en do Majeur (Quintteto No. 3 in C Major) (B) Sympi.onie 5 eme, en do Majeur (Symphony No. 5 in C Major). The former describes his own admiration for Mozart, while the latter reveals a hint of suspicion that the "Poem" of Mozart did not come from his own hand but from the divine power of God. The total revelation of the two "C"s; our bold Schubert seems to be questioning God straightforwardly: "God! Why did you create Mozart and burden me, a younger generation, to exhaust my efforts and even my entire life!"

However, this has added two "C" major masterpieces to the brilliant history of human art. Is it a gift from heaven? Or the "Poem" of Mozart?

Divertismento No. 17 in D Minor, i.e. Divertismento Poetique, was written by Mozart in 1787 in Rientz, a small village near Vienna. The whole piece is divided into four sections:

Ier Mouvement Allegro

IIeme Mouvement Adagio

IIIeme Mouvement Minueto

VIIeme Mouvement Presto

The main theme is completely written to commemorate his deceased teacher Joseph Haydn. From beginning to end, every note fully expresses his childlike thoughts, and every moment shows his reverie of remembering the dead or the possibility of the soul returning. But only after the third section does he begin to realize the inherent comfort of the afterlife, that the body may die, but the spirit does not perish. Finally, in the last section, he annotates the following "philosophical words," adding to the sigh of life's uncertainty, and actively uses "Presto" to pour out everything that others in the past and future have failed to write in one breath. This is today's "Setting Sun Poem."

"In the same sunset as today, his kind face, with that patient color, the past events of music, all seem to be right before my eyes, but today, revisiting the old place, the woods are still the same, but that predecessor, who can only be imagined, sleeps forever in the ground, the green moss never ends, the brevity of life, standing in the setting sun, wanting to speak but having no words, no words, no words, no words in today's setting sun."

April 1787, Mozart in Rientz

### Recommending "Spring Chill"

— Shaofu

The performance of spoken drama has never been interrupted since the victory. There is at least one troupe performing every day, sometimes even two or three. Everyone has seen the efforts of drama workers, but the box office record is far from comparable to the victory. Therefore, many troupes are either losing money or dare not try lightly.

A closer analysis of this sluggish phenomenon is probably caused by the large influx of foreign films and the tastes of Shanghainese. It is not a matter of ticket prices being high or low, nor is it entirely due to the general public's preference for low-level tastes. If this analysis is correct, the future of Shanghai's theatrical movement is worth worrying about.

It is said that after the victory, only two plays made money, one was "Promotion Chart" and the other was "A Teacher for All Ages." All other performances lost money, only in varying amounts. The quality of a play cannot be measured by the number of seats sold, especially in China. Even many foreign films are no exception. A troupe is different from a store. At least at present, most troupes still value artistry over business, so making money is not necessarily the goal of a troupe. However, precisely because a troupe is not a profit-making organization, its normal and reasonable expenses must be resolved, otherwise, it will not be able to continue working. If it loses money again, it will be even more unthinkable.

Under these circumstances, many troupes have embarked on the road of business, which is not surprising: this is naturally not a reasonable approach. Friends in the drama circle should actively discuss and seek a proper path, because as time goes by, we can easily imagine its future appearance.

Starting yesterday, "Spring Chill," written by Song Zhi and directed by Hong Shen, was staged at the Lyceum Theatre. As one of the audience members, I am willing to recommend this performance to my readers. I dare to guarantee that this is one of the few good performances in Shanghai after the victory. If you truly appreciate drama, you should not miss this performance. The playwright's humor, the director's rigor, and the actors' cultivation can all be said to be first-class.

Drama workers should know to struggle for survival, struggle to continue their work, but they need our audience's cooperation even more, to give them courage and give them encouragement. If we all go to see it, we can achieve the above goals. After watching it, what the criticism is like is another matter.

The most heartbreaking thing in the world is being ignored and neglected. Can we treat this group of hard-working and arduous drama workers with high ideals and enthusiasm in such a cruel way?

Therefore, here, I am more willing to recommend "Spring Chill."

### The Story of the Briefcase

— Rumormonger

I hope this is just a preposterous and unsubstantiated tale! Yesterday, I heard the following news from a friend:

In the 1950s, in the capital city of Country C in Continent A, there was a Major General Counselor in a certain government office. Every morning, he would go to the office from his residence carrying a deflated, large leather briefcase. Every evening, he would go home from the office carrying a plump, large leather briefcase. Naturally, the briefcase was still the same one, but it had become plump.

One day, two days, three days... several days passed, and it seemed that there was no exception. The military police comrade on duty at the gate saw it every day. At first, they thought it was unfinished official business being taken home, but as the days went by, they always saw the deflated briefcase being carried in and the plump briefcase being carried out. They only saw things being taken out and never saw anything being taken back. They couldn't help but feel suspicious. For the sake of their duty, they finally launched an attack one evening after work.

As usual, the Counselor was carrying the plump briefcase out.

"Attention! Salute!" The military police comrades didn't dare to neglect the formalities.

The Counselor expertly raised his right hand, returned the salute, and just as his foot was about to step on the first step at the entrance, one of the two gate military police officers respectfully called out:

"Reporting, Counselor! We are ordered to inspect the Counselor's briefcase!"

This was unacceptable. How could a Major General Counselor's official briefcase be easily inspected by others? In order to maintain due dignity, he refused their request on the grounds of "classified information." However, the military police comrade refused to easily let it go and further reported the reason for "being ordered to inspect," leaving him with no way to refuse. What to do? Decades of struggle, the family's tradition of integrity passed down through generations, and his lifelong reputation of integrity and self-restraint... all would be ruined this time... His heart turned into a termite nest, with hundreds of termites wriggling inside, but he still maintained his composure and dignity on the surface. A flash of inspiration finally gave him a solution.

"Inspection is allowed, but it must be opened in front of the Director. Otherwise, no."

So, one military police officer followed our Counselor to the Director's office. Fortunately, the Director had not yet left, and there was hope for resolving their dispute.

After entering the Director's office, the Counselor performed the customary greetings and salutations. Before the military police officer could report, the Counselor preemptively spoke:

"Reporting, Director! He wants to inspect my briefcase because my family is large and ten thousand yuan a month is not enough to cover expenses, so every day I bring home the leftover rice from the government's meals..."

Speaking of this, his eyes suddenly turned sour, and tears welled up. His throat seemed to be choked with a wad of cotton, and he began to sob, unable to continue. He forgot his position as a Major General Counselor and instead sobbed like a child who had been bullied and returned to his mother's embrace to complain. The Director couldn't figure out what was going on and thought he had developed a nervous disorder. After the military police comrade's explanation, the Director took the briefcase from his hand, opened it, and saw that the white paper package was filled with white and soft cold rice grains. The clever Director immediately understood everything, waved his hand, and told the military police officer to leave...

The next day, our Counselor received a notice from the accounting office, which essentially stated that, upon the Director's order, because Counselor × was diligent in his work and of high moral character, a special subsidy of 50,000 legal tender would be issued each month, and he should come to the office to collect this month's subsidy.

The story ends here with a happy ending. Recently, it was heard that the C Country authorities, in view of the fact that the treatment of the national comrades was too meager, had doubled the salaries of all ranks from July of this year. A general's monthly income is 250,000 yuan, which is comparable to the 50-yuan base salary of workers in Shanghai, so he has nothing to be ashamed of. As for the recent situation of that Counselor, I haven't heard anything. I wish his family a life of plenty!

### Five-Minute Romance

— Cheng Lian

Dusk, I walk on the side of Jing'an Temple Road.

A U.S.N. sailor wanders not far ahead.

A rich fragrance blows in the breeze. A girl in strange clothes, twisting her waist and taking quick steps, catches up from behind. She walks so uncomfortably, obviously because her high heels are too high.

"Hello," she approaches him and greets him softly.

He glances at her and continues walking.

"Where are you going?" She leans closer to him.

He still looks at her and gives her a smile.

She returns him a flirtatious wink.

She opens her glass purse, takes out two cigarettes, and hands one to him.

He takes out a lighter from his pocket.

"Thank you," he takes her cigarette.

"Thank you," he lights her cigarette.

They smoke cigarettes. Her hand is linked with his, and his hand is also linked with hers.

Their words are even lower, whispering softly.

She points to the billboard of the movie theater beside the road, saying something to him, and he nods.

Layers of night cover them, and neon lights flash dazzlingly.

She leans even closer to him, disappearing into the endless darkness.

Only five minutes! Their love has already matured, or perhaps it will have a deeper relationship!

### Dialogue

— Kun Ming

Passenger: It's so hot today, it's really unbearable.

Rickshaw puller: It should be hot.

Passenger: What kind of talk is that?

Rickshaw puller: It rained so much in the past two months that the rice in the fields was ruined. If it wasn't hot, wouldn't it be even worse?

Passenger: But it's still uncomfortable when it's hot.

Rickshaw puller: The farmers are happy! Because the fields can slowly recover.

Passenger: What does that have to do with me?

Rickshaw puller: Oh! Sir, you have to eat!

Passenger: Eat? Hmph! I have money, am I afraid I can't buy rice?

Rickshaw puller: But money can't be eaten.

Passenger: Stop talking nonsense, pull faster, pull faster, I have things to do.

Rickshaw puller: Alas! It's scorching above and burning below, sir, you really don't know how hard it is for us rickshaw pullers!

Passenger: Then who told you to pull a rickshaw?

Rickshaw puller: Hey! Who told you to ride in a rickshaw? If there were no passengers, we wouldn't pull rickshaws.

Passenger: Damn it, I ran into a talkative guy like you. Now the authorities want to eliminate rickshaws. In three years, let's see what you'll do!

Rickshaw puller: Three years later, sir, will you be able to ride in a car in three years?

### Within School Circles

If a group of girls are standing on the escalator chatting, then when a boy walks up, he will definitely politely step aside. Conversely, if a group of boys are standing in one place, the same thing happens when a girl walks past. This can be said to be a commonly recognized theorem among students.

If a high school has both general and business departments, then generally speaking, the two are bound to be in opposition. Often, if the business department organizes something, the general department will never participate. Furthermore, if the business department organizes some kind of club, the general department will try to sabotage it. Everywhere, the non-cooperation between the general and business departments can be seen. Currently, this is the case in almost all schools in Shanghai that have business departments. It is extremely rare for the general and business departments to truly be able to cooperate harmoniously.

### Last Year Today

— Zuo Qi

Last year today, in Shanghai, around six in the morning, I received a call from a friend who said:

"Tokyo Radio broadcast last night that Japan has surrendered unconditionally to the United Nations."

"Oh, really?" I asked with a tone of surprise, excitement, and half-doubt.

Then I received more than a dozen calls. Relatives and friends all told me about this matter. Some only said, "Do you know what happened last night?" I quickly replied, "I know, I know." Everyone understood each other tacitly, afraid of being "listened to" by the Japanese secret police stationed in the telephone bureau.

Citizens couldn't hide their excitement, forgetting that this might be a rumor. The entire city resounded with firecrackers all day, and there were two peculiar new activities: ball games—a portion of citizens surrounded Japanese residents, snatched their hats, and tossed them back and forth like basketballs; target practice—throwing watermelon rinds at passing Japanese military trucks.

In the evening, the "air defense posture" under the enemy puppet regime was dissolved invisibly. Citizens replaced their light bulbs with high-wattage ones, and the air raid shelter lamps were thrown aside. Shanghai once again became a city that never sleeps.

A majestic song resounded again on the radio, "Arise, you who refuse to be slaves!"

### Smoking

— Lin Yin

Father: Little devil!

Son: What? Are you swearing at me!

Father: Why are you smoking?

Son: I'm patriotic!

Father: Smoking is patriotic? Who told you that?

Son: Didn't the newspaper say that foreign cigarettes are being dumped, and no one is smoking domestic cigarettes? If no one smokes domestic cigarettes, factories will close down, and won't China's future be greatly affected by industrial bankruptcy? So I'm trying hard to learn to smoke. Look! Isn't this pack of cigarettes domestic?

Father: Hmm!
