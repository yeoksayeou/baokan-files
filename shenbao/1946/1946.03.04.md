[Reuters, Chongqing, 3rd] The Second Plenary Session currently being held in Chongqing is the first meeting since the Japanese surrender. President Chiang is personally presiding. It is widely expected that the plenary session will make important decisions regarding the future status of China's ruling party in the constitutional period.

[United Press, Chongqing, 3rd] Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, Wu Tiecheng, reported to the Second Plenary Session yesterday that over 5,000 Kuomintang underground workers were killed by the Japanese during the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan. Regarding domestic political events, Wu stated that the resolutions obtained at the Political Consultative Conference proved the Kuomintang's sincerity in hoping for democracy. He also stated that the people of the Northeast have "not yet been protected by the government, and their rights to survival and democracy have become a problem." China's recognition of Outer Mongolia's independence indicates the Kuomintang's sincerity in implementing Sun Yat-sen's nationalism, but efforts will be made to strengthen the national consciousness of various border ethnic groups to consolidate national unity. He further emphasized that all actions that violate diplomatic, financial, and military principles should be thoroughly corrected.

### An American Female Journalist Talks About Her Impressions of Visiting Yan'an; Arriving in Shanghai Today en Route to the United States to Lecture

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 3rd] American female journalist Atlee, who recently returned from an inspection tour of Yan'an, will go to Shanghai on the morning of the 4th and then travel to the United States to engage in lecturing and writing. When the reporter interviewed her, she said that her impression of Yan'an was: she met with General Zhu De in Yan'an. The CCP is still in the early stages of implementing communism. Before the working class and peasants fully believe in communism, they must still go through a stage like the Soviet Union's so-called New Economic Policy. The CCP is making every effort to win over the people. If the CCP gains power, I believe they may take the same path as the Soviet Union, because they seem to follow Moscow on certain issues, and they also lack political sincerity. For example, when talking about the Northeast issue, their concern for Soviet interests seems to exceed their concern for Chinese interests, and they often cleverly defend the Soviet Union. Their methods and arguments are the same as those of communists elsewhere. Although their work is very diligent, the most pessimistic thing is that they often ignore the magnitude of the international losses inflicted on China.

### Soviet Army Withdrawal Plan from the Nine Eastern Provinces: Moscow Yet to Respond. Peng Bisheng Denies Claims of National Army Withdrawal from Shenyang.

[United Press Chongqing, 3rd] According to reliable sources here today, China's policy toward the nine eastern provinces is to refuse any economic concessions beyond the Sino-Soviet Treaty. The general public believes that China's policy has hardened due to two factors: (1) national sentiment as expressed by student demonstrations, and (2) the clear attitude of the United States toward international events as clarified in Secretary of State Byrnes' speech. Regarding reports that the Soviet Union has protested the anti-Soviet demonstrations by Chinese students, Chinese officials have neither confirmed nor denied it. However, according to inquiries made by reporters with reliable sources, the Soviet side has indeed lodged this protest, but the exact wording is being kept strictly secret by the authorities. China sent a note to Moscow on January 29, inquiring about the Soviet Union's plan to withdraw its troops from the nine eastern provinces. It is reported that China is still awaiting a reply from the Soviet Union. The Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee will discuss the situation in the nine eastern provinces tomorrow.

American Telegraph Newspaper Argues that the Soviet Union Underestimates Sino-American Friendship

[Central News Agency New York, 2nd] The U.S. State Department's statement opposing the Soviet Union's removal of industrial equipment from Northeast China and the U.S. Navy's protest against the Soviet Union's shooting down of a U.S. aircraft flying over Dalian were both prominently featured on the front pages of American newspapers today, with headlines such as "America Condemns Soviet Attack on U.S. Aircraft and Removal of War Booty" and "U.S.-Soviet Relations Increasingly Tense." It is generally believed that these two protests are an indication of the increasingly tough attitude of the United States toward the Soviet Union after Byrnes' speech at the Overseas Correspondents Club. The news broke suddenly, and newspapers did not have time to write editorials. Only the Scripps-Howard-owned World Telegram criticized the United States' opposition to the Soviet Union's removal of industrial equipment from the Northeast. The newspaper published an editorial titled "Soviet Thief," stating that Stalin "is foolish to use his strong military power in the Northeast," because "he underestimates not only Chinese friendship, but also American friendship, and he needs the friendship of both countries." "Mr. Stalin should know that a free China will rely on the industry of the Northeast, and he should know that the United States would rather fight Japan than sacrifice China."

[United Press Moscow, 3rd] Moscow Radio broadcast last night that General Stankevich denied that the removal of machinery from Shenyang factories was based on the Anglo-American-Soviet Three-Power Agreement, saying that the United Press report was completely fabricated. According to reports, after United Press reporter Davies and eight other American and British reporters arrived in Shenyang, they telegraphed on the 21st of last month, stating that a reporter asked Stankevich what happened to the heavy industrial machinery built by the Japanese, what were the war spoils? Stankevich replied: "In terms of the matter, we cannot allow it to remain here in accordance with the Three-Power Agreement, and a portion has already been transported out." A reporter asked again whether machinery from Shenyang had been moved to the Soviet Union? Stankevich replied: "Perhaps there is."

### Soviet Troops Continue to be Stationed in Iran. Britain and the United States are Consulting on Countermeasures. Iranian Parliamentarians Claim They Will Protest to the Three Nations.

[This Newspaper News] London, 3rd Broadcast: Iranian Parliamentarian Madajin made a shocking speech in Parliament, stating: "The Soviet Union has indicated that it will not withdraw its troops stationed in Iran, which has shocked the world. However, Iran will protest to the signatory countries of the Three-Power Agreement and also inform the Security Council. Sadana has no right to go to Moscow to discuss the issue of troop withdrawal, as the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Iran is an issue that has already been resolved. The Soviet side had long agreed to withdraw troops stationed in Iran, but now only agrees to withdraw from Michit and Salude. According to today's news, Soviet troops are still stationed there. I believe that Soviet troops will remain in our country permanently!" Mashada was not very popular in the past, but today's speech was met with continuous applause.

[Associated Press Washington, 2nd] A State Department spokesperson said today that the United States does not intend to take action on the situation in Iran unless Iran or the Soviet Union publicly request it.

[Central News Agency Washington, 3rd Reuter] The U.S. State Department yesterday confirmed that the British and American governments are consulting on the crisis caused by the continued presence of Soviet troops in the "turbulent" areas of Iran.

[Reuters Washington, 3rd] Responsible diplomatic officials here stated that the United States strongly opposes the Soviet Union's decision to station troops in Iran. It is generally expected that Britain will raise the Iranian issue at the United Nations Security Council meeting to be held in New York on March 21, and the United States will provide assistance. However, some say that the British and American governments' public expression of their views on Soviet actions will not be delayed for so long.

[Associated Press London, 2nd] British Foreign Secretary Bevin cut short his vacation, returned to London today, and immediately discussed with his advisors the protests that Britain might lodge against the Soviet Union's continued presence of Red Army troops in Iran.

Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has stated that Soviet troops want to remain in Iran based on the Soviet-Iranian treaty signed on February 28, 1931.

[United Press London, 2nd] A Foreign Office spokesperson declared today that Britain will instruct its ambassadors to the Soviet Union and Iran to provide detailed reports on the Soviet Union's failure to comply with the Anglo-American-Soviet treaty to withdraw troops from Iranian territory.

### Arab Nations Oppose Jewish Statehood; Partition of Palestine is a Source of Chaos; League Nations Issued a Joint Declaration Yesterday

[Reuters Cairo, 3rd] The Anglo-American Palestine Investigation Committee held a meeting here at the Mena House Hotel yesterday (where Chairman Chiang met with the late U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill in 1943), attended by representatives of all Arab countries. Arab League Secretary-General Assam spoke in English, stating that the Arab countries have formed a unified front on the Palestine issue and will not hesitate to fight for it if necessary. The Arab countries are in complete agreement on the Palestine issue. We have fought for Palestine for 200 years in the past, and we are prepared to continue to fight to prevent the intrusion of Jews. Palestine must continue to be an Arab country. The purpose of the establishment of the Arab League is not to compete with other powers, but to connect kindred countries and cooperate in pursuit of peace. We are willing to sacrifice for peace, order, and justice, but we can never sacrifice our survival or everything in a country that has been passed down to us by our ancestors for more than 1,300 years. Although the United States and Britain are oppressing us, we will never allow our compatriots in Palestine to be reduced to a minority. Mr. Assam also submitted a formal memorandum to the Anglo-American Investigation Committee, stating: The Arab countries recognize Palestine as the first line of defense against common dangers, and the Arab League is determined to use all means to prevent the realization of Jewish statehood with the greatest effort. After Palestine falls into the hands of the Jews, it will inevitably become the center of international turmoil and religious struggles. At the end of yesterday's meeting, Abdullah, the son of the King of Jordan, read out a declaration signed by all Arab countries, stating that Palestine cannot be separated from the world, Jewish immigration must be stopped, and the work of establishing a Jewish state must also be stopped.

### Eastern Bloc

Turkey Participating is Feared to Provoke Soviet Displeasure

[Agence France-Presse Ankara, 2nd] According to official sources here, Turkey does not intend to join any "Eastern Bloc" or closely cooperate with the Arab League in the political sphere at this time unless absolutely necessary. The most important reason is the fear of causing a very unfriendly reaction from the Soviet Union, which would only make the already very tense situation more serious without gaining anything.

[United Press Ankara, 3rd] Representatives of Turkey and Iraq held a meeting here yesterday. Observers predict that the results of the meeting could consolidate the relations between the two countries and affect the entire Middle East situation.

### Hitler Commits Suicide, New Wife Takes Poison; Britain is Searching for Witnessing Guards

[United Press Herford, 3rd] British detectives are now searching throughout Germany for a Stormtrooper guard who witnessed Hitler and his new wife Eva Braun commit suicide. This new clue was obtained by interrogating German Deputy Adjutant Colonel Von Biller. Von Biller fled Hitler's living room on April 29 of last year. It is said that on May 6, he met a soldier who told him that Hitler and Eva Braun had committed suicide on the afternoon of April 30. Hitler killed himself with a pistol, and Eva Braun died by taking poison. Afterwards, their bodies were cremated by their guards. This soldier opened the cellar on the day after Hitler's death. British detectives have already inquired about his surname, age, and appearance. Von Biller believes that Hitler had indeed committed suicide for the following reasons: (1) Hitler himself wanted to commit suicide and first expressed this intention on April 22. (2) Hitler could not escape from Berlin at this time or hide without being recognized. (3) Hitler lacked the physical strength and courage to survive. Von Biller confirmed that Hitler and Eva Braun were married in the cellar between midnight and 4:30 AM on April 29.

### Prime Minister of East India Reinstated; Expansion and Reorganization of Current Cabinet

Will Go to Batavia to Reopen Negotiations with the Dutch

[This Newspaper News] London, 3rd Broadcast: The political crisis in Indonesia caused by Prime Minister Sharif's resignation has now passed, as Prime Minister Sharif has agreed to be reinstated. Mr. Sharif obtained a vote of confidence from the Central Committee of the Indonesian National Movement today, and he has begun to reorganize and expand his cabinet. He is scheduled to lead the new cabinet back to Batavia tomorrow.

[Reuters London, 3rd] It is hoped here that after Sharif reorganizes the government, negotiations with the Dutch authorities will continue. However, if radicals gain power after the reorganization of the government, the prospects for an early resumption of direct negotiations will be thwarted, as the radicals demand unconditional recognition of independence as a prerequisite for their meeting with Van Mook. British Envoy Lord Killearn believes that the Dutch government's proposal can be a fair basis for mutually satisfactory negotiations, and the Indonesian nationalist movement should seek a solution as soon as possible for its own benefit.

### Can a US-Soviet War Be Avoided? Harriman Answers in the Negative

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, March 3rd Broadcast: Radio commentator Fanno asked former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Harriman, today whether a US-Soviet war is unavoidable. Harriman replied: "I absolutely do not believe the US and the Soviet Union will go to war, but it still depends on the Americans themselves. If Americans continue to maintain their original strength in spirit and material terms, there will be no war between the US and the Soviet Union." Harriman continued, "Although the US and the Soviet Union differ greatly in ideology, if both countries adopt a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, then this ideological difference will not be an obstacle. The Soviet Union seeks security, but using the control of neighboring countries as a way to obtain security is inappropriate. The whole world hopes to obtain collective security through the United Nations organization."

### Massive Snowfall in Western Europe, Unseen in Seventy-Four Years

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, February 2nd] Paris and its surrounding areas were covered with heavy snow yesterday, a rare occurrence in the past seventy-four years. The snow accumulation is very thick everywhere, and traffic is greatly hindered. Cars have added chains to their tires to facilitate driving, a situation that has never happened before. Another report says that the English Channel and southern England have had continuous heavy snow for days, with a snow accumulation of three feet, and all traffic in the Channel has been suspended.

### Byrnes's Firm Policy, Supported by American Officials and the Public, Connally Says Action Should Follow Negotiation, Atomic Secrets Should Not Be Disclosed Until Security is Guaranteed

[United Press, Washington, February 2nd] Since Byrnes announced a firm policy towards the Soviet Union, American officials have echoed the sentiment. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally also expressed his support at a press conference today. Connally said: "I believe that to get along with the Soviet Union, the way is not to tell them 'We are your enemies.' We should take a position that we know is upright and stick to it. When a problem arises, we should deal with it and follow negotiation with action. The government's foreign policy is firm and consistent, and I am in agreement with Byrnes's views." Connally, who had just returned from attending the United Nations meeting in London, reportedly said that Stettinius did not try to evade or shirk responsibility in the Security Council regarding the "subtle and complex four issues," namely Greece, Iran, East India, and Syria and Lebanon, and made sure that the meeting was not dominated by the Soviet Union. As a result, except for the last issue, the Soviet Union's proposals were rejected. Regarding the establishment of an atomic energy commission in the United Nations organization, Connally said: "I and others who share the same opinion believe that world security must be guaranteed by some kind of international organization before we agree to disclose atomic bomb secrets to other countries. Otherwise, no matter who, when, or under what circumstances, we will never give up the atomic bomb. When will security be guaranteed? I don't know." Connally also said that the work of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will be extended for another year.

[Central News Agency, New York, February 2nd] Mrs. McCormick, a diplomatic analyst for the New York Times, said: Byrnes's speech at the Overseas Press Club is quite in line with the general public's demand to strengthen its attitude towards the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union now makes people think that it wants to cause chaos in the world, not peace, at a time when its exhausted allies are extremely eager for a moment of peace and tranquility. As early as last winter, it was discovered that the British people, who greatly admired the Soviet Union during the war, had already felt disgusted with it, and so did the Americans. The people who previously demanded that soldiers return home now demand that the United States have a firm position. They have become aware of new difficulties and dangers and have asked the US government to shout to maintain its strength.

This matter has a very serious relationship with the overseas Chinese here, who have suffered the most severe and cruel punishments of the Japanese military and have bravely and loyally supported the United Kingdom.

After investigation, it was found to be related to the He Jinji robbery case in Zhanghuanggang, Nantong. Recently, the thief gathered a crowd, holding long and short guns, and robbed fifty-one pigs near Langshan, escorted them to Fushan and transferred them to the city. They were sold to the Beiwai Gong Sheng Pig Bank, priced at more than 3.2 million yuan. The bank did not have enough cash at the time, so they agreed to pay the next day.

Wuxi

Telegraph to Request Additional Consultation Representatives

The chairman of the Southern Jiangsu District, Southeastern District, and Chongqing Branch of the National Industrial Association of China said that in this political consultation meeting, the existing National Assembly representatives failed to allow the people who have contributed to the Anti-Japanese War in the past eight years to participate in this round of representative meetings, and the number of additional representatives was more than 700. Yesterday, he sent a special telegram to the head office, requesting that it be forwarded to the competent authorities of various parties, asking them to give priority to industrial production personnel who have contributed to the Anti-Japanese War when selecting additional representatives, so as to conform to their promises and to realize full democracy. Determine the number of places to be produced by the industrial sector, and then limit the number of places for party affiliation and factions, and entrust industrial groups across the country to elect them through universal suffrage, instead of just calling for an increase in the number of places and increasing the number of places through distribution.

Jiangyin

County Expenses in Deficit, Province Approves Allocation of Funds

The county's local expenses in this county rely entirely on taxes. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the field tax for the 34th year was exempted, and the county's political expenses were not settled. Although the province ordered the local government to raise funds by allocating loans to wealthy gentry based on the number of fields, with the 34th-year county-level public grain as collateral, the people could not bear the burden, causing disputes. Last month, the county government submitted a request to the province to borrow 20 million yuan from the Jiangsu Agricultural Bank at an interest rate, but it was not approved. Public officials at all levels are serving the public with empty stomachs. County magistrate Fang submitted a request to the province for relief. The province believes that this kind of difficulty is indeed a fact and will temporarily allocate more than 9.8 million yuan under the national tax item for this county in January to maintain it. All local fundraising measures will be abolished and no more loans will be borrowed from the people.

### A News Item Killed a Daily Newspaper: No Firecrackers in Changchun

— Written by Fang Ren

…Northeast Aviation News of this Newspaper

Let’s start with the Lunar New Year after the first victory. Really, it wasn’t the way it was imagined more than five months ago when it was first restored. There were no firecrackers on New Year’s Eve, it passed quietly. Everyone felt that "the year was not flavorful enough." However, compared with the past fourteen years, this year is still somewhat different. For example, in previous years, each person could only get the little bit of things "rationed" to them to eat - four ounces of pork, one catty of flour, half a catty of wine, two apples, and one orange. The flour and pork could only be made into dumplings and eaten all at once. This was how the most interesting Lunar New Year was spent. But this year, it can be freely bought and sold. As long as you have money, you can have as much as you want.

Comforting the Brothers, the Cold Wind Blows Away the Joy of Drinking

The Changchun City Comfort Committee, in the Lunar New Year,

For the sake of expressing condolences to the troops coming to Changchun, it specially donated 9,600 catties of pork and 3,200 catties of white wine, allowing the brothers who came to the icy and snowy areas outside the customs to have a big feast. Of course, when they were eating and drinking happily, they may have a feeling of "drinking a toast to the Yellow Dragon", but this is just a thought, which can easily be blown away by the cold wind.

The Lunar New Year mood in Changchun, the New Year's goods stalls are of course the most prominent symbol, and the only means of transportation for the common people in Changchun - the horse-drawn carriage - is the messenger spreading the New Year's atmosphere outside the New Year's goods stalls. Because the sphere of influence of the New Year's goods stalls is limited, and the horse-drawn carriages, each with a red square "Fu" character pasted on the body, and the couplet "The carriage travels thousands of miles, people and horses are safe" attached on both sides, are dazzling and gallop through the city, bringing the heat of Sima Road to every corner of the city.

Dahua Daily Suffered a Fatal Wound

There are currently three newspapers in Changchun, all of which are four-page broadsheets. One is called Changchun Daily, one is called Guangming Daily, and one is called Dahua Daily. But the general phenomenon is that news is scarce, and there is currently no way to improve it, so people who come to Changchun say in unison: When you get here, everyone has to become disabled, either deaf or blind.

Among the three newspapers, Dahua Daily has been suspended since January 31st, because the newspaper published a news item on January 29th, saying that the Soviet army issued an emergency order that firecrackers are not allowed to be set off from now on. If someone sets them off and is discovered by the Soviet army, they will be shot immediately. If they are discovered by the Chinese police, they will be detained, and the Baojia chief will also be held jointly responsible. This news item was the newspaper's fatal wound.

Since last December, the drama has been running in good luck, with six or seven troupes competing to perform, but most of them are bringing stories that have appeared on the screen in the past back to the stage. And in the Lunar New Year, the former "Manchuria Film Association", now the Northeast Film Company, performed "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom", which is said to be very popular.

Impersonating Compatriots, Japanese People Take Advantage of the Chaos

Changchun Taiwanese compatriots are often mistaken for Japanese people, and Japanese people sometimes do things that take advantage of the chaos when order has not yet been restored. When they are discovered, they often claim to be Taiwanese. In order to prevent imitation, the Taiwan Compatriot Association specially issued "Taiwan Provincial Resident Certificates" to Taiwanese compatriots to distinguish them and avoid impersonation.

From February 1st, Japanese men and women also wore a piece of white cloth symbol on their chests. The symbol was printed with a bright red diamond shape at the top. If you don’t look carefully, it looks like their sun emblem. Below the red diamond shape, there are two columns for name and address. Those who wear them on their chests have filled in the words, all in Chinese, without any foreign style. There are Japanese people walking on the streets, and there are shop assistants in the shops - there are also Japanese people.

Talk About Tigers with Fear, Black Death Has Been Discovered

There are quite a lot of petty thieves in Changchun, and there are also many young people who want iron bars on the streets. It is said that they were all "laborers" during the puppet Manchurian period and are still unable to return home and are stranded here, only begging for food. Although the Changchun Municipal Government is seeking relief, it is a drop in the bucket and has limited effect. In the past, people often said that there were no beggars in the Northeast, unless they were reclaimers who had just come here from inside the customs, who could not move in the cold winter, and there would be grain households to help them, and they would never be stranded on the streets, but now it is no longer the past.

The slogan "Eradicate the Black Death" has been discovered on the streets. Although the area where the black death patients are located is still a distance from Changchun, the people of Changchun are all afraid. When people talk about the black death, they seem to be talking about an escaped tiger, and they can't help but change their colors. (Sent on the 2nd)

### American Reporter's Objective Report: Soviet Troops in Dalian

— Written by Richard Cushing

Soviet troops are everywhere in Dalian. The Soviet Union is currently viewing Dalian as its private property. From all aspects, the Soviet army seems to be intending to stay for a long time. Soviet troops fully armed in northern Dalian are conducting large-scale exercises. Residents of Dalian firmly believe that the Soviet Union may withdraw from other parts of the Northeast after obtaining certain economic benefits, but in Dalian alone, no matter what price is given, it may not be willing to recognize it. Dalian is 30 miles away from the Soviet naval base in Lushun, and the Soviet Union has placed a strong force here, obviously wanting to strongly control it. Soviet secret police monitor the actions of foreigners, "like the Gestapo in Germany."

Countless Machines Shipped to Vladivostok via Dalian

The Soviet Union has dismantled countless machines from various factories in the Northeast and transported them to Vladivostok via Dalian. According to a resident, 80% of the equipment of the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant was loaded on 30 transport ships by the Soviet Union on December 12th last year and sailed to Vladivostok. Yesterday, the reporter arrived in Dalian by Soviet train with Star-Spangled Banner reporter Bayloros and United Press photographer Wilson. Along the way, we saw the Soviet army holding military exercises, using tanks, mortars, anti-aircraft machine guns, and tanks borrowed from the United States. As the train we were riding on approached Dalian, we caught a glimpse of Soviet soldiers fully armed, lying prone on both sides of the field, as if facing a great enemy. Artillery pieces were placed in key areas, and their types were quite alarming. Fighter-bombers are concentrated at the airport three miles outside Dalling City. The airport is currently being expanded by the Japanese to make it the largest airport in Asia. The Soviet side has a different interpretation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty signed in August last year, saying that only the Soviet Union has the right to lease Dalian during the war, and that the war cannot be considered over until peace is restored. However, according to the Chinese interpretation, Dalian is a free port, and ships from all countries can enter and exit. There is no intention in the treaty that the Soviet Union can occupy it alone. According to the treaty: Dalian is jointly defended by China and the Soviet Union.

The Mayor of Dalian Was Appointed by the Soviet Side Without Authorization

There are so many Soviet troops in Dalian that the Chinese report that nearly 40,000 Soviet troops have come from Vladivostok is not without reason. Every Soviet soldier carries a pistol or a small machine gun. This type of machine gun is the standard weapon in the Red Army, and many people carry it. Although the current mayor of Dalian is Chinese, he was appointed by the Soviet side. The Soviet military authorities did not allow reporters to meet with him. Shen Yi, the mayor of Dalian appointed by the Chinese government, has been waiting in Changchun for several weeks to take over. Dalian was ceded to Japan after the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. The buildings in the city still retain a Russian style. During the war, it was not damaged. The currencies circulating on the market include "Manchukuo" counterfeit banknotes, Northeast circulation coupons, and Soviet military tickets, with the stamp: "Refusal to use will be punished."

The Mystery of Japanese Prisoners: Why Send Them to Siberia?

There are 900,000 residents in Dalian, of which Japanese people account for a quarter. The Soviet army treats Japanese people who are prisoners of war more politely than Chinese people. This is the case throughout the Northeast, not just in Dalian. However, how the Japanese prisoners will be dealt with is still an incomprehensible mystery. They once dismantled the machinery of the arsenal for the Soviet army, but according to reliable sources: all of these prisoners have been sent to Siberia, and none have been sent back to their country. An engineer from the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant said that the Soviet army brought 3,000 to 4,000 Japanese prisoners in September last year to dismantle the large machinery of the plant. Another 3,000 to 4,000 former Japanese employees of the plant also assisted in dismantling nine furnaces in eleven days. Other equipment such as rotary cutting machines, chemical equipment, pumps, experimental instruments, motors, and vehicles were also removed. The remaining machinery was transported away by the Chinese Communist Party. The Soviet army even used tanks to transport the various machines to Dalian.

The Soviet army here may intend to live here for a long time and use the existing Japanese equipment for production. Only one locomotive factory was dismantled and will be transported to the Soviet Union to improve its domestic railway transportation. Family members of Red Army officers have come from as far away as Moscow and other Soviet cities and towns. Several White Russians have recently disappeared in Dalian, including one who was a Soviet army translator. No one knows the inside story. According to White Russians, the Soviet army does not treat White Russians well. They are all unwilling to work for the Soviet army because they do not know what will happen once they are no longer needed.

### The Relocation Problem of Tongji University

Tongji has been separated from its birthplace, Wusong, for a full eight years. Under the threat of enemy artillery fire during the "August 13th Incident," it was thrown out of its warm embrace and began a life of wandering, moving from Shanghai to all of China. This group of Tongji students ran towards their seemingly endless future. The sound of cannons gradually approached, and unexpected news continuously pierced their wounded hearts. The "July 7th Incident" resistance war had become a long-term war, and the dream of returning to their old home had been startled away by the terrifying sound of cannons. The sky was filled with smoke and the air with the stench of blood and gunpowder, chasing this group of unfortunate children to Ganzhou. They only stayed there for three months before having to move again to Kunming in the rear. Amidst all this hardship, President Ding managed to establish the College of Science, which was truly a cause for celebration! However, the shore of victory remained so distant. Under the suffocating pressure of the war, Tongji moved from Kunming to Sichuan, deep in the rear, and settled in several dilapidated temples in Lizhuang, south of the Yangtze River. Lizhuang is a small town nestled against the mountains and facing the river. Tongji has done its best to improve the local culture, install electric lights, assist in military service, and foster a democratic atmosphere. Furthermore, the dedication of its graduates in serving society and the enthusiastic participation in the military in the past are all facts before our eyes.

Prices continue to soar, but Tongji's teachers and students are still struggling in their difficult lives, forging solid pillars for the country. They bury their heads in their work, without uttering a single complaint, because they harbor beautiful aspirations, looking forward to the arrival of victory. The worthy expectation has finally become a reality. The firecrackers of victory have sounded, and the College of Law has also been established. Years of sorrowful dreams have been awakened. The melancholy of life has now turned into a smile of victory. Joy and excitement have surfaced on the faces of every young person. Everything has become new. They bless the victory amidst laughter and even bless the newborn Republic of China.

The war has been won, but "repatriation" is also being hoped for even more eagerly. We are wanderers who have been away from our hometown for a long time and are looking forward to returning home. We are eager to smell the fragrance of our old homeland's soil. However, along with the call for repatriation comes some distressing news. There is no suitable location for the Shanghai campus. This is because the Wusong campus was destroyed by enemy artillery fire. The news from the three deans of the Colleges of Medicine, Engineering, and Science, Jiang Hong, Gu Baodang, and Jiang Yisheng, who went to Shanghai three months ago, is that they are taking over a middle school, pending approval from the authorities; the hospital is being negotiated with; and there is no factory. Even the issue of a temporary campus is complicated enough. Although the three deans have made their best efforts, they are still facing many difficulties. Tongji is known for its science and engineering. The College of Engineering needs factories and machines, and the College of Medicine needs a teaching hospital. Now, the time for relocation is still unknown. However, a part of Jiaotong University has already moved to Shanghai, and Zhongshan University is scheduled to return to Nanjing before the end of May. What about us? Are we going to wait here?

Last month, President Xu Songming went to Chongqing to discuss the relocation, and soon after, he was sent to the Northeast to take over. Could it be to take over campuses, factories, and machines for Tongji? It is also heard that the president will not return, and the relocation expenses are being prepared and submitted. These many unresolved issues are deeply engraved in the hearts of over two thousand Tongji students. We hope that the following points can be resolved by the authorities as soon as possible. We hereby appeal to the public and the relevant authorities:

(1) There should be sufficient temporary campus space in Shanghai, and plans should be made to build a permanent campus.

(2) When will the date of Tongji's return be decided, and please allocate ships.

(3) Please have the president return to the school to discuss the relocation issue.

(4) Approve sufficient relocation expenses for the school.

(5) Allocate factories, hospitals, machines, medical equipment, etc. (Zhang Guanghui)

### Editorial: Reaffirmation of America's Firm Policy

U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes' speech on the 28th at the Overseas Press Club in Washington, D.C., clarifying the U.S. government's policy on the current international situation, is a speech that the world has long awaited. In today's world, where international relations have failed to move towards coordination, the release of this speech not only demonstrates the firm policy of the U.S. government, but is also very beneficial in clearing the haze of the international situation. The entire speech reveals the firm policy of the U.S. government in a tactful tone. Its main points are as follows: (1) The United States is prepared to use force to stop aggression when necessary; (2) Only an unforgivable mistake between the United States and the Soviet Union would be enough to cause a serious conflict; (3) No country has the right to station troops in the territory of other independent countries without approval or consent; (4) No strong country can take enemy property in liberated or formerly enemy-aligned countries as its own; (5) No country is allowed to dominate the world. Although this statement is a general discussion, it is aimed at the current international situation, which exists in Austria, Hungary, the Near East, Iran, and even Northeast China. The anti-Axis war defeated the "power politics" of Nazi fascism, but another totalitarianism has taken its place, attempting to dominate the world.

It goes without saying that Byrnes' speech is specifically aimed at the situation that has emerged in Northeast China. The Soviet army's stationing in the Northeast has not only failed to facilitate the National Army's advance, but also cultivated puppet forces within its defense zone to hinder the National Army's entry. At the same time, it has said that the National Army has failed to take over, so the Soviet army's occupation cannot but be extended. All of this seems to be contrary to the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. No matter what the situation, the fact remains that our army has failed to enter Shenyang City. The failure to start the takeover work in the Northeast remains a fact. Even U.S. Special Envoy to China General Marshall believes that the time is not ripe to go to the Northeast for an inspection, and cannot go. It can be seen that the situation in the Northeast remains unclear. At this time, the publication of the U.S. Secretary of State's speech, although it cannot be said to directly help clear the situation in the Northeast, is ultimately beneficial to the development of the overall situation by clarifying the firm stance of the United States.

Following Byrnes' speech, we also saw a statement issued by a U.S. State Department spokesman on the first day: "News reports from the Northeast stating that the Soviet Union is transporting so-called 'war booty' in the Northeast have prompted the United States to express its concern to the Soviet government. The United States began discussing this matter with the Soviet government through the U.S. Embassy in Moscow about three weeks ago, and has recently begun discussing it with the governments of other relevant countries. This discussion does not mean that it has already learned of the Soviet Union's transportation of so-called war booty, as the United States has not received direct information on this matter, nor has it officially learned of the actual situation. The State Department issued the following statement on this matter: "We have no secret agreement or other agreement with the Soviet government or any other government regarding 'war booty' in the Northeast. The U.S. government does not recognize the interpretation of 'war booty' to include industrial or organizational elements, such as Japanese industries and equipment in the Northeast. Some time ago, we notified the Soviet government that the disposal of Japanese assets abroad, such as industries in the Northeast, is a matter of common interest, and is related to all Allied countries that have borne a greater burden in defeating Japan. At this time, it is inappropriate to treat these industrial assets as 'war booty' and transport them from the Northeast, or for China and the Soviet Union to make any final disposal of Japanese foreign assets in the Northeast through an agreement on the control of these assets. The U.S. government has recently begun discussing with the relevant governments how to dispose of Japanese assets abroad as reparations."

The issuance of this statement, with its strict interpretation of the term "war booty," is very beneficial to the development of the situation in the Northeast. With the above two statements, it can be seen that the U.S. policy is becoming increasingly firm. However, to clear the current international haze, especially the haze that exists in Northeast China, merely relying on one-sided speeches or talks, while sufficient to express an attitude, may still not have much impact on the actual situation. The reason why the situation in the Northeast has evolved to the current stage is mainly due to the international background. The secret Yalta Agreement determined the fate of the Northeast; and in determining its fate, we have never participated. To clear the haze in the Northeast, it seems that this is no longer a matter that can be resolved by China and the Soviet Union alone. All countries participating in the Yalta Agreement must jointly rise up and work hard, and then there may be a way to resolve the situation. We welcome the reaffirmation of the firm policy of the United States, and we hope that the U.S. government can take practical actions to support its firm national policy in addition to issuing statements.

### Strolling in Guangzhou

— Special Correspondent Liang Feng of This Newspaper in Guangzhou

What brightens up the spring here should be a few large-scale entertainment venues that opened at the same time as the Spring Festival. One is on Changdi, one is in Central Park, and the others are on Huifu Road and in Xiguayuan. These entertainment venues are all run by the authorities, some are sponsored by the Winter Relief Association, and some are sponsored by the Emergency Relief Association.

Saving Through Entertainment: Effectiveness Remains to Be Seen

It is said that these entertainment venues are all opened for relief purposes. Although the locations are different, the meaning of relief is the same. The so-called saving through entertainment is like "dancing without forgetting to save the country," so many say that Cantonese people are clever. As long as you are willing to spend three to four hundred dollars, you can watch several plays, and the venue also adds things like air gun shooting, throwing rings around treasure ducks, and dog fighting. While it remains to be seen in a "future installment" how many refugees can actually be saved, at the very least, it has made hundreds of thousands of citizens "happy in it."

A Few Days of "Black Market Holiday" Has Made Small Civil Servants Miserable

In the agencies, after a few days of "black market holiday" for the Spring Festival, the small civil servants dragged their tired bodies to the offices to "await instructions." However, many officials are still in high spirits, perhaps because "the spring scenery is annoying." The most popular thing is the silver lamp wax board game [dancing]. Although there is an explicit ban on dancing here, there are really no open dance halls, but dance parties that are not openly held but are actually open are held every day. The more famous ones here are the Victory Building, the Association of Students Who Have Studied in the East, the Association of Students Who Have Studied in the United States, the Association of Students Who Have Studied in France, and the Hawaii Restaurant, etc. In addition, there are many private dance parties in the style of entertainment departments.

Two Major Generals Learn the Foxtrot; Female Committee Members Open Dance Parties

Every time the lights come on, the doors of these places are crowded with all kinds of cars. It can be seen that those attending are all distinguished figures. Inside the venue, there are either neat suits or dazzling military uniforms, which are matched with the colorful spring clothes of the ladies. The graceful dance shadows are really a magnificent sight. The most popular dance in Guangzhou is the tango, followed by the waltz and the blues, rumba, etc. The "rumba hawk" and "balistrudu" that are popular in Hong Kong are rarely seen at dance parties in Guangzhou, but "full-court dances" are occasionally held. According to the reporter's investigation, recently, two major generals felt that dancing was necessary in social situations, and specially hired experts to serve as instructors. Recently, they have been seen appearing on the dance floor, and they are quite able to put their arms around their waists and do the foxtrot. It is also a fact that a certain female committee member once opened a dance party to entertain distinguished guests. From this, it can also be seen how popular dancing is here!

The Commercial Offensive Has Not Yet Moved; The Theater Movement Is Flourishing Everywhere

In the commercial field, things seem very quiet. The stores are all quiet, and there is no sign that they are preparing to launch a "spring offensive."

In the cultural circle, a larger event during the spring days is the theater people's celebration of the first theater festival after the victory. On February 15th, hundreds of theater people held a celebration for the Eighth Theater Festival in the People's Auditorium. After the meeting, all the theater people held a hike to visit the Japanese prisoner of war camp and Lingnan University. There is also a grand program, which is the rotation of thirteen plays performed by theater troupes from all over the city.

### Navigation Administration Bureau Orders Allocation of Ships to Transport Salt to Aid Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi

After the victory, the need for salt in the recovered areas of Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi is extremely urgent. In the past, a considerable amount was continuously transported via the Yangtze River waterway. However, the area is vast, and the supply is still insufficient. Recently, the water level of the Yangtze River has dropped, making it inconvenient for large ships to navigate, and the amount of construction and transport has also decreased, so the demand for salt is even more urgent. It is understood that the production areas of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Huai have abundant reserves, but only lack ships for transportation. In order to solve this problem, the Ministry of Communications recently ordered the Navigation Administration Bureau in this city to order all shipping agencies to give priority to allocating ships to quickly transport the salt stored in this city to the recovered areas of Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei, and to send ships to the production areas of Zhejiang to transport. After receiving the instructions from the Navigation Administration Bureau, the shipping companies are unifying plans. It is reported that the Dahua vessel of the Ping An Shipping Bureau returned to Shanghai from Fuzhou yesterday with a large amount of salt. In addition, the Minglun vessel of the Sanbei Company is expected to arrive in port today, also carrying more than 5,000 packages of salt from Fuzhou.

### Social Services: Vocational Youths Hope to Change Professions

Difficult to Achieve Now, Must Wait for the Future

Dear Editor, your newspaper's social services have long been trusted by the public, and even ignorant people like our group of young apprentices trust you extremely. We are a group of 15-16 year old youths, primary school graduates, who are apprentices in tailor shops and cigarette stores. We entered these small industries because of economic pressure or other circumstances. Our original aspirations were to work in railways or transportation. However, things did not go as we wished. Sir, I am a young person, and like every young person, I need to work enthusiastically. How can I just wither away like this? Sir, although I have never met you, I believe you are a warm-hearted person who will not abandon us. Therefore, I am raising this question for you to answer and hope you can tell us whether there are any opportunities now to become railway workers and whether food and lodging are provided. I believe there are many people who have the same experiences and hopes as us, and this will make people who have similar experiences endlessly grateful. Respectfully wishing you good health, from vocational youths Ma Xueqi and twelve others.

Editor's Note: You are all ambitious young people. Do not be fickle and should adapt to circumstances. This is not opposing your ambition, but under the current circumstances, you cannot freely choose your profession. You must wait until economic construction has reached considerable success before you can obtain a good profession. As the saying goes, "There are 360 professions, and every profession can produce a champion." For now, we can only view it this way. As for wanting to work in railways and transportation, it is not impossible to achieve the goal when there is an opportunity. Brief reply provided, do you agree?

### Labor-Management Disputes in the Newspaper Industry: Authorities Distribute Arbitration Awards

Settlement Reached in Western Restaurant and Coffee Shop Labor Strike

The Shanghai Newspaper Industry Workers' Union previously requested a wage increase from the employers, stipulating that from February of this year, the base monthly salary for workers would be calculated based on the average wage of 55 yuan per worker in 1937. The adjustment of salaries would be based on the worker's cost of living index published by the municipal government. The employers did not agree to this request, so the arbitration committee appointed by the municipal government, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the General Labor Union discussed the matter several times and decided on the arbitration award on March 2nd, which has been delivered to both parties. The main points are as follows: The employers should increase wages starting from February of this year. The method of increasing wages is as follows: (A) The employers should individually negotiate the base wage with each worker, based on the worker's skills, service experience, past practices of each newspaper, and business conditions, within a range of 30 yuan to 50 yuan in legal tender. Then multiply by the total worker's cost of living index for the current month. (B) Subsequent monthly wages will be adjusted according to the total worker's cost of living index for each month.

Workers in the Western restaurant and coffee shop industry in this city have been on strike for some time, and after several mediation attempts by the Bureau of Social Affairs, a satisfactory resolution has been reached. The workers will resume work uniformly today. Yesterday, the employers' representative Wang Zhen, the workers' representative Zhu Shifa, and five others, along with Zhu Guilin from the Bureau of Social Affairs and Fang Rusheng from the Municipal Party Headquarters, signed the mediation record at the Jin Gu Hotel.

In addition, the Shanghai Letterpress Printing Workers' Union sent representatives to negotiate with the employers' association on the 23rd of last month. The workers requested adjustments to the four basic living benefits: (1) A minimum monthly salary of 45 yuan, calculated according to the cost of living index for the current month, and implemented from February. (2) Two meals and one bowl of porridge per day. (3) Implementation of a 128-hour work system, with night work counted as five hours per shift. (4) All Sundays and national holidays are to be off. After several rounds of negotiation, the employers did not agree, leading to a work slowdown.

### Leather Goods Workers Beaten for Urging Work Stoppage

Six with Bloody Heads

[Report from this Newspaper] Because of requests for better treatment, the Leather Goods Workers' Union in this city had previously requested mediation from the Bureau of Social Affairs, but no resolution has been reached. Therefore, the union recently sent dozens of workers to various leather suitcase and leather goods workshops to urge a work stoppage. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, several workers from the union went to the Da Kang Leather Goods Workshop at No. 84, Yong Cheng Li, East Da Ming Road. The owner, Liu Mingji, and his son, Shi De, seeing them arrive, secretly gathered more than 30 dockworkers from the Qing Gang gang, who arrived with iron rulers and other weapons and surrounded the workers and beat them, leaving six with bloody heads. The injured were then taken to the Hu Dong Hospital by the police officers on duty. After the incident was reported, the union gathered more than 200 workers and rushed to the scene. The Tilanqiao Branch Bureau also dispatched a large number of armed police and security forces to suppress the situation. The police bureau took Liu Mingji and his son into custody for investigation.

### Amidst Fluctuations in Gold: A Summary of Market Conditions for the Week

This past week, financial assets have fluctuated under governmental decrees including a decision to open the foreign exchange market, causing market participants to experience a period of uncertainty, and initiating decline in the trading volume and price of foreign currencies. This weakness spread to other goods, with slight declines noted in all sectors. As market participants see that open trade is forthcoming, hoarders began to take a cautious approach. Although there are still occasional blips and dips, such movements are much more narrow in scope, unlike the violent swings of the past. Gold prices fell from 1.72 million yuan at the beginning of the week to 1.42 million yuan on Saturday. The price of the US dollar also declined from 2,500 yuan to around 2,000 yuan.

Private trading of Chinese stocks on Monday was sluggish with minimal demand and two "hot" stocks and three smaller ones trending downward. On Thursday, liquidity shifted when Northern trading groups began to aggressively buy, causing a dramatic upward trend. Meiya rose above 2,000 yuan and textile mills rose to 2,750 yuan. A return to downtrends was observed on Saturday.

The trend of foreign stocks mirrored that of Chinese stocks, with ambiguity at the start of the week and rising strength observed beginning Thursday. Retreating strength returned on Saturday.

Government bonds exhibited weakness at the beginning of the week, with type C bonds falling as low as 1,450 yuan. Liquidity returned again on Wednesday, causing a surge in prices. On Saturday, rumors of government investigators caused prices to recede slightly.

In the past week, the spot market for cotton yarns saw a decline due to the falling price of gold. Buyers from Guangdong and Wuhan, major purchasers, reduced their activity relative to the previous week, causing participants who held physical cotton to sell as prices rose, leading to downward pressure on the market. The fabric market started out with tightness in supply but gradually weakened in line with gold and yarn prices. As for the raw cotton market, the primary source of demand was Fangjian Corporation, which aggressively purchased high-grade fine cotton such as 42 and 32-count. Transactions of Mitterlin cotton were particularly high. Beyond this, inventories held by textile mills were sufficient to satisfy their demand, leading to low demand and the prices of high-grade fine cotton remaining average, with coarse-grade seed cotton performing weaker. Overall, Mitterlin cotton rose by 4,000 yuan. Dasun, Jisan, Yu Zhen, Brazilian, Xiasha, and fire-engine cotton remained largely unchanged. Seed cotton from Zhoupu saw a decline of 3,300 yuan.

Within the past week, the value of spot rayon dropped by a massive 500,000 yuan through Thursday. There are three main reasons for this. First, warehouse receipts for Tongfa warehouses can be used to withdraw actual rayon. Second, the practice of trading in warehouse receipts has been restricted to reduce speculation. Third, the price of gold crashed, forcing the rayon market to follow the overall trend. From Friday onward, prices rebounded by over 100,000 yuan, for a total weekly decline of 350,000 yuan. Semi-gloss rayon was in high demand, trading at a 100,000 yuan premium above gloss rayon on Tuesday, and losing 200,000 yuan overall. Individual dealers in textile goods were experiencing losses between 200,000 and 250,000 yuan, and the volume of trade over the week was quite limited. Meanwhile, the occasional transaction of Dan silk was completed under accommodating terms with five-day promissory notes. Amongst silk fabrics, Meiya blanket covers and Dacheng Ge Bi crepe experienced heavy declines from Tuesday to Thursday but experienced a rebound from buyers trying to take advantage of low prices on Friday. Overall, the weekly change in Meiya blanket cover prices was a loss of 15,000 yuan per hundred, and Dacheng Ge Bi crepe lost 460 yuan.

Rice prices saw a minor recovery at the beginning of the week but experienced a rising trend overall due to limited supplies caused by days of rain. In contrast, the price of flour remained relatively stable due to the availability of CRRRA flour.

### Xu Shiying and Others Organize Anhui Tea Company, Capital of 200 Million Yuan

Anhui produces tea of excellent quality and abundant quantity, which has always been sold domestically and internationally, with exports being particularly significant. Qimen black tea and Tunxi green tea have long been famous. Before the war, the annual output was several hundred thousand boxes. Xu Shiying and others specifically united various tea merchants to organize a large-scale Anhui Tea Company. The Anhui Provincial Government also participated in the share capital. The business goal is mainly export and secondarily domestic sales. The company helps tea farmers, improves production technology, enhances quality, reduces costs, and provides production funds. With the tea season approaching this year, it plans to establish tea farms while cooperating with existing tea farms and tea houses in various producing areas, planning to produce 14,000 boxes of Qihong, 20,000 boxes of Tun green, and 2,500 dan of Qing tea. It is rumored that its capital is 200 million yuan.

### Commercial Survey: Recent Situation of Shanghai Silk Weaving Factories

Silk weaving factories, since the fall of Shanghai, have suffered various illegal destructions by the enemy, such as restricting electricity, even cutting off supply, forcing them to stop work. Before the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, less than one or two out of ten were operating, most relying on self-installed wood-burning engines, struggling to survive. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, electricity was universally supplied, and now more than 300 factories have resumed work, with a total of more than 5,000 looms. The vicissitudes of change during this period are not worth mentioning. Here is a brief account of the current general situation.

Recent Resumption of Work

The larger-scale Shanghai silk weaving factories, such as Meiya, Dacheng, Xinda, Dangqiang, Rongfeng, Baida, Jiuchang, etc., own seventy or eighty to one or two hundred looms each. Most of the other small factories have ten to thirty or forty looms. At present, electricity is generally supplied, and all factories have started work after connecting to electricity. However, a portion has not fully started work due to the difficulty in hiring workers temporarily, and the high cost of raw materials, with the price of goods not covering costs. In December of last year, there was a strike that lasted for more than twenty days. Later, it was resolved through mediation by the authorities, and work resumed. Most factories closed for the Lunar New Year holiday on January 28th or 29th and resumed work on February 7th or 8th.

Internal Organization of Silk Factories

The organization of a silk factory depends on its size, but the general situation does not go beyond the following sections: The workshop section requires someone familiar with mechanical structures as a foreman to guide the loom workers. The preparation section completes the winding and doubling work. The sizing and dyeing section specializes in sizing and dyeing silk. The pattern-making section plans patterns, draws design papers, and stomps them into flower books. The ironworkers and carpenters are equipped to repair machinery. Others, such as warping, joining threads, reeling ends, shaking yarns, and winding silk, each perform their duties. Furthermore, it is necessary to hire an experienced person who can design and manufacture goods as the factory manager to oversee all affairs within the factory. The development of a factory's operations is greatly related to whether the employed technical personnel are appropriate and whether the management is strict. Ordinary small silk factories are generally simple in organization due to environmental constraints. The factory manager and foreman often take care of both roles, and other work must be hired temporarily. Everything depends on others. If they want to compete in business, they will inevitably be inferior to others.

Products and Production Status

The types of products can be divided into four categories based on raw materials: silk products, rayon products, silk-rayon interwoven products, and yarn-rayon interwoven products. They can also be simply classified as fancy goods, men's goods, and commodity goods. Fancy goods include the currently popular black and white crepe and brocade satin. Pure rayon fabrics, such as black and white crepe, use 100 or 75 matte yarn with a shrinkage pocket structure. Each loom can produce twelve or thirteen meters per day. Brocade satin uses 100 bright yarn, and daily output is about ten meters. Tianxiang silk, Caizhi silk, Weixin crepe, etc., are silk-rayon interwoven products, and each machine can weave twelve meters. Checkered Bi crepe has men's and women's styles. Those woven entirely from silk are better, while silk-rayon interwoven ones are less durable. The production volume per machine is about ten meters. Quilt covers have distinctions between pure silk, rayon, and yarn-rayon interwoven. The width of the loom is one-third wider than ordinary silk looms, and daily production is between five and six meters. Commodity goods such as Hua Jin crepe, feather yarn, and Guangming satin can produce about twenty-five meters per machine. Di ge is woven from yarn and rayon, and the production volume is similar to Hua Jin crepe, etc. However, the amount of production mentioned above still depends on the newness of the loom, the speed of the dobby (fast dobby or guillotine dobby), and the experience of the weaver, and cannot be compared on the same day.

Sales Channels and Raw Material Problems

In the past, the sales channels for silk goods, especially real silk goods, were most extensive in the north. Other groups such as the Guangdong group and the Hankou group also had strong sales channels. The Nanyang group had special sales for Western-style clothing silk and satin, with different colors and patterns from other groups. The local market mostly sells fancy goods. Currently, transportation has not yet returned to its original state, and none of the groups are making large purchases, so sales have not been prosperous. Currently, goods are being shipped to the Sichuan area via airmail parcels, but the volume is not large. In the future, when transportation is smooth, the sales channels for silk goods are expected to be promising. As for raw materials, the sealed warehouse materials have not been fully released, and inventory is dwindling. There is a shortage of goods on the market. For example, rayon is currently only being consumed without a source of supply. Recognizing this, the authorities have ordered Zhongshan Textile Company to sell 1,500 boxes of the sealed rayon to silk weaving factories at a reduced price. Therefore, the market price once declined. Factory silk is one of the export goods, and the price rises with the value of gold. The inventory is decreasing day by day, and holders often hoard goods, creating a panic situation to satisfy their desire for high prices. The situation with raw materials is indeed not good news for silk weaving factories. (Mu Yi)

### Relocation of Secondary and Higher Schools: Ministry of Education Decides on Six Principles, Establishing an Organization in Chongqing to Oversee Relocation

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 3rd] The Ministry of Education convened a meeting on the relocation of secondary and higher schools.

### US to Use Radio for Re-education in Japan

Japanese Education Standards Not High

[US News Agency, San Francisco, 1st] General Clark stated to a special correspondent of the American Broadcasting Corporation on the 26th: In terms of the Japanese post-war problems, the position of radio is very important. Tank is currently the Minister of Education and Information in Tokyo, and from 1943 until assuming his current position, he served as the head of the Intelligence and Education Department of MacArthur Headquarters. According to Tank's words to reporters: Any country that has been poisoned by war education will use radio and other methods to enlighten them on facts such as international understanding and freedom of speech. General Tank and his subordinates used newspapers, magazines, movies, and other tools to conduct re-education in Japan, but the results were not good because the "high cultural standards" boasted by the Japanese were not accurate. The Japanese claim that 99.6% of the population are intellectuals, but in reality, only one in ten people in Tokyo can recite the names of Japanese war criminals on the notification board. It is impossible to implement re-education in Japan without using radio.

### Two Measures for Labor Welfare

— Editor

According to recent reports, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's Labor Department initiated the organization of the "Shanghai Municipal Factory Employee Consumer Cooperative" to supply members with low-priced daily necessities, increase workers' actual wages, and aim to send out goods based on the cost of living. The third preparatory meeting has been convened, attended by representatives from 50 units, including Shanghai Electric Power Company, Telephone Company, Wing On, Fuxin Yarn Factory, Textile Industry, Machinery Industry, and Tobacco Industry Trade Union, who are actively preparing to proceed. The sources of funds include three types, namely (1) factories allocate a certain amount as promotional shares, (2) if there is a welfare fund, a portion may be allocated, and (3) employees subscribe for shares.

At the same time, the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau also has a measure for labor welfare, which is to specially contract with Haiguang Cinema on Haining Road, Minguang Cinema on Zhapu Road, and Shengli Cinema from this month onwards to rotate labor-themed movies every Sunday morning. The content of the films focuses on production and construction, current affairs news, and those related to labor life with educational significance. Tickets are given away for free. Labor groups in this city can send a letter to the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau every Thursday and Friday to obtain them.

These two measures can indeed be said to be suitable for the current environment. The former can solve the material problems of labor life, while the latter can solve the spiritual problems of labor life. Originally, general manufacturers have not failed to think about the welfare of labor. Looking at the labor-management cooperation and all the facilities of foreign manufacturers, it is really enviable. However, because the manufacturers themselves still have many problems that have not been solved, and even reach the point of being exhausted in coping with them, they cannot take care of the welfare of labor for a while. Now that the Social Affairs Bureau is in charge, it can really achieve twice the result with half the effort, so these two initiatives can be said to be a kind of good governance of the Social Affairs Bureau at present.

The former can indeed fundamentally solve the problem of labor life. We hope that the management can be as satisfactory as possible. Then, not only will labor benefit first, but the stability of social order and the cultivation of purchasing power can also achieve considerable effects. As for the latter, we hope that the films shown will be carefully selected. At the same time, if the film business is effective, it can be expanded to other aspects of the supply of spiritual food, such as setting up libraries, holding academic lectures, and publishing beneficial books and reports.

### The Founder of the Stationery and Educational Construction Factory: He Ji Educational Supplies Company

— Xin

Currently, China urgently desires the construction of education. Regarding educational materials, it is imperative to first engage in production construction. As culture becomes increasingly developed and the level of education continuously rises, educational supplies are also gradually becoming more scientific and artistically refined, changing with each passing day. China has long been a country where commerce is not prosperous and science lags behind. Amidst the calls for encouraging production and prioritizing educational construction in nation-building, I am pleased to introduce Mr. Xiaotang, an industrialist with a pragmatic spirit, dedicated to production work, and earnestly assisting education, and Mr. Wang Fuqing, who carries on his aspirations.

Mr. Wang is a respectable industrialist who engages in industrial construction in a down-to-earth manner, without the slightest air of commercialism. He possesses the perseverance and determination necessary for handling affairs. In his early years, Mr. Fuqing studied in Germany. After returning to China, he assisted Mr. Xiaotang in managing the operations of He Ji Educational Supplies Company. He guided the company to be at the forefront of the times with the latest ideas, implemented management with scientific methods, and carried out transactions with innovative and legitimate steps. The company preserved its excellent and reasonable established rules, while resolutely reforming its corrupt and harmful bad habits. As a result, colleagues were invigorated, and business flourished. Under Mr. Wang's management, He Ji established an unshakeable foundation.

During the first ten years after He Ji was founded, Mr. Xiaotang, recognizing the outflow of national currency, engaged in the production of manufacturing plants, specializing in the production of various important educational supplies such as chalk, paper, and ink. They gained countless customers with the principle of "honest goods at fair prices." Stationery merchants from various outports, such as the Sichuan gang, Xi'an gang, Hankou gang, and Changsha gang, sympathized with He Ji's practical transactions and were happy to purchase and sell He Ji's products. As a result, domestic goods were promoted, and considerable profits were recovered. To this day, the "EK" brand printing ink and other products from the China Central Factory still hold a prominent position in the market. This is because He Ji consistently adheres to the principle of "honest goods at fair prices" and practices faithful transactions.

During the January 28th Incident, Mr. Wang's hard work fortunately escaped the artillery fire. However, during the August 13th Incident, as the flames of war raged, the production facilities founded by Mr. Wang could not escape destruction by enemy artillery fire. Unable to do otherwise, he devised a plan to gradually move materials inland, from Hankou to Changsha, then to Hengyang, Chongqing, and Kunming. Following the National Army everywhere, he gradually relocated, further experiencing Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Guiyang, Guilin, and other places, establishing offices in various locations in the hope of maintaining contact. Unfortunately, every place was ravaged by the enemy. The transported goods suffered considerable losses due to bombing or direct involvement in the war. According to Mr. Wang, a batch of inland-moved goods still exists in Zhenhai. In June of last year, just as he was preparing to transport it inland, enemy agents from the so-called Political Security Corps Ningbo Branch considered it aiding the enemy and seized it. After the peace, Mr. Wang requested the Zhejiang authorities to return it, but no results have been seen so far. In total, the damage suffered by the inland-moved goods is substantial. Mr. Wang, with an indomitable spirit, waged a passive resistance against the enemy in terms of materials until peace.

Today, Mr. Wang's spirit is even more aroused, hoping to dedicate his entire strength to nation-building. The businesses destroyed in the past are being revived. He will contribute a large amount of production to the construction of education and work harder to improve business, rigorously organizing personnel, business operations, production, finance, and employee treatment. For example, recently in Shanghai, there has been a wave of strikes and work slowdowns everywhere. The labor and management of the Eight Great Companies and the Commercial Press, among others, have had disputes over unfair treatment. However, He Ji's management has a deep understanding of the labor force, with salaries originally set at a relatively high level, sufficient to maintain the necessities of life. In addition to providing employees with lodging, they also provide suitable housing for employees' families, with employee dormitories, so that employees do not feel the hardship of life. Therefore, every employee is able to [whitespace] , thus enabling the enterprise to [whitespace] into a higher degree of [whitespace]. In short, Mr. Wang wants to [whitespace] He Ji into the most ideal and progressive industrial and commercial entity, making it forever the front [whitespace] of society and always [whitespace] a strong member dedicated to nation-building.

Mr. Wang not only considers the future of He Ji's business, but also holds a greater enthusiasm for the stationery industry and commerce nationwide. He hopes that stationery merchants can unite to organize a research institute dedicated to research work, thoroughly improving the quality and structure of domestic products, competing with imported goods, and recovering the commercial profits of the entire educational supplies industry. I cannot help but be touched by Mr. Wang's enthusiasm. If all industries in our country's business community have the organization and determination to work hard, then the revitalization of Chinese commerce, the construction of industry, and the recovery of the commercial profits of the entire nation can undoubtedly be expected in the near future.

He Ji was founded in the third year of Xuantong (1911), and can be said to be among the earliest founders of the educational supplies industry. During the Xuantong era, China's situation was still quite outdated. Most corrupt-minded Chinese people only knew "the Four Treasures of the Study" as the only stationery. Specialized stationery businesses were rarely seen in Shanghai. At that time, Mr. Xiaotang resolutely founded He Ji Educational Supplies Company, indeed possessing a unique industrial vision. When we further investigate the reasons for his success, these various aspects naturally have value worthy of emulation by later generations. The following points may be important factors in his success:

(1) Honest goods at fair prices, being realistic and pragmatic, without making false propaganda;

(2) Firmly pursuing goals, engaging in the promotion of domestic products, and gaining the sympathy of customers;

(3) Effective management, cooperation between labor and management.

The above points seem very simple, but putting them into practice is not easy. Those with aspirations in industry should take this as a mirror.

Finally, I think it is also worth mentioning Mr. Fuqing's character. His attitude is gentle, his demeanor is refined, and he is usually quiet and taciturn. He not only inherits Mr. Xiaotang's ambition to expand the business, but also wishes to dedicate his business achievements to nation-building. This is truly commendable. Mr. Fuqing also enjoys reading and has a rich collection of books at home. He studied art history extensively in Germany. From this, we know that Mr. Fuqing is not only an industrialist but also a scholar. I have a slight artistic hobby and would like to ask for his guidance someday.

### The Road to Production Construction

— Xu Yusun

Mr. Yusun presides over China's long-standing Jinglun Shirts and Socks Textile Factory, handling it with skill and exporting high-quality products. What this journal describes is indeed targeted at reality and has many practical suggestions worth adopting. Please pay attention, readers - Editor.

Production construction is a primary task necessary for the country's hope for post-war recovery. Half a year has passed since the end of World War II. We look around and see that everything is lacking everywhere in the world. In the past four years, industrialized countries in Europe and America have converted most of their factories into institutions for manufacturing military supplies due to the needs of the war. Large watch factories such as American Hamilton and Elgin have commissioned Swiss watch factories to do their original work. Ero Lingerie Factory has also converted the civilian underwear part into a factory for manufacturing military uniforms. With the end of the war, most of the millions of troops have to return to their original jobs and lives, and with the huge demand for clothing and daily necessities from the general public after four years of war, while the work of refitting factory machinery has not yet been completed, naturally a general shortage of materials has been created. However, in countries with well-developed industrial equipment, restoring production is not very difficult, because technology already has a solution—in fact, with years of manufacturing experience, it has made progress in many ways—and there are no major problems with raw materials and transportation. Embarking on the road of production construction can be realized in a short period.

In our country, talking about production construction after the war is not that simple. The few cities that can be called industrial centers have either been destroyed by artillery fire in the past eight years, or have been plundered into extreme poverty by the puppets. Manufacturers who were fortunate enough to move inland or remain in Shanghai to start work have all reduced their production and sales volume compared to before due to restrictions on raw materials and transportation. Among these factories and technicians in shutdown factories, some have changed careers due to their livelihood, some have reduced their work efficiency due to age, and some have even passed away. Moreover, most of our country's factories are small and medium-sized. After eight years of torment, hardship, and consumption, it is now a bit too much to expect them to rely entirely on their own to restore production and increase production, and in fact it is impossible. The government authorities, in view of this, have a solution for industrial foundation loans. This is good news for factories, and it is a driving force for promoting production construction. However, there are currently several obstacles that we urgently need to eliminate as quickly as possible. Technology, machinery, raw materials, and government assistance are still difficult to smoothly embark on the path of production construction.

Transportation: During the Anti-Japanese War, our country's water and land transportation suffered unprecedented destruction. Recently, the communist army dismantled a part of the repaired railway, making travel and transportation extremely difficult today. China's transportation has regressed at least fifty years! This situation greatly affects the shortage of raw materials and finished materials, fluctuating prices, and imbalances in supply and demand. Therefore, restoring and improving our country's transportation and transportation institutions can almost be considered the first need for production construction.

Monetary System and Foreign Exchange: Before the Supreme National Defense Council passed the opening of the foreign exchange market on February 26, Shanghai's financial economy can be said to have been in a state of chaos. Speculators were afraid that the world would not be in chaos, so they stirred up trouble and created many seemingly true and seemingly false rumors. As a result, prices fluctuated with these rumors, which in turn affected the unstable prices of industrial raw materials such as cotton yarn, cloth, hardware, and chemicals. Factories engaged in production naturally felt great difficulties in the purchase price and cost of goods. Although the government's new foreign exchange regulations cannot completely solve their difficulties, we believe that it can at least curb some speculative behavior and stabilize the prices of goods and raw materials.

The opening of the foreign exchange market case divides the import of foreign goods into three categories: free, licensed, and prohibited. We firmly believe that this is a policy that is helpful to our country's production construction. We hope that the government authorities will determine the details of these three types of foreign goods as soon as possible and strictly implement the established methods. For private factories that actually need foreign machinery and raw materials, and whose products are related to people's livelihood, we hope that the government will provide convenience and preferential treatment in terms of requesting foreign exchange.

Understanding and Cooperation between Officials and the People: We cannot deny that the lack of understanding and cooperation between the government and the people is a major obstacle to production construction. The general business community's view of official policies is: unreasonable, unrealistic, delayed, and demanding, while the government authorities are always wary of the business community's perfunctory behavior, evasion, and lip service. We believe that both sides should be open and honest. The business community should state its own interests, difficulties, and opinions to the officials without any scruples. Before implementing any industrial and commercial laws or tax rules, the government should thoroughly research them based on existing facts, and sometimes invite people in the industry to participate in opinions, so as to avoid causing multiple criticisms as soon as the policies are published, and the result is often to take temporary suspension or revision methods. The government should use facts to show that it [whitespace] understands the difficulties and interests of the business community, and should also use facts to show that it is willing to provide the business community with reasonable and practical assistance and encouragement. The red tape of officialdom is seen as wasteful and delaying by the business community. The simpler and quicker the procedures, the better. In this way, we believe that official-civilian cooperation and understanding can be increased.

### Prospects for the American Production Industry

— Qinghe

The American people have always had [whitespace] great purchasing power, but since the start of World War II, the government implemented extremely supplementary [whitespace] time restrictions, so they could not purchase according to [whitespace] each person's [whitespace], which saved a lot of money, according to statistics, there are as many as 150 billion yuan, the superior instruction [whitespace] money after the end of the war, is about to be used to purchase all kinds of consumables that could not be bought before.

According to the US Department of Commerce survey, the US industrial community has reached an unprecedented level of international awareness, and factories have also decided to allocate 6% to 15% of their total production for export, regardless of the domestic market.

Among all kinds of products, the following types are the most noteworthy, may [whitespace] be divided as follows:

Automobile Industry: According to estimates, by the end of 1946, the national production will reach 6 million vehicles, including 1 million to 1.5 million [whitespace] trucks.

Radio Industry: According to records in 1941, the sales volume of radio receivers in the United States was 13 million units. It is estimated that the demand for radios after the war will increase fourfold compared to 1941.

Electrical Equipment: The demand for electrical equipment is also very large, so large-scale production will be launched in one year. Most electrical industrialists are prepared to export 15% of their products. By 1945, the number of electric water heaters exceeded 150,000 units, and it is expected to increase even more in 1946.

Fertilizer: The consumption of fertilizer in the United States is quite large, and it had increased to 13 million [whitespace] per year by 1942, and will undoubtedly increase even more in 1946.

Vaccines: Since the invention of the vaccine DDT, demand has exceeded supply. It is said that domestic consumption can be satisfied within one year, and then the surplus [whitespace] amount can be exported.

Textiles: The production of textiles in the United States reached its highest [whitespace] in 1942, and then declined due to the war. Large-scale production will be carried out in the future to meet the needs.

### Production Dynamics

New Colloid

A year ago, the advertising director of General Electric threw a pack of cigarettes into the river to a group of newspaper reporters, and after waiting for a while, took it out. After the water stains flowed away, the cigarettes were not damaged at all. The reason for this is the use of a new colloid (Plastic). This is an [whitespace] invention in the last thirty years, [whitespace] Yun [whitespace] Gong's [whitespace] and Chemical Company, Corning Glass Manufacturing [whitespace], and General Electric Company.

The raw materials for this colloid are [whitespace] oil [whitespace] water and sand, [whitespace] [whitespace] into a foggy [whitespace] gas [whitespace], after it is sprayed, it will not get wet, that is, moisture will not penetrate. This spraying method can be applied to cigarettes or other [whitespace].

Using this method, various new [whitespace] things can be made, such as paper bags used by grocers to hold food, temporary rain hats sold in large quantities during ball games, and a kind of colloid that can be applied to light clothing and even leather shoes to get rainproof effect.

Professor Gilpin and students at the University of Nottingham in England studied this colloid, starting forty years ago, and have set a manufacturing plan. Ten years ago, Dr. Sullivan of Corning Glass Manufacturing decided to study the difference between colloids and glass, using Professor Gilpin's research results as a basis. Later, he joined forces with Dehe Chemical Company, and as a result invented a new colloid called Sililone. In the future, in terms of paint, after the harvest is [whitespace] benefit, the heat resistance is very high. At General Electric, it has been tested, even at a high heat of 482 degrees Fahrenheit, there is still no damage at all.

### Absorb New Ideas

— Wang Jing

There is a very good slogan at the University of Chicago's DePaul, which is "The most capable person is the one who can make the best use of outside opinions." Because every industrial and commercial practitioner cannot rely solely on his own creative power, but must refer to and apply outside opinions.

Those novel ideas can be obtained from books, observations, conversations, travels and other opportunities. In fact, such information can be obtained everywhere. As long as you are willing to look for it, you can discover novel facts or reference materials everywhere, which can be applied.

There was a story in the past that, according to the experience of general people [whitespace] [whitespace] zers: it was thought that gold could not be mined [whitespace] on the top of the mountain, but in fact one day a person really obtained a large amount of gold on the top of the mountain. From this example, we can know that as long as you [whitespace] pay attention or work hard to find it, you can get good information everywhere.

Sometimes the information obtained from the outside world can be applied immediately without any further changes, but sometimes it needs to be changed considerably. There was a car manufacturer in the past who went out with his wife to visit a weaving factory and discovered a very good idea, which he applied immediately. Patterson, the originator of adding [whitespace], had the motive of [whitespace] creating adding [whitespace] when he sold coal.

There was a very smart person in the past who used letters to promote electrical and mechanical appliances. In fact, the letters he used were referenced from a letter selling soap, but with slight changes [whitespace] only.

Therefore, in order to record various new ideas at any time, everyone can prepare a small booklet, and when a new idea is discovered, they can write it down and apply it at any time. To make a business always move forward, it needs to be constantly new ideas and new things. The Duke of Windsor once said: "My must be adopted, revised, improved" We Must Acopt Adapt Improve is indeed a wise saying, which can be used as the motto of industrial and commercial practitioners.

### Three Types of Supervisors

— Fu Liangjun

According to the British Efficiency Magazine [whitespace], supervisors can be divided into the following three types. The first type can stand in front of the times and can lead the same industry. The second type seeks progress within the possible scope. The third type will not progress even if someone is pushing it. Therefore, the first type can be said to be the most progressive, the second type can be called still progressive, and the third type is actually backward.

The modern industrial world hopes to have the first type of supervisor who can stand in front of the staff and lead them. If there is a new invention or a new equipment is found, he will immediately apply it. His thinking is always progressing.

At the same time, he not only seeks progress within the scope of the company, but also constantly pays attention to the outside world's dynamics, so his career can improve day by day and can have rapid progress.

As for the second type of person, they can only adapt to the environment, and the third type of person will inevitably be dominated by the environment and cannot [whitespace] be the most developed.

### China Silk Company

— Li

In the previous issue of this journal, we introduced the China Textile Construction Company. Now we will introduce the general situation of the China Silk Company as follows:

The total sauce amount of the China Silk Company, in addition to receiving the enemy and puppet silk assets in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, which were settled by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Agriculture and Forestry, plus 500 million yuan, which was allocated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Agriculture and Forestry in one lump sum. The head office is located in Shanghai, and branch companies, offices, and factory sites can be established in various places at home and abroad. In terms of business scope, it is divided into the following items:

1. Sericulture matters related to silkworm breeding and cultivation, 2. Silk [whitespace]'s [whitespace] manufacturing matters, 3. Processing and weaving matters of natural silk, 4. Transportation and sales matters of finished products, 5. Academic research matters brought about by silkworms and silk, 6. Guidance and encouragement matters for private sericulture businesses.

The directors and supervisors of the company are selected jointly by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Tan Boyu, Tan Xihong, Xue Shouyi, Zhou Yichun, Fa Shenyu, Ma Baozhi, Leng [whitespace],? Fu Cheng, Gao Shiheng, Ge Jingzhong, Tang Xixiang and other eleven people are directors, Chen Yu, Zhang Ziwen. Chang Zonghui, Zheng Qun [whitespace], Shao Shenpei and other five people are supervisors, and Zhou Yichun also serves as chairman, and Ge Jingzhong is hired by the board of directors as general manager.

According to recent news, the company has ordered 2 million mulberry seedlings from Japan in order to restore the mulberry gardens destroyed during the war, and the first batch of 800,000 seedlings arrived in Shanghai the other day, and is discussing with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry on how to handle the accumulation [whitespace].

### Absences Prolong the War

The United States did its best to produce various items during the war. There was a slogan in the Kos, Read wartime factory that said "Absences Prolong the War" Absence Makes The War Grow Longer is indeed a very moving slogan, with profound meaning.

### The Growth and Trial of a Career

— Luo Liqun

No matter what kind of career grows, it will inevitably encounter many difficulties in the process. These difficulties are the trial of the success or failure of the career. When we encounter difficulties, we must overcome this difficult journey. For the career, we must have a deep belief, perseverance, and calm [whitespace] handling. When Feilun Money Factory was first established, because the matter was a pioneering one, it inevitably encountered many difficulties, but because it adhered to its purpose, it finally solved many difficulties. For example, after the August 13th Incident, many factories in Shanghai were either disbanded or moved inland. Feilun Factory now has no way to move inland, and sales have stalled. As a result, it gained new development in Nanyang. However, after the Pacific War broke out, sales were interrupted. Then, the purchase of gauze and raw materials became a problem again, but even under difficult circumstances, it worked hard and finally overcame the difficulties. Therefore, due to past experience, I feel that any difficulty can be solved. I think everyone engaged in industry has the same feeling.
