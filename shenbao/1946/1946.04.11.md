### Gilun, Qin Dechun, and Others Arrive in Beiping, Immediately Fly to Shenyang to Investigate the Truth; Solution to be Negotiated Upon Return

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] The Chongqing Military Trio of Gilun, Qin Dechun, and Chen Shiqu, who conveyed Zhou Enlai's opinions, along with five other members, a total of eight people, arrived in Beiping at 2:30 PM today on a US military aircraft. Those welcoming them at the Xiyuan Airport included Mayor Xiong Bin, Chief of Staff of the Xingying (Military Headquarters) Wang Hongshao, Chief of Staff of the Chief of Staff Office Song Kentang, Executive Department Members Zheng Jiemin and Rao Bosen, Deputy Commander of the Beiping Garrison Hu Bohan, and over a hundred journalists. After disembarking, Gilun, Qin Dechun, and Chen Shiqu proceeded by car to the Xiehe Auditorium to listen to the Executive Department's work report. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM, and the three parties held separate meetings: the government side at the Executive Yuan's Beiping Office, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) at Ye Jianying's residence, and the US side within the Executive Department at Xiehe Hospital. In the evening, the three Executive Department members hosted a banquet for the trio at Cuihualou Restaurant. The trio will fly to Shenyang on the 11th, at which time Ye Jianying may go in place of Zhou Enlai due to illness. Chen Shiqu's visit was to convey Zhou Enlai's opinions to Ye Jianying and not to participate in the trio. Qin Dechun stated that Minister Chen was suffering from stomach illness, so he was temporarily substituting for him. The trio's trip to Shenyang is to gather materials, understand the truth of the Northeast situation, and then negotiate a detailed solution to the Northeast problem upon their return. Therefore, they did not bring a specific plan for the Executive Department to follow. They will stay in Shenyang for a few days and do not plan to inspect other places, returning to Beiping and then to Chongqing.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] Qin Dechun, the mayor who presided over Beiping's municipal affairs before the July 7th Incident, revisited Beiping on the 10th as a member of the Military Trio. Reflecting on the past, Qin expressed to reporters that he felt extremely pleased because justice had triumphed over power. He spoke very cautiously about the Northeast mediation issue, saying that the situation in the Northeast was not yet clear and that Chongqing had not made any decisions on this matter. He would go to Shenyang to see and then talk, hoping that the problem could be resolved rationally.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] CCP representative Chen Shiqu, a major general who came to Beiping to convey Zhou Enlai's opinions, told reporters after the CCP meeting at Ye Jianying's residence today: (1) An agreement was reached last month to first stop the conflict and then resolve the Northeast issue through negotiation. No more concrete solution to the Northeast issue has emerged since then. Chen explained that the troop movements of both armies in the Northeast should be stopped immediately, and other handover issues should be discussed after the conflict ceases. When asked by reporters about General Zhu De's previous statement that he did not oppose the National Army taking over the Northeast, and what the CCP's attitude would be towards the National Army taking over the Northeast in the future, Chen replied: I do not remember the CCP making such a statement. (2) Regarding the troop reduction issue, Chen said: The list of CCP troops to be retained after the troop reduction, which the CCP should submit, is currently being discussed at a meeting in Yan'an. The CCP army has already begun demobilization. As of April 15th, the 900,000 field army can be reduced by one-third.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] Marshall will return to China soon, so Zhou Enlai is staying in Chongqing to meet with Marshall and will not come to Beiping. According to CCP Major General Chen Shiqu, another important reason for Zhou's absence from Beiping is that the plane that flew to Yan'an on the 8th crashed near Xi'an. Wang Ruofei, Qin Bangxian, Ye Ting, and Deng Fa, the CCP representative returning from the labor conference in Europe, were all killed. Zhou needs to handle these matters in Chongqing. Moreover, the CCP currently has only Zhou and Lu Dingyi as representatives in Chongqing, and he can hardly leave. Chongqing still has many matters that Zhou needs to discuss with various parties.

[United Press Chongqing Dispatch, 10th] There is a new development in the internal situation of China today. The Military Trio flew to Beiping by special plane at 9:00 AM today and then transferred to Pan (?), to personally investigate the Northeast conflict. The 28th Executive Subgroup in Shenyang traveled to Sipingjie by car yesterday. In Chongqing, the Democratic League acted as mediator, inviting leaders from both the Nationalists and Communists to a meeting today to discuss a thorough solution to the Northeast ceasefire.

At Dehui Station, Wu Wenfu, a member of the delegation, photographed a Communist Army guard wearing a red and white armband. The guard stood at attention, allowing the photo to be taken. After the photo was taken, they smiled at each other but did not speak.

### Although the Trio Reached an Agreement, No Progress in Shandong; Chen Yi Invited to Jinan for Discussions

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 10th] After the Jinan Executive Subgroup exchanged views with the military and political authorities here on the 6th and reached an agreement, there is hope for clarifying the situation in Shandong. However, as of now, there has been no concrete action to thoroughly implement the various provisions of Annex 6 of the Peace Agreement, and the repair work on the railways in Shandong is still stalled. Therefore, general observers are not entirely optimistic. The Executive Subgroup is facing a difficult situation given the development of this dull situation and has telegraphed Commander Chen Yi of the New Fourth Army, inviting him to fly to Jinan to discuss everything in person, hoping to resolve the Shandong issue as soon as possible to relieve the suffering of the people.

### Chairman Chiang is in Guiyang; Personally Inspects the Provincial Government and Provincial Party Headquarters Yesterday; Delivers an Inspiring Speech at Guizhou University

[Central News Agency Guiyang Dispatch, 10th] Chairman Chiang arrived in Guiyang on the 9th and spent a peaceful night. At 9:30 AM on the 10th, he first drove to inspect the Guizhou Provincial Government. Chairman Yang Sen personally led all the department heads and about 200 staff members of the provincial government to welcome him in front of the provincial government. The Chairman's car arrived at the provincial government amidst the welcoming music. The welcoming personnel stood at attention and paid their respects, and the Chairman nodded in response. Yang immediately led the department heads to accompany him, and after a brief rest in the reception room, he inquired briefly about the civil administration and transportation situation in Guizhou Province. He then inspected the various offices of the provincial government and the Guizhou Provincial Security Command adjacent to the provincial government. He then drove to inspect the Guizhou Provincial Party Headquarters and then drove to the scenic area of Huaxi, 18 kilometers from Guiyang, for sightseeing. Yang accompanied him. He arrived at 10:40 AM and stayed there for four hours. He visited the orphans of the late Division Commander Dai Anlan to express his condolences and went to the National Guizhou University, where he gave a cordial and inspiring speech to the faculty and students in the school auditorium, revealing that Guizhou is an important town in the southwest, and that the construction of Guizhou requires talent, and that efforts should be made to enrich the school so that it becomes a modern institution of learning. After the speech, all the faculty and students cheered and applauded for three minutes. The Chairman then happily left the school and returned to his residence to rest. He returned to Guiyang at 2:30 PM. The special car inspected the Guizhou branch of the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League in the city and then returned to the Qianlingshan residence at 3:30 PM. After dinner, he took a sedan chair to visit Qianlingshan, appearing very happy.

[Another Dispatch] Chairman Chiang visited Guizhou University at about 1:00 PM this afternoon and summoned President Zhang and the deans and training directors of each college to inquire about school affairs. He was extremely concerned about the living conditions of all the faculty and students. He then gave a brief speech to more than 1,000 faculty and students, saying: "When I came to your school on the 7th, I was very pleased to see that the students were energetic and healthy. Thinking back to eleven years ago, when I first came to Guizhou, most of the people of Guizhou were addicted to opium, which caused them to be pale and thin, and weak. Today, the general youth are healthy and lively, and the situation feels like another world. From this, it can be seen that our Guizhou compatriots have made rapid progress. This is what I am most comforted by. Now, Guizhou's economic position is not as good as Sichuan and Yunnan, but Guizhou is located in the center of the southwestern provinces, with an important location and abundant mineral resources. If we can work hard to develop and intensify construction, it will surely become an important town in the southwest and an important base for national rejuvenation. When I came to Guizhou in the 24th year (of the Republic, 1935), I had four major wishes for Guizhou, namely (1) eradicating opium, (2) developing mineral resources, (3) developing transportation, and (4) improving culture. Now, except for the first item, which has been largely completed, the other three items are either in progress or have not yet started. Your school is a school of Guizhou and often cultivates talents for Guizhou as cadres for building a new Guizhou. I will find ways to enrich the school's facilities and make it a modern school. At the same time, I also hope that all the faculty and students of the school will work hard, endure hardship, settle down to teach, and cultivate a spirit of perseverance and acquire modern scientific knowledge, and then fulfill my wishes and build a new Guizhou based on the Three Principles of the People."

Chairman Chiang's Remarks to Foreign Reporters Before Leaving Chongqing

[United Press Chongqing Dispatch, 8th] (Delayed) Chairman Chiang said when he received United Press reporters today: If the United States continues to undertake its task of leading the world, the United Nations organization can succeed. China stands behind the United Nations organization with an upright attitude, but currently the leaders of the Chinese government do not believe that peace can be maintained solely by relying on the United Nations organization without the active support of the democratic countries. All countries in the world must always be vigilant to maintain the democratic system. The Chairman believes that a united government in the Nationalists-Communists talks can be achieved in the short term. He also clarified that the Communist Party and other parties should dedicate themselves to the welfare of China as a whole and should not make attempts at "internal sabotage." The Chairman looked radiant and very healthy when he received the United Press reporters. Regarding the issue of Sino-Soviet relations, the Chairman said: Last August, China concluded the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance with friendly sincerity, and hopes to abide by the provisions of the treaty. Regarding the domestic situation, he is not pessimistic about the future due to inflation, economic disorder, and a certain degree of social unrest. He continued to say that transportation has been restored and that supplies from abroad are also coming in, and that the situation should improve in a few months. The economic recovery of China depends almost entirely on the speed with which the urgently needed materials supplied by the United States are shipped. If a new government can be formed and the domestic situation allows, he hopes to visit the United States, at which time he will stay in the United States for at least one month. The interview lasted for more than an hour.

### Wu Guozhen and Liu Kai Answer Foreign Reporters; Sino-US Trade Agreement to be Signed Soon; Puyi to be Handed Over in Shenyang or Changchun

[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 10th] A reception for foreign reporters was held at 3:00 PM this afternoon, hosted by Minister Wu Guozhen and Vice Minister Liu Kai. The main questions and answers are recorded as follows: Question: What is the current situation of the withdrawal of Chinese troops from Vietnam? Answer: According to the troop figures on March 1, half of the Chinese troops stationed in Vietnam have already withdrawn, and the rest are also in the process of withdrawing. Question: Did the former Emperor Bao Dai of Annam come to Chongqing to have political talks with the Chinese government? Answer: Bao Dai's visit to Chongqing was purely a private visit and had nothing to do with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He paid his respects to Chairman Chiang the week before. Question: How is the negotiation of the Sino-US trade agreement progressing? Answer: Most of the Sino-US trade agreement negotiations have been agreed upon, and the official signing date is not far away. Question: What is the current situation of the conflict in the Northeast? Answer: Regarding the Northeast issue, the relevant documents should be based on three items: (1) the Sino-Soviet Treaty, which stipulates that the sovereignty of the Northeast should be taken over by the government; the remaining two documents are (2) the order to cease military conflict and restore traffic jointly promulgated on January 10, which stipulates that the National Army will enter the Northeast or move within the nine provinces of the Northeast in order to restore Chinese sovereignty, and is not subject to any restrictions; and (3) the agreement reached by the three-person meeting on March 8 on sending an executive subgroup to the Northeast. As long as the CCP follows the provisions of the above three documents, does not obstruct the National Army from taking over the areas evacuated by the Soviet Army, and does not attack the areas already entered by the National Army, there is no possibility of conflict in the Northeast. Question: What is the situation of Puyi's extradition? Answer: The Soviet ambassador previously informed our government that the Soviet side was prepared to hand over Puyi to the Chinese government, and the two sides are currently discussing the handover in Shenyang, but it may also be held in Changchun.

### Marshall to Return to China This Weekend; Continues Efforts to Promote Nationalist-Communist Cooperation; New York Rumors Marshall to be Appointed Secretary of State

[United Press Washington Dispatch, 9th] The achievements of President Truman's special envoy Marshall in promoting peace in China are on the verge of disintegration during his return to the country to report on his work. The dispute between the Nationalists and Communists has arisen again. The Communist Party accuses the Kuomintang of failing to implement the agreements established by the Political Consultative Conference, and the government also accuses the Communist Army of preventing the National Army from taking over the Northeast. Special Envoy Marshall, in view of this unfavorable development, is now planning to return to his post early. Once Special Envoy Marshall returns to his post in China, what will be presented to the world will at least be an apparent cessation of hostilities between the Nationalists and Communists. The fact that the quarrels between the Nationalists and Communists became active again during Marshall's absence from office shows that the various reforms promoted in China are not yet profound. After returning to the country, Marshall made it clear in public and private conversations that he believed that China's peace depended half on the world's approval and half on its own revival and development. Marshall seems to be planning to carry this through to the end until full success is achieved.

[Central News Agency Washington Dispatch, 9th] Marshall again solemnly declared his previous testimony when attending the Pearl Harbor incident hearing on the morning of the 9th, that President Roosevelt did not call him on the night of December 6, 1941, and that he did not attend the White House staff meeting that night. He also denied hearing that President Roosevelt planned to issue a warning to Japan on December 9 if the US edict to the Japanese Emperor was ignored. The hearing was adjourned until the morning of the 11th. Marshall may appear in court again before going to China this weekend.

[United Press New York Dispatch, 9th] The International Statistical Bureau predicted today that US Special Envoy to China General Marshall will soon succeed Byrnes as Secretary of State. The forecast also said that the future changes in the US State Department will affect Japan, and that a tougher policy than MacArthur's will be adopted. In addition, after the US military withdraws from China, the United States will increase economic and technical assistance to the Chinese National Government, and China, with the support of the United States, will refuse to recognize the Soviet Union's purchase of equipment previously owned or controlled by Japan in the Northeast.

### The Aviation Committee is Searching for the Plane Wang Ruofei and Others Were On; The Government Has Telegraphed Shaanxi and Sichuan Provinces for Assistance

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Chongqing News: Two to three US aircraft circled over the Qinling Mountains near Xi'an and the border between Sichuan and Shaanxi this morning, searching for the US transport plane that went missing on the 8th. The government has urgently telegraphed the governments of Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, ordering border counties to assist in the search. It is reported that the plane was carrying Wang Ruofei, Qin Bangxian (i.e., Qin Bogu), Ye Ting, and other fourteen people, as well as important documents carried by Wang and his party. It is reported that a US plane has discovered traces of airplane wreckage similar to the one near the foothills of Zhongtiaoshan, and the search area has been expanded to Shanxi Province on the other side of the Yellow River. According to people in the aviation industry, the relevant parties in Chongqing may obtain the truth about the plane's accident and the location of the crash in the next day or two, but if it was not a forced landing and the accident occurred in the mountainous areas near the Qinling Mountains, the prognosis is not good.

[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 10th] The US plane carrying CCP representatives Wang Ruofei, Qin Bangxian, and Ye Ting to Yan'an took off from Chongqing on the morning of the 8th. After passing Xi'an at noon, it lost contact with the ground and there has been no news so far. All parties are extremely concerned about this. General Zhou Zhirou, director of the Aviation Committee, specially dispatched two reconnaissance planes at 1:00 PM this afternoon to search along the way. However, due to the bad weather, the ground was blurred and unclear when viewed from the air, so the two planes returned midway. According to Director Zhou, he will continue to dispatch planes to search on the 11th.

### Japanese Technicians and Korean Residents Ordered to Be Sent Away by a Deadline

[United Press Beiping, 10th] He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army, suddenly issued two orders: one ordering the repatriation of Japanese technicians retained for use in China's industry, and the other ordering all Korean residents to immediately leave China and return to their country, causing the authorities in the Eleventh War Zone and those in charge of repatriation to work day and night without a moment to spare. This order reverses the policy of retaining technicians and sets an urgent deadline for Korean residents, which is particularly unexpected. There are no fewer than 50,000 to 60,000 Korean residents in North China, all of whom are required to go to Tianjin to board ships before April 15. The 1,700 people concentrated in the Beiping area have already taken the train to Tianjin this morning, but the others are not yet prepared to immediately comply with the order. The Korean Residents' Association and the Korean Comfort Mission representing the Provisional Government of Seoul have protested, saying that the deadline is so urgent that the residents will not have enough time to take care of their personal affairs and dispose of their property. There are already 15,000 to 25,000 Koreans in the Beiping area alone. Both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have recently been competing to hire technicians for railways and industry. It is estimated that there are no fewer than 5,000 to 6,000 Japanese technicians willing to stay in North China for employment by military agencies. There are currently 50,000 Japanese prisoners and residents in Tianjin waiting to be repatriated.

### UN Security Council Decides to Temporarily Shelve the Iran and Spain Issues – Iran Firmly Requests to Keep It on the Agenda – Meeting Declares Indefinite Recess

[United Press New York, 9th] At today's meeting of the United Nations Security Council, both the Iran and Spain issues were raised, but both were shelved indefinitely. Soviet representative Gromyko returned to his seat and requested the withdrawal of the Iran case. The Council immediately declared an indefinite recess.

[United States Information Service New York, 9th] Iranian Ambassador Ala wrote to United Nations Secretary-General Lie today, stating in brief: I am instructed to state that the position of the Iranian government is no different from that announced at the Security Council on April 4, 1946. Our government hopes that the issue raised by Iran to the Security Council will continue to be included in the agenda in accordance with the resolution of that meeting on April 4, 1946.

[United Press New York, 10th] Officials from various delegations to the United Nations predicted today that the Soviet Union's proposal to the Security Council to withdraw the Iran case would inevitably fail. However, the matter seems to be subject to fierce debate, and both the United States and Britain oppose the Soviet proposal. Iran's formal declaration in a letter to the Council opposing the Soviet proposal has strengthened the positions of the United States and Britain. The members of the Council have scheduled a secret meeting today to discuss the location of the United Nations headquarters. Several representatives privately expressed their dissatisfaction with the current location at Hunter College, and the headquarters may be moved from New York to San Francisco or Geneva, Switzerland.

[United Press New York, 9th] Soviet representative Gromyko, who previously refused to attend the Security Council meetings discussing the Iran issue to show his opposition, today returned to the meeting with US representative Stettinius and rejoined the meeting. However, Iranian Ambassador to the United States Ala was no longer seen in the audience. Today, the Council devoted itself to discussing the issue of changing its rules of procedure, which was the 31st meeting of the Council, starting at 8:06 pm. All national representatives attended, except for Mexican Foreign Minister Najera, who was undergoing a physical examination at a hospital in Baltimore. The chairman of the Rules of Procedure Drafting Committee reported on the committee's work and proposed 23 rules of procedure, supplementing the 15 rules of procedure adopted at the London conference in January. The Council first submitted the first to fifth articles for discussion, including a provision that the Council should hold regular meetings at least once every two weeks. In addition, regular meetings were held, attended by foreign ministers, heads of government, or their representatives. Stettinius said: The United States fully agrees to hold these regular meetings twice a year. Later, based on Gromyko's motion, the Council decided to convene at least 11 presidents, prime ministers, or foreign ministers of member states twice a year to hold meetings. The article in the rules of procedure stipulating that the Council should hold regular meetings at least once every two weeks was also approved by the Council.

### Troops from Various Provinces are Withdrawing – The Soviet Iron Circle in Iran Disappears – Soviet Troops Have Also Begun to Retreat from Greater Tabriz

[Associated Press Tehran, 10th] The iron circle that Soviet troops have arranged in northern Iran for four years is now rapidly disappearing.

### General Election Held Throughout Japan Yesterday – Women Voted Enthusiastically – Democratic Politics Undergoing First Test – Orderly Under Allied Supervision

[This Newspaper Tokyo, 10th] This morning, Tokyo newspapers gave great importance to Japan's general election. Early in the morning, American military police drove various vehicles on the streets, each equipped with two loudspeakers, with Japanese personnel shouting, "People, don't forget to vote for your own candidates." Forty Allied journalists, along with General Whitney, Director of the Government Section of MacArthur Headquarters, went to various polling stations. Most of the polling stations were located in national schools. Japan's general election was presided over by the American occupation forces, so there was one American soldier at each polling station to maintain order.

[United Press Tokyo, 10th] Japan held a general election today, which ended at 6:00 pm. The most orderly election in Japanese history has been completed. Based on the number of votes that have not yet been counted, it is estimated that 65% to 70% of the electors in Tokyo City voted. The percentage of votes in several important rural areas is slightly higher than in Tokyo. If the final count is consistent with the above figures, then the number of votes in this general election will be greatly reduced compared to the forced vote in the 1942 general election, and only slightly better than the semi-restricted vote in the 1937 general election. This morning, the polling stations in Tokyo were crowded with people. Some Japanese political observers who originally expected that 75% of the voters would vote have changed their views, thinking that it would exceed this number, but there were fewer voters in the afternoon. More women voted than expected. In Tokyo City, it has exceeded 50%, while it was originally expected to be just over 25%. At the same time, the exact results of the general election will not be known until tomorrow. The ballot counting will begin at 8:00 am tomorrow, and some results will be known that night. There are still many men and women who applied for blank ballots, but they cannot vote due to recent population migration and incomplete registration. Based on this situation, the Japanese Communist Party has marched several times, demanding a new election, and may be more determined to re-raise this demand in the future. As of 3:00 pm, about 50.5% of male and female electors in Tokyo have voted, and the voting percentage in the areas near Tokyo is roughly the same, but so far, the voting statistics in Japan are incomplete. There were no accidents during the voting in Tokyo today. Bower, the British member of the Four-Power Control Commission for Japan, went to inspect the four important districts of Tokyo this afternoon and talked with the officials in charge of the election work, and saw that the voting situation was very peaceful and orderly.

[Associated Press Tokyo, 10th] It is the first time in history that Japanese women have participated in the election. Before the election, it was predicted that the number of people who would abstain from voting would be between 60% and 70%, but based on the situation of women voting this morning, the number of women who abstained from voting will be roughly between 30% and 40%, which is beyond the general expectation. According to Kyodo News, as of 2:00 pm today, 65% to 70% of the 36 million voters in Japan have voted.

[Agence France-Presse Tokyo, 10th] Japan held its first general election in ten years today. Residents of Tokyo went to the polling stations to vote under the dark sky. There were many women and girls in the voting crowd. Most of the polling stations are located in schools, and the ballot boxes are placed on white wooden tables, with Japanese officials and American inspectors supervising the voting. A reporter from this agency asked an elderly worker why he voted in favor of the Socialist Party. The old man replied, "I really don't know." Another 52-year-old unemployed person also voted in favor of the Socialist Party. It is said that "I used to vote for Asanuma, and I don't want to change now." Most residents of Tokyo apparently voted in favor of the Socialist Party, but this situation is true in large cities. Farmers in all parts of the country follow the traditional practice and support the successors of the old Minseito and Seiyukai, namely the current Progressive Party and Liberal Party. As of 2:00 pm today, voters have accounted for 75% of the total number. After the new parliament is elected, a special meeting will be held on May 10 to discuss the new constitution and budget bill.

### MacArthur Government Restores Customs Affairs Today

[This Newspaper Tokyo, 10th] There are rumors here that the Liberal Party bribed women, but there is still no concrete evidence. Yesterday, six Liberal Party members hosted a banquet for hundreds of voters, asking them to allow the election of Liberal Party candidates, but all six of them have been arrested by the police.

Editorial

### Extinguish the Tinder of the Northeast!

Despite the National Government's efforts to strive for domestic peace for more than seven months, and despite the people's day and night prayers for sincere unity among all parties to achieve domestic peace and unification, it ultimately seems impossible to stop the Chinese Communist Party, which is prone to creating chaos, from launching its long-plotted disturbances. Despite the fact that we, both the government and the public, believe that the Northeast issue is a diplomatic issue, and we have exercised forbearance and restraint, compromising to achieve the guarantee that Soviet troops will completely withdraw from the nine provinces of the Northeast by the end of this month through diplomatic efforts, we ultimately cannot influence the Chinese Communist Party to refrain from taking advantage of the difficult diplomatic environment to hinder the National Government's reception of sovereignty over the Northeast. Under such circumstances, the situation in the Northeast has become even more tense with the withdrawal of Soviet troops. Chinese and foreign personages alike already believe that the overall situation in the Northeast in the next ten days may affect the safety of the overall situation in China; and according to yesterday's news, we sincerely fear that if the tinder of the Northeast's disturbances is not quickly extinguished with a quick and decisive approach, the disaster of a prairie fire will be imminent!

From the Chongqing telegrams, we briefly read the absurd arguments of the CCP's Liberation Daily and New China Daily, which actually slander Mr. Chiang, the head of state and leader of the War of Resistance, as "colluding with the enemy, selling the country, and compromising to surrender." No ordinary person would believe their propaganda. However, why are they making such "excessive propaganda," as the Ta Kung Pao says? Their purpose is nothing more than to create a reason for their impending rebellion. Therefore, the Chongqing World Daily criticizes that "the CCP is no longer a domestic political party organized by Chinese people, but a group of rioters who are entirely carrying out the duties of a fifth column for foreign countries," which is truly a pointed and insightful argument. We believe that this absurd argument is a signal that the CCP intends to play with fire in the Northeast and even throughout the country. We must not allow them to play with fire again, and we must quickly extinguish the tinder of the Northeast.

Looking again at the remarks made by Wu Xiuquan, the chief of staff of Lin Biao, the leader of the communist army in the Northeast, to a United Press reporter in Shenyang on the 8th, he actually advocated that the areas of the Northeast from which Soviet troops withdraw should be jointly taken over by the armies of the KMT and the CCP. He even dared to say that although the Sino-Soviet Treaty stipulates that the Central Government's army should take over from the Soviet army, this is a matter between the Soviet Union and the Central Government, and in some areas of the Northeast, the local people have already formed a communist army. Therefore, regarding the issue of takeover, the local communist party has organized a "People's Government" and has already taken over in the name of the people, and there is no need for the national army to enter. Wu's intention in his remarks is obvious: to use the guise of the "People's Government" to obstruct the national army's takeover. What is this if not deliberately trying to secede the Northeast and split the country? What other purpose is there in creating a pretext to raise the banner of treason in the Northeast? As far as the CCP is concerned today, they are full of confidence that they have planted explosives in the Northeast, waiting only for the fuse to explode.

We, the common people, have long been impatient with this situation after the victory. For example, with a sick person, it is best not to have surgery, but if the illness is dangerous and surgery is unavoidable, only surgery offers hope of recovery. We really don't understand why the government is delaying it so long! According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the takeover of the Northeast was originally the National Government's responsibility. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty concerned the Soviet Government for the Soviet Union and the National Government for China. The withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Northeast should have been followed by the national army taking over the defense, which was an unquestionable matter. Before the power of the National Government had reached the Northeast, any organization or army in the area, if not recognized by the National Government, was an illegal organization and an illegal army. From a strictly righteous standpoint, the national army should have quickly eliminated such illegal organizations and illegal armies. In fact, if these organizations and armies without legal basis still appear in the Northeast, this is precisely enough to show the government's magnanimity and forbearance for the sake of the country. However, the common people only know that the National Government is the sole legal government of China, representing all the people of China, and no matter what nice words the local "People's Government" borrows, it cannot represent all the people of China. The Northeast is a part of our country's territory, the Northeast of the Chinese people, not the Northeast of the people of the Northeast, let alone the Northeast of some who borrow names. The National Government represents all the people of China to go to take over, which is just and righteous, and any resistance should be overcome.

The Communist Party has always had a consistent style, which is to insist that the national army's purpose is not to resist foreign enemies but to suppress domestic opposition. Wu's claim that the national army's purpose in entering the Northeast is to eliminate the communist army's forces does not need to be refuted by us. Regarding the situation in the Northeast, the CCP has repeatedly attempted to transform it into a domestic political issue. In the past few months, CCP troops have entered the Northeast from Rehe and the Shandong Peninsula, with the aim of establishing a base for treason and creating a fait accompli in order to prevent the national army from taking over. We are indeed regretful that the Northeast, under the occupation of friendly Soviet troops, has allowed this situation to arise; the CCP's obstruction of the national army's takeover under such circumstances is particularly sinister in its intention. This is clearly a poisonous scheme to sell out national interests in order to expand its own territorial power! After China's long war of resistance, the traitors who sold out national interests have all been imprisoned and will soon be brought to justice under the law. Yet at this moment, there are still people who disregard national interests and attempt to undermine the National Government's takeover of the Northeast, and attempt to undermine the integrity of our country's territory and sovereignty. In their hearts, how are they any different from the traitors of the past?

At this moment, we must solemnly inform our allies: the CCP's consistent style is to undermine China's unification and expand its own power, leading China in a direction that the Chinese people do not want to go. Its purpose is incompatible with the interests of the Chinese people and the interests of our allies. We cannot let it continue to act so recklessly! The peace of the world depends on the Far East, and the peace of the Far East depends on a strong China under the leadership of the Chinese Kuomintang. Supporting the development of the CCP in China is contrary to the interests of the Chinese people, the peace of the world, and the interests of our allies. Marshal Marshall will soon return to China, and we hope that this situation in which the CCP deliberately plays with fire in the Northeast can be fundamentally changed. We especially hope that the tinder of the Northeast can be quickly extinguished in the near future.

### The City Provisional Council Concluded Successfully Yesterday; Closing Ceremony Held Yesterday; Listening to Replies from Central Government Agencies to Various Inquiries; Mayor Qian Hosted a Banquet for All Councilors in the Evening, and They Dispersed in High Spirits

The City Provisional Council held its thirteenth general meeting at 9:00 AM yesterday. Speaker Xu Jiqing presided over the meeting. The Secretariat reported on three items: (1) Twenty-six councilors were present, meeting the legal quorum; (2) The reports and review opinions from the Social Affairs, Health, and Education Bureaus have been sent to the Secretariat; (3) The minutes of the twelfth general meeting were read, followed by discussion of proposals. Draft resolutions on the work reports of various bureaus were passed.

Central Government Agencies Respond to Inquiries

After the discussions were completed, representatives from three agencies were invited to attend the meeting and respond to inquiries: the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Food for the Beijing-Shanghai Region, the Bureau for Handling Enemy and Puppet Industries in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region, and the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region. After the councilors raised their inquiries, the central government agencies responded separately. First, Shen Guanya, the representative from the Bureau for Handling Enemy and Puppet Industries in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region, responded, dividing the content into three categories: (1) Regarding the resumption of factory operations, the takeover of factories is primarily handled by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. However, among the factories already taken over, some have not yet resumed operations due to unresolved property disputes. (2) Regarding the handling of housing, the bureau has taken over a total of 8,000 buildings, including 3,000 enemy properties and 300 puppet properties. Of the enemy and puppet properties, apart from over 300 buildings planned for allocation to agencies relocating to Shanghai from the rear, the rest are intended for sale. As for the more than 4,000 civilian houses, most have unresolved property disputes. In the future, the bureau will consult with the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Third Military Region, and other relevant agencies to discuss handling methods. In principle, priority will be given to introducing civil servants relocating to Shanghai from the rear for rental purposes. (3) Regarding the clearing of warehouses, since November 9th of last year, after inspecting warehouses, over 1,000 locations have been inventoried. As for the goods stored in the warehouses, apart from a portion of miscellaneous grains, most have rotted, which is also a fact. The reason for the rotting is due to prolonged storage in the past, and not due to negligent management after the takeover. The above-mentioned goods are currently being sorted out. Next, Li Chongnian and Wang Daren, representatives from the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Food for the Beijing-Shanghai Region, responded, stating: (1) Adequate food reserves have been properly arranged by President Song and Minister Xu in consultation with Shanghai's gentry and merchants. (2) Fluctuations in grain prices cannot be attributed to a single cause, but insufficient grain supply is indeed a major factor. The whole world is currently experiencing famine, which is not unique to our country. (3) The amount of enemy and puppet grain received is very small. Finally, Guo Kexi, representative from the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, responded, stating: (1) Most factories were shut down at the time of takeover, but have now gradually resumed operations. (2) This office has taken over 626 factory units, transferred 142 units, resumed operations in 103 units, returned 148 units, and auctioned off 176 units. Only 57 units have not yet had a decision made on how to handle them. (3) Regarding the placement of workers, both Shanghai workers and workers relocating to Shanghai from Chongqing will be considered and handled fairly. After listening to the responses from the representatives of various agencies, the councilors still felt that the content was too brief and repeatedly raised questions, requesting the general assembly to forward them to the relevant central government agencies for further written responses. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.

Election of Seven Resident Committee Members

The fourteenth meeting and closing ceremony were held in the afternoon. Thirty-six people, including Speaker, Vice Speaker, and councilor Feng Youzhen, attended in a lively atmosphere. Speaker Xu Jiqing presided over the meeting. Li Guiyong and Yan Ze, representatives from the Shanghai Branch of the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, reported on the work since its establishment and the receipt of relief materials. Subsequently, proposals were discussed, and were passed, amended, or reserved accordingly. After a ten-minute break, seven resident committee members were elected. As a result of the election, Feng Youzhen, Xu Shihao, Shen Chunhui, Wang Yansong, Fu Tongxian, Zhou Xuexiang, and Zhu Su'e were elected as resident committee members.

Emergency Motion Introduced

Subsequently, Councilor Feng Youzhen introduced an emergency motion, appealing to the Communist Party to consider the overall situation, abandon its conspiracies to create chaos, and requesting the National Government to take effective steps to resolutely prevent it, in order to safeguard the foundation of the country. It was unanimously passed by a show of hands, creating a lively and tense atmosphere. At the same time, Councilor Feng also drafted a telegram to the Chairman and telegrams to Mr. Mao Zedong, Mr. Zhu De, and other members of the Communist Party. These telegrams were also passed at the general meeting (telegrams recorded separately). Then, a declaration was passed (see below). The fourteenth general meeting then concluded.

Closing Ceremony; Mayor's Address

At 6:30 PM, the closing ceremony was held, presided over by Speaker Xu. After performing the ceremony, Xu delivered a closing address, praising the councilors' spirit of deliberation and expressing his satisfaction with the successful conclusion of the meeting. He also hoped that after the recess, they would continue to work hard, provide opinions at any time, and assist in municipal construction to benefit the citizens. Then, Mayor Qian delivered an address, briefly stating: The council is the body for formulating plans, and the municipal government is the agency for implementing these plans. Today, on behalf of the municipal government, I guarantee that all resolutions of your council will be thoroughly implemented by the municipal government. Although your council has now adjourned, the responsibility of collective discussion by you gentlemen is over, but the responsibility of you gentlemen to assist and supervise is not lifted due to the adjournment. I would like to once again request that you gentlemen continue to maintain your original intentions, continue to provide guidance, and work together to build a new Shanghai!

Vice Speaker Xi Expresses Pleasure

After the Mayor's address, Vice Speaker Xi Yushu then rose to speak, briefly stating: Over the past two weeks, the councilors have spoken freely and without reservation, giving an excellent performance. I am extremely pleased that the meeting has successfully concluded. The Mayor is humble and sincerely accepts public opinion, which is admirable. In the future, I hope that the municipal government and various bureaus will pay more attention to the opinions of this council. After the speech, amidst the melodious sound of military music, the first meeting of the historically significant Shanghai Provisional Council came to a close.

After the meeting adjourned, Mayor Qian hosted a banquet for all the councilors at the council venue, and invited heads of various agencies to accompany them. After an hour, the guests and hosts dispersed in high spirits.

General Assembly Declaration

The Provisional Council closed yesterday afternoon and issued a declaration, the main points of which are as follows: (1) At this time of national restoration, all regions are gathering to recover from past assistance, and should take the construction of this city as their own responsibility, actively assisting in order to complete the ideal of a New Shanghai based on the Three Principles of the People. (2) The material construction of the city must be implemented step by step by the government, and the development of the urban and suburban areas should be considered concurrently. The original public facilities should be restored to their former appearance, and the pursuit of public health is essential to the health of the citizens. All citizens of our city must do their best to cooperate effectively with the government, so that the construction of a new Shanghai can be expected to succeed, and the citizens can share happiness and prosperity. (3) Labor unrest continues to rise, and society is uneasy. On the one hand, factories should be restored, and on the other hand, labor unrest should be eliminated. The resumption of work must be coordinated with effective measures, and to eliminate labor unrest, the minimum necessary wage for workers' livelihood must be stipulated. The government has its inherent responsibilities, and all citizens of the city should share the difficulties and work hard. (4) The city's education system is declining day by day, and colleagues are heartbroken. Therefore, an urgent appeal is made to the municipal authorities to increase education funding, which should currently account for at least 20% of the city's total budget, focusing on eliminating illiteracy, enriching the facilities of public and private schools, increasing teacher compensation, and subsidizing poor students. (5) After the restoration, the local government has a firm determination to eliminate social ills. Past bad habits have accumulated and are difficult to change, so that promotion has been difficult to achieve. The correction of social atmosphere, the government should strictly enforce the order in a passive way, and in the active aspect, it should be led by the social leadership to set an example for the general public. The public security authorities should rectify their subordinates and devote themselves to supervision. (6) After the city experienced war, public and private lands should be reorganized, and registration procedures should be simplified. Those whose houses and properties were illegally occupied, forcibly occupied, or forcibly purchased by the enemy and puppets should be investigated to ascertain the facts and returned accordingly, or if requisition is necessary due to factual needs, compensation should be given. As for the imbalance in the city's fiscal revenue and expenditure, the financial authorities should seek remedies as soon as possible and establish a fiscal system. The funding required for special construction should be generously subsidized by the central government in order to fulfill the mission. (7) Our country advocates local autonomy, and the people still lack the habit of participating automatically. Therefore, on the one hand, the people's interest in politics should be aroused, and on the other hand, the established autonomous bodies should be allowed to fully exert their functions. The government should respect the status of democratically elected autonomous bodies and not interfere within the scope of national laws, so that a good foundation for democratic politics can be laid. (8) The original equipment of the city's public utilities has been severely damaged after eight years of war, and repairs and restoration cannot be completed in a short period of time. The daily supply of water, electricity, gas, and transportation to the citizens has reached its maximum limit. All citizens must understand this serious situation, strictly abide by the principle of frugality, reduce waste, and maintain the supply of public utilities so as not to cause panic in water and electricity.

### A Group Wearing Military Uniforms, Drunk, Beat a Passerby to Death; Yizhong Tobacco Company Accountant Deng Shuzi Tragically Dies

[This Newspaper] Deng Shuzi, a native of Wuxi, 46 years old, resided at No. 4, Lane 1489, West Beijing Road. He had been an accountant at the Yizhong Tobacco Company for nearly 24 years. Around 7:00 PM the night before, he was invited by a friend to dine at a restaurant on Henan Road. They dispersed around 10:30 PM. At that time, Deng and two friends, Zheng and Yang, were slightly drunk and slowly returned to their residence. While walking through the intersection of Maitehurst Road and Avenue Road, they suddenly encountered twelve people wearing military uniforms, also overly intoxicated and staggering on the street. Somehow, an argument broke out with Deng. The group immediately surrounded Deng and beat him severely. At that time, Deng's friends Zheng and Yang, fearing that they would be implicated, took the opportunity to avoid the situation. When the assailants dispersed, Zheng and Yang returned and saw that Deng had been seriously injured and had collapsed on the ground, unconscious. They quickly hired a car to help Deng back to his residence, and then sent him to various hospitals for emergency treatment. However, it was late at night, and all of them refused to admit him. After a delay until 3:30 AM the next morning, they were finally able to send him to the First Branch of the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road. Due to injuries to the back of his head and internal organs, he could not be saved and died at 11:30 AM. The situation was very tragic. Afterwards, his family reported the incident to the Xincheng Police Sub-bureau, which sent police to investigate and search for the perpetrators. According to Deng Shuxun, the victim's younger brother, who spoke to reporters, his brother was a Bachelor of Arts graduate of the University of Hong Kong, so he had a solid foundation in literature and usually enjoyed writing poetry. He was of upright character and not good at flattery. Although he was over forty, he was still unmarried. This tragic and untimely death is heartbreaking. His body has been moved to the coroner's office and is scheduled for an autopsy this morning. After handling the funeral, a request will be made to the police authorities to arrest and bring the perpetrators to justice in order to comfort his spirit in the afterlife.

The newsreel of the public trial of the traitor Chen Gongbo, filmed by the Central Film Studio, was test screened at the studio's screening room at 4:00 PM yesterday. In addition to more than a hundred people from the cultural sector, dozens of Chinese and foreign staff from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration attended.

The irrefutable evidence of these ten major crimes was shown in the form of Chen Gongbo's appearances in films during his time in the puppet organization: (1) The ugly act of standing at attention and saluting the Japanese; (2) The shameless scene of presenting a traitorous treaty to the Japanese; (3) The despicable act of Wang Jingwei bowing ninety degrees when exchanging documents with the Japanese envoy; (4) The scene of Chen Gongbo giving a speech to the public, declaring war on Britain and the United States. When he spoke the words "declare war", the screen scene temporarily froze, and the reporter introduced to the audience that this was the most shameless scene of Chen's treachery. The final scene was Chen Gongbo arguing in court. The film lasted about twenty minutes, and Chen's treacherous and ugly actions were fully exposed on the screen.

### Communist Party Creates Conspiracies of Unrest; Appeal to the Government to Resolutely Stop Them

The City Provisional Council passed a telegram to Chairman Chiang yesterday, requesting him to take effective measures to resolutely stop the Communist Party's conspiracies. At the same time, it sent a telegram to Yan'an requesting them to consider the overall situation and abide by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference to realize democratic politics. The original telegrams are as follows:

Telegram to the Chairman

Chairman Chiang, Chongqing National Government, Greetings. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the Chinese Communist Party claimed territory by force, destroyed transportation, and prevented various restoration works from being completed quickly, causing price fluctuations and increasing people's hardship. The Central Government has repeatedly tolerated this illegal behavior of the Chinese Communist Party, and in order to restore national order, it invited representatives of various parties, factions, and non-partisan social elites to hold a Political Consultative Conference. The Allied nation of the United States also sent General Marshall to mediate and organize a military team to stop military conflict in order to peacefully resolve political disputes, hoping to realize democratic politics and complete the great cause of national construction. However, the Chinese Communist Party has other ambitions and conspiracies. While the situation in the Northeast is still awaiting diplomatic negotiations, it has sent heavy troops and sneaked into various provinces, attempting to implement territorial division and split the country. If this behavior is not stopped, how can we face the loyal and brave soldiers and the people who have fought hard and sacrificed in the past eight years, and put the country on the road to long-term peace and stability? According to today's newspaper, the Chinese Communist Party's newspaper, Yan'an Liberation Daily, even published an absurd editorial, wantonly slandering Your Excellency, which is a reversal of right and wrong and a loss of the normal rules of a political party. Its intention is nothing more than to create chaos in order to seize power. After eight years of war, our country is impoverished and exhausted, and can no longer withstand internal strife. This council, representing the interests of 3.5 million citizens of Shanghai, unanimously resolved to appeal to the Chinese Communist Party to consider the overall situation, abandon its conspiracies to create chaos, and request Your Excellency to take effective steps to resolutely prevent it, in order to safeguard the foundation of the country. The telegram is urgent and awaits orders. Xu Jiqing, Speaker of the Shanghai Provisional Council, Xi Yushu, Vice Speaker, and all councilors bow in haste.

Telegram to the Communist Party

Mr. Mao Zedong and Mr. Zhu De of Yan'an, and all members of the Chinese Communist Party, Greetings. (Omitted above) This council, representing the interests of 3.5 million citizens of Shanghai, should be resolved by the general assembly to appeal to the Chinese Communist Party to consider the overall situation, abandon its conspiracies to create chaos, and earnestly request that you consider that our country has been devastated by eight years of war, and that the national strength and the people's strength have been depleted, and can no longer withstand internal strife. Firmly change your plans and faithfully abide by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, peacefully build the country, and realize democratic politics. The country will be fortunate, and the people will be fortunate. The telegram is urgent and awaits orders. Xu Jiqing, Speaker of the Shanghai Provisional Council, Xi Yushu, Vice Speaker, and all councilors bow in haste.

During the hearing yesterday, the defendant stated that he had never taken office as the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the puppet Henan Province. As for taking the position of puppet Administrative Inspector Commissioner, he said that he had obtained the consent of Chen Keqiang, then the chief of the Jinghu District of the Military Statistics Bureau, who instructed him to provide information, and that he would be responsible for the matter later. Therefore, he requested the court to summon Chen for investigation. Chen is currently the Director of the Supervisory Office of the Northeast Security Command. Then, the informant Sun Wentong detailed the process. The case is complex, and the court ordered a rescheduling for further hearing. (2) Jiao Baiquan: Former Secretary and Division Chief of the Propaganda Department of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government. During his tenure, he was accused of dereliction of duty for extorting money from theaters such as Tianchan and Huanghou Gong Stage and was detained by the puppet court. After the victory, the High Procuratorate interrogated him and considered that he had violated the regulations on punishing traitors, and filed a public prosecution. During the court hearing yesterday, the defendant argued that he did not extort money, but that the theaters sent it voluntarily, and it was distributed equally after being collected, and even the puppet Director Liang Xiuyu took some. The court ordered a rescheduling for further hearing. (3) Feng Yaofu: A native of Taiwan, accused of serving as a translator for the enemy's military police on Beidang Road, and of going to the home of Wu Zhongying, the captain of the first team of the third district of the second branch of the city's youth group, to attempt to arrest Jiang Bocheng, which resulted in the death of the servant Xu Ma from being beaten. After the victory, he was reported by Wu, and the High Procuratorate filed a public prosecution. The defendant stated in court yesterday that he was forced to join the enemy in Taiwan at that time, and asked the court to investigate the circumstances at that time. As for the death of Xu Ma from being beaten, it was done by the Japanese. Then, Wu Zhongying detailed the process, and the court ordered a rescheduling for further hearing. (4) Kang Luqiao: Former Mayor of Sanlintang Town in the puppet Shanghai County, Wang Fuqi: Former Director of the Joint Office of the Seven Townships of the puppet Sanlin Town, Kang Fu: Former Mayor of Nanxing Township in the puppet Shanghai County.

(5) Luo Zhiqiang: 34 years old, native of Pudong, recently reported by the local youth group, who claimed that he served as an enemy military police informant. However, the defendant firmly denied it in court yesterday, only claiming to be a worker in the Japanese company Maomo Shipyard. The court ordered a continued investigation before further hearing. (6) Li Xibo: 36 years old, native of Shandong, accused of serving as a translator for the enemy in Dalian, and as the Deputy Director of the Administrative Section of the Taishan Sub-bureau of the puppet police station in Shanghai and the Captain of the Special Forces Brigade of the Jiangwan enemy military police. The defendant stated that he was previously a physical education teacher at the Model Middle School in Nanjing.

The prosecutor stated the reasons for the prosecution, and the defendant retained lawyer Wang Shou'an to defend him. The court ordered the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for 2:00 PM on the 17th. (7) Portuguese Nakamura Remidis, Xue Erfa, and Hungarian Xibaoke were accused of purchasing military supplies such as gasoline and diesel for the enemy and arresting and abusing Chinese people.

### Readers' Letters Urge the Racecourse to Actively Convert into a Park

To Commemorate Chairman Chiang's Great Achievements and Share Joy with the People

Editor: I was overjoyed to read in your newspaper on March 27th the news that "the Racecourse will be converted into a park, and the authorities are in contact." The Racecourse was originally a large gambling den, an example of imperialist economic aggression, and also a great disgrace in our country's history. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and the unequal treaties have been abolished, this special area should not be allowed to continue to exist. I previously submitted a letter of suggestion to Chairman Chiang, also requesting that the Racecourse be converted into "Zhongzheng Park," both to commemorate Chairman Chiang's great achievements and to allow citizens to share the joy. At that time, it was an ideal for me, and now it will become a reality. I am secretly pleased. I now request the municipal council and the authorities to use Chairman Chiang's elegant inscription as the park's name when converting it into a park, and to cast a bronze statue so that all people can admire it. Although it cannot be like the Guangdong compatriots casting a golden statue, it will not be inferior to them. Please proceed quickly and complete the conversion before Chairman Chiang's sixtieth birthday to celebrate longevity without bounds, which is of profound significance. This is my humble opinion, whether it is appropriate or not, please let people from all walks of life see it for themselves. From reader Yao Datian

### Bulls Advance and Retreat Freely, Bond Market Rises and Falls Quickly, Chinese Stocks Flat, Foreign Stocks Rebound Slightly

Bond buyers made persistent efforts, and Class C bonds opened at a new high of 5,000 yuan this morning. As the bulls reaped profits, they rushed to sell, and the price immediately fell back by 500 yuan to 4,500 yuan. The so-called major players in the bond market, the old bulls, refused to let go and continued to absorb them, taking advantage of the loose monetary conditions. Their chips were almost exhausted, and they were pulled up again. When the 5,000 yuan mark was broken through again, the retail short sellers were squeezed again, and the ball was kicked up again, creating a new peak of 5,200 yuan. The major players then released their chips, but then there was a lack of support, and they fell back to 4,600 yuan again. The fluctuations were extremely erratic, and people were confused. The footing was extremely unstable. There were very few opponents. The powerful factions tended to collect miscellaneous brands, and Class C bonds were also brought up. As a result, the closing prices of Class A, B, and C bonds were slightly higher than before. Class D bonds were the coldest, falling by 150 yuan alone, still oversupplied. Class E bonds also rose by a small amount. Chinese stocks experienced many twists and turns, rising and falling repeatedly. The bullish companies were in a difficult situation, riding a tiger and unable to get off, and had no choice but to continue to pull and absorb. However, it was rumored that the new organization only raised 100 million yuan, which could only absorb 200,000 shares of Yongsha. Generally speaking, people felt that their strength was insufficient and did not place too high expectations on the future of the stock price. Profiteers occasionally emerged, causing many flaws. There were many twists and turns in the morning, barely managing to maintain it. As a result, the three popular stocks, Yongsha, Meiya, and Jingfu, rose slightly. The unpopular stocks were flat. Various companies held shareholders' meetings one after another, and small stocks were more stable. In the afternoon, the asking prices were still weak. Foreign stocks were uncertain yesterday because the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to inspect them, and many closed out. Except for Yeguangxiangtai, the other stocks were overwhelmed by the supply side. As a result, except for Yeguangxiangtai, which fell very slightly, the other stocks fell back by half a percent to one percent.

### Gold Market Calm, Foreign Currencies Rise and Fall Very Slightly

Red Gold opened flat yesterday morning. After opening, there were still floating bulls closing out, and it fell back slightly. The monetary conditions were loose, and buyers absorbed at lower prices. The process rose slightly in peace. The major players have abandoned it and gone elsewhere, and the gold market is doubly deserted. The price hovered around the previous closing price throughout the morning. It was slightly stable at noon, but fell back slightly in the afternoon. As a result, it fell back by 15,000 yuan compared to the previous closing price. Gold jewelry in silver shops was listed at 160,000 yuan. Fine silver was still 1,500 yuan. Silver dollars were slightly stable, with buyers at 1,030 yuan. The shadow discount was even looser with monetary conditions, and the interest rate ranged from 12 to 17 cents.

The buying sentiment for US dollars in foreign currencies was still difficult to sustain, but the situation was still stable. In the morning, the low price was 1,880 yuan, and the high price was 1,905 yuan. The rise and fall were narrow, initially stable and then weak. As a result, it fell by 15 yuan compared to the previous closing price. Hong Kong dollars continued to be absorbed by powerful factions yesterday, and the situation was slightly stable. As a result, the old price was flat, and the new price rose by 2 yuan. The US exchange rate has not changed. The bank's exchange rate is still between 1,930 yuan and 1,950 yuan. Hong Kong telegraph was 395 yuan, and the rupee was 495 yuan.

### Yarn Market Downturn Gradually Stabilizes, Spot Cotton Transactions Slightly Improve

The downturn in the yarn market stopped yesterday. Although large merchants from Fujian, Guangdong, and the Yangtze River region lacked sales, the crazy drop seemed to have aroused the sales of the Beijing-Shanghai line. Although the transaction volume was not large throughout the day, the price was still firm. Small yarn and 16-count yarn recovered by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. The increase in large-brand goods was limited, and fine yarn and Shuangqian were still not improving. The reason was that the Textile and Construction Company's auction was held yesterday afternoon as scheduled. 40-count single yarn and 42-count double-stranded yarn fell by 90,000 yuan at most. The remaining counts only fell by 20,000 to 50,000 yuan, and the decline was much slower than in previous times. In addition, 28 kinds of wool fabrics and 2 kinds of blankets were sold. As usual, cloth will be sold today.

Yesterday, the New York American cotton rose by 16 to 25 pounds, with the near-term American dollar at 28.08, the long-term at 28.27, and the Middling spot at 28.63. The local spot cotton market was still weak, but the transaction volume improved slightly. The Green Textile and Construction Company also absorbed Middling and Brazilian cotton, with a transaction volume of 20 bales. In addition, there was no news of private yarn mills purchasing.

### Wool Fabrics Summer Sales Gradually Rise, New Arrivals of Plain Velvet

The summer sales of wool fabrics have continued to rise recently. Although wholesale sales are still limited, the transaction volume in door shops is quite large. At the same time, small batch wholesale business is also good.

The new blue, gray, dark blue, and plain velvet on the market have a width of only 54 inches. The selling price is 52,500 yuan per yard, which is very suitable for sale as women's cheongsam fabric. This is the first batch shipped by the American wheel, and it is said to be produced in Australia. The cost is only 27,000 to 8,000 yuan per yard, so people in the industry are rushing to order.

### Rice Prices Rise Slightly, Soybean Oil Continues to Fall Slightly

Yesterday, the rice market tended to be firm due to cloudy weather. Both japonica and indica rice rose slightly by 300 to 500 yuan. The supply of cloudy yuan rice was scarce, and the price rose by 1,000 yuan. White yuan rice was still mediocre. The closing prices of various goods also softened. Wenzhou and Qingdao inquiries for flour were slightly increased, and the price tightened by 100 yuan. Bran was digested in the mainland and also rose by 100 yuan. Soybean cake rose first and then fell back, but it was still difficult to prosper. Soybeans were tight in the morning and slack in the afternoon. The actual consumption was sluggish. The supply of raw peanuts was abundant, and the digestion was sluggish, falling by 1,000 yuan. Sesame transaction volume was sparse, falling by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Mung beans were flat, and corn digestion was sluggish. The oil market was weak and difficult to stand due to the continuous arrival of goods. Crude oil fell by nearly 1,000 yuan, and soybean oil continued to fall by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The future situation of each grain still depends on the downstream.

### 10,000 Tons of American Wheat Arrive in Shanghai One After Another

The William J. O'Toni, managed by Fulai Company, arrived from the United States with more than 6,000 tons of wheat and berthed at floating pier 32.33 for unloading. The Pi-Pi-Ai Alanck, managed by Jardine Matheson, transported 4,000 tons of wheat from Vancouver. Due to the lack of vacant docks and floating piers in the port, it is temporarily anchored outside the port, and will be imported as soon as the number of ships in the port decreases.

### Sugar Prices Not Easy to Turn Around

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was still weak. The association's plate price for medium sugar white opened at 46,000 yuan, and then was 45,500 yuan, down another 500 yuan. The retail price of Shi-Lu Qing sugar was 48,000 yuan. The price of Shi-Lu white sugar was 50,000 yuan, followed by 48,000 yuan. Ordinary rock sugar was 90,000 yuan. In view of the recent light customer sales and poor digestion, it is not easy to turn around temporarily.

### Market Rumors of Fluctuations in the US Exchange Rate, Authorities Solemnly Deny

In recent days, there have been rumors in the market that there will be fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate. According to the person in charge of the Central Bank, the exchange rate of the Central Bank's US telegraphic transfer is always 2,020 yuan for spot, 2,120 yuan for May, 2,220 yuan for June, and 2,320 yuan for July, and has never changed. This is purely speculative merchants creating rumors in an attempt to profit.

In addition: The foreign exchange market has also gradually decreased due to the continuous drop in gold prices in recent days. This morning, the buying price of US exchange at Chase Bank was as follows: telegraphic transfer was 1,870 yuan, check was 1,860 yuan, and US bill was 1,840 yuan. The exchange rate for British currency has not been officially announced by the authorities. The current settlement method is to calculate based on the market price of the day, plus the exchange fee.

In addition, according to the financial sector, our country's foreign exchange fund is extremely abundant. In addition to the 500 million US dollars that the government has allocated when opening foreign exchange, the authorities have recently negotiated with the United States for a large loan, which is quite large and the progress will soon mature. This loan will be used to stabilize our country's monetary system, so the financial future is very optimistic.

Liangshan Elementary School has appointed Sa Benxi as the director of preparation. U Mengxi Gong Banner Elementary School will be established in Suiyuan, and Cun Zhenhua will be appointed as the principal. They have all gone to prepare. Teaching equipment in frontier schools is always lacking due to difficulties in purchasing and transportation. Recently, the Ministry of Education decided to purchase twenty-one sets of middle school libraries and twenty-five sets of high school and junior high school physics and chemistry instruments and distribute them to various frontier schools, and entrusted the Public Welfare Rescue Team to transport them to the education halls of the southwestern and northwestern provinces for storage. At the same time, medical and social education equipment is especially needed in the frontier. In the 34th year, the Ministry of Education distributed 36 boxes of medicines, 12 sets of medical equipment, 16 radios, and 18 slide projectors to various frontier schools for use. (An)

### Huang Shao's Farewell Speech Examines Zhejiang Province Education

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou News] Zhejiang Province Chairman Huang Shaohong will be transferred to the National Government Committee and will soon leave Zhejiang. The provincial capital held a farewell meeting for him. Here is an excerpt from Chairman Huang's speech at the meeting, regarding the need to devote efforts to the basic work of education in the expectation of the ideal new Zhejiang, saying: The ideal new Zhejiang should establish democratization and industrialization, but how can we achieve democratization and industrialization? It cannot be achieved by empty words, and we must devote efforts to the basic work of education. Two years ago, a slogan of Education Year was proposed for the construction of Zhejiang Province, because without popular education and undeveloped science, the goal of industrialization and democratization cannot be achieved. In the future, if we want to truly achieve the goal of democratization and industrialization, we must earnestly promote education. After the victory, the head of state has put forward the slogan of "Education First in the Nation-Building Period." Therefore, reviewing Zhejiang's education, although there has been some progress in recent years, it is still a superficial and quantitative achievement. If we really want to achieve the goal of popular education and developed science, we still need to strive for the enrichment of education facilities and content. Today, at the time of departure, I sincerely hope that the local elders, education authorities, and young students of Zhejiang Province will make fundamental efforts in education to complete the greatest and most glorious mission of the country, the nation, and the local area of Zhejiang.

### Mayor's Cup, Longjie Eliminated, Qingbai Seizes Re-match Rights, Result: 3-2 Comeback Victory, Longjie Takes Lead with One Goal in the First Half

Yesterday, a semi-re-match of the Mayor's Cup Football Tournament took place at Jiaozhou Park at 4:00 PM. Qingbai faced Longjie. Unexpectedly, the young players of Longjie displayed rapid improvement in their skills. In the first half, Wang Buyun's shot gave them a 1-0 lead. In the second half, they briefly led again at 2-1. Unfortunately, Qingbai's Li Yichen seized two opportunities at the end, both scoring, resulting in Longjie's defeat, which was regrettable. The final result was 3-2. Qingbai's Li Yichen and Lin Xi were present, and the rest also took the field. After the start of the game, Longjie played skillfully, putting Qingbai in a passive position. At 35 minutes, Longjie's left-winger Wang Buyun took a sharp shot from the side, scoring successfully. The first half ended with Longjie winning 1-0.

In the second half, Qingbai made many adjustments, while Longjie only substituted Qiu Sanbao for Li Guangshun. Qingbai launched a counterattack. At 6 minutes, Meng Yiliang took a long shot from beyond 20 yards, hitting the net directly. The score was tied at 1-1. Unexpectedly, at 15 minutes, Lin Shaojun succeeded again, and Longjie took the lead again, 2-1. At this point, Qingbai became anxious and rushed forward. At 22 minutes, Longjie, focusing solely on attack, left their defense vulnerable. Li Yichen took advantage of this, scoring two goals within five minutes. Qingbai came from behind, winning 3-2 until the end of the game.

### Guangdong Provincial Senators Question Relief Agency, Settling a Relief Account

— Guangzhou Airmail, April 1, Sent by Our Correspondent Liang Feng

Ever since senators raised the question at the three sessions of the Political Council, "The Guangdong branch of the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration sits idly by while Guangzhou disaster victims are left unaided. Dozens of people die of starvation in Guangzhou every day, yet their flour has never benefited ordinary people. How should this be improved?" it has attracted great attention here. Because this is a matter of vital concern to Guangdong, how can all parties ignore it? Therefore, the Guangdong Provincial Provisional Council, the body representing public opinion here, scheduled a policy report by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration branch at the afternoon session of the fourth day of the second session, which began on March 25.

How Many Impoverished People Benefit?

The event was undoubtedly captivating, as the general public believed that the agency had been poorly managed with many malpractices since its establishment and distribution of relief supplies. How many impoverished people have actually benefited? Recently, several boxes of the agency's milk were stolen, and 25 million yuan were fraudulently claimed. The sale of canned beef, milk, milk powder, and other relief supplies was entrusted to the Central Trust Bureau. All items were priced per unit, and each unit cost more than 10,000 yuan to purchase. Is this in line with the principles of relief? Therefore, the public voiced their dissatisfaction, and many newspapers published reports criticizing the agency. As a result, everyone's attention was focused there, to see how this relief organization would settle this relief account!

On the afternoon of the 28th, the meeting hall resembled a classroom. The entrance was decorated with colored streamers. Facing the entrance was a platform elevated about a foot above the ground, serving as the chairman's stand. Facing the platform were tables arranged in seven rows vertically and horizontally. Many chairs were placed diagonally on both sides, serving as seating for reporters and guests. The arrangement of the meeting hall was exceptionally simple. Apart from the colorful paper strips released from the central skylight and the several pots of fresh flowers on the chairman's stand, which complemented the newly painted soft, milky yellow walls, only a few banners provided some decoration. The most captivating scene unfolded here.

Relief Agency Turns a Blind Eye to Death

At exactly 3:00 PM, it was the turn of Ling, the director of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration branch, to present the report. Carrying a stack of reports, he arrived in a grand procession with twenty-eight advisors, experts, and staff members, along with Mr. Adams, a foreign friend from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, filling the seats for reporters and guests. Director Ling, accompanied by a secretary, walked onto the chairman's stand. In a designated spot next to the chairman, he hung an enlarged statistical chart, fearing that the senators might not be able to clearly see the written report. After a brief introduction by Chairman Lin Yizhong of the council, Director Ling began his report. Director Ling knew that the public was not very satisfied with him, so he launched a preemptive strike. Speaking in Mandarin with a Hakka accent, he first explained the structure of the agency, stating that the purchase and sale of various relief supplies were handled by a purchasing and sales office established by the Finance Department of the headquarters and were unrelated to the branch office, especially to "himself." Furthermore, everyone believed that the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration had received a large amount of supplies and criticized them for turning a blind eye to death. However, how many supplies had the United Nations shipped to China? The total value was 100 million US dollars, amounting to more than 4 million tons, but only a small portion was allocated to Guangdong. In the past four months, the actual relief flour received was only 3,500 tons. If distributed to the 35 million people in the province, each person would only receive one pound. Moreover, some of it was distributed directly as relief, while some was used for work relief. The first batch of rice, though 9,000 bags had arrived, was American rice, divided into eight types. According to the United Nations regulations, one-third was to be distributed directly as relief, while two-thirds were to be sold at a subsidized price to stabilize prices. However, this was handled by the purchasing and sales office. Now the price of rice has risen to over 40,000 yuan per dan (a traditional unit of weight). Why is it not being distributed for relief? This is the intention of the foreigners, because these experts have long ears and have heard that the Four Banks are purchasing white rice to hand over to Japanese prisoners of war to take to Tokyo, so they firmly refuse to distribute it, waiting until the Japanese prisoners of war have left.

Seven Boxes of Milk Stolen from Warehouse

As for the reports of over twenty boxes of milk being stolen from the warehouse, only seven boxes of milk were actually lost. Valued at over 200,000 yuan at market prices, and the total value of all canned goods was 400 million yuan, the theft of 200,000 yuan was a small amount, accounting for only one percent of the total. Moreover, the principle has been established that if the thief cannot be found, all warehouse employees will be required to compensate for the loss at the original price. After Ling explained, he proceeded with a report based on the written document, which took over an hour. It was not until the chairman intervened that he requested a few more minutes of indulgence. During the report, he acted like a teacher, holding a ruler in his right hand and a notebook in his left, running to the front of the stage and explaining the charts. After the senators patiently listened to his words, they could no longer endure it and launched a fierce barrage of questions like bombs. First, one senator questioned Director Ling: "Before the establishment of the purchasing and sales office, was the manager in charge of selling flour also held by you, Director Ling? Did the Huang Zhisheng case, where a merchant reselling subsidized bread committed fraud, occur during your tenure, Director Ling?"

Huge Sum of Public Funds Fraudulently Claimed

He also said: "I heard that 25 million yuan of public funds from your agency were fraudulently claimed. Is that true?" Then, one senator after another stood up and asked questions like machine guns, expressing their emotions and barely suppressing their overly aggressive questioning, passionate applause, and indignant emotions, which filled the meeting hall for three and a half hours.

Everyone focused on: (1) Relief items not reaching the impoverished and falling into the hands of non-impoverished individuals. (2) The inappropriate policy of entrusting merchants to resell subsidized flour and bread. (3) Poor management of the agency, with numerous malpractices, and those who should not have benefited were enriching themselves. (4) What is the truth about the stolen milk and the 25 million yuan being fraudulently claimed? This shows the lack of strict management. (5) Numerous errors in the figures in the written report, indicating negligence in handling affairs. (6) The evidence in the Huang Zhisheng fraud case is solid, so why has it not been strictly handled for so long? (7) The winter relief funds report shows that they were distributed in January, but many counties have still not received them. (8) What standards are used for the distribution of relief supplies to various counties? A total of more than seventy questions were raised. Director Ling stood up and answered each one, invariably stating that the entrusting of merchants for resale was by order of the headquarters and requesting evidence of corrupt acts, promising to strictly handle them. He said that only seven boxes of milk were stolen, and the 25 million yuan were fraudulently claimed on February 21 and discovered on March 2, but this responsibility lies with the Central Bank because the three seals on the check were all forged. He said that he would be responsible for the errors in the figures in the written report...

Do Not Be Vague, Do Not Shirk Responsibility

However, these answers did not satisfy the senators. Especially when senators raised the issue of numerous improprieties in the distribution of flour, Director Ling replied that if there was evidence, he would certainly handle it strictly. This angered one senator, who said loudly and forcefully: "Public opinion must have a basis. It is not necessary to produce evidence. If you insist on having all the evidence before strictly handling it, then the dark secrets of society will never be improved. I hope that Director Ling's answers will not be vague or shirk responsibility."

The time had exceeded two hours, and the electric lights were all on. The senators, concerned that disaster victims were in dire need of aid and that the relief agency was poorly managed, causing disputes, unwittingly allowed the time to extend. Finally, one senator said earnestly: "Director Ling, please understand that the questions raised today are all in good faith. In the future, what we hope is: (1) Because of the difficulty of transportation, rice cannot be transported here, but can you find a solution? (2) Please make the distribution of relief supplies public in the future." He concluded the questioning with these two hopes.

### The Gunfire That Destroyed Peace Shattered the Dreams of the People of Nantong

— Nantong Correspondence, March 28, Sent by Yao Wei

After the news that the Executive Headquarters would arrive in Nantong spread, the small ancient city and its 200,000 residents felt as if their heartstrings were pulled tight, waiting for the Executive Headquarters, the savior holding the power to grant them peace and a secure life. From early morning on March 18, everyone began to wait, until 6:00 PM when they truly knew that the savior had arrived. Although it was raining and a sharp, cold wind was blowing, teams of students and crowds like tides expressed their welcoming enthusiasm with the utmost excitement and action.

Mr. Cooke appeared amidst the cheers of the crowd. On the makeshift platform, he responded to the people's hopes, saying: "We will begin to discuss and resolve your problems."

People were comforted and grateful to the Executive Headquarters. They shouted: "Long live the Executive Headquarters!" The crowd, like a tide, surged, pushed forward, and left with cheers and imagined smiles.

Buried in Indoor Work

The Executive Headquarters carries the hopes of 290,000 people in Nantong. How are they living? Naturally, the first two days were inevitably filled with banquets, from feasts to evening parties. These were small favors that the people were willing to do for the Executive Headquarters, hoping that the Executive Headquarters could discuss and make decisions for lasting peace in a peaceful atmosphere. At several banquets, Mr. Cooke said: "Many issues between the Communists and Nationalists are ridiculous. For example, when both sides are arguing, they even calculate the bricks and tiles of the blockhouse. But these are all small and ridiculous things." Because most of the days in Nantong were rainy, they could not help but bury themselves in their rooms. Our ally, Mr. Cooke, and his aide, Mr. Brandt, were relatively lonely. Because of the language barrier, the number of visitors naturally decreased. However, Mr. Cooke was not tired of this life, because he said that his working hours in Beiping had exceeded twenty hours a day, and now it was relatively leisurely. Even on sunny days, he preferred to be indoors. Brandt's life was only lively when he was with the interpreter. Colonel Hsiao spent every day reading some Shanghai newspapers. As the leader of the group, he did not go out much. During the talks, there was no sign of anything on his words and actions. He was very quiet, spoke with a Beijing accent, and often loved to wear a pair of cloth-soled soft shoes. Although he was a fat man, he walked without a sound. The representatives and aides on the government side were able to quickly grasp the time and complete their work. The rest of the time was spent in their activities. Sometimes they also looked for some indoor sports, such as playing table tennis and badminton, which also served as indoor games. The Communist leader, Mr. Han, did not laugh much. Perhaps, except when he and the other Communist representatives talked about some exciting things in the past, we could not easily see his smile! The Communist representatives and aides were mostly together, playing cards, talking about the past and the future. Most of the time, they read newspapers and books, and then sang songs. They also had two special correspondents from the Xinhua News Agency's Central China branch, one of whom was a woman, but she was also quiet in her activities. At the same time, they were responsible for reporting, so they had to take time to write articles.

Everyone Felt Mysterious

These many staff members were distributed in various rooms every day, each doing their own thing. The only time they gathered together was during mealtime. At first, breakfast had to be eaten collectively, but later it was democratized. Whoever wanted to eat what, they would call separately to their rooms. The two meals in the evening were alternately Chinese and Western, to suit the tastes of Chinese and foreigners.

In their way of life, they were very harmonious and unrestricted. The joyous laughter from storytelling often vibrated between them. They would also casually talk about democracy and liberation, but without arguing about anything. The Executive Headquarters was working in this way, and everyone felt it was too mysterious. Yes, even the reporters who lived with them could not know how long this mystery would continue!

Gunfire in Baipu Town

Just as the hope of peace filled the hearts of more than 200,000 compatriots in Nantong City, and peace negotiations were unfolding in the Executive Headquarters, the sound of gunfire that destroyed peace came again in Baipu Town, a contested area between the Communists and Nationalists 60 miles from Nantong County.

On the stormy and dark night of the 25th, a bloody battle broke out. Naturally, it was a small-scale battle. More than 100 Communists attacked. As a result of the battle, the Communists suffered more than a dozen casualties, and the Nationalist army suffered one casualty. But the sound of gunfire that destroyed peace awakened the slumber of the peace-loving people in the darkness. Was it peace? They were waiting for the mediation of the Executive Headquarters!

On the 28th, a sunny spring day after a long period of rain, Mr. Cooke and the leader of the government representatives, Mr. Hsiao, and many others, carrying bread, fruit, towels, toothpaste, and other necessities, went to the Jiangbei Hospital to comfort the soldiers injured in this civil war. What they brought back was endless sighing! "War is cruel!" "Peace is coming, right?" The reporter prays silently on behalf of the people of Nantong and northern Jiangsu! (Nantong, March 28)

Nationalist Army Defends Shenyang City

Defensive fortifications piled up at intersections in Shenyang City. Soldiers of the Youth Army's 207th Division stand guard with guns. Since the Nationalist army took over Shenyang City, the security situation has been improving, and the people are feeling more secure. The number of shops reopening is increasing.

### Save the Children Who Have Lost Their Mother's Love

— Zhu Jiaqing

Every child in the world has a mother, and every mother loves her own child. But not every child is blessed with the grace of a mother's love. So we say, "Only children who receive a mother's love are happy!"

A mother's love is not only an important element in the structure of a family, but also a precious thing in the course of an individual's life. Of course, it will also contribute a solid foundation to human and world peace, because human sympathy and mutual love are the sublimation of human motherly love.

The impact of a mother's love on an individual's life is, in reality, a kind of educational force. Because the essence of education is the change of behavior and the transformation of experience, which my teacher Mr. Dong Renjian calls "transformation." Mothers instinctively protect their children, and they are the closest people to everyone—virtually the first teacher in life. Therefore, their ability to "transform" is the strongest, their impact on the development of an individual's personality is the greatest, and their relationship with education is the closest.

Since the relationship between a mother and education is so close, and since emotion and education are considered inseparable in modern educational thought, according to the research of general psychoanalysts, the emotions and attitudes of a mother are sufficient to influence the pattern of a child's entire personality development. In other words, a person who receives a mother's love will have a pleasant, confident, and active personality, while a person who does not receive a mother's love will have a depressed, timid, and passive personality. Their life will be unhealthy, their behavior will be abnormal, and they will not be able to live happily with others. Because they have not received the response of a mother's love, they simply do not understand what love is, let alone love their family, society, country, world, and humanity with their love!

We know that in this world, there are many children who are very happy because they have received great motherly love. But there are also many children who are trapped in the abyss of sorrow because they have lost their own mother, lost this great motherly love. For this group of unfortunate children, from the standpoint of family happiness, social cooperation, national prosperity, and world peace and human progress, we ask everyone—especially the fathers who have married a second wife—to save this group of children who have lost their mother's love!

### Adopted Daughter's Song

— Ba Ling

'Magpie, magpie, chattering, don't adopt this child; raise her up to be a money-losing burden, selling fields and land to compensate her; she wants a coat made of Nanjing satin, a skirt of Beijing gauze, a complete dowry prepared, shoes with embroidered flowers all over.'

This is a folk song about raising daughters in old-fashioned families. In this song, one can see how traditional Chinese families in the past held a "valuing boys over girls" concept!

In today's era of gender equality, it is necessary to eradicate this unreasonable concept of valuing boys over girls.

However, under the current social conditions, I believe that there are still many old-fashioned families that hold this unreasonable view, which seems to be a problem worthy of discussion for those who study women's family issues.

### Reason for Divorce

An old man named Aceco Blanc, aged fifty, in San Francisco recently filed for divorce from his wife. His reason was that his wife takes twenty-seven cats to bed with her.

### The Psychological Obstacles to Women Engaging in Social Work (Part 2)

— Xiao Cai

Since ancient times, China has held the concept of valuing men over women. As recorded in the Book of Songs: "When a son is born, he is laid on a bed, dressed in fine clothes, and given a scepter to play with. His cries are loud, his future bright, and he will be the lord of his family. When a daughter is born, she is laid on the ground, wrapped in swaddling clothes, and given a spindle to play with. Her concern is to be proper, and her only thought is of food and drink, lest she cause sorrow to her parents." From this, it is clear that boys and girls were treated differently from infancy. This concept has persisted from ancient times until now for thousands of years. With the exception of a few intellectuals who have been influenced by new ideas and have slightly changed, this strong patriarchal atmosphere remains deeply ingrained in all levels of Chinese society. The cultural system that evolved from this concept is the imposition of fallacious views such as the "Three Obediences and Four Virtues" and "A woman without talent is virtuous" on women. This traditional concept not only inflicts mental pain and oppression on women, but also creates a feeling of inferiority in their minds, making them believe that they are truly inferior and incapable of being equal to men. The influence of this toxic legacy of the old moral code for thousands of years has created a sense of inferiority in women's minds, so they dare not, and even think they cannot, compete with men in society. This feeling of inferiority is one of the psychological reasons that hinder women from engaging in social work.

Chinese women have long been subjected to the oppression and restraint of male power. The scope of their daily lives is confined to the extremely narrow confines of the family. It is said, "A woman does not leave the house for ten years," and "Deep palaces and closed doors, guarded by eunuchs; men do not enter, women do not go out." Under these circumstances, women have very few opportunities to be close to the opposite sex, and it is evident that their opportunities to contact the outside world are even fewer. The custom of foot-binding and piercing ears is a sign of preventing women from contacting the outside world. Since women's daily lives are limited to the family, they naturally lack interest in social life. Although modern women may not be subject to this restriction, it is still a common phenomenon that family education in China is stricter for girls than for boys. Generally, parents still prohibit girls from freely participating in various social activities like boys. This kind of family education is enough to cultivate the habit of women's activities being confined to the family. They lack a broad interest in social activities, and as a result, their views are narrow, their vision is limited, and they only see the small world of personal activity. The influence of this historical family education, which cultivates narrow interests and views, is enough to hinder women from having a broad interest in social activities, resulting in the psychological reason that prevents them from engaging in social work.

Usually, women are not responsible for anything other than bearing children and managing household affairs, aside from family and society. This has not only formed a traditional social custom, but has also cultivated a view and attitude of reliance on men in women. They believe that it is right to entrust the economic responsibility of themselves and their families entirely to men. Even when women have productive duties in the family, they are in the position of helping men, which is subordinate rather than primary, thus cultivating a sense of reliance in women. After a considerable period of time, this psychology becomes a habit. They feel comfortable living a dependent life without realizing it. They live an irresponsible life without effort, and as a result, due to inertia, they are unwilling to have any more attempts to break new ground and overcome difficulties, and they lack this kind of courage. Human mental activity always takes the shortest path, as psychologists tell us. Therefore, they develop an attitude and habit of seeking ease and avoiding difficulty, and do not struggle in society. This is the third psychological reason why women cannot engage in social work due to laziness and dependence.

Other psychological reasons that hinder women from engaging in social work include motherhood being more important than career ambition, lack of lofty ideals, vanity, and indulgence in current material enjoyment. Psychologists classify female psychology into the "motherly type," which means that motherhood is particularly developed and all mental activities are focused on raising children. These women naturally tend to be housewives—they are very interested in housework, and they are indifferent and ignore social causes. As for women who lack lofty ideals and indulge in material enjoyment, they only pay attention to the current reality of life, and they cannot see or think about things that are further away from the present reality. Of course, relatively impractical social undertakings cannot arouse their interest.

Women who want true liberation and true gender equality can only participate in broad social work, take social work as a lifelong career, and strive to be an Edison, a Newton, or a Shakespeare. Only in this way can they be liberated from the power of a male-centered society.

### Educating Children

— Liang Gong

"Children who know the difficulty of farming and the taste of poetry and books, and who are mindful of their reputation, can be called virtuous children." — Gao Zhongxian

"It is best to be content with poverty, study, observe propriety, and cultivate oneself. The word 'humility' is endlessly useful in life; the words 'diligence and thrift' will benefit descendants endlessly." — Zhu Fangbo

"Keeping away from wickedness is one meaning of teaching children in wealthy families; keeping away from shame is the essential meaning of teaching children in poor families." — Wen Jiexiao

"Those who are good at teaching children regard being morally upright themselves as the first priority." — Yan Guangzhong

### Model Women

— Chong Jia

'...An educated modern woman should best produce two or three little citizens for the country within three or four years after marrying at the age of twenty-four or five. When the children are all in school, she should serve in society outside the family. At that time, she is only in her thirties, with the physique and perseverance of a young person. Clever women can even take the time to do socially beneficial work while nursing babies… All women who only know how to hide at home after getting married are abandoning themselves. In the trend of the times and the torrent of evolution, they are the dregs to be eliminated…'

——Translated from the original work by Mrs. Russell of England

### Little Black Dress

— Xiao Shufang

Spring is coming, and little girls sometimes like to change things up. They don't always want to wear overalls, and they want to wear little skirts. Because when dancing and playing games at school, they are more stylish and more convenient than overalls, especially when wearing a short suit. A dark-colored skirt, change the tops frequently, and it looks like you are wearing new clothes all the time. The method is very simple. You can use an adult's skirt or cheongsam to modify it. The dimensions in the figure are suitable for a five- or six-year-old girl.

Materials: Any dark, plain, or checkered woolen fabric will do. If it is plain, you can embroider a few flowers on it. The straps and bust can be lined with eye-catching satin material.

Method: Cut according to the dimensions in the figure. Sew the skirt first, with two pleats in the front and back, with a good distance between them. Install the bust, leaving an opening of about five inches on the left side for easy dressing and undressing. Then install the straps. The back can be sewn together and installed on the back. Have the child try it on for size when placing them. The length of the skirt straps can be adjusted appropriately. The satin lining inside the bust and straps can be slightly exposed at the edges (like piping), which can further enhance the beauty of the skirt.
