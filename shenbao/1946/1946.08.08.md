### Fierce Battle in Suburbs, Power Cut Off: Datong's Situation Extremely Critical; Zhengtai Railway Entirely Under Intense Attack

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The fierce offensive launched by the Communist army in Shanxi has now placed Datong in a critical situation. The Communist army has deployed over 300,000 troops, commanded by He Long and Xiao Ke. On the 4th, they captured Kouquan Town Coal Mine, 20 kilometers west of Datong, and continued to fiercely attack the Mingfuquan Airfield, 5 kilometers east of Datong, which they captured. The Pingwang power plant was also occupied, cutting off the power supply to Datong city. The Communist army is determined to capture Datong at all costs, hence Datong is now in extreme danger.

[Our Beiping Office, 7th] Amid the urgent calls from Datong, today a reporter specially visited General Ma Zhanshan at his private residence in Beiping. According to him, he received a telegram yesterday afternoon stating that after Kouquan, southwest of Datong, was occupied, the Pingwang power plant was also captured by the Communist army. Datong's power supply has now been cut off, and the city is plunged into darkness at night. Fierce fighting is currently underway at Gushan, north of the city. More than ten strongholds east of the city, including Caifulou, Zhujiazhuang, Haidong Village, and Shaling, are all engaged in fierce fighting. The airfield east of Datong is now under threat, making it difficult for aircraft to land, thus military supplies are becoming difficult. The defending troops have some food and fuel reserves, which can last for a while, but the food and fuel for hundreds of thousands of people are a significant problem. The besieging Communist army is reportedly about thirty regiments, while the defending troops are the 2nd Division of the Northeast Advancement Army and some local teams, whose strength is quite weak.

[Our Beiping Office, 7th] To coordinate with the offensive in northern Shanxi, the Communist army has launched a full-scale attack on the Zhengtai Railway, the only link between Shanxi and Beiping-Tianjin. The railway has been out of service since the day before yesterday. Trains west of Shijiazhuang only reach Weishui. The Communist army's attack began on the night of the 3rd, attacking Shanghu, Baiyangshu, Yangquan, Duanting, Lujiazhuang, Mashou, Luanliu, Xiapanishi, Dongzhao, and other stations, all of which were fiercely attacked. Among them, Baiyang Station has already fallen, and some bridges have been destroyed.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 7th] Military news: The battles around Datong are still raging. More than ten strongholds east of the city, including Haili Village, Zhujiazhuang, Caifulou, and Shaling, are still in fierce fighting. Shuibo Temple, near the airfield, was captured by the Communist army a few days ago. Currently, the most pressing attempt of the Communist army seems to be to destroy and occupy the Datong airfield. Furthermore, Huai'ren County and Xinquan in Shanxi have been captured by the 6th Regiment of the Communist army.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 7th] The Communist army shifted its offensive to Kouquan Town, southwest of Datong. After a brave counterattack by the National army, they were repelled. On the 5th, the Communist army reinforced heavily and attacked fiercely again. After a day of fierce fighting, the National army slightly shifted to the northeast due to the disparity in numbers, and the town was captured by the Communist army. The situation in Datong is extremely tense.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 6th] Regarding the Communist army's attacks on the National army and the occupation of stations on the Zhengtai Railway in recent days, the local authorities officially raised the issue at 10:30 AM on the 6th during a regular meeting of the three-party representatives of the Taiyuan Executive Headquarters. It is reported that the Executive Headquarters has handed the matter over to the representatives of the commanders of both sides for direct discussion. However, the representatives of the commanders of both sides did not convene a meeting again today. Furthermore, according to reporters, the Executive Headquarters has scheduled a joint meeting of the representatives of both sides at 10:30 AM on the 8th, at which time they will hear the progress of the direct discussions between the two sides in recent days.

### Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu Resorts to Desperate Measures; Incomplete Armed Showdown; National Army Will Never Counterattack Unless Attacked; Chief of General Staff Chen Explains the Truth to Reporters

[Central News Agency, Guling, 7th] "Peace talks have been ineffective, concluding with the Communist Party failing to keep its promises. Today, the Communist Party's rhetoric of comprehensive ceasefire, local ceasefire, and reorganization of the government—if the Communist Party guarantees not to break its promises again, I can still represent the government and sign an agreement with them." This was declared by Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng at his first press conference in Guling at 5:30 PM on the 7th. Chief of General Staff Chen gave detailed answers to questions jointly raised by reporters in Guling today. Regarding peace talks, in addition to declaring the aforementioned opinions, the Chief also stated that withdrawing from Northern Jiangsu, implementing military reorganization, and restoring transportation remain the urgent themes to be realized in the continuing peace talks. He first gave a general overview of the military situation in Northern Jiangsu. To prevent further attacks, the National army on the Yangzhou-Hai'an line, after defensive adjustments, still strictly adheres to orders, not counterattacking unless attacked, and not attacking proactively. However, the Communist army has been slow to withdraw from Northern Jiangsu to the area north of the Longhai Railway, posing a great threat to Nanjing and Shanghai. In my meeting with the Communist Party representatives, I offered three plans for the Northern Jiangsu issue: the best plan was for the Communist army to withdraw, the middle plan was for the National Government to relocate the capital, and the worst plan was for an armed showdown. The Communist army was unwilling to implement the best plan, and the National Government had just returned the capital in May, so it was inconvenient to relocate again. As a result, they resorted to the worst plan, but did not go all the way, with only the Communist army hitting people and the National army being hit, without a real showdown. According to air force inspection reports, the Communist army has breached the dikes of the Yunshu Rivers in Northern Jiangsu, resulting in five areas in Northern Jiangsu becoming a vast expanse of water. Many people are climbing tree roots and rooftops to escape, a tragic sight to behold. A reporter asked: "Then the government is just watching without helping?" Chief Chen replied with a smile: "I will respect democracy and ask you all to discuss this." He continued: "I have spent half my life in the military, and I did not seek the limelight during the eight years of the War of Resistance, so why would I want to fight my own people to seek the limelight? Even from my perspective as Chief of General Staff, if a war really breaks out, the logistics, ammunition, medical treatment, and bereavement compensation will all be endless troubles, and my physical strength will be difficult to handle. The so-called 'war is dangerous' is not just the wishful thinking of anti-war activists. Therefore, in order to remove the threat to Nanjing and Shanghai and to save the people of Northern Jiangsu, the government will spare no effort to do its utmost to urge the Communist Party to comply with the order to withdraw from Northern Jiangsu and retreat to the area north of the Longhai Railway. As for the implementation of military reorganization, it is a necessary path for building the army and building the nation, and restoring transportation is a prerequisite for production and construction. The Communist Party must also earnestly fulfill its promises."

A reporter asked if there was a proposal for the Communist army to breach the five dams of the Grand Canal. Chief Chen replied that Mr. Zhou Enlai had submitted a memorandum to the Executive Yuan stating that the Grand Canal was flooded and requesting the opening of the five dams of the Grand Canal. He believed that since both the Yangtze River and Hongze Lake were rising, whether opening the five dams of the Grand Canal could accommodate its discharge flow should be jointly investigated by both sides and experts. Chief Chen also said that he and Mr. Zhou Enlai have a very close personal relationship and never make offensive slanders. The Communist army's dike-breaking in Northern Jiangsu and harming the people was probably something that Mr. Enlai could not foresee, nor could he end. In other words, whether Mr. Enlai's words and deeds today can represent the entire Communist Party and whether they can be kept by the Communist Party is highly questionable.

After Chief Chen finished this answer, he answered many more questions from reporters: (Question) Can you tell us the content of your meeting with Marshal Ma today? (Answer) Marshal Ma was very happy about the progress of the government's military reorganization. I told him that 59 divisions have been reorganized. As for the other topic we discussed, I know you all did not expect it, and even I did not expect it. Marshal Ma inquired in great detail about film education. (Question) What is the significance of the Communist Party's anti-Americanism? (Answer) Speaking in my personal capacity, the Communist Party created an Anping Incident similar in nature to the Boxer Rebellion to oppose the United States, which not only loses the personality of the Chinese people but also does not understand the principles of being human. The Communist Party seeks help from others on the one hand and hurts them on the other, contradicting itself and going back on its word, which I cannot agree with. (Question) Is there any progress in the investigation of the Li-Wen case? (Answer) I dare to say that this case was not committed by senior intellectuals. After the case is solved in the future, no matter who the main culprit is, the government will severely punish them.

Chief Chen felt very happy and relaxed at today's press conference. The Director of the Ministry of National Defense's Information Bureau was also present, and abundant refreshments were prepared.

### US Warships Rotate in Qingdao

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 7th] The U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet, which guards the Western Pacific, originally docked in Qingdao. Some of the warships have sailed to other places for rotation, and several more U.S. warships will arrive soon. Generally, 35 to 40 U.S. warships of various types are stationed in Qingdao.

[Another dispatch] The U.S. Marines stationed in Qingdao are watching the Communist Party's next move due to the Anping Incident. Rumors of the Marines withdrawing are inaccurate. However, the number of Marines whose terms have expired and should return to their country is equal to the number of personnel transferred to Qingdao.

### Establishing Peacetime National Defense

Forty Military Districts Established Nationwide

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] In order to establish peacetime national defense, the Ministry of National Defense will first establish military division and regimental districts and will accelerate the organization and training of national militia as replenishment for future soldiers, and also to refresh the regular conscription system. According to the plan that has been decided by the authorities, the country has now decided to establish forty military districts, with each district covering approximately seven million people and containing a varying number of regimental districts. There are 197 regimental districts throughout the country, with the jurisdiction of the regimental districts corresponding to the current provincial administrative inspectorate commissioner's offices. The candidates for the commanders of the division and regimental districts have all been internally determined separately.

### National Army in Rehe Province Enters Tianyi; Clearing Obstacles on Railway Line; Large Numbers of Communist Troops Discovered at Lengkou of the Great Wall

[Our Tianjin Office, 7th] Four brigades of Communist troops have been discovered at Lengkou of the Great Wall. Three regiments have reached An, and two regiments have reached Shaheyi, northwest of Xian County, with intentions to destroy the Beining Railway.

[Our Fushun Office, 6th] The 27th Executive Headquarters team went to Faku on the 26th to investigate the dispute between the National army and the Communist Party over the National army's entry into Faku on June 7th or 8th, and returned on the night of the 5th. It is reported that they collected a lot of relevant information.

[Our Fushun Office, 6th] It is reported that the National army in Rehe is clearing obstacles on the north side of the Lingyuan-Yebaishou-Lv Railway to protect the safety of the railway. There are no Communist troops south of Tianyi, and part of the National army has entered Tianyi. In addition, two brigades of Communist troops in Chengde are currently moving towards Pingquan.

### Supreme National Defense Council Passes Adjustment of Civil Servants' Salaries; Implemented Early This Month in All Regions

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The Supreme National Defense Council held an extraordinary meeting on the morning of the 7th, following the Central Standing Committee meeting, chaired by Song Ziwen.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The readjustment of the living allowance for central civil servants and teachers has been approved by the Standing Committee of the Supreme National Defense Council on the morning of the 7th. The payment methods for police and laborers have also been increased according to the new standards, and it was decided that they would all be implemented from August. According to regulations, the living allowance for central civil servants and teachers is adjusted every three months. The last revision was in June, and the next adjustment should have been in September. Recently, the government believed that the lives of civil servants and teachers were still difficult, so it made an adjustment in advance. The Executive Yuan drafted an adjustment table based on the recent price situation in various places, which was submitted to the National Defense Council for discussion and approval. The adjusted payment standards are: (1) Basic amount of 120,000 yuan, multiplied by 750 times (Dihua). (2) 110,000 yuan, 720 times (Nanjing, Shanghai).

### Gu Zhutong and Others to Go to Guling Immediately

Report on the Thorough Investigation of the Li-Wen Case; Liang Shuming and Zhou Xinmin Arrive in Kunming

[Central News Agency, Guling, 7th] Gu Zhutong, Lu Han, and Zhang Zhen will soon go to Guling from Kunming to report on the thorough investigation of the Li-Wen case.

[Our Kunming Office, 6th] Liang Shuming and Zhou Xinmin arrived in Kunming by plane from Chongqing at 9:20 AM on the 6th, representing the China Democratic League to investigate the Li-Wen case. The case was originally scheduled to be announced on the 6th, but as of the time of the telegram, it had not yet been announced. It is speculated by the general public that since Liang and Zhou have already arrived in Kunming, the announcement of the case may be postponed for a day or two.

### Marshal Ma Scheduled to Return to Nanjing Today; Communist Party Insists on Preconceived Notions, Negotiations Deadlocked

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Special Envoy Marshall will rush back to Nanjing from Guling before noon tomorrow. It is reported that Marshal Ma will conduct an in-depth study of current issues with Ambassador Stuart, and this important meeting may find a new path for the KMT-CPC negotiations.

[Central News Agency, Guling, 7th] Chief Chen Cheng visited Marshal Marshall at his residence at 4:00 PM on the 7th, and they talked under the shade of the trees in the residence, with Pi Zonggan translating, for one hour and twenty-five minutes before parting.

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] After Ambassador Stuart had a five-hour-long talk with Zhou Enlai last night, there was no activity today. In the morning, Ambassador Stuart paid a courtesy call on the Mexican Ambassador. In the afternoon, he received Wang Bingnan of the Communist Party delegation for half an hour, and then hosted foreign reporters at 5:30 PM. It is reported that Military Council President Long Yun will visit tomorrow morning. According to sources, the Anping Incident was an important topic in yesterday's meeting between Stuart and Zhou Enlai. Zhou Enlai expressed that it was an unfortunate incident and only made a forced explanation. However, Ambassador Stuart is currently waiting quietly for the reaction of American public opinion and does not want to affect the peace talks between the KMT and the CPC due to official matters. With the devout psychology of a religious believer, Ambassador Stuart always prays for the light that may return soon. Also, regarding the reorganization of the government, the government is currently considering it in light of the current situation.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Ambassador Stuart Leighton had a five-hour-long talk with CPC representative Zhou Enlai on the evening of the 6th. According to sources close to the Ambassador, yesterday's talk mostly revisited old issues and reviewed and exchanged views on issues related to the political consultation meeting, such as the cessation of military conflicts, the resumption of transportation, and the reorganization of the government.

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] According to an authoritative source, the Communist side has repeatedly made harsh demands, which have been rejected by the government. Recently, the government has also reportedly put forward a new opinion on the issues of troop reduction and garrison areas, which have not yielded results in the past negotiations. However, the Communist Party insisted on its established policy and refused to accept it, so judging from the current situation, it has indeed reached a deadlock and there is no possibility of negotiation. As for the Communist Party's repeated emphasis on the withdrawal of American troops, informed sources believe that even if all American troops in China were to withdraw, it would not have any impact on the current situation. Furthermore, American officials are unwilling to turn the issue between the KMT and the CPC into a Sino-American relations issue. It is reported that Ambassador Stuart, in addition to reporting to the U.S. State Department to prevent the situation from escalating, is currently waiting quietly for instructions from the White House to make a decision.

### British Ambassador Presents Credentials; Chairman Holds Special Talks After Ceremony; British Business Delegation to Visit China on the 9th

[Our Guling Office, 7th] The new British Ambassador to China, Sir Stevenson, presented his credentials to Chairman Chiang at the Chairman's residence at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 7th. After the ceremony, the Chairman had a special talk with the Ambassador in the reception room for 20 minutes. The Chairman told the Ambassador: "I hope we can be honest friends." At 4:00 PM, the Ambassador's wife visited the Chairman's wife at the residence and chatted, and they had refreshments together. The Chairman's wife inquired about the exact date of Lady Cripps' visit to China and expressed her welcome. At 7:30 PM, the Chairman and his wife held a lavish banquet for the Ambassador and his wife, and invited Mr. and Mrs. Wyatt, Mr. and Mrs. Maer, Chen Cheng, Director Li Jun of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Section Chief Liu Naifan of the Protocol Bureau, and Pi Zonggan, Huan, etc. to accompany them. After the meal, they went to the summer camp to watch the Yan Opera Troupe perform the Peking Opera "Lu Wenlong".

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Sir Stevenson is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 8th on the plane of General Wyatt, the British Prime Minister's representative to China.

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The members of the British Business Delegation to China have all been selected, except for one representative of the Trades Union Congress, and they will depart for China at the end of September.

The Ambassador told reporters that this trip was at the invitation of Chairman Chiang to spend the summer in Lushan and to tour Lushan, which was his first time.

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Diplomatic sources: Canadian Ambassador-General Enderlen is scheduled to fly to Guling on the 13th.

### The Eight Warships Carrying Private Goods: All Malicious Rumors

Remarks by the Minister of Navy

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Regarding the rumors that the eight new warships returning from the United States carried private goods such as cars, and that senior officials were punished as a result, Chief of Staff Zhou Xianzhang of the Naval Headquarters told reporters on the 7th that since a certain newspaper in Shanghai published malicious news on the 29th of last month, various newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai have also published intermittent reports. Cars are not small items, and the eight warships are not very large. They are all combat vessels and there is no room for cars in the cabins. If there were cars, they would have to be placed on the deck. Hours before the eight warships arrived in Nanjing, people and reporters were waiting at the dock. After the eight warships were berthed, reporters and people rushed to the eight warships in small boats. For half a month, officials and reporters from the central military and political organs have also visited. May I ask, who has seen cars placed on the ships? The Nanjing Municipal Government has registered all the car licenses in the city. Please check with the Municipal Government to see if any new cars have been registered recently. The matter of carrying private goods is also groundless. As for being assigned to the Shanghai Fleet Command, it is a return to the Chinese organization. Commander Lin Zun was our naval attache in the United States. This mission was to lead the eight warships back to China. Now that the eight warships have arrived in the capital, his mission is over and he will soon return to his original position. No one on the eight warships has been detained. The headquarters must distribute these new talents to the entire army in order to enrich it, so there are personnel transfers for both officers and soldiers, not just a few people.

### Anping Incident Investigation Procedure: US and Communist Sides Clash Fiercely; Government Representatives of the Executive Headquarters Mediate

[Our Beiping Office, 7th] The special team dispatched by the Executive Headquarters to investigate the Anping Incident is still stranded on the beach of investigation procedures. The reason is that the Communist Party advocated that the team should first go to the U.S. Marine Corps headquarters for investigation, then to the Communist Party's Jidong Military Region headquarters, and finally to the accident site, Anping Daxiaosha River for investigation. The U.S. side advocated going directly to the accident site without going to the Marine Corps headquarters and the Jidong Military Region headquarters. The two sides argued fiercely over this, causing them to slam the table. In this dispute, the government representatives are acting as mediators. Although this special team has repeatedly heard the sound of footsteps on the stairs, it has not yet come downstairs, but it has changed representatives several times. The current government representative has been replaced by Major General Zhang Shuheng, and the U.S. representative has been replaced by Davis, which shows how difficult it is for the team to depart.

### Chairman's Telegram to Major General Rockey, Comforting American Comrades Killed and Wounded

[Tianjin Dispatch from the United States Information Service, 7th] Chairman Chiang recently sent a telegram to Major General Rockey, Commander of the First Marine Division of the United States Navy, expressing his deep sympathy and regret for the comrades who were killed and wounded in the recent Anping ambush. He also conveyed his condolences to the Marine Corps and the families of the deceased and wounded.

### After the Anping Incident: A Glimpse of American Public Opinion; Both Moderates and Liberals Oppose Troop Withdrawal, Advocating Full Effort to Promote Stability in China

[Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent in Washington, 7th] After the Anping Incident, American public opinion remained relatively calm. Since the State Department spokesperson announced on the 5th that there was no change in the American policy towards China, the New York Herald Tribune and the Washington Post have both published editorials supporting the continued stationing of American troops in China. They stated that once American troops withdraw, China will inevitably become more chaotic. While American troops should not be used to participate in China's "civil war," their presence can, to some extent, encourage China to work towards expanding the government and allowing liberal elements to participate in the political power. The reporter observed that American public opinion, while not in favor of changing the policy towards China, demands that the government further clarify its policy to make it more transparent and not easily misunderstood. In general, American newspapers and radio commentators have differing opinions on the China issue. Some oppose the Communist Party, some oppose the Nationalist Party, some advocate that the United States should always mediate the dispute between the Nationalists and the Communists, and some advocate that the United States should completely withdraw from China. For example: (1) The moderates, represented by the New York Times, believe that the Nationalist Government is the only legitimate government in China, so the United States should fully support the Nationalist Government to create a peaceful and stable situation, so that it can shoulder the responsibility of maintaining peace in the Far East. (2) The liberals, represented by the New York Herald Tribune, advocate that the United States should use its full strength to help China establish a "coalition government," so that liberal elements inside and outside the Nationalist Party have the opportunity to grasp political power. (3) The Scripps-Howard newspaper group insists that the United States should not be intimidated into withdrawing and abandoning the China issue, leaving it to the Soviet Union to use the Communist Party to dominate China, thereby endangering the peace of the entire Pacific region. (4) The American Communist Party and its fellow travelers, such as the Daily Worker, representing the furthest left line, denigrate the Nationalist Government as a "corrupt regime," so American troops should withdraw as soon as possible, and aid to China should be stopped as soon as possible, to promote the collapse of the Nationalist Government and facilitate the Communist Party's takeover. (5) Representing the furthest right line, such as anti-communist religious figures, the Hearst newspaper group, which is known for its exclusive anti-Soviet and anti-communist commentaries, and isolationist and nationalist newspapers such as the Chicago Tribune and the New York Daily News, on the one hand, loudly advocate anti-Soviet rhetoric, and on the other hand, advocate that the United States should close itself off and not interfere in the affairs of other countries. From this, it can be seen that the extreme left and right wings both advocate withdrawing American troops, while the moderate and liberal centrists all oppose troop withdrawal. Most noteworthy is that the reports of American newspapers and news agencies' correspondents in China often influence the opinions of some Americans. Our government and all sectors of society should provide them with ample information at all times, so that they can report the truth of the Chinese political situation and the genuine hopes of the people to the American government and public. Among American newspapers with influential power, the New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune are currently the most important. The latter believes that the CCP will encounter military failure and be forced to adopt guerrilla warfare. If the Nationalist Party can earnestly implement the various reform promises it has made in its previous declarations and resolutions, it will be more successful in eliminating the threat of Chinese communism than military force. The American Policy Association on China, is also an organization recently launched by people in the United States who are deeply knowledgeable about the situation in China. They do not agree with the American government's excessive elevation of the status of the CCP, and the forced acceptance of the Communist Party's conditions by the Nationalist Government for unlimited concessions. Its sponsors include William Green, President of the American Federation of Labor, and Ernest J. King, former chairman of the US Red Cross in China, among others.

### Government Decides to Send Planes to Carry Foreign Reporters to Inspect the Truth of the Communist Army Breaching Dykes; Minister Bai Reports on the Current Situation on Various Fronts

[Nanjing Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 7th] In response to the request of foreign reporters, Minister Peng of the Propaganda Department and Minister Bai of the National Defense Department will prepare a special plane to carry the reporters to inspect the area above the Su-Bei and An-Bei regions where the Communist army destroyed river dykes and caused floods. This move is scheduled to be realized on the morning of the 9th.

Northern Jiangsu and Henan-Hubei Borders

[Nanjing Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 7th] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi reported on the current military situation in various regions at a reception for foreign reporters in the Central Propaganda Department today. According to reports, since the recovery of Rugao, Tianchang, and Xuyi along the Jinpu Railway in Northern Jiangsu, the Communist army's offensive has been thwarted. Taking advantage of the summer floods of the Yellow River and Huai River, they breached the dykes in the area north of Huaiyin on the Longhai Railway in four places. This vast expanse of water, in addition to trapping millions of people in deep water away from their homes, has also affected the Communist army's offensive disruption and the National Army's movements. As a result, the lines in Northern Jiangsu have been slightly eased. As for the Henan-Hubei border area, Li Xiannian's troops, numbering over 50,000, were divided into four groups a month ago and attempted to flee to western Henan and southern Shaanxi. However, because the local militia system in western Henan has always been known to be sound, the Communist army was unable to occupy any towns. After being intercepted by the militia, most of these 50,000 troops were dispersed or captured, leaving only over 7,000. Among them, 1,500 were led by Li Xiannian and are now fleeing to the Shanyang County area of the Qinling Mountains in southern Shaanxi.

Situation in Northeast China

Regarding the situation in Northeast China, Minister Bai stated that the Northeast has been quiet for a long time since the ceasefire. After the Communist army's failures in the three major battles of Shanhaiguan, Benxihu, and Sipingjie, it realized its weak strength. On the one hand, it organized the masses to step up training, and on the other hand, it transported troops from Shandong to expand its power. Therefore, when Chief Du Jianming invited Lin Biao to meet last time, Lin only sent Li Lisan as a representative, bringing harsh conditions that the government could not consider, preventing the negotiations from achieving any success, in order to delay and achieve the above-mentioned attempt. However, the Northeast region is extremely rich and the people can live and work in peace and contentment, so communist ideology is really difficult to have any effect.

Communist Conspiracy

Regarding the incident in which the National Army sent a plane to bomb the plane detained by the defense army in the suburbs of Yan'an, it did not cause any loss of life or property to the people, so this is not a matter of concern. As for the ambush on American naval personnel in Anping, it was a premeditated strategy by the Communist Party to confuse American public opinion and force the American government to withdraw American troops stationed in China. The unprovoked attack on the American Navy is the same as the attacks on the National Army in various places. This clearly points out that the Communist Party has no intention of peaceful negotiations. The continuation and success of the negotiations have suffered greatly from this atrocity. We are very pleased to read the statement of the spokesperson of the United States Department of State on August 5, because this statement proves that the United States government has accurate information on the Chinese situation and is not confused.

Communist Excuse

New York Times reporter Lippmann asked whether it was true that the Communist Party launched an offensive in Northern Jiangsu on July 10, claiming that the government had planned a fierce attack in Northern Jiangsu, so they took preemptive action. Minister Bai replied: This is completely untrue. The Communist Party's statement is actually a far-fetched excuse. The government has never planned to attack the Communist army, but in order to protect the people and maintain social order, the government cannot but take effective actions to curb the Communist army's attacks.

Adjusting Salaries

According to Minister Peng's announcement at a reception for foreign reporters, the government decided this morning to adjust the salaries of civil servants by more than 50%. The reasons for this automatic and early adjustment are: First, there has been no increase in legal tender in July of this year, which is an unprecedented phenomenon since the War of Resistance, indicating that the country's finances have become increasingly sound; Second, in addition to the general decline in the price of imported goods in recent times, the price of food in various provinces has generally fallen due to the autumn harvest, so raising salaries will not affect prices. Although this increase cannot solve the salary problem of civil servants, it can also show that the lives of civil servants are always of concern to the government authorities.

### The Story of "Two-Gun" Wang Bamei's Mutiny Is Inaccurate

[Hangzhou Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 7th] Huang Shiqi, the famous "two-gun" expert in western Zhejiang, also known to women and children as Wang Bamei, was previously rumored to have led more than 400 of his troops in a mutiny on July 23, fleeing to Taihu Lake and looting extensively in the area of Lügui, Jinshan. This is not confirmed. Wang's troops were reorganized by the government after the victory and listed as the Third Self-Defense Brigade of Pinghu County.

### Hankou Direct Tax Bureau Discovers Major Embezzlement Case by Tax Collectors; Colluding with Presidents of Various Guilds to Impose Additional Handling Fees; Managers of Related Businesses Handed Over to Court for Investigation

[Hankou Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 6th] The Hankou Direct Tax Bureau recently discovered a major embezzlement case in which tax collectors imposed additional "handling fees," collecting a total of more than 100 million yuan in illicit gains by charging an additional 20% handling fee on business tax. In order to simplify procedures and save time, the bureau stipulated that various trade guilds should submit collective declarations for business tax collection. The original intention was not to be faulted, but mid-level staff and tax collectors of the bureau took this opportunity to collude with the presidents of various guilds to collect handling fees under false pretenses. Huang You, section chief of the bureau's business section, discovered factual evidence, and the case was revealed layer by layer. The managers of Changchang Ginseng Shop and Sichuan Silver Ear Shop involved in the case have been handed over to the court for investigation, and other victims are also secretly reporting. According to general analysis, the most suspected masterminds of the case are Du Ban Hui Hongzhi and Business Section Chief Yang Ziduo of the bureau. Hui has denied it, while Yang has applied for resignation and returned more than one million yuan in handling fees collected from the ginseng industry guild to the guild. Afterwards, the local newspapers criticized Xu Zhifan, the director of the bureau. Xu replied, "The embezzlement was discovered by my investigation, but the newspapers revealed it too early, causing both the givers and receivers of bribes to fear crime and shirk their responsibilities, making it difficult for me to deal with. Reporters are too terrible." His words seemed full of frustration.

### Local Dispatches

Jiangyin: Searching for Communist Troops on the Chengwu Border

Near the intersection of Chengwu, in the areas of Liulu, Dongqing, Xinan, and Licheng, there are scattered Communist troops from Southern Jiangsu. Most of them are natives who withdrew north last year. Together with new recruits, they are very familiar with the local situation. They are divided into groups of dozens of people, lurking in the countryside. Liu Kaisheng, the chief of the second section of the Wujin Army, believes that "nurturing evil will cause a prairie fire." For a thorough plan, he has joined forces with the pacification inspection team of the First Pacification Headquarters, the Joint Defense Committee of Chengxiwu, and the border self-defense teams to search the rural areas of Chengwu for days. Starting from Hengshan Bridge, they advanced in separate routes and searched extensively after passing through Xin'an Shiyan. The leaders of these small groups are Wu Xian, a former resident of Zhou Zun Village in Xixiang, Jiangyin, who once served as the puppet county magistrate of Danyang, and Li Shunzhi (from Licheng). They lead about two machine guns and more than thirty long and short rifles. The cadres are Zheng Qin, Zhang Beisheng, Liu Beiqian, Chen Yuanda, etc., who are rampant in various villages. The authorities have been paying close attention.

Changshu: Investigating the Crimes of Traitorous Father and Sons

Ge Qinan, Ge Zhongyuan, and Ge Bofang, residents of Cangheyan, Yingchun Bridge, outside Xiaodongmen, a family of three father and sons, all served as staff members of the puppet field tax collection office and interpreters for the Luantian Bing Three Brigade during the War of Resistance. After the victory, they were arrested and imprisoned by the authorities on charges of treason. The Jiangsu High Court is examining their crimes. Now, Ma has confirmed the crimes and ordered the local court here to notify the township office to assist in the investigation within three days in order to make a ruling.

Suzhou:

Robbery Failed, Bandit Killed

Yang Yanbin, the rebel general claiming to be the commander-in-chief of the "Jiangnan Democratic Allied Army" entrenched in Taihu Lake, relied on the notorious bandit Liu Hualong as his helper. Liu hid on the shore of East Taihu Lake and often fled to rural areas around Yunze, Nanxun, and Huzhou. Recently, the Wujiang County Government discovered his whereabouts and arrested him at the intersection of Jiangsu and Zhejiang at the end of July. The Wujiang County Government sent armed police to Yindi, and at around 6 p.m. on the afternoon of the third, when they were passing near the Bailong Bridge, about two miles away from Bacan Town, they were suddenly encountered by more than 20 bandits who fired to stop the prisoner. The police and bandits engaged in a fierce battle lasting 30 minutes. Fortunately, the Bacan Town Self-Defense Team heard the alarm and rushed to support them, and the bandits began to falter and fled towards Taihu Lake. During the chaos, the notorious bandit Liu Hualong secretly tried to escape by crossing the shore, but was killed by stray bullets. The Wujiang County Government has now dispatched strong forces to search for the bandits around Bacan. Liu's death is tantamount to a major blow to Yang Yanbin.

Water Police Patrol Taihu Lake: Zhang Shaohua, the captain of the Second Detachment of Water Police, felt that the Taihu Lake, in his jurisdiction, was full of lake bandits, and that travelers viewed it with fear. So Zhang personally led his First Brigade on the 4th, equipped with machine guns and small cannons, and patrolled from Suzhou to Taihu Lake by motorboat. He arrived in Wuxi that night, and on the 5th he went to Wujin. He is scheduled to go to the key points of Taihu Lake such as Yixing and Heqiao on the 6th, and is scheduled to return to Suzhou on the 8th.

Wuxi:

Kidnapping, Murder, and Destruction of Evidence

On the evening of the 27th of last month, more than a dozen people claiming to be members of the self-defense team from the western temple of Dangko Town, brought weapons and kidnapped Zhao Zhicheng (from Taixing), a friend of the abbot monk Jue Wu, and has not been heard from since. There is a lot of talk in the countryside, saying that after Zhao Zhicheng was arrested, he was first tortured in private and seriously injured, making him unable to move. Afterwards, he was killed, his body cut into several pieces, placed in an oil drum, and buried in a desolate tomb that night to destroy the evidence. The villagers said it with certainty. Zhao's wife, Xu, is from Jiangyin. On the 5th, she cried to the Jiangyin Township Association, recounting the details of Zhao Zhicheng's murder, and asked for justice. After receiving the report, the association decided to organize a Zhao case support committee to appeal for justice, in order to maintain humanity. It is heard that the members of the town's self-defense team are mixed, mostly former enemies and traitors. Li Zhanze, the captain of the county's security brigade, has sent staff to the countryside to investigate, and has scheduled to go to the countryside himself on the 12th to investigate the truth, so that he can pursue the case.

Editorial

### America's China Policy Remains Unchanged

The U.S. State Department spokesperson stated on the 5th of this month that the current U.S. policy toward China remains the same as announced by Acting Secretary of State Acheson on June 28th, with no changes. It was also stated that rumors from Nanjing that the U.S. President had instructed the planning of the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China are incorrect. This is a very important statement.

Since the "unfortunate incident" in Anping occurred, it has been widely rumored that the U.S. policy towards China would change. On the one hand, the Chinese Communists admitted that the Anping incident was a "regret," but on the other hand, they protested to the U.S. military, saying that the fundamental solution lies in the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. Needless to say, friends intoxicated by Communist propaganda, whether in China or in the United States, would echo and advocate that the United States change its policy toward China, withdraw its troops from China, and no longer interfere in China's affairs. It seems that the Communist Party's plan for "expelling American influence from China," which has been planned for half a year, is about to mature and can be achieved as they wish. Now, after the solemn statement by the spokesperson of the U.S. State Department, the situation has been clarified.

Indeed, we can see that the American government and public are feeling troubled by the China issue. However, we dare to frankly point out to our American allies that the United States fought alongside China during the war and has been assisting China in its efforts for peaceful unification after the war, hoping that China can become a unified, democratic, and strong country, and that it can undertake the task of a member of the United Nations in the Far East and jointly maintain world peace. Our Chinese government and people, no matter what, will definitely strive towards this goal and will never let themselves down, let alone the good intentions of the United States and other allied countries. China is currently in a transitional period, learning democracy, and moving towards the road of democratic politics. Unfortunately, there is an armed Communist Party that still relies on its armed forces and is unwilling to follow the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, as well as the plans to stop conflicts, restore transportation, and reorganize the army, so that the situation of peaceful unification still has to wait for a considerable period. However, as seen by Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, as long as we "do not let abnormal conditions affect normal conditions" and everyone is not stimulated by the "Anping Incident" and continues to strive towards the original goal, we still believe that the overall situation in China is hopeful.

World peace is indivisible, and the United States can no longer be isolated! This is a well-known trend in the world, and it is also the common understanding of enlightened people in the American government and the public. Secretary of State Byrnes recently made such a clear announcement. Therefore, the United States cannot stand by and watch the overall situation in China; however, precisely because of this, the United States is deeply concerned that Marshal Marshall's efforts for more than half a year have not been able to fully achieve its mission. Former U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles's remarks on July 28th frankly pointed out the reason why the Chinese Communist leaders refuse to agree to adopt an equal and constructive solution to their disputes with the central government; this is precisely the focus of the United States' real concern. Generally speaking, the views of American public opinion on the China issue, just as reported in this newspaper's Washington dispatch yesterday, are also quite inconsistent. Some oppose the Communist Party, some oppose the Kuomintang, some advocate that the United States should always mediate between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and some advocate that the United States should completely withdraw from China as soon as possible. We deeply know that the American government and the public have an expectation for China, that it will unify, democratize, and become strong as soon as possible, which is entirely out of good intentions. Therefore, no matter what their views are, it is just that their opinions may differ, and they do not harbor any ill will towards China. In any case, we Chinese journalists have an obligation to make the United States truly understand the situation in China. We dare to say that wars in the world often arise from international estrangement, and international estrangement is partly due to the provocations of some warmongers and partly due to the incomplete and inaccurate news reports between countries, as well as the failure to fully exchange genuine public opinion. Therefore, under the major premise that we firmly believe that the U.S. policy toward China remains unchanged, we still believe that Chinese intellectuals, whether they are journalists, educators, or entrepreneurs, should frankly and candidly provide their legitimate opinions on national affairs at this time to help the United States and other allied countries understand the situation in China.

Our opinion, simply put, has only the following points: (1) China needs unity and even more peace. Only under the situation of unity and peace can China embark on the road to democracy and strength, can the national strength and people's livelihood be restored, and can it truly fulfill the tasks that a member of the United Nations should bear. We believe that the Chinese people's hope is very clear to the authorities of the National Government, and since the Japanese surrendered, the National Government has indeed been working towards this goal. The rumors that there are some reactionary elements or stubborn factions in the Kuomintang colluding with reactionary elements in the United States to obstruct peaceful unification, we believe, are a consistent trick of the Communist Party's distorted propaganda for many years and are by no means facts. The Kuomintang's nation-building plan is divided into three stages: military administration, tutelage administration, and constitutional administration, and today's procedure has reached the stage of transitioning from tutelage administration to constitutional administration. The Kuomintang has never advocated "one-party dictatorship" to the end, and today it has no intention of excluding other parties. Just look at the National Government's first accommodating of non-partisan and non-factional virtuous people, as well as its eager hope to convene the National Assembly as soon as possible to return power to the people, and you can know the absurdity of the saying that the stubborn faction is hindering democracy.

(2) The success of China's peaceful unification cannot be achieved by unilateral efforts. The National Government certainly hopes for peaceful unification, but what about the armed Communist Party? People often like to compare China with France, thinking about how France united after the war and how it jumped to become the balancing power in Europe, and then sighed at China's lack of ambition. However, we must recall an article by Powell published by the China Weekly Review not long after the Japanese surrendered last year, that China has something different from the situation in France. France does not have an armed Communist Party, this is one. The French Communist Party is willing to engage in political competition in a peaceful environment, rather than relying on guerrillas or underground troops, and openly raise the banner of rebellion, this is two. France is one of the four powers jointly occupying Germany, and France's border is not connected to the territory of the Soviet Union, and there has been no incident like the independence of Outer Mongolia and the events in Xinjiang and the Northeast, this is three. In short, China and France are in different situations, and the Chinese government, after the signing of the Sino-Soviet Alliance and Friendship Treaty, has been willing to abide by the treaty at all times and in all places, and become an allied country with the Soviet Union that gets along friendly for thirty years, especially willing to become a bridge in the Far East issue for the United States and the Soviet Union to jointly maintain world peace. This is an obvious fact, but in order to achieve this noble task, the Communist Party must take into account the position of the country and the nation, implement the plan of reorganization and unified compilation, completely hand over the army to the country, and turn itself into an ordinary political party, and then China can truly shoulder this task. If this cannot be done, and the Communist Party still has different intentions everywhere, and always wants to create a divided and turbulent China, then whose responsibility it is that China cannot achieve peaceful unification soon is self-evident.

(3) Before the Communist Party changes its attitude, we predict that the Communist Party's opposition to the National Government, and even the opposition to the United States, will emerge endlessly. And the United States, being stimulated by it, will make a big mistake if it withdraws its troops. The Communist Party originally hoped that, due to its distorted propaganda, it might cause the United States to exert extreme pressure on the National Government to accept all the Communist Party's unreasonable demands. Therefore, when Marshal Marshall came to China, he was called the "angel of peace," and when Ambassador Stuart announced his new appointment, he also expressed an unusually welcome. But once it feels that the U.S. policy toward China is fair and impartial, it opposes the U.S. representative's arbitration power, it kidnaps the American soldiers in Tianjin, it attacks the U.S. Marines passing through Anping, it shouts loudly that American reactionary elements are helping China's "civil war," and it everywhere advocates that the United States must withdraw its troops stationed in China as soon as possible. In other words, if the United States can help the Communist Party, the Communist Party will welcome it; conversely, if the United States is fair and impartial, the Communist Party will be anti-American. They hope that after the U.S. troops withdraw, they can start their "full-scale rebellion" in the Northeast, North China, and even the whole of China, and China may become a divided situation. Just look at the siege of Datong in Shanxi these days, the turmoil in Rehe, and the editorial in the Huazhong Xinhua Daily in Huaiyin inciting a full-scale guerrilla war, and you can get a glimpse of the Communist Party's attempt. Therefore, the editorials of the New York Herald Tribune and the Washington Post on the 6th pointed out that the reason why the U.S. troops stationed in China cannot withdraw at this time is to prevent China's political, military, and economic chaos and to prevent the cutting off of various transportation lines, which is indeed a pertinent remark.

In short, we believe that China does need peace, and the first thing is naturally to prevent the war fabricated by the current Communist Party from expanding. The stationing of U.S. troops in China can assist China in completing this task. We certainly do not hope that U.S. troops will be stationed in China permanently, and especially do not want to implicate the United States for a long time because of China's problems, but at this time, the U.S. troops stationed in China still have the task of assisting China in repatriating enemy prisoners of war and refugees, and restoring peace and order. For the sake of China's peace and for the sake of world peace, we agree that the United States should implement its fair and constructive policy towards China.

### First Father's Day After Victory

China's Father's Day did not start today; but today is the first Father's Day after victory, an important day from the birth of Father's Day to its adoption by various countries in the world. Recalling China's Father's Day, it actually started on August 8th, 1945, initiated by ten leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai, including Yan Huisheng and Yuan Xilian. At that time, it was during the final battle in the Far East, and the enemy bandits were rampant, and the environment was dangerous. The initiation of this Father's Day was actually an implication of remembrance and national awakening; therefore, the leaders ascended and called out, and the masses responded. At that time, there was a warm Father's Day celebration in Shanghai. Later, celebrities from all walks of life, such as Pan Gongzhan, Li Shizeng, and Song Hanzhang, believed that the holding of Father's Day was a pure expression of national righteousness during the Anti-Japanese War and that it was necessary to promote it. Therefore, they submitted a request to the municipal authorities to forward it to the central government, requesting that August 8th be designated as Father's Day and that it be promulgated to the whole country for compliance. The sentence in their submission read: "...The initiation of Father's Day is purely a pure expression of national consciousness during the Anti-Japanese War, which is not incompatible with the Mother's Day initiated by the United States after the First European War, and complements each other, for the sake of commemorating the history of the Anti-Japanese War, and for the sake of accumulating national morality, it should be clearly stipulated by the central government and permanently designated as a holiday." Now, we have come across this Father's Day with profound significance again. Although the central government's explicit order has not yet arrived, the people's feelings for this Father's Day that commemorates the grace of the father are even more joyful. Although the launch of this Father's Day was in Shanghai, because of its profound significance, it is believed that the people of the whole country will definitely rise up in response, and the people of other parts of the world will also follow suit and commemorate Father's Day with enthusiasm, so as to shine after the Mother's Day initiated after the First World War and promote the lofty love of mankind.

From the standpoint of the Chinese people, there is nothing better than the holding of Father's Day to leave a permanent memorial for our eight-year long struggle. War is an ominous event. The construction of a state by two countries is not necessarily the intention of all the people. China has been invaded by Japanese warlords for the longest time and has suffered the most severely, but we cannot use this to think that all the Japanese people harbor the intention of invading China; among them, how can there not also be those who are intimidated by the power of the warlords, so they provide service to the warlords. If we want to leave a permanent memorial for this Sino-Japanese war, we must make this memorial acceptable to both the Chinese and Japanese people. In our eight years of struggle, there is no shortage of heroic days that can leave a permanent memorial for our national war; but only the holding of this Father's Day can grasp the feelings of the Chinese people and the feelings of the Japanese people and become a holiday that can be commemorated by both the Chinese and Japanese people. Chinese people have fathers, and Japanese people also have fathers; Father's Day was born during the Sino-Japanese War, so that the Chinese people can associate it with the suffering they encountered during the Anti-Japanese War, and the Japanese people can associate it with how they were used by the warlords to launch the invasion of China, which led to today's defeat. The holding of this holiday should enable the people of China and Japan to have a deeper understanding; therefore, it is most appropriate for us to use Father's Day as a memorial for our eight-year long struggle.

However, the holding of Father's Day is naturally not entirely to commemorate the Anti-Japanese War; it also has the supreme intention of carrying forward and developing our country's inherent virtues. Since "Down with the Confucian Shop" and the advocacy of "anti-filial piety," our country's inherent ethics and morality have been frequently attacked, resulting in a gradual decline in the moral standards of our people. The reason why a country stands, ultimately, must rely on morality to maintain it. Although Western Europe and other parts of the Soviet Union do not have an ethical system like ours, their people are deeply influenced by Christianity, and the doctrines of Christianity are very close to our traditional ethical concepts. The "love" spoken of in Christianity originally includes our "filial piety." "Filial piety" and "love" are essentially two in one. Western European countries, their material civilization is extremely developed, if there is no spiritual civilization of Christianity to serve as their backbone, I really don't know what kind of world it will become. Our long-term Anti-Japanese War has now ended, and the country is advancing on the road to nation-building. At this time, we should especially restore our country's inherent and good traditional morality, so that our nation-building cause can have a good spiritual foundation. In the effort to restore our country's inherent morality, the holding of this Father's Day will undoubtedly benefit the world and people's hearts. The establishment of customs can refresh the people's ears and eyes, and express our country's traditional virtues with a new attitude and a new style.

The reason why Father's Day is set on August 8th is not only because the eight-eight connection is shaped like the character "father," and the sound is also similar to the word "dad," but there may be another profound meaning here. The weather in August is in the middle of summer, with the scorching sun in the sky. Parents sweat all day long and work hard tirelessly, originally hoping for their children; and for the children, in the long and hot summer, if they think of the hard work of their parents, they should think more about the way to repay them. August is the end and the beginning of the academic year, and in the blink of an eye, it will be cool in the autumn, and the students will be entering school one after another. At this time, when we commemorate our father, and think about how to repay him, there is nothing better than the donation of scholarships. Helping others to become talented is the greatest joy. At the same time as the holding of the first Father's Day after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it is also planned to hold the solicitation of scholarships. We hope that the "filial piety" can enthusiastically donate, which is the best way to commemorate the father and repay his deep grace.

Finally, because we have the holding of Father's Day, we hope that our spirit can inspire people in Western Europe and other countries to also have the holding of Father's Day on the same day. The launch of Mother's Day was after the First World War. Now that the Second World War is over, there are many fathers in the world who cannot see their beloved children, and there are many children who cannot see their kind father return. They may be on a deserted island in the Pacific, in a desert in Africa, or in remote places, with tombs facing the Xiaofeng Canyue. We want to commemorate them. It is because of their death that we have our lives. This Father's Day was launched in China, which has been most deeply harmed by aggression. This is a gift from the Chinese people to repay the help of the allied countries; we hope that after this, the second and third generations and even the fathers of later generations can be spared the encounters that our generation has encountered.

### Regulations Committee Passes US Proposal, Decides to Invite Five Former Enemy States; Adopts British-South African Amendment After Three Days of Heated Debate; Voting System Issue Finally Resolved Yesterday

[Special Dispatch] Paris, July 7th (Emergency Broadcast): US Secretary of State Byrnes today proposed to the Regulations Committee that former enemy states be invited to attend the plenary session of the peace conference on August 10th. Mr. Byrnes stated: "Please have the Secretariat extend invitations to the five former enemy states - Holland, Romania, Italy, Bulgaria, and Finland - to attend the peace conference, so that they may present their views in the plenary session. This invitation was pre-determined by the Council of Foreign Ministers." Soviet representative Vyshinsky believed Mr. Byrnes' proposal was reasonable, but added that each former enemy state should not only be allowed to express its views in the plenary session, but also be allowed to attend the subcommittees, and this should be stipulated. Mr. Byrnes readily accepted the supplementary proposal. British Under-Secretary of State McNeil advocated that the invitation should be issued by the entire Regulations Committee, not just by one member state; Mr. Byrnes also agreed. The US proposal was unanimously passed.

[Special Dispatch] Paris, July 7th (Emergency Broadcast): The Yugoslavian representative has requested permission for Albania to participate in the peace conference. Also, Italian Prime Minister Gasperi led a delegation to Paris today. A memorandum from the delegation regarding the Franco-Italian border issue was submitted to the peace conference this morning.

[Special Dispatch] Paris, July 7th (Emergency Broadcast): Regulations Committee Chairman Spaak has announced that the amendment concerning voting procedures has been unanimously adopted by the committee.

[Special Dispatch] Paris, July 7th (Broadcast): During the Regulations Committee meeting this afternoon, the amendment proposed by Yugoslavia encountered no opposition, which surprised Chairman Spaak. Yugoslavia proposed that any proposal from a relevant country that is not adopted within the peace conference could be directly submitted to the Council of Foreign Ministers. This amendment has now been unanimously passed by the committee.

[Special Dispatch] Paris, July 7th (Broadcast): During today's peace conference meeting, Australian representative Evatt expressed his willingness to withdraw the Australian amendment to the voting procedure. Dutch representative Stikker also made a similar declaration. British Under-Secretary of State McNeil immediately congratulated Chairman Spaak on his successful promotion of compromise. The atmosphere in the meeting hall became more relaxed, and the representatives fully demonstrated their great spirit of compromise.

(Agence France-Presse, Paris, July 7th) The Regulations Committee held three night meetings yesterday, with the final meeting ending at 2:30 AM the following morning. The British amendment to the peace conference voting rules was passed by a vote of fifteen to six. The amendment stipulated that peace conference proposals would be divided into two categories: one category requiring a simple majority to pass, and the other requiring a two-thirds majority to pass. Both categories of proposals must be submitted to the Council of Foreign Ministers for review. Previously, the French representative proposed an attached amendment, which was rejected by a vote of thirteen to eight. The Dutch representative's proposal that the Regulations Committee's voting should adopt a simple majority system was also rejected by a vote of ten to nine.

(Agence France-Presse, Paris, July 7th) After a four-hour meeting last night, the Regulations Committee of the peace conference resolved the most thorny issue on the agenda, namely the voting rules. The representatives at the peace conference felt relieved this morning. During the morning meeting yesterday, US Secretary of State Byrnes and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov engaged in a fierce debate, and the crisis of a public break-up of the peace conference threatened to escalate.

The Rift Widens Further, Chairman Promotes Compromise

During the afternoon meeting, Byrnes and Yugoslavian representative Kardelj engaged in another heated exchange, further widening the rift. Fortunately, Committee Chairman and Foreign Minister Spaak bravely stepped forward and was finally able to promote a compromise. Before the evening meeting, Spaak consulted with the chief representatives for fifteen minutes. Recognizing that it was difficult to reach an agreement immediately, Spaak decided to resume open discussion during the evening meeting. For two full hours, Spaak strived for compromise, but was surrounded by a series of questions, interferences, suggestions, requests, and explanations. The debate not only made no progress, but actually regressed. Of particular note was that the consistently hostile attitude between the US and Soviet representatives during the morning meeting evolved into a sharp confrontation between the British and Soviet delegations during the evening meeting. The two main British representatives, First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander and Under-Secretary of State McNeil, issued stern statements, but Soviet representatives Molotov and Vyshinsky responded in kind. Byrnes reclined in his chair, observing the verbal battle between the British and Soviet representatives with curiosity.

Britain Wags its Lion's Tail, Ultimately Achieves Victory

However, when the "rebellious" amendments of the smaller countries were put to a vote, the three major powers suddenly united and worked together to defeat the New Zealand amendment. The Soviet Union was satisfied with one important point because the amendment advocated a simple majority system, while the Soviet Union's all-day fire was aimed at supporting the two-thirds majority rule. But the real test came when the British amendment was put to a vote, which stipulated that both a simple majority system and a two-thirds majority system should be included. The Soviet delegation tried to defeat this amendment, but part of the amendment also conformed to the Soviet side's views. The British lion's tail then wagged rapidly. The British representative resolutely rejected any compromise, and Britain ultimately achieved victory, just as the Soviet Union had achieved victory when voting on the New Zealand amendment. It can now be fully expected that the Regulations Committee will proceed smoothly in the future and conclude its work on the afternoon of the 8th. At that time, the peace conference can change direction and begin to consider the various peace treaty drafts proposed by the Council of Foreign Ministers.

### Clear Division Between Two Major Blocs, Many Hidden Reefs Remain in the Future of the Peace Conference

[Special Dispatch] Paris, July 7th (Broadcast): A serious rift has developed between the Soviet bloc and the Western powers, which is enough to threaten the success of the 21-nation peace conference. Delegates to the conference, seeing the animosity arising from the disputes in the Regulations Committee, feel deeply anxious and anticipate that the conference will trigger fierce debate, cunning tactics, and delaying policies when discussing the draft peace treaties. Due to the continuous debates over the past week, the representatives all feel exhausted. As a result, the Regulations Committee did not hold its usual meeting this morning, but only held a meeting in the afternoon. Observers believe that France's loyalty to the Western powers and China's open support for the Western bloc are particularly noteworthy. Molotov and Vyshinsky spoke a total of thirteen times during yesterday's long debate. Although they engaged in heated exchanges and used clever tactics, they suffered miserable defeats in every decisive vote.

### US and British Experts to Draft Outline of Peace Treaty with Japan

(United Press, London, July 6th) According to well-informed diplomatic sources, experts from the US State Department and the British Foreign Office have completed drafting the draft peace treaty with Japan.

It is said that US and British experts are only exchanging views on technical aspects and are only drafting the outline of the peace treaty, without yet addressing the details.

### Palestine Issue Reaches Delicate and Critical Stage, US Reply Not Yet Delivered to London, Arabs and Jews Urge Britain to Abandon Mandate

[Reuters, London, July 6th] The Palestine issue, which has reached a delicate and critical stage, will be discussed by the British Cabinet tomorrow. It is not yet known whether President Truman's resolution on the partition plan for Palestine will be delivered to London by then. It is rumored that powerful Jewish figures in the United States are applying maximum pressure to get the US President to reject the plan.

[Reuters, Washington, July 6th] Acting US Secretary of State Acheson told reporters here that the US government has not yet decided whether to reject or accept the new plan regarding Palestine. This matter must be determined after consultation between President Truman's cabinet's Palestine committee and the US experts who drafted the plan.

[Agence France-Presse, Beirut, July 6th] According to Arab sources here, the best solution to the Palestine problem is to revoke the British mandate over the region and declare Palestine an independent state, joining the Arab League. Jews would enjoy broad autonomy, with rights completely equal to those enjoyed by Arabs. Furthermore, it is widely believed that the foreign ministers of Arab countries will hold a meeting in Alexandria from the 10th to the 15th. It is reported that this meeting will discuss various political issues, including the Anglo-Egyptian treaty.

[United Press, New York, July 6th] The Jewish Nationalist League, representing 12,000 Americans, today joined with other Jewish organizations in opposing the partition of Palestine, arguing that Britain should hand over its mandate and withdraw its troops.

### British Cabinet Authorizes Wavell to Form Indian Interim Government, New Proposals Being Actively Drafted

[Reuters, New Delhi, July 7th] An authoritative government official said that the British cabinet has given Viceroy Wavell complete freedom to proceed with the formation of an interim government. Significant progress is expected within the week. The Viceroy's proposals are expected to be actively drafted, as the Congress Working Committee will begin its meeting in Wardha on August 8th. The Viceroy's decision has two options: one is to continue to allow the Muslim League to participate in the Executive Council, and the other is to only allow the Congress Party and certain specific ethnic minorities to participate. If the former approach is taken, he should ask the Muslim League and the Congress Party to simultaneously submit the names of their representatives. The Congress Party is expected to nominate six people, the Muslim League is expected to nominate five people, and ethnic minorities are expected to nominate two or three people.

### British Aircraft Carrier "Colossus" Transferred to French Navy

[Agence France-Presse, Portsmouth, July 6th] The British aircraft carrier "Colossus" was officially transferred to the French fleet this morning. The aircraft carrier is leased to the French Navy for a period of five years, at the end of which the French government will immediately return it to Britain or purchase it at cost. During the handover ceremony this morning, Prime Minister Attlee conferred the command of the aircraft carrier to French Navy Colonel Garon, lowered the British flag and replaced it with the French flag. A total of 750 French naval officers and soldiers then boarded the ship in an orderly manner. This ship, with a displacement of 17,000 tons, was built during the war and was originally intended to be sent to the Pacific for combat, but the war ended before it could be deployed.

### Byrnes and Molotov Engage in Four-Hour Verbal Battle, Each Side Sticks to its Own Opinion and Counterattacks, Atmosphere in Meeting Hall Once Became Tense

"Reuters, Paris, July 6th" The Regulations Committee of the Paris Peace Conference met this morning in a tense atmosphere. For the past four hours, US Secretary of State Byrnes and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov engaged in a fierce debate. When the Regulations Committee resumed debating the issue of voting on proposals by a two-thirds majority or by a simple majority,

Byrnes immediately criticized Molotov, accusing him of misunderstanding the attitude of the US delegation. Byrnes also pointed to the Soviet delegation from time to time, refuting Molotov's statement yesterday that the US had rejected the Soviet proposal to convene a meeting of the four foreign ministers during the Paris Peace Conference. He stated: Molotov's purpose in advocating the convening of a meeting of the four foreign ministers was to manipulate and preside over the meetings of the committees. His intention was to have the Council of Foreign Ministers consider the various proposals, but he also knew that this was not in line with the facts. This misunderstands the US position. I hope that all participating member states can understand this fact. When the Soviet representative does not get his way, he often arbitrarily attacks the motives of his colleagues, but this strategy does not help him, and even the most patient person will eventually express anger. Furthermore, the United States' resolution in paying attention to the Soviet Union is to often limit a small number of countries from concluding the great cause of peace, while the US delegation has always advocated broad participation by 21 countries. As in the London Council of Foreign Ministers last autumn and the two Paris conferences, the United States defended the rights of France and China to participate in various discussions. When the US delegation moved for an amendment to the rules of procedure, Molotov's words and deeds were inconsistent when the US delegation supported it. For example, last week, the Soviet representative suggested amending the already drafted peace treaty so that Poland could participate in the committee meeting discussing the Hungarian issue. Also, when deciding to invite various countries to participate in the peace conference, there was no mention of procedural issues at the time, but Molotov insisted the next day that a draft of the procedural rules must be attached before the invitation could be issued. I have repeatedly stated that if the Council of Foreign Ministers submits a draft procedure to the peace conference, the United States will reserve the right to support reasonable proposals from participating countries, but this procedural rule must not bind the peace conference, and the peace conference should formulate its own procedural rules. This statement has been recorded in the minutes of the Council of Foreign Ministers, and I have also made many speeches with the same meaning. Molotov has participated in various meetings many times and must have heard this statement. I think he will agree that his speech yesterday will inevitably cause my surprise. Judging from this, what Molotov can say must only be to agree to support the procedural rules put forward by the Council of Foreign Ministers. The US representative is determined to keep his word. The records I just mentioned can be judged by you and the public. We in the United States have newspapers with freedom of speech, so the Soviet representative can know that his remarks criticizing the motives of the US delegation will surely be published in the newspapers. I trust the Soviet people, and I ask Molotov to publish my speech this morning in the Soviet newspapers for the Soviet people to read. When the United States agreed to provide assistance, the Soviet people did not doubt the United States, and we did our best to provide assistance. We admire the Soviet people. Although we are criticizing Molotov today, it does not diminish our admiration for the Soviet people. When Byrnes was speaking,

Molotov repeatedly tilted his head, listening to the interpreter's translation. He then stood up to reply, and the atmosphere in the meeting hall was in turmoil. When Molotov spoke, he did not reduce his calm tone, but waved his arms from time to time, stating: The Soviet delegation suggested convening a meeting of the four foreign ministers to discuss several issues, including the chairmanship committee. This is a fact, but is there any concern that this can be criticized? Is there anything hindering our work? The Soviet delegation also wanted to set the procedure before the meeting, which is also a fact, and to be precise, the procedure has already been drafted. We discussed this procedural issue for a week, but before opening this peace conference, we have not discussed the main issues. If we do not predetermine the procedure first, it will take another week, - the third week - to obtain a resolution. This is also a fact. I believe that predetermining the procedure is an extremely proper process, but this draft procedural rules is by no means manipulating the peace conference, but only for reference. The point that we advocate that the four foreign ministers should meet from time to time during the peace conference is to facilitate the four foreign ministers' discussion of the various issues studied by the peace conference and to exchange opinions. When the debate on this matter began, several countries withdrew their reservations, but in fact this draft procedure has been unanimously adopted by the Council of Foreign Ministers. Today, several countries seem to have gone astray in the peace conference, but the Soviet Union and France are still following the decisions of the Council of Foreign Ministers. The British and American delegations are talking about their reservations, and this cannot be regarded as consistent words and deeds. We do not need to argue right and wrong here, but please judge based on the facts. The amendment proposed by the Soviet Union has been agreed to by the four foreign ministers. Our intention is to prevent possible opposition. If there are objections to this amendment, we can discuss it further, but the purpose of this amendment is not to overthrow the joint resolution of the Council of Foreign Ministers, nor to allow this resolution to be abandoned. Byrnes means to declare that the procedural rules cannot bind small countries. We believe that this is unnecessary, because this has been agreed to by the four countries and supported by the countries participating in the peace conference. We support Byrnes' suggestion, and the problem has been solved. Regarding the issues that have not yet been agreed upon, we can freely judge them, freely express our opinions, and the Soviet delegation will pay attention to listening to the opinions of all countries, consider them carefully, and pay attention to any suggestions that are beneficial to the peace conference and peace. Byrnes requested that Soviet newspapers publish his speech because his speech yesterday has been published in American newspapers. We can accept this proposal. His full speech will be published in Soviet newspapers for the Soviet people to read. Regarding freedom of speech, some people have heard that the American press has an organization that controls most of the American newspapers. For example, British Attorney General Shawcross recently criticized some British newspapers and advocated that British newspapers should publish "This newspaper is run by whom" and "No guarantee that the records are consistent with the facts" on the front page. We have the same feeling and sympathize with the fact that they cannot read newspapers with fair opinions. The Soviet delegation now hopes to ensure that Soviet newspapers hold fair opinions to live up to expectations," Molotov said sincerely, and everyone listened attentively to Molotov's satire. The Soviet delegation occasionally laughed, and Byrnes also listened to the satire. Chairman Spaak announced that the various amendments regarding the two-thirds vote will be discussed again at 4:00 PM this afternoon, and then adjourned the meeting.

New Method to Solve Housing Shortage

Because they had nowhere to live, Mr. and Mrs. Swanson from Oregon, USA, unusually used military aircraft to lift the lighthouse house erected on the wooden stakes on the shore at the intersection of the Columbia and Willamette rivers, moved it to a giant ship, and then transported it to the same wooden stakes on the nearby river bank. From then on, they could live in peace and comfort. According to reports, this house was erected 51 years ago and has been uninhabited for 10 years now. (Above) The situation during the lifting.

### Puppet Emperor of Manchukuo Puyi Decides to be Extradited to Japan for Confrontation; Former Wanping County Magistrate Continues to Testify; Zhang Tingfang Recounts the Atrocities of the Japanese Army in Nanjing

[United Press, Tokyo, 7th] According to a statement today by MacArthur's headquarters: The puppet emperor Puyi will appear in court as a witness during the trial of war criminals. This was proposed to the Soviet Union by the international defense team, but the date has not been revealed. The Soviet Union has agreed to extradite Puyi and four former Kwantung Army and Tanaka generals (names not announced) to Japan to testify in court. Puyi is currently under Soviet custody in Vladivostok and will reside in the Soviet embassy during his stay in Japan, "under continued Soviet supervision."

[Remodeling Agency, Tokyo, 7th] After the International Tribunal opened this morning, the first to be cross-examined by Japanese defense lawyer Lin was former Wanping County Magistrate Wang Lengzhai. (Question) According to the Matsumuro-Qin Dechun Agreement, did the Japanese side request the Chinese army to move on July 26th, and did the Chinese army refuse this request? (Answer) Although the Chinese side hoped for peace, the Japanese side did not fulfill the agreement, and ultimately, hope was lost due to the ultimatum on July 26th. They had no choice but to implement full-scale resistance, with the commander of the 29th Army ordering the recapture of Fengtai. (Question) Based on the testimony of the witnesses, was it not the responsibility of the Chinese side to drag the incident into a major war when the incident could have been resolved through diplomatic negotiations? (Answer) The responsibility lies entirely with the Japanese side. After Wang finished his testimony, Chinese witness Captain Zhang Tingfang, who urgently needed to return to China, testified early. He said: "I was an officer in the Army Medical Department. After Nanjing was occupied by the Japanese army, I remained there to care for the wounded Chinese soldiers. Knowing that the Red Cross emblem was ineffective, we wore civilian clothes and entered refugee camps. On the 6th, we were escorted to Xiaguan in a line a three-quarters of a mile long, with more than 5,000 people. Upon arriving at Xiaguan, we saw about 800 Japanese officers and machine guns firing for four hours. I jumped into the river and escaped, but I was shot in the shoulder from behind. I pretended to be a coolie to avoid detection." Following Captain Zhang, former retired Army General Tada Shun, wearing a kimono, took the witness stand. His testimony stated: From August 1937 to December 1938, he served as Vice Chief of Staff. Shanghai was occupied on November 12, 1937, and Nanjing was occupied on December 13, 1937. The operational plan for the Japanese army's capture of Hankou was planned on October 27, 1938. The plan to occupy Shanghai was established when the Shanghai Incident occurred. The plan to occupy Nanjing was established during the Battle of Songhu. The plan to occupy Hankou was established in June or July 1938. The Battle of August 13th was a hasty plan initiated by the navy to support the army, and everything was unprepared. They had no choice but to transport troops by warship. At that time, the plan had no temporary or permanent nature, but was planned with the goal of achieving peace after occupying Nanjing. After Tada, the manager of Standard Oil of New York in Shanghai, Delan, testified, recounting the atrocities of the Japanese army during the occupation of Hankou.

### France in Vietnam Adopts a Dual Policy

Promoting Friendship on the Surface, Secretly Continuing Ill Will

[Reuters, Paris, 6th] The head of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pointed out that France is adopting a dual policy in Vietnam, appearing to promote friendship while actually undermining it. He also stated that the French-Vietnamese conflict in Bảo Ninh, in which twelve French soldiers were killed and forty-two wounded, was caused by French provocations. The military agreement concerning French troops in Vietnam, which was reached in April, has been repeatedly violated by the French side. France is creating incidents in Vietnam in many ways, and the Bảo Ninh incident is a clear indication of the French side's conspiracy to induce public opinion against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Vietnamese delegation came to France to negotiate the country's status within the French Union.

### Silver Prices Soar in London and New York

[Agence France-Presse, London, 7th] Silver prices have recently soared in London and New York. The new official price in London is 55.5 pence per ounce, an increase of 11.5 pence from the previous price. There are two reasons for the increase. First, the pressure exerted by the American silver group, which has the support of some members of Congress and most silver producers in the United States. Second, the world's demand for silver is extremely urgent. President Truman must yield to the demands of the silver group, or at least has already yielded to a considerable extent. The group proposes increasing the silver price to $1.29 per ounce, and the price of platinum has also risen to $85 per ounce.

### Atomic Energy Commission Held a Meeting Yesterday; Soviet Representative Attacked the United States; Said They Could Not Agree to a Monitoring System

[United Press, New York, 7th] Soviet representative Gromyko today criticized the U.S. plan to control atomic energy, believing that it undermines national sovereignty, and formally declared: the Soviet Union cannot agree to establish a monitoring system. Gromyko told the UN Atomic Energy Commission: the United States asks other countries to trust the goodwill of the United States, but at the same time, the United States doubts the goodwill of other countries. China, the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, and Mexico immediately asked Gromyko: If there is no monitoring system, how can we discover a country that is preparing to use atomic weapons to launch an aggression? Gromyko replied with another question, namely, how can the Security Council discover aggression, regardless of the weapons used? Dutch representative 克·芬斯 (Kè Fēnsī, likely a transliteration) said: He believes that the world should prevent aggression with atomic weapons, and should not be satisfied with merely punishing those who disrupt peace, as proposed in the Soviet plan.

### U.S. Army Drone Breaks Flight Record

[United Press, Muroc, California, 6th] Two U.S. Army B-17 drones departed from Hilo Airport on the island of Hawaii and landed safely at the Army base here today after a non-stop flight of 2,400 miles, setting the longest flight record in aviation history completely without human pilots. Each aircraft was controlled by a mother ship, with one flight lasting 15 hours and the other 15 hours and 40 minutes. The speed at an altitude of 6,500 feet was from 150 to 165 miles per hour. When these drones take off, they are controlled by ground personnel using equipment mounted on jeeps. Once they leave the runway, they are controlled by the mother ship. Landing is also taken over by ground personnel when the aircraft is about 800 feet off the ground. During flight, the mother ship controls the drone from a distance of 200 feet to 3 miles. As the drone approached the California coast, it automatically opened and closed its bomb bay doors, dropping a practice smoke bomb. The bombing operation was also controlled by the mother ship from a distance.

Takeoff, Landing, and Bombing All Controlled by Mother Ship

### A Large Quantity of Military Supplies Confiscated for Aiding the Enemy is Returned! The Original Informant Appeals! One Place Alone Contains Thousands of Tons! How Vast is the Power of Korean Son Chang-shik?

[Report by Our Correspondent] According to what our paper's reporter has learned, a Korean named Son Tian-chang-shik (孫田昌植, changed his name to Son Chang-shik 孫昌植 after the victory) established a large-scale armaments factory in this city during the War of Resistance Against Japan, serving the enemy and puppet forces, and manufacturing sharp military weapons for the Japanese army. After the victory, someone secretly reported this to the Third Front Army, and the factory's materials were confiscated. Later, the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau was established, and the case was transferred to the Bureau by the Third Front Army. At the end of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], the confiscated materials were suddenly returned. The informant was dissatisfied with this handling and recently appealed to the Reception and Investigation Committee. Yesterday, the Investigation Committee specially summoned the appellant to the station, paying close attention to the case. A full account of the details, simply gathered, is as follows: Korean Son Tian-chang-shik has resided in this city for many years. He established a small-scale workshop at the Hardoon Building on Nanjing Road. He was not wealthy and made a living repairing typewriters and cameras. Due to his wife's (Japanese) connections, he became acquainted with Colonel 澀谷 (Shibuya) of the First Naval Supply Department of the Japanese Navy in Shanghai and was assigned to manufacture and repair various military weapons. With Shibuya's help, he obtained a large loan from the enemy Hankou Bank. After obtaining the loan, Son greatly expanded his business, moving the factory to No. 807 North Sichuan Road, under the name "Shanghai Precision Machinery Arts Society." At that time, the enemy was purchasing various hard coins (silver coins, copper coins, aluminum coins, nickel coins, etc.) and various military metal raw materials from our occupied areas, all of which were handled by Son. Also, around the 30th year of the Republic [1941], he accepted an invitation from the enemy Army Department and flew to Nanjing to contract for the repair of all the machines in the Jinling Arsenal (the largest arsenal in the capital, which was seized by the enemy after the occupation). Around September of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], the Japanese military took over the main factory at No. 927 Bubbling Well Road, originally owned by the British merchant Moutrie & Co., and handed it over to Son for use, signing a contract and operating it under the name of military management, specializing in the repair and manufacture of military equipment for the military. Son then changed the address of No. 807 North Sichuan Road to a product showroom and renamed the Moutrie & Co. main factory as "Dai Nippon Military Management Moutrie & Co. Shanghai Precision Machinery Arts Society," specializing in the manufacture and repair of military equipment such as aircraft parts, machine gun parts, flamethrowers, bayonets, bullets, copper pumps, etc., and the repair of small tanks, armored cars, and mortars. Son's closest contact with the Japanese military was with the 登 (Deng) No. 1627 unit, whose military equipment and any projects were entrusted to Son for manufacture. During the 31st year of the Republic [1942], to curry favor with the Japanese invaders, Son presented five fighter planes, for which the then Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo specially issued a letter of gratitude. Due to the support of the Japanese chiefs, the company's business was extensive, employing more than 200 Chinese workers and dozens of Japanese, Korean, Jewish, and White Russian technicians. In the later stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, to cope with Allied bombing, the company had anti-aircraft guns installed on the roof for protection, which nearby residents had witnessed. After the victory, Son immediately closed down the factory and transferred a large amount of military supplies to No. 1350 Seymour Road. This was secretly reported to the Second Section of the Third Front Army, and Director Mao sent personnel to inspect. On October 23rd of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], personnel were sent again, and military hardware and manufactured products amounting to thousands of tons were seized. Important account books were also seized at the Moutrie & Co. office at No. 60 Nanjing Road. A large number of aluminum and copper ingots were also seized at Son's residence on Route Pétain, and 16 barrels of gasoline and more than 100 boxes of auto parts, as well as 45 gold bars (450 taels), were found in a secret basement. After being confiscated by the Third Front Army, they were transferred to the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau. In late December of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau considered the evidence insufficient and returned the confiscated materials to Son Chang-shik. The original informant was dissatisfied and appealed to the Investigation Committee, requesting an investigation into the truth to prevent the enemy arms dealer with war criminal suspicions from escaping.

### Celebrating "Father's Day" Today; Selling Commemorative Flowers for Student Aid; Celebration Ceremony Held Yesterday; Yan Huiqing Elucidates Meaning

[Report by Our Correspondent] On the eve of the August 8th Father's Day, the Shanghai YMCA held a Father's Day celebration at the auditorium between 5:00 PM and 7:00 PM yesterday. More than 200 people attended. Mr. Yan Huiqing also attended, and Pan Gongzhan, suffering from a cold, sent his secretary to represent him.

After the opening music, the assembly sang "Ode to Father"—"Toil, toil, Father's toil, I love my father heart and soul. Lamb kneels for milk, bird feeds back, I love my mother, I love my father; For me, take up hammer and axe, for me, take up bow and crossbow; Thorns and forests plow and hoe, green fields a thousand miles field and garden. Old trees, roots and soil, generations of toil, father and ancestors, drop by drop of sweat, grain by grain of millet, father and ancestors, children and fathers; Wind and rain, worry and toil, children and grandchildren sing and dance; Toil, toil, Father's toil, I love my father heart and soul." The song was written by Fei (費) and composed by Huang Yijun (黃貽鈞), sincere and thought-provoking.

The Meaning of Father

After Chairman Lu Ganchen (陸幹臣) reported on the origins of Father's Day, Yan Huiqing gave a speech. He cited the meaning of the two characters "Father" and spoke of "Heavenly Father" and "National Father," who should receive the highest respect and love. He talked about when he was studying in the United States, the teachers in the school were very concerned about the students, as intimate as family members. Chinese students did not have such good fortune and could only hope that fathers could shoulder their responsibilities. Every father should take some time every day to teach their children, but now most fathers are busy with wine, women, wealth, and temper. "So," he said, "the meaning of Father's Day is twofold. On the one hand, children must learn to love their fathers, and on the other hand, fathers must learn to cultivate themselves, manage their families, and broaden their horizons to teach their children. This is of great benefit to the country and the race."

Cultivation and Enlightenment

Pi Yu (皮禹) then delivered a speech, talking about the meaning and enlightenment of Father's Day. He said: "Father's Day was initiated last year under the enemy puppet oppression before the victory by several loyal and unyielding people, who wore plum blossom-shaped national flowers to imply their nostalgia for their motherland, linking loyalty and filial piety together, and organized donations to help poor students, etc. All of this is the expression of national consciousness, the manifestation of national integrity, and the promotion of national morality. And Father's Day has three points of enlightenment for us: First, because of this War of Resistance Against Japan, we realize clearly that as long as national consciousness exists, the country's future is absolutely hopeful. Secondly, it makes us understand our position in the family and society and the responsibility of inheriting and leading. It is after the commemoration of Father's Day that it can serve as a guideline for our lives, and due to thinking about our father's concern for us, we should be self-conscious and self-disciplined at all times."

After the speeches, the YMCA's "Mandarin Worship Sacred Music Troupe" performed musical programs. A soprano solo "How Can I Not Think of Him" and a tenor solo "Who is Sylvia" both won clear applause.

A Good Father

After reading the Heavenly Father's Ode, Han Wenzao (韓文藻), the organizer of the celebration, stood up to introduce a "good father," Qian Shiyong. Mr. Qian is 58 years old, has five sons and two daughters, and is a director of the Shanghai Northern Baptist Church, running a Yongli Plumbing Engineering Materials store. He is very enthusiastic about public welfare. The YMCA initiated the tea promotion association, and Mr. Qian donated a lot of tea cups and tea sets, and he especially devoted himself to the education of his children. His two sons, Qian Yuanfu and Qian Yuangui, were also invited to the stage. Yuangui took flowers, and Yuanfu reported his father's virtues to the audience. They gave the flowers to their father amid applause, also representing the respect of millions of children for their fathers.

The celebration ended in the echoes of another program by the "Mandarin Worship Sacred Music Troupe," a duet "Duet from Season." Chairman Lu Ganchen finally reported: The Father's Day Promotion Committee and the Shanghai Student Relief Committee will, tomorrow (that is, today), raise commemorative flowers in [missing characters] lively places in the city, and the proceeds will be used entirely to help poor students.

### The High Court Opens Trial for Xiang Kangyuan's Case; Lawyer Claims "Bedridden in Chongqing" and Indicates a Default Judgment is Possible

[Report from Our Newspaper] Xiang Kangyuan, the owner of Kangyuan Canning Factory, was previously reported by employees on suspicion of being a traitor. After investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office, he was formally prosecuted. Xiang himself left Shanghai for elsewhere after the victory. The case was investigated yesterday by the High Court. The defendant's defense lawyers, Chen Tingrui and Huang Jiyuan, attended and claimed to the court that Xiang himself had previously been ill in Chongqing, with a diagnosis and prescription from a local hospital as proof. However, there has been no news for two months. The lawyers pointed out that the defendant has a high reputation in the industrial sector, and the only false position he held was as a member of the Municipal Advisory Committee. If the court urgently needs to close the case, it can issue a default judgment in accordance with Article 298 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The court immediately stated: The case has been delayed for a long time, and the defense lawyers can inform the defendant's family to find a way to notify the defendant to come to the court as soon as possible to settle the case. The matter of a default judgment will be decided by this court. The case is adjourned for further hearing.

### Pan Yangyao Underwent Trial Yesterday, Denying Guilt on All Charges and Requesting an End to Detention, Pending a Ruling on the Application

[Report from Our Newspaper] Pan Yangyao is 54 years old and a native of Jiading. After the victory, the Shanghai office of the Military Statistics Bureau arrested him on suspicion of being a traitor and sent him to the Prosecutor's Office of the High Court for investigation, which filed a public prosecution. The case was heard yesterday afternoon in the High Court by Judge Cao Jun. Pan wore a white silk long gown, gray socks, and black cloth shoes, holding a paper fan. His hair was cut short and was already turning white. After the judge asked about his name, age, and origin, he stated: Before the war, he had been working as a secretary at the Four Banks Joint Savings Society. During the war, he went to the interior several times to investigate industries. Later, he was resented by "No. 76" for this reason, and a shot was fired in front of the Four Banks Joint Savings Society, but fortunately, it did not hit him. Later, he was arrested twice by the Japanese Kempeitai and then fled to Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, he met Zhou Xianggeng, who wanted to establish a Jiyongfeng Bank in Shanghai and invited him to invest. The bank had registered with the Ministry of Industry in Chongqing and obtained a license from the Ministry of Finance. He felt it was legitimate, so he invested 3,000 to 4,000 yuan and was elected as a director. At that time, the total capital was about 500,000 yuan, which had increased to 30 million yuan in puppet currency by the time of the victory. The address was No. 68 Ningbo Road, and it has now been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to be liquidated. The chairman was originally Zhao Zhendong, but he died of illness, so he was allowed to temporarily replace him. The bank was entirely organized by people from the industrial and commercial sectors and had no dealings with the enemy or puppets. All the shareholders totaled more than 1,000 people, and there were no puppet officials in the board of directors or supervisors. At that time, it was a public offering of shares, and he was in Hong Kong, so Wang Yongkang, Xiang Kangyuan, and others joined, which he did not know beforehand. The bank was purely a commercial bank that provided small industrial and commercial loans and did not hoard goods or disrupt finance. As for the articles published, "How to Increase Production" was written because the enemy and puppets had destroyed the national goods factories, and the people's livelihood was difficult, so he loudly appealed for "Self-Reliance and Dignified Survival Requirements," meaning that the Chinese nation, like other nations, should be self-reliant, dignified, independent, and equal. His true intention was to let the Japanese know that the Chinese were not easily deceived. At that time, he took a bold risk because of a passionate heart that could not be suppressed, and only then did he write this article. Now, however, the prosecutor is taking it out of context, and he is being sued for this. The defendant will not admit guilt under any circumstances. Lawyers Jiang Pingfan and Yu Enliang provided defense. Judge Cao then asked Pan if he was a party member. He replied no. He was then asked if he had joined any other party. He replied no. Judge Cao said that this was irrelevant and told him to speak freely. Pan still replied: The defendant is a scholar who only does business and does not hold any political positions. The court then ordered him to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing. Pan immediately requested: The defendant has been detained for nearly half a year, and has been sick with a fever in prison for days. He is forced to appear in court today, can he apply for bail to suspend detention? The court replied that according to legal procedures, he should submit an application and await a ruling. Pan was then escorted back to prison by the bailiffs.

Prosecution of You Jusun and Others

You Jusun, also known as Jianqing, Ling Yangwu, Gu Huting, and others have been investigated by the High Prosecutor's Office and prosecuted on suspicion of being traitors.

### Land Prosecutor's Office Investigates Grain Loan Case, Principal Figure Yang Xizhi Fails to Appear in Court

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yang Xizhi, the principal figure in the grain loan case, was issued a summons by the Land Prosecutor's Office after returning from the United States, ordering him to appear in court for investigation at 9:00 AM yesterday. However, Yang Xizhi did not appear in court yesterday morning. According to the prosecutor in charge of the case, the summons was sent by registered mail several days ago to the Ministry of Food in Nanjing to be forwarded to Yang Xizhi. However, due to the customs of the Chinese officialdom, the transfer was slow and time-consuming. Therefore, whether Yang's failure to appear today was because he had not yet received the notice, the Land Prosecutor's Office is currently investigating the cause. If it is resistance to the summons, the Land Prosecutor's Office will review the situation and consider issuing an arrest warrant.

### Promotion of "Miss Shanghai" Fundraising Tea Party Hosts Contestants; Dance Stars and Singers Enthusiastically Participate; Zhang Xuefeng Competes in the Debutante Group

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Fundraising Committee of the Jiangsu-Northern Refugee Relief Association held a tea party at the Red Cotton Restaurant yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to host the press and contestants from each group of the "Miss Shanghai" election. The tea party was hosted by Wang Xianqing, the general director of the association, and Wu Kaixian, the deputy chairman and director of the Social Affairs Bureau, also attended in person. The most enthusiastic contestants were from the dance star group and the singer group. The dance star group included Guan Minli, Gu Lihua, Zhou Lijuan, and Ye Meimei, who are all popular stars in the dance world. It is also learned that Li Zhen and Li Zhenzhen have also decided to participate, but were unable to attend due to other commitments. The singer group included Zhang Yiwen, Lang Yin, Zheng Yun, Li Rong, Bai Yun, and Dong Peipei, totaling six people. Only Yuan Xuefen and Shi Yinhua from the Yue Opera group attended; the rest did not attend.

At the tea party, Wang Xianqing first reported the "Significance of Electing Miss Shanghai," stating that it was not a frivolous act and that the motivation was only to help disaster victims with the spirit of human mutual aid. Then, Director Wu delivered a speech, briefly stating that the fundraising target for this time is 2 billion yuan. In addition to the 1.5 billion yuan that has been separately identified by the industrial and financial sectors, raising the remaining amount is quite difficult. Therefore, this election was launched in the hope of mobilizing all the citizens of Shanghai to work together to help 3 million refugees. Director Wu also repeatedly stated that the election is purely for disaster relief and not a frivolous act, and he hoped that all sectors would enthusiastically support it. Suddenly, Lu Jinrong, the chairman of the Radio Industry Association, stood up and asked Yuan Xuefen from the Yue Opera group to speak. Yuan immediately expressed that she was willing to fulfill other obligations but did not intend to participate in the election. Lu stood up again to supplement Yuan's statement, saying that the Yue Opera group did not want to participate because "people's words are terrible." He also hoped that the press would "show mercy in writing" in the future. Wang Xianqing immediately stated that Yuan's opinion only represented her personally. Director Wu also thought that Lu's words were close to being inappropriate, so he stood up and spoke again, expressing his deep gratitude for the enthusiastic assistance of the press and said that the phrase "people's words are terrible" should be changed to "people's words are lovely." In this way, it can be more sincere and friendly, and the goal of raising funds for disaster relief can be easily achieved. After the meeting, it was learned that another person, Miss Zhang Xuefeng, had joined the debutante group. Zhang is from Shaoxing, 19 years old, and a high-achieving student at Xiaoming Girls' High School. Therefore, including Miss Gao Qingyi, who was the first to sign up, there are now two people. It is also heard that there are still six people in the process of completing registration procedures.

### Chongxin Yarn Factory Robbery Case Solved; Gangsters Panic and Leave Behind a Briefcase, Finding Clues; Nine Major Criminals Arrested One After Another

[Report from Our Newspaper] The huge 20 million yuan robbery that occurred at the Chongxin Yarn Factory at No. 1 Xiguangfu Road, Zhabei, at 10:00 AM on the 27th of last month involved more than ten gangsters, each carrying rapid-fire and slow-fire machine guns and all with rich experience in street fighting. Therefore, although the factory requested police assistance and patrolman Xu Senfu and others from the Zhi Ren Village Substation opened fire, the gangsters were equally unwilling to show weakness and returned fire to resist arrest. The two sides held out for as long as 25 minutes, and finally the gangsters escaped with the money while fighting and retreating. Along the way, they hijacked passing trucks twice. All the details were recorded in this newspaper on the 28th. It has now been reported that all the major principal offenders and accomplices have been arrested one after another, except for six who were arrested and hidden in this city, the rest were captured by tracking them to Suzhou and Jiaxing and other places. The following is a record of the investigation and solution of the case:

Detectives Dispatched as Far as Suzhou and Jiaxing

It was found that after the gangsters hijacked the first vehicle that day, one of the gangsters fell off the vehicle due to the vehicle traveling too fast on Zhongshan Road, causing a serious head injury. The remaining gangsters then hijacked another ten-ton truck, ordered the driver to get out of the vehicle, and helped the gangster into the vehicle to continue moving forward. However, in this hasty time, the gangsters left behind a briefcase, which was immediately seized by the Putuo Road Sub-bureau. A Suzhou epidemic prevention certificate was found inside, with the name Li Zaiyang. Therefore, based on this clue, an investigation was launched, and it was learned that Li Zaiyang is currently the Deputy Captain of the Fourth Brigade of the Minhang Jiangsu Water Police Headquarters. On July 11, he asked Su Jin, the Captain of the Headquarters, for a week's leave to purchase military sugar and uniforms for the team. After being approved for four days, Li disappeared without a trace. The police then dispatched officers to Songjiang and Suzhou based on the investigation report (because Li had once served as a major captain in Songjiang). They were arrested at the residence of his sister, Li Suying, at No. 15 Tongdeli, Qianjie, Suzhou County. According to her, Li did not come to Suzhou. After searching his home, a letter was found under a wooden box, with the address Jiang Jingbo, No. 48 Chaicao Chang, Jiaxing. At this time, the police had learned that Li's wife's name was Jiang Jingbo, and the traces of inspection were still fresh, so it was determined that Jiang had undoubtedly fled to Jiaxing.

Boat Girl Arrested in Small Village

At that time, Li Suying was first escorted to Shanghai, and another team continued to go to No. 46 Chaicao Chang, Jiaxing, to investigate. The place was a slum with many residents. Although inquiries were made, no one knew Jiang Jingbo. Later, the police officers informed them of her appearance and characteristics, etc., and they learned that she was the boat girl who was very popular in Nanhu two years ago and had recently returned here from Shanghai. She is currently living in a small village about three miles away. The police officers went to the address and found Jiang and another man nicknamed Little Dongyang, Yang Fengxiang, sitting together and talking and laughing. Seeing the police officers arrive suddenly, they surrendered. However, she firmly refused to reveal her husband's whereabouts, only admitting that her husband had indeed shared 6.1 million yuan in stolen money with Xia Kun and Little Dongyang during the robbery.

Six More Captured in Shanghai

At that time, the Shanghai side also received reports from informants starting on the 29th and first captured Zhao Xiaolaohan, a key criminal in the case, 27 years old, from Jiangbei. After the gangster divided 1.25 million yuan in stolen money, he still set up a pancake stall at No. 270 Longqingli, Xikang Road, to avoid attracting attention. According to his confession, the accomplices Li Wangen (also known as Little * Zi) and * * Chuan were re-* * obtained, and two rapid-fire machines, one revolver, and thirty rounds of bullets were seized from Bian's residence (No. 160 Zhangjiazhai, Qimei Road). After * interrogation, he confessed that the case was initiated by his brother Jinlong and Xia Kun, Li Zai * and others. However, his brother was injured on the day of * the accident and has now left Shanghai to go to Suzhou for treatment. At the same time, the Putuo Road Sub-bureau also arrested an accomplice, * Qilin (also known as Qilin), and learned that the main offender Xia Jinlong had not left Shanghai. The Changning Road Sub-bureau then sent officers to investigate in four directions and arrested him at the Jiaxing Road Bridge in Yokohama on the 30th. Bian had hired a small boat, intending to escape to Suzhou via the Yokohama, Pujiang, and Suzhou Rivers to Suzhou for treatment. The boat fee was 50,000 yuan. However, when he was arrested, Bian's injuries were very serious, so the police station immediately sent him to the police hospital for treatment. After strict interrogation, another main offender, Xia Kun, was arrested at No. 63 Kangjiaqiao. At this point, all the criminals in the case, except for Li Zaiyang who was at large, had almost all been arrested. It is heard that all the pre-arranged arrangements for this robbery were planned by Xia Kun, who claimed to be a "staff officer," and Bian Jinlong was injured "on duty," so 2.1 million yuan was specifically set aside from the stolen money as treatment expenses.

### Shanghai Middle School Training Session Holds Opening Ceremony Yesterday

Hua Luogeng and Others Will Lecture Today

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Education Bureau's summer training session for middle school teachers held its opening ceremony at 9:00 AM yesterday, in the second floor of the central building of Jiaotong University. Deputy Director Li Ximou, Section Chief Chen Xuanshan, Section Chief Xie Engao, Commissioner Wang Dagang, Inspector Ma Jingxuan, personnel in charge of the session, and teachers from various schools, totaling over a hundred people, attended. Deputy Director Li presided over the ceremony.

Li Ximou's Speech

After the ceremonial greetings, Deputy Director Li gave a speech, stating that in the summer of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the four major universities in Shanghai jointly organized a summer training session for middle school teachers with the Municipal Education Bureau, and the number of middle school teachers participating was very enthusiastic. He also mentioned that in the summer schools of various European and American universities, there are middle school teacher refresher courses. The weather is really too hot, Deputy Director Li said, waving a paper fan. Our training session is also held to promote your further studies and improve the effectiveness of middle school education. This time, thanks to the help of Jiaotong University, the entire equipment of the library, physics laboratory, and chemistry laboratory is provided for our reference and practice. The lecturers of each subject are all nationally and globally renowned university professors, and we should express our satisfaction and gratitude. Finally, Deputy Director Li hoped that during the two weeks of the training session, everyone will use the new knowledge gained and the spirit of experimentation to jointly seek the improvement of middle school education in the city.

Chen Xuanshan's Speech

Following, Section Chief Chen Xuanshan gave a speech, stating that after the victory, newly published books and magazines in Shanghai, such as foreign original magazines and publications from the mainland, were sold out as soon as they arrived in Shanghai. This is a phenomenon of Shanghai people's intellectual famine, that is, Shanghai people's knowledge lags behind. This time, we are holding a middle school teacher training session to make up for this deficiency. Section Chief Chen also said that in a report by the League of Nations education inspection team ten years ago, there was a saying that our country's education is greatly influenced by American education, that is, it only pays attention to the discussion of teaching methods, and ignores the research of teaching material content. In fact, teaching methods are also very important. Few people in our country's middle school subjects conduct experimental research on teaching methods. This session pays great attention to this point, and hires lecturers to deliberate extensively, so that the research of teaching materials and the discussion of teaching methods are equally emphasized.

Wang Dagang's Speech

Finally, Commissioner Wang Dagang reported on academic affairs and the preparation process, and said that he had received letters from middle school teachers in Suzhou and Wuxi requesting to join the lectures, but because the session did not have accommodation, he had to decline. Commissioner Wang also said that the location of the session is extremely convenient for transportation. Five bus routes stop at the entrance of Jiaotong University, and one tram station is a short walk away. In addition, Jiaotong University is full of trees and the grass is flat. The cool breeze makes one forget the sultry heat. We are both avoiding the heat and studying, as if we are in a fairyland. I hope everyone will pass this message to their colleagues and participate enthusiastically. The session is very welcome. Also, it is reported that the session will officially begin today, and lecturers Jiang Zhuzhuang, Hua Luogeng, Qian Zhongqing, etc., will all attend the session on the first day to lecture.

After fifty minutes, the fire was extinguished. The class returned to the class with songs of victory. Nearby residents applauded sincerely and happily along the way to express their gratitude. The deputy education directors of the class, Fan Sixu and Zhou Jishan, and the two captains, Li Jiguang and Liu Zuxin, deeply felt that all the members could participate in the firefighting with courage, sincere emotions, and fast and accurate technology during the learning process, demonstrating the greatest kindness of human beings.

### Q&A on Household Registration Regulations (Continued)

(31) Question: For the exercise of rights and the performance of obligations, should the place of original residence or the place of current residence be the standard?

Answer: The provision for current residence is to alleviate the deficiencies of original residence. If one already resides in the place of current residence, one should exercise rights and fulfill obligations in the place of current residence. However, if the laws and regulations governing the conferral of such rights and obligations stipulate otherwise, then those regulations shall prevail.

(32) Question: Should those sentenced to life imprisonment be included in the household registration?

Answer: Yes, they should still be included in the household registration, with detailed notes in the remarks column.

(33) Question: How should households fleeing from famine, which are of a short-term departure nature, be handled during the investigation?

Answer: When encountering such situations during the investigation, the household number should be reserved and temporarily not included in the household registration register.

(34) Question: When several households of foreign church members and several households of civil servants reside in a church, how should the household registration be compiled?

Answer: They should be compiled separately according to foreign households and ordinary households.

(35) Question: The household registration book takes the area under the jurisdiction of the household registration as a unit, and its numbering is arranged sequentially in chronological order. In this case, the order of the wards and sub-wards is not very neat, and inspection and statistics are also inconvenient. How should this be remedied?

Answer: A loose-leaf household registration book can be added, the content items and numbering of which are the same as the household registration book. After the initial household registration, if there is establishment of household registration, transfer of household registration, or removal of household registration, in addition to making changes in the relevant books, it can be added to or extracted from this loose-leaf household registration book at any time according to the order of the wards and sub-wards. Its compilation method is also compiled and bound according to the order of the wards and sub-wards, so as to facilitate inspection and registration, and benefit statistics.

(36) Question: Regarding the registration of permanent and temporary residents, if there are people from other provinces or counties who have lived in this county or city for several generations, or decades, or have lived for less than three years, and the male has no original residence, how should it be handled?

Answer: They should be ordered to apply for registration as having original residence. If they do not wish to register as having original residence, but wish to register as having current residence, it may be temporarily approved. However, after the household registration is processed in the province, county, or city of their original residence, the household should submit a registration with original residence to reduce the number of current residents without original residence and comply with the provisions of Article 4, Item 1 of the Household Registration Law.

(37) Question: If someone has one wife and two concubines living in three places, and household registration is processed in three places at the same time, how should the head of the household be filled out? How can duplication be avoided when compiling statistics?

Answer: Registration should be done in all three places. For the same head of the household, except for the current place of residence, if it is not the current place of residence, or a place where the accommodation time is shorter, the remarks column of the form should indicate where the head of the household goes, what position he holds, and whether he has a fixed residence or domicile, and indicate that when compiling statistics, the household should be counted in the current place of residence.

(38) Question: If the distance between migrations between wards is very far, can the order of the household registration book be changed accordingly?

Answer: In order to take into account the order of the households in the wards and sub-wards and the order of the household registration sea, the order after the migration can be temporarily arranged.

(39) Question: The household registration book stipulates that each book has one hundred pages, and each page is numbered. If a household registration matter occurs after one-time registration, how should it be added?

Answer: Now that household registration and personal registration take the township and town of the county and the district of the city as their jurisdiction, and should be numbered by ward, and the number of households in each ward should be filled in sequentially from No. 1 in the blank space of the number column "No." on the first paper of each household. When a new household applies for registration, it should still be connected and filled in, the purpose of which is to record the number of households, and each ward is the beginning and end. As for Article 6 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Amended Household Registration Law, which stipulates that the number compiled by the county and city governments or the establishment bureaus refers to the number of pages, it should be filled in the blank space of the two words "page" at the end of the registration book, the purpose of which is to record the number of pages, and each book is the beginning and end. The household number and the page number are very different, one is at the beginning of the paper, one is at the end of the paper, one is compiled by the township district according to the ward, and one is compiled by the county and city bureau according to the book.

### The Significance of Father's Day in Education

— Yang Chunlu

Today marks only the second celebration of Father's Day! Although its history is so short, its significance is profound; especially its value in education, which is even more significant!

Every year in May, on the second Sunday, we enthusiastically celebrate "Mother's Day". It was initiated by an American woman who lost her mother at a young age in 1907, and it has now become an international Mother's Day. However, since ancient times, our country has valued filial piety, emphasizing both parents. The ancients said, "Father gave me life, and mother nurtured me." Now that there is a Mother's Day, how can there not be a day to commemorate fathers? Therefore, last year, during the most intense period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when victory was about to arrive, Yan Huiqing and others initiated the establishment of Father's Day on August 8th, taking the "eight eight" as a homophone for "father", making it easy to remember. This year, when the second Father's Day was held, Pan Gongzhan and others requested the central government to issue a clear decree to make it a national commemorative day. At the same time, the Father's Day Promotion Committee sent letters to the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and other countries, jointly advocating its promotion, and it will soon become an international Father's Day.

Filial piety is originally an inherent virtue in our country, and it is also an important training in modern education. The youth code has the provision of "filial piety", and the central training also has the implementation of "filial piety week". Now that the advocacy of Father's Day has emerged, it can strengthen this training and achieve the purpose of education. Moreover, the meaning of filial piety is not limited to serving parents, supporting them physically, and following their wishes; if children cannot cultivate their character, study diligently, and strive to improve, they will fail to live up to the parents' hard work in raising them, and cannot be considered to have fully fulfilled their filial piety. Therefore, the promotion of Father's Day directly and indirectly increases educational efficiency.

The most important responsibility of a father is to educate his children, making them a sound and independent person. The ancients said, "Raising without teaching is the father's fault." The advocacy of Father's Day is enough to urge the general fathers to pay attention to their responsibilities, so as to avoid children from dropping out of school. National education will be universal without being universalized. Recently, the Father's Day Promotion Committee has been actively raising scholarships in order to reduce the burden on fathers and relieve out-of-school children. It is hoped that this meaningful movement can be universally launched and achieve great results, which is also a major contribution of this Father's Day to education.

### The Issues of the Industrial and Commercial Petition Delegation: Tightening Credit... Insufficient Momentum, Declining Production... Closures in Succession

[This Newspaper Report] Due to the increasingly serious industrial and commercial crisis, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Branch of the National Industrial Association have appointed representatives to travel to Nanjing by night train today to suggest rescue methods to the authorities and urge their implementation. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce specially invited leaders of various major industries to see off the delegation at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 4:00 PM today. All parties attach great importance to this. According to opinions expressed by related parties, the number of factory shutdowns and store closures has been increasing day by day. Not only is industry on the verge of collapse, but commerce is also difficult to sustain. For example, in the silk, cotton cloth, and cotton yarn industries, dozens of companies have been closing down every day in the past ten days. Therefore, this petition is a last resort. According to those familiar with the financial market, after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan last year, when the government resumed operations, the interest rate was around 8% per month. Afterwards, it gradually increased, reaching as high as 24-25% in May and June of this year, eventually leading to the turmoil at the end of June. Recently, it has fallen again, generally between 12-13%. However, the condition of industry and commerce has become even more sluggish. According to common observation, during the period of high interest rates in May and June, industry and commerce were actually drinking poison to quench their thirst, and their operating profits could not possibly bear this burden.

High Interest Rates Suppress, Daring Not Borrow

When the common interest rates suppressed and the vitality was exhausted, they realized that borrowing was not a solution after all. Stable people would rather close their doors than take on more debt. The out-of-town merchants in Shanghai also prepaid their funds for purchasing goods, because the actual sales in the inland areas were scarce. As a result, business became clearer and clearer, and no one dared to eat the dismantling interest. The situation was precarious. Those who did not hesitate to eat out-of-town funds at high interest rates to survive, the lenders did not dare to act. Therefore, on the surface, interest rates were reduced, but the funds of industry and commerce became tighter and tighter. According to news from the yarn and cloth industries, the Shanghai Zhuang established by various out-of-town merchants

Actual Sales Sluggish, Shanghai Zhuang Arbitrage Interest

Recently, they have indeed been doing things by scraping interest. Their method is to first deposit funds in the factory number and ask for interest, and the factory number will be forced to comply, because it covets its future business. When they receive a telegram to purchase goods, they will wait until the shipping date, and then talk about the payment period for five days or ten days, in order to wait for the dismantling interest funds they have released to be able to extend the date. The reason is ultimately due to the sluggish business, and the factory number is caused by accommodation. An authoritative source in the industrial sector revealed that the current monetary policy is loose on the surface but tight in reality, and the factory's production rate,

The Production Rate of Important Production Has Fallen Sharply

On average, it has fallen to 30-40%. Among them, the situation of silk weaving, knitting, handkerchief weaving, dyeing and weaving, wool textile, silk reeling industry, chemical industry, and machinery industry is even worse. The cigarette industry, which is known as the golden industry, is now losing money in every household. The electrical appliance and cosmetics industries have turned from profit to loss, making it even more difficult to stand. Factories in matches, paper making, and pharmaceuticals are superficially maintaining, but the cost is increasing day by day and the selling price is decreasing, making it difficult to continue. Yarn mills are called the darlings of heaven, but everyone pays attention to them, and the exploitation is above all industries. People in the industry are deeply afraid that good times will not last long and are not without burnout. Therefore, from the overall observation of the industrial sector, the loose monetary policy on the surface but tight in reality only increases the strike on factories. Moreover, there is no definite policy for international trade, and the worker's living index only hears the news of rising prices. The situation of collapse has already arrived.

Insufficient Power, Difficult to Relocate

The power generation equipment of the municipal power company lost one-third during the war. The Pudong and Nanshi electric companies have not been able to generate electricity until now. Although the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company has recently made various efforts, it can generate a part of the electricity, but compared with before the war, it is only one-fifth. According to the statistics of the Shanghai Power Company, the power consumption of various major industries is currently less than 30% of that before the war. The weakness of the operating rate of factories in the city can be generally seen. Some factories borrowed the concessions as shelters during the war. Now they plan to rebuild the factory buildings on the ruins of the suburbs, as a step for future development. However, Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong are now unable to add new power lines. This is a great obstacle to the future industrial revival. According to those close to the competent authority.

Revising Tariffs, Not Without Restraints

The International Trade Conference will be held in London in October, and all countries advocate the removal of tariff barriers and other trade barriers. Although the central government has a proposal to revise import and export tariffs, the protective meaning is still limited. Various industrial associations will express their opinions on this issue. The petition delegation revealed that this trip will make concise and emergency requests, and the industrial crisis will be especially concerned. All the above situations are being planned to be dealt with.

### Gold and Paper Money Both Retracted Slightly

British exchange was 8,880 yuan with supply, and there was no transaction. US exchange was nominally flat but actually sluggish.

### Chinese Stocks Turned to Sideways Trading at High Levels, Foreign Stocks Still Had No Improvement

Chinese stocks saw sideways trading at high levels and continued to inch up, but the buying momentum was weak. It was still hovering at the close. Yongsha first saw a high price of 715 yuan, Meiya 4,200 yuan, Jingfu 245 yuan, Xinguang 250 yuan, and Qinxing 187 yuan. In the morning, Yongsha fell to 690 yuan, Meiya 3,950 yuan, Jingfu 230 yuan, Xinguang 232 yuan, and Qinxing 168 yuan. Each of the less popular small and medium-sized stocks first firmed and then retreated. The result was still stable. Large investors still entered and exited abruptly and inconsistently. Compared with the previous close, Yongsha rose by 13 yuan, Meiya was better by 170 yuan, and the three small stocks such as Jingfu were not as good. Compared with the previous examination, the less popular small and medium-sized stocks and veteran stocks all made slight progress.

Foreign stocks were still idle and there was not much trading. The price was also difficult to improve. Except for Yisha, which had a small number of transactions, the rest were all indicative prices. Yisha first saw a low price of 8,100 yuan and rebounded slightly at the close. Compared with the previous close, Yisha, British Alliance, and Deying all fell slightly, the paper industry rose slightly, and the rest were flat and unchanged.

Decline in the Bond Market

Public bonds were still difficult to become active. Only a few hundred thousand were traded. Tong Bing first rose and then became tired, falling from 700 yuan to 670 yuan, with only 30 yuan of fluctuations. Tong Wu had a slight rebound yesterday, which was more intense than the previous day's advance. Compared with the previous close, Jia, Yi, and Bing were all flat, Tong Ding fell slightly by 10 yuan, and Tong Wu retracted slightly by 20 yuan.

### Artificial Silk Continued to Rise

Yesterday, rayon saw another high price. On the 120th Tianqiao, some buyers made 1.5 million yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, the bulls bought up, making 520,000 yuan, which was 20,000 yuan better than the previous day. The miscellaneous 120th also brought up 120,000 yuan. The rest of the semi-gloss and 150th gloss were all called for the original disk of the previous day, and there was no transaction. Factory-managed silk goods were all hovering on the tired road, and the transaction was light and difficult to improve. Huajin crepe had sales from out-of-town merchants, but they were unwilling to bid. There were many holders, and all kinds of people accommodated the transaction, so the selling price was not good.

### The Issue of Spring Import Cotton: Estimated World Cotton Production

According to cotton industry authorities, the American cotton stored in the private textile mills in the city can cope until February next year. Regarding the American cotton needed after that, it is rumored that recently, foreign foreign firms have been ordered to order it, and the total number has reached more than 100,000 bales, which can be shipped in January and February next year. At that time, if the foreign exchange application is not approved, it is planned to settle the exchange with US dollars. However, since the Central Bank announced that all designated foreign exchange banks should not pay for domestic transactions and rents in foreign currencies and that imports of cotton without approval should not be sold with foreign exchange, the contract for the recent order of 100,000 bales of American cotton by private textile mills from foreign foreign firms will have problems.

This measure of the bank is very beneficial to the production and sales of domestic cotton, and it is especially helpful to the cotton industry in the city. Afterwards, various manufacturers will have to purchase domestic cotton, and the price of domestic cotton can also be increased. According to the prediction of the Cotton Production Improvement Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the output of domestic cotton next year can reach 10 million dans, but according to the current needs of textile factories nationwide, 8 million dans can cope.

American Cotton's Supply Cannot Meet Demand: The New Cotton Price Reached 40 Cents

The cotton production of various countries in the world is ranked first by the United States, second by India, and third by China. However, the production of the Soviet Union in recent years has also been quite impressive, but the figures have not yet been published. According to a recent private estimate in the United States, the harvest of new cotton this year can be 9,445,500 to 9,768,800 bales. According to the estimation of 45 brokers of the American Cotton Exchange, the harvest of this new cotton is roughly 9,564,000 bales. Because the purchase of American cotton from various countries is quite strong, the Washington Export Bank has asked the government to increase the loan to 400 million US dollars for shipment to Australia and Portugal. Spain has also recently established a 200 million yuan silver pass to prepare for the purchase of American cotton. India has recently restricted exports, and American cotton is almost in a situation where supply cannot meet demand. The price is also gradually increasing. It is rumored that the price of new cotton, American farmers have insisted that it is 40 cents per pound.

### Although the Market Received Goods, Rice Prices Still Rebounded

Yesterday, the northern and southern markets received over 6,000 *shi* of rice. The market had been sluggish, and production areas were in dire straits. Shipping new *xian* and *jing* rice resulted in losses. As a result, arrivals were scarce, and shops took advantage to manipulate prices slightly. The market uniformly rose by one or two thousand *yuan*. The southern market was particularly brisk. If arrivals remain scarce, prices may continue to rise. Flour sales were lackluster, and the market remained sluggish. Wheat bran was stable. Quanzhou, Xinghua, Shantou, and Xiamen all purchased wheat. Qingdao continued to select white wheat. The Ningbo market wasn't a big buyer and supply and demand remained stable. High-grade wheat rose by two to three hundred *yuan*, while medium and lower grades remained steady. The supply of new soybeans continued, but sales were sluggish, causing a further drop of over a thousand *yuan*. Old soybeans fell slightly by four to five hundred *yuan*. After a sharp drop, arrivals of raw peanuts became scarce, and the market rebounded, rising by two to three thousand *yuan*. Oil shops were still eager to purchase. Summer consumption was high. Arrivals of oil from Qingdao were not strong. The demand for raw oil still exceeded supply, and prices rose by one to two thousand *yuan*. Soybean oil also rose by five to six hundred *yuan*, but rapeseed oil remained stable. Sales pressure increased at the close of the market, showing signs of decline. Sesame oil was stable.

### The Yarn Market is Listless; Spot Cotton Sales are Brisk, and Prices are Rising

Yesterday, the yarn market saw mixed fortunes. Spot prices for Shuang Ma yarn inquired after by the South China merchants rose by about 20,000 *yuan*.

Market prices rose again by one to two thousand *yuan*.

The situation for grey fabrics remained stable and trending tighter, as spot goods were scarce and dyeing factories absorbed supply from time to time. The market became stronger. However, broadcloth exhibited signs of fatigue due to ample supply from Fangjian.

### Vegetable Prices Have Risen Sharply in Recent Days; The City Government Will Seek to Curb Them

In recent days, the market prices of various vegetables transported from the surrounding countryside have risen by more than double compared to normal market prices. After an investigation by the authorities, there are indications that vegetable vendors are taking advantage of the situation to raise prices. Therefore, the city government has notified the Municipal Vegetable Industry Association to send all directors and supervisors to a meeting at the city government at 2:00 PM today to inquire about the reasons for the price increase and discuss effective ways to suppress it.

### Sales of Old Tea for Export Are Quite Brisk

Internal sales of red and green tea continue. As for the foreign tea market, export merchants continue to purchase old tea. Jardine Matheson purchased 324 boxes of old Shang Qimen tea from the Anhui Tea Company at a price of 140,000 *yuan* per *dan*. Due to the scarcity of goods, the market price was much higher than the previous day. Other varieties were generally stable.

### U.S. Petroleum Exports Could Reach 400,000 Barrels Per Day

[Reuters, Denver, July 7th] According to a report by Mr. Panqi, director of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, to the American Petroleum Institute, current U.S. oil exports are 350,000 barrels per day. This will increase to a peak of 400,000 barrels per day by 1948, after which it will gradually decrease to about 180,000 barrels per day by 1950. However, domestic consumption of major petroleum products will increase sharply that year.

### Chemical Raw Materials Continue to Fall

Chemical raw materials continue to fall due to high arrivals and weak sales. According to a certain factory, due to various factors, finished products cannot be exported. In addition, the hot weather has caused factories to shut down, so there is no demand for raw materials, resulting in a sharp decline.

### Sugar Merchants are also Allowed to Apply; The Ninth Period of Sugar Allocation Closes Tomorrow; Prices are the Same as Last Period; Supervision Will Be Increased

[Our Newspaper Report] In order to suppress sugar prices so that the general public can buy sugar at affordable prices, the Social Affairs Bureau consulted with the Taiwan Sugar Corporation to directly allocate Taiwan medium-grade sugar starting from the seventh period. However, the general public still did not benefit. It is said that unscrupulous merchants engaged in back door deals with the allocated low-priced sugar, making huge profits in a single transaction, which is regrettable. The ninth period of sugar allocation began accepting applications yesterday and will close tomorrow. It is said that the allocation method has been changed, so that in addition to members of the South Goods and Tea Food Industry Association, members of the Sugar Merchants Association will also be included, in order to be more widespread than before. The allocation price will be the same as the eighth period.

Yesterday, this reporter asked Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau about the fact that ordinary citizens cannot buy sugar at affordable prices, asking whether the bureau would take effective measures to address this. He replied that so far, no concrete evidence of complaints has been received, so the matter is still under investigation. However, it is reported that starting with the ninth period of sugar allocation, the Social Affairs Bureau, in order to strengthen the monitoring of the sales situation of each allocated South Goods store, will consult with various veterans' youth corps for cooperation. At that time, a youth corps member will be stationed in front of each store to monitor and prevent abuses. At the same time, if citizens discover that any of the allocated South Goods stores refuse to sell sugar, they are encouraged to report the facts to the Social Affairs Bureau or the Taiwan Sugar Corporation for investigation and punishment.

Furthermore, in order to clarify the process of allocating affordable sugar in this city during the seventh and eighth periods by Taiwan Sugar Corporation, this reporter visited the person in charge of the company yesterday. He reported that the process of allocating sugar during the seventh and eighth periods was as follows: The seventh period of sugar allocation was approved by the Social Affairs Bureau on July 26. On July 27, the South Goods and Tea Food Industry Associations paid Taiwan Sugar Corporation. Shipments began on July 29 and were cleared on July 31. On August 1, Taiwan Sugar Corporation publicly announced the addresses and purchase quantities of each merchant. A total of 11,766 bags were allocated, and the allocated price was 74,000 *yuan* per 100 *shi jin*. The price for whole bags was 81,000 *yuan* per 100 *shi jin*, and the retail price was 860 *yuan* per *shi jin*. A total of 15,378 bags were allocated in the eighth period, with an allocated price of 70,000 *yuan* per 100 *shi jin*. The price for whole bags was 77,000 *yuan* per 100 *shi jin*, and the retail price was 820 *yuan* per *shi jin*. The allocation was approved by the Social Affairs Bureau on August 2, payments were made on August 3, shipments began on August 5, and all shipments were completed on August 7.

Southern Goods Industry Asks to Increase Profits

Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, the South Goods industry of this city hosted the press at the Atlantic Restaurant. Yu Rupin, the chairman of the association, reported on the allocation of sugar, saying that although the allocated sugar could yield a profit of about 10,000 *yuan* per *dan* based on cost, the actual losses from transportation, storage rent, taxes, packaging, weight differences, weighing, and retail breakdown amounted to 14,000 to 15,000 *yuan*. Therefore, selling at the limited price would not only deprive the industry of profits but also cause significant losses. Therefore, the association, in order to consider the hardships of members' losses, plans to ask the authorities to pay attention to the legal profits that should be obtained.

### Publishing and Air Mail

— Words of Warning

It is not easy to publish a periodical now. Ordinary periodicals, apart from popular square weekly newspapers, are difficult to maintain economically, because the maintenance of periodicals depends on sales, and most current sales are limited by region. For example, periodicals published in Shanghai can now only be sold in Shanghai, or at most along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. Other places cannot be sold due to transportation obstacles. According to the estimation of people with general distribution experience, if a periodical can sell 1,000 copies in Shanghai, it can sell 4,000 to 5,000 copies nationwide. If a publication can't be maintained by relying solely on sales in Shanghai, it can be maintained by relying on the whole country. Here, we can see very clearly that air mail has a major mission for promoting periodicals and spreading culture.

Recently, a person who signed himself "A Distressed Publisher" sent a letter to the editor of the publishing world, saying: "Believe it or not, it has been almost a year since the victory, but what is puzzling is the strict restrictions of the Shanghai Postal Administration on airmailing books and periodicals. According to the post office's regulations, only ordinary letters, daily newspapers, and weekly periodicals can be sent by air from Shanghai. All other books and periodicals, regardless of size, thickness, or importance, regardless of where they are sent, cannot be sent by air." Although the distributor cannot send the distributed periodicals to other places by air mail due to the post office's regulations, in fact, the periodical is quickly being sold in bookstores or newsstands in other places. This seems to prove that airmail is not absolutely impossible.

Therefore, for the sake of protecting my country's fragile publishing industry, I sincerely request two things from the postal authorities. First, please investigate whether there is any "smuggling" of periodicals by airmail. If there is, please strictly prevent it, "turning private into public," and openly accept the airmailing of periodicals. If there are not enough aviation tools, a suitable limit can be imposed on the quantity. Second, if there is no "smuggling," can the postal authorities consider relaxing the limits on the airmailing of various publications, because spreading the seeds of culture is also a work worth undertaking on the postal front.

### China and the Post-War World

— Traditional First

Author: Sun Ke

Publisher: Commercial Press

Date: June, Year 35, Shanghai Edition

Pages: 170

Books on the issue of China's future can often be seen in bookstores lately. We think this is a gratifying phenomenon. What kind of China do we hope to succeed in after the war? This is a question that every Chinese person should ask. We cannot let this country evolve naturally in fact. We should also have theoretical research. This research can make everyone have a clear understanding of the future of the country. Mr. Sun Zhe-sheng, as a practical politician, makes a theoretical review of China's future, integrating his experience and theory, which is really commendable. We have recently read three of his works: (1) China's Future; (2) China and the Post-War World; (3) The Three Principles of the People and New China. These three books are all published by Commercial Press. They include Mr. Zhe-sheng's papers and speeches on the issue of China's future in recent years. "China's Future" has twenty-two articles, with two appendices. At the end of the book, there is a postscript by Mr. Wu Jingtai, which is closely related to Mr. Zhe-sheng's philosophy of life. "China and the Post-War World" has seventeen articles, with a postscript by Mr. Situ De at the end. "The Three Principles of the People and New China" also has seventeen articles, with three appendices: (1) The National Government's Outline for National Construction, (2) The Draft Constitution of the Republic of China, and (3) The Principles of the First Phase of Economic Construction.

In Sun Guang-sheng's lectures, we cannot find emotional propaganda or abstract and empty slogans. He studies problems with the demeanor of a scholar. There are places where he defends his doctrine, but there is also serious self-criticism. For example, he said: "Now, after our review, we feel that in many places in the Premier's teachings, we have not done well. Because we have not done well, the difficulties of our country are increasing day by day, and the construction of the country is not easy to complete." He also said: "In the past, our party and government often had very good resolutions, but when they were issued, they could not be promoted after reaching the middle level. The middle and lower levels are irresponsible and cannot implement the execution of orders. Their work is all written reports. If things don't work, they stop or simply don't do them and put them aside. When the above urges or the deadline is up, they make a screen report… The central government relies on the provinces, the provinces rely on the counties, and layer by layer down, no one examines and corrects their mistakes. Everything is wrong on top of wrong, and the result is that politics makes no progress at all." These are all sharp words aimed at current malpractices.

Mr. Zhe-sheng's view on China's future can be represented by one sentence—"A Democratic China in a Democratic World." On the National Day of the 33rd year, he said: "The world is moving in the direction of democracy. Although the anti-democratic fascist violence has not been completely eliminated, this reactionary force cannot stop this huge current today." Therefore, in his view, the post-war world should be a democratic world. However, "to establish international democracy, there must be two minimum conditions: First, every nation must be allowed to determine its political form and organize its own life according to the will of its own people. Second, post-war international cooperation must allow all countries, large and small, to be equal. Without these two prerequisites, international democracy is out of the question." Here, he opposes Yale University professor Spykman's "new balance of power theory," because the essence of this balance of power theory is "to weigh everything in terms of one's own interests." When it is necessary to restrain A, one can certainly unite with B; when it is necessary to restrain B, one may as well turn around and unite with A. Can this method guarantee peace in the post-war world? No! Because this is a reprise of the theory of the Nazi German school of geopolitics. On the contrary, Mr. Sun hopes that after the war, the Allied countries of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union can maintain unity forever and unreservedly apply the spirit of the Atlantic Charter to establish friendly relations with various countries in the Far East. Therefore, the post-war world must be built on two foundations: national equality and the universal happiness of mankind. Regarding the happiness of all mankind, two things must be done: First, universally improve the living standards of people in all countries; second, attach importance to the rationalization of both production and distribution to avoid unequal development and national plunder.

Regarding how to deal with Japan in order to create peace in the Far East, Mr. Sun argues that it is necessary to (1) completely destroy Japan's military institutions; (2) disarm Japan's industry. Regarding the complete destruction of Japan's military institutions, the first is to fundamentally eliminate Japan's militaristic education, and the second is to eliminate Japan's military cadres. Regarding the disarmament of Japan's industry, the first is to destroy Japan's remaining military industry, heavy industry, and machinery industry, and the second is to restrict Japan's light industry so that Japan has no opportunity to rearm. In terms of political system, he argues that it is necessary to abolish the Emperor, overthrow the Empire, and establish a truly democratic Japanese Republic.

How can we create a democratic China in a democratic world? In answering this question, Mr. Sun raised three more questions: (1) What kind of China can be considered democratic? (2) Under what conditions can this democratic China be established? (3) What procedures must be followed to realize this democratic China?

A so-called democratic country is a modern country that is "of the people, by the people, and for the people." Mr. Zhongshan said: "The meaning of this of the people, by the people, and for the people is that the country is owned by the people, politics is managed by the people, and the benefits are shared by the people." "The country is owned by the people" means that in this country, regardless of ethnic differences, all people are equal. This country does not belong to any one person or any one group of people, but is owned by all the people. The reason why they can jointly own this country is that, in the process of cultural development, various ethnic groups gradually assimilate and merge and have a common national consciousness. In a democratic country, each individual must maintain this common national consciousness. This is Mr. Zhongshan's nationalism. "Politics is managed by the people" means that the people have the right to jointly manage the country, and an effective government is generated from this people's power to execute their public will. This is Mr. Zhongshan's democracy. "Benefits are shared by the people." Here, on the one hand, the benefits that the people can share are increased through industrialization, and on the other hand, land equalization and capital regulation are used to ensure that the benefits are fairly distributed among the people. This is Mr. Zhongshan's people's livelihood. Therefore, according to Mr. Zhe-sheng's meaning, a democratic China is a China of the Three Principles of the People. However, everyone should not regard this Three Principles of the People as a doctrine unique to the Kuomintang, but as the highest principle that the Republic of China should jointly have in its cultural, political, and economic construction. In recent years, the Communist Party, the Kuomintang, and the Youth Party have all agreed on this point.

To establish this democratic China, Mr. Sun believes that there must be four minimum conditions: (1) legal guarantee of the people's basic freedoms; (2) legal existence of civil political groups; (3) absolute nationalization of the army's military power; (4) completeness of national administration.

As for how to realize this democratic China, Mr. Sun argues: "End the period of political tutelage early, convene the National Assembly, promulgate the constitution, reorganize the government, and implement constitutional government, so that all the people of the country can bear the responsibility of national affairs along the track of the rule of law." Many important issues in the implementation of constitutional government are detailed in Mr. Sun's book "The Three Principles of the People and New China," which will be omitted here.

China is part of the world. After the war, we certainly hope to have a democratic China, and at the same time, we also hope to have a democratic world. The whole world is a complete organism. China's realization of democracy depends on the international democratic spirit, and only with a democratic China can a perfect democratic world be established. Therefore, Mr. Sun said: "In the upsurge of national cultural construction, our task is to promote national culture... while also promoting great harmony and transforming the main factors of the world."

### Review of the Latest Provincial Map of the Republic of China

— Zhu Zhenda

Edited by Yang Jinghua et al., Published by Huan Cheng Publishing House, First Edition, February, Year 35

The War of Resistance has been won, and the rivers and mountains have been restored. However, the rivers and mountains of China have changed somewhat. It is no longer the image of mulberry leaves in the past. Mongolia has been cut off in the north, and Taiwan has been added in the south. The image has naturally changed. When we study geography, maps are the most necessary reference. Whether the map is drawn accurately will affect people's view of the country. During the War of Resistance and after the victory of the War of Resistance, there were many provincial maps of our country published by various bookstores. This year, Huan Cheng Publishing House published the "Latest Provincial Map of the Republic of China." The drawing is more precise, and I will introduce it.

The terrain of the map uses contour lines and layered color grading. At a glance, you can know the elevation of various places, and add numbers to each famous mountain peak to show how much it exceeds sea level. Unfortunately, in this map, such as the altitude of Mount Song and the altitude of Mount Heng, etc., are still lacking.

The printing and binding of this map are better than other maps, and more maps of transportation, soil, terrain, water system, population, climate, temperature, cities, and products are added, which are very suitable for teaching. New geographical information, such as highways and railways, has also been added a lot. Although this map has been carefully planned by the editors, there are still many places to be discussed. Now, based on what I know, I provide the following:

1. The Xianggui Railway was opened to Laibin County in the 30th year. However, the end point of this map is still drawn to Liujiang County. See "Overview of Transportation in the Past Fifteen Years" compiled and printed by the Ministry of Communications in April of the 35th year, and the second volume of geography for junior high schools approved by the Ministry of Education.

2. The Xukun Railway was opened to Qujing County in the 30th year, and then the Yunnan-Burma Railway tracks were rebuilt to Zhanyi County. But this map is missing. - See the same as above.

3. The Qian Gui Railway was opened to Dushan County in the 32nd year and reached Duyun County in the 33rd year, but the end point of this map is still drawn to Dushan. - See "Overview of Transportation in the Past Fifteen Years" compiled and printed by the Ministry of Communications.

4. The Qijiang Railway from Jiangjin County in the southwest of Chongqing to Qijiang County is missing. - See the Dagong Bao on November 10, 34th year.

5. The railway from Xianyang County on the Longhai Railway through Jingyang County, Sanyuan County, Yaoxian County to Tongguan County. This map is missing. - See "Overview of Transportation in the Past Fifteen Years" compiled and printed by the Ministry of Communications.

6. The railway from Dongguan on the Tongpu Road through Qin County to Changzhi County is missing on this map. - See the same as above.

7. The railway from Shijiazhuang to Zhide County is also missing on this map. - See the same as above and the Geography Textbook of Chinese Geography Society issued by the Geography Society of China (edited by Tan Lian, seventh edition, April of the 30th year)

8. The Guisui Highway from Sansui County on the Xiangqian Highway through Tianzhu County, Jinping County into Xiang Province through Jing County, and to Guilin City in Guangxi Province. This map only has the Guilin Longsheng section in Guangxi Province. - See the second volume of geography for junior high schools approved by the Ministry of Education.

9. Huichuan County was established in the 33rd year, governing Guanbao Town, by dividing the boundaries of Lintao County, Weiyuan County, Kangle County, Longxi County, Tan County, and Min County in Gansu Province. This map is missing. See the article by Mr. Li Yunsheng in the June issue of Travel Magazine, Volume 20.

10. On the east bank of the Muluwusu River in the southern territory of Qinghai Province, there is Chengtuo Tusi, one of the 25 tribes of Yushu Tusi. Chengtuo County was added in the 26th year, governing Zhoujun. This map is missing. - See the National Administrative Region Brief Table compiled by the Ministry of Internal Affairs on November 9, 27th year.

### My Life

— By Lao She

Published by Huiqun Publishing House, August 1946, Zhu Li

Everyone who has read Lao She's works probably has a feeling: there is deep irony in the lighthearted stories. If one cannot appreciate this poignant irony and treats his writing as a joke, then one truly fails to understand the author's intention. Ordinary people regard humor and satire as mere amusement, which not only wrongs the value of the works but also slanders the author's painstaking efforts.

Creating a typical character requires extracting specific traits from numerous concrete events, not arbitrarily sampling from them. Lao She's "My Life" depicts the life of a patrolman, a typical patrolman, not a patrolman with a specific name. After reading "My Life," I feel sympathy for these so-called dregs of society, but it also makes us think about a question: why does society have these dregs? Who makes them become dregs?

As a child, he had some schooling, although not much, enough to read "The Seven Heroes and Five Gallants" and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and the like. Due to the limitations of the social environment, he could only learn a craft to make a living at first. He learned to be a paperhanger, which was quite popular at the time. Moreover, he understood human relationships and was willing to be subservient, so he smoothly completed his apprenticeship in three years. After completing his apprenticeship, he became a person of the streets, young, capable, and knowledgeable. He was very successful in his trade. However, misfortune came; his young wife ran away with someone else. Heartbroken, coupled with the gossip of others, he became depressed: he drank, smoked, and changed his profession. He changed his profession to become a patrolman. At that time, patrolmen and rickshaws were the two railway tracks arranged for the poor in big cities. Those who were illiterate and had no skills had to pull rickshaws, and those who had skills but could not earn a living had to become patrolmen. At that time, patrolmen earned six dollars a month and a uniform. It didn't take much connection to become a patrolman. A patrolman who was law-abiding, regardless of winter or summer, regardless of sunny or rainy days, would manage vehicles, horses, pedestrians, fights, and quarrels on the road. There was no "extra income," and he would earn six dollars a month. However, these six dollars were not easy to earn. Being on the streets all day long, one had to be eloquent, act according to circumstances, turn big problems into small ones, and small problems into nothing, so as not to cause trouble for the officials and to make everyone get by. Truth and falsehood were all considered skills. The patience and ability he learned when he was learning his craft allowed him to steadily earn six dollars a month. Soon, changes came; the "Great Qing Empire" was changed to the "Republic of China." He heard that "once the Republic is changed, everything will be managed by the people." However, he did not see the reality. He was promoted from a patrolman on the street to a third-class guard watching the door for officials. He felt that times had changed. The Republic was indeed free. In the Qing Dynasty, everything had a standard. Those who wore blue cloth gowns had to wear blue cloth gowns, even if they had money. Once the Republic came, there was freedom in the mansions. As long as you had money, you could wear whatever you wanted. Soon, he had a good opportunity to be a guard for Mr. Feng, acting as Mr. Feng's follower, with a horse to ride and a black woolen uniform to wear. He only stayed with Mr. Feng for three short months because Mr. Feng stepped down, and he was transferred to the General Bureau to work, and he even received a copper medal, as if he had made some contribution in the mansion. After working for ten years, he was promoted to first-class police, earning nine yuan a month. When he reached the age of forty, his luck came and he became a patrol leader. After being a patrol leader for two years, white hair appeared on his head; his son and daughter, who had no mother, had grown up. His son wanted to work and became a clerk; his daughter was given to a clerk. He himself wanted to be active outside and looked for opportunities with Mr. Feng again. The opportunity came, and the order was to be a guard captain. Because Mr. Feng was out of luck, he did not take office and was transferred back to the epidemic prevention office as a guard. As he got older, he also married a daughter-in-law. He thought he should keep a beard, so he kept a beard. However, the new Director-General of the General Bureau could not understand him. During the inspection, he discovered these old and decaying things and dismissed him. After being idle for half a year, he managed to get a job in Henan as a soldier in the Tax Evasion Suppression Team, and later he was promoted to platoon leader. His son had a grandson, but his son died. He had to take care of his young daughter-in-law and young grandson, and he could not find a job in his hometown, so he had to do odd jobs. He guarded empty houses, helped people sell vegetables, worked as a plasterer's helper, and helped people move... The old man in his fifties did the work of a young man in his twenties, with only thin porridge and corn bread in his stomach. Hunger and excessive hard work, as well as fifty years of experience, made him realize: "I have treated everyone well, I have no problems in my heart, so what else can I say? I am waiting to starve to death, and there will definitely be no coffin after my death, and my daughter-in-law and grandson will have to starve to death with me, so I have no choice but to do this! Who told me to be a patrolman! My eyes often turn black, and I seem to have touched death. Hmph! I still laugh, laugh at my lifetime of intelligence and ability, laugh at this extraordinarily unfair world, and hope that when I laugh to the last sound, this world will change!"

Lao She's description is very lighthearted. Those who only read the story think it is just a story, but when you taste it carefully, there is a heavy feeling. Is this narrow path the only way that society arranges for this lifetime?

Lao She did not answer this question. He only raised the question and also raised hope, "Hope that when I laugh to the last sound, this world will change!"

The subject matter Lao She used, in terms of time, is from the late Qing Dynasty to the present Republic of China; in terms of location, it is a simple northern ancient city; in terms of characters, it is kind people with pure nature and a bit of servility. The whole book is written in the first person, using his own mouth to tell his life, so it is named "My Life."

Spring and Autumn

### Father

— Yang Mou

Children:

History does not repeat itself, but rights and obligations must be circulated for you to enjoy and bear. My father once earnestly warned me, and now it is my turn to warn you. I only thought about work, work, but never thought about getting old, but looking back on the past, I unexpectedly know that my era is already far away.

You must understand my feelings. But what you understand is only from your perspective.

Children and I are inseparable. I cultivate with blood, and I nourish with sweat, but I never thought about harvesting. Children are my greatest hope and greatest sustenance, because the value of children in my life cannot be estimated.

Over the years, I worked day and night because I didn't want to disappoint you, nor did I want you to not get the enjoyment you deserve. There are many rich fathers in the world, and there are also many poor fathers, but their hearts are the same. They all cultivate their children with all their hearts and dedicate their whole lives to their children. For you, I don't want to say how much effort I have put in, because this is an inevitable responsibility, but I have indeed suffered many times of cold looks. For you, I have learned to tolerate.

Fathers cultivate children because not only are children their sons, but children are hope, and children are the future.

You children, just look at your own hope, your own future, and move forward. Your brave advancement is how you are encouraging your father. No matter how hard life is, fathers don't want to get rewards from their children. Fathers have never calculated for their children, although fathers often calculate for their children.

I also know how obedient you were when you were young. But when you grow up, you more or less regard my words as a burden. I am very happy that you have your own decisions, your own thoughts, and your own era, but I still say it because it can provide some of my experience. I believe you have great development, but I never hope that I will only shape my children into people like me. You must be a thousand times, ten thousand times greater than your father.

I can still work, and I will continue to work.

I want to manage you. I want to keep my eyes on you, and my heart beats with you, but I want you not to manage me, to forget me, and to work hard and bravely forward.

Life's experiences are bitter. Having experienced vicissitudes, I don't care about your material support. As long as you give me spiritual satisfaction and comfort, this is your greatest support for me.

Your life must bloom, and your life must bear fruit. My blood, my sweat, and my life are all permeated in your life, and my life will also be brilliant for a long time through your life!

Father, Father's Day 1946

### Mrs. Li's Troubles

— Zhang Muyao

Mrs. Li has been very troubled these past two days. Let this be the proof: she hasn't gone to Grand Brightness Cinema for three whole days!

Mr. Li has been rushing home these past weeks with a flustered look on his face. His restless posture resembles a bear in a dragon costume. His fat, oily face has suddenly thinned, and his small eyes have sunken in half an inch deep. She knows that the stock market has been plummeting, and the "hat" (short selling) that Mr. Li snatched is about to be forced onto his own head. Because of this, Mr. Li's favorite braised pork knuckle had to be shelved in the cupboard untouched; no need to cook rice either, the nanny can temporarily borrow a few meals from Mrs. Wang next door. As for herself, a little milk and soda is enough.

Looking back to a year and a half ago when she just gave birth to Xiao Ling, they lived in that small room on Wuding Road. At that time, Mr. Li was still a clerk in some fake tax bureau, and she braved the wind and rain to squeeze in front of the Fook Hong rice store, reaching out her hand to snatch the rationed rice like a robbery. She was disheartened all day from carrying the rice and firewood; Xiao Ling also looked like a skinny monkey because she couldn't suck out any milk. It was only with great difficulty that Mr. Li hooked up with his director, borrowed some capital, and was introduced to the stock exchange to do some genuine buying and selling. Thanks to God's blessing, things actually went smoothly, and life gradually became more exquisite and beautiful! Alas, only a year and a half! Seeing this hard-earned family business—including a foreign house, three hundred mu of fertile land, a rickshaw, etc.—swaying in the wind and rain, how can Mrs. Li not be anxious!

She just put on a new summer dress made by Hongxiang. Staying at home all day is not an option; for someone with troubles, home seems to be a breeding ground for troubles. It's better to go out and relax. But where to go? Mrs. Li began to search for objects to clear away her troubles in her mind. Catching the 6:30 pm show at Grand Brightness would be perfect. The film is some Atlantic war film, but Mrs. Li gets nauseous at the sight of those repetitive men and women on the screen. Then, how about sitting and listening to music at the newly opened ×× Night Garden? Ah, no, sitting alone there is worse than lying at home. Moreover, the word "music" makes her head roar like a motor. Then, how about going to number 104 to see Mr. Li and inquire about today's news? But that won't work either: is he even there? Even if he is, that gloomy face is like it's pasted right in front of her; she's really a bit afraid. What to do? Even the Great Shanghai that she's always been fascinated with doesn't have a place for her to go! Then, she might as well go to Mrs. Dong's house to play four rounds of mahjong, but each "Bamboo," "Sticks," and "Characters" tile feels like it has thorns; how can her pair of delicate, tapered hands dare to touch them! Oh, mentioning Mrs. Dong couldn't help but remind her of a conversation last night. Mrs. Dong burst into the house with a gust of fragrant powder, running and jumping, shouting:

"Mrs. Li, you haven't come to play mahjong for two days, what's up? Come on, let's play four rounds."

"Well, I, I'm not in the mood at all!"

"Look at your frowning face, haha! Is Mr. Li messing around outside again, is it?"

"No… it's not that!"

"Hey, don't hide it from me! Screw him, he can play and you can play too. If he spends 180,000 today, you spend 200,000 on him. Hmph, that's the way to deal with men. Come on, let's go…"

…

The door opened with a creak, and the nanny came in carrying Xiao Ling. Xiao Ling ran up to her, babbling and opening her two round arms to ask her mother to hold her. Her little feet accidentally touched Mrs. Li's Cheviot tweed coat. She quickly took a step back and patted Xiao Ling's plump, adorable face. Xiao Ling, not getting her expected desire, dropped her little arms, widened her round eyes, and shrank her little mouth, as if she was ready to burst into tears at any moment. Mrs. Li hurriedly turned around and said softly:

"Wang Ma, take her out to play."

The shadow of dusk gently covered the window hole like a large wing. The cool wind of early summer jumped in from the window, like an uninvited guest wanting to give the host a shock. Mrs. Li subconsciously closed the window. The sharp sound of the radio drifted from not far away, mixed with the sound of cars speeding on the road, bringing a kind of emptiness and hasty sadness to the dusk. Mrs. Li really wanted to be happy, but she unconsciously took off her coat and threw it on the bed, collapsing onto the sofa and falling into deep thought…

…Everything was silent! Everything went black! Her body rose up step by step like sitting in a hoist bucket, up, up, up, and suddenly, she fell onto the floor as if shocked from the air. Just as Mrs. Li was about to touch her heart and sigh, the door slid open halfway, and a dark shadow squeezed in. Gradually, gradually it became bigger, taller! Just like that terrifying head in "Phantom of the Opera." Mrs. Li raised her face, desperately trying to call Wang Ma, but her mouth was blocked by a wet cotton swab. Her body seemed to be getting tighter and tighter by the black shadow, almost unable to breathe. She fell! She fell! Mrs. Li clenched her fist, wanting to reject and push the black shadow that was pressing on her, so she bravely opened her eyes. The room was brightly lit, and she saw a disheveled head of hair, bloodshot eyes, and a pale face… How strange this face is! Hey, how familiar it is! She scrutinized it carefully for a moment, oh, isn't this Mr. Li, who worries about her every minute and second! How did he turn into this after just one night of not seeing each other? She opened her arms, wanting to pounce on him, but Mr. Li slowly shook his head and slowly lowered it again. She panicked. Looking at the furnishings in the room, ah! The suits and cheongsams in the cabinet were scattered all over the floor, which were fine just now, what's going on?… Suddenly, a wisp of sadness like the sob emitted from a bowstring rang in her ear:

"Sufang, it's over! Everything is over!… Pack up now!… Let's go… Where's Xiao Ling!"

"…" Mrs. Li stood there blankly, black patches and sparks dancing in front of her eyes, the sound of snow, the sound of collapse, rolling in her ears… She, she fell forward weakly, and cried out with a "wa"…

"Madam, madam, wake up!" Wang Ma stood in front of the weeping Mrs. Li in her dreams, carrying Xiao Ling, opened her dull mouth, and looked at this mistress who had been melancholic for a few days, as if she wanted to ask:

"Fortunate madam, what else are you dissatisfied with?"

When Mrs. Li realized that she had gone through this nightmare, her heart twisted with sadness and pain.

"This is a premonition! This is a premonition…" she murmured, repeating the words.

It was completely dark outside the window. Her body was sticky, and her eyes were also blurry. She reached out her hand and wiped them with a handkerchief. When she stared at Xiao Ling's pair of round, surprised little eyes, she snatched her from Wang Ma's hands, hugged her tightly, as if afraid that someone would snatch her away, and kissed Xiao Ling's cheeks, forehead, mouth, and every part frantically…

### Melancholy of the Jialing River

— Xiaofeng

One of the Jialing River Scattered Tunes

The water of the Jialing River turns green and then yellow.

When the spring breeze turns the water of the Jialing River green, the summer rain brings a turbid yellow color to the Jialing River. Children growing up on the banks of the Jialing River all know when the water of the Jialing River will turn green and when the water of the Jialing River will become turbid mud. They can very familiarly point out what kind of boat is a coal boat and what kind of boat is a speedboat, because the colors and styles of the boats have been deeply imprinted in their hearts. However, they don't know more deeply that in the green and then yellow water of the Jialing River, there are buried infinite tears and melancholy.

When the spring water is green, the boats on the Jialing River gradually increase, white sails, melodious boatman songs, floating on the Jialing River. At this time, a small boat creaks out of the river bend. A young man holds the rudder and paddles hard. In the center of the small boat are two small baskets, filled with baked sesame cakes and a bowl of radish shreds mixed with soy sauce and chili. On a small wooden frame, there are many sesame cakes filled with radish shreds. A young woman sits beside the frame, looking melancholy.

They paddle their small boat close to the large wooden boat drifting down the river, pulling hard on the side of the large wooden boat.

"Sir, want to eat sesame cakes? They're cooked, radish shred sesame cakes!" the young woman shouted with a bitter smile.

The passengers on the big boat all glanced at her with disdain. "Too unhygienic!" they all said in a low voice.

"Sir, want to eat sesame cakes? They're cooked, sesame cakes with radish shreds!" Her voice gradually lowered, and the shadow of disappointment struck her heart.

"Let go! What are you always pulling for!" the boatmen cursed rudely. She had no choice but to let go, push the small boat away from the big boat, and let the young man in the back of the small boat paddle the small boat upstream, towards another wooden boat drifting down the river.

"Damn, stinky thing!" the boatmen still quietly added this sentence, although their boat had already drifted down, and the cool wind on the river would not bring this harsh curse back to her ears.

"Sir, want to eat sesame cakes? They're cooked, filled with radish shreds!" From the upper reaches of the river, the gloomy and melancholy voice floats again…

The summer sun turns the leaves of the trees green, but it turns the water of the Jialing River yellow. The river water rushes under the scorching sun, roaring, licking the rocks on the riverbank with its turbid yellow tongue, stirring up wild waves at the foot of the mountain.

At this time, the creaking small boat no longer comes out of the river bend, and the sad cry can no longer be heard. The young man picks up his simple luggage and quietly walks out of the thatched cottage deep in the river bend, heading towards the road of life. The young woman leans against the crumbling earthen wall, silently watching the disappearing back in the distance, crystalline tears falling silently…

The water of the Jialing River turns green and then yellow, and the sound of the Jialing River is always so melancholy!

We want to promote world peace forever, so that all fathers in the world can be comforted.

### Maiden (Selected World Famous Paintings)

— By Greuze (1725–1805)

Displayed at the National Gallery, London

Many artists and writers often lack a correct understanding and evaluation of their own works; Jean Baptiste Greuze is a very prominent example. He considered himself a history painter, and this self-misunderstanding led him to misfortune. Due to his painstaking research on customs and manners, he was elected as a member of the French Academy. Because he was slow to hand in his diploma painting, the academy finally had to prohibit him from exhibiting his works again until he handed in his diploma painting. In the end, he submitted his painting, which was a work that tried hard to prove that he was a history painter. As a result, it failed greatly and was even reprimanded by the president of the academy. At this time, Greuze had already accepted the ceremonial honor. From then on, he closed his door for many years and refused to exhibit his works.

This incident proves that if a person lacks understanding of himself, it is enough to affect his achievements. Greuze's achievements were his family life scenes, which were loved by a wide audience.

Due to his hard work, he accumulated a lot of wealth; however, he eventually squandered all his money again; in his later years, he could not help but request work that his physical strength could not handle. In 1805, he died in extreme poverty in La Ferte. "Maiden" shows Greuze's most pleasant style and is also his acclaimed work.—Cheng Lu附志.

### Tan's Bamboo Carving

— Wu Shuangren

Carving is a branch of art, occupying a very important position in the history of fine arts. However, seal carving and bamboo carving are unique arts of our country. The author has a collection of bamboo and stone paintings (stone refers to books and stone rubbings); because of his love for bamboo and stone, he also developed a fondness for carving. Moreover, because it is better to rely on oneself than to ask others, I have tried my hand at carving, but I am ashamed that I have not yet reached the level of mastery, but I can barely be considered an initiate. Since the prevalence of seals, many specialized books recording stone carving have been published; daily and monthly publications also contain writings on the subject. However, there are hardly any works that record bamboo carving. There are only "Records of Bamboo Carvers" and "Biographies of Bamboo Carvers," which compile the biographies of bamboo carvers, providing brief accounts and artistic critiques, but never mention the methods of bamboo carving. I, despite my limited knowledge, dare to offer my humble opinion in this casual discussion, hoping it may serve as an introduction.

To carve bamboo, one must first collect good quality bamboo! The most suitable material is water-polished white bamboo, which is warm, smooth, and elegant. Stroking it morning and evening, it naturally matures over time, the bamboo green (bamboo skin) gradually turning to beeswax yellow, then from yellow to red; like playing with red and white Han jade, it slowly becomes transparent and red, arousing interest. Those who appreciate bamboo should never rub it with oil from their nose or cheeks! Although rubbing with oil makes it redden easily, it is different from natural reddening; the former has a blackish tinge, while the latter appears blood-red, the difference being significant. To make it redden naturally and quickly, there is also a method: it can be hung in a well-ventilated place, where the air movement allows it to gradually turn red. However, the bamboo object must be changed in position and direction from time to time, so that all sides are exposed to the wind equally. Otherwise, the side facing the wind will redden while the side facing away will remain pale, and the overall color will never be uniform. If you find the "wind blowing method" too slow, you can use the "oil soaking method," taking good quality vegetable oil or peanut oil, boiling it thoroughly, letting it cool, and then applying it to the bamboo surface, which will redden more easily. Each time after soaking in oil, the excess must be wiped clean! Otherwise, it will easily develop mold, especially during the plum rain season. It is better to carve bamboo after it has reddened, as it is more refined than newly cut bamboo, which is full of fiery energy. However, the disadvantage of bamboo treated with the oil soaking method is that the bamboo fibers (the fine fibers inside the bamboo) are softened by the oil penetrating into the core, making it easy to "slip the knife" when carving.

When selecting water-polished white bamboo, the following should be noted: (1) The bamboo green should be even and smooth; (2) the bamboo fibers should be fine and without varying depths; (3) avoid cracks (it is best to buy more bamboo material in advance and, after one or two years, inspect it for cracks, which indicates suitability. If you buy and use it immediately from the store, you will often encounter newly cut material that will crack immediately after the onset of the mold season); (4) thick and large material is preferred; (5) neither the bamboo green nor the bamboo yellow (bamboo flesh) should have stains or black spots; (6) carefully check the bamboo for small holes. If there are holes, it is a sign of internal woodworms. Immediately isolate it from other bamboo to prevent infection, which will lead to all the bamboo being infested (any bamboo object with tiny bamboo powder is sure to have woodworm holes).

Stationery items such as pen holders, poem containers, armrests, and ink beds are mostly made of water-polished white bamboo because white bamboo is available in large sizes, allowing for easy selection. For fan bones, tobacco pipes, walking sticks, xiao flutes, and dizi flutes, the material selection is wider, such as mottled bamboo, plum bamboo, chicken-wire bamboo, peach-skin bamboo, and palm bamboo. Among these, fan bones have the widest range of materials. Taking square bamboo for fan bones is particularly valuable, as its surface is flat and even, and it does not arch; when it turns beeswax yellow, it resembles blood-colored ivory, making it very lovable. Some imitations of square bamboo are made by vertically cutting and selecting from large bamboo. Thick bamboo with a large diameter can be split into narrow strips without any visible curvature.

Carving bamboo is more valuable if famous artists create the calligraphy and paintings, or if rubbings of inscriptions on metal and stone are used, as these are extremely antique and unadorned. However, the calligraphy and painting should be done directly on the bamboo surface! If paper is used as a draft, pasting it onto the bamboo before carving will inevitably lead to distortion. However, bamboo is smooth and not easy to take ink, so you can apply a thin layer of tooth powder or cosmetic powder, which allows you to apply the brush as desired and transfer the image as you like. This refers to the bamboo yellow that has been skinned. If writing or painting on the bamboo skin, simply wipe off the oil.

When practicing bamboo carving, first use inferior bamboo to carve and pick at lines, until you reach a level where the strokes are straight and vertical, and then practice turning and hooking. Only when you feel that you have mastered the use of your wrist and have full confidence can you formally carve bamboo.

There are different methods of carving: yin carving (like white text in seals), yang carving (like red text in seals), and skin carving (also known as "leaving green," which leaves the bamboo green as the yang carved calligraphy and painting). The most striking and eye-catching is "scorched earth leaving green," where, except for the yang carved calligraphy and painting, the rest is dyed a deep color to make it scorched yellow, further highlighting the light and dark contrasting patterns and background, which is very beautiful. However, only the famous artist Zhang Zhiyu in Peiping (Beijing) can do this, and he has now passed it on to outstanding disciples. Few bamboo carvers in the South are capable of this.

To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools! The main tool for bamboo carving is a knife (sometimes a needle is also needed). If the bamboo carving knife does not feel comfortable in the hand, it will greatly affect the work. Among the ready-made bamboo carving knives on the market, those made by Wang Mazi Iron Shop in Peiping are the best, but even they are not perfect. It is better to make your own! The best material is the elastic strip from the inside of a clock or watch. This strip is made of pure steel; take a section of it (not too long, otherwise it will be difficult to exert force when carving), and tightly bind it to a bamboo handle (split a small section of bamboo and attach the knife to make a handle), and then it can be used. If you are carving small characters like fly heads, you should use a steel needle! For convenience, you can also use a sewing needle, preferably a German one. For extremely small cursive script, you can apply ink to the black bamboo surface and then use a steel needle to carve it; no eyesight is needed, it all depends on the skilled technique of the fingers.

Before carving, wrap the entire bamboo with mulberry paper (other paper is also acceptable)! When you want to carve a certain area, tear off the paper from that area. Otherwise, inadvertently, the calligraphy and painting may be rubbed off by your fingers, or become blurred and lose their original charm.

Use both finger and wrist strength when carving, but do not exert too much force; it should be soft yet firm, firm yet soft, able to release and retain, wanting to remove but hesitating to leave, so as to avoid slipping the knife, and it will not be distorted, and will be consistent with the original calligraphy and painting. When moving the knife, whether it is a stroke or a line, first cut off the upper and lower bamboo fibers. Then the left and right, and then repair the bottom. The work of repairing the bottom is especially important, and the slightest negligence will blemish the jade and ruin the whole effort.

There are various carving methods: deep carving, shallow carving, deep and shallow carving, flat-bottom carving, and angled-bottom carving. Deep and shallow carving are easy to understand, so I will not explain them. Deep and shallow carving involves making certain parts of a picture or character deeper or shallower, as appropriate, which is very beautiful. Flat-bottom carving makes the background flat and smooth, without any unevenness, which is very beautiful. Angled-bottom carving means that the edges of the yin-carved characters are all beveled. The former gives a sense of neatness, while the latter, due to the reflection of the beveled surface, displays the brushstrokes and knife work, making it particularly eye-catching. Therefore, when carving landscapes, flowers, and birds, one should consider the situation and use either flat-bottom or angled-bottom carving. Rocks and mountains are generally suitable for angled carving, while smoky clouds are suitable for flat carving. The outlines should be slightly deeper, while waterfalls and rivers should be slightly shallower. Understand this spiritually, it depends on the individual, and skill comes from practice. These are all things that can be understood intuitively, and cannot be specified in words.

There are also various types of backgrounds for yang carving: jujube skin background, walnut background, the two being the same except that the former is less bumpy. Sand background is like spreading powder, mat background, horsetail background as the name suggests. In short, to put it all together, there are hemp backgrounds and smooth backgrounds.

After the bamboo carving is completed, it should be lubricated all over with pine seed oil or walnut oil, which can both cover up the fiery energy of the newly carved work and prevent it from accumulating dirt and dust. This is a small matter, but it is of great use.

To store bamboo carvings, wrap them in newspapers! Because the lead characters on the newspaper are printed with ink, which can prevent woodworms. Alternatively, place a few naphthalene mothballs inside the bamboo object's wrapping, which has the same effect. Do not use Three Kingdoms camphor, as it is too drying and can reduce the natural luster of the bamboo surface.

### Random Talks About Smoking

— Zheng Fan

Here are some common knowledge and anecdotes about cigarettes, I hope you can take the time of smoking a cigarette to finish reading it.

Strolling down the street, the cigarette shops display colorful cigarettes. The beautiful decorations, coupled with the trademarks of American products such as Camel, Philip Morris, etc., will tempt you to linger for a while. Even if you are not an avid smoker, you may touch your purse.

The import of cigarettes into China began in 1890. At that time, sales were limited to Shanghai. Two years later, it spread throughout the country. In the past fifty years, sales have skyrocketed. Today, the consumption of cigarettes has reached an alarming level. When friends meet, they cannot help but take out a cigarette case and offer a cigarette. A cigarette is smoked when mentally depressed, a cigarette is smoked when tired from work, a cigarette is smoked after meals, a cigarette is smoked while defecating, and a cigarette is smoked when there is nothing to do. For editors and writers working late at night, cigarettes are even more a necessary raw material for producing "inspiration." Even ordinary people who don't usually smoke will imitate others by holding a cigarette in their mouths, surrounded by smoke, leisurely and content. Public entertainment venues such as theaters and dance halls, as well as toilet rooms in schools, organizations, and institutions, have become major bases for cigarette consumption. Some have calculated that in big cities, those who never smoke account for less than 5%; in remote rural areas, except for the elderly who still hold dry tobacco pipes or smoke water pipes, almost everyone has a cigarette in their hand.

The Origin of Smoking

Now, please light a cigarette and let me tell you some little stories about smoking first:

It is said that the origin of smoking was purely accidental. In an ancient European festival, a priest who sacrificed to the gods accidentally inhaled a mouthful of smoke and felt a stimulating strange smell. He told the general public, who believed that this was God's will, so priests included smoking as one of the rituals when performing religious ceremonies.

Subsequently, the Greeks invented smoke baths, which were used to remove impurities. The barbaric Scythians also burned firewood to create smoke, dancing and singing in the smoke, taking it as a joy.

Long before the Americas were discovered, the locals already had the habit of smoking. In Central America, many ancient stone carvings depicting smoking relics can still be found.

It can be seen that the origin of smoking was originally a religious ritual, and later it was considered a medicine for treating diseases. The Frenchman Jean Nicot once said that smoking can cure syphilis, cough, asthma, headache, thyroid and other diseases. As for the invention of cigarettes, that was only about a hundred years ago. This is the origin of smoking.

Several Sections of "Smoking Studies"

Professor John Pallache, a professor at the University of Berlin, is a person who specializes in the study of "smoking and health." He believes that cigarettes contain many powerful toxins, such as nicotine, cymonia, cyanide, arsenic, etc. However, he does not oppose smoking, and he himself is a very avid smoker. However, he especially warned those who have a fondness for cigarettes not to smoke only the same kind of cigarettes, but must change them frequently, because the toxins contained in various cigarettes are not uniform. If they are changed frequently, the toxins will not accumulate more and more, affecting human health.

Do you like to smoke American cigarettes? Maybe you are holding a "Marlboro" or "Chesterfield" in your hand right now. But please forgive me for giving you a blunt piece of advice: According to Dr. Pallache's examination, American-made cigarettes contain the most toxins. Turkish cigarettes are second, and Chinese cigarettes are much better.

Regarding the causes of smoking poisoning, according to the research of Drs. Bardenhauer, Nag, and Diggmann, the human body can absorb more than 60% of the tobacco in ordinary smoking. If the smoke is inhaled into the lungs, the human body can absorb up to 93% of the tobacco. Normally, one thousand cubic centimeters of tobacco contains about two to seven parts of tobacco. Those who smoke forty cigarettes a day have 224 parts of tobacco inhaled into their bodies. If a person who does not smoke is made to inhale 20 parts at once, it is already life-threatening.

The toxic effects of tobacco are manifested in the heart and blood vessels. Because tobacco can increase the blood pressure of smokers, causing pathological phenomena of arteriosclerosis, and even causing cardiomegaly. In addition, it can also stimulate the system, especially the digestive organs, and paralyze the central nervous system of the heart.

However, on the other hand, for healthy people, smoking a few cigarettes does not cause much harm after all. But you cannot smoke too much. You must not exceed forty cigarettes a day no matter what. People with heart disease or lung disease should not smoke at all.

Talking About Careful Chewing

Open the cigarette case, and the neat cigarettes are exposed in front of you. The white paper wraps the golden tobacco leaves. It seems that it is very simple to manufacture, but in fact, it is very troublesome from cutting the tobacco leaves into shreds to rolling the shreds into cigarettes. If you don’t think it’s verbose, I would like to give a brief description of the cigarette manufacturing process:

The first step is leaf blending. After each mark of tobacco is handed over by the factory director, it is weighed by the deputy. For example, if 4,000 pounds of leaves are required, then forty rattan baskets with a capacity of 100 pounds are used. Each box contains various ingredients of tobacco leaves, which are then steamed soft by the leaf steaming truck. After steaming, they are transported by mountain movement to the butting department, and the cut leaf heads are handed over to the tobacco stem department. The tobacco leaves are put into spice barrels, mixed with spices, and weighed again in wooden boxes. After 24 hours, they are handed over to the tobacco cutting department for shredding, with a standard of three-quarters of a millimeter. High-quality tobacco is steamed once first, handed over to the leaf splitting department to remove the stems, and then put into the leaf steaming truck for re-steaming. Spices are added and put into boxes. After 20 hours, they are shredded and prepared for use. As for the tobacco stems, they must also be mixed with ingredients, rolled flat and shredded, and dried separately. They are passed through the screen powder truck to remove the long ones and put them into the tobacco drying tube and mixed into the tobacco shreds.

The dried tobacco shreds are stored in the tobacco shred room, which is equipped with hot air pipes and moisture pipes, which are used as needed. Then these tobacco shreds are handed over to the cigarette rolling truck, and thousands of cigarettes are rolled out. After rolling, they are given to the tin packaging room for packing, and then boxed, labeled, weighed, and sold.

The cigarette in your hand has been manufactured through such a complicated process. When you are "carefully chewing", have you ever thought about how difficult it is to come by?

Cigarette Cards

In the past, cigarette cases often contained cards for business promotion. It was produced in 1894, when Messrs. Wills in England invented putting small cards in the package. This small card was the world's first cigarette card, and the picture was of a hundred soldiers. Since then, everyone has scrambled to imitate, and cigarette cards have become popular. Some people who specialize in collecting such cards, like those stamp collectors, devote their lives to their work. In England, cards from decades ago can be worth dozens of pounds. One card tells the story of Winston Churchill escaping from Pretoria, printed on the back of Napoleon III's image, and is now considered extremely valuable. Many collectors are willing to buy that card at a huge price.

In foreign countries, there are specialized companies that buy cigarette cards, and their business is very developed. One company collects hundreds of thousands of different cards and hires three thousand collectors to collect them for him.

A few years ago, many people in China also collected portraits of characters from Investiture of the Gods or Journey to the West in cigarette cases. Especially children, they loved the cigarette cards the most.

A presumptuous suggestion: If cigarette cards use good books and teaching materials, it may not be a good education. Moreover, the effect must be great, I think.

Save the Cigarette Industry

I have written a lot in a disorganized manner, and finally I want to talk about China's current cigarette industry.

Amidst the influx of American goods, cigarettes are also one of the main items. Because Chinese people think that "imported goods must be new," and the price is not expensive, American cigarettes such as Camel, Philip Morris, Lucky Strike, and Raleigh have occupied most of the middle-class smokers. Although domestic cigarettes are cheaper, the difference is only one or two hundred yuan, which has obviously lost its appeal to customers. China's cigarette industry is already full of depression—no, it has reached the point of collapse.

Look at the news in the newspaper:——

"Recently, Guangzhou City has been flooded with duty-free foreign cigarettes, and the local cigarettes have been severely hit. More than 80 manufacturers have closed down, and more than 60 have gone bankrupt. The situation is serious. The number of cigarette workers who have lost their jobs has reached 30,000...."(Shen Bao, June 5)

"Because this factory has been oppressed by foreign goods, the silver has been very tight recently. In addition, the workers are demanding fees every day, which is difficult to maintain. We have no choice but to break the pot and announce the liquidation." (Announcement of the liquidation of accounts by the Star Cigarette Factory, July 17)

Look at the cigarette in your hand, is it also a foreign product? If so, please think about the tragic decline of China's tobacco industry! Please think about the future of China's national industry! Please think about the astronomical figures of the outflow of national interests! Please think about the countless unemployed workers who are struggling on the hunger line! Can you still bear to smoke foreign cigarettes? (Written on the eve of International Cigarette Festival)

### The Difficulties of the Cigarette Industry: An Interview with Bauer

— Cang Fu

Before the Pacific War, the British-American Tobacco Company, organized by foreign capital, was known for its superior production conditions, including strong capital, large scale, complete equipment, and abundant products. No wonder it firmly grasped the reins of China's cigarette industry. After this victory, although the British-American Tobacco Company did not lose these advantageous conditions, with the changes in the domestic economic environment, the business of this large foreign tobacco institution seemed to have become sluggish, no longer with the posture of its heyday. In order to understand the company's current situation, the reporter made a special trip to interview Mr. Bauer, the company's business manager. Mr. Bauer eloquently described the difficulties currently encountered by the company in four points to the reporter.

Raw Materials

First, he raised the issue of obtaining cigarette raw materials. It is said that the main raw materials currently needed by the company are nothing more than four items: tobacco leaves, cigarette paper, wood, and various accessories used in cigarette machines. Speaking of tobacco leaves, the better quality ones are the American tobacco leaves produced in Shandong, Henan, and Anhui provinces. These provinces were able to produce in large quantities before the war. After the outbreak of the war, railway transportation was cut off, and coal, fertilizer, and fresh tobacco seeds were all in short supply. As a result, the quality of tobacco leaf production was greatly reduced. Not only that, before the war, all legitimate tobacco merchants could directly go to the tobacco-producing areas and directly purchase tobacco leaves from the tobacco farmers. However, the war created opportunities for a generation of speculators. On the one hand, they bought from tobacco farmers at low prices, discouraging tobacco farmers from planting tobacco seeds again. On the other hand, they took advantage of the reduction in production to create opportunities for their monopoly manipulation. As a result, the market price of tobacco leaves has risen to a level that manufacturers cannot afford. To remedy these shortcomings, Mr. Bauer believes that efforts should be made to restore transportation and help tobacco farmers obtain coal, fertilizer, and fresh tobacco seeds. At the same time, legitimate tobacco merchants should be facilitated to directly purchase tobacco leaves from tobacco farmers, so that tobacco farmers can get reasonable prices to encourage them to increase production.

Paper Products

As for the various paper products used in the cigarette industry, Mr. Bauer believes that there are quite a few types. However, domestic products are really not easy to find. And all countries in the world are also experiencing shortages. Wood is mostly used for cigarette packaging. The current supply is very small, and the price is surprisingly high. As for the problem of obtaining cigarette machine parts, it is even more urgent at present. It is said that the machines of the company's various factories have suffered extremely heavy depreciation and wear and tear during the enemy's occupation. A large number of machine parts are needed to supplement the repair in order to restore the production efficiency of the pre-war heyday. However, most of these accessories depend on foreign countries. The delay in the arrival of accessories has invisibly delayed the restoration of production efficiency.

Production

The second difficulty, Mr. Bauer talked about the company's current production problems. It is said that it is unbearable to look back on the past! He listed three reasons: (1) Most of the factories are shut down or in a semi-shutdown state. It is said that the company's main factory in Hankou, as well as all the machines and equipment, have been destroyed by bombing. The Yingkou and Yingkou branch factories have all stopped production. The Tianjin and Qingdao branch factories are in a semi-shutdown state. This is because after the coastal and other transportation routes were completely cut off, the company was unable to supply the various branch factories with the urgently needed main raw materials, which led to this. The factory in Pudong, Shanghai, is also unable to start work under the current circumstances. The reason is that it is impossible to guarantee a continuous supply of coal energy, and even if there is, the price of this coal will be too high for the company to afford.

Transportation

In addition, the various costs of transporting and relocating goods from Pudong to Puxi are even more alarming. Therefore, the Pudong factory is currently unable to produce under economic conditions. (2) Labor costs are too expensive. The company pays workers' wages every month according to the cost of living index. The cost of living index is rising day and night, and the company really feels unable to support it. (3) The price of raw materials is high and in short supply. Although the company is currently trying to replenish the various high-quality raw materials before the war, it cannot be done all at once at present, and has to mix in various ordinary-quality raw materials for supplementation. However, production efficiency has been greatly affected as a result. However, even for this ordinary raw material alone, the price is already expensive. Especially the transportation fee, which often exceeds the price of the raw material itself.

Based on the above reasons, Mr. Bauer said that their current production situation is completely uneconomical. Their current production policy is entirely for the welfare of their employees.

Tobacco Tax

The third difficulty that Mr. Bauer talked about is that the domestic taxation on raw materials and finished products is too heavy. As a result, the domestic cigarette industry has been defeated. And foreign cigarettes can sell well in the domestic market. It is said that the taxation methods for finished products are not designed closely enough. At the same time, the implementation of the tax regulations is not ideal. The tax standard is calculated based on the inflated wholesale market price. Taxpayers are also not fully aware of the methods used to calculate these market prices.

Distribution

The last difficulty, Mr. Bauer believes, is the distribution of finished products. He said that the current transportation situation is a complete mess! Taking the transportation between the two major commercial ports of Shanghai and Tianjin as an example, general manufacturers feel that they cannot obtain shipping space. This only creates opportunities for speculators. They try their best to engage in various improper activities to try to sell goods. As a result, no wonder consumers cannot buy cigarettes at reasonable prices. There is also the high soaring of black market interest rates, which makes it impossible for normal distribution agencies to conduct business. Finally, due to the imperfect taxation methods, legitimate manufacturers are naturally unwilling to use the loopholes in these tax regulations, resulting in illegal manufacturers trying their best to evade taxes, while legitimate manufacturers bear the heavy burden of tax rates in vain.

### Foreign Cigarette Dumping: National Cigarette Industry Declines

— Cun Jun

Now, when the bells of victory are ringing, our unexpectedly harvested national cigarette industry has unexpectedly turned to a declining downward path. All kinds of "American-equipped" cigarettes: Camel, Chesterfield, Lucky Strike, Marlboro and other American-made famous cigarettes are almost imported duty-free at the same time as the American troops. When we, these victorious citizens, began to leisurely smoke cheap and good American cigarettes, our national cigarette industry was facing an unprecedented threat!

Following the military cigarettes, since the beginning of this year, the number of American-made cigarette imports, no matter how much it consumes our precious foreign exchange, has been increasing month by month! According to the standards of the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau, the number of American cigarette imports from January to July this year is roughly as follows:

Month Number of Cigarettes Imported

January 150,000 cigarettes

February 4,500,000 cigarettes

March 2,160,000 cigarettes

April 33,060,000 cigarettes

May 23,500,000 cigarettes

June 158,026,700 cigarettes

July 37,570,000 cigarettes

(Monday)

Total 357,966,700 cigarettes

In this way, the number of American cigarette imports has reached an alarming level! Due to time constraints, the total import figures for July are not yet available. However, according to rumors, the total number of American cigarettes imported in July is approximately equal to one-quarter of the total number of cigarettes produced by all Chinese and foreign cigarette factories in Shanghai! If this continues, the future of the national cigarette industry is really unthinkable.

### Why Can't Domestic Cigarettes Sell Better Than Foreign Cigarettes?

Why can foreign cigarettes sell so well in the domestic market? In short, they are cheap and good. Now almost everyone knows that the cost of living abroad is far cheaper than in China. In fact, not only that, foreign manufacturers are large in scale, have a long history, sophisticated technology, complete equipment, rich experience, and sufficient capital, which are all things that domestic factories cannot compare with. In fact, in today's China, with the civil war not yet stopped, transportation unable to recover, currency inflation, the cost of living rising day by day, and labor unrest occurring frequently, if the government does not take effective protective policies, it is not only the cigarette industry, but any national industry will not be able to survive.

Now, please compare the production costs of domestic and foreign cigarettes as follows:

The general American cigarettes sold on the market recently, with the most exquisite decorations, and the tobacco silk used is only slightly lower than the few best American cigarettes, such as Marlboro and Camel, are priced at only US$1.88 per thousand cigarettes, and US$94 per 50,000 cigarettes (the above is for delivery in New York). If delivered in Shanghai, the price per thousand cigarettes is US$2.06, and the price per 50,000 cigarettes is US$103. That is, according to the popular 50,000 cigarette packing in Shanghai, the price per box is only about 210,000 yuan in legal currency. If you add all kinds of taxes of about 247%, the price is about 740,000 yuan in legal currency.

Then, take the price of British cigarettes, which are quite similar in quality to the canned Three Castles cigarettes, for analysis: the price per box is about 400,000 yuan in legal currency (50,000 cigarettes per box), plus various taxes of 247%, totaling 1,390,000 yuan in legal currency. However, for domestic cigarettes in paper packaging, such as Beauty Brand, the price per 50,000 cigarettes is 1,300,000 yuan, and the difference in quality and decoration compared with this canned British cigarette is of course extremely large.

Further, if a Shanghai domestic cigarette factory wants to manufacture a cigarette with the same decoration quality as American-made Marlboro and Camel cigarettes, its cost must be as follows:

(1) Raw materials and decorations

Tobacco leaves 135 pounds (calculated at 2,000 yuan per pound) equals 270,000 yuan

Cigarette paper 20,000 yuan

Steel refined paper 10,000 yuan

Trademark 45,000 yuan

Outer packaging transparent paper 70,000 yuan

Large cardboard box (strip box) 15,000 yuan

Outer sealing paper for large cardboard box 1,800 yuan

Wooden box 8,000 yuan

Equals 439,800 yuan

(2) Manufacturing costs

Fuel 5,000 yuan

Electric power 420 yuan

Glue 2,000 yuan

Management fees 30,000 yuan

Tobacco leaf tearing wages 8,000 yuan

Cigarette packaging wages 24,000 yuan

Equals 69,420 yuan

The total is 509,220 yuan

According to the current regulations on goods tax, cigarette tax must be 100% of the value, so if the factory price needs to be 510,000 yuan, a tax of 510,000 yuan must be paid. In other words, if the selling price of American cigarettes is 740,000 yuan, the selling price of domestic cigarettes (of the same quality) must be at least 1,020,000 yuan. The difference is as much as 280,000 yuan, but if you want the decoration to be exactly the same as American goods, it is technically impossible.

If domestic manufacturers cut prices to compete, each box will be sold at the same price as American goods, 740,000 yuan. According to the current tax system, each box should pay a tax of 344,200 yuan in legal currency (calculated based on "selling price = factory price + 100% goods tax + 15% freight"), and the factory will receive a net of 395,800 yuan in legal currency. If the cost per box is 510,000 yuan, each box will lose more than 110,000 yuan in legal currency.

From this point of view, the current import tax system for foreign cigarettes has not yet fully fulfilled the duties and functions of protecting tariffs. Under this tax system, the national cigarette industry will have no possibility of competing with foreign cigarettes.

Then, where does the total tax of 247% added to the various taxes on foreign cigarette imports come from?

The various taxes on American cigarette imports are as follows:

Cargo price (C.I.F) + 10% (all miscellaneous fees from strict transportation from the ship to the distributor)

Tariff 80% (cargo price + 10%)

The total various taxes paid = approximately 247% (cargo price)

In summary, we should know that the tax system for foreign cigarette imports is a combination of various parallel taxes. The domestic cigarette tax system initially seems to be more burdensome than foreign cigarettes, that is, 100% of the value is taxed (foreign cigarettes must be taxed 247% of the value). However, this tax system is a tax-on-tax system. Raw materials such as tobacco leaves in our cigarette factories have already been taxed before they are made into cigarettes (according to the current tobacco leaf tax, 30% of the value is levied on tobacco leaves planted in this country, and 41% of the value must be levied on imported tobacco leaves from foreign countries). None of the other raw materials are not taxed early, plus the business tax and stamp tax for each raw material, in total, each factory has already paid more than a dozen taxes before they are made into cigarettes. And the current goods tax is 100% of the value after these many taxes have been levied. Therefore, in fact, the amount of tax paid by domestic cigarettes is heavier than that of foreign cigarettes. According to the current method of taxing domestic cigarettes, foreign cigarettes should be taxed as follows to be fair:

(Imported cargo price + tariff) Tax 100% of the value

Although cigarettes are consumables, foreign countries do not levy as heavy taxes as China. For example, the United States does not tax tobacco leaves. Their manufacturers only pay cigarette tax; the British tax system only levies import tax on tobacco leaves; the British tax system only levies import tax on tobacco leaves, and does not tax cigarettes produced in their own country. And their cigarette export taxes are all tax-free. China charges tax on manufactured cigarettes, and tobacco leaves, whether they are domestically produced or imported, are all taxed.

Chinese national cigarette manufacturers should pay attention as soon as possible that they cannot survive independently. If they still cannot abandon their prejudices and form a strong joint operating organization to cope with the serious situation in the future, otherwise the foundation that has been worked hard for for several years today will eventually be completely destroyed.

### Talking About Tobacco From Past to Present

Cigarettes can be said to be the most common pastime in the world. Chinese people, very early on, had the habit of smoking domestic tobacco such as green strips and leather silk. Holding a water pipe in their hands, casually talking with family members, relatives, and friends, accompanied by a cup of tea, was a symbol of the leisurely life of the old Chinese times. After that, with the opening of trade between China and foreign countries, cigarettes also came to China. In order to prevent leakage and restore the rights, the Chinese also widely planted tobacco domestically and set up factories to manufacture it. After twenty or thirty years of struggle, it has established a considerable scale in China, which is lagging behind in industry. If our country can be self-sufficient in the tobacco industry, it may also have a significant impact on China's economic life.

Now we will introduce some knowledge about tobacco in the following.

Let's first talk about the history of tobacco. According to general saying, the habit of smoking tobacco,

### Originated in the Americas

And then spread to all parts of the world. In November 1492, Columbus's expedition team arrived in Cuba and discovered that the local natives used a long pipe inserted in their mouths, and the other end burned a kind of grass, and sucked the smoke into their stomachs. After that, the American continent was gradually developed, and explorers gradually discovered that the habit of smoking tobacco was extremely common there, and its history was long, and it was almost impossible to trace back to what year and what day it began.

Everyone knows that the English word for tobacco is Tobacco, but the origin of this word does not seem to originate from the original name of this plant. In the past, residents of Santo Domingo used a Y-shaped tube to smoke tobacco, with two ends plugged into the nostrils and the other end lit with tobacco. This tube was called Tabaco locally, and the English name for tobacco may have evolved from this word. However, some people also say that Mexico had previously called the plant tobacco Tabacco.

As for tobacco being brought to Europe, it was brought by Fernandez in 1558. He was a doctor.

King Philip II of Spain sent him to Mexico to investigate products. The first person to bring tobacco seeds to Europe was Nico, the French ambassador to Portugal. In order to commemorate his achievements, the scientific name of tobacco is called Nicotiana. At that time, people generally believed that tobacco had miraculous effects in treating diseases. The great British poet Spenser called tobacco "divine grass" in his poems. Later, with the advocacy of Lord Raleigh, the habit of smoking tobacco became popular among the courtiers of various European countries. In the mid-17th century, the sales of tobacco spread like wildfire, and it was almost a household item.

In order to increase the sales of tobacco, the business of planting tobacco leaves in various countries is expanding day by day. At present, the most famous tobacco-producing countries in the world are the United States and Turkey. In addition, countries in Central and South America, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, and various parts of Southeast Asia also produce tobacco. In China, Henan and Guangxi are the most famous places for producing tobacco. The local climate and soil are suitable for planting tobacco. If scientific methods can be used to improve it in the future, there will definitely be a better harvest. This is something that domestic cigarette entrepreneurs should pay attention to.

### Chemical Composition

As for the chemical composition of unfermented and fermented tobacco, there are slight differences in nature, which are roughly as follows:

Unfermented Fermented

(Percentage) (Percentage)

Water 23.50 23.40

Ash 14.89 15.27

Nicotine 2.50 1.79

Nitric acid (N2O5) 1.89 1.79

The quality of tobacco is better the older it is. The longer the time, the more mellow and less fiery the tobacco taste. However, fermentation can also improve the taste of tobacco, and various spices can also be added. If the combination is appropriate, the taste can of course be more wonderful. In order to seek the best sales of domestic cigarettes, efforts must be made to achieve excellence in manufacturing, so that the tobacco taste is fragrant and the quality is consistent. This is really a matter that manufacturers cannot ignore.

In a world where commercial competition is very fierce, the survival of the fittest is still the most basic axiom. In order to preserve our country's cigarette market and to preserve the lifeline of our country's industry, Chinese manufacturers must catch up as soon as possible, especially for the Chinese people's preferences in tobacco taste, they must spend more effort, so that they can achieve the purpose of Chinese people smoking Chinese cigarettes.

### Addicted to Smoking

During the Spanish Civil War, Madrid was besieged for a very long time, and transportation to the outside world was completely cut off. The Spanish are addicted to smoking, and under such circumstances, the supply of tobacco has become a major problem. Anyone who has the habit of smoking cigarettes can imagine the suffering of the people of Madrid. At that time, several American reporters were specially authorized by the authorities to come to the city of Madrid. Their purpose was nothing more than to gather news, so they often walked on the streets. Soon they found that people were often following them, and they were greatly surprised, thinking that there were spies investigating their actions, but after a long time, the truth was finally revealed. It turned out that these people were waiting for the Americans to throw away the remaining cigarette butts, wanting to use them to get a puff!

### Lord Raleigh

The habit of smoking tobacco was completely unknown to Europeans before the 15th century. During the reign of Queen Elizabeth of England, he was a very prestigious figure in the court. One day, he somehow got some good tobacco, and sat alone in the room, smoking it greatly, looking very leisurely. At that time, a servant ran in from outside, fearing that the master had any instructions, and no one was serving him. But it was okay not to go in, but when he went in and saw the master's situation of swallowing clouds and spitting fog, it made him jump up, immediately turned around and ran away, and brought a bucket of water, and poured it straight on the master, constantly shouting: "No, no, the master's stomach is on fire..."

### Using This "Ode to Fathers"
### In Commemoration of the August 8th Father's Day
### A Father's Sense of Responsibility

— Kang Dun

Generally, fathers naturally hope their children will fulfill their filial duties. However, fathers themselves must constantly reflect on whether they have truly fulfilled their paternal duties. Here is a common example:

I have a female relative whom I hadn't seen in a long time. Seven or eight years ago, she married a man who was twenty years older than her. I asked her, "Is he a widower?" "No." "Then, with your talent and beauty, how could you marry a husband so much older?" "Speaking of this, I have to blame my father. My father is a businessman, and his marriage to my mother was originally very happy. But since my mother gave birth to my sister and me, I often saw my father mistreating my mother upon his return from indulging himself outside the home. If they disagreed, he would resort to physical violence. He also didn't care about our daughters' education, so I, a daughter from a middle-class family, dropped out of school early. Seeing all my father's faults and my mother's daily mental suffering, I resolved that if I married, I would only marry a man older than me, with a kind nature, who would allow me to take care of my mother in her old age. Although there were many suitors, I finally married this man who met my requirements eight years ago...I sacrificed myself and lowered my standards because my father failed to fully fulfill his duties as a husband, and to ensure my mother's happiness in her later years."

"Do you plan to do anything for Father's Day?"

"I don't plan to do anything. I only have one hope: that fathers will not repeat the mistakes of my father."

She then told me about her friend's father, how he loved his daughter and treated his wife well, describing it so vividly that it almost brought me to tears.

I believe all human relationships should be reciprocal. The kind of one-sided filial piety shown by Yu Shun to his parents is truly rare.

In a society like Shanghai, with its extreme extravagance and frivolity, men always hope that women will be "virtuous wives and good mothers" and that children will be "filial sons and virtuous daughters," yet they don't restrain themselves from being "loyal husbands and benevolent fathers." How can children wholeheartedly celebrate this "Father's Day" without any regrets?

### Father's Day, Father Anxious

— Qi Cha

August 8th is Father's Day.

As a father, one has to rack one's brains over the children's education expenses. Relatives and friends congratulate you on having a family, truly a joy of family life. But, "raising without teaching is the father's fault," August will pass in the blink of an eye, and school will start again. Where will one find such a large sum for tuition and fees?

Father's Day, father anxious!

"Everyone has a father, everyone should commemorate Father's Day; commemorating one's father is the starting point of being a person." This is the slogan revealed by the Father's Day Promotion Committee.

I wonder what the children of traitors think when they see this?

It's like when the presiding judge sentenced Wang Wen-ti, he earnestly advised him, "You should learn from the first half of your father's life, but never follow the second half."

If Father's Day can make people reflect on themselves, that is the most noble meaning of Father's Day.

### The Psychology of Shanghai People

— Jin Lu

—Starting with the "Charity Dance"—

After the "charity dance," the North Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association has another method of electing a "Miss Shanghai" to help with disaster relief. For the "lives" of the three million refugees in North Jiangsu, we naturally strongly support the methods used by the gentlemen of the relief association after racking their brains, as long as they can raise more money and save more lives. There is nothing to say.

However, after seeing the "dancing girl" charity dance and the election of "Miss Shanghai," we can't help but think about "the psychology of Shanghai people." Why use these two "grand events" for this disaster relief instead of charity sales of calligraphy and paintings by famous people, ancient and modern? It is obvious that this is for the sake of the psychology of Shanghai people. In fact, one cannot deny their cleverness and hard work.

Shanghai people are ultimately the most clever and realistic. They like to do things that achieve two goals at once, gaining both fame and profit. They prefer to enjoy rights without fulfilling obligations. They are determined not to spend money for nothing; they must receive a corresponding return for their money. Previous charity performances and charity fees had advertisements that said: "Not only can you feast your eyes, but it is also a disaster relief good deed, achieving two things at once, why not do it! Come and enjoy!" This charity dance did not have a similar advertisement, but it can be drafted as follows: "Not only can you embrace a slender waist, but it is also a beautiful disaster relief good deed..." Indeed, Shanghai people have grown up under this mask of "the drinker's heart is not in the wine."

Immediately following the "charity dance" was the "fraud of 700,000 yuan," which was a truly genuine "fraud." The "fraud disease" has recently become popular in Shanghai, spreading like an epidemic. It is both sad and lamentable, making people laugh and cry!

I remember one Mid-Autumn Festival evening after "August 13th," someone was "raising their head to look at the bright moon, lowering their head to eat mooncakes." Every time they took a bite of mooncake, they thought of a lost territory in the Northeast; after taking another bite, they thought of another lost territory. Finally, after eating the mooncake and wiping their mouth, they said, "Alas! Our great mulberry leaves will also be eaten up by silkworms!" I truly admire this person's good appetite and their ability to be leisurely in the midst of sorrow, which is incomprehensible and makes me prostrate myself in admiration.

Using money earned from merely satisfying personal desires to help with disaster relief is not a good method! Because giving sympathy and aid mixed with deep grief in happiness is morbid and untrue. At the same time, this kind of behavior that does not stem from the sympathy of human mutual aid is fragile and temporary. Their purpose is not disaster relief; they are just spending a little money to make themselves happy. They rarely know why people in North Jiangsu are displaced? They have long forgotten the serious disasters in Hunan, Henan, Guangdong, and Guangxi. They are truly "unaware of the Han, let alone the Wei and Jin!"

Therefore, Shanghai people should quickly change this playful, morbid mentality completely, the sooner the better. At the same time, based on the natural instinct of human mutual aid, they should provide aid automatically and without expecting repayment, contributing their strength and money. Then, this method of using the happiness of a few people to earn money for disaster relief will no longer be valued, and we will no longer see the kind of disharmonious advertisement in the newspaper that says: "Dance one more dance, save one more life!"

Think about it, where and what kind of people would have the following letter?

### Letter to Father Comrade

— Suo Bei

Father Comrade ××:

We are clearly not satisfied with the family you lead! In terms of blood, you are our direct "parent," but in terms of the organization of the family, you are our public servant. Your service to us is equal to our service to your third generation. Based on the interests of the entire family collective, we have very sufficient reasons and rights to ask you to note: we cannot and will not continue to remain silent about your incompetence and reaction. We have already decided by an absolute majority to abolish your leadership of the family from this day forward. In other words, internally you should hand over economic power, and externally you cannot represent our family! See the attached memorandum for detailed measures.

You must pay attention: "The minority obeys the majority, the individual obeys the organization!" We have the right to order you to accept decisions passed through democratic means! If this decision cannot be accepted, we will consider holding a family congress, which has the right to publicly try any reactionary elements who undermine family democracy!

You obviously do not understand our behavior in terms of "" and therefore interfere unreasonably. We have repeatedly protested strongly, please stop this unfriendly and hostile attitude and cancel the economic blockade! But you openly despise our protests. We believe that sexual behavior is purely a personal matter, and we have full rights to handle it. We believe that family finances should be open, and we have the joint right to dispose of your income; but due to your innate stubbornness and acquired backwardness, our rights and interests are not guaranteed! For the sake of human rights, we five siblings and your wife specially notify you jointly: please implement the measures proposed in the memorandum within forty-eight hours! We will try our best to implement these measures in a peaceful manner!

We will not consider renegotiating with you, because there are irreconcilable contradictions between you and us!

For the sake of family peace and unity, democracy and freedom, we announce: our "Siblings Family Protection Committee" will immediately exercise the ruling power of the family! Greetings to the liberation of the family! August 8th

Family Protection Committee

### Calling "Papa"

— Luo Tingze

The American soldier, weary from the war and having stayed in Europe for thirty-two months, rushed to a nearby public telephone station as soon as he set foot on the territory of his homeland, excitedly calling his wife. At the same time, he was equally, perhaps even more, eager to hear his son's voice. When he left home, the child couldn't speak yet; now, according to his mother's letters, the child was three years old and learning to speak.

He waited for the connection with great tension, and then, very excitedly, he heard his wife's long-lost voice, which then stopped. After a long pause, he heard the muffled sound of his child picking up the phone. But nothing—the child didn't say a word.

"That's Papa, honey, you know?" his mother said. "Say 'Hello, Papa.'"

The child didn't say anything.

"Say it! Hello," his mother urged.

But it remained quiet.

The child's mother tried again and again to get the child to say it with her, but she couldn't. So she tried one last trick to coax him to speak. "Honey, say 'Hello' to Papa. I'll buy you candy in return."

After a long time, the long-waiting Papa finally heard his child's one sentence: "Mommy, what kind of candy?"

### Father (Part 1)

— Ge Chunliang

A True Story

I fell silent.

Alas! How could I answer?

Father continued to ask, "Liang, are you planning to go to school or go into business?"

It was still that earnest, sincere voice piercing straight into my heart.

Alas! Who would want to be a money-grubbing merchant?

Turning around, I saw my innocent and carefree younger siblings playing. Furthermore, I saw my loving mother's worried eyes, full of hope, watching me, waiting for my answer.

Suddenly, I remembered the difficulties of paying tuition. The hope of entering university grew dim. Finally, I blurted out these words from between my teeth: "Let's do business!"

In the deep of night, I hugged my pillow and wept.

However, I also realized my own selfishness. Father had put in so much effort to raise me, of course he hoped that I would help him support the family.

Moreover, he had suffered a lot for us, especially the embarrassing cold looks he received when borrowing money at the end of the semester. Whenever I thought of the difficulties Father had in raising tuition fees, the past appeared before my eyes like a silver screen.

The year before last, during a summer vacation, I followed Father to a car dealership. Father didn't tell me the reason for going there beforehand, and I didn't ask.

Perhaps because I wasn't interested in what the car dealership manager and Father were saying, I didn't hear everything, but I always remembered a few words.

That man pointed at me and said, "How is he doing in school?"

"Because he's still considered smart, I wanted him to graduate from middle school. I wanted to ask you to help..."

The man interrupted Father before he could finish speaking, "Let this kind of person go into business! There's no use in studying." Contempt and disdain overflowed in his words.

"It's very difficult to find a job these days..."

"I myself have been very short on money lately, and business isn't very good, so I can't..." A layer of somewhat mocking laughter floated on his face, and he muttered behind him, "If you can't afford to study, what's the point of letting him study? Trying to save face!"

I looked up at Father and saw him clenching his teeth.

Last year, Father was unemployed at home, but relying on his abilities, our family of nine did not go hungry. You must know that it is very difficult to gain a foothold in this world, especially for someone who is illiterate. But even though Father was illiterate, he supported this group who only knew how to open their mouths to eat.

It was also during the summer vacation, I think, that I was going to take the scholarship exam. Father tried his best to stop me. He said he would find a way to pay the tuition. In order not to make Father run around in the scorching sun, I finally joined the scholarship exam.

In the end, I failed!

I couldn't help but laugh all day, but Father came to comfort me.

I realized the reason why Father stopped me. He knew I wouldn't pass, and he didn't want me to be hurt.

I am deeply grateful for his hard work.

Someone came to Father and said that he would be willing to provide Father with money. If Father could go to work for him, no, to become an "official," a puppet official, a lucrative position as a "puppet bureau chief" was waiting for him to take office.

Father refused immediately before the man could finish speaking.

Father said that if he did this kind of thing, although we would have tuition fees, we would not be able to gain a foothold in society in the future.

As for himself, he was absolutely unwilling to compromise, but he said that he would never let his children be called "the sons of traitors" no matter what.

Father said that even if our family was starving to death, we should not wave the white flag.

Later, on the day before school started, Father gave me money and ordered me to pay the tuition. He said, "Child, you have to work hard! Take this money to pay the tuition, remember! This money was earned by very legitimate means, and I can say that this money is very sacred."

I respectfully agreed and went to pack my school supplies, preparing to go to school. Just as I was about to leave, Father stopped me and said softly, "Child, you must listen to your mother, because this money was exchanged for your mother's only possession and her only beloved jewelry."

### Don't Forget the Founding Father

— Xin Fang

"There is a family after there is a country."

When commemorating "Father's Day," of course, we cannot forget the father who gave birth to and raised us.

However, for all descendants of the great Republic of China, in addition to having a father of their own, we must not forget Mr. Sun Yat-sen, who created the Republic of China. He is the founding father of the Republic of China, and can also be said to be the father of every Chinese citizen. When we commemorate our own father, we must not forget the founding father's instructions. There is a family after there is a country. If we keep this sentence in mind, then the meaning of "Father's Day" is even greater.
