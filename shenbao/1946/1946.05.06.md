[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] The grand ceremony for the National Government's return to the capital and the anniversary of the founding of the revolutionary government was solemnly held at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum at 9:00 AM on the 5th. Chairman Chiang led the rituals and delivered an address after paying respects at the mausoleum, urging the nation with eight points: (1) abstain from wastefulness, (2) value frugality, (3) eliminate selfishness, (4) eradicate arrogance and deceit, (5) uphold propriety and righteousness, (6) know integrity and shame, (7) take responsibility, and (8) abide by discipline. The words were earnest and hit the nail on the head, deeply moving all who heard them.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] The celebration ceremony for the return of the National Government to the capital and the anniversary of the founding of the revolutionary government was held jointly at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum at 9:00 AM on the 5th, marking the largest grand ceremony since the victory of the War of Resistance. Around 8:00 AM, over 5,000 civil and military officials and representatives of the people arrived one after another, lined up on both sides of the stone steps at the entrance of the memorial hall, civil officials on the right and military officials on the left, their ranks neat. Overlooking the winding mausoleum avenue, countless national flags fluttered in the wind amidst a green sea of pines and cypresses, beautiful and solemn, fully symbolizing the glorious triumphant return of our central government. At 9:00 AM sharp, Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, arrived amidst enthusiastic applause. The Chairman wore a new army uniform of a Special-Grade General, adorned with medals, while the wife wore a black wool coat, frequently nodding and returning greetings to the participants. After entering the memorial hall, the grand ceremony began. Amidst the high strains of military music and the booming of 101 gun salutes, the Chairman took his place, sang the national anthem, and offered flowers. Zhang Daofan then respectfully read the proclamation. The Chairman then led the ritual as before, and the entire assembly observed three minutes of silence in front of the portrait of the Father of the Nation, as well as the national army and allied soldiers who died in the War of Resistance, and the compatriots who perished. Afterwards, he led the members of the Central Standing Committee, members of the National Government, heads of various ministries and commissions, and representatives of the Presidium of the Political Participation Council in a procession into the mausoleum, circling the mausoleum once, completing the ceremony. Stepping out of the memorial hall, the Chairman delivered a speech at the entrance to the participants, recalling the historical traces of eight years of suffering and pointing out the direction of future efforts, which lasted for five minutes. After the speech, he stepped down the stone steps with his wife, and all those who attended the ceremony followed and shouted softly, the echoes reverberating in the Purple-Gold Mausoleum Valley for a long time. Furthermore, the National Government's flag-raising ceremony was moved to the capital from the 5th onwards.

### Chairman Addresses the Nation, Urging All Compatriots to Remember the Lessons of History and Cooperate Sincerely to Preserve the Glorious Fruits of Our Final Victory

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] Chairman Chiang attended the capital's celebration of the return to the capital on the 5th and delivered an address to the nation. The original text is as follows: "Fellow countrymen, soldiers, and civilians across the nation, today is the anniversary of the founding of the revolutionary government in Guangzhou by our Founding Father 25 years ago, and our National Government has also returned to Nanjing today. For eight years, we resisted Japan, relying on the consistent unity of our compatriots, supporting the national policy of resistance, obeying the central government's orders, persevering through setbacks, fighting bravely, sacrificing blood, and enduring hardships, finally achieving today's final victory, and abolishing all unequal treaties, washing away the century-old national humiliation of our Chinese nation. Today, Zhongzheng and our compatriots can still meet in the capital, gathering together, which is truly gratifying and truly the most memorable day in our Republic of China. However, recalling the tragedy of the Nanjing Massacre when the capital fell on December 13, 1937, we should learn from the pain and never forget the enslavement, the life of beasts of burden, the dark and hopeless existence we endured under the enemy's iron heel for eight years. We must be vigilant and strive to be self-reliant and self-strengthening. In particular, the national shame and humiliation of the September 18th Incident fifteen years ago, when Northeast Shenyang was invaded, should be deeply remembered as a permanent historical lesson for our Chinese nation for generations to come. Compatriots, so today the government returns to the capital, I believe it can only be seen as marking the end of our War of Resistance against Japan, that is, the national policy of our National Government to resist to the end, leading all soldiers and civilians to sacrifice and struggle to achieve a victory. But even though we have recovered Shenyang today, the integrity of the entire administration and sovereignty of the Northeast still requires all our compatriots to cooperate sincerely for the country and the nation, continuing to work hard to preserve the glorious fruits of our final victory. Only in this way can we comfort the spirits of the soldiers, civilians, and compatriots who sacrificed for the War of Resistance and the revolution in the past eight years. The National Government will continue to uphold the teachings of the Founding Father and the consistent spirit of the National Revolution, always leading our soldiers, civilians, and compatriots across the nation to move forward, realize the Three Principles of the People, and complete the mission of resisting Japan and building the nation. I hope that our compatriots across the nation can still use the confidence of certain victory in the past War of Resistance to shoulder the great cause of certain success in building the nation in the future. However, our compatriots across the nation should thoroughly recognize that the work of building the nation is more arduous and painful than the War of Resistance. However, although our work of building the nation is arduous, the national will is completely free, so our life of building the nation, though bitter, is still joyful. In short, amidst the victory and return to the capital with joyful cheers, reflecting on the past and thinking about the present, we feel even more the difficulty of achieving victory and the preciousness of the opportunity to build the nation. I hope that all our compatriots will unite with one heart and one mind, be pragmatic and realistic, and everyone will be committed to hard work, endurance, and practical action, encouraging each other with common unity and mutual assistance, so that our Chinese nation, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, will never again suffer the tragedy and humiliation of foreign invasion and trampling like the past eight years. Therefore, I would like to make a few special requests to my compatriots today to serve as our common and consistent guiding principles for building the nation: (1) We must abstain from wastefulness, (2) We must value frugality, (3) We must uphold propriety and righteousness, (4) We must know integrity and shame, (5) We must take responsibility, and (6) We must abide by discipline. My wife and I are truly ashamed to receive such warm welcome and support from our compatriots today. We are deeply afraid of failing to live up to the expectations of our compatriots. We can only use the spirit of the past War of Resistance, be vigilant morning and night, follow all our compatriots, and support the National Government to build a new China that is unified, independent, equal, free, prosperous, strong, and happy, to fulfill the ultimate meaning of the support of our compatriots across the nation. I respectfully wish all soldiers and civilians across the nation a long life for the victory of the War of Resistance." Furthermore, on the afternoon of the 5th, the day of the National Government's return to the capital, Chairman Chiang personally went to the Central Broadcasting Station at 8:00 PM to broadcast the address he delivered at the capital's celebration of the return to the capital that morning to the soldiers, civilians, and compatriots across the nation to inspire them.

### Madame Zhou Enlai Pays Respects to the Chairman

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] At the National Government's reception on the afternoon of the 5th, Deng Yingchao, Madame Zhou Enlai, a representative of the Chinese Communist Party, said after paying respects to the Chairman that Mr. Zhou had gone to Hankou this morning and could not come to offer congratulations. The Chairman repeatedly said thank you and said that he had received the news that Zhou and General Xu Yongchang had gone to Hankou, and he looked very pleased when he said it.

### Central Government to Hold Expanded Commemoration Week This Morning

The Executive Yuan to Draft Thrift Plan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] The first expanded commemoration week of the central government after returning to the capital is scheduled to be held at the National Government at 9:00 AM on the 6th. Chairman Chiang has decided to personally preside over it and will issue important instructions to the personnel returning to the capital.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] The Executive Yuan has decided to hold its first formal meeting after returning to the capital on Tuesday this week (the 7th). It is reported that President Zhu will personally preside over the meeting and discuss all the policies of reform and innovation of various ministries and commissions after returning to the capital, and also explore the formulation of plans based on Chairman Chiang's frugal instructions, urging governments at all levels to act thriftily.

### Various Circles in Wuhan Urge Suppression of Internal Turmoil

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 5th Dispatch] All students of various levels of schools in Wuhan, due to the stubbornness and unyieldingness of the Communist army, have recently published a letter to Chairman Chiang, urging him to make a decisive decision to suppress internal turmoil.

### Citizens of the Capital Present a Brocade Banner and a Volume of Odes Welcoming the Return of the National Government

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] After the capital's celebration of the return to the capital on the 5th, the citizens presented Chairman Chiang with a brocade banner and a volume of odes respectfully welcoming the return of the National Government. According to the item's odes, it was drafted by Lu Jiye and inscribed by Huang Zhen. The full text is as follows: "On May 5, 35th year of the Republic of China, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government triumphantly returns to the capital. The spirits and wind and rain carry the Mao Jie eastward, the scholars and women of the capital await the westward arrival of the imperial carriage. We dance and sing, praising him. The key to the northern gate was destroyed in ordinary times, the beacon smoke of the southern country was set off at dawn and dusk. The Japanese warlords harbored evil intentions and accumulated plans for piecemeal encroachment, trying to indulge in whale-like annexation. Our Chairman, in a sudden rage, followed the wind, through hundreds of battles, finally thwarted their edge. The foundation of the country is forever solid, the glory of the nation is far-reaching. Turning the universe around, rebuilding China, enemies and external troubles are endless in history. Many examples of Southern Expeditions and Northern Expeditions have been set before. However, making the strong surrender and willingly prostrate themselves, avenging nine generations of hatred with eight years of effort, is truly rare in ancient times as it is today. Chairman's Qianmo is unique, and the Miao calculation is flawless. In addition to continuing efforts, the plans from the east to the west were determined, and finally our rivers and mountains were returned, and the sun and moon were restored. This is unprecedented since the birth of the people. The central government in Bashu, looking east at the mountains and rivers, is lost in the sea, and returning west to the clouds and trees, is separated by wind and smoke. Our scholars and people in the southeast, responding to Chairman's appeal, worry about the rise and fall of the world, and have no regrets after nine deaths. Ten thousand families endure the pain. Although they have been poisoned by tea, they are still loyal. Fortunately, the rocks and borders of the four seas finally returned to the territory. The elders of Sanwu restored our clothes. Seeing that the War of Resistance has been won, we look forward to the inevitable success of nation-building. Although the northern lands still yearn for the banners, we believe that these people will surely ascend the mats together. We will see that Anle is strong and solid, safer than golden soup, and blessings, longevity, health, and peace are stronger than pine and cypress. Who sings the ode to the return to the capital, borrowing the sincerity of expressing virtue."

### Guests Gather in the National Government Auditorium: Chairman Chiang and His Wife Hold a Tea Reception; Soviet Ambassador Arrives Early, Marshall is Full of Joy

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] The most lively program in the celebration of the return to the capital, the "May 5th Tea Party," was held in the National Government Auditorium at 4:30 PM. Ambassadors from various countries, heads of various ministries and commissions, members of the Central Committee, and senators all received invitations jointly signed by the Chairman and his wife. Each guest was given a round red guest pass. Mr. and Mrs. Marshall arrived at 4:20 PM. Marshal was full of joy and very interested in the magnificent architecture of the National Government. Before signing his name, he and his wife looked around the corridor with red pillars in front of the auditorium, laughing constantly. Marshal was wearing a grass-green wool military uniform, and his wife was wearing a light brown Western suit with light yellow leather shoes and a tea flower of red and yellow colors on her hat. Soviet Ambassador Petrov and his wife arrived early. The guests shook hands and chatted in the lounge and corridor. At that time, a certain gentleman from the Chairman's office, who was familiar with the reporter, told the reporter that the Chairman wanted to browse the Shanghai newspapers, and the reporter handed over a copy of the Shenbao in his bag to be forwarded to the Chairman. This was the first Shanghai newspaper that the Chairman read on the day of the grand ceremony of returning to the capital. At 4:30 PM, the Chairman and his wife stepped out of the lounge and entered the auditorium amidst military music. The guests followed in a single file. Long tables were set up on all four sides of the auditorium, filled with refreshments. Waiters served lemon black tea, and military music continued to accompany the grand event. The Chairman stood in front of the long table in the center of the venue, with Petrov on the left and President Song on the right. The Chairman's wife and Marshall's wife sat around a round table, while Marshall stood against the wall between the two ladies. The sound of their loud laughter could be heard constantly in the auditorium. Personnel from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs introduced military attachés and counselors from various embassies to the Chairman. Afterwards, the Chairman also walked to the round table surrounded by Marshall and had a conversation. Forty minutes later, the Chairman and his wife bid farewell to the guests and walked out of the auditorium amidst applause from everyone. The guests continued to have tea and snacks until about 5:00 PM, when this grand tea party ended happily.

### Communist Army in Dongjiang Has Not Yet Agreed to Withdraw; Guangdong is Still Actively Reorganizing its Army; Zhang Fakui Reports on the Work of the Headquarters

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 5th Dispatch] Zhang Fakui, Director of the Guangzhou Headquarters, held a cocktail party at the Headquarters' official residence yesterday (the 4th) to entertain reporters and report on the recent and future work of the Headquarters.

Severe Food Shortage

Director Zhang first reported on the current serious food shortage in Guangdong Province, saying in brief: "The current food shortage is actually even more severe than in 1942. However, in the past, the military food burden was too heavy, which affected the lack of civilian food. Therefore, before April 1, all Japanese prisoners, Japanese residents, and Korean residents were transported away. Now the military food has been reduced from 130,000 large packages to 6,500 large packages. Reducing military food can increase civilian food."

Communist Army in Dongjiang

Next, he talked about the withdrawal of the Dongjiang Communist armed personnel. He had consulted with the representatives of the Communist Party of China in accordance with the three principles instructed by the Chairman and provided all assistance to them, sparing no effort to compromise in order to achieve peaceful unification. The Communist side has raised various trivial issues and has not yet agreed to leave. Now the American representatives are very frustrated, so he personally hopes that the Communist side can clearly express what they want.

Northeast Issue

Director Zhang also expressed his thoughts on the Northeast issue, saying: "The Northeast issue is no longer a problem between the government and the Communist Party of China, but an international issue. The Soviet army must wait for the Communist army to arrive before withdrawing from a place, and the Communist Party of China is strongly opposed to the United States assisting the National Army in transporting north. In fact, the National Army taking over the Northeast is a matter of course. The Communist Party of China's opposition is nothing more than trying to make the Northeast special and make it a fait accompli. Therefore, the Northeast may evolve into a second 'Manchukuo' in the future. This is a matter of national sovereignty, and we must not ignore it."

Army Reorganization

Director Zhang also talked about the Headquarters' work on army reorganization, which is being actively carried out. It has now been decided to start the reorganization from the 10th of this month and complete it by the end of June. It will first change the army into a division and then reduce the division to two brigades. It can be reduced by more than two-thirds before November. It can be seen that the government's implementation of military and political orders will have factual evidence. However, it is unknown whether the Communist Party will comply with the agreement to reduce the army, because there is no news of army reduction in the Communist Party's newspapers.

Future Work

Finally, Director Zhang reported on the future work of the Headquarters, saying: "The first is the reorganization and training of the army in the jurisdiction, the second is to supervise the local government to thoroughly purify history and governance, eliminate corruption, and do its best to relieve all the suffering of the people. I hope that the media will also take the responsibility of supervision."

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 5th Dispatch] Xu Yongchang, Zhou Enlai, and Bedell Smith, the US representative, arrived in Hankou from Beijing and Beiping at noon on the 5th and were entertained by Director Cheng Qian at a banquet in the evening and held talks. It is reported that the three will go to Xuanhuadian on the 6th to inspect. Zheng Shaowen, the representative of the Communist Party of China in Hankou, hosted the Wuhan Executive Group on the evening of the 5th.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] Xu Yongchang, the government representative of the three-person group, Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Communist Party of China, and Lu Tongsheng, the staff officer of the Communist Army, and Zhang Wenda, the translator, flew to Hankou by plane at 10:00 AM on the 5th. It is reported that they will meet with General Bedell Smith, the US representative, to investigate the actual situation in the conflict area in central Hubei around Xuanhuadian in order to mediate. Currently, both the government and the Communist Party of China claim that there are only small conflicts in central Hubei and no large-scale battles.

[Agence France-Presse, Beiping, 5th Dispatch] Brigadier General Bedell Smith, the head of the Executive Group of the Military Mediation Department, was urgently summoned by Envoy Marshall and flew to Hankou by plane on the morning of the 5th with two officials from the Reporting Headquarters and several representatives of the Executive Group.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 5th Dispatch] Zheng Shaowen, a senior staff officer of the Central Plains Military Region of the Communist Party of China, hosted a reception for reporters in Wuhan last night in the name of the spokesperson of the Communist Party of China in Hankou and made a speech, the general meaning of which was the same as that of the speech made by Lu Dingyi, the representative of the Communist Party of China, in Chongqing. He was eager to list the numbers of the National Army surrounding the Communist Army area of Xuanhuadian, in order to strengthen the seriousness of the conflict in northern Hubei, but after repeated calculations, he was unable to reach the number he claimed of "ten armies and twenty-six divisions." Even as he described, there was still a shortage of at least one army and two divisions. When the questioner asked, he could not explain himself, so he claimed: "There is another army number that has not yet received a formal report." A reporter then asked: "Is it a slight exaggeration that you are referring to ten armies and 200,000 people?" Zheng replied: "I also wish it were a real exaggeration, and I hope that this exaggeration will lead to peace." The whole place burst into laughter. Finally, Zheng listed the conflict locations in northern Hubei, elaborated on the strategic value of various places, and said in a stirring tone: "We certainly hope for peace, but we cannot put down our weapons. We have now decided to resolutely 'resist'." Between the lines, there was a lot of gunpowder. The locals and the public believe that this kind of exaggerated propaganda by the Communist Party of China is a consistent trick, obviously trying to undermine the ceasefire agreement to cover up the current military operations. Furthermore, the Wuhan Executive Group is scheduled to hold a meeting on the 6th to discuss mediation steps.

### Looking at the World and China from the Perspective of Agriculture

— Cheng Zhaoxiong

(I)

Generally, people's current understanding of world problems mostly focuses on economics, believing that the origins and trajectories of global issues can only be understood through the lens of economics. Both capitalism and socialism are products of economics, beginning and ending with it. Furthermore, large-scale, concentrated machine production is the defining economic characteristic of this era, simultaneously creating the diverse and complex nature of the modern world.

However, the solution to current global problems cannot disregard human nature. Social reform must involve institutional reform, which ultimately requires reform of human values. This so-called reform of human nature is, in fact, its revival. Only with the revival of human nature can there be spiritual awakening.

Who doesn't know that the current world is a material world? But when you affirm this material world, you must imbue it with spiritual meaning! This is what is meant by spiritual awakening.

Let cities become ruralized, and at the same time, let agriculture become industrialized. Ultimately, let everything possess the essence of the soil. In this way, one world after another will transform the world. Spiritual awakening and the revival of human nature are a new and good demand.

World problems are very complex, and Chinese problems are even more so. To understand Chinese problems, one should particularly focus on history and culture. The reason is simple: everyone knows that China is a nation with a unique history and culture.

China's success in becoming the China it is today relies on four conditions: first, Asia's unique geographical environment; second, agriculture; third, Chinese characters; and fourth, Confucianism. "Treat China as one person, and the world as one family"—even today, we cannot escape this harmful Confucian doctrine. "Understanding both internal and external principles, one can act appropriately according to the times"—Confucianism has always been useful to China and the world in imbuing material things with spiritual meaning. Focusing on culture should mean focusing on this.

Looking back, everyone knows that China's history is long and rich. But what about looking forward? Who can say it isn't also distant and vast? Focusing on history truly means nurturing idealism from history. We must promote idealism. China, at present, should be in a great era of idealism and should not be bogged down in shallow realism!

Speaking of solving Chinese problems, naturally we must focus on production in terms of economics. Production, scientific production, machine production—this is clearly the primary need in China.

Everyone says we need modernization; that's absolutely right. We need modernization; we desperately need modernization. Socially meaningful industrialization is truly a life-saving remedy for China, which has been groaning under the iron heel of capitalism for over a century. This means that China's modernization is the way for China to save and sustain itself, to renew and regenerate itself.

However, viewed from China's unique history and culture, China has a historical mission and a cultural mission. The historical mission is the ultimate realization of the idealism nurtured from Chinese history. The cultural mission is to imbue material things with spiritual meaning, or simply put, to infuse "matter" with "spirit." Tao Yuanming's poem reads: "The meaning of justice has left me for a long time, and few in the world seek truth; the eager old man of Lu, is trying to mend it and keep it pure." In this sense, we not only need modernization but also ultra-modernization, which is to surpass the West.

Industrialization, the decentralization of industry, the transplantation of industry into the countryside, and agriculture—industrialization, as well as garden cities, etc.—this is a series of ideals for us. If we can realize all of these things in reality, then this is ultra-modernization! Only in this way can we avoid being swallowed up by those rooted in nomadic peoples and perfected by industrial nations!

The atomic bomb has forced every country's defense plans and every country's production plans to undergo thorough changes! All our previous plans should also be revised!

The Chinese farmer problem, caused by the destruction of agriculture and the abuse of farmers, is the first problem we must solve. There are no more pitiable or admirable people in the world than Chinese farmers! When Mr. Gandhi fasted, the whole world paid great attention and extended great sympathy. But currently, in China, there must already be countless people who have long been like Gandhi! In this sense, we need modernization even more, and we need ultra-modernization even more.

In the sense of modernization, we need democracy, we need United Nations institutions, and we need an "ethical" society. But in the sense of ultra-modernization, I might as well say, we need centripetal democracy, cultural harmony, and an "ethical" society. Administration should be efficient and technical; life should be emotional and pastoral; scholarship should be humane and spiritual. We must oppose all political separatism, diplomatic dependency, and shallow utilitarianism!

What are we basing all this on? It is because we do not want to pursue the shadow of modern culture, nor do we want to be fascinated by the superficial beauty of modern civilization. We want industry, and we also want the industrialization of agriculture. We are people of a great era, and we must have new and good aspirations.

(II)

Currently, World War II has ended, the United Nations has triumphed, and we have also triumphed. But what happens after victory? Could victory be frightening?

The famous British general, the Duke of Wellington, after his great victory at the Battle of Waterloo, said:

"Except for a bad harvest, I know nothing more dreadful than a victory!"

But despite this, we continued our celebrations, constantly celebrating. We clearly know that things are different now. When things reach their limit, they change; when they change, they flow. Now, we should change and flow. The East is agricultural, and the East is also wise. Now, the world's eyes are fixed on the East, just as our eyes are fixed on the West. The East and the West will eventually be connected. Currently, the primary meaning of the West is the garden city, while we should be industrial villages. Otherwise, the destructive power of the atomic bomb will continue to develop without end, and it will be difficult to say what comes after victory.

We should always be clear that our future efforts cannot be separated from the path of "living simply, thinking brilliantly." Some unnecessary decadent living and some unnecessary empty thoughts should truly "go there, go there!" as Pushkin's poem says. Here, I would like to see rural development, globally oriented rural development, become a guarantee of victory in this war. And I feel that this is a good ending for good people!

Our ancestors once had a set of ideals and a set of methods that made China the only major power in Asia and also the only ancient nation remaining in the world. What were these ideals and methods? This is what is called "soldiers in agriculture."

But at present, this is no longer enough. We should add "learning in agriculture" and "industry in agriculture." We want to rely on a new scientific and industrialized agriculture to establish our agricultural tactics and agricultural defense in the atomic age.

The science of agriculture is the science of biology and the science of life.

The enterprise of agriculture is a peaceful enterprise and also a defensive enterprise.

If, from today onward, the world of humanity before was the world of physics and the world of war, then from now on, it should be the world of biology and life and the world of peace and defense.

Now the achievements of physical science have reached the stage of atomic energy, but the achievements of biological science have not yet allowed people to understand the ultimate realization of biology and the essence of life. Therefore, people's destruction of biology and life itself is more than enough, while their grasp of biology and life is insufficient. However, based on the achievements of physical science, it is imaginable that biological science will also make rapid progress in the future. The invention of the atomic bomb will be the intersection of the world of physics and the world of biology. Frankly speaking, the world cannot but change from now on.

Logically, the world from now on should be a world of peace. However, if you are overly optimistic, you may be wrong again. Because peace was once a beautiful legend, and today it is still just a clever plan! But, in any case, the world from now on will certainly be a world of defense.

In the world of biological science and the world of defense, current tactics and national defense must change. The basis of tactics and national defense is nothing more than the scale of production. Generally speaking, the larger the scale, the better. However, the large-scale, concentrated industrial production that people are currently attempting only provides a good target for atomic bombs from the perspective of war, and it is not necessarily very economical from the perspective of economics. The automobile magnate Henry Ford, one of the greatest industrialists in the modern world, once said: "Conventionally speaking, the establishment of a large factory is not economical," "Large-scale operations must be decentralized throughout the country to regularly seek to serve the public. This is not only to obtain the lowest cost but also for the sake of purchasing among the masses of producers."

However, the largest scale of production and operation can be formed in other ways. A famous French economist, Dupluois, once said: "Even the largest industrial organization can be composed of several independent, autonomous small organizations."

Based on the existing achievements of physical science, coupled with the possible achievements of biological science in the future, I believe that the industrialized scale of agricultural production will form a greater and better force than the current industrial power. With this greater and better force, we are qualified to appreciate a biological world, that is, a living world, a world "full of the movement of thunder and rain," a rich world that will not be poor, a world of lasting joy and eternal health!

Confucius said, "I want to remain silent," and also said, "What does Heaven say? The four seasons proceed, and the myriad things are born. What does Heaven say?" This world of "the four seasons proceeding and the myriad things being born" is forever illuminated by the sun, moon, and stars. Even if the sky is sometimes dim and the earth is sometimes dark, it will ultimately not detract from a kind of eternal light.

Life is not a machine. Saying that life is a machine is a misconception of modern humanity, an unfortunate misconception! Life is a "flow"—"Like this flow, never ceasing day and night!" This is most clearly seen in garden cities and industrial villages, in the world of gardens.

In agriculture and in the industrialization of agriculture, people will at least have one benefit, which is not losing life. We now need the science of life, and we now need the education of life even more!

We want industry, and we also want agriculture, the industrialization of agriculture, and garden cities.

"Clear skies and peaceful earth, a peaceful mind and righteous principles!" This will not be the sole achievement of modern industry; it will be the possible achievement of the industrialization of agriculture in the future, and the achievement of garden cities.

(III)

In the current world, we clearly know that we cannot be simple; if we are simple, we will live very difficult lives. But despite this, we must ultimately simplify; we must transform complexity into simplicity, using simplicity to manage complexity. We want material things, and we also want to imbue material things with spiritual meaning. We want speed, and we want progress; industry is the product of progress. But we also want stability in progress. Therefore, we want industry, and we also want agriculture, and we also want the industrialization of agriculture.

Looking at the world from the perspective of agriculture, I believe: (1) The origin of human disasters lies in the destruction of agriculture and the abuse of farmers; this is especially true in China! (2) Humans are historical and cultural animals, ethnic and international issues are historical and cultural issues, and farmers are the creators of history, while agriculture is the nourisher of culture.

(3) The world should become a garden, not just a factory. People should use machines to benefit them, and they should not become machines themselves and be used by machines.

(4) To understand world problems, we must focus on economics, but to solve world problems, we cannot but focus on human nature. We must promote the revival of human nature, and we must promote spiritual awakening.

(5) To understand Chinese problems, we should especially focus on history and culture; to solve Chinese problems, we should focus on production. At the same time, the farmer problem is China's first problem.

(6) In the above sense, undoubtedly, we need modernization, and we also need ultra-modernization. Only with modernization can China resist a new human disaster; only with ultra-modernization can China save a new human disaster.

(7) In the sense of ultra-modernization, we certainly need democracy, United Nations institutions, and an ethical society. We even more need centripetal democracy, cultural harmony, and an ethical society.

(8) The primary meaning of the West is the garden city, while we are industrial villages. Rural development should be the good ending for good people.

(9) The science of agriculture is the science of biology and the science of life. The world should be a biological, living world. In this world, our national defense and our tactics should be brand new!

(10) The achievements of agricultural science and agricultural education will ultimately determine the future of humanity because the future will be a garden city and a realm of agricultural industrialization!

In the aftermath of another world catastrophe and great human sacrifice, a pre-dawn pain is still haunting our hearts. For the future of humanity, everyone must look squarely at the current world. Like what has been said above, we are implicitly continuing a unique historical and cultural tradition. We want to connect to something, then establish something, and then actually do something. In the eyes of countless people today, this may not seem new, but it is ultimately true and can benefit people. At the same time, how can we ignore the exchange of human history and culture? Our overall goal as human beings is the "continuation" of historical culture, but this "continuation" can only be sought in "tradition" and "exchange." I look at the world from the perspective of history and culture, and I know that industry has its future, and agriculture has its prospects. It is from these prospects of agriculture that we can more easily see ourselves and our world!

### Sing, Nanjing!

— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Yue Haosheng

Ten thousand kinds of colors could not record the grandeur of the National Government's return to the capital.

Ten thousand kinds of colors cannot fully depict this unprecedented joy; ten thousand kinds of sounds cannot fully express the laughter filling the sky. May 5th, the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China, is a day of double celebration, a glorious historical festival. The entire city of Nanjing is bathed in revelry, and all of Nanjing is immersed in incessant singing.

On the morning of May 4th, when I stepped off the first train from Shanghai to Nanjing, I was so moved by the fervent preparations underway for the return to the capital that I immediately plunged into a state of extreme excitement. Without a moment to breathe, I rushed to the Central Propaganda Department building, squeezed in with colleagues from all over the country, and collected my reporter's pass for the next day's ceremony. The two colors, light red and deep red, both represented joy, but everyone scrambled for the deep red one, because it was for photographers, allowing them to get closer to the center of the ceremony. After spending four hours completing the procedures, I began to survey Nanjing on the eve of the Return to Capital Ceremony amidst the neon-lit night market, bathed in a red glow.

Crowds surged along the streets like tides, everyone spending the evening with the same quick, cheerful steps and happy mood. Young people were like those on the eve of their wedding, children like those on the eve of the New Year, and the elderly were even more excited, for the greatest joy of their lives was about to arrive.

Every Street Aglow with Red

On every major street, huge banners as long as the roads themselves, reading "Welcome the National Government's Return to the Capital" and "Welcome Chairman Chiang's Victorious Return," had been hung high. The two newly constructed giant paifang (ornamental archways) on Guofu Road looked even more magnificent under the illumination of the lights and the backdrop of the night. They were entirely three-dimensional, a fusion of Chinese and Western architectural styles. Four vermilion pillars supported exquisitely painted archways. On both sides of the triumphal arch-style pillars, five brightly colored national flags and party flags stood firm. At the top of the arch, four massive and heavy golden characters on a red background read "Celebrate the Return to the Capital," shimmering in the light, a scene of pure red.

The National Government Like a Novel Constellation

Standing in front of the National Government Building, looking up at its main gate, a long string of electric lights was strung from the top of the sky-piercing flagpole to both sides of the gate. Against the backdrop of the night sky, it looked like a novel constellation from afar, or a long curtain woven with stars. Holding my newly obtained press pass, I negotiated with the guards at the gate to enter and see the night view inside the National Government.

Stepping through the gate of the National Government, one enters a cement square, with a straight road leading directly to the last building. Countless national flags and party flags were erected around the gardens on both sides of the road, surrounded by a ring of colorful floral borders, a truly beautiful scene.

Vermilion Pillars Standing in the Courtyard

Following this road straight ahead, the first section is a high-ceilinged courtyard with six rows of thirty vermilion pillars standing in the middle. Further in, the interior is completely painted green, with a marble-colored carpet with red edges running straight from here to the courtyard in front of the Chairman's office building. Under the lights, it looks like a long, winding dragon, infinitely meandering, infinitely far. Turning a corner from the third door, you can enter the auditorium. Candle-shaped electric lights illuminate the auditorium brightly, and the mercury lamps of the Central Film Studio were already arranged in place. Returning to the original road and passing through another courtyard, you reach the Chairman's office building. A guard standing on the porch came up to question me. After I explained my purpose again, he allowed me to go up, and the lights on the corridors were already on.

In the Chairman's Office Building

I carefully inspected every room. The first room on the left on the second floor is the Chairman's office. The glass door was tightly locked, and a wooden sign with the key number "Second Floor, Number 13" hung on the doorknob. The second room next door is the Chairman's reception room, and diagonally opposite is the Chief Secretary's office. The conference room on the third floor has a mountain-shaped conference table, coffee-colored leather chairs. The room is quiet, and the electric fans and lotus-shaped chandeliers on the ceiling seem to be waiting for their master to "turn them on." Surrounding the conference room are the committee members' lounges. The fourth floor houses the radio archives, etc. Standing on the top floor balcony, overlooking the entire National Government, all lit up. Except for encountering the guards and workers rushing to arrange things at night, everything was quiet, and the croaking of frogs from the surrounding gardens could be heard very clearly. The night breeze carried the faint fragrance of the garden. I lingered in the Chairman's office building, the friction of my leather shoes against the carpet being the loudest sound. Coming down from the balcony, I went to the door of the Chairman's office again. Someone opened and closed the green screen door. I stroked the glowing copper handrail, filled with solemn emotion and infinite reverent imagination. This shining doorknob is the very place connected to millions of hearts!

The Command Center for Peace and National Reconstruction

On the eve of this Return to Capital Ceremony, I alone came late at night to see this National Government, symbolizing infinite glory. Tomorrow, this building will begin to serve as the highest command center for peace and national reconstruction, and will also become the place to which people all over the world "yearn to go." At the gate, I chatted with the guards. He had returned to Nanjing last December, and had worked in the guard team before the war. When I asked about the Return to Capital Ceremony the next day, he could not suppress the joy on his face, even while standing at attention in a solemn manner.

A Story of Children at a Friend's Home

Leaving the National Government and going to a friend's house, I was even more moved by the joyful atmosphere permeating the family. The mother was taking out the most colorful and beautiful clothes from the wardrobe for the child, and the child was jumping around, unwilling to sleep. He circled around his great-grandfather's knees, constantly asking about the stories of "tomorrow." This child, who was only seven years old and grew up during the war, was returning to Nanjing for the first time and loved hearing stories about Nanjing. When his great-grandfather began to tell him about the fall of Nanjing, he leaned against his great-grandfather's knees, listening intently with wide eyes. Finally, his great-grandfather hugged him in his arms and told him, "Child! Always remember to love China! Love Nanjing!" The great-grandfather's voice trembled slightly, and tears glistened in the child's moved eyes.

I walked back to the street, which was now decorated with floral clusters everywhere. All the light and color were used to depict the four characters "Celebrate the Return to the Capital." May 4th was a day without night, with millions of people using their eager work and limitless excitement to welcome the dawn.

Zhang Qun, acting director of the Chongqing Military Headquarters, took office on the 2nd of this month, with Xu Yongchang, Minister of Military Affairs, representing Chairman Chiang in presenting the seal of office.

The citizens of Shenyang held a grand meeting to welcome the National Army's entry into the city, an unprecedented event in the fourteen years since the Northeast fell. The picture shows the parade after the meeting, with General Xiong Shihui, Director of the Northeast Headquarters, in the upper right corner.

### Solemn Holy Ground · Solemn Grand Ceremony — Opened by the Sun Itself

Today, the cheers of these millions of people wash away the shame suffered for eight years!

After days of rain, the sun on the morning of the 5th appeared specifically for this unprecedented grand ceremony. Although dawn came early, cars and trucks of all sizes, covered in slogans, had already begun to shuttle back and forth on the streets, all kinds of vehicles rushing towards Zhongshan Gate, towards the direction of the rising sun.

On the asphalt road outside Guanghua Gate, lined with dense shade trees, looking towards Zhongshan Mausoleum, a wisp of ethereal morning mist enveloped the mausoleum. The sun rose higher and higher, and the mist faded more and more. This solemn holy ground, this solemn grand ceremony, was to be opened by the sun itself.

Arriving at the Snow-White, Glorious Mausoleum

Arriving, arriving, the mausoleum, infinitely verdant in the morning sun, shining with a snow-white radiance, had arrived. Getting out of the car in the square in front of the gate, looking up at Zijin Mountain, the steps of the mausoleum looked like a high ladder that could lead directly to the blue sky. On the high poles on both sides, the national flags and party flags fluttered in the morning sun and morning breeze. Taking steps full of solemnity and infinite joy, climbing up step by step, everyone's faces were full of smiles. Even if they did not know each other, everyone greeted each other with smiles.

Civil and Military Officials Gathered One After Another

In the square in front of the memorial hall, civil and military officials, senators, and national representatives gathered, shaking hands, greeting each other, and asking, "When did you arrive in Nanjing?" Military officials were on the left, all wearing new-style army uniforms, their stars gleaming; civil officials were on the right, wearing suits and long robes, their styles varied. On the civil officials' side, the Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members were in the front, with senators and national representatives in the back. Standing committee members wore special red stripes. They were allowed in the memorial hall. News reporters were arranged on both sides outside the gate of the memorial hall.

President Sun and his eldest son were asked by photographers to gather in front of the statue of the Father of the Nation for group photos. President Song, wearing a blue Zhongshan suit, constantly shook hands with everyone. He Yingqin and Chen Cheng came from the left, everyone ____. When Wu Tiecheng walked out of the auditorium again to greet them, everyone knew that the Chairman was about to arrive. A round of applause rang out, and Chairman and his wife walked up from the central traffic road.

Chairman Wearing Five Grand Medals

The Chairman wore a new-style khaki army uniform with five grand medals on his chest. The Madame wore a dark woolen coat and a dark blue cheongsam with purple morning glories. She wore a medal of honor on her left lapel, and a badge of the Aviation Committee. The Madame was on the left, and the Chairman was on the right, and they walked into the memorial hall.

The ceremony began, and the sound of the salute echoed with earth-shattering rhythm. The ceremony proceeded amidst the salute, playing music, and offering flowers. Zhang Daofan read the eulogy, and airplanes scattered leaflets in the low sky. Inside the memorial hall, lights flashed, and after the ceremony was completed, the Chairman led everyone around to pay their respects. After a quarter of an hour, they walked out of the memorial hall with heavy steps and stood on the steps in the sunlight to deliver a speech. The speech was written in large characters on a stack of memo papers, short and forceful, and often interrupted by enthusiastic applause. After finishing the speech, the ceremony ended. The Chairman and his wife walked down the steps, and the crowd embraced and walked along. Applause and shouts of "Long Live the Chairman!" rose and fell, continuously. A section of the cane, looking around, shining a healthy red in the sun, the Chairman's health, is the joy of all Chinese people!

The Father of the Nation Knows and Smiles in Joy

Boy Scouts on both sides jumped and cheered, and the Madame waved a four-colored handkerchief to greet the children. Chinese and foreign photographers rushed to the front, climbing high to capture this precious moment. Leaving the mausoleum! Before getting into the car, the Chairman stood in front of the car door, paying his respects to the top of the mountain and returning the salute to the crowd. Along with the light dust kicked up by the car, the cheers roared like thunder. Today, the cheers of these millions of people washed away the shame suffered by the mausoleum for eight years. The Father of the Nation, sleeping in Zijin Mountain, would know and smile wholeheartedly. On the streets of the city, crowds surged like tides, cheering towards the Chairman's car. Nanjing was submerged in songs of joy filling the sky!

### At the Celebration Meeting

— Zhang Ming, This Newspaper's Correspondent in Nanjing

Every Chinese Son and Daughter Present Felt Comforted: The National Government Has Now Returned to Nanjing!

The procession of people and vehicles moved out of the mausoleum. People's emotions were excited. The boundless, sea-like sound was spreading. They were all striving for an opportunity to stand near Chairman and Madame, or even to take a step forward, because it was an honor.

This tide of people and vehicles surged on the wide asphalt road, neatly planted with poplars and locust trees on both sides. The particularly clear sunshine shone on everything. People's hearts turned towards the light!

Many magnificent celebratory paifang (archways) were erected at various important locations. The vermilion color that added to the Eastern tone was painted on the high beams and pillars, adding much admiration to our enthusiasm. When the archways fell behind, we reached our destination—the National Assembly Square. A grand popular meeting was about to begin here, and people were participating freely. There were representatives of institutions, individual citizens, and government officials.

The layout of the meeting place was very simple. The platform stood high at one end of the meeting place. Strangers were not allowed to go up here. Some beautiful fresh potted flowers were arranged on the platform. At the same time, a huge flag standing in the center was presented to the Chairman by all the citizens of Nanjing. The four large characters on it read: "勋彪京关" [Xūn biāo jīng guān, roughly translates to "Meritorious deeds illuminate Jinguan (Nanjing)"]. The golden characters were pasted on a red background.

Because crowds were constantly pouring in from the entrance, the commander had to shout at the top of his lungs, asking everyone to pay attention to order. The large group of reporters was not assigned to any particular section, so they were constantly receiving orders from the loudspeakers. For example, "Retreat to the right" or "Take another step back," but the reporters were ultimately waiting in the waves of people until Chairman arrived.

It was 10:25 when cheers like an explosion filled the space. Chairman walked to the edge of the platform, and people cheered with even more enthusiastic hope. Then, the Madame also stepped forward and stood at the edge of the platform. Just like that, a sea of sound continued. I personally saw a little girl who, in a very difficult situation, squeezed into the group of reporters and shouted, "Long Live Chairman Chiang!" Then, a very happy, intimate smile radiated on her face. Naturally, she felt that being so close to the Chairman, hearing her voice in person, she was a citizen, she had this hope, and she received the satisfaction she deserved.

Amid the cheers, the order of the meeting began; but until Chairman's speech began, the continuous sound of "Long Live the Chairman" could still be heard all around...

The Chairman's speech was very concise, very practical, and very moving. People deeply felt that Chairman was standing with us today, and was so intimately remembering the people at the foot of Zijin Mountain. The Chairman once traced the situation when he left Nanjing twenty-six years ago. Those dim memories further promoted the excitement and enthusiasm of today's return to the capital. At the same time, Chairman said, "Today we are still in Nanjing, seeing all our compatriots again, and we have won the victory, our unequal treaties have been abolished, all these are the results of the struggle of compatriots across the country. I am really moved." Putting all the credit on the compatriots, people listened with even more gratitude.

"From today on, we must avoid being massacred and insulted by others. We must be self-reliant and self-reliant. All compatriots must unite and struggle, and work together to increase the strength and status of the country." This was a reminder, and at the same time, Chairman encouraged all compatriots to eliminate waste, value diligence and thrift, observe discipline, and be responsible. Finally, he wished everyone good health. This scene of excitement beyond measure came to a conclusion here. People shouted madly again. The order of the meeting almost wavered, but there was no chaos. Today, the sky was clear, and Zijin Mountain existed brilliantly in golden tones. Flags with the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth flew everywhere. Every son and daughter of the Chinese nation should be proud: The National Government has returned to Nanjing!

### Fragments of the Return to Capital Ceremony

— Mao Shukui, This Newspaper's Correspondent in Nanjing

Chairman and Madame

After Chairman Chiang's car arrived at the mausoleum, the organizing committee had prepared two sedan chairs. Chairman and his wife refused to sit and walked up to the memorial hall on foot, taking only 15 minutes and 20 seconds. Chairman's pace was steady, not breathless, not blushing, and everyone was happy for Chairman's health.

When Chairman Chiang gave a speech and saluted, Madame Chiang always stepped back one step, but when getting on and off the car and climbing the stone steps, the Madame was in front and Chairman was behind.

Chairman's speech draft consisted of nine pages with extra-large characters, probably because he was afraid he couldn't see clearly. After Chairman finished speaking, he handed it over to Yu Jishi for safekeeping.

Madame Chiang wore a black coat today, a high-necked long wool cheongsam with black background and purple flowers, black open-toed high-heeled shoes, and black earrings. The whole outfit was in plain colors, which made her look even more solemn.

Various Aspects of the Meeting Place

The organizing committee for the Return to Capital Ceremony worked all night yesterday, especially the transportation group, which was the busiest issuing temporary passes.

There were many types of attendance certificates for the meeting, some were long, some were flat, some were light red, and some were deep red. It didn't matter at all when participating, but it made a big difference when entering the memorial hall.

The youngest of the Boy Scouts maintaining order in the mausoleum was named Qi Yaxiong, only nine years old. Although he was small, his spirit was very good.

Civil and military officials in front of the Founder's Memorial Hall were divided into left and right sides. On the civil side, there were more than 2,000 central committee members, senators, national representatives, and senior civil officials from various ministries and departments. The first person in the first row was Zhang Mojun, a female central committee member; on the military side, there were more than 1,000 generals of the army, navy, and air force, with the lowest rank being major. The first person in the first row was General Huang Qixiang, and the second person was General Tang Shizun.

The Lieutenant General MC reported it like this: "Central committee members stand in the first row, and so on for dozens of rows."

All military officers wore their medals today, creating a medal exhibition and medal competition.

The characteristic of the meeting at the mausoleum in the morning was a lot of applause, while at the grand square, there was a lot of cheering. One used hands, and the other used mouths, which was quite interesting.

Character Portraits

Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin was covered with many medals, as many as twelve, making him a good target for photographers.

The two brothers Gu Zhenggang and Gu Zhengding, after climbing the stone steps of the mausoleum, met Liu Wendao. The three of them walked and talked, all happy that the mausoleum had not been damaged. When they reached another place, Gu Zhenggang suddenly stopped and smiled to his younger brother, saying, "One of the dings here is missing."

Shao Lizi wore a brand-new, tailor-made Zhongshan suit and walked hand-in-hand with Madame Shao, inseparable, looking very intimate.

Among the female central committee members, Shen Huishu was the fattest, and Tang Guobai was the tallest. When Shen arrived at the mausoleum, her face was covered with a very plain and beautiful gauze scarf. But she said, "I'm not doing it for beauty."

Wang Xiaoxu, president of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, was blocked by the military police at the entrance when the mass celebration meeting was over, and the crowd behind him was still surging like a tide. President Wang was attacked from both sides and shouted "Get out of the way" "Get out of the way." Fortunately, a major general-level officer passed by and was able to rescue him.

Before the ceremony, reporters obtained information from news figures, among which Wu Guozhen was surrounded for the longest time. Wu wore a long robe and mandarin jacket today, but he was smiling with all his heart today, so although he was solemn, he was still amiable.

Car Exhibition

There were as many as thousands of cars parked next to the mausoleum, some were the oldest, and some were the newest, like a long snake. It can be said that they are the collection of all the cars in Nanjing, a magnificent sight.

Early this morning, cars were driving on the road of the mausoleum. According to the guards of the mausoleum, the first car to arrive at the mausoleum was the reporter's car of a certain newspaper, at 5:40.

Chinese and Foreign Reporters

More than 160 reporters participated in the Return to Capital Ceremony, including newspapers from all over the country. Among them was an old reporter from Henan Qingbai Newspaper, who was 60 years old. His white beard was fluttering, which attracted the attention of his peers.

When the ceremony was about to begin, the foreign reporter team swarmed in, making a great show. The Chinese reporters, standing behind the military police, immediately perked up and were unwilling to fall behind, preparing to follow the team and enter, but the result: "They were also blocked."

For the sake of the ceremony, Chinese and foreign reporters gathered in the capital, some taking the night train from Shanghai, and some flying from Chongqing. It was truly "a gathering of officials" and "a sea of people."

In addition to eight Associated Press reporters and others participating in the interviews and photography, there were no other foreigners at the Return to Capital Ceremony at the mausoleum.

Troops Demand Grain, Deadline Set for Allocation: Due to the urgent need for military grain in the county, the Provincial Field Grain Office specifically ordered County Magistrate Fang to allocate 200,000 city pounds of rice from the county's quota of 10,000 shi for the 49th Army to collect nearby. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Fang, considering that the county's military grain procurement had not yet begun and that the immediate supply of grain for the troops was impossible, convened an emergency meeting of the district offices on the 30th of last month. It was decided that before the military grain procurement, each district office would temporarily borrow grain by the deadlines of May 4th, 8th, 13th, and 18th. The borrowed grain would be deducted from the future procurement quota. The county government also scheduled a meeting for the morning of the 1st to discuss the procurement of military grain.

The allocation method is as follows: 1,000 shi for the urban area, 1,600 shi for Zhouzhuang district, 1,000 shi for Chenyang district, 2,000 shi for Huashi district, 2,000 shi for Changjing district, 1,600 shi for Qingyang district, and 800 shi for Zhonggang district. The procurement targets are wealthy merchants and large households, or owner-farmers with more than five mu of land. At the same time, a committee will be formed to handle the matter in accordance with provincial orders.

### The Fate of All the People of India Hinges on It: Round Table Conference Opens Yesterday: Britain Suggests Establishing a Joint Government: Except for National Defense, Diplomacy, and Transportation, Regional Division Can Be Implemented

[Our Newspaper Report] New Delhi, 5th Dispatch: The Simla Round Table Conference, concerning the fate of India's 400 million people, opened today, with twelve participants. The Congress Party representatives are Party Chairman Acharya Kripalani, Executive Committee members Nehru, Patel, and Ghaffar. The Muslim League representatives are Party Chairman Jinnah, Syed, Ismail, Mashtai, and three others. Gandhi is providing advice to the Indian people behind the scenes. After the opening, the main issue of Indian unity was immediately discussed. The British Cabinet delegation suggested establishing two separate governments, one for India and one for the Muslim community. Except for foreign policy and transportation, each could govern itself. Jinnah immediately opposed concentrating power in one government. The representatives resolved to meet twice daily and publish the results of the meeting daily.

[Reuters, Simla, 5th Dispatch] The British-Indian Round Table Conference began today at the Governor-General's residence to negotiate India's constitutional plan. The British representatives are Cabinet Ministers Lawrence, Cripps, and Alexander. This conference will not be very long but has extremely important and decisive significance. The British Cabinet representatives have proposed several suggestions: (1) Establish a joint government to control the national defense, diplomacy, and transportation of the entire country; (2) Provinces have various rights beyond the aforementioned stipulations, including delineating Muslim and non-Muslim areas according to the distribution of residents; (3) Indian states may also join after consulting with the joint government after an equal period. These suggestions are the starting point of the negotiations. However, the Congress Party and the Muslim League have both stated in advance that their participation in the meeting will not be bound by any restrictions and that they can resist, modify, or reject any disputed points. Observers predict that the mission of the British representatives is to find a compromise between the concessions that the Congress Party is willing to make and the minimum demands of the Muslim League. The first two or three days of the meeting are usually the most important.

### Food Panic in the Far East: China and India Are the Most Severe: Hoover Arrives in Tokyo from Korea Yesterday

[United Press, Tokyo, 5th Dispatch] Truman's special envoy for food investigation, Hoover, arrived at Atsugi Airport this afternoon from Incheon, Korea, in poor weather.

From the Diary of a Private Doctor: Exposing Hitler's Life: So-Called God-Man Turned Out to Be Like This

### \[United Press International, Greensburg, Indiana, 3rd\] Those who worship Hitler often see him as a god-like figure. However, if one were to read the diary of his personal physician, such a notion would vanish. According to the diary, Hitler frequently received injections and swallowed vitamin pills. Due to his bad temper, he often suffered from stomach problems and was superstitious about the healing power of leeches. The diary also records that Hitler used hair oil on his left eye and other such "vulgar" behaviors.

Resolving World Problems Requires True Democracy – Speech by British Secretary of State
\[Reuters, London, 5th\] Secretary of State Bevin stated yesterday at the 21st International Rotary Club Conference that every event the Security Council deals with would inevitably lead to a worse situation without the Council's existence. Borders are not a guarantee of security; collective effort is essential to prevent aggression. Only collective peace can bring happiness to humanity. For the past six years, many believed that world problems could not be resolved without force. While force can defeat aggression, it cannot solve long-term problems. Such problems should be resolved through reason and agreement. Therefore, only true democracy can resolve world problems, and this is the goal we strive for.

World's First Atomic Generator Reaches Design Stage
\[Associated Press, Chicago, 5th\] The University of Chicago announced today that the world's first atomic "generator" has reached the blueprint design stage. The generator, designed by the University of Chicago, will be built by the large atomic bomb factory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. It will generate electricity by harnessing high temperatures. Major General Groves, who is in charge of the atomic bomb research and manufacturing program, recently disclosed that $2.5 million will be allocated for atomic power generation experiments at the Oak Ridge factory. According to Dr. Daniel, director of the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago and one of the designers of this experimental atomic generator, the current cost of generating atomic energy is quite high and atomic energy cannot yet compete with coal in terms of economics. However, new developments may change this situation.

Draft Constitution of the Fourth Republic – French Referendum to Be Held Again – If Rejected Again, a New Constitution Will Be Drafted – Foreign Ministers of Various Countries Pay Close Attention to This Matter
\[Reuters, Paris, 5th\] France is holding a referendum today to decide whether to adopt the new constitution. Some people rushed to the polling stations as early as 8:00 AM because today is Sunday, and they plan to go for a trip to the countryside after voting.

\[Associated Press, Paris, 5th\] The draft constitution of the French Fourth Republic, prepared by the French Constituent Assembly, is being submitted to a national referendum of 25 million citizens today. The Constituent Assembly is dominated by leftist parties. Judging from the current situation, the difference between the number of votes for and against is expected to be very small. This draft constitution adopts a unicameral system, stipulating that legislative, executive, and judicial powers are concentrated in one National Assembly. The Senate of the Third Republic has been abolished. The powers of the President are severely limited, and the Premier is produced by the National Assembly. The majority of judges of the Supreme Court and all thirty judges of the High Court are also elected by the Assembly. If the national referendum approves the draft constitution, a general election will be held on June 6 to elect official members of parliament. If it is rejected, a new Constituent Assembly will be elected in June to draft a new constitution. All French territories, except Vietnam, will participate in this referendum. Those who oppose this draft constitution claim that concentrating all powers in the Assembly will inevitably lead to a dictatorship by the majority party in the National Assembly, which is the Communist Party.

\[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 4th\] Well-informed sources here have said that foreign politicians and diplomats are gathering here, paying close attention to the French referendum to be held tomorrow to gauge public opinion on the draft constitution passed by the National Constituent Assembly. It is generally believed that the outcome of the referendum will determine what policies France will adopt within a year. For example, the attitude of the French representative at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference will be directly influenced by the composition of the cabinet. If the French people endorse this draft constitution in tomorrow's referendum, the question of whether Foreign Minister Bidault will resign will become an issue, and the foreign ministers of the UK, US, and Soviet Union will also question this. However, French officials say that the outcome of tomorrow's referendum will not affect the fate of the cabinet. Only after the general election in early June will the cabinet be reorganized. Therefore, external fears and the rumors of Bidault's resignation are unfounded.

A Large Swarm of Locusts Attacks Sardinia, Italy – Formation Stretches 28 Miles

Eisenhower Scheduled to Fly to Shanghai the Day After Tomorrow – States in the Philippines that the US Cannot Afford to Be Weak
\[Associated Press, Manila, 4th\] US Army Chief of Staff Dwight D. Eisenhower, after inspecting military facilities in the Manila area today, told reporters that the rapid demobilization of the US military is severely hindered by the need to maintain important military bases in the Pacific region. The US military strength in the Philippines depends on a political agreement between the United States and the Republic of the Philippines. Regarding the establishment of air bases, the United States hopes to reach an agreement with the Philippines. The newly elected President of the Philippines, Roxas, recently declared his guarantee of close cooperation with the United States in defense matters, which makes Eisenhower's statement significant. According to Washington sources, the former Philippine Army Chief of Staff and current head of the Philippine Military Mission to the United States, Valdes, stated, "I 100% agree with Roxas's policies and Eisenhower's hope to establish air bases in the Philippines." Eisenhower continued, "Existing equipment worth millions of dollars needs to be taken care of, but no one is paying attention to it." While Eisenhower could not specify the minimum number of divisions needed in the Pacific region, he said, "I would like history to prove that we can never afford to be weak." Eisenhower is scheduled to fly to Shanghai on the 8th of this month, and then proceed to Korea and Japan.

\[Associated Press, Washington, 5th\] On the 8th of this month, the anniversary of the victory in Europe in this great war, General Eisenhower issued a message stating, "The nations have not yet fulfilled their obligation to those who achieved victory until a lasting world peace is established." Secretary of War Patterson also issued a message, echoing Eisenhower's praise for the achievements of the armed forces.

Rumors Say Mussolini's Body Has Been Transported to Spain – His Daughter-in-Law Drowns in a Lake
\[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 4th\] Regarding the mystery of Mussolini's missing body, Italian newspapers recently reported that the police received an anonymous letter stating that Mussolini's body had been secretly transported to Spain.

Foreign Ministers of Four Powers Attempt to Break Impasse – The Key Lies in Different Basic Policies – The Resolution of the Italian-Yugoslavian Border Issue Is the Most Difficult
\[This Newspaper's Report\] London, 5th (Radio Broadcast): The Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers today renewed their efforts to break the impasse over the Italian-Yugoslavian border issue. A BBC correspondent in Paris reported that the "disagreements" among the Four Foreign Ministers are extremely deep, and the key lies in the different basic policies of the Four Powers. After many days of discussion, no progress has been made, and the only achievement is the agreement reached at the previous London conference. The Foreign Ministers of the UK, US, and France believe that Italy and other Axis countries should not be placed in a desperate situation, but the Soviet side does not share this view.

\[This Newspaper's Report\] London, 5th (Radio Broadcast): The informal meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers, originally scheduled for 4:00 PM today, was postponed at the last minute. At the request of US Secretary of State Byrnes, it was rescheduled for 11:00 AM tomorrow.

\[Reuters, Paris, 5th\] The Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers discussed the border issue between Italy and Yugoslavia for five hours yesterday but still failed to reach a resolution. Byrnes proposed holding a referendum under Allied supervision between the borders proposed by the US and the Soviet Union, so that local residents could decide for themselves whether they wished to be governed by Italy or Yugoslavia. The Border Demarcation Team, composed of representatives from the Four Powers, proposed four different demarcation plans. The Yugoslav representative, Kardelj, stated yesterday that the demarcation plans proposed by the UK, US, and France are unacceptable to the Yugoslav government. The new border proposed by the Yugoslav government is still west of the line proposed by the Soviet Union. At the meeting yesterday morning, Molotov supported the Yugoslav proposal, Bevin stated that the border line proposed by the UK was the most appropriate, and the border line proposed by France was more in line with the principle of resident ethnicity.

\[Reuters, Paris, 5th\] After the Foreign Ministers Conference again reached an impasse on the Italian-Yugoslav border issue, attendees at the conference have been divided into two camps regarding the success or failure of the conference. The British side believes that yesterday's impasse will make it impossible to resolve the Italian peace treaty at this session, so Byrnes' proposal to replace the peace treaty with a revised armistice agreement is likely to be adopted. On the other hand, there is a more optimistic view, which is based on two reasons: (1) Byrnes came to Paris on President Truman's special plane, "Sacred Cow". Byrnes ordered the plane to return to the United States to be used by the President before May 10, so it is expected that Byrnes will stay in Paris until after May 10. Therefore, the conference cannot be considered to have broken down. (2) The US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, who was originally scheduled to return to the Soviet Union this weekend, is still staying in Paris, which shows that the United States is determined to break the impasse.

Switzerland's New Trends - A Nation That Has Never Been Involved in War - Translated Manuscript from This Newspaper's Compilation Office

General Economic Situation
According to the latest 1945 Swiss economic report published by the Swiss Federal Economic Research Committee, the number of employed workers increased by 4.3% in the third and fourth quarters of 1945, exceeding December 1944 by 12.1%. The labor shortage was most severe in the industrial and agricultural sectors, for two reasons: First, agricultural and industrial products were previously imported from foreign countries. Since imports have ceased, they must be produced domestically, thus increasing the demand for labor. Second, there is a need to meet the urgent demands of areas and countries ravaged by war. The sharp increase in exports offset the decline in domestic market demand. According to export quantity statistics, the quantity of Swiss exports increased by about three-quarters compared to the same period before the war.

Due to certain circumstances, especially the devaluation of major food imports, the price level in Switzerland showed a downward trend in the last quarter of 1945. The prices of domestically manufactured products remained relatively stable, but the prices of imported goods fell by 7.5%. Although the prices of clothing and fuel increased slightly, the cost of living index fell by about 1.4% due to the decrease in food prices. However, workers' wages are adjusted to the current situation, and the actual purchasing power of ordinary workers has reached the level of 1939.

Investments in Germany
Like most other countries, especially the Netherlands, the UK, and the US, Switzerland invested a large amount of capital in Germany between 1924 and 1931. The purpose of the investment was to help Germany rebuild, consolidate its national economy, and restore its international position. However, the inflow of Swiss capital into Germany suddenly stopped in 1931 (the year of the economic panic in Central Europe, two years before Hitler came to power). After this economic panic occurred, some Swiss capitalists even recovered their investments, but after a few months, Germany adopted currency control policies, and this transaction was terminated. Since 1932, Switzerland has no longer invested in Germany.

Contents of the National Defense Plan
During World War II, Switzerland had a total of about 500,000 troops in all its lines of defense, and about 300,000 men and women served in the front and rear. In addition, 100,000 people were mobilized to form the domestic defense force. Thus, the total number of Swiss troops actually participating in national defense work was 900,000, accounting for about one-fifth of the country's population of 4.3 million.

The wartime national defense expenditure was about 9 billion Swiss francs; of which 2.8 billion Swiss francs were used for military equipment, 830 million Swiss francs were used for fortifications, and about 4.5 billion Swiss francs were used for wartime mobilization emergency expenses. The remaining 1.1 billion Swiss francs were used for the military welfare fund. This 9 billion Swiss franc national defense expenditure means that each citizen was assigned more than 2,000 Swiss francs, which proves that the Swiss people are willing to sacrifice to defend the independence and neutrality of their motherland.

Overview of Hydroelectric Power
From 1944 to 1945, the total amount of electricity in Switzerland was 9.655 billion kilowatt-hours. There are several reasons why Switzerland's electricity production has increased significantly in the past few years: (1) Switzerland is a country rich in white coal, and hydropower is its only natural resource. (2) Due to the difficulty in obtaining coal, this natural resource has been fully utilized, and several large power plants have been built in the country, all using the natural power of mountain waterfalls and rivers.

Switzerland's electricity consumption has increased from 7.432 billion kilowatt-hours to 8.771 billion kilowatt-hours, representing the energy of 230,000 tons of imported coal. From 1944 to 1945, only 160,000 tons of coal were imported into Switzerland. Therefore, it is easy to imagine how important this modern power source is to a small country. The Swiss Federal Railways are completely electrified, and the electricity consumed last year was 1.5 million kilowatt hours more than in 1943, but the consumption in the industrial sector has decreased.

Survey of Factory Workers
On September 20, 1945, Switzerland conducted a national survey of factory workers. The survey results are as follows: On this day, the total number of workers employed in various industries was 435,603, an increase of 9,543 compared to 426,010 in the previous year. This survey figure is close to the highest record of September 17, 1941 (i.e., 435,862).

Trends in Industry and Commerce
Switzerland has a significant tendency toward high industrialization. This trend can be clearly seen from the country's government's industrial and commercial registration figures. At the end of 1945, there were a total of 110,090 formally registered commercial firms. Among these figures, an interesting feature is that sole proprietorships account for the largest number, totaling 59,713. The second largest is partnerships, totaling 18,243. The least common is limited companies, with only 890. Among all regions in the country, the region with the most developed industry and the most commercial firms has 17,058 companies. The second largest is the Canton of Bern, with 16,596 companies. The Canton of Vaud has 12,273, and then Geneva. The distribution of Swiss industry and commerce is roughly as described above.

The Whole City Joyfully Celebrates – Lanterns and Decorations Welcome the Return of the Capital – City Party Headquarters, Youth League, etc. Hold Commemorative Ceremonies – Deputy Mayor He Broadcasts Encouraging Citizens to Assist in Construction

\[This Newspaper's Report\] All sectors of the city celebrated the anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital yesterday in a joyful mood.

All agencies, organizations, factories, and schools were closed, and national flags flew throughout the city. The authorities, with leaders gathered in the capital, did not hold any large-scale celebrations. The City Party Headquarters and the Youth League held commemorative ceremonies. The Heroes' Association also held a celebration of the return to the capital and a members' gathering at 9:00 AM yesterday.

Many stores throughout the city held special sales to decorate and celebrate the grand return of the capital. When reporters browsed the streets, they saw lanterns and decorations, and many stores announced their resumption of business or new openings. There were also firecrackers along Nanjing Road, and pedestrians were shoulder to shoulder, more so than usual. Ticket lines were seen in front of various entertainment venues.

The police department and the city defense corps dispatched patrol teams, armed with live ammunition, to patrol the streets. The order of the whole city was as peaceful as usual.

Yesterday's weather was still not sunny, with widespread overcast skies, which was like a symbol of the current domestic political situation. Generally, people hoped that after the return of the National Government to the capital, the political haze that had been gathering for a long time could be cleared. Last night, after listening to Chairman Chiang's broadcast of the return to the capital address to the city, the citizens of the city were more convinced that the National Government would be able to quickly reach a reasonable solution to the current political situation and lead the country to the road of revitalization and construction.

Deputy Mayor He Broadcasts Speech

Deputy Mayor He Dachan, from 7:50 PM to 8:00 PM last night, delivered a broadcast speech to the public at the Shanghai Broadcasting Station, celebrating the return to the capital. He said, "The return of the National Government to Nanjing is the most important event after our country's victory. The whole country is holding warm celebrations simultaneously. The grand return to the capital ceremony held under Zijin Mountain today was so solemn. Mayor Qian made a special trip to the capital to attend the grand event on behalf of the four million citizens of Shanghai. When we celebrate the return to the capital, we must first thank Chairman Chiang for his unparalleled achievements in leading the military and civilians of the whole country to victory in the War of Resistance. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, Shanghai was thousands of miles away from the wartime capital after its fall, and most citizens lived in isolation, unable to breathe the air of free China. Now that the government has returned to Nanjing, it can be said that the central government is within easy reach. We Shanghai citizens have the geographical privilege of 'being the first to enjoy the moonlight near the water.' From now on, we should invigorate our spirits and abide by the central government's laws as soon as we know them. Although it is now the period of national reconstruction after the war, our national difficulties have not yet been completely overcome, so we must 'worry about the world's troubles before others, and enjoy the world's pleasures after others.' We should take out all the advanced manpower and resources of Shanghai's industry and commerce to assist the government in promoting various construction projects related to the national economy and people's livelihood. Tomorrow's China will become a strong, prosperous, and happy country based on the Three Principles of the People, and the contribution of Shanghai citizens will be one of the main factors in its realization."

The "Triumph" Train Makes Its First Trip, Inviting Reporters to Tour Wuxi

\[This Newspaper's Report\] The Jinghu Railway Administration, in order to welcome the triumphant return of military and government personnel to the capital and reduce passenger congestion, has added a special express train, the "Triumph" train, from yesterday, the anniversary of the return to the capital. It departs from Shanghai at 7:00 AM every morning and arrives in Nanjing at 2:00 PM. It then departs from Nanjing at 3:50 PM and returns to Shanghai at 10:50 PM that night. The train made its maiden voyage yesterday morning. The Railway Administration specially invited reporters from Shanghai newspapers and news agencies to take the train to tour Wuxi. Gu Yaojie, head of the Business Section of the Transportation Department, and Shen Zunkong, director of the Passenger Transportation Section, accompanied them. After arriving in Wuxi, Station Master Zhang Mutao led them to visit famous scenic spots in Wuxi, such as Yuantouzhu, Xiaoji Mountain, Meiyuan, Huishan, and Taihu Lake. They enjoyed themselves to the fullest. The reporters returned to Shanghai on the original train at 11:00 PM that night.

The Shanghai Offices of the Executive Yuan and the Military Statistics Bureau are Ordered to Close

According to reliable sources, the Executive Yuan has all returned to the capital. The temporary Shanghai office of the President of the Yuan was ordered to close yesterday. As for the application for airplane seats on the Shanghai-Beiping line, it was approved by the President of the Yuan and will continue to be handled by China National Aviation Corporation from the same date. It is also understood that if President Song needs to come to Shanghai for official business in the future, he may still meet with important guests at the original location.

The Military Affairs Commission's Investigation and Statistics Bureau established a Shanghai office at 70 Du Mei Road after the victory of the War of Resistance and during the Shanghai takeover, specializing in arresting traitors. Since the Statistics Bureau has now been restored and moved to the capital, and the traitor cases have been transferred to the courts, the Shanghai office is no longer necessary. Therefore, it has been ordered to close and be abolished at the end of April. The owner of the house at 70 Du Mei Road, Du Yuesheng, has also recovered the property for his own use.

The Work of the Engineering Planning Group Is Actively Underway - Concrete Plans for Improving Ports and Railways Have Been Drafted - Request Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Funding

\[This Newspaper's Report\] The Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan has been established in Shanghai for two months and is actively carrying out its work. It has drafted a "National Preliminary Engineering Plan." Details were given in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the group has also drafted concrete plans for the repair and improvement of transportation and port projects. The two most important points are: First, the construction of Tanggu New Port. The plan has now been finalized and is being submitted to President Song of the Yuan for funding. The port is of great importance to the prosperity of Tianjin, so this plan is a beneficial undertaking. It is planned to build two north and south breakwaters. The piers will be equipped with the latest loading and unloading equipment and automatic coal loaders. In addition, it is planned to build warehouses and concrete roads, and to add special stone-carrying trains on the Beining Road to facilitate the construction. The estimated cost of all the above projects is over 20 million US dollars. It is heard that the port project will use mechanized tools for construction. At the same time, a large number of young engineers will be trained. The first phase of the plan is expected to be completed within two years. After the initial plan is completed, the new port's annual throughput will be more than 4 million tons, and the water depth will be 6 meters at low tide, which can be expanded to 8 meters in the future. In terms of construction, there are 2.862 million tons of breakwaters, 15.5 million cubic yards of dredged deep waterways, 100,000 square yards of pier pavement, one pier No. 2, one barge pier, 50,000 cubic yards of rubble work, one sluice gate, 40,000 feet of railway, and 200,000 square yards of concrete road.

It is also heard that after the port was recently reopened, one ship sunk by the Japanese when they withdrew has been salvaged, and eight mud boats are still intact. The port's repair machine shop has also resumed work.

Secondly, the plan for repairing and building railways has also been finalized and submitted to the Executive Yuan. Among them, if the Jinpu Railway is to be completely repaired after it is opened, it will require more than 19 million US dollars. The group recommends the rapid organization of powerful material ordering, expediting, transportation, and allocation agencies, the use of medicated sleepers, and the organization of bridge and ballast engineering teams to piece together and utilize damaged bridges. Mechanical methods will be used to manufacture ballast to greatly supplement railway materials. It is also heard that the Yellow River Bridge on the Pinghan Railway is too old, and the group believes that it cannot bear the weight, so it is recommended to replace it together.

American Engineers Inspect for Days

The American engineers of the group, Ted Todd, Pushing, and Finney, have been inspected at the request of the Municipal Engineering Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the Railway Bureau for several days. From May 2, they inspected Wusong, the future location of foreign shipping terminals, Zhanghuabang Railway Pier, the Dredging Bureau Repair Shop, Qiujiang Pier, Fuxing Island, various roads in the old city center, Yixian Road, Jungong Road, Beijing Road Ferry, Zhoujiadu, Dongchang, Qingningsi, and other piers, and Shangnan Railway and Pudong Avenue. Yesterday afternoon, they inspected the Lianglu Central Station, Maigen Road Freight Station, and the proposed dry bridge location on Xizang North Road. The Engineering Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the Railway Bureau will seek the group's opinions on the construction of ports and transportation in the city.

In addition, the highway group of the group, engineers Fang Fusen and Lu Xiaodan, and American technical consultant Hurd Roberts, together with Director Wu of the Technical Office of the Highway Administration, and a group of five people, flew to Hankou on the 3rd and transferred to Changsha, Hengyang, Guiyang, Chongqing, Chengdu, Xi'an, and other places. Along the way, they will inspect the highways on the Hunan, Hubei, Southwest, Sichuan, and Shaanxi lines and discuss plans to improve construction projects with the relevant authorities. It is heard that this trip will last for three weeks. After returning to Shanghai, they will go to Beiping and other places. Mr. Hou Jiayuan, the head of the group, has returned to Shanghai after inspecting water conservancy in Qiuyan a few days ago.

Under the Drizzling Rain, Mr. Evans Carlson's Condition - The Cold Smile Felt Even More Sorrow

Hearing that Mr. Evans Carlson's condition has improved recently, I rushed to the quiet Hong'en Hospital again yesterday afternoon in the drizzling rain, full of joy.

Pushing open the door of Mr. Carlson's room, I suddenly felt that there were many more things than when I found him a month ago - there was a screen at the door, and three dark embroideries on the wall. A large red satin embroidery screen was hanging straight, and two white ones were hanging horizontally, all covered with small flowers. The embroidery seemed not very skillful. There were also several more bookshelves along the wall, densely lined with books. The colorful covers were very beautiful, mostly novels. There was also a very beautiful wireless radio in front of Mr. Carlson's bed.

His Spirit Is Not As Good As Before

However, his spirit is not as good as before. I feel that he is more haggard than the last time I saw him. I forced myself to cheer up and asked about his condition, and congratulated him on the progress of his condition. But after he looked at me with sharp eyes, he said: "The doctors are all trying hard to tell me that my illness has turned around, but there is still a lot of water in my lungs, and I have to drain a lot of water every week. If this water does not decrease, I am afraid that the condition may not improve much? Although the doctors want to make me believe it, they cannot prove their statement to me." He seemed to smile again unintentionally, but this cold smile only made me feel more desolate.

I talked about the books he was reading, and he said: "I am too lazy to pick any good books. Reading is just to keep me from thinking too much."

He Has Already Given Up Writing

Because there was white paper, a pen, and ink on the table in front of his bed, I asked him: "Have you been writing anything lately?"

"I have already given up writing. Although I started writing a memoir, I feel that it is better not to write it anymore. I only want to write down the facts, but in China - you will know in another ten or fifteen years that writing down the facts may not make you happy!"

I asked him to comment on Churchill's several speeches in the United States. He said: "I don't believe there will be a third world war. The United States has the atomic bomb, and the saying that the Soviet Union also has the atomic bomb is just a rumor. Under this situation, would the Soviet Union be willing to go to war? The current war of words is only because everyone does not know to what extent the Soviet Union's demands will go, but this is only a matter of time. We will know what the Soviet Union's demands are soon. I firmly believe that a world war can be avoided, because there is really no need to fight."

He Is Still Panting Very Badly

"What do you think of the Kuomintang-Communist issue?" I asked.

"Perhaps, from the perspective of the Communist Party, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to expand their influence, so they will do anything to achieve their goals." He paused and said in an extremely slow and serious tone; "I only hope now that General Marshall's efforts and Chairman Chiang's repeated concessions can make the Communist Party understand that now is really the time for the whole country to unite as one."

When I saw Mr. Carlson this time, he didn't use his left hand to hold his lungs as often as last time, but he was still panting very badly. He smiled bitterly and said, "After the victory, everyone is getting worse and worse, and my own body is the same."

He is still being treated by two doctors, and only eats liquids and soft bread every day. He ate some ham a few days ago, but yesterday morning, the doctor said that it is better not to eat ham. One of the nurses said, "He is still in good spirits and sleeps well at night." However, when I asked her if there was any improvement in Carlson's condition, she suddenly became silent.

Gunfire Erupts in Front of the Taishan Cinema - Bullets Fly Across Xinmin Road, Injuring Four Soldiers and Passersby

The Moviegoers Watching the Movie Were Frightened

\[This Newspaper's Report\] At 8:00 PM last night, the evening show of the movie "Wu Song and Pan Jinlian" was being shown at the Taishan Cinema at 81 Xinmin Road at the end of Henan Road. The audience was crowded. At about 8:30 PM, several soldiers from the 6th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the Military Police Team went to inspect. They ordered any soldiers they saw to leave. Several people with improper clothing were ordered to stand aside, preparing to lecture them. Seeing that Lian Mingchun, a police officer from the 7th Squadron of the Traffic Police of the Ministry of Transportation, was particularly improperly dressed, they immediately corrected him. Unexpectedly, Feng Fushou, a first-class police officer from the 8th Squadron's machine gun squad, who had a pistol and 47 rounds of ammunition, came forward to mediate, causing a very intense dispute. Before long, more than a dozen armed people, carrying new-style carbine rifles and a machine gun, crowded over. Seeing the situation deteriorating, the cinema quickly closed the iron gates. The military police immediately prepared to resist, while notifying the garrison headquarters patrol team by telephone. More than 30 reserve team members were dispatched. As they approached the cinema gate, gunfire suddenly erupted, firing twice. The first time lasted about 15 minutes, and the second time lasted about 5 minutes. A hand grenade also exploded, breaking the power lines next to the road. The patrol team was caught off guard because the entrance was dark, and the injured soldiers included Chen Shaoqing, a soldier from the 5th Company of the Special Service Team, who was shot twice in the left leg, and Wang Baogen, a squad leader from the 4th Company, who was shot once in the buttocks. Stray bullets injured Yu Tanggen, a tea server at the Xindu Hotel, who was injured in the neck; and Cui Henglin, a fried rice cake vendor, who was injured in the right leg. When large numbers of military police and defense corps members rushed to the scene after hearing the news, the shooters had already left. Because the cinema had closed the iron gates, the audience was forbidden to leave, and the movie continued to be shown in the cinema without stopping, so the order was not chaotic. It was not until the movie ended that they were dismissed. The other soldiers on the scene were also questioned by the military police one by one before being released. The injured soldiers and passersby were taken to the Municipal Fourth Hospital and the Public Charity Hospital by ambulances. Lian Mingchun and Feng Fushou were arrested and sent to the Garrison Headquarters for disposal. The surrounding area of the cinema was patrolled by the Defense Corps and military police, traffic was cut off, and martial law was temporarily imposed until 11:00 PM when the situation returned to normal.

Ministry of Education Issues National Order: Temporary Measures for Aiding Out-of-School Children; Establishing Primary School Classes in Private Homes

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] During the War of Resistance, local education institutions in the war zones were almost completely destroyed by the enemy and puppets. After the victory, the recovered areas are finding it extremely difficult to restore local education. In major cities, due to the restoration, the number of school-age children has increased sharply, and local educational administrative organs are temporarily unable to establish more national schools to accommodate them, resulting in an increasing number of out-of-school children. The Ministry of Education has specially formulated "Temporary Measures for Urban Organizations and Private Homes to Assist Local Governments in Aiding Out-of-School Children by Establishing Primary Schools or Primary School Classes," ordering education bureaus in various provinces and cities to mobilize organizations and private homes in various cities to establish primary schools or primary school classes to accommodate as many out-of-school children as possible, and to utilize existing houses, grounds, and equipment of organizations and private homes to facilitate the process. The necessary expenses will also be the responsibility of the various organizations to raise funds themselves, and if insufficient, the local educational administrative organs will provide appropriate subsidies. These measures will be announced soon.

The original establishment should be restored as an Institute of Technology. More than 900 students of the branch yesterday issued a declaration to all sectors, opposing the joint operation by Tsinghua University and Peking University, and requesting the government to change the branch into an independent Institute of Technology.

Sichuan Education Restoration Funds Approved for Four Hundred Million

[Our Chengdu Dispatch] Education restoration in Sichuan Province is being actively prepared. The restoration funds account for 80% of the total funds, approximately 40 million yuan. The Ministry of Education had already adjusted the schools slightly during the winter vacation last year, using a huge sum of 160 million yuan. The excess funds were temporarily advanced by the provincial government. In mid-April, Director Liu Mingyang went to Chongqing to request the Ministry of Finance to increase Sichuan Province's restoration funds to 1 billion yuan, of which education restoration funds would account for 800 million yuan, and also requested approval for the provincial government to advance the funds. It is now confirmed that the Ministry of Finance has approved 400 million yuan. According to the ratio of the requested increase to the approved amount, education restoration funds will account for 320 million yuan. There are still more than 50 schools in the province that have not been restored. If savings can be made, the funds can be sufficient. (Quan)

However, this will be temporarily limited to provincial and excellent private schools. As for county-level secondary schools, the Education Department should order the counties to mobilize local financial resources to restore them as soon as possible. The time for rewarding provinces and cities for restoring secondary schools has been set from February of this year to January of next year. The Education Department and Bureau of the recovered provinces and cities should report the restoration status monthly within the specified time, which will be reviewed and approved by the Ministry. The rewards will be submitted by the Ministry to the Executive Yuan for approval, and after reaching the Ministry, they will be allocated by the Ministry. (An)

Special Article: Education Restoration in Hunan (Continued)

Our Changsha Special Correspondent: Gao Yuanli

After the Xiang-Gui War

However, after the Xiang-Gui war in June of the 32nd year, Hunan's education suffered unprecedented blows and losses. Several education centers, such as Changsha, Xiangtan, Hengyang, and Shaoyang, were successively lost, school buildings were burned, equipment was damaged, and books and instruments were lost. In particular, higher education was completely wiped out. The three provincial vocational schools of agriculture, industry, and commerce were suspended. Among the 132 county and municipal secondary schools, 98 were affected. Among the 38 provincial secondary schools, 28 were affected. Among the 217 private secondary schools, 181 were affected. 649 central national schools were affected. 6,307 bao national schools were affected. 1,380 private primary schools were affected. 14 provincial primary schools were affected. In total, 8,350 public and private primary schools were affected, with a total loss of more than 89 billion yuan.

Although the losses were so great, the schools still moved from the cities to the countryside to continue classes. Many county secondary schools continued to have classes as usual not far from the enemy. Some students in some places even prepared for emergencies while attending classes. This kind of perseverance is truly admirable. Fortunately, the area west of Hunan was not ravaged by the enemy, and the schools there were preserved and continued to have classes.

This difficult support was maintained until the end of the war.

After the End of the War

After the end of the war, education should plan for restoration. The progress in the past six months has been quite smooth. The two provincial vocational schools of technology and engineering have been restored in Changsha. The business vocational school is temporarily restored with the Second Vocational School in Nanyue. In terms of secondary education, almost all provincial schools have been restored and moved back to their original locations. In terms of national education, because the schools are not concentrated in one place, restoration is easier, and most have actively started classes amid the ruins. The overall restoration situation is satisfactory.

However, the most difficult problem is still the school buildings. The restored schools either repair the existing school buildings for use, or rent civilian houses and ancestral halls to start classes. There is no ability to raise huge amounts of money to build school buildings. Hunan's disaster situation is also extremely tragic. According to the total estimated funds required for restoration by the Ministry of Education, more than 57.8 billion yuan is needed. The central government cannot approve these funds, and the local government cannot raise them on its own. It is not easy to restore the old appearance.

The allocation of temporary restoration funds is only given to provincial schools, and private schools are not included. Therefore, the restoration of private secondary schools is even more difficult. As a result, the schools stipulate that in addition to the grain salary, so-called relocation and construction fees are charged, with each person paying one dan of rice. The education authorities cannot provide assistance to private secondary schools, and it is not convenient to stop this matter. In fact, it is equivalent to tacitly approving it. As a result, the burden on students is increased, and a considerable number of students drop out of school because of this. This matter deserves attention.

Regarding the issue of standards, Director Wang admitted that the standards have been greatly reduced in recent years, partly because of insufficient equipment, and partly because the number of schools has increased dramatically, and there is a lack of teachers, resulting in this deformed phenomenon of quantity and quality. However, it is by no means easy to improve it in the near future.

Inspector He from the Zhejiang Education Department Departs to Inspect Various Places

[New Shanghai News Agency, Xingjia Dispatch] He Gang, an inspector from the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, has arrived in Jiaxing a few days ago to inspect the education restoration situation in various parts of Zhejiang Province. He will go to the provincial middle school, county middle school, and Xiumin middle school for inspection, and will then go to Huzhou for inspection.

Educational Facilities in Taiwan Province After Restoration

The Principle is That Schools Do Not Suspend Classes

[Dahua News Agency, Taipei Dispatch] Since Taiwan was taken over, under the principle of "schools do not suspend classes" by Chief Executive Chen, the main educational facilities are as follows: (1) In terms of higher education, Taiwan Province originally had Taipei Imperial University, which included the Faculties of Arts and Politics, Science, Agriculture, Engineering, Medicine, University Preparatory Course, and Medical Specialty Department. After being taken over by the Ministry of Education, it was renamed National Taiwan University. There are also three specialized schools: Taichung Agricultural and Forestry Specialized School, Tainan Industrial Specialized School, and Taipei Economic Specialized School, which were taken over by the Education Department of the Taiwan Provincial Government and renamed Taichung Provincial Agricultural Specialized School.

Taking the Lead with One Goal

At exactly 3:00 pm, referee Wang Shoufang and linesmen Huang Renyi and He Chunhui entered the field successively. The British Navy won the right to kick off and immediately attacked Donghua, but was blocked by Fu Zhen and Lin Wenhu. Geli Gulai strongly resisted. William Shi missed the opportunity, allowing Han Longbo to seize the ball. Song Lingsheng was about to shoot when Huo Li Huasi rushed to save and committed a foul. Li Yao executed, kicking the ball high into the net from 20 yards away. 1-0, Donghua took the lead, only five or six minutes into the game. The British team tried hard to counterattack, but they were unable to. After ten minutes, Li Yao launched an attack from the left, approaching the goal, but unfortunately missed. Not long after, En Shao Huisi, the left winger of the British Navy, crossed the ball into the middle. Tang Na Lai's leg rose like an arrow. Fortunately, Liu Xianhan was quick to react and prevented the goal. At the 22nd minute, Li Yao received a pass and launched a sharp kick. Le Fumen patted it out.

Not long after, the whistle blew, and the first half ended with each team scoring one goal.

A Great Victory

After halftime, the two teams continued to fight with the same lineup. Donghua became more courageous as they fought. Han Longhai seemed to have divine help, charging left and right. Looking back at the British army, they showed signs of fatigue, the battle lines shook, and there were loopholes everywhere. At the 20th minute, Longhai scored with the help of Fu Zhen, scoring close to the goal. 2-1, Donghua took the lead again. Five minutes later, Han Longhai sang and danced on his own, and once again made a great contribution, celebrating victory. 3-1, the British Navy lost another city. The British Navy was unwilling to give up and launched a joint counterattack. Tang Na Lai appeared behind the Donghua line, sweeping into the net from six or seven yards away. 3-2, the British Navy gradually became active. Seeing the situation was not good, Donghua quickly devised a countermeasure. The cooperation between Song Lingsheng was very hard work. At the 35th minute, Longhai shamelessly scored another goal. 4-2, the British Navy's overall situation was gone. In the last three minutes, Youliang, with a wonderful pass from the central army, tricked Qu Luomeng and lightly pushed the ball in, making it 5-2. The British Navy still tried to resist, but Dong's attack was very strong and refused to let go. Not long after, Sun Jinshun crossed the center line and ran to the left corner, hooking the ball from the baseline, making it 6-2. Time ran out, and Donghua won a great victory.
