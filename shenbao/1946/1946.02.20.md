### Military Demobilization Conference Concludes: Chairman Chiang Urges Strict Adherence to Duty, Achieves Three Demands of Efficiency, Refinement, and Speed

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 19th] The Military Demobilization Conference held its closing ceremony at 9:00 AM this morning. Chairman Chiang personally attended and delivered instructions. He first praised the generals for their deep understanding of the government's policy of peaceful unification and their conscientious adherence to the ceasefire order, considering them worthy of commendation. He then encouraged the generals to firmly uphold the military's duty to protect the country and its people, and advised them not to be overly concerned about current political and diplomatic matters. Subsequently, he exhorted them to raise the quality of officers and soldiers, rectify troop discipline, and strengthen officer and soldier training, achieving the three demands of "substantial," "elite troops," and "rapid," hoping to implement the doctrine of elite troops and modernize the Chinese army. After Chairman Chiang's speech, General Wedemeyer was invited to speak, concluding around 11:00 AM. The Chairman then personally led all the generals in 125 cars to the foot of Zijin Mountain to pay respects at the mausoleum of the national father, Mr. Sun Yat-sen. At 12:00 noon, they proceeded to the Wuliang Temple in Linggu Temple to hold a public memorial service for the fallen soldiers. After the ceremony, a picnic was held in the open space in front of the Memorial Tower for the Fallen Soldiers. Each person received a package of sandwiches, fruit, and refreshments. After eating, they were free to tour the scenic area for a while. The generals then returned to the city by military vehicle, bringing the historically significant Military Demobilization Conference to a successful conclusion.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 19th] At today's closing ceremony of the Military Demobilization Conference, General Wedemeyer, accompanied by General Collum, personally offered two points: (1) Recalling how, when he first came to China, he suggested gradually streamlining the original 370 divisions of the army to reduce and strengthen them, so that today the great task of resisting Japan could finally be completed. (Applause) He believed that China was a poor country and could not bear such large military expenditures for a long time. Even a wealthy country like the United States only allowed itself to have ten to twelve divisions in peacetime. (Applause) Next, he made an analogy regarding the adjustment of officer ranks. He said: Although he himself is currently a three-star general (Lieutenant General), when he returns to his country in the future and the original system is restored, he must remove two stars and regain his Major General title. But all of this is not worth mentioning. We thank God for His kindness in giving us the opportunity to serve. We can educate our children and enjoy a minimum standard of living, which is enough to satisfy us. (Loud applause) (2) The relationship between officers and soldiers must be strengthened. He said: After the American army stops marching, officers must first check the health, diet, nutrition, camping ground, and all equipment of the soldiers, and even whether the clothing is suitable, before paying attention to their personal needs. (Loud applause) In modern warfare, to seek the sacrifice of officers and soldiers and to have a unified determination, the relationship between officers and soldiers must first be strengthened. Finally, he said with great certainty that if Chinese officers can implement the Chairman's reorganization plan, the Chinese army will be modernized. If China succeeds in reorganizing its army and building the country, China will become a great, strong, prosperous country. His words were extremely insightful, and the audience applauded more than ten times.

### Zheng Jiemin Tells Our Reporter: Difficulties in the Mediation Department Have Passed; Military Situation in Shanxi Has Greatly Eased

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 18th] Tonight, at a cocktail party hosted by Ye Jianying, Zheng Jiemin told reporters that the major difficulties of the Mediation Department have been overcome. Currently, the only remaining issue is the surrender problem. The domestic surrender has been largely completed long ago and should not be a problem. According to the reporter's inquiries, the Mediation Department is currently discussing the procedures for restoring transportation. If the local groups have reached an agreement on restoring transportation, they can start restoring it according to the agreement without waiting. Yesterday, a transportation group departed for Botou on the Jinpu Line, with Peng Gunong as the government representative, Dang Renmin as the CCP representative, and Wedeton as the US representative. Today, two more transportation groups will depart, one for Qinglongqiao on the Guisui Line and one for Yuanshi on the Pinghan Line. The liaison group sent by the Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Communications to the Execution Department has begun its work.

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 18th] Since the Taiyuan and Houma groups of the Execution Department arrived in Shanxi, the military situation in Shanxi has eased in the past ten days. In the direction of Qin County on the Baijin Road southeast of Taiyuan, the Communist army has stopped attacking, but the threat to the defending troops has not been completely eliminated. The Taiyuan Central Group, composed of Major General Zou Lufu (government), Colonel Xu Guangda (Communist), and Colonel Heli, plans to go to Qin County within a day or two. The negotiation difficulties of the inspection group have been reported to the Execution Department for instructions, but there is still no news. According to the authorities in the war zone, Quwo and Xinlu, two cities only 20 miles away from Houma Station, are both owned by the National Army. On January 11, one month after the ceasefire order was issued, Houma Station, located between Quwo and Xinjiang, was suddenly occupied by the Communist army. It is said that the Communist army regards it as an important military location, so according to the ceasefire method, the National Army in Quwo and Xinjiang should withdraw a distance of 60 miles from Houma. Regarding the recent military conflicts, the reporter has not heard of any in Bingshi in a week, but officials said that a dozen days ago, six National Army transports were attacked by the Communist army in Dongmiaocun on their way to Wenshui, a National Army controlled area. All of them were captured and sent to Wenshui. The National Army's two-month salary was also robbed. As for the restoration of transportation, officials stated that the transportation lines from Taiyuan north to Datong, south to Linfen, and east to Shijiazhuang are all under the control of the National Army. The restoration of transportation only requires the Communist army not to destroy it again. After the CCP representative Xu Guangda and others arrived in Taiyuan from Datong by car on the 15th, they planned to rest for a while before starting work. US representative Colonel Heli told Xu that the sooner we start working, the sooner the people of Shanxi, who have suffered from the war, will have peace. So Xu and government and US representatives visited the cabinet official the next day and started working. Colonel Heli was fair and straightforward, and during the joint meeting on that day, he solemnly pointed out that if any party destroys it again in the future, they should be killed without mercy.

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 19th] The staff of the Mediation Execution Department will increase again, because each of the eight transportation groups needs many cadres. It is reported that the original plan was for 170 people, but now it has exceeded 200 people. Each group needs at least six people on each side to cope.

### Ministry of Communications Ordered to Repair Four Lines; Jinpu Road Gets Priority; Jiaoji, Longhai, and Pinggui Roads Repaired in Sequence

[United States News Agency, Beiping, 19th] The Mediation Executive Department announced today that the Ministry of Communications has been ordered to immediately engage in repairs at nine strongholds along the Jinpu, Jiaoji, Longhai, and Pinggui Roads. The Executive Department Railway Management Group has given priority to repairing the Jinpu Road, which runs through the north and south. Although 322 kilometers of track between Tianjin and Xuzhou has been damaged or damaged and cut into four sections, the repair work is much easier than the Pinghan Road, which is severely damaged. After the Jinpu Road is repaired and north-south traffic is re-established, communication in eastern China can be restored, and the economic and political stability of the entire region can be promoted materially. A team from the Railway Management Group has arrived in Botou, and with the assistance of engineers from the Ministry of Communications, has begun repair work towards Dezhou. Another team of engineers and management group personnel from the Ministry of Communications will be left in Yucheng, 35 miles northwest of Jinan, to advance northward to meet the personnel in Botou.

Premier's Proposal The Executive Yuan also passed Premier Song's proposal at today's routine meeting (to establish a textile machine manufacturing company with government assistance). The original text of the proposal is as follows: It has been found that there are many textile machine factories taken over from the enemy and puppets this time. Based on their equipment, the spindles and looms needed in my country can be supplied domestically after several years of sorting out and expansion. The China Textile Construction Company will be completely transferred to commercial operation after two years, so the manufacture of textile machines should be mainly commercial at this time, and the government should give strong assistance to promote its success. It is now proposed to evaluate the textile machine factories taken over and use them as government shares to serve as the foundation for the establishment. In addition, commercial shares should be solicited as much as possible to serve as capital, and a textile machine manufacturing company should be organized in accordance with the provisions of the Company Law. If the commercial shares are insufficient, the government will allocate funds to join the government shares. The current textile factories of various merchants can actively subscribe for shares, and the company can be formally established within this month. The government shares in the company can also be sold to commercial shares at any time, so that the government's original intention of promoting commercial operation can be implemented. Is this feasible? Please decide.

### New Life Movement Celebrated in Various Places

### Repatriation of Japanese Prisoners of War and Nationals in North China Expected to Conclude Within Five Months

[Our Newspaper's Beiping Dispatch of the 19th] Currently, there are over 240,000 Japanese prisoners of war and nationals remaining in the four provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan. If transportation on all lines is reliably restored, it is hoped that they can all be repatriated to their home country via Tanggu within five months. According to the relevant authorities of the 11th War Area, the 11th War Area originally had 114,899 Japanese prisoners of war and 217,544 Japanese nationals. After the surrender, 75,813 Japanese prisoners of war and 75,585 Japanese nationals have already been repatriated. A total of 151,396 Japanese nationals have not yet been repatriated. This work is already being handled by our country. Currently, General Liu Xuesong, the commander of the Tanggu Fortress, is responsible at Tanggu. However, the dispatch of ships and the security work from Tanggu to Dengzhou are now the responsibility of the U.S. Navy's First Division, or will be assisted by them. Lieutenant General Melasky stated that the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war and nationals will not be completed, and the organization he presides over will not be concluded for even a single day. The agreement between China and the United States on the repatriation of prisoners stipulates that China shall, upon notification from the U.S., detain and hand over to the U.S. any prisoners of war or nationals from the concentration camps deemed to be war criminals by the U.S. The work of educating Japanese prisoners of war and nationals has already begun in the Japanese prisoner of war concentration camp in Xiyuan, Beiping.

### Japanese Troops in Northeast China and Korea Not Repatriated by the Soviets, Apparently Undergoing Training for Future Use

[United Press, Chongqing, Dispatch of the 19th] According to well-informed government sources, the United Press reporter was told today that, as of now, the Soviet Union has shown no signs of preparing to repatriate Japanese troops from Northeast China, North Korea, Sakhalin Island, or the Kuril Islands. On the other hand, the Soviets are apparently training these troops for future use. The fighting in Northeast China, North Korea, Sakhalin Island, and the Kuril Islands was very short, and the number of Japanese casualties in the fighting against the Soviets before the end of the war was relatively small. After the Soviet Union entered the war, the Japanese had twelve divisions stationed in Northeast China, three divisions in North Korea, and another division defending Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands. In addition, there were railway guard units, border guard units, and armed Japanese residents. The total number of Japanese troops in these areas is estimated at 500,000. It is learned that although stubborn senior officers in the Kwantung Army have been imprisoned, generally speaking, only a small proportion of the Japanese troops have been detained by the Soviets. According to the information obtained, the Soviet army has divided the Japanese troops into three categories: (1) Leaders and commanders, mostly belonging to the "young and vigorous faction." (2) All Japanese prisoners of war with anti-Soviet sentiments, who are currently undergoing political indoctrination. (3) Japanese troops who have no anti-Soviet sentiments or strong political beliefs, who are now playing an important role in organizing Japanese civilians under Soviet supervision. According to well-informed government sources, the Japanese troops who have been disarmed are prohibited from communicating with their families. They have learned that life in their home country is extremely difficult, and as a result, a large number of them do not want to return home. The training program includes various principles such as democracy and social revolution, the future of Japan, and a people's autonomous government to replace foreign control.

### Marshall to Fly to Taiyuan to Inspect the Implementation of the Ceasefire Order in Shanxi

[Our Newspaper's Beiping Dispatch of the 18th] Marshall will fly to Taiyuan within the week to personally inspect the implementation of the ceasefire order in Shanxi. Zhou Enlai and Zhang Zhizhong will accompany him. The Taiyuan authorities have already begun preparations to welcome him.

[Our Newspaper's Beiping Dispatch of the 18th] This newspaper's reporter arrived in Taiyuan on the 11th by plane of the Executive Headquarters, and is still the first reporter from the rear of Chongqing to visit Taiyuan after its recovery. The enemy ruled this city for eight years, leaving behind nothing new except for a New Malu Road and countless piles of garbage blocking the roads. The roads inside and outside the city have been in disrepair for eight years, full of bumps and flying dust; the city houses are mostly leaning walls and dilapidated, crumbling. Of the more than 30 factories that Mr. Yan Xishan painstakingly managed before the war in the north of the city, except for the heavy and difficult-to-move parts of the steel plant, 60% of the machines in the other factories were moved to the northeast by the Japanese. The remaining machines have also been excessively used, worn out, and damaged. Fortunately, Mr. Yan Xishan took over quickly, and there was no loss of factory machinery and materials before and after the Japanese surrender. Since the ceasefire order was issued, especially after the arrival of the Taiyuan team of the Executive Headquarters, this ancient city with 150,000 people has been filled with a peaceful atmosphere. More than 200 shops have opened, and the narrow streets are crowded with pedestrians, mostly military and political personnel returning from western Shanxi in gray cotton uniforms, and farmers in tattered clothes coming to the city for sightseeing. Japanese soldiers and nationals have been rarely seen on the streets recently. The public security situation in the surrounding villages is still good. People entering and leaving the city gates must be checked for residence permits. All primary and secondary schools in the city have started classes, but they all lack funds and complete desks and chairs, and face many difficulties. The National Revolutionary University, which has been long overdue, was reopened in Bingzhou on New Year's Day. Governor Yan still serves as the president of the university, and Liang Huazhi serves as the dean of education. There are more than 200 students. Shanxi University has not yet been moved back from the west. There are four newspapers: Zhenzhong, Fuxing, Minzhong, and Guomin, and one evening newspaper, Minzhong Wanbao. The puppet Allied currency has not yet been exchanged here. General transactions are based on the legal tender, so the black market exchange rate of the Allied currency to the legal tender is about six yuan to one yuan. There is a branch of the Agricultural Bank of China here, which is solely responsible for agricultural loans. Most of the wired telephones in the province have been destroyed. The radio station of the Ministry of Transportation's Telegraph Bureau can communicate with Beiping and Xi'an. Railway transportation: the Zhengtai Line has been unimpeded since the ceasefire order was issued, and the Tongpu Line can barely reach Datong in the north and Linfen in the south.

It is hidden that the development of the Canadian government's investigation of the leakage of atomic secrets and government secrets information may affect the United States. It is rumored that the Canadian government cannot point out a certain country involved in the case due to diplomatic treaty relations. This statement is inaccurate. According to Ministry of Foreign Affairs personnel, when the 22 people currently detained in the secret chamber of the camp office are tried in whole or in part in the future, the foreign country will be pointed out. According to unofficial government sources, the foreign country is the Soviet Union.

[United Press, Ottawa Dispatch of the 19th] In the Canadian government's investigation of the leakage of atomic secrets and government secrets information, the police are still arresting suspects and detaining witnesses. It is heard that among those detained, one person seems to be at the vice-ministerial level. [Also Montreal Dispatch] The Montreal Evening News reported that the Canadian police searched McGill University, the Foreign Exchange Administration, the telephone company, and the University of Montreal (that is, the location of the National Research Institute) here last Friday, and captured six people related to the atomic secrets leakage case. The city police have been secretly following the tracks of Russians for several months. [Also Ottawa Dispatch] The Canadian government's investigation of the leakage of classified information is now linked to the investigation of the uranium production site of the Duraldu Gold Mine. According to the Montreal Daily News, Soviet agents attempted to purchase black market uranium ore for 500,000 Canadian dollars, but the buyer did not move the uranium ore out of Canada. The government bought the mine not long ago and announced an investigation.

[United Press, Ottawa Dispatch of the 18th] The Ottawa Police Department revealed today that the person who exposed the large espionage network in Canada was Gouzenko, a young counselor at the Soviet Embassy in Canada. He, his wife, and young children are guarded and protected by the Canadian police. Gouzenko approached the city police department in the second half of last year and secretly reported a large espionage network spread throughout Canada. It is learned that the police department immediately sent personnel to monitor his movements. In September of last year, the police detained four Russians in Gouzenko's apartment and searched his residence. Two of them were former Soviet Embassy officials.

[Central News Agency, New York Dispatch of the 18th] The Toronto Star reported that the Soviet Ambassador to Canada, Zarubin, left Canada for Moscow a month ago because he knew that Canada would announce the Soviet affair.

[United Press, Moscow Dispatch of the 19th] Soviet newspapers today published a statement by Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King regarding foreign envoys stealing secret information, but did not comment on it.

[French News Agency, Ottawa Dispatch of the 18th] Regarding the arrest of a Canadian official in the United Kingdom, Construction Minister Howe recently said that this matter is not related to the atomic secrets leakage case. The official has not yet provided detailed explanations on this matter. According to certain sources, what was leaked was probably secrets related to radar or "Iroquois radio." The Minister of National Defense also announced that information about "Iroquois radio" was exchanged with the Soviet Union during the war. As for rumors that Canada would sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, there is no such thing. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a statement denying it. It is widely rumored here that a well-known industrialist has already been arrested, but this has not been confirmed.

[United Press, Ottawa Dispatch of the 19th] It is learned that Canada has cancelled 25 orders, including Soviet orders worth approximately 24 million US dollars, because the Soviet Union believes that the terms are "too harsh." The government solemnly stated that this move is purely a commercial negotiation and has nothing to do with the government's investigation of alleged Soviet intelligence agent activity in Canada.

### Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Davies, Defends the Soviet Union; If Atomic Bomb Secrets Are Not Shared, the Soviet Union Has the Right to Steal Them Through Espionage for Self-Defense

[United Press, Havana Dispatch of the 18th] Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Davies, told the United Press reporter here alone today that if the Soviet Union is denied the sharing of atomic bomb secrets by its former allies who fought side by side, then for self-defense, it is morally justified in stealing them through military espionage. The U.S. and British policy of strict denial, judging by its meaning, is no less than a hostile act. Major powers deploying intelligence networks to spy on other countries' military intelligence has not started today. The U.S. and Britain do not want the Russians to know the atomic secrets, almost treating the Russians like children. In fact, the Soviet Union has no shortage of talented scientists who can develop atomic tactics in their own laboratories within two years. For the present, if we do not achieve mutual trust and cooperation among the major powers, then we can only repeat the old tricks of power politics. The two cannot be combined. The Soviet Union now needs peace to recuperate. The current chaotic suspicions among the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union should be swept away. Without this, we can only engage in large-scale competition, rush to build arsenals and scientific laboratories, and end up in a great war of total destruction. The Soviet Union today is afraid of British imperialism, just as Britain is afraid of the Soviet Union's ambition for its lifeline in the eastern Mediterranean, oil fields, and interests in India and China. The diplomatic chess game is full of intrigue, with each move tightly contested. When will this open and secret struggle between the three powers end?

### Japanese Battleship Nagato to be Used for Atomic Bomb Tests

[United Press, Nagato Bay, Tokyo Dispatch of the 19th] The former flagship Nagato, which the Japanese Navy originally took pride in, is now battered by repeated air raids and in disrepair, no longer possessing its former grandeur. The ship will set sail again soon, but this time it will be flying the American flag, and its mission will be to test the power of atomic bombs. In addition, the Japanese light cruiser Sakawa is also raising steam and is ready to depart to Bikini Atoll for atomic bomb testing.

### Withdrawal Plans for British and French Troops in Syria and Lebanon to Proceed Soon Through Negotiations

[Reuters, London Dispatch of the 19th] Since the British and French military representatives began negotiations in Beirut last December on the withdrawal of British and French troops from the Levant region, they have been deadlocked. However, they received the same instructions from the British and French governments yesterday, and the deadlock can be broken. This is the result of British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault resolving to re-establish the opinion of the majority of the members of the United Nations Security Council last Saturday in favor of continuing negotiations on troop withdrawal. The British and French military representatives in Beirut have received this instruction. Now that the deadlock has been broken, the next stage will be to hold consultations with the Syrian and Lebanese authorities to agree on a plan for troop withdrawal.

### Iranian Delegation Arrives in Soviet Union; Molotov Personally Welcomes Them at the Airport

[Our Newspaper's News] London Broadcast of the 19th stated that the Iranian delegation arrived in Moscow today, and Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov personally welcomed them at the airport.

[Reuters, Tehran Dispatch of the 19th] Iranian Prime Minister Saed, along with the Iranian mission, flew to Moscow yesterday morning. Three members of the mission, including Datari, General Firooz, and Deputy Minister of Commerce Volfsi, have not yet departed. When the mission took off, Soviet Embassy personnel greeted them at the airport.

### Can Underground Cities Prevent Atomic Bombs?

[French News Agency, Washington Dispatch of the 18th] Hutchins, a professor at the University of Chicago who contributed greatly to the invention of the atomic bomb, reported to the House Armed Services Committee today that the atomic bomb is only the beginning of weapons of terror, and we will have even more terrible bombs in the future. We need peace, or we will invite our own destruction. The only way to solve this problem now is to organize a "world government." The world-renowned mathematician and inventor of relativity, Professor Einstein, once said that if an atomic war breaks out, two-thirds of the U.S. population will be wiped out. This is indeed an exaggeration. The only effective defense method is to build an underground city that is 50 miles long, 1.5 miles wide, and 800 yards deep.

### World Trade Conference to be Held in the Second Half of the Year

[French News Agency, London Dispatch of the 18th] The United Nations Economic and Social Council announced its adjournment today, pending its reconvening at a temporary site in New York on May 25. Before adjourning, it decided to convene a world trade conference in the second half of this year.

[Central News Agency, London Dispatch of the 18th] The UN Economic and Social Council appointed the following countries as members of the Narcotics Commission tonight: China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, India, the Netherlands, Canada, Mexico, Turkey, Egypt, Iran, Yugoslavia, Peru, and Poland.

### Four-Nation Investigation Team to Survey the Southern Border of Italy

[United Press, London Dispatch of the 18th] According to responsible sources, representatives of the foreign ministers of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States formed an investigation team today to go to Trieste to survey the area and then make recommendations on the re-determination of the border between Italy and Yugoslavia. The foreign ministers' representatives held two meetings this morning and afternoon to discuss the organization of the investigation team so that the team could depart as soon as possible.

### Britain Dispatches Mission to India to Resolve Serious Situation; Delegation Includes Three Cabinet Ministers; Riots Erupt Again in Bombay Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's News] London Broadcast of the 19th stated that in view of the seriousness of the situation in India, the British government will organize a mission to India for negotiations. The mission will include ministers from the British Cabinet, and its importance is self-evident. According to British government officials, this trip by the mission is not only related to the future of 400 million people in India, but also to world peace.

[Our Newspaper's News] London Broadcast of the 19th stated that the British mission, which is flying to India with an extremely important mission, includes three key members of the British Cabinet: (1) Secretary of State for India, Lawrence, (2) Minister of Commerce, Cripps, (3) Sea Minister, Alexander. It is heard that the mission is equivalent to the British Cabinet stationed in India, and its powers and tasks are extremely important.

[Reuters, Bombay Dispatch of the 19th] The Bombay government issued a statement today stating that the disturbances at the Royal Indian Navy's Talwar Camp (naval facilities) have spread to other naval facilities today. A large number of strikers poured into the streets and engaged in hostile acts. In the morning, the strikers seized several Indian Navy trucks and drove them recklessly in the streets, shouting slogans and ordering shopkeepers to close their shops. Before noon, most of the marchers had been dispersed and returned to their barracks. The police were attacked by strikers with iron rods and wooden sticks, and three people were injured. Most of the strikers demanded the release of Captain Rashid, an officer of the "Indian National Army" under the protection of the Japanese, who has been sentenced to seven years in prison. The riots in Calcutta four days ago were also caused by this. After today's disturbances, the strikers returned to Talwar Camp, and their leader said, "Today's holiday has passed. The message we give to the British government is to get out of India."

### International Judges Appointed to Try Major Japanese War Criminals; Occupation Courts Established in Japan; New Zealand Troops Leave Italy for Japan

[Reuters, Tokyo Dispatch of the 19th] MacArthur yesterday appointed Australian Chief Deputy Justice Webb (Chief Justice of Queensland) as the president of the International Military Tribunal to try major Japanese war crime suspects. The other judges of the court who have been announced by MacArthur are Patrick (United Kingdom), McDougall (Canada), Mei Ru'ao (China), Public Prosecutor Reboul (France), Rohling (Netherlands), Northcroft (New Zealand), Zayanov (Soviet Union), and Higgins (United States).

[French News Agency, Tokyo Dispatch of the 18th] Military occupation courts will soon be organized throughout Japan in accordance with MacArthur's orders. These courts will be responsible for trying all kinds of crimes against the occupying forces, including refusing to provide information and illegally trading in U.S. military supplies. All of these are not prohibited by Japanese law. Nationals of the Allied countries will also be judged by these courts in the future. Each court also has the power to impose the death penalty, but it must be approved by MacArthur.

[Reuters, Wellington Dispatch of the 19th] The main force of the New Zealand Brigade of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan is scheduled to depart from Italy today and arrive in Japan on March 28.

### Overseas Chinese Wanting To Return From Japan Must Register

[United Press, Tokyo Dispatch of the 19th] MacArthur Headquarters announced today that Chinese, Koreans, and Taiwanese currently in Japan must register before March 18. The order stated that anyone who does not express a desire to return home will be deemed to have automatically waived their rights.

[United Press, Tokyo Dispatch of the 19th] The Japanese Minister of Health announced today that the transportation problem for Chinese people currently in Japan who wish to return home will be resolved by early March.

### After the Yalta Agreement Announcement: The Permanent Peace of the Far East Falls into the Mist, The Three Eastern Provinces Still Occupied Like a Cuckoo in a Sparrow's Nest, The Fruits of Our Victory Are Stolen

[United Press, Washington, 18th] The announcement of the Yalta Secret Agreement has aroused indignation in China, and the hope for permanent peace in the Far East has once again fallen into a heavy fog. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty recognizes the independence of Outer Mongolia and agrees to grant the Soviet Union various economic rights in the Three Eastern Provinces. The Chinese people will also view this as a result of coercion by Britain and the United States to allow the Soviet Union to participate in the Pacific War. China's resentment towards the United States may dissipate because of the hope for post-war assistance in large-scale construction. However, it is not yet clear how its attitude towards the Soviet Union will change. China has little concern for the Kuril Islands, but what was signed away in the Sino-Soviet Treaty is the lifeblood. The independence of Outer Mongolia has been rejected by China for many years. The Sino-Japanese War began in the Three Eastern Provinces, with the intention of driving Japan out of Northeast China, but as a result of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, Japan has left, and the Soviet Union has come. The Three Eastern Provinces are still occupied like a cuckoo in a sparrow's nest. The current sentiment prevailing in China is that the Soviet Union is trying to obtain rights beyond the treaty. There have been mass demonstrations in Chongqing demanding that the Soviet Union withdraw from the Three Eastern Provinces, that the content of Sino-Soviet negotiations be made public, and that the Soviet Union abide by the treaty. In China, demonstrations often start with insignificant people, on a small scale, but sometimes grasp the public's psychology, spread rapidly, and turn into a nationwide movement, not only involving China in the war, but also inevitably involving countries far across the West Pacific. After World War I, China discovered that there were secret agreements between the powers to cede Jiaozhou Bay to Japan, so as to induce Japan to withdraw and confront Germany, so that Japan could further strengthen its position in Northeast China. The Yalta Agreement is similar, and China has once again discovered that part of the fruits of its victory have been stolen.

### Mummy From 6,000 Years Ago

Discovered in a Golden Coffin

[United Press, Cairo, 19th] French archaeologist Professor Montet announced today the discovery of a golden coffin containing a 6,000-year-old mummy, along with precious jewelry. The mummy is of an ancient general.

[Reuters, Cairo, 19th] A Frenchman discovered a tomb in the Denice area east of the Nile River, finding the tomb of a general of the 21st Dynasty intact. It contained many treasures, including three gold cups, multiple gold vessels, a gold Hathor goddess statue, and a hanging lamp, the exquisiteness of which is comparable to the treasures in Tutankhamun's tomb.

### French-Vietnamese Negotiations Underway; If They Fail, France Prepares to Use Force

[United Press, Saigon, 18th] Responsible parties announced today that the French Special Envoy to Northern Vietnam, Sainteny, and the President of the Independent Republic of Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh, have held several long negotiations in Hanoi. Judging from various signs, if the negotiations fail, the French army is prepared to use force to crush the resistance of the Annamese people. 4,000 troops from the French colonial forces have arrived in Laos. Reinforcements, including tanks and infantry, are also arriving in West Siam. At least three regiments of Vietnamese troops originally stationed in France will arrive as reinforcements within two weeks.

[French News Agency, Hanoi, 18th] According to Saigon news, the French army has captured the commander of the 4th Division under the Viet Minh government.

[French News Agency, Paris, 18th] Interim President Gouin held a long meeting today with Admiral d'Argenlieu, the French High Commissioner to Vietnam, who recently returned home.

### Vatican Ceremony

Thomas Tien Ken-sin Installed as Cardinal

[United Press, Vatican, 18th] The Holy See held a ceremony today for the installation of 32 cardinals. The Pope sat on a long throne covered with red velvet, delivered a brief five-minute speech (the text of which was in yesterday's newspaper), and then announced the names of the new bishops. Each person then removed their biretta according to ancient custom to indicate their acceptance of the appointment. The ceremony today broke convention by allowing women to attend. The 32 new cardinals come from 19 countries on six continents and speak ten different languages. Among them, Tien Ken-sin is the first Chinese cardinal. Seven are from the Western Hemisphere, four from the United States, and three each from Britain, France, and Germany. Note: Bishop Tien was born on October 24, 1890, in Yanggu County, Shandong Province. He studied at several Catholic schools in the province, became a Catholic priest at the age of 24, joined the Society of the Divine Word in 1932, and was promoted to bishop in 1939.

### Chinese Women Married to Americans Allowed into U.S.

U.S. House of Representatives Passes Bill

[United Press, Washington, 18th] The House of Representatives today passed a bill allowing qualified Chinese wives of American citizens to enter the United States, regardless of the annual quota of 105 Chinese immigrants to the United States. This bill has now been transferred to the Senate for discussion.

### Japanese Emperor Tours Bombed Areas Without Escort

[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] Emperor Hirohito of Japan began touring the bombed areas of the Tokyo-Yokohama industrial district at 9 a.m. this morning. The trip lasted six hours. He traveled through the city by car with almost no escort, which is unprecedented in Japanese history.

### Paper Coffins

Invented by German Funeral Home Workers

[United Press, Berlin, 19th] German funeral home workers, due to the urgent need for wood as fuel, invented coffins made of paper instead of wood or metal. Some funeral home workers have purchased paper for wrapping corpses, while others are solemnly placing corpses in coffins in preparation for memorial services in churches and at graves. However, once the mourners have dispersed, the corpses are removed, and the coffins are emptied and reused.

### Britain Sets June 8th to Celebrate Victory Over Germany and Japan

The President of the Belgian Catholic Party, Huysmans, has been ordered to consult with leaders of various parties on the formation of a cabinet.

The British government will announce the continued implementation of compulsory military service for some time.

### Local Correspondence

Songjiang

Old Case of Conspiracy to Murder Husband Reopened

Zhang, the wife of Weng Huanting, a resident of Xupu Township in Punnan, cohabited with Wang Boyu. Because Boyu blinded Huanting, and their adulterous affair had been discovered, he conspired with Li A'si to kill Huanting at an opportune moment. A'si pretended to be a robber, breaking into Huanting's house, tying up the people, and searching the place, intending to make the family of the deceased believe that Huanting's death was at the hands of robbers. This incident occurred in April of the 33rd year [of the Republic]. At that time, Boyu had considerable influence, so he was not reported. Now that victory has arrived, the local Self-Defense Corps arrested Wang Boyu and Li A'si on the 8th of this month. After interrogation, they confessed and have been sent to the county to be dealt with according to the law. Weng Xiding, the brother of the deceased, has also filed a lawsuit with the prosecutor's office, requesting an investigation.

Wuxi

Strike Triggered by Allegations of Extortion

Qingyang Town, which belongs to Cheng County and borders Wuxi, was the site of a gambling den operating during the Lantern Festival evening at the Zhenxin Teahouse. A patrol team from the police station passed by, and instead of prohibiting the gambling operation, the police entered to drink tea. When the patrol reached the Jia Family Ancestral Hall on South Street, residents Xia Liang and Xia Boshou were playing with dragon cards at home. Without asking the reason, the police took them away and searched Xia Liang's pocket, confiscating 1,000 Customs Gold Units. When the police passed by the Zhenxin Teahouse, the gambling was still continuing. Xia Liang and others felt aggrieved and argued with the police, who then released Xia Liang and the other. However, the next morning, Xia Liang and Xia Boshou were arrested again, which aroused the public anger of the townspeople. All the shops in the town went on strike on the 17th. A petition was sent to the Sixth District Office, and the district chief, Xu Zukun, advised them to open the shops first and wait for a legal resolution. The merchants and residents refused to open their shops, vowing not to resume business until the police chief was dismissed and investigated.

Zhenjiang

Executive Yuan Appropriates Funds to Repair Dikes

[Central News Agency] The Jiangsu Provincial Government reported that the Jiangnan Seawall and the Jiangbei Canal embankment were severely damaged, with gaps and holes, posing extreme danger. As the spring flood season is approaching, measures should be taken to prevent problems before they occur. Engineering bureaus have been established to send engineering personnel to conduct surveying, design, and estimation work. Plans to repair the Jiangnan Seawall and plans to dredge the Jiangbei Canal waterway have been drafted and telegraphed to the Executive Yuan requesting appropriation of funds for timely repairs to ensure the lives and property of millions of people. (Telegraph text omitted)

Sheng County

Township and Deputy Chiefs Accused of Colluding with the Enemy

Qiu Zhu, the township chief of Chongren Town in Sheng County, Zhejiang, and Deputy Chief Qiu Wan Guanqin, etc., are local tyrants and gentry. In the 16th year of the Republic [1927], they instructed local teams to destroy the county and district Kuomintang offices, a matter on record. Since the fall of eastern Zhejiang and the occupation of Shengcheng by Japanese troops, the Kuomintang party, government, and military were forced to withdraw westward. The township chief took advantage of the opportunity to collude with the enemy and puppets to exploit the villagers. At that time, due to the environment, government orders were difficult to implement. After the surrender of Japan, the National Government explicitly exempted land taxes, and the provincial government also suspended borrowing. However, the township and deputy chiefs still extorted funds. Qiu Zhemin and other fellow villagers in Shanghai jointly filed a factual complaint, listing 14 counts of their crimes. It is reported that the Zhejiang Supervisory Commissioner's Office has sent personnel to investigate and report to the Supervisory Yuan for verification and handling. Chairman Huang has also instructed the Civil Affairs Department to instruct the Sheng County Government to investigate and handle the matter.

### Eradicating the Remaining Mist of Nazism, Overcoming National Weaknesses, Rebuilding Berlin

— Special Correspondent Xu Chengbin stationed in Britain

The Berlin City Government, under the supervision of the four Allied military administrations, recently held an exhibition to report on its work progress over the past six months. In terms of figures, the situation in Berlin has gradually returned to normal. As Eisenhower said, no one knew how to begin rebuilding Berlin. The destruction was thorough and unprecedented. In London and Chongqing, we can occasionally see the remains of air raids on standing houses, but in Berlin, you first see a ruin, and then, by the side of the street, you might find a house with its roof gone but its foundation still standing. Today, residents live in those houses that were not completely destroyed by the bombardment. A tarpaulin, a few piles of straw, meet the most pressing needs. The silence in the streets matches the name of a dead city. Occasionally, you see an old man pushing a cart of firewood home, but there is no other sign of life.

However, with the help of the Allied forces and the relief from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, Berlin has overcome several unbelievable difficulties. Although there is a shortage of essential goods, there is no panic. At the very least, life can still be sustained. Apart from the constant influx of refugees, the housing problem has been temporarily resolved. Houses that have not suffered much damage are being repaired. If there were not a shortage of materials, the progress could be more satisfactory. Gas and electricity have been restored, but are under strict control. Coal is absolutely unavailable. Everyone is looking for wood to burn for warmth. Food distribution is based on work ability. Those who do not work do not get anything. In the past two months, the British, American, Soviet, and French authorities have been able to distribute according to the planned program and moderately increase the quality of the lowest level of distribution. The situation after the spring may improve further.

Social life is also gradually returning to normal. The subway, buses, and trams have mostly been restored. Schools have purged the remnants of Nazism, revised textbooks, and have reopened. The list of university faculty members has been finalized, and students can enroll after their qualifications have been reviewed.

Learning Labor Skills, Planning Small-Scale Production

Out of the three million residents, one million are working under the guidance of the city government. The number of idle people is 500,000, but most of them are old and weak and unable to work. Therefore, the percentage of working people to the total population is extremely high. Officials who used to work in companies and institutions now have to change careers. Training technicians and redefining the scope of professions have become a temporary necessity. When companies and institutions will be revived is unknown. The most urgent need is to fundamentally rebuild society, learn labor skills, and plan small-scale production.

Regulations Mandate Food for Workers, Arresting Black Market Merchants

Berlin's laws stipulate that "those who work shall eat," but there are still people who do not work. Many people accumulated money during the war, and those who have money can buy things. Most of these people with capital buy food and daily necessities on the black market. The Allied authorities are doing their best to arrest black market merchants and cannot say that they have not achieved anything. However, since Germany is divided into four zones, and the regulations in the four zones are not unified, and the police system is not complete, violations are difficult to avoid.

This is the outer appearance of Berlin life. From the armistice to today, from complete chaos to today's order, it has not been an easy period. This achievement depends on the cooperation between the Allied forces and the German people. The Allied forces issue orders and supply materials; the German people execute the orders and work hard. Their strong obedience and high work efficiency have reduced many difficulties. They know that to improve their current living conditions, they have to rely on their own efforts.

The Difficult Winter Has Passed, The Road Ahead Is Still Thorny

Winter was a difficult hurdle. The mortality rate among the old and young has been very high. The cold weather made life an even more serious problem. Due to effective prevention, infectious diseases have not spread widely, but long-term malnutrition and disease have become common phenomena.

In short, the Germans are doing their best to struggle. They do not have feelings of self-pity. Their characteristic is a sense of responsibility. The Germans feel that the initiators of the war were the Nazi Party, and they were only obeying military orders, so they cannot be considered criminals. This is the weakness that the German nation is still displaying. They cannot see their fundamental mistakes, and they need re-education.

Naturally, they also need daily necessities. Starving people do not have the mood to talk about democracy and freedom. (8th)

### Ties Must Not Be Swapped

There is an American saying: "Ties must not be swapped." This is how the Allied forces are dealing with German war criminals and their civilians in Germany: war criminals are punished with deserved sentences, while the civilians are given thorough re-education. The targets are different, and the methods of dealing with them also differ. "Ties must not be swapped," this is what it means.

### Europe's Largest Airport to Appear

This newspaper's London Aviation News

British Commercial Aviation has announced plans to build Europe's largest airport. According to the plan, Heathrow Airport, currently under construction outside London, will be expanded by more than two times. It will occupy 4,000 acres, with a runway 15,000 feet long, and two additional runways of 90 feet and 6,000 feet long. If necessary, more can be added. The new airport will be equipped with the latest equipment, and transportation between the airport and various parts of Britain is also under study.

The plan will be submitted to the Parliament for review and is expected to be approved. Before the new airport can be built, some highways must be diverted, and some villages must be demolished. The purchase of private land and price negotiations will also be complicated.

Currently, the world's largest commercial airport is New York's Idlewild Airport. The airport is also under expansion, and the final area will reach [blank], already in sight. (Xu Chengbin)

### A Few Opinions on Salt Administration Reform (Part 1)

— Xu Erxin

The salt administration system in our country has evolved through successive dynasties, each with its unique characteristics. Books and records describe it in great detail, but it can generally be divided into three types: tax-free system, taxation system, and exclusive purchase system. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, it has inherited the flawed policies of the late Qing Dynasty, continuing without change, resulting in deeply ingrained malpractices. In most areas, it remains a system where merchants are invited to bid for coastal areas, transport salt after paying taxes, or where merchants contract to handle salt and pay taxes as a form of commercial monopoly. However, in areas where merchants fail to deliver salt, or where illegal salt from nearby fields is rampant and the authorities cannot compete with private operations, government management is adopted. After a short period, its abolition is discussed, or freedom is restored, or even reverted to commercial management. Reforms are inconsistent, and right and wrong are confused, with no fixed system to speak of.

Since the national government established its capital in Nanjing, it has strived for reform. In March of the 20th year, the Legislative Yuan formulated the Salt Law, consisting of seven chapters and thirty-nine articles, adopting a system of taxation at the production site, allowing people to freely buy and sell salt. This is undoubtedly a relatively complete salt system. However, our country has a vast territory, and the situations in various regions are complex and unique. Salt production areas are spread across the country, with sea salt, well salt, pond salt, and rock salt all available. Production methods include sun-drying, boiling, or natural crystallization, all depending on the location, making the industry scattered and different from other countries. In these circumstances, the management of production sites is extremely difficult. Before production site management becomes truly strict, this system of taxation at the production site and free trade is significantly hindered by the current salt affairs situation in our country. If enforced forcibly, illegal salt will inevitably flood the market, severely affecting tax revenue. The detailed reasons are discussed in my book "Discussion on Salt Monopoly" (published in the Hong Kong "Financial Review," Volume 5, Number 5). As the victory in the War of Resistance is celebrated and national reconstruction work urgently needs to be carried out, rectifying tax revenue and enriching finances are of the utmost importance. Therefore, I dare to express my humble opinions based on years of research on salt affairs, hoping to provide references and contribute to joint discussions.

Taxation at the Production Site

In the system of allowing people to freely buy and sell, the government's sole purpose is taxation. Although the procedure is simplified and easy to implement, it is feared that it is not applicable to a country with complex situations like ours. Salt, being a necessity for people's food, cannot be absent even for a day and can also be used for agriculture, industry, medicine, and military affairs. Its importance is no less than that of grain. The government should not only aim to tax it for financial purposes but should also consider regulating food supply, balancing supply and demand (because salt is not like rice and wheat, which have other food substitutes), and increasing production to meet the needs of various industries during the reconstruction period and avoid shortages. In the past era of commercial contracting, merchants were profit-oriented. They often regarded remote areas with difficult transportation as undesirable and were unwilling to transport salt there. These areas often faced the fear of salt shortages. Even those who ventured to transport salt there, because of the high risks and costs, would inevitably hoard and raise prices, or adulterate the salt with mud and sand, resulting in poor quality. However, because salt sales in various regions were allocated according to population with fixed annual quotas, the government still adopted a management system. If merchants did not go, the government would transport salt to meet the people's needs. Once a system of taxation at the production site is adopted, allowing people to freely buy and sell, and the government does not intervene, remote areas will be neglected by merchants and not supplied by the government. Salt, unlike other commodities, has no substitutes. Daily shortages will inevitably cause serious panic about salt shortages. Furthermore, the methods of salt production in our country, whether sun-drying or boiling, have different complexities and advantages, or natural production without human intervention, resulting in different costs. Merchants are profit-driven, and salt produced in areas with higher costs will likely find no buyers, resulting in production without sales. Salt farmers rely on salt production for a living and cannot easily change careers. If the salt they produce is neither bought by merchants nor collected by the government, resulting in a breakdown in sales channels, it will inevitably lead to a serious panic about their livelihoods. Without finding ways to smuggle salt, they will be unable to sustain their lives. Even with strict laws and severe punishments, it will be impossible to stop them.

Government Monopoly System

I believe that the most suitable salt system for our country is to refer to the successful rules of past dynasties, consider the trends of the world, and adopt a government monopoly system. The so-called government monopoly method is based on private production with government production as a supplement, government purchase, transportation, and sales as the main focus, and commercial sales as a supplement. The reasons for this are explained separately below:

(1) Our country's salt production is extremely rich, and a large number of people rely on salt production for their livelihoods. Before the government has an overall plan, it can only allow them to continue production, providing guidance on how to improve production methods to achieve refinement. However, this type of privately produced salt is often unclean, containing other components, and of extremely poor quality, which has long been criticized by foreigners. Besides private production, the government should consider establishing salt production companies and can also absorb social capital, jointly operated by government and business, using machinery to produce salt, or encourage salt farmers to raise funds themselves to establish companies to manufacture with machinery, in order to demonstrate improvement and meet the needs of both domestic and foreign markets.

(2) The government purchase of field salt has been the most complete method in the salt system of our country's past dynasties. The benefits of government purchase include: (1) Salt farmers can concentrate on production, as their income is secure. (2) The salt produced by salt farmers is collected as soon as it is produced, without any stagnation, which is beneficial (in the past, salt collection had fixed quotas, and production was limited, so salt farmers often smuggled surplus salt, or merchants privately collected surplus salt, smuggled it, or officials who were not honest bought surplus salt for profit). Salt farmers voluntarily hand over all salt to the government, unwilling to smuggle it, and field smuggling can be fundamentally eliminated. (3) All salt farmers must hand over their salt to the government and do not contact merchants, thus reducing the opportunity for smuggling. The malpractice of unscrupulous merchants distributing and transporting salt with heavy weights is avoided.

(3) Our country's salt system has always emphasized government transportation. The Tang Dynasty had the system of "gang transport," and the Song Dynasty implemented official transportation. During the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, government transportation was generally used in remote areas where transportation was difficult and merchants did not go, or in areas near the fields where illegal salt was rampant, to continue their poverty relief. The government transportation system was originally the most ideal method to

Prevent Smuggling

However, during the Song Dynasty, conscripting laborers and villagers for transportation caused them to lose their lives and fortunes, causing significant disturbances. And since the Republic of China, the government has not actually implemented official transportation. Most of it is still contracted out to merchants, which is the same as contracting. Those who set up bureaus to handle transportation hired relatives and friends, sharing profits and selling private salt, resulting in extremely corrupt operations. All of this is due to improper implementation. It should not be said that the official transportation system itself is bad, and we cannot abandon it because of this. After salt is transported by the government, the past malpractices of "stealing," "concealing," "pouring," "selling," and "using salt to transport salt" can be eliminated.

(4) Salt is transported from the production area to each sales outlet, or stored in warehouses at a suitable location with convenient transportation at the sales outlet. It is then sold wholesale by the government to licensed merchants, who resell it within a specified range. Consumers can buy from licensed merchants. With the government coordinating distribution and sales, it can both collect the profits of government sales and not deprive merchants of their profits. Consumers can buy freely, with no fear of salt shortages or high prices.

The above-mentioned government monopoly of government production, purchase, transportation, and sales should be regarded as an enterprise, correcting the malpractices of the past "government-run" system. Talented people who are good at running businesses should be selected to take charge. A state-owned salt industry company should be established to use business management techniques to plan the nationwide salt monopoly. From production and purchase to transportation and sales, all business operations should be the

Salt Industry Company

Responsible for handling. Salt affairs administrative organs should be in a position of supervision and guidance, without being responsible for operations themselves, which is completely different from the so-called "government-run" and "government transportation" in the past. The monopoly system has been extremely popular in recent times, but our country was the earliest to advocate it. The object of the monopoly was salt. During the Spring and Autumn period, Guan Zhong implemented a salt monopoly in Qi. The methods of monopoly varied slightly through the Han, Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, and since the early Republic of China, it has been changed to commercial monopoly. All salt purchases and movements are handled by merchants authorized by the government, who collect taxes in between, and the profits go to wealthy merchants. Salt has a wide range of uses and is essential for people. Although the government advocates free trade, in nearby areas or places with convenient transportation, people may still be able to operate freely. In sales outlets or remote areas, small merchants are often merged by large merchants. Only merchants with strong financial resources can operate. These merchants tend to manipulate the market and monopolize profits. Therefore, the operation of the salt industry inherently has a monopoly nature. It will either be a government monopoly or a commercial monopoly. According to our country's historical records, the facts are clearly verifiable. This so-called government monopoly system is that the state-owned salt industry company is responsible for all operations. Its organization and business are no different from a privately operated enterprise company, that is,

Achieving the purpose of government monopoly through private operation methods. However, the capital is allocated by the state treasury (but commercial shares can also be collected appropriately), and the income from the company's operations is entirely attributed to the state treasury (if commercial shares are collected, dividends are distributed according to shares). It is no different from taking the past

Merchant Monopoly

The rights are transferred to the state for its own operation, and its income is used to supplement the state treasury, taken from the people and still used for the people, which can be said to have the advantages of a commercial monopoly without the disadvantages of a government monopoly. Since salt is monopolized by the government, the government can naturally take care of the livelihood of salt farmers. The government can calculate the cost of production and give them legitimate profits as a standard for determining the purchase price. Since the purchase price is not too low, salt farmers' production will naturally be profitable. At ordinary times, the government can also provide loans to salt farmers, such as the advance of funds in the past by salt merchants, and fund the maintenance of the furnaces, and can guide salt farmers to set up various cooperatives to reduce the burden on salt farmers. The people will naturally be unwilling to leak private salt. At the same time, the government can also assess the purchasing power of consumers, and the price will not be too high. It only needs to view the salt's transportation from the place of production, calculate its cost, transportation costs, taxes, and the legitimate profits of the merchants to determine the selling price of the salt. This price, without the encroachment of past salt merchants, and the various fees paid to the coastal ports, has lower costs and therefore lower selling prices. Consumers have a lighter burden and are naturally unwilling to eat private salt. It can be said to have the advantages of government monopoly without the malpractices of commercial monopoly. I deeply believe that the current county administration reform, this system, etc., conforms to the principles of planned economy, which is relatively complete and easy to implement.

### Reader's Opinion: Writers After Victory

— Han Qiu

Victory is the ardent hope of the people of the entire country. With victory, the people should celebrate, and writers should write more articles about victory. Victory is the merit of the soldiers in the War of Resistance, and the common people should respect and love them, and writers should write more articles praising them. However, the psychological contrast of the Chinese people is difficult to fathom. Before victory, they longed for victory and had been looking forward to it for eight years. After victory, however, they became pessimistic, feeling that the future held little hope. Writers seem only to know how to criticize the world and are not accustomed to supporting the cause. They do not think about how the national army can be compared with the puppet army? The national army fought to the death in the War of Resistance, while the puppet army sought only to live in peace. At the same time, poor clothing does not mean that one cannot win battles. The country is poor, and the national army does not have camp equipment. If there are no barracks in the area, can they camp out in the open? To say that the national army rapes women is a fabrication. (Among the enemies, only bandits rape women.) During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the National Revolutionary Army did not have such things happen. With victory, how can they still smear their own faces? The person who wrote such an article simply has a nerve problem with his pen and is so sorry to the soldiers who fought in the War of Resistance for eight years! (Written on the night of February 1, 1946, at Jiawang Coal Mine on the Jinpu Railway.)

### Editorial: Congratulating Our Country's First Cardinal

Pope Pius XII of Rome announced at a secret meeting of the "Episcopal Conference" on the 18th that he would elevate 31 bishops to the rank of cardinal, including the Apostolic Vicar of Qingdao, China. The Pope also issued a decree, stating: "The appointment of new cardinal bishops has long been in my mind, but I was prevented from realizing it due to the war. Now that the war is finally over, we can implement the planned plan. The universality of the Church has now been increased with new glory. The Church does not belong to any one race, one people, or one country, but to the masses of the human family." According to a Reuters dispatch from Rome on the same day, "Behind the solid medieval walls of the Vatican, the Holy See is about to hold a series of meetings that are full of repentance to symbolize the renewed vitality of the Catholic Church in a world troubled by war. According to Vatican merchants, the collective gathering of cardinals in Rome this time, as in the human history of the past, is a turning point in history; and at every turning point in history, the Catholic Church must show its eternal creative vitality. The number of cardinals meeting at the Vatican this week is unprecedented; and the number of 32 cardinals appointed by the Pope this time is also unprecedented in the history of the Catholic Church." The dispatch also stated: "The presence of the first Chinese Cardinal in the Sacred College of Cardinals is enough to show that the Pope's ideas are not limited by narrow European traditions." In today's world, even though World War II has ended, there are still strong powers scheming to undermine world peace. The solemn meeting being held in the Vatican gives us a sense of coolness and warmth, allowing our troubled minds to find peace and tranquility. The radiance emitted from St. Peter's Basilica today, as in the long history of mankind in the past, illuminates the hearts of people all over the world.

This gathering at the Vatican has a very profound historical meaning. The extraordinary meeting has been convened after mankind has endured an unprecedented catastrophe, and the cardinals who participated in the meeting came from distant parts of the world. This not only shows the "holy and universal" universality of the Catholic Church but also is enough to show that the Catholic Church transcends the mortal world and is eternally new. It is not frustrated by the difficulties of the times but instead thrives in adversity, further increasing its dynamic and vibrant power. Today, although the fires of war have subsided, there are still broken walls and rubble everywhere. Mankind has just come through a brutal war, and it is not the world peace conference or the international conferences where politicians are scheming and fighting that makes them realize the wholeness of humanity, but the meeting being held behind the medieval walls of the Vatican. There is true peace there, and there is a representation of the wholeness of humanity and the unification of the world. The fact that the Catholic Church can express the spirit of the wholeness of humanity and the unification of the world at this time is enough to show the abundant power of the Catholic Church itself.

From the perspective of the Chinese people, in this historically significant meeting, our country's first cardinal, Bishop Tian Gengxin, participated. This is a creation in the history of the Catholic Church, which is particularly meaningful. Before the newspaper learned that our country had selected a cardinal bishop, it had written an article, believing that "the Pope's appointment of Bishop Tian Gengxin as cardinal shows how much the Pope cares about the church affairs in China," and said: "Now that the Pope cares extremely about the church affairs in China, and our government also maintains the missionary work of Christianity with utmost care, I sincerely hope that Catholicism can continue to develop in our country and that China can gradually become a family of Christians, living up to the expectations of the Pope and our Chairman." "Judging from the election of Bishop Tian Gengxin as a cardinal, it can be seen that the Catholic Church in China has gradually reached adulthood. We will not forget that during the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, the spread of Catholicism had a positive impact on our culture. I sincerely hope that Chinese Catholics... can make outstanding contributions in the work of building a new China and a new world." Cardinal Tian is modest, pure in character, and has mature wisdom and integrity; this promotion to cardinal is a personal honor, but the fact that China can participate in the confidential affairs of the central authorities of the Holy See because of Cardinal Tian's election is a credit to China. At the same time, the election of a Chinese person as a cardinal is enough to show the universality of the Holy Church and is also a credit to the Church. Our Chairman Chiang cares very much about the work of the Christian Church in China. This time, Mr. Tian was elected as a cardinal, and it was proposed to send a special plane to greet him and bring him to Chongqing, which shows how much our government, including the Chairman, expects of Cardinal Tian. Chinese Catholics should be inspired by the election of Cardinal Tian, who is unanimously admired as a leader in spirit, and should take on the responsibilities that they should assume in the cause of national construction.

Chairman Chiang came to Shanghai this time. In his address to the people at the mass welcome meeting in the racetrack, he asked us to learn the moral spirit of foreign countries. The newspaper wrote an article on the 12th anniversary of the New Life Movement, elaborating on this point, and said: "In the Chairman's speech at the racecourse, he taught us to learn their moral spirit... The moral spirit of the West, including the Soviet Union, is deeply rooted in Christianity. In addition to moral rules, they also have religious rules to regulate their behavior. The New Life Movement takes the restoration of inherent morality as its main task, and perhaps a new driving force is needed in its implementation. The inherent morality of our country and the moral rules of Christianity can be said to be one and the same; if we want to thoroughly learn the moral spirit of the West, we must also pay more attention to the Christian rules of Western civilization." What is the new driving force that may be needed to promote the New Life Movement? It is probably Christianity, especially Catholicism in Christianity. Catholicism has strict rules, a close-knit organization, and is spread throughout the country. Its missionaries are content with poverty and abandon the comfortable worldly life to go to poor and remote areas to serve the Lord until the end, which is the highest expression of the moral spirit of the West. If the New Life Movement is to achieve its effectiveness, it must be added with a religious baptism; with a religious enthusiasm, the personal life can be thoroughly reformed. The New Life Movement is to restore our country's inherent morality so that individuals can be responsible and disciplined in their lives. Our country's inherent morality is also the moral values cherished by Christians, and being responsible and disciplined is the consistent spirit of Catholics. The New Life Movement is the basic work of national construction, and in this basic work, we need the cooperation of Catholics.

Catholicism is not a religion that is detached from the world; if it were detached from the world, it would not be a religion. Catholicism has what is called the Triumphant Church, the Militant Church, and the Suffering Church. Catholics in the present world belong to the so-called Militant Church and must constantly fight against the enemy. Therefore, the Catholic view of life is a fighting view of life, which must be defended and fought at all times. This kind of battle is widespread in all aspects, so it also has immutable principles for the reconstruction of social order. The late Popes Leo XIII and Pius XI issued encyclicals on social and economic issues, providing the most detailed and concrete plans for the reconstruction of social order, establishing a complete system of Catholic social economy, characterized by moderation and peace, and starting from "charity" to seek the welfare of all people. This Catholic system is secretly in line with the spirit of the Three Principles of the People, the highest principle of national construction in our country, but the efforts of Chinese Catholics on how to implement Catholic social and economic policies in China still seem to be insufficient. At this time of national construction, Chinese Catholics should make more contributions in this area.

Shen Bao is a public instrument of the people of the whole country. Because Bishop Tian Gengxin has been appointed as a cardinal and is participating in the historically significant meeting being held in the Vatican, I would like to express a few words to congratulate him.

### Eradicating Illegal Speculation in the City Market: Merchants Decide on Four Measures: 2,000 Telephones Will Be Removed

Yesterday, there were few shadows in the securities building. Yesterday, there were few shadows in the securities building.

The financial authorities were extremely indignant that a group of incorrigible people gathered in the securities building to engage in speculative trading, creating a black market horror. Financial Commissioner Chen Hang especially invited the municipal government and security authorities to a meeting at the municipal government yesterday to discuss effective measures to thoroughly eliminate it. It is reported that it has been decided that (1) they will be ordered to suspend business, (2) the liquidation will be carried out by the Securities Exchange Council, and this kind of thing will not be allowed to happen again, (3) the telephones will be removed, and (4) the police will be dispatched at any time to patrol, and if any gathering of buying and selling is discovered, it will be prohibited. In the future, if any relocation of business is found, it should be dealt with accordingly. Other matters, such as the Central Market and money exchange shops and banks, if there are illegal actions, the social security aspects will jointly be responsible for strictly sanctioning them.

It is said that the so-called brokerage firm in the securities building has reached more than 100, and there are about 2,000 telephones, and the most one has reached a dozen, which is really shocking.

Yesterday afternoon, the reporter made a special trip to inspect the securities building on each floor. The scene was quiet, and the shadow was as desolate as on a holiday. The merchants and other partners gathered to gamble and do other things. The counters were densely arranged, and the telephones were silent. The blackboard was silent, black and white. This time, the ban on the black market has suffered losses and is still sporadic. They only have a small amount of capital, and the loan is borrowed and cannot be sold, so the impact is unaffected.

### Pseudo-Bank Guard Captain Dai Changling Arrested

Dai Changling, also known as Dai Yin, the captain of the pseudo-Central Reserve Bank guard battalion, was arrested by the preparatory department of the Japanese military police yesterday. After the investigation is completed, he will be escorted to the High Court.

### Japanese National Takagi Tadashi Strangles Ship Captain

[Report from this newspaper] Takagi Tadashi, a 28-year-old Japanese national residing at No. 40 Xin'anfang, Huimin Road, was formerly a trainee on the "Toa Maru" of the East Asia Shipping Company. On December 3rd of last year, he visited the ship captain Matsuzaki Tokio, who asked him to sell a watch and a belt on his behalf. Takagi lost these items, and Matsuzaki repeatedly pressed him for them, but without success. On the afternoon of December 19th at 3:00 PM, Takagi Tadashi brought a bottle of sorghum liquor to Matsuzaki's house, but Matsuzaki was out. So he bought back pork and vegetables and waited for Matsuzaki to return. When Matsuzaki returned, they drank together. During their conversation, the matter of the lost items was brought up. Takagi Tadashi suddenly strangled Matsuzaki with both hands and used a white cloth to strangle him to death. After the incident, Takagi took bedding, wicker baskets, leather shoes, and 1.8 million in counterfeit currency from Matsuzaki's house and hired a car to take them to his friend Harada's place. Then he returned to the scene, moved the body, and dumped it in the wasteland behind No. 19, Lane 416, Zhoujiazui Road. Later, the stolen items were discovered, and the police were notified to arrest him. He was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office and prosecuted under Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the case was heard in the First Criminal Court of the District Court. The defendant pleaded guilty without denial. The court announced that the verdict will be delivered at 3:00 PM on the 23rd.

### Large Quantity of Peanut Oil Transported from Qingdao by Boat

[Report from this newspaper] A shipment of peanut oil, totaling over 1,000 tons, is currently being transported from Qingdao to this city. Approximately 1,000 barrels of this oil belong to the Enemy and Puppet Industries Processing Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions.

### Social Bureau Employee Fang Xihe Prosecuted for Embezzlement and Dereliction of Duty

Investigation Reveals Tao Yuanlin Not Involved

Fang Xihe, section chief of the Accounting Office of the Municipal Social Bureau, is suspected of embezzlement and dereliction of duty. The bureau transferred the case to the court for investigation on January 2nd. Subsequently, Tao Yuanlin, the accounting director of the bureau, was implicated due to his kinship with Fang Xihe. Mayor Qian issued a hand order on January 8th to transfer the case to the court for joint investigation. The Procuratorate of the court opened the trial on January 11th. The plaintiff, Shen Datong, testified that accounting director Tao Yuanlin had no prior agreement or suspicion in this case. The prosecutor, after learning the truth, immediately granted bail. The investigation of the case has now concluded. Fang Xihe has been prosecuted, while Tao Yuanlin has been ruled not to be prosecuted.

### First British Oil Tanker Arrives in Shanghai After the War Carrying 5,000 Tons of Kerosene

The first British oil tanker after the war, the "Bella," has arrived in Shanghai, carrying 5,000 tons of kerosene and crude oil. The oil carried by the ship is intended to be sold exclusively to the Asiatic Petroleum Company, as the company's oil supply is currently needed to supply the provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei.

The "Bella" belongs to the British Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company and transported a large amount of oil to supply the Allied forces during the war.

First Soviet Ship Arrives in Shanghai

[Another Report] Soviet ships coming to Shanghai are usually handled by the Hongyun Shipping Bureau. The office is located on the second floor of the Dalai Building, 51 Guangdong Road. Since the Japanese launched their southward invasion, navigation on the Sino-Soviet line has also stopped. After the Japanese surrender, ships from various countries have successively sailed to Shanghai. The Soviet ship "SMolny" also sailed from Vladivostok and entered the Wusongkou at 2:10 PM yesterday, and berthed at the China Merchants Bureau Jinliyuan floating pontoon No. 34 at the Xinkaihe dock at 4:00 PM. The ship has a deadweight of approximately 8,000 tons and is the first Soviet ship to enter the Huangpu River after the victory. A reporter specifically inquired with the Hongyun Shipping Bureau, and according to Chen Guan, the shipping director of the bureau, the import procedures for the ship have not yet been completed, so the details of the cargo are unknown.

### Wage Issues of Newspaper Employees Awaiting Assessment by the Social Bureau

Shanghai newspaper employees previously submitted written suggestions to the management regarding the issue of raising wages, using the rise and fall of the cost of living index as the standard and calculating with 55 yuan as the base salary. Because negotiations between labor and management were unsuccessful, the labor side applied to the Social Bureau for mediation. The Social Bureau convened a mediation meeting between labor and management at 2:00 PM on the two previous days. Labor and management failed to reach an agreement, and the mediation was declared unsuccessful. The Social Bureau will make an impartial assessment and deliver it to both labor and management this afternoon. It remains to be seen whether both labor and management can abide by the results of the assessment.

### Continued Trial of the Case of Killing American Pilots; Fierce Debate Between Both Sides; Testimony of Kaburaki Highly Deceptive

[Report from this newspaper] The trial of the war criminal killing of the American pilots in Hankou continued yesterday morning on the 18th. The debate between the plaintiff and defendant was still quite intense. It is estimated that a verdict will be reached today, which is highly unlikely. According to Major Li Wen, the defense attorney for the defendant, the defendant's side has not finished its arguments, and the date of the verdict is still early.

At the beginning of the hearing yesterday morning, Lieutenant Colonel Harkins, the defense attorney for the defendant, protested against the plaintiff's attorney cross-examining the written statement made by the defendant, arguing that this violated basic legal principles. Lieutenant Colonel West, the plaintiff's attorney, retorted that the statement made by the defendant was clearly inconsistent with the facts and could not be used as evidence to exonerate him. As for saying that this violated basic legal principles, that was unheard of.

The court immediately adjourned for consultation and rejected the protest raised by the defendant's attorney as a result. Then, Major General Kaburaki Masataka, Chief of Staff of the 34th Army of Japan, was interrogated. Lieutenant Colonel West asked if he knew that the Japanese military police participated in the parade of the three American pilots, which was one of the tasks of the 34th Army. Had he received a report from Lieutenant Izumi, who carried out the parade, regarding this matter? Did he remember that American planes distributed leaflets stating that prisoners of war should not be abused? Did he receive a report from Izumi that the Swiss consul had sent a protest letter to Izumi, informing him that the parade violated international law? And asked Kaburaki about the killing of the three American pilots and other issues. Kaburaki's testimony was vague, answered questions that were not asked, and always insisted: "I did not issue any orders" or "I do not know." He tried his best to shift the blame to Lieutenant General Hattori, the commander of the 34th Army who had died, and Izumi, who had not been captured.

Finally, the jurors asked if Kaburaki was acting on behalf of Hattori when he was absent. He replied: "Yes." Lieutenant Colonel West asked: "Then the orders he issued can be executed by you on his behalf?" Kaburaki cunningly denied it and did not give a definite answer, only saying: "If I can directly contact Hattori regarding affairs, he is responsible for directing them. I cannot change his orders." Lieutenant Colonel Harkins stood up to defend him and asked: "Was the order to carry out the killing determined by Hattori before he left Hankou?" Kaburaki replied: "It was issued by him before he left. Within the scope of my official duties, I cannot change his orders." Near noon, the court announced an adjournment and will continue the trial this morning.

### Labor Strike in the Cotton Textile Industry; Mediation Still Unsuccessful

More than 50 factories in the Shanghai cotton textile industry, such as Shenxin No. 9 Factory and Yufeng, are requesting adjustments to wages. The industry unions in the third and fourth districts have summarized general opinions, including 11 articles such as a general wage increase four times a year and supplementary cost of living allowance, and have requested the party and government organs to mediate. After six mediations by the Social Bureau, there have been no results. Yesterday afternoon, another mediation was held at the Social Bureau, with more than 40 representatives from the labor side. According to the labor side, the focus of the dispute lies in the third article, the supplementary cost of living allowance, because the management insists on not following it, so mediation is unlikely to be optimistic. After the index issue is resolved, the other ten articles can proceed smoothly, but it is currently at a standstill.

### Employees of the Commercial Press Go on Strike

The wages of employees at the Commercial Press in this city are meager, with monthly salaries of only about 10,000 yuan, which is difficult to maintain a living in the midst of skyrocketing prices. The employees have made four requests to the management: (1) One month of annual leave at the end of 1945, paid in full at the December salary rate. (2) The anti-war consolation money. Employees in Shanghai received an average of only 7,000 to 8,000 yuan per person, while employees in the rear received an average of 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per person. They requested that the same amount of consolation money be issued and supplemented as soon as possible. (3) Monthly salaries should not be less than 50,000 yuan. (4) Before the request is resolved, each person should be temporarily borrowed 50,000 yuan per month. They also requested mediation from the Social Bureau. Recently, because the management has not yet replied with a definite solution, and prices have been fluctuating even more drastically recently, making it difficult for employees to live, they went on strike at 1:00 PM yesterday.

### A Child's Foot Found on the Wasteland on Daji Road

[Report from this newspaper] At about 3:00 PM yesterday, a worker, Li Shichong, found a child's right foot on the wasteland to the left of the Daji Road Public Sports Field in the South City. After someone reported it to the Penglai Branch Bureau, officers were dispatched to the scene to investigate. The result was that it was likely that it was a part of a child's body, together with a child's head which was discovered on the field.

### Expanded Commemoration of the 12th Anniversary of the New Life Movement Held at the New Life Club

Yesterday (the 19th) was the 12th anniversary of the New Life Movement. At 10:00 AM, the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association held an expanded commemoration at the New Life Club on Weihaiwei Road. More than 100 representatives from various agencies, organizations, and schools attended, including Qian Dajun, He Dequi, Wu Shaoshu, Wu Kaixian, Xuan Tiewu, Gu Yuxiu, Chen Shiquan, Zhao Zukang, Yu Songjun, and Wang Xiaolai. Mayor Qian served as the chairman. He first stated that the New Life Movement was closely related to national rejuvenation. The Chinese people must catch up with the new era, and first must get rid of all old habits and old ideas in life. The essence of the New Life is a revolution in life. Then, everyone stood up and listened respectfully to Chairman Chiang's "National Telegram on the 12th Anniversary of the New Life Movement". Subsequently, Chairman Wu, Deputy Mayor He, Director Gu, and others delivered speeches one after another. The meeting was adjourned at 11:30 AM.

### Shen Wanling, Manager of Shengsheng Ranch, Accused of Collaboration; Investigation Concluded, Trial Held Yesterday

[Report from this newspaper] Following the case of Li Ze being reported by Xin Xin employees, Shen Jiu cheng, the owner of the Shengsheng Ranch, and his son, manager Shen Wanling, were also reported by employees such as Sheng A'di. Shen Jiucheng fled after hearing the news, and only Shen Wanling was arrested. The case has been concluded by the Procuratorate, and yesterday morning, it was publicly tried by Judge Liu Yugui in the Criminal Court of the High Court at Tilanqiao.

Shen et al. Accused of Aiding the Enemy

The charges of Shen et al. Reported by the informants were: (1) Repeatedly hiring Japanese such as Toyoshima Umeyano, Noguchi Shoichi, Seki Kazutoshi, etc. as managers, relying on the enemy's power to oppress workers. (2) Shengsheng Ranch cooperated with the Japanese company Nanzhou Ranch, renamed Shanghai Nongye Company. (3) Constantly providing fresh milk and butter produced to aid the enemy. (4) When employee representatives Zhang Daode, Zhao Yiwen, Li Yougen, etc. requested improved treatment, Shen et al. colluded with the enemy army Unit 2322 to illegally detain and torture them, forcing them to resign with grievances.

(6) Deducting the employees' allocated supplies and occupying them for private use, etc.

Informants Testify in Court

Sheng A'di, Zhang Zhiyun, Li Yougen, accountant Zhang Xingquan, business department employee Yang Baiying, trainee Diao Deming, and Wang Jiajin, who used to serve in Shen's private residence, all appeared in court to detail the process.

Defendant Describes What Happened

When questioned, Shen Wanling stated: He hired Japanese to cover the company's assets. Because in the early days of the War of Resistance, Shengsheng Ranch donated more than 17,000 pounds of milk to the National Army, the enemy and puppets once kidnapped my father in 1940. I was studying at the time and was sent to Lushan for training. I secretly joined the Youth League in 1939. In 1940, I was reported in the pseudo-China Daily, and the enemy and puppets paid attention to this, so I had to use the Japanese as a cover. As for the matter of aiding the enemy with products, it was under the coercion of force. Shengsheng Ranch was taken over by the Enemy and Puppet Industries Processing Bureau in December of last year after employees reported it to the special commissioner of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, but it was returned on January 15th of this year, which can serve as my proof. The employees accused me because of labor disputes, and what they said is all slander.

Defense Lawyer Presents Evidence

The defense lawyer presented many documents such as account books. The informants also presented two photos of the documents when Shengsheng Ranch was operating with the enemy. Japanese manager Seki Kazutoshi was summoned but absent. The court ordered that if both parties have evidence, they can collect and present it again. The case was adjourned for further hearing, and the defendant was remanded in custody.

Li Hu Case Adjourned for Retrial

Yesterday morning, Judge Cai Jin also heard the case of Li Hu, the deputy officer of the Pseudo-China Central Fisheries Escort Team. After investigation, the case was ordered to be adjourned for retrial.

At a banquet for the Soviet ambassador at the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, General He drank too much and, due to years of accumulated fatigue, his nerves were damaged after being stimulated by excitement and alcohol, and he suddenly lost his sight.

Following the doctor's advice, he did not attend any social events or receive any guests. It is said that he will leave the country on the 25th of this month to seek medical treatment in the United States.

### Emergency Rumors at the Stock Exchange Building; Black Market Transactions Bleak; Gold and Dollar Market Prices Resemble Previous; Public Bonds Slightly Rise, Stocks Slightly Decline

Yesterday's report stated that the authorities would take severe measures against major speculators in the stock exchange, and that public security authorities would punish them. As a result, many brokers suspended operations. However, due to the urgent need for supply and demand, there were still private transfers. The market situation was calm, with none of the former glory. The overall trend resembled the previous day. Credit gradually eased. Despite external pressure, it managed to hold. The morning opened hovering around 1.4 million, but many were intimidated by the authorities' stern warnings, leading to a low price of around 1.35 million. Credit sources were slightly looser than before. Money changers and northerners bought in at lower prices, while Sichuan banks and those with goods to sell continued to absorb in hopes of squaring their positions, briefly returning to 1.43 million, and then hovering around 1.38 million. Compared to the previous closing, it showed a slight increase. The afternoon saw emergency rumors, lacking support. Brokerage remained without posted prices. Silver remained at 1,600, with silver dollars selling for 800 yuan, and black market interest at 2 to 2.5%, suggesting a potential loosening.

Foreign exchange, particularly U.S. dollars, remained sluggish, only hovering. However, the trend was not as weak as the previous day, slightly more relaxed. The morning started at 1,940 to 1,960 yuan, with a low of 1,940 to 1,960 yuan, a high of 2,000 and 2,020 yuan, and a final price of 1,960 to 1,980 yuan. It fluctuated slightly with the gold market, with the situation similar to the previous closing. Hong Kong dollar stocks were stable, resulting in old stocks being strong and new stocks being slightly weaker.

Public bonds rebounded after weakening, a result of pent-up sentiment. There was slight activity among brokers, leading to this. Type C initially opened at 1,400 yuan, reaching a low of 1,200 yuan. Idle funds from various industries were absorbed at low prices, and brokers also felt a loosening. It gradually recovered to 1,540 yuan, and idle funds from various industries were absorbed at low prices, and brokers also felt a loosening. It gradually recovered to 1,540 yuan, closing at 1,500 yuan. Miscellaneous brands once retreated to 800 yuan, and Type E to 900 yuan, but finally rose with Type C to outside the 1,000 yuan mark, resulting in a slight rise from the previous closing.

Chinese stocks were weak, only hovering. Wing On Cotton Mill was at the 2,000 yuan mark, Mayer & Feibel at 1,450 yuan, and King Fook Gold & Jewellery Co. struggled around 110 yuan. People were somewhat disappointed due to the indefinite resumption of operations, resulting in a slight decline.

Foreign stocks were also dragged down slightly. However, supply and demand gradually became more balanced. The continuation of the previous closing was seen, but not much, and trading was quiet. It was truly difficult to achieve widespread transactions.

### Yarn Prices Continue to Fall

Yesterday, the yarn market continued to trend sluggish, due to persistently tight credit. Fellow traders were eager to sell for funds, and customer firms were hesitant to buy, remaining in a wait-and-see mode. Manufacturers' willingness to purchase was also weak, causing prices to be unsustainable, falling another 40,000 to 50,000.

### Cotton Cloth Customers Remain in Wait-and-See Mode

Slight sales of cloth construction

Both holders of goods and customers remain in a wait-and-see attitude, believing that the authorities are determined to suppress cotton prices, and the market may not be sustainable. However, dyeing and weaving factories, because product costs have not decreased, adhere to the original prices, only hoping that customers will "move" early. The China Textile Company yesterday opened sales of 30-yard Taibai Zui Jiu yuan straight tribute for 54,000 yuan, 30-yard Jinlian Miao Wu yuan straight tribute for 48,000 yuan, yuan serge for 44,000 yuan, and 30-yard Shuiyue yuan feather satin for 75,000 yuan. It is said that hemp and wool textiles will be sold today.

### Cotton Transactions Scarce

Yesterday, there was no special progress in spot cotton transactions. Only the Textile Construction Company made slight purchases, acquiring 600 bales of American middling cotton and 100 bales of Tolles cotton, all raw materials for 32-count yarn. In addition, various yarn mills remained in a wait-and-see mode, with no transactions.

### Kerosene Can Blanks in Short Supply

112-pound and 156-pound tinplate, with sizes specifically for manufacturing kerosene cans, are named kerosene can blanks. For several months, the amount of American kerosene shipped has been few, so kerosene can blanks on the market have gradually become scarce. If it is not used soon, there will be a shortage. The current price for 112-pound is 100,000 yuan per box, and 140,000 to 150,000 yuan per box for 156-pound.

### Grain Prices Rise

Due to high production costs and scarce sources, rice markets are still active, and prices continue to rise by more than 1,000 yuan. However, the closing saw a slight softening. Flour also increased by 300 to 400 yuan. The oil market was firm in the morning and weak in the afternoon, showing a soft trend. Yellow soybeans were scarce, and the market was stable. Soybean cakes saw a small increase of 100 yuan, raw kernels remained similar, and wheat bran was strong.

### Sugar Prices Vary, Weak to Stable

It is said that over 10,000 pieces of mixed sugar have arrived, so medium-sized white sugar is weak, falling another 2,000 yuan to a price of 47,000 yuan. Other relatively scarce goods are more stable. A certain company once opened a batch, including 24 coarse white at 72,000 yuan, Dutch red at 72,000 yuan, Hong Kong ice flower green at 48,000 yuan, and Branch foreign at 56,000 yuan.

### Coal Market Returns to Firmness

The need for bituminous coal from factories has suddenly increased, while sources are limited. The supply of goods falls short of demand, and the market continues to advance. As for anthracite coal, the inventory of the same industry is also limited. Fortunately, actual sales are still weak, and there are not many transactions. Prices remain stable at a high peak. Due to the rising price of bituminous coal, some factories have switched to using chestnut firewood and miscellaneous firewood instead of tree firewood, causing the price of miscellaneous firewood to continue to be raised.

### Southwest Associated University Restoration Changes School Relocation Route

[Special Dispatch from Kunming, this newspaper, 18th] Southwest Associated University Relocation Committee Professors Zhang Yintang and Li Jitong went to the Yunnan-Vietnam border two weeks ago to inspect the school relocation route. The two returned to Kunming yesterday. According to them, from Mengzi to Hekou, ten camels are needed to transport the supplies.

The current semester of the United University is scheduled to end on May 4, so as to move in advance. After the relocation, the school will still recruit a part of freshmen in Kunming this year.

### Zhejiang's Recent Education Measures

Director Xu Shaodi Speaks Frankly

[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, this newspaper] Director Xu Shaodi of the Zhejiang Education Department made some explanations on recent education measures: (1) This year's education administration plan is being actively planned in order to implement it one by one. However, post-war education funds are still difficult and cannot meet the needs of education. Social order has not yet stabilized, which has not been without obstacles to education facilities.

Examination and Selection of Staff and Students

(2) The examination and selection of students from puppet schools has been divided into two types: grading and graduation. It has been designated to be held by public and private middle schools, and has been held separately in the middle of last month according to the schedule. Students enthusiastically participated, and the order of the examination was good. However, the results were very poor. This office is to show compassion for students in the occupied areas, so it will be handled leniently. Those who did not participate for some reason will also be remedied. The examination and selection of puppet teachers is scheduled from January 20 to the end of February. There are few people, and those who have not been examined and selected or those who have failed the examination and selection must not be hired. As for the puppet primary schools in various places, they are all taken over and rectified by the municipal and county governments, and the teachers are also examined and selected by the municipal and county governments. Primary school students do not need to be examined and selected.

Adding Vocational Schools

(3) In view of the geographical situation, environment and products of this province, the establishment of vocational schools should also meet this need to cultivate a large number of cadres and technical talents in the people's livelihood industry. In addition to the Hangzhou Higher Technical School, Higher Agricultural School, Jinhua Practical Agricultural School, and Dinghai Aquatic Vocational School, which were suspended due to the war, should be restored first. The school also plans to add cotton textile industry and applied chemical industry vocational schools as soon as possible.

Changing the Meal Allowance

(4) This year's treatment for secondary school teachers in the province, in addition to the adjustment of living expenses in accordance with the regulations, the hourly wage has increased slightly compared with last year. The treatment for specialist teachers in normal schools was originally the same as that for ordinary teachers. This year, the treatment for teachers in vocational schools will also be increased in the same way. As for the food expenses for public-funded students, relief students, and normal students in provincial schools, the subsidy fee for each person per month was 1,500 yuan and 2.3 dou of public grain last year. This year, because the public grain is cancelled, the meal allowance will be changed to 4,000 yuan per person per month. A semester is calculated as five months, and the province's public-funded relief normal school students, etc., are approved by the central government as 6,940.

Reorganizing Temporary Middle Schools

(5) After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the temporary middle schools were closed. The first and second temporary middle schools in western Zhejiang were changed to Jiaxing Middle School and Huzhou Middle School. The first, second and third temporary middle schools in eastern Zhejiang were changed to Quzhou Middle School, Chuzhou Middle School, Wenzhou Middle School, and Yanzhou Middle School to relieve students from losing their studies. All students are transferred to continue their studies in the branches. If students from each temporary middle school transfer to other schools due to family reasons, they should be handled according to the general transfer procedures. They should not be distributed. As for the public-funded students in each temporary middle school who transfer to other provincial schools in other provinces, because the number of places in each school has been determined early, the public funds cannot be transferred, and they must wait for the second semester when the school has vacancies for public-funded students before they can apply for replacements according to their grades. (6) The total number of education funds allocated by the central government for the whole year is 140,869,000 yuan. The cost should be followed by a budget totaling 605,562 million yuan, which will be compiled by the provincial government and submitted to the central government for approval. At present, only 60 million yuan has been allocated by the central government, which is a drop in the bucket. (Butterfly)

Spring and Autumn Special Issue of the Publishing Industry

### A Few Words in Print

— Editor

At a time when various construction projects are being actively carried out, the importance of cultural work is conceivable. Chairman Chiang once stated in "China's Destiny": "It must be known that the final effect of this world war will undoubtedly be attributed to culture, so this war can also be said to be a cultural war. The success, failure, rise and fall of nationalism, democracy and social justice in Europe and the United States for the past 350 years are all in this battle. The rise and fall of China's 5,000-year-old culture and its moral spirit are also the touchstone for this battle. If this war does not fail in the hands of aggressors, then human civilization will be scraped and polished, and Chinese culture will be carried forward. I hope my academic circles can truly understand that today is the greatest juncture for Chinese culture to carry on the past, open up the future, preserve existence and continue the extinction.

In the past, during the Anti-Japanese War, in the occupied areas of Chongqing, there was more destruction than construction. Some cultural workers could only guard their posts under extremely cautious and restrictive circumstances; the situation in the rear was difficult to develop rapidly due to the limitations of material conditions, and it was quite laborious to maintain the original situation. Because of the war, the cultural circles of the whole country were divided into several regions, and there was no communication with each other.

The scope of culture is very broad. In a more abstract sense, morality and customs can be said to be the culture of a country; in a more concrete sense, drama and singing are manifestations of cultural work. However, the most formal and effective thing is to talk about publishing.

The cultural level of a country can be distinguished from the quality and quantity of the books and newspapers they publish, because published publications can circulate in various places and promote cultural exchanges. The Westerners have a saying: "Transportation is culture." We can also say: "Culture is transportation." This sentence is very simple, that is, when our published publications are sold from one place to another, then our thoughts are also transported from one place to another. With the power of publishing publications, we can promote our inherent culture, so that Europeans and Americans, even if they do not come to China, can know everything about China. This kind of effect can only be harvested from cultural work, especially publishing. Therefore, the greatness of the power of publishing is self-evident.

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, cultural circles in various places hoped that cultures in various places could exchange with each other, but because transportation was not smooth, it could not be carried out as soon as possible. Cultural warriors who struggled hard during the Anti-Japanese War hoped to proceed step by step after the victory, but there are still many difficulties in front of them, such as the fact that transportation is still not smooth and the high cost of manufacturing figures. Therefore, the current publishing industry is really struggling in a difficult period.

Taking the publishing industry in Shanghai as an example, there are quite a few types of publications published after the victory, and the total number is not small, but the sales volume of each publication alone is not large, because the sales area is limited to Shanghai. At the same time, the cost is high, so the current business of the publishing industry is quite difficult.

Fortunately, those engaged in the publishing industry do not take profit as a prerequisite, or want to exert their own ambitions, or have the enthusiasm to serve the society, so even if the environment is difficult, they are still working hard.

What should be done most at present can be divided into two aspects. In the near term, colleagues in the publishing industry can unite to discuss and deal with and solve all difficulties, and refer to the situation of foreign publishing industries as a lesson for improvement; in the long term, they can encourage all sectors to increase their interest in reading, so that the sales of publishing publications can be expanded. The policy of this magazine can be carried out in these two aspects, hoping that all sectors will give assistance from time to time.

Book Review

### The Psychology of Configuration

— Wang Shilei

Original work by Kart Lewin, published by Zhengzhong Book Company, for university use.

Translated and narrated by Gao Juefu, first edition in Shanghai, November of the 34th year (of the Republic).

The author of this article, Mr. Wang Shilei, is one of China's leading psychology experts, currently a professor at National Lantian Teachers College in Lantian, Hunan, and has written extensively. —Editor

Decades ago, Mr. Gao Jueshu provided a very concise introduction to the research trends of the Gestalt psychology school and the special contributions of K. Felom (Lewin) in the preface of this translated book.

According to Lewin himself, the book "Principles of Configuration Psychology" is not intended to establish a new school of psychology. One of the main motivations of this book is to develop a psychological vocabulary that can be understood by all, without being limited to any particular school of psychology. This book offers some conceptual tools, which are derived from the extensive experimental research of Lewin's disciples over the past decade and have been verified in many experimental studies. Lewin is confident that regardless of the school of thought, these concepts are fundamental to many winter psychological research procedures.

Lewin also acknowledges that merely applying Gestalt geometry cannot solve psychological problems, just as applying Euclidean or Riemannian geometry cannot solve physical problems. However, in recent years, there has been a clear trend that any psychological theory must presuppose certain spatial concepts. For example, the formula "behavior is a function of the person and the environment" seems to have gained general acceptance among psychologists. This contains a theoretical field proposition (Atheoretical Field Proposition). Even research based on conditioned reflexes as a fundamental principle admits that all psychological behavior depends on "a group of simultaneously existing facts" (Hull). Isn't this the same as saying that it depends on a group of simultaneously existing facts as a spatial field? Furthermore, every school of psychology applies a construct as a basic concept of movement. This theory contains the properties of a vector: concepts such as excitatory tendency, drive, libido, or psychological force all presuppose the direction of the psychology and the space in which these directions are located.

From the above, we can see that the spatial problem of psychology must be solved by all schools of psychology. Lewin is confident that using the terms Gestalt geometry and hodological geometry to describe space in psychology, rather than Euclidean geometry, has clear mathematical significance. Lewin has made it very clear in his article (Formalization and Progress hiPsychology) what contributions this research method and concept have made to the description, explanation, and prediction of behavior. Whether we agree with Lewin's views or not, we cannot deny the hard work and pioneering efforts of him and his disciples.

In the past, the translator of this book has made great contributions to the introduction of important psychological literature. The translation of this book, in particular, is meticulous and painstaking. I was fortunate enough to have a sneak peek at a portion of the translated manuscript. It can be said that this famous book and famous translation possess both beauty and substance. I believe that those who study natural sciences and social sciences will gain many novel insights if they can study it.

### The Joy of Reading

— Xu Baiyi

If all the publishers in Shanghai were to convene a meeting to discuss the sales of publications, they would undoubtedly lament in unison that although Shanghai has a population of 5.5 million, the number of people who read is so small.

Logically, according to the proportion of the population, the sales of each publication should increase tenfold compared to the sales in other places. However, the reality is completely inconsistent with the theory.

Many people say that the reason why Shanghainese do not read is because Shanghai is a place with too many entertainment venues, thus all their space and time are spent on other entertainment. Ordinary men do not read, ordinary women do not read, working youth do not read, and even students rarely read books other than textbooks.

Of course, there are many exceptions, and the number of people who should be classified as exceptions is also considerable. Otherwise, the sales of publications would be even lower.

I believe that reading is the most enjoyable thing. Naturally, before experiencing the joy of reading, one will not say that reading is enjoyable. This is the same as other forms of entertainment. Before understanding a certain entertainment method, we may refuse to try it. However, other entertainment methods will have people to persuade and entice us. Only reading requires initiative.

In general, after people leave school, they break away from books. However, they therefore sacrifice many of life's pleasures, and they abandon the opportunity to absorb new knowledge. Purely from the pleasure of reading, if a person has a job during the day, in their spare time, they can put on casual clothes, choose a corner of the house, and flip through a few pages of books related to their profession, absorbing the latest knowledge, which can be immediately applied to their work. During the application, there will be a sense of supreme pleasure. If they browse a few pages of books for recreation, it can relax their tense nerves. This kind of leisure and leisurely pleasure can only be obtained through reading.

If one is a housewife, then after finishing household chores, she can open her favorite books without any restraints, and can obtain a kind of leisurely pleasure. Moreover, most household chores require physical labor, and reading can be used as a mental adjustment, which is most in line with the conditions for self-cultivation.

If one is a student, then he can choose various publications that introduce new knowledge to enrich himself and increase his wisdom.

The Chinese have always valued scholars because scholars can create a kind of refined style, as the saying goes, "A belly full of poetry and books makes one's aura naturally elegant." A person who is well-read and a person who is illiterate are very different in terms of speech and behavior.

Of course, the times are progressing, so the books that modern people read must be practical and adapted to the environment. Moreover, useful time cannot be spent reading meaningless books. Speaking of the economic aspect of time, because the acquisition of experience takes many years and several failures, but by reading books, one can acquire experience in the shortest period of time. Anyone who has not yet enjoyed the pleasure of reading can start immediately, experience the joy of reading. When deciding what to read first, simply ask yourself what knowledge or things you most want to know, and it will not be difficult to find the books that best suit your needs.

### Cultural Movement Outline and the Publishing Industry

— Su Wen

Recorded from Mr. Zhang Daofan's article "Prospects for the Cultural Movement"

"The essence of culture is upward progress and self-improvement, that is, what Hegel called 'a higher level of liberation'." This liberation includes the individual's pursuit of spiritual elevation and the nation's pursuit of spiritual freedom. Its process is a kind of movement. Since the Reform Movement of the late Qing Dynasty, there have been many routes and chaotic steps in the cultural movement in our country. At that time, foreign culture was neither well selected nor absorbed, and international political aggression shook our inherent excellent national virtues. In the hundred years of the late Qing Dynasty, "the nation and the people, in politics, economy, society, ethics, and psychology, all showed signs of decline and foreign aggression, with internal crises lurking, almost destroying the foundation of our regeneration and cutting off the source of our revival" (quoted from Chairman Chiang). If the founding father had not adapted to the trends of the world while inheriting historical traditions and advocated the cultural movement of the Three Principles of the People, Chinese culture would not have regained its upward path today.

The process of the cultural movement should include two stages: one is cultural struggle, and the other is cultural construction. The cultural movement of the Three Principles of the People has already completed its mission of struggle in the process of the National Revolution. The task in the future should be to advance on the path of active construction, with the ultimate goal of completing the five major constructions of psychology, ethics, society, politics, and economy.

The Cultural Movement Outline promulgated by the central government in the winter of the 32nd year (of the Republic) briefly put forward the principles of the five constructions: (Although the outline was published three years ago, it is still worth following at this time)

Psychological Construction: Establish a revolutionary outlook on life, reform the bad habits of the people who live for the moment and are cold and selfish, and be able to raise a positive spirit, establish self-confidence, and practice revolution.

Ethical Construction: Improve the behavior of the people, restore the inherent morality of the nation, and promote it, cultivate the noble and healthy personality of the people, so that our 450 million compatriots can sacrifice the small self, abandon self-interest for the benefit of the group, be loyal to the country, be filial to the nation, believe in righteousness, be benevolent to the people and cherish things, and promote peace and mutual assistance.

Social Construction: To enable the lives and actions of all members of society to follow certain rules, and to enable all basic undertakings related to the welfare of the people to be built up in an orderly manner.

Political Construction: Based on the spirit of encouraging the people to be autonomous and proactive, strengthen the ability to exercise power and promote the realization of national politics.

Economic Construction: I will do my best, the land will do its best, things will do their best, and goods will circulate smoothly to enrich national defense and improve people's livelihood.

### Zhengzhong, Striving Forward

— Wen Yao

During the Anti-Japanese War, Zhengzhong authorities bore the greatest responsibility for the publishing industry. This reporter visited the bureau to report on the dynamics of the publishing industry and wrote this introduction.

In the new China, among the publishing industry, the most youthful, the most energetic, and the most promising future, Zhengzhong is probably the most hopeful member.

The enemy's artillery fire not only wanted to destroy our lives, but also needed to destroy our culture. Zhengzhong, under severe losses, moved west with the government. At that time, most of China's publishing industry remained in Shanghai and Hong Kong, forming a separation. The problem of supplying books to the rear had to rely on it to support the overall situation.

The life in air-raid shelters and under tung oil lamps is not enough to express its hardships; the publication of more than 2,000 reference books in the midst of war cannot be said to be a great achievement; only the sacrifice of private interests and the relief of the panic of textbooks in the entire Great Rear Area, so that tens of millions of students would not be without books and abandon their studies, is worthy of praise.

The matter happened when the enemy was spying on the Southwest. At that time, the nationally designated textbooks had not yet been compiled and printed, and even the old approved editions from Shanghai and Hong Kong could not be transported internally. The panic over textbooks had reached its peak. Zhengzhong resolutely contributed all the copyrights of their compiled and written "Nation-Building" textbooks to the country, so that education institutions in various places could reprint them themselves and supply them locally, which barely overcame the difficulties. Even later, the nationally designated editions compiled by the Ministry of Education were partly revised based on Zhengzhong's "New China" editions.

Last winter, after Zhengzhong came to Shanghai to resume business, in addition to printing a large number of textbooks, it also pioneered a new type of book published every day. In the midst of difficult recovery of production, such achievements are indeed commendable. It is said that they will increase the production quantity recently, to two types published every day. This will probably be realized after the spring sales.

Zhengzhong does not have extraordinary funds or special advantages, but for several years, it has relied entirely on strong perseverance to work hard in its position and create indelible historical achievements. If it is said that it is a sincere star in the Chinese publishing industry, it is better to say that it is a brave soldier in the cultural revival camp.

I silently wish that Zhengzhong can continue its past glory, complete even greater tasks, and remain eternally young.

### Outlook for the American Publishing Industry

Mr. Windelrich, Editor-in-Chief of the American "Saturday Review of Literature," recently gave a speech stating:

People in the book publishing industry look forward to maintaining their wartime profitability after 1946, but they deeply feel that they need a plan for publishing and sales in the future. Publishers, spinners, and booksellers all believe that the surge in book sales after 1939 may only be a wartime boom, unless the problems caused by the surge in textbook sales are resolved and the sales of a large number of books and periodicals are stabilized with improved domestic and international technology.

The "Domestic Commerce" monthly published by the US Department of Commerce, No. 24, states that since 1943, the number of books published in the United States has more than doubled. The total value of books published in 1945 was about 150 million yuan. The number of books published has not actually doubled, only because book prices are also rising, but its increase cannot be said to be small. The printing industry has experienced unprecedented prosperity during the wartime shortage of materials and various restrictions. The sales of children's books hit a record high. Commercial activities related to more joy and books have greatly developed and expanded their business. Department stores, pharmacies, book and magazine publishers, distributors, and book clubs have all expanded their book sales business.

The recent trend of interest in reading can be seen from the act of purchasing. In the kingdom of practical introductory books, the books that veterans and their families are most interested in are books on residential construction, interior decoration, and cooking.

There is a large demand for new books for career entrants and textbooks (including the crystallization of wartime teaching methods), technology and professional books. The sales of children's books will continue to increase. Books will greatly help families solve the problems of readjusting from wartime life to peacetime life. The sales of religious books, especially the Bible, will also increase significantly.

Judging from the fact that readers' interests are so broad, people's reading ability still needs to be further explored. The Christmas issue of the "Chicago Sun-Times" published a large number of special articles on the new standards of authors, editors, and publishers, showing that people in the publishing industry have faced the problem of how to maintain the best-selling books and periodicals that came with the war and adapt to this demand. If they cannot solve these problems, they will inevitably face the danger of recession or over-prosperity. Mr. Qi Wen, Chairman of the World Publishing Company, summarized: "Everything is very favorable to us, the large reduction in illiteracy has gradually expanded our market. The awakening of people's interest in political and economic development continues to stimulate people's demand for books and periodicals... and newspapers and books are powerful tools for cultivating social atmosphere."

Some publishing attempts reflect this spirit. The great success of handbooks and the booming sales of reprint books have paved the way for other 25-cent reprint books. The first collection of popular books (a total of 20 books) was published in its third edition on January 2, including Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath," and the market was very good and popular for a while.

Other publishing experiences - like reprint books, have also left the experimental stage - including current news-type books compiled and printed by editors who know the needs of readers. "Outlook" magazine has published several kinds of books and periodicals in this category in the past two years. All of them are compiled by the staff of the magazine and published by various bookstores. Johnson's "Wilson" is one of these collective creations; Sterner's "One Nation" is another. "Outlook" is a painting magazine, so these books are mostly rich in illustrations and texts.

In addition to realizing the unprecedented booming sales of books, people in the book industry are mutually warning themselves to act cautiously. "Publishers Weekly" recently published a special article calling on the book industry to investigate the current situation of bookstores and other book markets, stabilize distribution work, and encourage emerging talents.
