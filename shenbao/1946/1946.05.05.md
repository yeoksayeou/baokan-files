### Marshall and Zhou Enlai Met and Talked Yesterday; Xu Yongchang Flew from Chongqing to the Capital; The Three-Man Group Meeting is Expected to Resume Next Week

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, went to the official residence of Special Envoy Marshall at 5 Haining Road at 10:00 AM on the 4th for his first visit after arriving in the capital. The talks lasted for about an hour. According to Zhou's remarks to reporters this morning, the CCP still strongly emphasizes the conflict in central Hubei. According to our reporter's investigation, the war in central Hubei is not as serious as reported because the National Army is only taking defensive measures and being forced to fight without taking the offensive. It is expected that the war in the area will cease within days.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] General Xu Yongchang, the government representative to the Military Three-Man Group, arrived in the capital by special plane from Chongqing at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. He told our reporter that the government intends to hold talks on reopening the Northeast negotiations after receiving a reply from the CCP. It is rumored that Chairman Chiang will meet with General Xu Yongchang on the evening of the 4th. According to well-informed sources, if the CCP can sincerely accept Special Envoy Marshall's advice, order the Communist forces in the Northeast to withdraw from Weichun, and release the government officials and Chinese and foreign reporters detained by the Communist forces in Changchun, the Three-Man Group meeting is expected to resume next week.

[United Press, Nanjing, 4th] Special Envoy Marshall met with Zhou Enlai on the 4th to continue discussing the Northeast ceasefire issue, lasting about an hour and a half. This was the first meeting between Marshall and Zhou in the capital. Government representative Xu Yongchang arrived in the capital from Chongqing today and will also attend the next meeting. There was no progress reported in today's talks. Zhou Enlai proposed sending a thirty-person group to central China to implement a ceasefire. The Northeast issue remains deadlocked because the government declared that the Communist forces must first hand over Changchun before an agreement can be reached. If both sides insist on their own views, it will endanger national peace.

### Zhou Enlai's Remarks

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 4th] General Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, received reporters today and made remarks, saying in brief: The negotiations on the ceasefire in the Nine Eastern Provinces were recently held in Chongqing, but ended in failure. The biggest reason for this was that the Kuomintang insisted that the government forces occupy Changchun before signing the ceasefire agreement, a condition that could not be accepted by the CCP. Negotiations will continue in the capital in the future. The main goal of my visit to Beijing this time is the situation in Hubei. Zhou confirmed that the Communist army has occupied the two major cities of Harbin and Qiqihar in northern East Nine Provinces, and the areas on both sides of the Suifenhe to Manchuria railway have established people's governments. However, Zhou could not point out the position of the troops along the railway line, because most of them are irregular troops. Zhou also confirmed that the issue of stationing US Marines in North China was raised in recent negotiations, but he refused to announce any details. Zhou also refused to comment on whether a reply had been received regarding the CCP's protest to the United States against the United States helping China transport troops to the East Nine Provinces. He only said: The situation has changed slightly, that is, the previous US military transport of Chinese troops was for the purpose of recovering sovereignty in the East Nine Provinces, and at this moment they are transporting troops engaged in civil war. Zhou continued: I am convinced that the US government and people have no intention of interfering in China's internal affairs. President Truman has already provided assurances on this point. The Chinese Communist Party supports American-style democracy and the government principles put forward by President Lincoln, that is, the principle of democracy and ownership by the people, which is more supportive than the Soviet system. If the Kuomintang suspects the relationship between the CCP and the Soviet Union, then they should also suspect the relationship between the CCP and the United States. The CCP demands democracy in the East Nine Provinces. The CCP has no intention of monopolizing the East Nine Provinces, nor does it agree that the East Nine Provinces should be ruled by one party. In the future, after the reorganization of the central government and the establishment of a coalition cabinet of all parties, the East Nine Provinces should be jointly managed by the Kuomintang, the Chinese Communist Party, and representatives of the local people. In terms of foreign relations, we do not agree that the East Nine Provinces should become a base against the Soviet Union, nor do we agree to discriminatory treatment against Americans. What we need is only international cooperation. The rumor that the CCP has answered and signed twelve treaties with the Soviet Union is not true. The CCP has never signed a treaty with any foreign country on behalf of China.

### Tang Dynasty Statues Collected by the Northwest Expedition Team and Stored in Hankou were Destroyed by the Enemy

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 4th] The hundreds of boxes of antiques collected in the Northwest by the former Northwest Scientific Expedition Team included twenty-seven boxes containing Tang Dynasty statues, which were shipped to Hankou before the war and stored in the Shanghai Bank warehouse. Later, when Wuhan fell, they were entrusted to the American side for storage in the British-owned Longmao Bank. When the Pacific War broke out, the enemy stole these antiques and moved them to the puppet Zhongjiang Bank. Now the Ministry of Education has sent personnel to Hankou to search for them, and it has been found that the antiques have been damaged beyond recognition. The Tang Dynasty statues were extremely valuable in the study of Buddhist culture, and now they have suffered such damage, which is a great loss to our culture.

### All Circles in Beiping Commemorate the May Fourth Movement; Various Schools Hold Commemorative Meetings Separately; Alumni Gather for Dinner at Sand Beach Red Building

In the morning, there was a joint commemorative meeting of all circles and schools in the Hall of Supreme Harmony. The students of the Beiping Provisional University, which is about to be transformed into Peking University and Tsinghua University, also held a commemorative meeting in the morning, with a ball game and a party in the afternoon. Peking University alumni also gathered for dinner at the Sand Beach Red Building, the birthplace of the May Fourth Movement, tonight. Fu Sinian specially rushed from Chongqing to participate. Many of them were those who personally participated in the movement that year. The excitement and joy of this place and these people can be imagined. The Beiping Branch of the Chinese Cultural Association originally planned to hold a commemorative evening at the auditorium of Fu Jen Catholic University tonight, but someone temporarily reported that "the elements were complicated," causing Fu Jen to refuse to lend it. The association specially published a detailed explanation in the newspaper today, expressing "regret" and suspending it. The reporter met Cao Rulin, a person involved in the May Fourth Movement, today. This over-seventy-year-old director-general spoke with emotion when talking about the past. He said that what the students opposed at that time was the Beiyang government, not individuals, and he was only taking the brunt as a foreign eunuch. He said that he was indeed a supporter of Sino-Japanese friendship, but he did not agree with aggression. He admitted that most of the 100 million yuan in foreign debt borrowed at that time was squandered by the Beiyang government and not used for construction. He said that he was honored to be able to witness China's victory.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 4th] All circles in Beiping City held a May Fourth Commemorative Conference in the Hall of Supreme Harmony at 10:30 this morning.

According to Shao Lizi, Chairman of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, the exact date of the opening of the National Assembly is still difficult to predict. It must wait until the domestic situation is stable and various issues are resolved reasonably before it can be convened.

According to general observations, it is believed that it may be gradually cleared within a week. It is also learned that Liu Yicheng, the county magistrate of Benxi, has arrived with the army.

(3) Staying in the military means being willing to be a career officer and serving in the division for another year before being sent to various military officer schools. (4) Returning to their hometowns means not being willing to return to school or re-employment. The central government has appropriate measures for the future of Youth Army students. There is also a Youth Middle School that will be ordered to be established soon, divided into high and junior high schools, with 30 classes planned, each with 50 students.

### Conflict at the Junction of Henan and Hubei Provinces: The Military Mediation Department Consults All Day; Task Force to Yongnian Scheduled to Depart Tomorrow

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 4th] The Military Mediation Department consulted all day yesterday on the issue of conflict between the Nationalist and Communist armies in the eastern border area of Henan and Hubei. The CCP demanded the immediate dispatch of two additional task forces to investigate and mediate, otherwise, it asserted, a full-scale conflict would inevitably erupt, rendering all the efforts of the Mediation Department futile. As a result of the consultations, it was agreed in principle to send a task force. Simultaneously, it is reported that the government side proposed sending additional task forces to Gaomi, Nantong, and eastern Rehe. The eastern Rehe issue stemmed from recent troop movements by the Communist army in that area toward the Northeast. This issue was also agreed upon in principle by all three parties for dispatch of a task force for investigation and mediation, but no concrete decisions were made. Following the plane crash of the task force sent to Yongnian, the government has dispatched Lieutenant Colonel Zhang Chaoshu as a replacement, and the U.S. side has replaced its representative with O'Rosson. They are scheduled to depart on the 6th. After the detention of CCP personnel in Shijiazhuang, leading to their collective return to Beiping in anger, the Military Mediation Department has cabled its U.S. representative in the task force to investigate the truth.

[Central News Agency, Beiping Dispatch, 4th] The Guangshan Task Force of the Executive Headquarters is scheduled to depart from Beiping for Guangshan on the 5th. The leader from the government side is Colonel Chen.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 4th] The representatives of the three parties of the Jinan Executive Task Force flew to Qingdao yesterday and then proceeded to Gaomi. It is reported that the mission, in addition to conducting on-the-ground investigations into the truth of the conflicts in the Jiaodong area and engaging in mediation, also plans to put forward discussions on the restoration of railway repairs on the various lines in Shandong Province that are currently suspended. Military sources also report that at 10 PM on May 1st, the Communist army in Zhangqiu launched a second surprise attack on Mingshui, which was repelled.

[Associated Press, Beiping Dispatch, 4th] The Propaganda Bureau Office in Beiping issued a public statement today, stating that within Shandong Province alone, there are more than 260,000 Communist troops actively engaged in protecting ports leading to the Northeast and blockading transportation lines to prevent Nationalist troops from advancing. It is reported that hundreds of Japanese technicians are currently serving the Communist Party. The large Communist presence in Shandong serves three main purposes: (1) to maintain control over the large areas already occupied, (2) to protect ports for transporting troops to the Northeast, and (3) to disrupt the Jiaoji Railway, preventing Nationalist troops from gaining communication.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou Dispatch, 4th] The entire First Battalion of Yang Guofu's Communist army in Shouguang County, Shandong Province, recognizing that the actions of the Communist army were mostly detrimental to the country and the people, and that they were now being transferred to the Northeast to incite civil war, merely serving as expendable pawns, resolutely defected to the Nationalist army on the 10th of last month, bringing all their weapons with them.

Editorial

### The National Government Returns to the Capital

This morning, the National Government will hold a grand ceremony for its return to the capital. Central authorities and representatives from all sectors of the Nanjing municipality will gather solemnly before the mausoleum of the Father of the Nation to celebrate the victorious return of the National Government. We are filled with immense joy at this grand occasion. However, recalling the atrocities committed by the Japanese invaders when they entered the capital in December of the 26th year of the Republic, recalling the suffering of the people during the eight years of bloody war, whether they were displaced with the army, wandering and destitute, or subjected to enemy rule, groaning in misery, today, nine months after the victory, the government has announced its return to the capital, truly a case of "thinking about the pain after it subsides." Amidst our joyful excitement, we have countless thoughts.

First, we are delighted that Chairman Chiang's spirit and health remain as strong as ever. Chairman Chiang led the nation's military and people through eight years of struggle, and has already won victory. We are even more confident that Chairman Chiang will lead the nation to continue the struggle and win lasting peace – peace for the nation and peace for the world. "Peace, struggle, save China," these were the last words of the Father of the Nation, and we will never forget them. Today, Chairman Chiang leads civil and military officials in offering sacrifices at the mausoleum, and will surely fulfill his last will and testament, comforting the spirit of the Father of the Nation. "Peace, unification, democracy, unity," are the common aspirations of the entire nation, and we must, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, proceed with sincerity towards this clear goal. During the War of Resistance, Chairman Chiang was responsible for countless matters. Military, diplomatic, political, and economic affairs were all concentrated in one person, resolving major doubts and deciding major policies. Ultimately, he led the country through storms and waves to the shore of victory. His graying hair is proof of his diligence and concern. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang, at the age of sixty, remains vigorous in spirit, surpassing even the young. Before returning to the capital, Chairman Chiang first flew to Beiping, Nanjing, and Shanghai to comfort the people in the occupied areas. Recently, he flew to Guizhou, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei for inspections, and especially expressed deep regret at parting with Sichuan, which had served as the wartime capital. He traveled tirelessly, barely having time to rest. Chairman Chiang's spirit is a sign of the bright future of the nation. We respect Chairman Chiang, and whether officials or ordinary people, we must all serve the country according to our abilities, fulfilling our responsibilities, and not burdening Chairman Chiang with trivial matters. We must allow Chairman Chiang more time and energy to preside over the major plans of the nation; this is how we can show our love for Chairman Chiang and our care for the nation.

Second, we urge all parties concerned with national affairs to jointly fulfill their promises. The return of the National Government to the capital should be the beginning of peaceful national reconstruction. However, the peace and nation-building program of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), the military reorganization and unification plan, the ceasefire order, and the agreed-upon matters, this entire set of resolutions related to peace, has not seen genuine implementation in the past three or four months. The four promises announced by Chairman Chiang on the opening day of the PCC have already been realized one by one, but the other promises that should be mutually upheld by all parties have been delayed and evaded. Contemporary commentators on the CCP's approach to the current situation say that they aim to achieve "everything as a process, with no conclusion." Perhaps the Communist Party's brilliance lies in this "no conclusion" aspect. The reduction of the military should be a conclusion, but regarding how to unify the reorganized forces, and how to compile a list of names before unification, they have presented many processes, and the unification has been put on hold. The ceasefire should be a conclusion, but regarding how to mediate, and how task forces should implement the agreements, one party is mediating, while the other is provoking, leading to the ceasefire ultimately lingering in the process. Reorganizing the National Government and convening the National Assembly to draft a constitution should be a conclusion, but disputes over the number of seats and the failure to provide lists of representatives have stalled the reorganization of the National Government and delayed the convening of the National Assembly, leaving these two major events in a state of process. As for the Northeast problem, it was originally not a problem. With the withdrawal of Soviet troops and the central government taking over, it was perfectly legitimate and there should have been no disagreement. However, suddenly there was a so-called "Democratic Allied Army," and suddenly there was the siege of Changchun, so taking over the Northeast also became a twisted process. Such acts of bad faith are extremely frustrating. We believe that if all parties concerned with national affairs truly want the country to embark on the path of peace, unification, democracy, and unity, they must all show conscience and jointly fulfill all promises. The people will not tolerate any party playing the "process" game again, always avoiding the practical implementation of a "conclusion."

Third, we hope that the government will have the courage to reflect on itself and start anew with the people. Looking back at the Japanese invasion, the main reason was our own self-disrespect. More than twenty years after the founding of the Republic, we wasted time and achieved nothing. "Carelessly hiding, teaching theft," led to the Japanese wolfish ambition to nibble and devour. Now, with great difficulty, thanks to the bloodshed and sweat of the military and people of the whole country, and the joint assistance of allied nations, we have achieved final victory. We must not forget the pain before it has subsided, and everyone must quickly enjoy the blessings. Especially the government authorities, who need to lead the entire people to thoroughly correct past mistakes. "Comfort and ease are poisonous," as the ancient saying goes. Moreover, with the global food shortage, national famine, people struggling to survive, a powerful neighbor approaching, unsecured borders, and fifth columns active everywhere, the internal and external troubles facing our country are no less severe than before the War of Resistance. How can we afford to be complacent? The National Government, returning to the capital at this moment, should announce to all officials and start anew with the people. Save all wasteful expenses, cut all redundant personnel, abolish outdated laws like fur, abolish harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies that harm the people's livelihood, rectify official conduct, and enforce discipline, truly achieving "what the people like, like; what the people hate, hate." The Chinese people are the most docile and easiest to govern in the world. As long as the government does less to disturb the people, and officials come up with fewer ideas to disturb the people, the people will already benefit greatly, praising "virtuous governance" and spreading good words everywhere. We sincerely support the government, and we sincerely love our leader. We are not afraid of foreign aggression, nor are we afraid of internal rebellion. What we are most concerned about, however, is the rampant corruption of officials and the prevalence of slackness in the government! We believe that the key to governance today is to eradicate corruption. The way to eradicate corruption is to face reality and first repent of the past mistake of neglecting the treatment of officers and soldiers and public education personnel, and correct it from the beginning. The government not only needs to repent for this, but also needs to have the courage to change its ways, take responsibility, and find ways to improve their treatment. The government should be determined, make bold moves, and rather postpone all "new policies" and first concentrate its efforts on stabilizing prices; rather save other government expenses and first and foremost try to increase the salaries and benefits of soldiers, officers, and public education personnel. Just think: if we truly want to build a modern nation, how can we have any hope if officers and soldiers are not fed, public servants are not fed, and school teachers are not fed! The government's responsibility is to plan for the whole people to have enough to eat and wear. The food problem of soldiers, officers, and public education personnel is the first problem that the government should be responsible for. Otherwise, how can we eliminate corruption and work seriously? We believe that the National Government after returning to the capital must be a government that faces reality and starts anew with the people.

### Foreign Ministers' Conference Deadlock Difficult to Break: Differences Deepen Among the Four Powers; Discussion of the Southern Italian Border Issue Again Yields No Result Yesterday; Peace Conference Likely to Be Delayed Indefinitely

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, May 5th Radio: The four foreign ministers held another meeting today to discuss the border issue between Yugoslavia and Italy. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov expressed opposition to the border between southern Italy and Yugoslavia suggested by the British and American foreign ministers. It is said that the British and American suggestions are tantamount to punishing Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia was an ally of the United Nations during the war, and it is unfair to punish it now. The foreign ministers discussed for a long time, but still no results were achieved.

[United Press, Paris, 4th] The foreign ministers' conference has so far failed to reach a consensus on major issues. Today's meeting discussed the abolition of border fortifications in Italy and other relatively simple issues related to treaties signed by Italy with various countries before the war. It is said that whether the fortifications bordering Italy with France and Yugoslavia will be abolished will be decided by the foreign ministers' conference. Treaties previously concluded by Italy with other countries will also be submitted for discussion to see if any of them can be retained. Today's meeting was filled with pessimism, partly because there is no hope of resolving the border issue between Italy and Yugoslavia. In addition, the handling of Italian territories and the issue of reparations are also difficult to resolve.

[United Press, Paris, 3rd] The four foreign ministers' conference continued to meet at the Luxembourg Palace today. Regarding the border issue between Italy and Yugoslavia, the representatives of the two countries clashed in their opinions. Italian Prime Minister Gasperi claimed to speak on behalf of a new, peace-loving Italy and asked the foreign ministers' conference to define the border between Italy and Yugoslavia based on the old "Wilson Line," with the port of Trieste belonging to Italy. Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kartelj accompanied by Foreign Minister Simic and seven advisors attended the meeting and spoke for three and a half hours, insisting that Trieste and most of the Istrian Peninsula should be assigned to Yugoslavia. It is rumored that Kartelj almost demanded that the entire Istrian Peninsula on the Adriatic Sea and Trieste should all belong to Yugoslavia. At the same time, Italy insisted that the port and part of its hinterland should still belong to Italy. The foreign ministers' conference will hold an informal meeting tomorrow to discuss this issue.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 3rd, United Press] According to official sources, the four foreign ministers may pack up and return home without reaching any major agreements in public discussions. After a week of fruitless consultations, the differences between the Soviet Union and Western European countries have only intensified. If no agreement is reached on the draft peace treaty, the peace conference originally scheduled to be held on May 1st will be delayed indefinitely.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 3rd, United Press] TASS Paris reported that Bernas's suggestion to end the occupation of Germany is actually giving the Soviet Union another pile of waste paper, just as the current British government is also turning the Anglo-Soviet alliance into waste paper.

, unexpectedly, at approximately 1:00 AM on May 1st, soldiers, incited by Liu, rose up and demanded three months of back pay from Team Leader Su. When Su was responding tactfully, he was suddenly shot and killed on the spot by a soldier. Liu Jiyuan then led the soldiers to loot houses, lasting for three hours. The entire team of more than one hundred soldiers fled east by sea with Liu. It was discovered that 700 zuzu of rice and countless properties were lost. At 7:00 AM on the same morning, Zhaopu District Chief Qi Zhihong personally reported to the county government. Subsequently, a meeting was held with the Provisional Senate and the county party headquarters to send personnel to Zhaopu to comfort the people and investigate the truth. According to a reporter familiar with the inside story, the cause of the disaster was indeed the failure to pay three months of back pay. The government suddenly changed personnel without preparation, leading to this major disaster.

### Rumors of Iranian Prime Minister and Representative of Azerbaijan Holding Lengthy Talks and Reaching Agreement; Further Rumors of Azerbaijan Concluding Friendship Treaty with Kurdish People; Soviet Troops in Iran Have Completely Withdrawn Except for Azerbaijan

[Reuters, Tehran, 4th] The Greater Tabriz Radio announced that the "Democratic Government" of Azerbaijan has signed a friendship treaty with the Kurdish National Government. The preamble states that for twenty years, the two countries have suffered oppression from the central government under the dictatorial rule of Reza Shah and were unable to escape their shackles. The Second World War ultimately allowed the two countries to gain freedom, and the signing of this treaty is to protect these freedoms.

[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] The U.S. State Department and the Iranian Embassy have both received official reports confirming that Soviet troops have completely withdrawn from Iran, except for the northern province of Azerbaijan, and will withdraw from Azerbaijan by Monday. News from Iran has led the State Department and Iranian Ambassador Arale to believe that the Soviet Union will fulfill its promise to withdraw from Iran by May 6th, so the Security Council may end the Iranian issue next week. Various sources reveal that Soviet troops withdrew from Greater Tabriz this week.

### Cosmic Ray Bomb: 100 Million Times More Powerful Than Atomic Bomb

[Associated Press, Paris, 3rd] Professor Clay of the University of Amsterdam, Netherlands, predicted today that a cosmic ray bomb "100 million times more powerful than an atomic bomb" may eventually be successfully constructed. Speaking to a group of French scientists at the Elisee Square Building here, Clay said, "Once we discover the origin of cosmic rays, there is no reason why we cannot arbitrarily stimulate them."

### Soviet Union and Finland Sign Goods Exchange Agreement

[Another Dispatch] The State Department announced today that in order to fulfill the promise of the 1943 British-Scots Declaration to guide the Austrian people towards economic security, the State Department has entered into a $10 million credit loan agreement with the Austrian government.

### After the Publication of the Palestine Report, Arab National Sentiment Is Enraged; Al Arabim Warns Britain and the U.S. to Handle Matters in the Holy Land with Caution; General Strike in the Holy Land Fortunately Shows No Incidents

[Reuters, Cairo, 4th] Al Arab League Secretary-General Al Arabim issued a warning statement yesterday, saying that after the publication of the report by the British and American investigation team, many Arab people have suggested launching a holy war in Palestine and evacuating Arab women and children within the territory. This suggestion has serious consequences, as can be seen from the discussion. It is hoped that Britain will reject the suggestions in the report, especially the points about Jewish immigration and allowing Jews to buy land. The United States, being in a distant land, is naturally easy to make suggestions, but before making suggestions, it should first weigh the seriousness of the consequences.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 4th] Yesterday's general strike by the Arab people, except near the Damascus Memorial Gate, where the military police dispersed a large number of demonstrating people, had no other incidents.

Will Submit to Security Council If Necessary

[United Press, Jerusalem, 4th] The Chairman of the Arab High Commission met with British Commissioner Cunningham yesterday.

An editorial published in Jinnah's mouthpiece "Dawn" said that if this report is adopted, many people will be sadly missing for the defeat of Hitler.

### Soviet Bond Issue: 20 Billion Rubles to Revive the Economy

[United Press London, 3rd] Moscow Radio broadcast today: The Soviet government is issuing public bonds to its citizens worth 20 billion rubles, equivalent to $3.774 billion, to revive and develop the economy. Subscriptions are pouring in from all over the country. Although the government is only requesting workers to subscribe for one month's salary, many workers are willing to contribute six weeks to three months' salary. Individual subscriptions are as high as 25,000 rubles per person. The bonds will be repaid over 20 years, with prize money awarded by lottery according to bond number. According to Finance Minister Zverev in the broadcast, the bonds will be used for the first Five-Year Plan after the war and to strengthen military-economic power. Only Soviet citizens may purchase the bonds, which are exempt from property and income taxes. The winning numbers can receive a maximum prize of 50,000 rubles per 100-ruble bond, which is also tax-free. The Soviet Union will need 250 billion rubles in the next few years to engage in construction, strengthen defense, and maintain national security. This bond issue is equivalent to 8% of the total amount needed.

### Panda Arrives in Chengdu, to Be Flown to England by Special Plane

### MacArthur Orders Dismissal of Hatoyama: Cabinet Formation in Japan Thwarted; Efforts of All Parties Come to Naught, Political Situation Returns to Square One

[Our Tokyo Correspondent, 4th] Yesterday, the Shidehara Cabinet sent Foreign Minister Yoshida to visit MacArthur to request approval for Jiyuto President Ichiro Hatoyama to serve as the new Prime Minister. According to the purge directive of February 4, MacArthur's headquarters today ordered the Japanese government to dismiss Hatoyama and strip him of all public office. The reasons for Hatoyama being subject to the purge order are listed as follows:

(1) Served as Chief Secretary of the Tanaka Cabinet from 1927 to 1929, and formulated the Public Security Preservation Law. (2) Served as Minister of Education in the Inukai Cabinet from 1931 to 1934, suppressing freedom of speech, thought, and assembly. (3) Forced the dissolution of agricultural and labor organizations. (4) Consistently supported totalitarianism and aggression.

[Gaizo Nippo Tokyo, 4th] After MacArthur's headquarters announced the dismissal of Jiyuto's Hatoyama today, the question of who will succeed as Prime Minister has become a problem again. The stripping of Hatoyama of all public office is a bolt from the blue for the Jiyuto, suffering a fatal blow. Although the party is cooperating with the Progressive Party, because the Socialist Party has stated in advance that it opposes the Progressive Party, the result is that a cabinet centered on the Socialist Party may be formed, or a non-partisan figure may be elected as Prime Minister by drawing together all parties. There is no other way to go. Thus, on the thirteenth day after the collapse of the Shidehara Cabinet, the Japanese government has fallen back into a state of chaos. The efforts of the parties over the past two weeks have come to naught, and they must start again.

### Yoshida Likely to Be New Prime Minister

[Our Report] San Francisco broadcast, 5th: After MacArthur rejected Hatoyama as Prime Minister, Yoshida is the most likely candidate.

### Hoover Arrives in Seoul from Shanghai Yesterday for Inspection; To Fly to Tokyo Today; American Troops Will Line Up to Welcome and Be Inspected by Him

### American Escaped Convicts Fight Military and Police for Ten Hours from a Strategic High Ground

[Reuters San Francisco, 4th] The riot at Alcatraz Prison has not yet been quelled. US Marines, together with police and prison guards, are engaged in fierce fighting with a hundred of America's toughest convicts. It is reported that two prison guards have died and five have been seriously injured. There may also be deaths among the guards being held hostage by the prisoners. According to unconfirmed reports, one prisoner initially seized a guard's firearm and infiltrated the armory, frightening the guards there into not resisting, and seized weapons, and opened the main switch, releasing a large number of prisoners. The prison was in a state of terror all night. The location of the riot is the main prison building, which is located on a hilltop, so the prisoners have the advantage of shooting from a high position. They have a lot of weapons and ammunition, so the situation is still quite critical. As of the time of the report, the fighting has continued for ten hours. The authorities have ordered the use of tear gas, and two destroyers and several patrol boats have also sailed to the island to prevent prisoners from escaping across the one-and-a-half-mile channel to the mainland. Many residents of the San Francisco coast are watching, and black smoke can be seen rising from the prison through telescopes on the shore. However, prison officials called to say that the prisoners did not set the fire.

### Hurley to Participate in Senate Race

### US Chief of Naval Operations Nimitz Opposes Merger of Army and Navy

[Agence France-Presse Washington, 3rd] US Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Nimitz recently expressed his opinion to the Senate Naval Committee, firmly opposing the merger of the Army and Navy into one department. He said: Unified command is essential in operations, but it is absolutely unnecessary when drafting military strategies. If there is only one Ministry of Defense in the Cabinet during peacetime, the President's responsibility will be increased. In short, the merger proposal will reduce the combat effectiveness of the US Marine Corps.

### International Tribunal Continues Trial of Japanese War Criminals; Okawa Again Shouts Loudly in Court and Is Escorted Out for Examination; Indictment Read, Trial to Resume Tomorrow

[Our Tokyo Correspondent, 4th] The trial of Tojo and other war criminals continued today. When the indictment was read, Okawa Shumei shouted loudly again in the courtroom, but no one knew what he was shouting. Then Okawa's defense lawyer, Ohara, stood up and asked the presiding judge to allow Okawa to withdraw, on the grounds that Okawa had already suffered a nervous breakdown. The court granted his request.

During the recess, a reporter spoke with Ohara, who said: In 1939, Okawa worked hard in Shanghai to end the war in China and had disputes with Japanese warlords, and was imprisoned.

Today, the court clerk read the unfinished part of the indictment from yesterday, from Article 48 to Article 55. The full text was read.

After the chief defense lawyer reported that the process was finished, the court ordered all defendants to be returned to custody, and the trial will resume at 9:30 AM on Monday.

Okawa Wants to Kill Tojo

[United Press Tokyo, 4th] Japanese war criminal Okawa Shumei slapped Tojo's bald head twice yesterday in the Far East International Tribunal. At the opening of the trial today, presiding judge Webb ordered him to be expelled from the court. A few minutes after leaving the court, Okawa told a United Press reporter in still fluent English: "I will kill Tojo." Okawa's complexion was pale, but he said, "I am in good health because I benefit from air therapy. Please give me a cigarette." Okawa once advocated the Mukden Incident as a civilian intellectual, but the reasons he stated for wanting to kill Tojo were incoherent, only saying: "This move will benefit the country." In his rambling explanation, he mentioned past deceptions.

Referred to Doctors for Examination

Okawa again made the strange move of slapping Tojo's head yesterday and showed his hideous face to the photographers. Today's target was Captain Stickel, an officer of the General Headquarters News Office, who was hit hard by this thin prisoner. The photographers immediately turned on their flashes and took pictures of him. Presiding Judge Webb, seeing this, announced the appointment of two neuropsychiatrists to examine him to determine whether the criminal was mentally capable of defending himself. If the two doctors' diagnoses are inconsistent, the court will appoint a third person to participate in the examination.

Irrelevant Nonsense

After Okawa was taken to a room behind the courtroom, he lay on the bed. The photographers took pictures of him. At first, he did not move at all, then suddenly sat up and said in English: "I am very good!" He then explained his theory of air therapy and said: "I am preparing a deadly air weapon." When asked whether he was guilty or innocent, Okawa replied: "I and the happy merchant are good friends!" When asked again, he said: "I and him will do business together," but did not specify what kind of business.

It is clear that the pawn management rules are not perfect, resulting in this situation.

Self-Defense Force Mutiny Kills Officer. Liu Jiyuan, the captain of the first company of the county self-defense force, was stationed in Zhapu. Because of his misconduct and lack of military discipline, the county government ordered his dismissal and appointed Su Yingnan to take over. The handover was on April 29. Unexpectedly, at about 10:00 AM on May 1, the soldiers, incited by Liu, demanded that Captain Su issue three months of back pay. When Su was answering politely, he was suddenly shot and killed by the soldiers on the spot. Liu Jiyuan then led the soldiers to rob door-to-door for three hours. More than 100 soldiers in the entire team fled east by sea boat with Liu. It was found that the loss was more than 700 dan of rice and unvalued property. At 7:00 AM that morning, Qi Zhihong, the district chief of Zhapu, personally reported to the county government. Later, he consulted with the Provisional Council and the county party headquarters and other officials, and sent personnel to Zhapu to express condolences and investigate the truth. According to those familiar with the inside story, the cause of the disaster was indeed the failure to issue three months of back pay, and the government changed people suddenly without any preparation, which led to this disaster.

### City Police Bureau to Implement "Police District System" for Police Officers; To Make Regular Visits to Households in the Jurisdiction

[Our Report] In order to improve the knowledge level of police officers and to go deep into the people so that the police and the people can become one, the City Police Bureau will implement the "Police District System" from June 1. That is, each police officer will be in charge of 80 to 120 households or 400 to 600 people in the branch bureau district. Each police officer will be able to go to the households under his jurisdiction from time to time for regular visits, in order to understand the details of each household, so that criminals and bandits have nowhere to hide. This new type of control is very helpful to the city's police prevention, so the bureau is very careful in the selection of these police officers. In addition to the 376 police officers recently transferred from the Central Police Officer Training Corps, the bureau selected 75 junior high school graduates from the original 780-odd veteran police officers, who were approved to be police officers after passing the examination and screening, and concentrated on training together with the police officers who were out of tune in the middle of the month from the 1st to the 10th of this month. After the 11th, they will be assigned to each bureau for internship for 20 days. After being considered qualified, they will be assigned to a designated jurisdiction to start formal service. If there is no fault, they will not be transferred for at least six months to ensure proficiency. It is also heard that the bureau believes that the city area is vast and the citizens are of mixed quality, and the existing 400-odd police officers are not enough to be assigned. In order to facilitate the implementation, 150 male police officers and 50 female police officers will be recruited immediately.

### Yesterday's High Court Held Multiple Trials of Traitors; Judge Severely Reprimands False Officials Who Turn Red with Shame; Hu Zewu Mistakenly Believed in the "Peace Movement"; Wang Defan's Case Scheduled for Sentencing on the 11th of This Month

[Our Own Report] The false Legislative Yuan Secretary-General Hu Zewu was interrogated yesterday morning at 10 AM by Judge Qiu Huan-ying at the High Court's Provisional Criminal Tribunal. Hu admitted without hesitation to his positions in the puppet regime, claiming that everything he did was administrative work, all of which was helping out, and only regretting that he had mistakenly believed in the "Peace Movement." He now only asks the court to handle the case fairly. The court ordered a postponement for further questioning.

Hu was a native of Jurong, Jiangsu, 40 years old, residing at 633 Haige Road. He graduated from the Law Department of Beiping University of Fire in his early years and studied constitutional law in Japan. After returning to China, he served as Secretary of the Central Political Committee, Special Committee Member, and Secretary of the National Defense Supreme Council. Hu was originally the brother-in-law of the traitor Luo Junqiang and had known the traitor Zhou Fohai for a long time. When the War of Resistance broke out, Luo, Zhou, and other traitors followed the traitor Wang Jingwei in seeking peace with the enemy. Hu also came to Shanghai from Chongqing via Hong Kong in the autumn of the 28th year of the Republic [1939] to participate in the "Peace Movement."

When the traitor Hu Zewu arrived in court yesterday, he was wearing a long blue cloth robe and half-worn yellow leather shoes. He was a burly man. According to his testimony, he only did administrative work while holding positions in the puppet regime, did not engage in "politics," and often shut himself up to reflect and read. During his half-year in Anhui, he devoted himself to managing the Huai River, eliminating local ruffians, and never harmed the people. Judge Qiu immediately asked, "Aren't you harming the people by being a traitor? How many soldiers sacrificed and bled on the front lines, how many compatriots were displaced in the rear, can you traitors shirk your responsibility?" Hu replied, "This should be the responsibility of the main leaders. I was just helping out out of friendship." Judge Qiu rebuked, "You have feelings for your friends, but don't you have feelings for your country, for your nation, for your compatriots?" The traitor Hu's face turned red with shame; he remained silent. Judge Qiu, considering that the case still required investigation, ordered a postponement for further questioning.

Fang Lixiang

During the trial of Fang Lixiang, it was noted that Fang was a native of Guangdong, 37 years old, residing at 265, Lane 270, 4 Seymour Road. He graduated from the Engineering Department of National Fudan University and studied papermaking engineering at the Imperial University of Japan. In mid-April of the 29th year of the Republic [1940], he was introduced by the traitor Lin Baisheng to serve as a Senior Secretary in the Puppet Propaganda Department. In March of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], he also served as the Director of General Affairs of the Puppet National Movement Committee. He wore a wide, old, and faded long shirt, dirty, worn-out white leather shoes, and his beard and hair were unkempt. Regarding his positions in the puppet regime, he claimed to have been a chemistry teacher who was impoverished and ill, and that he only took the puppet position under duress, so the claim of willingly betraying the country was false. The prosecutor filed charges under Article 2, Section 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. The court ordered a postponement for further questioning.

Li Wenqi

Li Wenqi, another traitor, was also tried. Li was originally an officer in the Supplies Department of the 4th Detachment of the Shanghai Southern Advance Team of the Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army. In the summer of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], when the enemy puppets launched the Clear the Countryside campaign, Li came to Shanghai and became a secret agent for the Shanghai Southern Gendarmerie, secretly reporting the Deputy Adjutant of the Loyal Salvation Army, Wu Senlin, who was arrested and imprisoned, only to be released after the victory. However, Li denied the accusations. The court ordered a postponement for further investigation.

Traitor Zhang Deqin is Still Ill

The case of Zhang Deqin, the traitor and head of the Finance Department of the Puppet Zhejiang Provincial Government, was originally scheduled for questioning this morning. However, Zhang was unable to attend due to a heart condition, so the interrogation was postponed. Furthermore, yesterday afternoon, Presiding Judge Liu Yugui, together with Judges Cao Jun and Qiu Huan-ying, concluded the trial of the traitor Wang Defan in a joint court session. The sentencing is scheduled for 2:30 PM on May 11th.

### Airmail Postage Increase; Originally 23 Yuan, Now Changed to 50 Yuan

Post Office News: Previously, airmail postage was 23 yuan per item, of which 20 yuan was ordinary postage and the remaining 3 yuan was airmail postage. It is reported that this method was stipulated in March of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944]. At that time, ordinary postage was 2 yuan per letter. When ordinary postage was adjusted to 20 yuan per letter on October 1st of last year, airmail postage was not revised at the same time due to the initial stage of repatriation. However, the airmail fee of 3 yuan per ten centimeters of national currency was far from sufficient to cover expenses. Therefore, with the approval of the Executive Yuan, the airmail fee has been adjusted to 30 yuan per ten centimeters of national currency. Including the ordinary postage of 20 yuan, each letter costs 50 yuan. The city post office will implement this starting from the 4th of this month. It is also heard that the airmail fee will be entirely allocated to the airline for freight charges.

### Relief Materials for Fishery; Recommended Distribution Principles

Appeal by the Fisheries Construction Association

The China Fisheries Construction Association, in order to develop China's fisheries and improve the lives of fishermen, has telegraphed the United National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the National Political Consultative Council, the Executive Headquarters, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and others, stating that after this victory, the United Nations allocated fishery relief materials worth more than US$41 million, including 750 fishing boats of various types, 12,000 wooden boats of all sizes, 40 to 50 cold storage facilities, and more than 30 shipyards. The allied countries' goodwill is deeply appreciated. The association has gathered national fishery organizations and Chinese and foreign fishery experts to jointly discuss the matter, and believes that the distribution of the aforementioned fishery materials should be handled in accordance with the following three principles: First, fishery materials should be accepted by those engaged in fishing.

Third, the funds received from fishery materials should still be used for the development of fisheries.

Zhang Daofan, a member of the Central Committee, sent the seals to the National Art Association of China for review, and they were forwarded to the president after being approved. In the spring of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], the US State Department representative Mr. Luo expressed his gratitude to Gao for the president's appreciation of the two seals. In the autumn of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], Gao held personal anti-war seal exhibitions in Chengdu and Chongqing, mostly using quotations from ancient sages and leaders, with one sentence per seal, to encourage popular morale and promote justice. Heads of each branch of the central government, starting with President Lin Sen and including various ministers, provided inscriptions.

### Commemorating the May Fourth Movement; Various Groups Enthusiastically Participate; Telegram Sent to Chairman Chiang and Declaration Issued

[Our Own Report] Yesterday was the 27th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. All sectors of the city held a grand commemoration meeting at Yiyuan yesterday morning. Participants included dozens of units such as the Women's Association, Fudan University, Xiaoguang Middle School, Xinjian Middle School, Pudong Middle School, and Anhui Refugee Youth Group, totaling over 10,000 people. Order within the venue was maintained by military police, security guards, youth groups, boy scouts, and others. A police band attended and played music. The presidium of the meeting consisted of representatives from nine groups: the People's Freedom Protection Association, the Cultural Movement Committee, the Student Union, the Large Education Union, the Middle Education Union, the Small Education Union, the Education Association, the Women's Association, and the Youth Group: Tao Baichuan, Li Shouyong, Cao Jun, Qian Jianqiu, Xi Zhenyong, Hu Huaitian, Gao Wenbai, Li Chengxuan, and Fei Shusheng. Guests included Deputy Mayor He, Central Committee member Pan Gongzhan, Education Bureau Director Gu, and General Labor Union Zhou Xuexiang.

Completing the Mission; Striving for Peace and Unity

After performing the rituals, Chairman Tao Baichuan delivered a speech stating that the May Fourth Movement had a significant impact on consolidating the national foundation, awakening national consciousness, reforming culture, and promoting society. The current political situation is as unstable as it was during the May Fourth era, so today's youth should inherit the revolutionary spirit of May Fourth and strive for peace and unity to complete the unfinished mission of May Fourth. Deputy Mayor He, on behalf of Mayor Qian, exhorted the youth, stating that the task of reconstruction is a heavy responsibility, so they should work hard in their studies, not indulge in empty words, and immerse themselves in practical work. Only with real talent and knowledge can they shoulder this important task.

Youth Thought; Hasten Liberation and Freedom

Pan Gongzhan then gave a speech stating that today's commemoration of May Fourth should not only maintain this revolutionary, patriotic, and national spirit, but also promote and enhance it. Recalling that since the May Fourth Movement, through the success of the National Revolution and the Northern Expedition, to the victory of the eight-year War of Resistance, we have finally achieved victory. But now, there are those who want to destroy this beautiful result. A few days ago, it was reported in the newspapers that the Communist Party had signed a secret agreement with the Soviet Union in the Northeast. What are the terms of this agreement? If it is true, it is no different from the Twenty-One Demands. The government should be responsible for signing treaties with other countries. Our country and the Soviet Union have already signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, and no other treaties are allowed, let alone secret treaties. This fact is painful to say. What was the May Fourth Movement for 27 years ago? What was the eight-year War of Resistance for?

Pan continued, stating that the May Fourth Movement was also for the liberation of thought and freedom, but some young people, after leaving the "Confucian Shop," entered the "Marx Shop," idolizing Marx, Stalin, and Lenin. In this way, thought is not free, but equally constrained. Therefore, in today's new May Fourth Movement, young people should quickly withdraw from the "Marx Shop" and achieve true freedom of thought. Education Bureau Director Gu said that we should be open in our actions, not secretive, and act with conscience and conviction, which is the best way to love the country. At this point, it suddenly started to rain. The conference passed a telegram to Chairman Chiang and a nationwide appeal for unity, for the National Assembly to be convened as scheduled, for relief for refugee youth, for increasing teachers' salaries, and issued a declaration. The conference then adjourned. The planned parade was also canceled due to the rain.

On the same morning, the Shanghai branch of the "Literary Association" held a literary morning meeting at the Lyceum Theatre. Madame Sun Yat-sen also attended the meeting. The program included speeches by Ye Shengtao, Zhou Yutong, and Xu Guangping, poetry recitation by Li Jianwu, storytelling by Zhao Jingshen, and "Brother and Sister Reclamation" Yangko by Ouyang Shanzun and Li Lilian, as well as Kunqu Opera, flute, and violin performances.

### Sichuan Provincial Department of Education Revises Implementation Measures; Strengthens National Education in Border Areas; Handled Separately in Han and Non-Han Areas

[Special Dispatch from Chengdu] In order to strengthen national education in border areas, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education has recently revised the implementation measures for national education in border areas, dividing them into two categories: Han areas and non-Han areas. The main points are as follows:

Han Areas

(1) Centralized School Establishment: It is not sufficient to establish schools according to the bao due to lack of manpower and financial resources. Key locations should be selected to concentrate resources and establish central schools and national schools, without establishing them in every township or town to avoid waste. (2) Public Funding: All students should be boarding students, provided with meals. Poor children should receive two dan of rice per year, those less poor should receive five dou of rice, and those who can support themselves will not receive subsidies. (3) Opening Private Schools: The qualifications of teachers and the funding of private schools should be relaxed as much as possible, but attention should be paid to assessment and rewards.

Non-Han Areas

(1) Mobile Education: Starting from Han areas, good teachers should be selected and sent to gradually implement education, starting from nearby and moving further away. (2) Teacher Selection: Teachers should have a spirit of perseverance and good intelligence. Talented individuals should be selected from graduates of various normal schools and given short-term training. Their treatment should be preferential. The mandatory service period for those sent to border areas should be shortened from three years to one year to encourage them. (3) Number of Teachers: 10 to 15 teachers per county. (4) Supervision and Command: The existing Maohe, Bianding, and Folk Life Guidance Centers should increase their staff and funding to handle the education of people in various counties. (Quan)

However, due to tight credit, there was a tightening trend from time to time, and the majority were not without caution. Soon it fell back again. The Bank of China's allotment fluctuated around 1.62 million. After the allotment was completed, there was little special activity until noon. It struggled to reach 1.63 million. In the afternoon, people's hearts were slightly relieved, and finally it stabilized slightly. The result was a slight increase of 15,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments were 175,000, and bar silver and silver dollars were flat. Although the underground money market has seen some relaxation, the interest rate is still unwilling to ease, and still stands at around 20%. Next Monday, there will be a large amount of material settlement, which cannot be prevented.

There is no shortage of speculative purchases of U.S. dollars. The spread narrowed to 710 yuan for ten taels, and there were sporadic settlements. The morning opening was 2,230 yuan, then it rose all the way to 2,340 yuan, and then it slightly fell back, hovering around 2,290 yuan. There was little progress in the later market. The result was a good 50 yuan higher than the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were weak and then gradually stabilized. The results were 5 yuan higher for both new and old dollars. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 450 yuan, and the rupee was 550 yuan, both showing prosperity. The listing price of U.S. exchange rates remained flat.

### Gold Shipped from the United States to Shanghai

Totaling 390,000 Taels

[Central News Agency, This City News] In the midst of the stable gold price in this city, according to reporters from reliable sources, 393,000 taels of gold, divided into 121 large barrels, were shipped from the United States by the Sea Eagle Wheel. This morning, the Central Bank transported them all to the warehouse. Also this morning, the Central Bank sold a total of 518 taels of gold according to the needs of the gold shops and gold industry in this city, supplying them in full at the then market price of 1.62 million yuan. The number of legal tender returned to the Central Bank this week was extremely large, and the number of those who purchased foreign exchange from the Central Bank was also small, resulting in an extremely tight money market.

### The Yarn Market Turns Firm; Trading of Raw Cotton Comes to a Standstill

The yarn market has turned around yesterday. The Ningbo gang continued to show demand, and 20-count Double Horse rose by 20,000. The remaining miscellaneous brands were taken by the inland gangs who chose cheaper ones, and the price also rose by 10,000 to 30,000. The 42-count Double Strand thread has fallen sharply in recent days, which has aroused the demand of weaving factories. Sporadic transactions are quite lively. The weakness seems to have passed, and people's hearts have turned firm.

Yesterday, New York American cotton telegrams rose by 2 to 6 basis points. The near-term price was $27.58, the far-term price was $27.73, and the Milling spot price was $28.16. Raw cotton trading in this port has completely stalled. Because of the Saturday connection, and gold, U.S. dollars, and yarn prices have not developed in a special way, manufacturers and flower houses are watching and waiting, with no news of negotiations.

### Silk Is Soft

Fangjian Opens and Sells Rayon

Yesterday, the opening price of rayon No. 120 at Tianqiao in the morning was 1.48 million yuan. The highest bid was 1.54 million yuan. As a result, the closing price was 1.51 million yuan. In the afternoon, because the allotted silk was shipped that day, people's hearts were weak, and it fell back slightly, trading at 1.45 million yuan, 20,000 yuan shorter than the previous day, and miscellaneous brands were 30,000 yuan shorter. The remaining goods of each number remained at the original prices of the previous day. Factory transactions were quiet. Foreign firm goods only had inquiries and no transactions. 81-point evenness Dachang offered a price of 2.5 million yuan. User silk had some transactions, and each grade was about 50,000 yuan shorter. Silk goods were flat and weak. Meiya quilt covers had a transaction at 1.05 million yuan in the morning, and Dacheng checks were 3,760 yuan per yard.

Also, enemy rayon, handled by enemy property management, has been entrusted to the China Textile Construction Company to sell. The company publicly listed the price yesterday, and the sales method is the same as the situation of selling cotton yarn. It is said that the quantity is very large, and it is now actively counting, and it is decided to sell it publicly once a week.

### The Tea Market Is Gradually Entering Its Prime; Foreign Firms Have Begun to Handle Goods

The tea market has been gradually entering its prime in recent days, with active buying interest. Especially the Tianjin gang has a tendency to accept all comers for Baozhong and Zhulan tea. Holders are taking the opportunity to call high, so the price is gradually increasing. Other colors are also being added by stores and shops on this street and in Suzhou. The market is generally firm.

On the foreign firm side, the demand in Europe and the United States is quite strong at present. Although the new tea has already appeared, the tea for export has not yet been made. Now, Jardine Matheson is selecting goods with excellent quality to meet the urgent need. It is reported that Chen Zhenmei has completed 200 boxes (the price is 32,000 yuan per dan). It is planned to be sold to Morocco in Africa within a few days. As for Mumbai, India, it is also frequently favored. Recently, the Baitou Zhuang Ruichang Foreign Firm purchased 700 boxes of Chou Gong (the price is 38,000 yuan per dan) and is waiting for the opportunity to export it.

### Public Bonds Continue to Rise; The Stock Market Wants to Revive but Is Powerless

Public bonds will start to meander again next week. Each active element is unstable due to the unstable terrain. Although they want to cheer up, they finally feel weak. As a result, it is inevitable that they will soften at the beginning of the opening, once falling back to the 5,500 yuan level. After that, the money market gradually relaxed, and there was no particularly panic-inducing stimulation, so it rose back to around 6,150 yuan. At noon, it hovered outside the 6,000 yuan level. As a result, it rose slightly by 150 yuan compared to the previous close. A, B, and D rose from 3,850 yuan to 4,300 yuan, a rebound of 450 to 500 yuan. E-type ended with a high price of 4,500 yuan from a weak 4,000 yuan, an increase of 350 yuan. Chinese stocks have also slightly improved due to the tense situation in recent days. However, because retail investors are too hasty, the staying power is insufficient, and the high price is weak. At noon, it ended at a low price. In the middle, the highest Yongsha was 5,600 yuan, Meiya was 4,730 yuan, Jingfu was 475 yuan, Xinguang was 390 yuan, and Qinxing was 340 yuan. Then, it was gradually suppressed by the multiple parties' sales. The noon collection became worse and worse, and the bid was lower and lower as time passed. As a result, compared with the previous hot two hot ones, it continued to fall slightly, and the three small ones have returned to show, and the rise and fall of the colder stocks are limited. Foreign stocks rose slightly at the beginning of the market. Yisha struggled at 14,900 yuan. Soon, Chinese stocks could not support themselves and retreated. The stocks followed Yisha to the lower reaches. As a result, Yisha fell 900 yuan, and Yinglian fell 1,400. Although the remaining stocks fell but not much.

### The Sales of Sugar Are Flat; The Supply of Xianglian Goods Is Short and Prices Rise

Yesterday, the trend of the sugar market turned flat. The market price of medium-sized white sugar in the Association's disk revolved between 59,000. The initial market was 59,000 yuan, up to 59,500 yuan. It once reached 60,000 yuan. In the end, it was still 59,000 yuan. The goods opened, and the transaction was very scattered. It is because the market party is aware that the market image is not stable and dare not be greedy.

Xianglian has turned tighter due to the lack of stock and storage. It was found that the previous price was around 200,000 yuan. Now, those with good color and large particles have risen to 225,000 yuan.

### Siamese Rice Exports Are Expected to Reach 60,000 Tons Per Month

[Reuters Singapore, 4th] Southeast Asian envoy Lord Killearn broadcasted yesterday that the United Food Board estimated that Siam and Burma could export 280,000 tons of rice in the second quarter of this year, but the actual export volume is likely to be no more than 153,000 tons. If transportation is not accelerated, the situation will inevitably become more serious. Since January 1, Siam has exported 114,000 tons of rice. It is hoped that 60,000 tons can be exported every month in the future.

### The Price of Black Tea for Export Is Above That of Ceylon

The production cost of black tea for export from China is about 67,000 yuan per dan. The current price in Shanghai is about 90,000 yuan. Adding transportation insurance and other expenses, it is actually more than 100,000 yuan. It is reported that the market price of Ceylon black tea in the United States is now 30 cents per pound, which is about 78,000 yuan per dan, which is lower than the domestic market price in China. Therefore, it is difficult to compete with Ceylon tea.

### The Timber Market Is Stagnant

Yesterday, the timber market was quite stagnant. It was heard that more than 2 million feet of Yangsong had arrived at the port, and people's hearts were softened. In the market, there was no master to receive a large amount of transactions. However, sporadic color assignments were still not lonely. Hangzhou wood and Dantong have been selling well recently.

### Britain, America and Siam Manage to Set Exchange Rates

[Associated Press Bangkok, 4th] The official exchange rate between the Siamese currency and the pound sterling was set at 40 to 1 yesterday. The Siamese currency is now worth one U.S. dollar for every ten yuan. According to the previous semi-official exchange rate, every sixty Siamese yuan is equal to one pound, and every fifteen yuan is equal to one U.S. dollar.

### The Price of Rice Fluctuates; Flour and Miscellaneous Grains Rebound

Yesterday, the digestion of the rice market was very stagnant. Japonica and indica yuan rice fell by about 1,000 yuan. After the flour fell continuously, the sales of the stores became smoother, and rebounded by 300 to 400 yuan. The oil market turned active sporadically. Ningbo Bang asked about it slightly. The price stopped falling and rebounded, rebounding by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The sales of bean cake followed suit, and also rose by 500 to 600 yuan. The bran husk Xiangxiao also moved, and it rose sharply by 800 to 900 yuan. Yellow soybeans rose by more than 1,000 yuan due to the rise in prices of various commodities. Raw kernels were tired and revived, and also increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. However, red grains had little magic and were stagnant. Cotton cake was still downstream. Yesterday's market was the opposite of the previous day. The price of rice fell back, and the price of oil cake miscellaneous grains and flour bran rose in unison. According to the rice market, it was reported yesterday that there were a total of 4,000 stones of white japonica and other 7 types in this city. The types and stones are as follows: white japonica 2,066, thin rice 1,098, early rice 63, Sanyang indica 105, Du indica 433, Bai Yuan 75, Yin Yuan 70.

### Tung Oil Costs Are Too High; Export Transactions Are Suspended

The Chinese Plant Oil Factory purchased more than 300 tons of tung oil in winter last year in Wan and other places in Chongqing. After burning and canning in Wan, it started to be transported this spring. It was transported by wooden boats in the Wanyi section, by tugboats in the Yihan section, and by wheels in the Hanshu section. The cost of transshipment is also high. It is reported that it costs about 30,000 yuan per city dan to transport from Wan to Shanghai. It takes half a year from purchase to loading and arriving in Shanghai.

The first batch of more than 100 tons of Sichuan Tung oil from the factory has recently arrived in this city. This batch of tung oil has been delivered to the Soviet Union for barter by the Central Trust Bureau. The remaining 100 tons can be shipped within this month.

According to reports, the recent tung price in the inland is 39,000 yuan in Chongqing, 38,000 yuan in Wanxian, and 52,300 yuan in Hankou (based on each market in sufficient degree tung oil). The Shanghai price is currently weaker due to weak domestic sales, and exporters are watching and waiting, and only hovering around 72,000 yuan. Merchants can no longer profit from transporting and selling in Shanghai from the place of origin.

It is reported that although the United States needs tung oil from China, it is limited by the market price. The current purchase price offered by the U.S. merchants in Shanghai is only 37 cents per pound (U.S. dollars), and it must be delivered to the wheel. Since the shippers do not calculate it, the trade of tung oil to the United States in the past two months has not been concluded except for the original transactions.

### Bristles Are Not Selling Well; Due to the Prevalence of Nylon

[Chongqing News] In the international market, the price of bristles has a downward trend. According to a report two weeks ago, 27th-grade domestic goods were worth 3 U.S. dollars a pound, delivered in New York, worth about 600,000 legal currency per dan. With the current Chongqing price plus other expenses, the cost of shipping to the United States is nearly 900,000 yuan per dan, in which case it is possible to lose 2300,000 yuan per dan. The main reason why bristles have entered this depression is the application of nylon. The raw materials are easy to obtain, the cost is also light, and the finished products are durable, while the quality of bristles is poor and not practical. Therefore, if you want to save this decline and regain the foreign market for bristles, you can only find ways to refine them and reduce costs.

### Money Exchange Industry Appeals to Apply for Currency Trading

[Central News Agency, This City News] There are currently 188 members of the Municipal Money Exchange Industry Association. The scope of business in peacetime is to specialize in the buying and selling of currencies of various countries. According to Article 3 of the Provisional Measures for the Management of Foreign Exchange, they are called Class A licensed operators. Among the members who have been approved by the Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Review, there are only 81 members. The remaining 107 members misunderstood the provisions of the regulations at that time, and did not study the application procedures in detail. They voluntarily gave up their rights. Now, those who hold vouchers are in danger of having their business suspended, and their own business is mainly based on the purchase and sale of foreign currency banknotes. Once they are suspended, they will be unable to maintain their livelihoods. The board of directors has been convened to make a statement to remedy the situation. This morning, President Wang Yuncheng personally went to the Foreign Exchange Review Office to appeal for supplementary registration in order to save the livelihoods of the members.

### Business Summary

Western Medicine: Consigners compete to sell out in view of the inflow of foreign goods, and the spot price falls again.

Chemical Raw Materials: The price of gold and U.S. dollars has fallen in recent days, and the raw materials have also fallen with it. The market is flat.

Leather: Generally stable, but the surface is slightly softened, and the transaction is not strong.

### Expensive Telegraph Fees Hinder Exports

[Chongqing News] According to import merchants, my country's foreign trade has gradually become active recently. However, the foreign telegraph prices set by the government are not suitable for export conditions. For example, the government stipulates that at least 25 characters must be sent each time, and those who do not have 25 characters will still be charged according to this number. In addition, the recently reported fee has increased from 3,250 yuan to 19,000 yuan, which is six times higher than before, which invisibly increases the cost of export goods. This type of reporting method hinders the development of export trade. It is hoped that the government will reduce it to suit the export trade.

Theater Review

### Review of "Promotion Chart"

— Family

Dreams are inspiration, not illusion. Chen Baichen writes in his play "Promotion Chart": I know this play "Promotion Chart" will sting a small group of people, but it is a universally existing reality. Whoever denies it is hiding their illness from the doctor. Whoever acknowledges its reality has the courage to improve it.

The performance of "Promotion Chart" swept away the past sluggish box office of spoken drama, not only because of the novelty of copper coin eyes, safes, and other devices, and the cartoonish makeup... "Promotion Chart" gained the love of a large audience because the playwright, director, designer, and actors expressed the audience's own feelings, hatred, and curses towards this group of characters in this play. The audience laughed together because the embarrassment of the characters on stage alleviated their depression and increased their contempt for this group of people. The laughter was filled with the meaning of "boo."

However, the sensational success of this performance cannot solely rely on the original author. If a clumsy director, stage designer, or actor were to encounter it, they could make a brilliant script lose its color. Putting a cartoonish exterior on this comedy "Promotion Chart" made the content and characters of the script more prominent. It made the ugliness hidden in reality more obvious and also gave the staff more space to unleash their imagination to the fullest extent. How lifeless this script would become if realistic techniques were used!

The set is where the characters appear and disappear. It must be able to represent the characteristics of this group of protagonists. Designer Ding Cong designed the set with only one hall, opening the central hall as a "copper coin eye," the walls are banknotes, the door is a money cabinet, and a large piece of "loot" is hanging in mid-air. Therefore, what exactly is this group of characters who come and go through the copper coin eyes, enter and exit the money cabinet, carrying loot on their heads, and facing banknotes? The audience can see it at a glance. The same design in the characters' costumes also follows the principle of abstracting personality. The most distinctive is naturally the Director of the Finance Bureau, who wears yuanbao on his head, steps on yuanbao, wears banknotes, and carries three bags of exorbitant taxes. The Director of Education is no less impressive, wearing a doctoral hat and a long robe of the Four Books and Five Classics. On the other hand, the makeup also tends towards a cartoon style. The face of the Police Chief is simply Hitler. The only character whose makeup is not based on their own position is the Director of Public Works. Where is the Director of Public Works? It is actually a modern "Hu Si"! What a pungent satire!

The best actor is Lan Ma as the Provincial Governor. When he is serious, he is so solemn and dignified, his actions are so heavy, and when he is smiling, he is also full of the demeanor of someone in high position. He did not flaunt his skills to create colorful brilliance, but his brilliance is intrinsic. A frown, a smile, a raise of a hand, a step, are simple and natural. His acting skills have reached a state of perfection. Zhou Qi is very outstanding in portraying the Director of the Finance Bureau's demeanor of absolute power. The Director of Education's two-facedness and the Secretary-General's shrewd cunning all have their unique qualities.

The director has an absolute and significant influence on the performance. Huang Zuolin not only handled the entire stage lively and orderly in this play, but also sharply and thoroughly. In the third act, he allowed the Provincial Governor to appear on stage naked, wearing only a bellyband. After enough gold bars were collected, they were stored on the spot in the bags on the bellyband, and then he put on the golden and solemn coat in front of the audience. In the second act, when the county government held a meeting to punish the murderers, the directors all used dialects to express their opinions, which were all excellent. However, the language of the entire play is Mandarin, which is inconsistent with the second act. This should be because that scene was specially emphasized!

Chen Baichen wrote: "No author, when bathing in the sunlight, is willing to return to the dark room to find inspiration." I praise this performance and hope not to see such performances again.

Qin Yi and Liu Qiong are in "Zhongdian"'s new film "Loyal and Righteous Family" which is being filmed.

### Chongqing Theater News

The Bian Theater Troupe performed "Wilderness" at the Anti-Japanese Hall in Chongqing. On the last day, Li Jian, the famous veteran actress who played Jiao Daxian, suddenly fainted on stage when shaking hands with Qiu Hu in the second act due to overwork and anemia.

The China Drama and Art Society, led by Ying Yunwei, is currently rushing to rehearse three plays: "Under the Eaves of Shanghai," "Wedding March," and "Qu Yuan," to be staged after "Promotion Chart."

### News from the Film Studio

— Lang Qin

"Zhongdian" Second Factory has been working day and night recently. "Loyal and Righteous Family," directed by Wu Yonggang, has been filmed halfway. All staff members have a highly pleasant working spirit.

"Loyal and Righteous Family" has one outdoor set, which is quite magnificent. According to people who have worked in the film industry for a long time; Shanghai has not seen such a large set for many years.

The second program of "Zhongdian" Second Factory is Chen Liting's "Distant Love," with women's issues as the theme. The storyboard has been completed and filming can begin in mid-May. Zhao Dan's script is being written, and Xu Suling is also preparing a script, intending to start filming after "Loyal and Righteous Family" is completed.

"Zhongdian" Third Factory (Beijing) has been actively promoting film production since director Shen Fu arrived in Beijing. Shen Fu is burying himself in shot breakdown. As soon as Wei Heling and Xie Tian arrive, work can begin.

Fei Mu's "Cultural Combatant" has begun filming on location in Suzhou. Fei Mu returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday and will go to work in Suzhou with the female lead, Wang Renmei, and others tomorrow.

After Ms. Hu Die came to Shanghai, she lived a secluded life and will be traveling to the United States. It is said that before Ms. Hu leaves the country, "Zhongdian" intends to invite her to star in a film.

The Lianhua factory site in Xujiahui, which was once leased by the puppet "China Film," has now been reviewed and decided by the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau to be returned to the original owner, it is said.

### Deformed Film Industry

— Xin Ming

After reading Chen Weijun's film review of "Emerging Lotus" in this publication on April 14th, I feel that the film industry in Shanghai after the victory is really too unconventional and too undisciplined. There are many Hollywood-style sexy films with added color. If you don't believe it, you can see a large number of advertisements on newsprint every day that attract color-hungry audiences to indulge themselves! What "fighting for beauty in shallow pools, comparing flesh under triangular pants." "Jade legs," "golden legs," "beautiful legs," endless legs. Of course, not every film is like this. For example, the recent films "The Story of Woodrow Wilson," "Loyal and Courageous Family," "Guardians of the Rhine," and "The Bells of Adano" are all pure in meaning and deeply moving after watching them. They help you increase your knowledge, instill proper culture, and introduce great figures in front of you, making you admire and worship them. However, the Shanghai audience is naive and curious, and most of the audience simply doesn't understand English. Therefore, they only seek magic, dazzling colors, and fascinating kisses. Going to the cinema is only for temporary pleasure. As a result, when the latter films are released, there are few people in front of the cinema, and the box office is terrible.

In this situation, in order to do business, the theater owners have no choice but to show popular films and abandon literary films with dim business prospects. Isn't that a deformed film industry? I can't help but sigh to myself.

Even more serious is the impact: countless young men and women in Shanghai, including college students, middle school students, young civil servants, shop clerks, etc., feel that watching movies is a legitimate form of entertainment and a legitimate pastime. Therefore, they also go to the cinema on Sundays and holidays to spend two hours. However, I think that when a young person sees the pornographic films mentioned above, he will be confused and easily introduced into the abyss of pornography, abandoning his studies and career. Therefore, I appeal to all ladies and gentlemen in the city who love movies to stop showing movies that are extremely pornographic and absurd!

### Request to the Ministry of Education to Add an Examination Center in Shanghai

Many Benefits for Candidates

Editor Sir: I recently read in your newspaper's education section the Ministry of Education's announcement of the regulations for self-funded study abroad examinations. The examination location section did not include Shanghai. This city has always been the cultural center of our country, with many universities. The number of applicants will inevitably be large. If there is no examination center in this city, everyone will have to go to Nanjing to take the exam. Transportation is inconvenient, and finding accommodation is even more difficult. Time and energy will be lost. I admire your newspaper as the voice of the people. I dare to ask you to forward this to the education authorities and relevant public opinion organizations (such as the Municipal Council, etc.) to request the addition of an examination center in Shanghai. This will greatly benefit the candidates in this city. I wish you peace.

Sincerely, Ji Qingyuan

Special Edition on the Return of the National Government to the Capital

### Remembering Chongqing

We, who have already journeyed eastward today, gaze westward at the majestic mountain city standing proudly at the confluence of the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers, and read these life stories with piercing hearts, as its seasonal dense fog, from hazy to gradually clear.

We bid farewell to Chongqing, reluctant to part.

Chongqing, once brought us light, hope, justice, victory, excitement, life, and even more so, warmth. It is like the holy city of Jerusalem, symbolizing and entrusting not only the devout faith of all Chinese people. It is the most glorious and dearest place name, which we Chinese call out with great pride.

Eight years of time, boundless hardships, every house, every slope, every bridge pier, every stone cave, every pool of river water, every road, every tree, every flower, every blade of grass, every piece of soil, has written the most touching and unforgettable stories, with blood, with tears, with hunger, with cold, with joy, with anger. It is she, who has carried this all, and engraved this all.

We, who have already journeyed eastward today, gaze westward at the majestic mountain city standing proudly at the confluence of the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers, we will silently shed tears, reading these life stories with piercing hearts, as its seasonal dense fog, from hazy to gradually clear.

The Qingnian Road and Shangqing Temple area will first appear in our memories. It was the nerve center of the Anti-Japanese War: the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Central Party Headquarters, the Supreme National Defense Council, the General Mobilization Conference, the Ministry of Transportation, the Wartime Production Bureau, the Resources Commission, etc. Fifty percent of the major institutions were concentrated here. Therefore, this area became particularly active with public servants. Every day around 8:00 in the morning, 12:00 noon, and 5:00 in the afternoon, people bustled back and forth, and the bus waiting area, a long snake formation, lined up for half a street, regardless of the scorching sun or torrential rain, this was the most crowded and congested time.

The temple-like building of the National Government, facing the spacious National Government Road, expressed solemnity amidst tranquility and cleanliness, with a myriad of sights. In addition to the memorial week every Monday morning, many major ceremonies of the government were held here. When the late Chairman Lin Sen was critically ill, countless citizens who loved and respected him gathered in front of its doors every day, reading the condition reports with the most sorrowful hearts.

Winding south from Shangqing Temple, the wartime capital also only had this winding avenue, Zhongshan Road, Roads One, Two, and Three, until the Jiangsu Fellow Association at Qixinggang. This was a relatively high section of Chongqing, and also the main artery on the north side of the entire mountain city. Among them, the highest point was Pipashan, Feilai Temple, the location of the Soviet Embassy. Every year on the anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Union and Red Army Day, there was a constant stream of traffic, and it was extremely prosperous.

On this section of the road, there were the Broadcasting Building, the Central Propaganda Department, the International Propaganda Office, the Organization Department, the Personnel Examination Department, the Foreign Correspondents' Reception Center, the United States Information Service, the Central News Agency, the Four Allied Offices, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Food, the Garrison Headquarters, the Ordnance Department, and the Central Daily News. On the high slope of Chunyang Cave, there were also the China Film Studio and the Kangjian Hall, famous for its drama performances. This was the heartland section, both in terms of the topography of the entire mountain city and the activities of the citizens.

We, who are in Shanghai today, take rickshaws or pedicabs and pass over Sichuan Road Bridge and Tianhou Palace Bridge. Invariably, someone pushes you up, and in the end, you have to spend a hundred-yuan bill. However, compared to the slope from Min Sheng Road, the Joseph's Church to Guanyinyan, this poor man's section, we will lament the strength of the Chongqing rickshaw pullers, and feel ashamed of the pamperedness of people in the plains.

Creating the environment, adapting to the environment, being led by the environment, human intelligence can roughly be divided into these three levels. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, most of the people who fled from the southeast to the southwest were trained by the environment to climb mountains and cross ridges, walking briskly as if flying. This was just a small episode in life, just like eating rationed rice and entering air-raid shelters, becoming a daily scene. They adapted to the environment, and they further created the environment, stirring their hearts and holding back their tears. The tempering of the spirit cultivated the nation's indomitable spirit. The stone steps of Wanglongmen, the stone steps of Shibati, the stone steps of the Triumphal Arch, these small things, we miss them. Imperceptibly, the role they played, the impact on our body and mind, will be worth singing praises to!

Speaking of the Triumphal Arch, it and the Jiangbian cable car of Wanglongmen were both huge new construction projects in Chongqing after the National Government moved its capital. The former was built by the Tianfu Construction Company. Because of it, the upper city and the lower city were connected, and traffic flowed freely, like from Fuzichi to Dapingmen, no longer having to detour far to Nanqu Park or Daomenkou. Its arched Qiongmen, viewed from the front of the Military Affairs Commission, was quite magnificent.

The Jiangbian cable car of Wanglongmen was built by the China Bridge Company, presided over by Mr. Mao Yisheng. The construction process was quite similar to the construction of the western railway in the United States in those years. Even the Municipal Council used it as an important agenda item. A group of officials made all kinds of absurd arguments and opposed it fiercely. Mr. Mao, who had designed and supervised the Qiantang River Bridge, sat upright in the office on the second floor of the company in Lianglukou, and did not delay the progress of the project for a single day. Mr. Mao finally breathed a sigh of relief when the cable car officially started operating. Today, people traveling between the north and south banks of the Yangtze River, avoiding the fatigue of climbing up and down more than two hundred stone steps, have they ever thought of the painful feelings of a first-class Chinese engineering expert under attack from all sides during this year and a half from the summer of 1934 to the autumn of 1935?

We should also start with the Jiangsu Fellow Association in Qixinggang. Let's assume that we are sitting on a city bus, and then heading south, down the narrow, steep, and sharply curved slope of Minsheng Road. The scene of a "fishing" car overturning often took place here.

Minsheng Road, formerly known as Wuku Street, can now be called Cultural Street. Large and small bookstores gathered together. The storefront of the Xinhua Daily often staged lively visibility scenes here, such as the shooting of an officer, the conflict of the 2/22 student parade,... The spire church of Joseph's Church, having survived the great bombing, stood tall and unharmed, still spending every morning and evening.

Jiaochangkou, a large square, was usually like the City God Temple in Shanghai. Street performers and various acts were on display, and vendors and stalls shouted and babbled. After a circus dismantled its canopy, the problem of the chairman of the congress created an "incident" that made it famous throughout the country.

The bus turned north here and drove onto Minzu Road (Guanmiao Street, Douyou Street, Dashizi), the essence of the city's commerce. Its sides were lined with shops, companies, and firms, and the road was wide and flat. The branches on the left and right with it as the main trunk were very neat. Movie theaters, Sichuan opera houses, Beijing opera theaters, restaurants, and taverns stood like stars surrounding the moon.

The Spiritual Fortress was formerly Dashizi. It was slightly smaller than Xinjiekou Square in Nanjing. Chairman Chiang accepted the cheers of the city's citizens here. Now, the national flag raising and lowering ceremonies are held here twice a day, morning and evening.

At the Xiaoshizi of Zhongzheng Road, there stood a standard clock, which reported the accurate time to the people in the banking district. But for a period of time, it also became the object of citizens' satire.

The banking district included Shaanxi Street, Daomenkou, and Datong Street. The trading skills of the Shaanxi people are indeed admirable. As early as many years ago, the Shaanxi people controlled the finance of Sichuan. They left this street, which still exerted the power of Wall Street during the Anti-Japanese War. This was a concentration of wealth, with countless banks, money houses, companies, and firms, the place where the national economic pulse beat the most sensitively.

Then, the car arrived at the terminal stop, Guojielou. Pedestrians were mixed, but they wanted to go to Shangqing Temple. They lined up in a long line, waiting for buses that were panting, shaking their heads, and moving slowly. Although people hated the unsound transportation, when they thought that these "old cars" had also traveled thousands of miles from the occupied areas to support themselves here with heavy responsibilities, they would sympathize with its suffering and endure, endure, endure, and endure.

Linsen Road, Nanqu Road, overlooking the Yangtze River, had buses running on it for a period of time, but now it was only possible to walk. This section had the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Central Park, and the Military Affairs Commission. Further on, the Zhonghang Company's Shanba Airport was located on a sandbar in the river. During the high water levels of the Yangtze River in spring and autumn, the sandbar disappeared, so the airport buildings were temporary sheds.

Then came the semi-mountainous Nanqu Park.

It is regrettable that the earthworks and several rusty rails of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway are still lying lonely below Nanqu Park. We have been in Sichuan for eight years, and we have not completed this transportation artery, which is only over five hundred kilometers long.

Passing through Caiyuanba, the parachute tower stood tall, and from time to time, soft parachutes gently descended in the air, weaving the special customs of the great wartime capital.

Looking north to Jiangbei, Zengjiayan; looking south to Chunyang Cave; and looking at Chongqing, the best place is to stand on the Nantianmen of Ma'anshan.

The scenery is infinitely good, and the affairs of people change a lot. The air-raid shelters of Chongqing, how many words do you remember it telling us? How many words do you remember us calling out to it!

(Bu Shaofu, Shanghai, on the eve of May Fourth, 1946)

Order for the National Government to Return to the Capital

…Recalling that in these eight years, the enemy has penetrated deeply and suffered heavy losses. If it were not for relying on the vast people of our western region and relying on its abundant land resources, we would not have been able to establish the foundation for today's victory. Sichuan, known as the Land of Abundance in ancient times, is the root of national strength. The Chongqing area controls the north and south with its two rivers, and occupies a strategic location. Therefore, it was able to safely overcome difficulties and achieve victory. Its great contribution to the country will be forever recorded in history and will never be erased…

Special Issue Commemorating the Return of the National Government to the Capital, Part 2

### Four Nanjings

When the Ministry of Transportation's land, sea, and air routes were insufficient to complete the May Capital Return Plan, the Aeronautical Affairs Commission received an order to assist in the return of the capital. Director Zhou Zhirou immediately prepared thirty C-47 and C-49 transport planes to assist in the return of the capital between Chongqing and Nanjing every day. When the Aeronautical Affairs Commission began its assistance, Director Zhou told the commanders of the units in charge of air transport and the personnel of the Chongqing Jiulongpo Airport and the Nanjing Ming Palace Airport, "In the sky, we are the masters. Not only must you ensure the flight safety of the capital return personnel, but you must also make them enjoy the comfort of being guests. In this way, our air force can not only gallop to the front line to kill enemies in wartime, but also serve in peacetime."

The Air Force Works Hard

The Chongqing Jiulongpo Airport is located on the banks of the Yangtze River, about a twenty-minute car ride from the city. Countless Chinese and foreign guests have come and gone through here. Those who have traveled to and from Chongqing by air all know the image of this dam outside of the dam in the water (Shanba Airport). It is about ten meters above the water surface, with hills on one side and the muddy yellow river water fifty meters below on the other. Passengers on planes taking off from Jiulongpo Airport have the relaxed feeling of "I am rising from the bottom of the water."

In Jiulongpo, after the capital return personnel entered the airport, they rested in a large living room with eight windows to be grouped and weigh their luggage. Then, they were called by name and assigned a boarding number to board the plane. After each person's luggage was weighed, it was carried by airport soldiers to the plane. Before boarding, each person was given a meal by the Aeronautical Affairs Commission, which contained a small package of chocolate, a package of biscuits, a small package of dried beef, and a small package of [missing text].

In Nanjing, the team in charge of this air transport was Zhang Guangming's team. This man was tall and thin like the American star, Jorah, and spoke Mandarin with a northeastern accent. Every day from morning to dusk, he was in the radio station, the Ming Palace Airport control tower, and the air transport team headquarters, using the phone to arrange and command. He had been wounded in a battle with Japanese planes in Guide. When he parachuted down, Japanese planes strafed his parachute and shot at him. After recovering from his injuries, he had spent three years guarding the border in Xinjiang. He loved riding horses and hunting. He rode along the Yili River for twelve days without dismounting. His energy was so abundant. After the victory last summer, he had been engaged in air transport in Xinjiang for a long time. He was a capable assistant to Captain Yi Fun.

Although the weather in Beijing and Chongqing during the Aeronautical Affairs Commission's air transport in April was sometimes unpredictable, no danger ever occurred. In total, more than 4,000 capital return personnel were transported to the capital in twenty days.

Passing Resolutions and Both Nanjing Radio Stations Were the Busiest Units in This Capital Return Air Transport. Wang Yangzhou, the chief mechanic at the Chongqing station, made sure that the motors never broke down. The two airports were especially busy. Yang Jian, the station chief of Ming Palace Airport, reduced his sleeping time by half. This peacetime busyness can train the air force's young men's sense of responsibility. In the future, when there are large-scale air transport and troop transfers, this training will be equivalent to a rehearsal.

Welcoming the Capital Return Personnel

Mayor Ma Chao has lived a hard life with the people of Chongqing in Chongqing for eight years. He is an old man of about sixty who deeply understands the feelings and needs of those returning to the capital. Although prices in Beijing are lower than in Shanghai, the worthlessness of the legal tender is still the same as it was in Chongqing. Therefore, this master of Nanjing could not satisfy the capital return personnel with the three items of clothing, food, and housing. This major problem of life and economy does not seem to be solved by a mayor alone. If everyone's life is prosperous and the social economy is based on and conforms to the "Principle of People's Livelihood," then our country's level will be high enough. Apart from clothing, food, and housing, some of the municipal administration within the scope of the municipal government that should be developed and reformed have made very rapid progress. In Nanjing, the price of hotel rooms is currently only between 2,000 and 3,000 yuan. Small hotels are also comfortable for 1,000 yuan a day. This is a phenomenon that no other city has. In terms of the catering industry, a 500-yuan restaurant can satisfy hunger and [missing text]. In terms of transportation, the thousands of potholes on Zhongshan Road and Taiping Road have been filled with asphalt. Whether you take a rickshaw or ride a bicycle, you don't have to detour to avoid the bumps in the potholes on any main road. In terms of transportation, the small trains in Beijing travel between Xiaguan and the city center, Gulou and Confucius Temple, to outside Zhonghua Gate. More than 100,000 passengers ride every day. It can be said that it is the most convenient public tool. The fees are as low as long-distance railway [missing text]. Although the prices of water, electricity, and coal are expensive, there have never been any water or power outages. Although garbage removal and the demolition of damaged houses were carried out by [missing text] Japanese [missing text] officials, some of the municipal government staff also put in a lot of effort. In addition to wearing glasses to approve official documents in the office every day, the sixty-year-old Mayor Ma often travels east and west by car to the work site to supervise and direct himself. An Air Force captain who had just arrived in Nanjing once did not know that the suburban road from Guanghua Gate to Dajiaochang was being renovated. He drove a jeep from the city out of Guanghua Gate to Dajiaochang. At Guanghua Gate, a sturdy old man in a suit waved a red flag to stop his jeep, shouting loudly:

"The road surface is not dry from this road renovation, you should take the Zhonghua Gate road."

Later, the military police told him that this was the mayor, and he admired him infinitely in his heart. What is even more admirable is that the mayor supervised the construction and repaired the long road from Dajiaochang Airport to Guanghua Gate in twenty days. He was like fighting a war, wherever it was urgent, he placed himself in that place.

New Nanjing Scenery

In Nanjing, Xuanwu Lake outside Xuanwu Gate is a landscape painting that can be compared with the mausoleum. The entire energy of the Nanjing Municipal Garden Management Office is focused on the renovation of Xuanwu Lake Park. Not only the Americans who are good at appreciating natural beauty say that the scenery of Xuanwu Lake is a lake area that they have not found in those combat areas that they have run all over the earth, but even the Sichuanese capital return personnel whose enjoyment power has been numbed by war life also praised it endlessly.

The spring flowers and plants along Xuanwu Lake are now moving towards summer. The cherries are ripe, the willow branches are lush, and the voices of the boat girls welcoming guests are endless: "Do you want to paddle a small boat?"

The spring water is full on the lake, and the green reeds on the shore are budding and growing. With three days of touring the lake after the war-numbed mind, you can be sure to restore your original spirit. In order to increase the food supply on the lake and provide convenience to tourists, the Garden Management Office [missing text]

In order to enable the lake people to express the spirit and [missing text] of the citizens of the capital, Mayor Ma's wife ran a tutoring school in the heart of the lake park. For ten years, Mayor Ma's wife has always loved to engage in social education. The girls who follow her in doing things can become outstanding social welfare or social education leaders in a few years. Her requirements for doing things are quite high. The girls who follow Ma's wife often say: "Although the madam is kind, she is strict and serious in doing things, almost like a man."

Naturally, there is still much work to be done in welcoming the capital return personnel in Nanjing, but the greatest efforts have been made, and they have already been clearly demonstrated. The best municipal administration is still praised by the general public as Vienna, the capital of Austria under the rule of the Social Democratic Party during the First European War. I believe that Nanjing is the capital of the new China of the Three Principles of the People, and it will definitely take care of the calls and demands of the public life, pay attention to production, save consumption, and seek the prosperity of the people's lives.

Commemorative Publication for the Return of the National Government to the Capital, Part 2

### Four Hours in the Sky Over Beijing and Chongqing

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Zhao Haosheng, Air Traffic Report from Nanjing

Chongqing! Wave goodbye to you, the sacred city of the eight-year Anti-Japanese War. Please bring a vigorous fighting spirit to Nanjing.

After the closing of the Political Participation Council, Chongqing was filled with calls for the return to the capital. The imminent convening of the National Assembly made the political "migratory birds" - the reporters - eager to rush to Nanjing. The Central Propaganda Department asked the China National Aviation Corporation to allocate a [missing text] to the reporters who had registered one after another. Under the circumstances that "we can leave in two or three days," preparations began on the 11th, until the 16th when we received the news that we were definitely leaving the next day.

We were really leaving Chongqing like this. Emotionally, I felt a little rushed, a little at a loss. Speaking of life in Chongqing, although it made people feel a little tired, the city that was closely connected with our eight years of suffering and fighting life was actually unspeakably heavy and reluctant to leave.

Everyone who leaves Chongqing to go to "the lower reaches of the Yangtze River" has considered the comparison of prices between the two places. Prices in the Beijing-Shanghai area are higher than in Chongqing, and it is best to buy some daily necessities in Chongqing. But another theory is that although prices in the Beijing-Shanghai area are expensive, the goods are better than those in Chongqing, so it is better to buy them "down there." For poor civil servants, the measure of value between a pair of leather shoes, a towel, and ten or twenty thousand yuan is also painstaking.

### Saying a Fond Farewell to the Glorious Land

To prepare luggage, to attend farewell dinners and say goodbyes, several days were spent busily. Actually, this parting wasn't too serious between friends, because everyone was leaving within the next ten days or a month. At the banquets, everyone raised their chopsticks and toasted, simply saying "See you in Nanjing!"

On the afternoon of the sixteenth, sending luggage to be weighed, one colleague actually wore five Western suits, three shirts, two coats, almost wearing five ties. Actually, the situation at the weighing station wasn't that serious because it was a large transport plane with a large load capacity. Beyond fifteen kilograms, a tolerance of one or two kilograms was allowed.

That day, passengers on a special plane from the Central Party Headquarters were also having their luggage weighed at the same time. I caught a ride back in their car. A woman in the car was holding a baby less than a year old. Because the weather was hot, the baby was completely naked, innocently smiling at the people in the car. Two clean, bright little teeth had already grown in that wide-open little mouth. This adorable baby made people unable to resist wanting to caress and tease him. The mother was very happy to introduce him to everyone, calling him "Xiao Yu." This was a name full of commemorative significance and immediately became the topic of conversation. The mother even let everyone look at the two little teeth in his mouth and pointed out, "His third tooth is already peeking out." Then someone said, "By the time he gets to Nanjing, the third tooth will have grown in." Everyone in the car laughed. "Xiao Yu's" third tooth represented the joy of so many people!

The night before departure, myself and my friends kept reminding each other to go to bed early, but the night before departure, as usual, it's not easy to fall asleep. After dinner, in order to inform a friend who was taking our car to the airport about the departure time, I lingered on Linsen Road for a long time. I cherished and paid close attention to every section of road I walked on. I almost wanted to touch every brick of the surrounding buildings. Tonight, even the most annoying high slopes became flat, and even the most disgusting sewage on the roadside became less irritating. Turning from Linsen Road onto Guofu Road, the stately hall of the National Government under the moonlight appeared magnificent and solemn. The lights under the high eaves were bright, and the giant pillars in front stood firm. This reminded me of the various "past events" during the Political Consultative Conference three months ago and the demonstrations on Daoli a month ago for the Northeast problem. Recollection is not a regressive emotion. Remembering these many changes and melting them with emotion will make you take life more seriously. When I took a detour to Shangqingsi on my way back to the newspaper office, it was almost eleven o'clock. The streets were very deserted. I walked slowly on the sidewalk, forcefully hitting the street with my leather shoes. A heavy echo came from afar. I wanted to quietly listen to the sounds of this mountain city one more time. I wanted to bid a final, fond farewell to this glorious land.

### Flying Over the Three Gorges, Overlooking the Panoramic View of the Lovely Shu River

The car had already taken us to the airport to wait. At half-past eleven, the plane came. Everyone hurriedly carried their luggage onto the plane. It was a C46 large transport plane. The forty-odd of us sat inside, very comfortably. There were no seats, so we sat on our luggage. The people from the company counted the number of people. Yesterday, a reporter from the "Business Daily" didn't arrive. At the time, someone who was sending his wife onto the plane temporarily filled in. Today, the "Business Daily" reporter came, and the gentleman who had temporarily filled in also got on the plane, so there was one extra person. The company wanted the gentleman who had temporarily filled in to get off. He pleaded, "Now that I'm already on, please be lenient!" Also, his wife and child needed him to take care of them. The company people refused. Finally, everyone unanimously asked him to consider the safety of the entire group. Only then did he get off. He said goodbye to his wife in a hurry. The child saw his father getting off and cried anxiously. The temporary separation of reunited couples is a common tragedy and comedy in the rear area. The wife being able to leave first was actually fortunate amidst misfortune.

The plane didn't start for a long time. The metal cabin was scorching hot from the blazing sun. The people sitting inside felt like they were in an oven. Some people, afraid of being cold at high altitude after takeoff, wore a lot of clothes, which made them sweat even more.

Finally, the engine started, but it circled once on the airport ground and then turned back. The plane door was reopened. The pilot said that there was a problem with the engine.

The engine was still being repaired at two o'clock. If we took off again, we would probably only be able to make it to Hankou to land. A colleague from Hubei was already preparing to get off at Hankou. Everyone was quite interested in the possibility of visiting Wuhan. At three o'clock, the repairs were completed. Before departure, the pilot announced that we would definitely be able to land in Nanjing.

Chiang Kai-shek

### Wu Tiecheng Expresses Sentiments on Returning to the Capital: Rebuilding the Old Land, Building a New China

When Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, visited this newspaper office on the afternoon of the thirtieth of last month, this reporter asked him for his thoughts on the National Government returning to the capital. Secretary-General Wu first said: "The victory of the War of Resistance and the return of the government to the capital are one of the most significant events in our country's history. The people of the whole country should also be joyfully encouraged, deeply celebrating the safety of our land. However, during the nation-building period from now on, we should still uphold the wartime spirit of the soldiers shedding blood and the people sweating, rebuilding the old land and building a new China. The determination of our party and government to seek peaceful unification and solidarity and to return the government to the people and implement constitutionalism is completely the same as the people's urgent desire." Secretary-General Wu then spoke about his feelings about leaving Chongqing, saying: "Having lived in Chongqing for eight years during the war, when I said goodbye yesterday morning, I witnessed the beautiful scenery of the Jialing River and the mountains, forests, and vegetation, and I couldn't help but feel nostalgic for the friendship of the people of Chongqing. What is especially unforgettable is that during the major air raids by enemy planes in Chongqing, the Chongqing citizens, police, firefighters, and the rescue teams participated in by our party comrades worked hard regardless of all dangers. At that time, we were fortunate to rely on the stonemasons who dug air-raid shelters day and night, working hard to reduce the losses of the people. Until shortly after the victory, we still seemed to be able to hear the shouts of the stonemasons, the sound of stone-cutting, and the sound of gunpowder explosions. Also, the workers in the factories near Chongqing and the farmers in Sichuan manufactured weapons in mountain caves or increased grain production in the fields during the war. Their contributions to the War of Resistance were extremely important. We also remember them very much. All these compatriots who worked hard in the War of Resistance are sufficient to represent the spirit of our nation's ancestors pioneering and forging ahead. Based on this spirit, we believe that the task of promoting the peaceful unification and solidarity of our country and building a new China will definitely be successful. We should especially have this confidence and perseverance."

The worries caused by leaving Chongqing were dispelled by the pleasant sound of the engine. The plane soared into the sky, bringing people back into the emotion of farewell. The plane was traveling in the clear sky, and everyone was leaning against the windows to bid a final farewell to Chongqing.

That winding and shining thing in the mountains is the Jialing River. That which is always appearing and disappearing under the plane is the Yangtze River. The highway is like a long golden, endless ribbon. The mountain caves, Qingmuguan, and Beipei look like small black dots. "Look! Look!" A mother sitting next to me dragged her child to the window and pointed, "There, in the distance, is Chongqing. Wave to her! Say goodbye to her!" The child's big eyes were illuminated by the sunlight shining through the window, making them even brighter. The dark little pupils were moving extremely quickly. He excitedly looked down, waving his small hand and shouting in response to his mother's call, "Bye! Bye!"

This time, it was a real farewell to Chongqing. Chongqing, she buried so many unforgettable memories for people. Chongqing, it is a place that has been connected to us by flesh and blood for eight years. Eight years, more than two thousand nine hundred days! I, a small life, was born here, and many children grew up here. Many relatives who should not have died died here. So much sweetness and bitterness that had never been experienced before was experienced here. Chongqing, every Chinese person will remember you forever, and will forever miss you, Chongqing! You will always be brilliant in the memories of millions of people, Chongqing! You will be as immortal as China's victorious War of Resistance!

Emotions were rolling with the sound of the engine, drifting with the flowing clouds in the sky, slowly congealing into an indistinguishable blur, slowly being blown farther and farther away by the clear, cold wind.

The plane was traveling extremely smoothly. In the cabin, some were eating oranges, some were reading, and some were lying on their luggage, pretending to sleep. The reporter and a friend leaned against the window, waiting to see the plane pass over the Three Gorges.

Calculating the time, it should be reaching the skies above the Three Gorges. The airflow began to change, and the plane shook slightly. Looking down at the plane's wings, there was a vast expanse of even larger overlapping mountains. The Yangtze River rolled into the mountains, and could not be seen at all. The so-called Twelve Peaks of Wushan are probably those stacked mountain peaks shaped like steamed buns below! The plane flying over the Three Gorges made people not feel the "desolate and gloomy atmosphere of Wushan and Wuxia," and could not see the poetic scene of "a solitary city on the river, the setting sun slanting." The progress of science has also expanded people's scope of appreciation of nature. If Du Fu were alive, his "Eight Autumn Meditations" could also be rewritten, adding some new content.

From the time it flew above the ground, within the Three Gorges, there were extremely regular mountain ranges accompanied by the Yangtze River. The scenery of "the waters of the Shu River are green, and the mountains of Shu are green" can also be roughly appreciated on the plane. Outside the Three Gorges, looking east along the Yangtze River, there is a vast plain. Here, the Yangtze River seems to have broken free from the shackles of the Three Gorges, winding happily on the plain. In addition to the Yangtze River, there are also more intersecting rivers and large lakes here. The entire terrain outside the Three Gorges is open and elegant, like the face of an oriental beauty with gentle curves and light makeup, unlike the overlapping mountains of the Sichuan terrain, like the high nose and protruding forehead of a Westerner.

Taking off at 3:15, when we arrived near Wuhan, the sun was already setting. The shadows of night slowly flew into the plane from outside the window. The lights in the cabin were turned on. The plane began to fly at night. The engine was humming evenly and regularly. It was still traveling very smoothly in the night sky.

At 7:20, the door of the cockpit in front opened. A radio operator came out and passed a slip of paper to everyone to read: "Arriving in Nanjing in thirty minutes. Remain seated during landing." At this time, moonlight shone in from the plane window. Looking out the window, the moon was clear and bright. The plane seemed to be gliding in a milky white sea, truly having a feeling of "clearness inside and out." Occasionally, we could still see a little light from the burning of mountain wildfires. Twenty minutes later, someone shouted that the lights of Nanjing were in sight.

### The Plane Quietly Landed, Seeing the Standing, Luminous Figure

Like a pattern adorned with pearls, like many stars plucked from the sky and planted on the ground, electric lights formed a square chessboard-like thing. In the middle were lines woven from red lights, imagining that should be a series of streets. The plane circled in the sky, and the pearl-adorned pattern spun around. The plane descended layer by layer like going down stairs. The pattern became brighter and brighter, and larger and larger. When it was close to the airport in the sky, the wings of the plane were emitting radio signals, and the lights on the left and right of the engine were also turned on. In a way that people did not feel, it had already landed on the ground.

The first person to open the cabin door after the plane stopped was a porter wearing a numbered uniform. He greeted us with a Nanjing accent. Looking at his watch, it was exactly 7:50. Four hours and thirty-five minutes from Chongqing. Hearing the sounds of Nanjing!

Carrying my luggage, I came out and looked around on the escalator. It was a boundless expanse of blue. While I was at a loss, I suddenly heard a familiar voice shouting, "Zhao Da!" I walked down, stepped on the land of Nanjing, and shook a friend's hand. I was so happy that I wanted to hug my friend and jump up. I was so excited that I really wanted to bend down and kiss the land of this capital!

It was still the old Zhu speaking that incomprehensible Zhejiang dialect, telling me that he had been waiting at the airport for eight hours. I got into the car he had driven and drove towards the city. The road was unimaginably bad. From Dajiaochang into Zhonghuamen, to Zhonghua Road, I watched every single thing I could see. There were not many pedestrians on the street. Many shops had already closed. From Zhonghua Road to Road, the situation was the same. When we got to Zhongshan Road, we had already entered the city center area. The scene was still deserted. When the car passed the statue of the Father of the Nation in the central square at the intersection of Streets, Old Zhu told me that when President Chiang triumphedantly returned to Nanjing, he had gotten out of the car here to pay his respects to the statue. That night, I saw that standing, luminous figure in the darkness, feeling an extremely solemn emotion rising in my heart. As the car passed her, I cheered in my heart to this statue symbolizing infinite sublime glory!

Based on the city and the many places I saw, the feeling that Nanjing gave me was exceptionally desolate. The large city made people feel an emptiness that . Tonight I am writing at my desk, praying in my heart that the people abandon all that is bad, and bring to Nanjing the combatant, thriving spirit cultivated in Chongqing for eight years! (May 2nd)

### The Return of the National Government to the Capital and China's New Birth

— Xie Yunyi

After eight years of long-term resistance, Chairman Chiang and the National Government, who led this nation's historical war, have now triumphantly returned to the capital. What a meaningful grand event this is in the history of the Chinese nation! Eight years ago, the arrogance of the Japanese invaders in East Asia was at its peak, and they were intensifying their aggression against us step by step, attempting to eliminate our nation's survival, to conquer China and achieve "Greater East Asia Co-prosperity," and "Eight Corners of the World Under One Roof," in order to rule the entire world. We raised the banner of resistance with a backward industrial production and poorly equipped military, and how difficult our situation was at that time. Domestically, there was no heavy industry base to support long-term warfare, transportation was inconvenient, military transport was difficult, and social organization was loose. Internationally, although the great powers expressed sympathy, their supply of military fire and resources to Japan was as if the war did not exist, or they proclaimed to uphold justice while secretly colluding with the enemy. All of these were unfavorable to our independent resistance. However, we independently resisted the Japanese invaders for as long as four years. Only when the Japanese invaders were trapped deeper and deeper in the mire of China did the attack on Pearl Harbor and the outbreak of the Pacific War occur. This allowed us to wait for the Allied nations, from our country's independent resistance to the United Nations' joint resistance. Now, the Japanese invaders have surrendered and submitted, and the leader and government that led our national struggle have returned to Nanjing amidst the sound of triumph. This is truly a great event that should be recorded in detail in the history of the Chinese nation. As Chairman Chiang's announcement says, this Sino-Japanese war was a total competition of national power between the two nations. In this historical struggle, Japan failed, and China has returned to its rightful position in East Asia. The one who overcame all kinds of difficulties with firm will and ultimately enabled us to achieve victory is our great leader, the wise Chairman Chiang, who seems to be the savior of our nation. Now that the National Government has triumphantly returned to Nanjing, we must first express our infinite respect for Chairman Chiang, who led us to victory. Regarding the soldiers and civilians who died in this national struggle, remembering the intensity of their deaths, we also sincerely express our respect. It is because of their deaths that we have our lives.

This Sino-Japanese War has liquidated Japan's aggression against us for the past fifty years, and restored our country's leading position in East Asia. China was originally the only great power leading East Asia. After the Japanese Restoration, it actively expanded its national power, and in the Jiawu War, our country's leading position in East Asia began to waver. After the Russo-Japanese War, Japan became the leader of East Asia, joining the ranks of the great powers. This was an invasion of us, with steps intensifying. After the Xinhai Revolution, Japan, seeing that a strong and unified China conflicted with its attempt to rule and conquer China, did its best to carry out a movement to divide China, colluding with warlord separatist forces in an attempt to prevent China's strong unification. The progress of the National Revolution encountered many setbacks because of Japan's obstruction. Japan was an obstacle to the completion of our National Revolution, because the purpose of the National Revolution was to establish a strong and unified China, which conflicted with Japan's intentions. Therefore, when the armed forces of the National Revolution settled in the Jiangnan Yangtze River basin and headed north to North China, there was the so-called "Jinan Incident." At the time of the Northeastern Flag Replacement and national unification, there was the "Shenyang Incident" and the establishment of "Manchukuo." All of these actions were contrary to the wishes of the Chinese people. In order to complete the National Revolution and implement the construction of the Three Principles of the People, China had to stop Japan's aggression. In order to ensure its leading position in East Asia and to realize its dream of "Eight Corners of the World Under One Roof," Japan had to conquer China. The Sino-Japanese relationship in the past fifty years is actually a history of Japan's aggression against China. The total competition between the two nations was manifested in this Sino-Japanese War. Due to the victory of the Resistance War, China wiped out the shame of the past fifty years and restored its past glory.

Now, this historically significant national struggle has ended gloriously. From now on, we will embark on the road of national construction, and China will begin to have its new birth. There are many aspects to national construction, such as material construction and psychological construction. Under material construction, there can also be transportation construction and production construction. However, the most important thing in national construction is to build people. The new birth of the nation must be based on the new birth of the people. The nation is originally a collection of countless people, countless individuals. To build a nation without first building up individuals with a new birth is like building a high-rise building on the beach, without a solid foundation. Only when individuals have a new birth can the nation have a new birth, and national construction can have a solid foundation. Therefore, when Chairman Chiang discussed national construction in his book "China's Destiny," he first mentioned ethical construction and psychological construction. We must have a new spiritual life in order to enjoy a new material life. At the present time when the nation is entering the stage of national construction, individual construction cannot be ignored. Although we have won this Resistance War, in this war, the general national morality of our country has deteriorated greatly. This is manifested in all aspects of life: the decline of private life, the competition for hypocrisy, deception, and plunder becoming a common practice, and the repeated occurrence of corruption cases, which have recently become more severe, from secretly taking and plundering to openly swindling and robbing. All of these show the bankruptcy of national morality. In response to the current malpractices, Chairman Chiang loudly called for the promotion of the New Life Movement, urging the people to know etiquette, justice, integrity, and shame, and to distinguish right from wrong. However, what has been the result in the past ten years? Which one of us should not feel ashamed towards Chairman Chiang? With this low level of morality, how can we truly complete the great cause of national construction? Facing the historical stage of national construction, all of our people should truly know justice and be clear about integrity and shame, and "knowing" and "being clear" are not enough; we must practice it personally, reform our faces and wash our hearts, each of us determined that the "old self" has already died yesterday, and the "new self" is born today, thoroughly reforming our words and deeds, and each of us has a new awakening of personal self, then the new birth of the Chinese nation can have hope.

The reason for the decline of national morality is not simple, and the main reason is the abandonment of traditional values and the failure to cherish them. Although the Xinhai Revolution overthrew the imperial rule of thousands of years, it was not the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the national ideological traditions of our country for thousands of years, but the so-called May Fourth Movement after the Xinhai Revolution. Under the slogan of "Down with the Confucius Family Store," our inherent traditions, especially our inherent ethical traditions, were despised. As the trend developed thereafter, ethical values lost their standards, and personal behavior was no longer subject to social sanctions. When the war broke out, the difficulties of wartime life led to a further decline in moral standards, and recently, it has become even worse. For the sake of national construction, we must stop this downward trend. Although we are called one of the five great powers, our material production capacity is not as good as others, and we should catch up. But as a land of etiquette and righteousness with a cultural history of five thousand years, if national morality continues to decline without thinking of revitalizing, how can we face those "barbaric lands" that we despise? In the great cause of national construction, we should catch up in material construction, and we should also pay attention to psychological construction and ethical construction. We must re-establish moral standards, so that social order can be maintained, and national construction efforts will not be wasted.

Let us take a look at Britain and the United States, which have reached an advanced level in material construction, and how much they value spiritual and moral life. Zhu Jiaxiang, a special correspondent of Zhongbao stationed in New York, said in his communication: "The material life of the United States can be said to have reached its peak. Especially in this world's largest city, the extravagance and luxury are unparalleled in the world. More than seven million residents are influenced by what they see and hear. The temptation of sensuality and the pursuit of material things are undoubtedly intense. But in this environment where money is omnipotent and material things are prosperous, strangely, they still pay attention to spiritual life, they still pursue religious comfort. When material things are satisfied, they do not forget the spirit. Although they have material life, they do not despise spiritual life, and this is closely related to the maintenance and development of their country and society." He also said: "Now we have to ask again, what role do their religious beliefs play in their worldly human hearts? This question is of course not easy to answer... But according to the comments of most church people and impartial people, if this country has no religious beliefs, then human desires will be rampant. Now there are these unique social education and training institutions (…holding high the torch of morality, acting as a pillar in the middle stream, the moral standards of this country are thus actively maintained. For example, in terms of social atmosphere, although the relationship between men and women is casual, there is still public opinion supervision controlled by the church; it is very difficult for a person to do something if they have a moral defect. …In fact, this religious force is still the backbone of the moral force of this country. They usually speak in a completely democratic and free way based on their religious beliefs, leading the masses and influencing people's hearts, directly influencing the country's policies, and therefore their impact is significant. At this time of chaos in the world, the United States has defeated the enemy with its strong material strength, and now it still wants to have compassion and save the world, and to vigorously establish justice. We cannot deny that this great moral force is mainly due to religion."

Looking back at the situation in China, what is it like? We despise and do not cherish our traditional moral laws. We do not learn and adopt the religious beliefs and religious life of Americans, in other words, the spiritual life of Americans. Our material production capacity is far inferior to that of the United States, but our people want to imitate Americans in everything in their enjoyment of material life. The result of the interaction of these factors is the gradual decline of national morality. The great cause of national construction emphasizes both material and spiritual things. We cannot pay attention to material construction and ignore spiritual construction. The most important thing in spiritual construction is the complete renewal of individuals; only with the new birth of individuals can there be the new birth of the nation.

### A Review of the National Government's Move to the Capital

— This Newspaper's Data Room

After the "August 13th" Incident in the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), the heroic soldiers who defended Shanghai fought bloody battles for more than three months. Finally, due to strategic reasons, they retreated from the vicinity of Shanghai. From that time on, the enemy, with a cruel and brutal attitude, pressed towards our capital step by step. Soon, the flames of war spread to the outskirts of the capital. However, our government authorities had long been determined to resist to the end. Therefore, from mid-November, the ministries and departments of the National Government had begun to prepare for internal relocation. For the convenience of administration, all five Yuan of the National Government moved to Chongqing, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Health Department moved to Hankou, the Ministry of Transportation moved to Changsha, and the military agencies remained in Nanjing.

On November 20, the National Government formally issued a declaration of moving to Chongqing. This is a document of great significance. The full text is reproduced below:

"Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, Tianjin and Beiping have fallen, and the war has spread. The National Government, in view of the endless aggression of the violent Japanese, has decided to resist and defend ourselves. The people of the whole country share the same hatred of the enemy, and all officers and soldiers are loyal and courageous. In the provinces that have been invaded, there have been extremely rapid struggles and extremely heroic sacrifices. In the corner of Shanghai, the resistance war has lasted for three months. Officers and soldiers from all over the country have rushed to the rescue when they heard the call, arriving in the evening when ordered in the morning. They have built trenches with their flesh and blood on the front line, and there is no retreat in death. The violent Japanese have used the power of their naval, land, and air forces to launch continuous attacks. Although the positions have turned to ashes, the morale of the army is as firm as gold and stone. Their courage in the face of battle and the intensity of their deaths are enough to show the spirit of national independence and lay the foundation for the rejuvenation of China. Recently, the violent Japanese have become even more greedy and unscrupulous, sending troops westward to force our capital. Their intention is nothing more than to use their violence to force us into a covenant under the city. However, it is not known that since our country decided to resist and defend ourselves, we have deeply known that this is the last moment. For the sake of the country's life, for the sake of national personality, for the sake of international justice and world peace, there is no room for surrender. All those with blood and qi are determined to rather be a broken piece of jade than a whole tile. The National Government has moved to Chongqing today in order to adapt to the war situation, coordinate the overall situation, and carry out long-term resistance. From now on, we will engage in a more lasting battle on the largest scale. With the multitude of the Chinese people and the breadth of the land, everyone is determined to die, and their blood and land are condensed into one, and no violence can separate them; with the sympathy of the international community and the unity of the people, continuing the resistance war will surely achieve the goal of maintaining the survival and independence of the nation and the country. This is hereby declared, and we encourage each other! November 20, the 26th year of the Republic of China."

Five days after the declaration of the National Government's move to the capital was issued, Chairman Chiang made an important speech, the main points of which were as follows:

"We firmly believe that justice will eventually triumph over power, and we will resist to the end to the last inch of land and the last person. This is our fixed policy. China intends to maintain its policy of resolute resistance. We will defend Nanjing, but we will do so from afar. The lives and property of foreigners should be protected. The rumor that Nanjing will be set on fire if it is in danger of falling into enemy hands is just a rumor."

In fact, when the declaration of moving the capital was issued, the government agencies had almost finished moving. All files and documents were safely moved out; all valuable equipment in the offices and factories was completely dismantled; hospitals, equipment, factory lathes, and various machines were all moved away. The city of Nanjing was left with only an empty shell. The public's mood was quite calm, with no signs of chaos or panic. The citizens were determined to resist to the end.

From the end of November, the heads of various government ministries, such as Yu Youren, Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Kong Xiangxi, Wei Daoming, Duan Xipeng, Huang Jilu, Dai Chuanxian, and Ju Zheng, left Beijing one after another, took boats to Hankou, and stayed there temporarily. Chairman Lin took the Yong Sui warship through Yichang on the 22nd and arrived in Chongqing on the 26th. At that time, the people of Chongqing held a grand welcome meeting. Chairman Chiang remained in Nanjing, commanding calmly.

After the National Government moved to Chongqing, the ambassadors of various countries held a meeting to discuss the location of the embassies. As a result, it was decided to move to Hankou temporarily. Each embassy left a part of its staff in Nanjing to form an international committee to preside over the protection of foreigners. As a result, envoys from Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union arrived in Hankou one after another and continued to work in their respective consulates.

Zhang Qun, Secretary-General of the Military Affairs Commission, after the National Government moved west, hosted foreign residents and foreign reporters stationed in Beijing and announced that Nanjing would still be the capital of China. Civil affairs would be handled by Mayor Ma Chaojun, and Zhang would be responsible for maintaining law and order, and would do his best to protect the lives and property of foreigners.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance began to work in Hankou on the 26th. At the same time, the ministries and departments of the National Government decided to send one-fifth of their personnel to Sichuan. More than 500 personnel from the civil affairs, military affairs, and accounting offices arrived in Chongqing at the end of November. The agencies that moved to Chongqing began to work on December 1. At this point, the important western town of our country officially became the wartime capital.

However, at that time, the government's civil administration organization had actually been eliminated and replaced by a military administration organization. Chairman Chiang's headquarters was formed here. The number of personnel in the various Yuan and ministries has been reduced to a minimum. For the convenience of communication, the government agencies, in addition to staying in Hankou for temporary office work, also established offices in Guangdong Province. However, the military center had moved to Hunan Province, because there were railways and highways connecting Hankou, Nanchang, and the four provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou. Therefore, Hunan Province had become the base for our country's long-term resistance.

In late December, the flames of war spread westward, and Hankou was actively preparing for war. The government agencies stationed in Hankou continued to move inland when necessary. The temporary offices of the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry moved to Chongqing, while the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Ministry of Education moved to Changsha temporarily, and soon moved to Chongqing as well.

The National Government's move to Chongqing, which occupies an important page in the history of China's resistance against Japan, has now been completed.

### Record of the Triumphant Return to Nanjing: A New Page for the National Government's Return to the Capital

— By the Newspaper's Data Room

With the atomic bomb falling on Hiroshima, Japan, the Soviet Union's entry into the war on August 9, and China's heroic resistance, the Japanese Emperor finally announced Japan's unconditional surrender on August 15. When the news of the victory against Japan reached the ears of the officials and civilians of the wartime capital who had been in exile for eight years, waves of longing to return home surged in everyone's hearts, and the entire city of Chongqing was plunged into a frenzy of preparations for repatriation.

On the third day after the Japanese invaders surrendered, the Central News Agency first issued a statement from the Chinese government spokesperson to the press corps revealing that the National Government was planning to return to Nanjing in the shortest possible time. In mid-September, the authorities ordered all agencies to prepare for the return to the capital. In early December, the Executive Yuan specially dispatched Councilor Chen to Nanjing to survey the offices, furniture, and accommodations of the various ministries and commissions after their personnel arrived in the capital. As a result of this trip, it was decided that the Executive Yuan would temporarily use the old Ministry of Railways office building, and most of the ministries and commissions would continue to work at their original sites.

At the same time, in accordance with the instructions of the highest authorities, the Executive Yuan determined the specific measures for the government personnel's return to the capital: (1) The Executive Yuan and its affiliated ministries and commissions would dispatch a portion of their personnel to Beijing according to actual needs. The number of personnel for each ministry and commission would vary, with the most, such as the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Transportation, having 150 people, and the least, such as the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, having only 10 people, for a total of 1,500 people. (2) All personnel were required to arrive in Nanjing before December 15. (3) The Executive Yuan's regular meetings would be moved to Nanjing.

Starting on December 5, the government agencies' personnel returning to the capital began to bid farewell to China's wartime capital and embark on their triumphant return journey, returning to the capital they had been away from for eight years. They set off by land, water, and air. The air routes between Chongqing and Nanjing-Shanghai suspended passenger transport for ten days in order to rush the first batch of personnel returning to the capital. The first batch of returning personnel (including personnel from the Executive Yuan agencies), 150 people, first flew to Nanjing on the 12th. Sixty employees of the Ministry of Judicial Administration arrived in Nanjing on the 13th. In addition, the first batch of 400 personnel from the Executive Yuan traveled along the Yangtze River on the Huayuan transport ship, directly to the capital. Sixty employees of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs traveled to Beijing by plane and ship on the 14th. The first batch of personnel from the Executive Yuan agencies had all arrived by the 15th and officially began work on the 17th. More than 60 personnel from the Ministry of Education arrived in Beijing around the 20th. After that, government agencies' personnel continued to leave Chongqing for Beijing, and for a time, the roads between Beijing and Chongqing were filled with officials, brimming with vigor. By early February, the number of personnel who had returned to the capital had reached more than 1,000.

However, according to estimates from relevant parties, the number of public servants and their families belonging to the central agencies remaining in Chongqing who should return to the capital with the government often exceeded 430,000. As a result, the return to the capital faced two major difficulties: first, transportation was difficult, and the capacity of land, water, and air transport could not meet actual needs. According to reports from transportation authorities, the transportation volume in March, across all routes nationwide, was 10,000 people by air, of which approximately 4,500 people arrived in Shanghai and Nanjing. Land routes were divided into north and south lines, with the south line reaching Changsha and the north line reaching Baoji, before transferring to Beijing, with a capacity of 20,000 passengers. Water transport was unable to directly reach Hankou, so 8,400 people were transported in the Yichang-Chongqing section. At this rate, it would take a year to transport 400,000 people. In addition to strengthening air transport capacity, the authorities had to restrict the allocation of flight seats, and it was decided to prioritize air transport for approximately 1,000 representatives of the National Assembly and councilors, as well as 4,200 personnel from central party and government agencies. The flight seat allocation was as follows: 500 people from the Central Party Headquarters, 100 people from the Supreme National Defense Council, 280 people from the Office of the President's Civil Affairs and Accounting Office, 120 people from the Office of the President's Military Affairs, 200 people from the Youth League, 600 people from the Legislative Yuan, 120 people from the Judicial Yuan, 250 people from the Examination Yuan, 120 people from the Control Yuan, 1,700 people from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Economy, Transportation, Agriculture and Forestry, and Food, as well as personnel from diplomatic missions. Other ordinary personnel returning to the capital would inevitably be slightly restricted.

The second difficulty in returning to the capital was the housing problem for the returning personnel. According to rough estimates, there was a shortage of approximately 28,000 buildings for government agencies' office buildings and residences for public servants' families in Nanjing. To remedy this, the government has ordered the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to allocate 7 billion yuan for the construction of houses. In addition, the government has ordered 1,700 prefabricated houses from the United States. Before the prefabricated houses were fully delivered, each agency was responsible for its own office buildings in Beijing, and employees' families would temporarily remain in Chongqing. If they needed to go to Beijing first, they would be responsible for finding their own housing.

In late February, the Supreme National Defense Council passed the "Measures for the Return of Central Party and Government Agencies from Chongqing to the Capital," the main points of which were as follows:

(A) Regulations for personnel returning to the capital from government agencies: (1) The number of employees is limited to those currently employed and cannot exceed the number budgeted for this year. (2) Employees' dependents are limited to spouses and direct relatives. (3) On average, each employee can bring three dependents, and each worker can bring one dependent. (4) For civil servants of each agency who died in Chongqing, if their dependents have not taken a position in other agencies and need to return to the capital, the original agency will handle the return procedures.

(B) Regulations for public property: Each agency will handle its own public property, limited to 100 kilograms per employee.

(C) Regulations for employees' luggage: Each employee and their dependents are allowed 100 kilograms, and each worker and their dependents are allowed 50 kilograms.

(D) Budgetary estimates: (1) The cost of transportation for personnel traveling from Chongqing to Beijing, including loading and unloading at wharves and transportation along the way, will be calculated based on actual expenses and handled by each agency. (2) The cost of ship tickets and meals is estimated at an average of 120,000 yuan per person. (3) 20,000 yuan per 100 kilograms. (4) The cost of transporting public and private property from Chongqing to Beijing, including all expenses, is estimated at 150,000 yuan per ton. (5) The cost of purchasing equipment for each agency after returning to the capital is estimated at 100,000 yuan per employee and 30,000 yuan per worker.

(E) Regulations for subsidies for employees returning to the capital: (1) 400,000 yuan for each special grade, 350,000 yuan for each senior grade, 300,000 yuan for each recommended grade, 250,000 yuan for each appointed grade, and 150,000 yuan for each employee. 80,000 yuan for each worker. Agencies that do not return to the capital with employees and workers will be given three months' severance pay.

(F) Central agencies outside of Chongqing that move back to the capital, and central agencies that move from Chongqing to other locations outside of the capital, will be handled in accordance with these regulations.

At this point, the National Government's return to the capital entered the stage of concrete realization.

### The Peak of the Return to the Capital

Strictly speaking, the practical stage of the National Government's return to the capital began on April 25. Most of the Executive Yuan's staff had arrived in Nanjing, and two-thirds of the number of personnel returning to the capital from the various departments and agencies of the Yuan had arrived and had begun working in Beijing.

Since Japan's surrender in August, the offices of the Yuan's departments and committees in Beijing had only been for receiving and dispatching correspondence. But by April 25, it had completely changed and become the nerve center of the military and political administration. Not only were government officials intensifying their air travel to return to the capital, but leaders of various parties were also preparing to come to Beijing.

The National Government building was brilliantly restored and renovated. The National Government's construction project was divided into three parts: the first part, the office building, including the President's office and the Civil Affairs Office, would be completed immediately. The second part, the library building, including the office of the Disciplinary Committee for Political Officials, the library, and the third part, the printing bureau and printing factory, would be completed by the end of April. The National Government's site had been occupied by the puppet Reformed Government, the puppet Executive Yuan, the puppet Control Yuan, the puppet Legislative Yuan, the puppet Examination Yuan, and the puppet Ministry of Personnel during the occupation. One of the dining halls had been destroyed by fire, and the entire building had not been repaired for eight years, resulting in weeds growing on the roof and leaks whenever it rained. Now, the renovation is gradually restoring it to its former appearance (Note: The organization of the National Government: the Civil Affairs Office, under which are the Bureau of Political Affairs (added in early October last year), the Printing Bureau, the Document Bureau, and the Personnel Office. The Military Affairs Office, under which is the Bureau of Military Affairs (added in early October last year). The General Affairs Bureau and the Bureau of Ceremonies. The Accounting Office, under which are the Accounting Bureau, the Statistics Bureau, and the Budget Bureau, as well as two independent directly affiliated organizations: the Political Officials Disciplinary Committee and the Audit Committee).

The work of returning to the capital becomes more urgent every day. By around April 20, an average of half of the government officials had already gone to Beijing. The Executive Yuan began working on the 25th, and the other agencies began working on the 28th.

One of the most inspiring pieces of news amidst the hurried return to the capital was that President Chiang, who led the nation in the heroic resistance against Japan, would soon return in glory to the capital to preside over the return to the capital. The people of the wartime capital felt deeply attached to President Chiang's leadership in the war of resistance, which led to the final victory, and his care for the citizens over the past eight years. Therefore, people from all walks of life initiated an unprecedented grand farewell meeting to express their solemn farewell and to ask President Chiang to give a speech to the citizens as a permanent memento. At the same time, the municipal government is planning to open a grand park from Zizui in Chaotianmen to the Minsheng Company area, with a bronze statue of President Chiang erected inside to commemorate President Chiang's great achievements in leading the national resistance against Japan in Chongqing.

On April 30, the National Government promulgated the Order for the Return to the Capital as follows:

"The National Government moved the capital to Chongqing in November of the 26th year [1937] in order to wage a prolonged war of resistance. For eight years, thanks to the loyal and brave soldiers who followed each other's footsteps and sacrificed heroically, the officials and civilians of the whole country endured hardships, struggled tenaciously, and fought alongside the Allied countries at sea and in the air, which eventually led to the surrender of the enemy and the completion of the long-cherished goal. Now that the national territory has been recovered and the country is complete, the responsibility of resisting the war is over, but the responsibility of building the country is heavier. The government has decided to triumphantly return to Nanjing on May 5 of this year to comfort the public's wishes. However, after the great war, the people's livelihood is difficult and the national strength is declining, so it is necessary to allow the people to rest and recover, strive for construction, and maintain the fruits of the war. It is hoped that the soldiers and civilians of the whole country will be of one heart and one mind and work diligently, so that they will not betray the original intention of resisting the war and building the country and realize the mission of the Three People's Principles. Recalling these eight years, the enemy has penetrated deeply and suffered heavy losses. If it were not for relying on the vast people of western China and relying on their fertile land, how could we have laid the foundation for today's victory? Sichuan, known as the Land of Abundance in ancient times, is the source of national power. Chongqing, with its two rivers, controls the north and south, and occupies a strategic position. Therefore, it was able to survive the crisis and achieve victory. Its great contribution to the country will be eternally recorded in history and will never be erased. As we approach the return to the capital and look forward to Nanjing, we realize the importance of the relationship between Sichuan and Chongqing. The government issued an order in September of the 29th year [1940] to designate Chongqing as the wartime capital, and recently designated Sichuan as the national construction experiment zone. The government should adopt its system and promote its reputation and reality. The Executive Yuan should supervise the provincial and municipal governments to plan and implement actively, so that Sichuan will forever be the center of the country and a model for national construction. This is our hope. This order."

At the same time as the National Government promulgated the "Order for the Return to the Capital," Special Envoy Marshall departed for Beijing on a special plane. Special Envoy Marshall kept a low profile in Beijing and discussed various intelligence reports with his staff. CCP representative Zhou Enlai and others were scheduled to come to Beijing on the 3rd. Accompanying staff and telecommunications personnel arrived on the afternoon of the 2nd to arrange everything. Representatives of the Democratic League may come to Beijing on the 5th and have already sent people to Beijing to look for office and residential buildings. Although Marshal Marshall expressed regret that the negotiations in Chongqing did not yield results, he was still confident in overcoming the difficulties ahead.

Today, the officials and civilians of the whole country celebrate the grand ceremony of returning to the capital after the victory of the War of Resistance with enthusiastic feelings of triumph—the founding ceremony of a new China of peace, unification, democracy, strength and prosperity. (Xintang)

The capital's various sectors are rushing to build ceremonial archways to celebrate the National Government's return to the capital.

### An Anecdote About the Return to the Capital

— By the Newspaper's Data Room

With the victory of the War of Resistance, the issue of returning to the capital was immediately noticed by people and regarded as one of the preconditions for the development of national construction work in the future. By December of last year, the air in the wartime capital and Beiping was filled with talk of returning the capital to Beiping. In fact, it was not just talk, but there were several facts that could be used to support it:

(1) On December 15 of last year, the Central News Agency reported that the Beiping Chamber of Commerce Rectification Committee had submitted a request to President Chiang to move the capital to Beiping.

(2) Huaibei Envoy Zhang Ji advocated building the capital in Beiping at a reception for journalists and hoped that the press would promote it more.

(3) According to a Chongqing dispatch from the Associated Press on December 20 of last year, government leaders recently held an informal vote, and the results showed that 92 percent of them favored building the capital in Beiping, and the national sentiment in favor of building the capital in Beiping was also very enthusiastic.

(4) According to a certain military and political official in Nanjing, after President Chiang inspected the recovered areas and returned to Chongqing, he had a very good impression of Beiping, and Allied personnel were particularly interested in the area. If Special Envoy Marshall's mediation of the CCP and KMT disputes was successful, the domestic problems could be solved. If so, then building the capital in Beiping might be realized soon.

(5) On April 1 of this year, at the 19th meeting of the National Political Council, Councilors He Jihong, Wang Puhan, and others requested the government to issue an order to establish the capital in Beiping. The resolution was passed and sent to the government for adoption and implementation.

(6) Beiping Mayor Xiong Bin once told reporters informally that Beiping had a 70 percent chance of becoming China's future capital.

(7) At the same time, the United States was also deeply interested in China moving its political center to Beiping. They felt that after the completion of the new port built by the Japanese in Tianjin, the situation of Beijing and Tianjin for China was very similar to that of Washington and New York for the United States.

Under these expectations and promotions, the atmosphere of establishing the capital in Beiping gradually became stronger and seemed to be a real possibility. However, we have never heard the government officially announce anything about this matter. On the contrary, government spokesman Zhang Pingqun told reporters that the rumors that the government was now considering building the capital in Beiping were not true. At the same time, Propaganda Minister Wu Guozhen also replied to foreign reporters' questions, saying that the capital of our country is still Nanjing, and we have not heard of the current consideration of establishing Beiping as the capital.

After that, the situation in the Northeast became increasingly urgent, and the talk of moving the capital to Beiping, which had been widely publicized for a while, subsided. At the same time, after the government decided to return to Nanjing, it made every effort to strengthen preparations for the return to the capital, using facts to prove the unreliability of the past "moving the capital to Beiping" theory. This can only be said to be an interlude in the National Government's return to the capital.
