### Chairman Respects the Spirit of Democracy: Summoned Representatives of the Kuomintang and the Democratic Socialist Party to Inquire About Opinions on Revising the Draft Constitution

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The 18th Presidium Meeting will be held on the morning of the 16th. At 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 16th, the 3rd Comprehensive Review Committee Meeting on the Draft Constitution will be held to continue discussing the organization and powers of the National Assembly.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The Presidium of the National Assembly held its 17th meeting at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 15th. Chairman Zhu Jiahua listened to reports from the conveners of the various review committees and the comprehensive committee regarding the review process of each group. Since the review work of the comprehensive committee had not yet been completed, it was decided that the general assembly would be postponed until the 18th. During the meeting, there was also discussion about whether the general assembly should be further postponed, as the constitutional amendment work may take some time to complete. It is expected that this issue may be raised for discussion at the general assembly on the 18th. Rumors suggest that the general assembly will be postponed again until the 25th before it can conclude.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Chairman Chiang summoned Kuomintang representatives Lei Zhen and others at 7:00 PM on the afternoon of the 15th to inquire about the draft constitution and instructed them to uphold the spirit of democracy and pass the draft constitution after consultation.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] As the review of the draft constitution proceeds, Chairman Chiang, in order to respect the spirit of democracy, frequently discusses the matter with figures from the Kuomintang and the Democratic Socialist Party. At 8:00 PM on the afternoon of the 12th, he specifically summoned Xu Fulin of the Democratic Socialist Party to inquire about their attitude towards the draft constitution. Moreover, at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 15th, Xu Fulin and Jiang Yuntian visited Sun Ke at his residence to further exchange opinions on the draft constitution. According to a certain member of the Democratic Socialist Party, the chairman and his senior cadres are sincerely abiding by the spirit of consultation. A certain member of the Democratic Socialist Party stated: The reasons for our party's participation in the National Assembly are to (1) pass the draft constitution, (2) improve politics, and (3) end one-party rule and achieve national peace. If the principles of the draft constitution are changed, it would be tantamount to cutting off the road to peace. If peace talks succeed in the future, wouldn't this amended constitution have to be completely overturned again? Therefore, we do not believe that all parties must express satisfaction; at least, all parties must be able to accept it reluctantly.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] In order to make the revision of the draft constitution more democratic, the Kuomintang convened a tea party for Kuomintang National Assembly representatives on the 15th, organized by Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, and Chen Cheng, to exchange opinions. The meeting was held in two sessions, morning and afternoon, at the Lizhi Society. Wu and Chen delivered speeches, hoping that all representatives would discuss the revision of the draft constitution in the spirit of democracy and follow the spirit of the Political Consultative Conference, adhering to the original draft agreed upon and not changing the principles. Subsequently, the representatives expressed their opinions separately, and the discussion was very lively.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Zhang Qun, and Lei Zhen, in the name of the Kuomintang, hosted a banquet for the Democratic Socialist Party National Assembly delegation at noon on the 15th. Wu delivered a speech, stating that he hoped that all parties could complete this constitution in the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation. Xu Fulin then replied on behalf of the Democratic Socialist Party, stating that this constitution is not the constitution of the Kuomintang, nor the constitution of the Democratic Socialist Party, but the constitution of the Republic of China. That is why we are participating in the National Assembly. We are determined to adhere to this spirit and treat each other with sincerity to complete this constitution of the Republic of China. The atmosphere at the banquet was extremely harmonious.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Democratic Socialist Party leader Zhang Junmai, after reading the newspaper in Shanghai on the morning of the 15th, learned that the draft constitution had been revised during the review and that the motion to change two-thirds of the attendees to two-thirds of the entire body was not adopted. Party spokesman Jiang Yuntian told reporters again on the evening of the 15th that the Democratic Socialist Party still insists on the Republic of China being a democratic republic regarding the first article, and does not even agree with the original proposal. The party's opinion on revising the draft constitution is not that it should not be revised at all, but rather that it hopes it can be revised to be more democratic. The principle is that it must not be revised if it violates the original agreement and is arbitrarily modified. Then the Democratic Socialist Party will take appropriate action. When asked by reporters whether they would withdraw from the National Assembly, Jiang did not answer, only saying: Whatever attitude is the most irresponsible is the one we will take.

### Second Meeting of the Comprehensive Committee: Continued Discussion on the Organization of National Assembly Representatives; Fierce Debate Erupted Over the Issue of Frontier Representatives

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The Comprehensive Review Committee on the Draft Constitution held its second meeting at 10:50 AM on the morning of the 15th, with 122 representatives in attendance. Chairman Wang Shijie continued the discussion on the provisions of Article 26 of the draft constitutional amendment regarding the organization of National Assembly representatives. Bi Tianmin, a vocational representative from Hejiang, first questioned the comprehensive review committee's refusal to allow reporters to attend the meeting. Chairman Wang replied that it was a decision of the presidium. Then, Zeng Jikuan, a vocational representative from Jiangsu, argued that the number of representatives from municipalities directly under the central government should be specified. Liu Zongping, a Mongolian representative, argued that the number of representatives from frontier ethnic groups should also be specified in greater numbers. Fu Sinian believed that the provision in the first item, that one additional representative should be elected for every 300,000 people in regional elections, would make the National Assembly too large. The chairman then reported that the conveners' meeting had decided to amend it to one additional representative for every one million people, asking for everyone's consideration. Ruan Zhidao and others, vocational representatives from Sichuan, believed that this provision was too strict and opposed it, advocating for it to be changed to one additional representative for every 500,000 people. At this point, Li Zhongxiang argued that there should be no special provisions for women's elections. Pi Yishu rose to oppose, saying that in the current social situation, it would be difficult for women to win in regional elections, so provisions should be added to enhance women's rights. Jiang Yiping argued that regional elections and vocational elections should be given equal emphasis. Gu Zhenggang echoed from the side. Luo Jialun, Lin Bin, Du Guangxun, Wang Xiaoying, Huang Zhengqing, Kong Geng, and others also spoke in succession, but none made any specific proposals. The chairman suggested that, except for the first item concerning regional elections, which proposed to amend it to one additional representative for every 500,000 people, no amendments were proposed for the second, third, fourth, and fifth items. He proposed submitting the original review results to the general assembly, but some representatives still requested continued discussion. Bi Tianmin, Yang Dizhong, and others spoke in succession, firmly advocating for the addition of elections for indigenous peoples and for increasing the number of representatives allocated to Mongolians, Tibetans, and other minority ethnic groups. Opponents believed that the distribution of indigenous peoples was not regional and should not be listed outside of regional elections. As for the number of representatives from various minority ethnic groups, even if it were specified, it should be done according to proportion. The sound of debate reached the outdoors. The chairman's proposal to submit his review opinions to the general assembly was put to a vote, but it could not be resolved. No results were achieved by 12:00 noon, and the meeting adjourned in chaos.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The Comprehensive Committee of the National Assembly continued its meeting at 3:40 PM, with 155 representatives in attendance, still chaired by Wang Shijie. First, he reiterated the powers of the Comprehensive Review Committee that had been clarified on the 14th, saying that the Comprehensive Review Committee, i.e., the Ninth Review Committee, was equal in status to the other eight review committees. Its power lies in discussing issues related to and involving principles across the various groups. The resolutions made cannot change the review opinions of the other eight review committees. If there are different review results, they will all be submitted to the general assembly. He also urged the representatives to speak on the topic, put forward concrete opinions, and save time. He then reported on the results of the convener's meeting at noon, submitting the organized specific articles to a vote. The first item of the review opinion on Article 26, "but those with a population of over 300,000," was amended to "500,000," and passed with 75 votes. The second item was amended to "Representatives elected from Mongolian banners (removing one "and" character), Tibet (adding seven characters) and other border regions (adding one character), their number shall be determined by law." It passed with 80 votes, but Liu Zongping and Mai Huanxin still spoke in succession, expressing their opposition to the second item. Liu insisted that the comprehensive review committee should consider the opinion of the Eighth Review Committee regarding the number of representatives elected from border ethnic groups, and that the opinion of the conveners could not be hastily put to a vote, and it should not be thought that the majority oppresses the minority. Another group of representatives believed that the provisions for the number of representatives elected from border ethnic groups were difficult to standardize and should be adapted to local conditions at any time. The spirit of another legal provision meeting is that the majority respects the minority, and the minority obeys the majority. The General Assembly has given utmost respect to the opinions of compatriots in the border areas. It cannot still be said that they have been suppressed. Force the majority to obey the minority. The heated debate unfolded again from this. The atmosphere at the meeting was tense again. Then Fu Sinian spoke, saying that since this case had already been voted on and passed, the discussion below should proceed quickly. The chairman also announced that if any representative did not agree with this vote, please reserve your opinion and express it at the general assembly. If you must submit a reconsideration to the Comprehensive Review Committee, then you must follow the procedures stipulated in the Initial Steps of Civil Rights. At this point, Liu Butong and Li Zhongxiang brought back the women's issue by returning to the meeting method, arguing that the election and proportion of women's numbers should be stipulated in the election law, and that the term "women's groups" in the fifth item of the review opinion of Article 26 was too vague, and that the scope and nature of it would easily cause the interpretation of the constitution, which would only cause disputes. They opposed listing this item in the constitution. Female representatives Gao Yiyun and Wang Xiaoying firmly opposed. Liu Butong also believed that the provisions for vocational elections in the fourth item were the same as the special provisions in the constitutions of various countries, and that the scope and nature of "vocational groups" were unknown, and there was a place to deprive universal suffrage rights, and also opposed listing it in the constitution. Zeng Jikuan and others also firmly opposed.

After two heated debates, Chairman Wang announced that these two items would be reserved and submitted to the General Assembly for discussion and decision.

Liu Zongping spoke again, claiming that if the Comprehensive Review Committee does not reconsider its decision on the second item, the Mongolian representatives will unanimously oppose it in the General Assembly. Wang Guanying expressed sympathy, saying that the Comprehensive Review Committee's disregard for the review opinions of the Eighth Review Committee has the suspicion of abusing power. Gu Zhenggang reiterated the coordinating role that the Comprehensive Review Committee must have with the preservation of the fourth and fifth items, and for a time, criticisms were raging. Li Zhongxiang then stood up to ease the situation, saying that the chairman's statement that the issue would be reserved and submitted to the general assembly did not overturn the review opinion, nor did it fail to acknowledge the opinion of the meeting. He also suggested that the issue of the number of representatives elected from border ethnic groups be left for study, and that it be discussed again when the Eighth Review Committee reviews its opinion. Liu Zongping frequently spoke, firmly refusing to recognize the vote on the second amendment opinion. Women representatives, vocational representatives, border representatives, and indigenous representatives spoke in succession, each saying that they were right, and the order of the meeting place was chaotic. Fu Sinian's suggestion of one representative per Mongolian banner, and Huang Zhengqing's compromise opinion on the issue of indigenous peoples, were all drowned in the tide of debate. The remarks of other representatives were even more of a mixed chorus, unintelligible. At 5:20 PM, Chairman Wang had lost control of the entire meeting. He accepted Hu Shi's proposal to announce the adjournment of the meeting and continued to convene a joint meeting of the Presidium and the Conveners of the Comprehensive Review Committee to facilitate discussion and seek principles for resolving the problem. The representatives left in succession amidst discussions and deliberations.

The funeral hall was set up at the Public Recreation Club.

### Sun Yaofu Discusses with Reporters About the President's Emergency Decree Power: It Is Not Appropriate to Add the Words "Emergency Accidents" to the Draft Constitution

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Regarding the amendment of Article 44 of the draft constitution by the Third Review Committee yesterday, adding the words "emergency accidents," Representative Sun Yaofu insisted on maintaining the original proposal at the time and raised objections to the addition of the four words, but the vote ultimately failed to pass. Mr. Sun solemnly stated to reporters that it should be recorded as follows: The power of emergency decrees was originally a symbol of the monarch in the imperial era. No such provision exists in democratic constitutional countries. In democratic countries, the fundamental rights and freedoms of the people cannot be infringed upon or restricted by administrative agencies. For fear that they would issue orders casually or on pretext to harm the people, prevention is taken beforehand, and the power to issue emergency decrees by the head of state is generally not listed. If very accidental events such as foreign invasion, internal rebellion, or disasters occur, the parliament may resolve to temporarily authorize the administrative agency to take emergency measures, to show that this power is in the hands of the people and the parliament, the representative of sovereignty. Article 40 of the draft constitution already has a special article on martial law, and the content of the martial law can include the handling of very accidental events such as foreign invasion, internal rebellion, and disasters. Even if it is necessary to formulate a separate emergency decree law outside of martial law, the original wording of Article 44 is sufficient to deal with it, and it is not appropriate to add the four words "emergency accidents," which are ambiguous and lack a definite definition, to reserve unlimited crises for the abuse of emergency decrees in the future. Considering the constitutional advanced countries of England and the United States, the regulations on martial law are also extremely strict. The outlines are briefly described below:

(1) In France, the parliament first formulates a martial law in peacetime, specifying the reasons, types, declaration agencies, and the results of the martial law declaration. If a real phenomenon occurs, the local officials and commanders will first implement martial law, and then the parliament will declare martial law. However, during the adjournment of the parliament, the president chairs the State Council and declares it after resolution. It is clear that this power is in the hands of parliament.

(2) The United Kingdom does not promulgate martial law in peacetime, and does not recognize the cabinet's power to issue emergency decrees in the event of a very accidental event. It must wait for the parliament to enact new laws before it can restrict the freedom of the people. However, local officials or military commanders can take emergency measures. After the event, the government consults with the parliament to pass an exoneration law to reduce the responsibility for illegal acts. Its system of preventing administrative personnel from abusing their power is stricter than the French system.

(3) The United States Congress and administrative agencies must exercise their powers in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. The Congress cannot have the power to change or restrict the freedom of the people like the British and French Congresses, but it has not been seen to delay the opportunity to deal with very accidental events.

In short, the freedom of the people is sacred and inviolable. In today's China, those who discuss the constitution should strive to protect the freedom of the people and prevent the government from overstepping its authority to deprive people of their rights. Therefore, if the power of emergency decrees cannot be fundamentally abolished, at most it can only be limited to the scope stipulated in the original Article 44, limited to natural disasters or major changes in national financial economics, and it is not appropriate to add the four words "emergency accidents."

### Wang Yuyang Reports on the Recent Situation in Dalian: Hopes That the National Army Will Receive It Quickly; The Lushun-Dalian Fellow Villagers Association Writes to Chairman Chiang

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The Lushun-Dalian Fellow Villagers Association in Beijing entertained the press at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 15th. Chairman Mu Chao gave a preliminary introduction to Lushun and Dalian, saying that Lushun-Dalian covers an area of 2,462 square kilometers with a population of 180,000, 500,000 near the urban area, and a coastline of 3,100 kilometers. The climate is mild and the products are abundant. Militarily, it is the best ice-free port in the East of our country. As early as 1905, Japan occupied it as a base, designated it as the so-called "Kwantung State" and organized the Kwantung Army, which eventually eroded the Northeast and even peeped into our entire country. This clearly shows the importance of its position, but this also makes it easier to arouse the ambition of foreigners to invade. I hope that the people of the country will not ignore the Lushun-Dalian issue. Wang Qiamin, a representative of the National Assembly in Dalian, said: I was born in Lushun. I remember that when I was born, Lushun-Dalian was under the occupation of Japanese imperialism, and I have never seen the shadow of the national flag. The compatriots there are in a dark and bitter sea every day. I hope the government will lend a helping hand. In the middle, I cited many examples. Then Wang Yuyang, the Dalian National Assembly representative who had just come to Beijing from Dalian, reported on the recent situation in Lushun-Dalian, hoping that the government would go to receive it as soon as possible to save the people from suffering. The association also prepared a letter to Chairman Chiang, the main points of which are as follows: (1) The people of Lushun-Dalian have been trapped in a sea of ​​misery for a long time. Please send the national army to receive them quickly to relieve the people from suffering. (2) The representatives of the National Assembly of Dalian City illegally used the candidate from Liaoning to replace them, ignoring the rights of Dalian, and expressed their resistance. (3) The youth of Lushun and Dalian fled to various places because they could not bear the oppression of the Communist army. I sincerely request the government to provide practical relief and organize them.

[United Press, Nanjing, 15th] According to Wang Yuyang, a member of the "Lushun-Dalian Catholic Association," when he left Dalian on September 15, the Chinese Communists controlling the area were using Japanese machinery and workers to manufacture munitions and ammunition. Although Wang was unwilling to discuss the situation of the Soviet Union in Lushun and Dalian, he admitted when questioned by reporters that the Chinese Communists had taken over the Dalian Municipal Government from the Soviet army. He said that the Soviet army stationed in Dalian on August 23, 1945, organized a Chinese police force, and established a municipal government two months later, under the control of the Chinese Communists. Mayor Jia Zixiang (transliteration) was appointed by the Chinese Communists and "completely unqualified." Deputy Mayor Chen Yandao (transliteration) carried armed forces and a large amount of cash to buy workers to support him.

### Impressions of Inspecting the Jin-Cha-Sui Border Region: American Reporter Discusses Reasons for Communist Military Failures

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 13th] Christopher Gerrien, a correspondent for Time Magazine stationed in Beijing, recently toured the Jin-Cha-Sui border region and gained a profound understanding of the wanton destruction perpetrated by the Communist troops. He firmly believes that the Communist military failures in the region are not only of great military significance, but also have a significant impact on their internal morale. Gerrien recently wrote an article in the magazine detailing his impressions of the inspection. His original dispatch begins by stating, "The 'New Democratic Politics' implemented by the Chinese Communists in the strategic northwest region abandoned by the Japanese army a year ago has failed due to mismanagement, mirroring the failure of their military plans. This is the conclusion I have reached after experiencing hardships and touring the Jin-Cha-Sui border region." Gerrien then titled a section "Showcase of Destruction," describing the situation in Zhangjiakou: "Zhangjiakou is vital to the economic life of the Jin-Cha border region. The Japanese left behind considerable economic construction. After the Japanese surrender, most of this construction remained intact, and the Communists used it as a corridor connecting Yan'an and the Northeast, and as a showcase to advertise their 'Democratic Politics.' However, not only were they unable to defend this area militarily, but they also destroyed this 'showcase' as government troops approached. In China, a country plagued by poverty and depleted resources, this act of destruction is truly heartbreaking. For weeks after the Communist retreat, Zhangjiakou's water and electricity supply had not been restored. The train station had become a graveyard for wrecked locomotives. The workers' dormitories were reduced to rubble. The Communists set fire to the post office on what they called 'Liberation Road,' and the telephone bureau opposite, which served four thousand users, is now a pile of debris. In addition to destroying transportation and telecommunications facilities, the Communists destroyed fifty-two factories, leaving three thousand workers and their families homeless."

Gerrien next titled a section "Temporary Pain," explaining the scorched-earth policy implemented by the Communists in Kouquan. He wrote: "The Kouquan coal mine is located ten miles outside of Datong, a city of 800,000 people that was besieged for forty-five days. Nearby is one of North China's largest power plants. The Communists captured Kouquan on August 1 and withdrew on October 31 after encountering government troops. When they withdrew from Kouquan, they engaged in similar large-scale destruction. Iron smelters and engine lathes were all destroyed. Burnt-out locomotives were everywhere. Broken metal equipment and rubble were strewn all over. In their political propaganda, the Communists claim that this destruction is a 'temporary pain,' but in war-torn China, the phrase 'temporary pain' has become the most bitter of terms. At the same time, the Communists have lost the most important thing in their guerrilla strategy: the support of the people."

Finally, Gerrien titled a section "Changing Moods," describing the wavering morale among Communist personnel. According to him, "Behind the barbed wire of a Communist prisoner concentration camp in Zhangjiakou, the following phenomenon was discovered: the morale of the Communist soldiers has been steadily declining. It is no wonder that the general soldiers lack fighting spirit when they enter an endless civil war filled with thorns and turn against their compatriots. One of the Communist soldiers, Wang Youming, joined the army at the age of seventeen and fought in many battles. He has now been promoted to the rank of deputy company commander and was wounded four times in the war against Japan. In September, when General Fu Zuoyi's troops advanced towards Zhangjiakou, Wang Youming and his forty-odd subordinates were ordered to defend Jining. As government troops approached, twenty-three of his subordinates were killed in action, and Wang was forced to retreat. In a state of extreme confusion, Wang asked himself, 'Why are Chinese people fighting Chinese people?' Why did we have to die in Jining? Later, Wang was questioned by a Communist political instructor (a devout believer in Communism who had participated in the 25,000-li Long March). During the conversation, Wang frankly admitted that his conscience told him he could no longer fight in the civil war. The instructor pondered for a moment and then told Wang, 'If that is truly how you feel, then you should rest. You must consider this carefully, and when your mood changes, you can return to your post.' The so-called 'rest' meant being sent to the mountains in the rear under surveillance. Afterwards, the instructor visited Wang repeatedly, but Wang's mood remained uneasy, and he said, 'I need to think more. I suffered countless hardships fighting the Japanese, but I had no regrets, because at that time my conscience was fighting alongside me. But now my conscience does not allow me to do what I am doing.' Before long, government troops recovered Zhangjiakou, and Wang's unit retreated into the mountains. Wang deliberately lagged behind the unit, wrote a letter of surrender to the government troops, contacted a certain unit of the government army, and his conscience regained its freedom."

Peng then attended the provincial party affairs cadre training class to give a speech and have lunch. In the afternoon, he toured Jiaoshan and returned to Nanjing by train in the evening. According to reporters, he said, "I did not bring any news. What I can tell you is: (1) The government reorganization is underway and can only be realized after the National Assembly closes. (2) The government still hopes for a peaceful resolution to the Communist problem. (3) The government has no intention of adjusting the exchange rate. The recent speculation in gold and silver is entirely manipulated by speculative merchants and will soon be suppressed." Finally, he wrote the inscription "Alone for a Thousand Years, Who is a Friend?" for the reporters.

### Pauley Submits Report to Truman on Inspection of Northern Korea; Soviets Seek to Control Administrative and Economic Power

[United Press, Washington, 14th] Edwin Pauley, the U.S. reparations commissioner, submitted his six-day inspection report of northern Korea (Soviet-occupied territory) to President Truman. The report stated that the Soviet Union's objective may be to force the establishment of a Moscow-controlled government throughout Korea and then agree to withdraw its troops. Pauley's investigation team of nineteen people entered northern Korea accompanied by a squad of Soviet soldiers equipped with American rifles. The Soviets directly and firmly prevented the Americans from talking to Koreans, even saying that they would shoot the Americans' interpreter. At one point, a Soviet general told Pauley that the Americans would regret it if they did not stop taking photographs. Pauley said that when he first met with General Chistiakov, the commander of Soviet forces in Korea, Chistiakov could not agree on the area that the American investigation team was to visit. Pauley then used diplomatic tactics, presenting Chistiakov with a beautiful sword, and the two had a more harmonious second meeting. Chistiakov reciprocated by giving Pauley a beautiful dagger and serving him a typical Russian dinner, with an ample supply of vodka, exceeding the drinking limit several times. Pauley said, "When the investigation team passed by factories, the train would speed up, which may have been coincidental, but it is also uncertain." When the Soviet side claimed that a certain machine tool factory did not exist, Pauley ordered his Korean translator, Mr. Zhang, to try to find it. Pauley said, "This was a rather important task because the Soviet officers ordered Soviet and Korean translators to surround Mr. Zhang. Every move of this person was bound to be monitored, and every question was met with shouts. They clearly did not want us to obtain any information from the Koreans." The factory was finally discovered next to a certain power plant, but the equipment in the power plant had been completely removed. Pauley found that industry in northern Korea was still active, unlike the destruction of industry in the nine eastern provinces of China, but the Soviets seemed to be promoting communism to the people and seeking to control all administrative and economic power. Banners hung in the streets praising the Soviet government as "the highest form of democracy." However, there were some signs that the Koreans were not fully cooperating with the Soviet occupying forces. Pauley said, "After dusk, incidents between Soviet troops and Koreans were endless. General Chistiakov had to issue an order stipulating that no Soviet soldier could travel alone after dusk. However, two or three Soviet soldiers were still killed each time. The Koreans had no weapons other than stones."

Editorial

### Looking Ahead to the Blum Cabinet's Future

After French Socialist leader Léon Blum was elected Prime Minister with the support of various French parties, he began to form a cabinet. In recent days, he has consulted with leaders of various parties on the matter of cabinet formation and is expected to complete the task within days. Post-war France is also experiencing times of great difficulty, and the people of the country are eagerly hoping that the new cabinet can be established as soon as possible to cope with the various difficult problems currently facing them. According to a broadcast speech to the nation by Blum himself, he also hopes that the new cabinet can be formed within days so that he can attend the National Assembly tomorrow, and also expressed his hope that the new cabinet will be established as soon as possible, even more urgently than anyone else. Based on this, it is naturally certain that the new French cabinet, under the leadership of former Popular Front leader Blum, will be organized and completed within days.

Post-war France, although also a country with many difficulties, especially in terms of finance and economics, has many holes and sores. It is really not an easy task to talk about revival and prosperity; however, French politics in the year since the war has made considerable progress. Some people call France a newly emerging European nation, which is not an exaggeration. In the past year, France has held several general elections, and the results have consistently shown the advantage of left-wing parties. Whether in the National Assembly or the Senate, the Communist Party is in a leading position, but the number of seats won by its rival party, the Popular Republican Movement, is not much different. Therefore, the Communist Party cannot obtain a vast majority on any issue if it does not receive the support of the Socialist Party, the Radical Socialist Party, and the Left Wing Alignment Movement. For example, in this National Assembly election of the Prime Minister, Communist Party leader Maurice Thorez did not obtain the necessary number of votes, resulting in his defeat. In the second vote, the Popular Republican Movement candidate, the current interim President and Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Georges Bidault, followed in Thorez's footsteps and failed. This phenomenon is rarely seen in the history of political parties in various countries. Finally, as a result of talks among the leaders of various parties, it was decided to support Socialist leader Blum as a candidate for Prime Minister, and submit it to the National Assembly for a vote. With the unanimous support of members of various parties, he finally obtained the necessary number of votes and was elected. However, it goes without saying that the foundation of the Blum cabinet is entirely based on compromises among various parties and is not very solid.

However, looking at the economic situation in France and looking back at the international environment, the most suitable candidate to take on the role of Prime Minister at this time is none other than Blum. The reason is very simple, because the most serious problem currently facing the French government is the financial problem. France suffered greatly in the Second World War, and was also ravaged by the German occupation. Its vitality was greatly damaged, and it was not easy to recover for a while. Therefore, since France gained liberation, the lives of the French people have not been improved by liberation; if they want to revive and prosper in the future, they must find ways to obtain economic assistance from foreign countries. Blum, in the spring and summer of this year, did not hesitate to endure the hardship of long journeys and traveled to London and Washington to visit the British and American authorities and negotiate Anglo-French and Franco-American economic agreements, all of which have achieved significant results. Therefore, Blum not only knows the domestic economic situation in France very well, but also, judging from the current situation, only Blum can take on the difficult task to solve France's current economic difficulties.

As for the international environment in post-war France, France is situated between the Slavic and Anglo-American blocs, and often feels the pain of being in a difficult position on both sides. It goes without saying that the situation is difficult. In the past ten months or so, France's foreign policy has indeed achieved considerable success under the wise leadership of Foreign Minister Bidault. Especially in successive international conferences, France has stood in the middle of the two major blocs, mediating disputes, doing its best to mediate, and acting as a bridge to connect the opinions of both parties, making significant contributions to the achievements of successive international conferences. However, the joys and sorrows of international relations have their objective factors and cannot be controlled by any one country. Foreign Minister Bidault sometimes feels frustrated and powerless. Therefore, the French politician who must take on the difficult task at this moment must be a figure who can be welcomed by both sides, and Blum is the most suitable candidate with this dual personality.

The French are the nation with the most opinions, and everyone has their own unique views on politics. Reflected in politics, this has formed a phenomenon of numerous small parties. Therefore, party politics in France is the worst of the democratic advanced countries. In particular, ordinary politicians spread rumors, stirred up trouble, and caused political tides in France to emerge one after another, and the political situation rarely remains stable, so that established national policies are not easily implemented. This is the worst thing about French politics before the war. Although politics has progressed after the war, this unfortunate phenomenon still exists, which makes us unable to harbor excessive expectations for the future of the Blum cabinet. Therefore, general political observers are not overly optimistic about the future of the Blum cabinet, and deeply fear that the Blum cabinet is a transitional government, and its life will not be long. Moreover, although Blum himself served as Prime Minister of the Popular Front cabinet in 1936 and has rich political experience, he is old and his health is worrying. Can he take on this important task for a long time? This is still a serious problem.

However, what France urgently needs at the moment is political stability. It must not be like the pre-war era, with political tides rising and falling one after another, so that the country's established policies cannot be implemented. The leaders of various parties should accept the lessons of France's defeat in World War II, put the interests of the country above those of the party, and be able to work together with one heart to strive for France's revival. Even if the Blum cabinet is a temporary transitional government, it will be able to open up a new path for the various parties to cooperate and jointly seek France's recovery in a short period of time. This is the common expectation of people inside and outside France for the Blum cabinet; it is also Blum's own wish.

The provincial government's temporary office has now been established in Huaiyin, and Shan Gong, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, is in charge of all emergency matters in the recovered areas. Chairman Wang Maogong will frequently travel back and forth between Huaiyin and Zhenjiang, and will inspect the recovered counties at any time. On the eve of his departure for Huaiyin, Chairman Wang convened the heads of various provincial units to review and instruct the work of various departments, promising to pay attention to "restoring order and establishing security," and will strive to coordinate politics with military affairs to achieve the task of pacification. As for the refugees stranded in northern Jiangsu, the Social Affairs Department is working with the Suning Branch to expedite their repatriation. The situation of land tax collection throughout the province is good, and highways are being actively developed. The budget revenue and expenditure for the provincial and county local budgets in the 36th year are severely insufficient, making the compilation extremely difficult. The land registration and education of various counties in northern Jiangsu are of great importance, and appropriate measures have been formulated to facilitate their implementation. The establishment of security throughout the province and the implementation of health administration are particularly active. The county magistrate examination will be held in the shortest possible time, and the provincial training corps is training transferred military officers. Once they graduate, they can be assigned to positions. Generally speaking, Jiangsu's politics are gradually returning to normal.

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 15th Dispatch] The new county magistrate, Mr. Shen Chenglong, received reporters from our newspaper at his residence in the afternoon of the 15th and made an important speech on the administrative guidelines for the future: I have been ordered to be the county magistrate of Wu County and will follow the will of the provincial authorities and the expectations of the people. I will formulate plans for promoting general administration according to the urgency of local needs. It is difficult to be specific at present, but the focus will be on (1) education, (2) construction, and (3) city appearance. Moreover, I sincerely decided on two major principles of governance: (1) personnel selection should be fair and based purely on talent; (2) in the use of money, at this time of popular shortage and financial constraints, we should strive to reduce expenditure. Therefore, some redundant county-level structures will be abolished. Shen also said that preparations are being made to complete the merger of townships in the 36th year. In the future, the 保長 (bao trưởng, village head) in each township will implement a new system. However, this expense is not included in the county budget and will be allocated from the profits of township production to enable sound grassroots politics. After this, the appointment of township chiefs can also be strictly selected.

### Changshu Dike Repair

[Our Newspaper Changshu Dispatch] Changshu County borders the Yangtze River, and low-lying farmlands account for one-third of the county. Existing dikes were built to prevent flooding, but due to years of neglect, the base of the dikes has loosened. This year, the water level suddenly rose, causing the Jinjia Dike between Zhuang and Cheng, as well as farmlands in Dongtang Town, Renyang, Shipai, Hengjing, and Bai regions, to be submerged. River water overflowed, making it difficult to plant crops, resulting in severe losses. The Dike Repair Committee has decided to urgently repair the dikes, establishing engineering offices in Guli Village, Dongtang Town, and Xinzhuang, which are located in the central areas of the dike region. Once funding is allocated, surveying and earthwork will commence. It is estimated that the entire project will require at least fifty clear days to complete and construction can begin around the Qingming Festival next year.

### Preventing the Resurgence of Banditry - Yangcheng District Suppression Headquarters Not Dissolved - Bandit Traces Still Exist in the Suburbs of Changshu

[Our Newspaper Suzhou 15th Dispatch] The Yangcheng District Suppression Headquarters originally planned to dissolve upon the approximate completion of the suppression campaign. However, the Wuxi Headquarters, considering the current winter defense period, feared that disbandment would lead to a resurgence of banditry. Therefore, it telegraphed the headquarters here to maintain its original state. Furthermore, with concurrent commander Major General Ma Shigong having been ordered to move to Nanjing, Deputy Commander Xu Binguang has been temporarily appointed to fill the vacant commander position.

[Our Newspaper Changshu Dispatch] Following the attack on Guli Town outside the East Gate of Changshu, military and police forces are continuing to search and suppress bandits, maintaining vigilance throughout the night.

Late in the evening of the 13th, rumors spread that Guli Town was under attack again, but these were confirmed to be false. Currently, the town's security is jointly managed by Acting Town Head Yao Kunsheng, Deputy Head of the Defense Team Zhang Lvyuan, and Security Team Leader Qian, and the situation is considered stable.

[Our Newspaper Changshu Dispatch] Bandit traces still exist near Guli Town.

After the recovery last year, the route was the first to be repaired and opened to traffic. However, the bus stops at these two locations have not yet been restored, causing inconvenience for travelers. Recognizing this, the township offices of Tangqi Township and Shi Dike Township petitioned the county government to forward the request to the Liang Yin Feng Bus Company for restoration to facilitate travel. Upon approval from the Yin Feng Company, artisans have been instructed to repair the original station sites, and bus stops will commence on the 20th.

### Ministry of National Defense Sends Military Judge to Suzhou - Thorough Investigation of Conscription Irregularities - Xia Dingjiu Presents Evidence and Accuses Multiple District and Township Heads

[Our Newspaper Suzhou 15th Dispatch] Xia Dingjiu, a respected elder in Suzhou party circles, noted that during the conscription of temporary soldiers for the 35th year in this county, many district and township heads took the opportunity to collect excessive levies and embezzle funds, not only exploiting the people but also hindering conscription efforts. With the official conscription for the 36th year approaching, he believed that failing to act swiftly to remedy the situation and punish those responsible would only lead to greater abuses. Therefore, he directly submitted a report to the Ministry of National Defense, listing evidence and secretly accusing multiple district and township heads in this county. In addition to ordering the Suzhou Garrison Command to conduct an investigation, the Ministry of National Defense specially appointed Military Judge Huan Ze from the Military Law Department to come to Suzhou and reside in the Garrison Command's Military Law Office to be responsible for thoroughly investigating the truth and severely punishing the perpetrators according to the law.

### Rehabilitation in Sichuan Province Comes to an End - Construction to Begin Next Year - Policy Plans Decided - Funding Seriously Insufficient

[Our Newspaper Chengdu Dispatch] The rehabilitation work carried out by the Sichuan Provincial Government this year is coming to an end, and next year will mark the first year of construction work. The Sichuan Provincial Policy Work Plan for the 36th year has now been approved by the Provincial Government and will be issued to all counties and cities for implementation. The main points are: (1) Civil Affairs: 1. Rectify political discipline; 2. Complete local autonomy, including strengthening people's organizations at all levels, household administration organizations, townships, and reorganizing household registration, issuing national identity cards, etc.; 3. Strengthen police administration; 4. Promote national compulsory labor. (2) Finance: 1. Reorganize autonomy, taxes, public property, finance, and business tax, deed tax, and land tax; 2. Reconstruct township public markets; 3. Strengthen financial personnel and treasuries. (3) Education: 1. Expand secondary education; 2. Genuinely rectify academic atmosphere; 3. Popularize national education; 4. Promote social education; 5. Strengthen educational administration. (4) Construction: 1. Increase production of grain, sugarcane, cotton, and special products; 2. Construct small and medium-sized water conservancy projects; 3. Build roads to improve transportation; 4. Improve handicrafts. (5) Society: 1. Strengthen organization and training; 2.

New undertakings will require vast expenses, making the promotion of new policy construction even more difficult. Deng Hanxiang, Director of the Provincial Department of Finance, has decided to fly to Beijing within days to request a solution from the central government.

### Jiaxing Distributes Self-Defense Firearms

### Salesmen Compete to Purchase and Transport - Chaos in the Bengbu Salt Market

[Our Newspaper Bengbu Dispatch] The prices in the Huai salt sales area suddenly became unbalanced. As the prices here are relatively low, salesmen competed to purchase and transport salt outwards, rushing to be the first. Supply could not meet demand, and salesmen repeatedly caused disturbances at the Transportation Association. As a result, the salt market has been in a chaotic state for the past ten days. While sales were brisk, there was little salt left in warehouses, and scheduled sales were suddenly interrupted. There are currently over 200,000 dan of Huai salt stockpiled at the Pukou Railway Station. However, due to the scarcity of vehicles, loading and transportation are relatively slow, resulting in a sharp decline in recent deliveries. Bengbu City and nearby counties are brewing trouble, and disputes have repeatedly arisen within the Transportation Association due to the demand exceeding supply, undermining its prestige. It is imperative that the authorities devise a way to increase supply, maintain order, and ensure the availability of salt to the people, while curbing competitive purchases.

Excessive Valuation of House Tax in this City

Having read the article by lawyer Lu Xinghou in your esteemed newspaper criticizing the inappropriate house tax in this city, I find it truly reflects the public opinion of the citizens. However, lawyer Lu spoke from a legal standpoint, only addressing the points where it fails to comply with the law, and has not yet discussed the actual situation of excessive and inflated valuations. I would like to add the following to illustrate the suffering of the citizens under this heavy tax. The most unreasonable aspect of the autumn house tax payment notice issued by the Finance Bureau is that it only seeks to increase revenue by arbitrarily inflating rental values, disregarding reality. For example, the house I rent had a monthly rent of 90 yuan in the 26th year of the Republic (as evidenced by the landlord's house certificate, with only 270 yuan per quarter), but the Finance Bureau assessed it at 4,500 yuan, collecting 450,000 yuan in house tax and municipal tax, exceeding the actual rent by more than ten times. Before the war, the usual rent for a house in Hongkou was at most 100 to 200 yuan per month, as those who have lived in Shanghai for a long time know. Now, the Finance Bureau has assessed it at a staggering 1,500 yuan, perhaps because they have just flown in from Chongqing and are unaware of the situation in Shanghai. Furthermore, for Shanghai houses, except for those rented out by private individuals where contracts, account books, and house certificates may be forged and unreliable, those rented out by formal banks have well-organized account books and receipts, providing legitimate evidence that cannot be denied. However, the Finance Bureau does not rely on the legitimate documents from the 26th year of the Republic to calculate the house tax, but instead relies on imagination, arbitrarily assessing the value, which is not legal. Moreover, the former Municipal Council had a good precedent for the house tax valuation method, which the Finance Bureau has not adopted. It is said that the house tax files of the former Municipal Council are available, and the Finance Bureau can consult them to calculate the rent based on the house tax amount of the 26th year of the Republic, which would be more accurate. However, it does not do so, resulting in arbitrary assessments that resemble extortion. All of us citizens should protest in unison and request the Finance Bureau to revoke these illegal valuations and reassess the tax amount based on the actual rent to alleviate the suffering of the people. I also urge the councilors who have seen this report to promptly propose a motion for correction. (Chen Guanyu)

### Two Lingbi Stones Cause a Sensation in Yangzhou City

— Yangzhou Dispatch: Special Correspondent Wang Gonghan

After reading the title of this article, readers may wonder: "What? Two stones actually caused a stir in Yangzhou?" The reporter's answer is: "Yes."

Love of Antiques, Buying Stones

The matter originated with Liang Diancheng, the owner of the Sanhe Canggongke restaurant here. This Mr. Liang has always been a well-known antique enthusiast, especially for calligraphy and paintings. To put it bluntly, his love is almost eccentric. When traveling outside or socializing, if he encounters genuine pieces by famous artists and can buy them with money, he will not hesitate to spend heavily to acquire them. If the owner of the piece is not concerned about money, he will spare no effort, rack his brains, rely on friends' relationships, or use other flattering methods to get what his heart desires.

A friend of Mr. Liang, Shen Dakezhu, had a batch of calligraphy and paintings last year that he had promised to sell to him. At that time, Mr. Liang paid a deposit of 900,000 yuan to Shen. Later, Shen sold the calligraphy and paintings to someone else. As a result, Mr. Liang naturally became Shen's debtor for 900,000 yuan.

The month before last, in order to repay Liang's debt of 900,000 yuan, Shen used two Lingbi stones that he had stored at home as collateral. People who love calligraphy and paintings will also be interested in stones. In addition, these two stones were indeed somewhat unusual. When struck, they emitted a sound like a "qing" (a chime stone instrument). Liang Dian, who has always had a keen eye for antiques, thus, in a situation that was not exactly a transaction but was in fact a transaction, one afternoon, these two Lingbi stones were carried from Shen's home to Liang's house by several employees of Liang's company.

Exquisite Shape, Suitable for Appreciation

It took several employees to carry them, so the weight of the two stones can be imagined. At the same time, this was due to the presence of foam wood bases. The shape of the stones was that of a reclining dragon. On the surface, the color and texture of the stones did not seem much different from ordinary Qingshan stones. However, when struck, they did emit a metallic sound. The reporter's residence is in Mr. Liang's house, so I know this clearly. However, the other virtues of the stones remained a mystery to the reporter. At most, they were "exquisite in shape and suitable for appreciation."

The stones had been placed in Mr. Liang's flower hall for a week when the trouble began. It started when the stones were being carried out of Shen Dake's house.

Tribute of the Late Qing, Invaluable

It turned out that when the employees were carrying the stones on the road, Mr. Tang Shumei, a former teacher at the Eighth Middle School, caught sight of them and immediately took notice, following them all the way to the entrance of Liang's house. Because: Mr. Tang knew that in the old Yangzhou Prefectural Office (i.e., the former site of the Eighth Middle School), there were two Lingbi stones. It was said that those two Lingbi stones were purchased in Anhui during the late Qing dynasty by the Yangzhou salt merchant Huang Yingtai and were prepared as tribute to be presented to the Qianlong Emperor. However, Qianlong died before they could be presented, so they were left in the Yangzhou Prefectural Office. Thus, Mr. Tang was concerned because he believed that the two Lingbi stones that Liang Dian had bought were public property from the old Yangzhou Prefectural Office.

Was it out of concern for public property, or out of cherishing public property, ultimately to protect public property? Mr. Tang Shumei reported what he had seen to the county government. After receiving the report, the county government sent personnel to investigate and then had the stones in Liang's house carried to the county government. As a result, rumors spread like wildfire in society. Some said that the two stones could be sold for tens of millions of yuan and cited an example of a foreigner who had wanted to buy them. Some said that the two stones were priceless because otherwise, how could they have been used as tribute to the Emperor?

Public or Private Property, Awaiting Judgement

After this trouble arose, Liang Diancheng stated that if the stones belonged to the public, they could be returned to the public. The purchase price of 900,000 yuan could be counted as used for other purposes. However, another rumor then circulated in society, saying that he had stolen public property. He became anxious when he heard this because during the enemy-puppet period, the old Yangzhou Prefectural Office had been occupied by the enemy for eight years, and no one had ever gone to see whether the two Lingbi stones were still there. Even Mr. Tang Shumei, who reported the matter to the county government, was the same. After the victory, the National Army was stationed there, and naturally, no one would have bothered to go and see the condition of the two stones.

However, Liang Dian, who was in trouble, was different. In addition to confirming with Shen Dake that the two Lingbi stones he had sold him were indeed not public property, he ran to the old Yangzhou Prefectural Office to look for the public's two Lingbi stones everywhere. As a result, he found one in a pile of horse manure. Accompanied by the local gentleman Hu Xianbo, he inspected it and said that the stone was indeed the original one. Thus, Liang Diancheng even took a photo of the stone. However, the other stone has not yet been found, so the matter has not yet been resolved.

The day before yesterday (the 8th), the county government, in order to emphasize public property and respect the reporter's spirit of protecting public property, originally planned to invite well-known figures in Yangzhou society, including Shi Zongying, Chen Hanguang, Dai Xingyi, Bao Xiangzhong, Zhu Ganchen, Yang Zuojie, and other gentlemen, to the county government to jointly appraise whether the two stones that Liang Diancheng bought from Shen Dake were indeed not public property in order to resolve this case. As a result, because not all of those invited arrived, an appraisal could not be made. Thus, this case is still being watched by all the people of Yangzhou today (11th).

### United Nations General Assembly Declares Adjournment - Foundation for Lasting Peace Laid - Disarmament Charter Passed by Assembly - South African Union's Request to Annex Southwest Africa Rejected

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 14th] The second part of the first session of the United Nations General Assembly has concluded, effectively marking the formal establishment of the UN organization. As such, the foundation for humanity's pursuit of lasting peace through collective action has been laid. The first part of the first session was held in London earlier this year. During the two parts of the session, the major organs of the United Nations have been established. The Security Council and the Economic and Social Council were established in London, and the Trusteeship Council was established in New York following today's vote. With this, the entire plan has been declared complete.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 14th] The United Nations General Assembly, amidst cheers, passed the "Disarmament Charter," urging all nations to limit and universally reduce their maintained armaments. Universal disarmament, stipulating effective guarantees to ensure compliance by participating nations, and establishing regulations for the control of the atomic bomb. The final version of the resolution passed consists of nine sections. Last night, when British Foreign Secretary Bevin, US Secretary of State Byrnes, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov discussed it, they all delivered lengthy speeches, extending past midnight before concluding. However, today it was passed after only half an hour of discussion. The only speakers today were Canada's Martin and France's Parodi, both of whom ardently supported the proposal. British representative Shawcross had endorsed this proposal in the committee and revealed that a disarmament conference would be convened within six months. Last night's discussion saw friends of the representatives and the public filling the meeting hall to listen to the three foreign ministers' eloquent speeches in support of the proposal. Today, feeling fatigued, and with the General Assembly swiftly concluding the matter, the attendance was not as crowded as last night. Although Molotov and Vyshinsky had worked hard to express the Soviet Union's views during the debate, they were not present today to witness their work achieve final satisfactory results.

In addition to passing the "Disarmament Charter" today, the General Assembly also passed the following resolutions: (1) The United Nations' budget for the coming year, totaling US$27.74 million, including US$601,800 for the International Court of Justice. The United States is to pay 39.89%, the United Kingdom 11.48%, the Soviet Union 6.34%, and China and France 6% each. (2) Concerning the plan proposed by the Political and Security Committee on the issue of investigating foreign stationed troops of member states. The Soviet representative, Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko, expressed dissent regarding this plan, requesting that the information to be provided by the member states should include detailed information on general armaments at the same time, otherwise it would still be insufficient. The Soviet Union's position remains that the issue of foreign stationed troops should be considered together with the issue of troops maintained within their own countries. Therefore, he requested that the Security Council decide what information is necessary for the implementation of disarmament, and requested that the United Nations General Assembly decide whether the investigation of member states' troops should be limited to their foreign stationed troops or should also include troops maintained within their own countries. Finally, the General Assembly submitted the military investigation plan proposed by the Political and Security Committee to a vote, passing it with 36 votes to 6. The major powers all voted against, and four national representatives abstained. (3) Regarding the trusteeship issue, the draft resolution proposed by the representatives of Denmark, India, and the United States, arguing that the South African Union should not annex its mandated territory of Southwest Africa, was also passed by a majority of 37 votes, with nine national representatives abstaining. In addition, Mexico and Iraq each received 36 votes and 34 votes, and were elected as member states of the Trusteeship Council. The General Assembly adjourned at 6:15 PM.

### Trusteeship Council Established - Ten Nations Including China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union Appointed as Council Members

[United Press, New York, 14th] The General Assembly today established the Trusteeship Council, with the main objective of enabling millions of non-self-governing people around the world to eventually achieve independence. This is the last major organization established within the United Nations structure, and together with the already established Security Council, Economic and Social Council, International Court of Justice, and Secretariat, it completes the world peace organization as stipulated in the United Nations Charter. Initially, the Trusteeship Council will only supervise the administration of eight trust territories, all of which were former League of Nations mandated territories, with a total population of 15 million people. However, it is hoped that one day, the entirety or a majority of the hundreds of millions of people who currently lack full independence will be brought under its governance. The main objective of the Council is to gradually lead all territories under its supervision towards independence, and its current task is to ensure that the trust territories are managed in accordance with the best interests of their residents. The General Assembly has elected Mexico and Iraq as council members, joining China, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, Belgium, Australia, and New Zealand as ex officio council members, forming a total of ten seats. If other territories subsequently join the trusteeship, the number of council seats will also change accordingly. For example, once the former Japanese mandated territories of the Marshall Islands, Caroline Islands, and Mariana Islands join the trusteeship, the United States will become an administering power, and a non-administering member state will need to be elected. President Truman recently announced that the former Japanese mandated territories will soon be proposed as "strategic area" trust territories. The territories currently under the jurisdiction of the Trusteeship Council are British Togoland, Cameroon, Tanganyika, French Togoland, Cameroon, Western Samoa under New Zealand's trusteeship, New Guinea under Australia's trusteeship, and Ruanda-Urundi under Belgium's trusteeship. The South African Union's request to annex the mandated territory of Southwest Africa has been rejected by the General Assembly, which has ordered that the territory be placed under United Nations trusteeship.

### Conference on Non-Self-Governing Areas Convened - Philippine Amendment Passed

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 14th] The United Nations General Assembly today passed by a large majority the Philippine proposal regarding the convening of regional conferences on non-self-governing territories and peoples, as well as the Cuban amendment to that proposal. When the General Assembly debated the Philippine proposal, both the United Kingdom and the United States strongly opposed it. Later, a compromise proposal was put forward by the Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, followed by another amendment from the Cuban representative, which resolved the dispute. When the Philippine amendment was finally put to a vote, there were 31 votes in favor, one vote against, and 20 abstentions. The resolution passed stated: "The United Nations General Assembly recommends that member states of the United Nations administering non-self-governing territories convene conferences, with representatives selected or elected from the populations of the non-self-governing territories, so as to give these populations an opportunity to express their wishes and views, in accordance with the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter." Before the vote, there was a lengthy debate, with US representative Dulles and UK representative Eavor calling for the rejection of the resolution, arguing that in its current form, it was inconsistent with the spirit of the Charter. French representative Parodi also vehemently opposed it, claiming that the resolution would shake the foundations of the Charter and would result in chaos, suspicion, and distrust among nations. At this point, Chinese representative Gu Weijun spoke from a conciliatory position, stating that in his opinion, both sides had presented sincere arguments, but the issue at hand was too important, and millions of people were awaiting a response, so it could not be ignored. He proposed that the Philippine resolution be amended to "the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations should invite the administering powers of non-self-governing territories to convene conferences of the populations of these territories." Philippine representative Romulo immediately thanked Gu. The US representative also stated that he was willing to express his support in the spirit of coordination, but the French representative remained opposed. After considerable discussion, the Cuban representative put forward a new amendment, arguing that member states should directly convene regional conferences of non-self-governing peoples if they deemed the situation permissible. This amendment ultimately passed with a two-thirds majority.

### Restrictions on the Use of Veto Power

Small Nations' Struggle Ends in Failure

[United Press, New York, 14th] The struggle of small nations to deprive the five major powers of their veto power in the Security Council, after years of effort, has ended in failure today, and they have had to concede. This most contentious issue in the United Nations organization has temporarily come to an end. The only achievement of the small nations' arduous struggle is a motion urging the five powers, China, the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France, to use the veto power as little as possible, but they failed to have it revoked. However, according to various indications, the small nations will continue to fight later until the five major powers agree among themselves that they no longer need to use this privilege. The Soviet Union has exercised the veto power as many as nine times, so it bore the brunt of the discussion, but it remained steadfastly opposed and voted against the motion. Of the five major powers, only the Soviet Union alone held opposition, while the Slavic bloc supported it.

### Freedom of the Press Conference - Decision to Convene Next Year

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 14th] The General Assembly today decided that the United Nations Economic and Social Council will convene an international conference on freedom of the press next year to stipulate the responsibilities, rights, and methods of exercising freedom of the press. The representatives participating in this conference must be individuals who have close ties to the press, broadcasting, and film industries, or who have experience in the aforementioned fields. The resolution passed by the General Assembly emphasizes the necessity of achieving and maintaining freedom of the the press, so as to promote sincere international cooperation. The first part of the resolution stated: "Freedom of the press is one of the fundamental rights of mankind. Political freedom of the press is a necessary factor in the pursuit of world peace and progress. The principle of freedom of the press should stipulate that those who enjoy this right should not deliberately abuse it. The moral responsibility of searching for facts without prejudice and publishing them without malice is a major factor of freedom of the press. Furthermore, international understanding and cooperation are impossible without a sound and always attentive world public opinion, and to achieve this, complete freedom of the press is required."

### World Capital - Decision to Establish in New York

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 14th] The General Assembly tonight decided by a majority of 46 votes to 7 that New York will be the permanent seat of the United Nations organization.

The General Assembly adopted the report of the Headquarters Committee regarding the Rockefeller family's donation for the construction of the headquarters, and decided that the designated architects should submit architectural designs by July 1 next year.

### UNRRA Far East Relief Work - Decision to End Next June

Future Relief Plans Agreed Upon

[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th] The UNRRA Council of 48 nations, holding its sixth meeting, reached an agreement on the major differences regarding the future relief organization plan with the Soviet Union, and adjourned today. The Council passed a compromise plan, recognizing that the Central Committee may make changes to the uncompleted US$600 million plan. It is apparent that the establishment of this motion represents a partial victory for the United States, whose government believes that a flexible plan should be established to allow for the supply of necessary goods to Austria, Greece, and Italy, as these countries are indeed in dire need of relief. Today's resolution also agreed that UNRRA should strive to complete its procurement of relief supplies in Europe and its relief work no later than March 31 next year, and in the Far East no later than June 30 next year. This resolution has also extended the original completion date by 90 days. If UNRRA fails to complete its procurement or transportation of relief supplies by the above-mentioned date, UNRRA has the right to arrange for the contract to be handled or continued by the relief recipient countries themselves. As the US Congress stipulated when appropriating funds to UNRRA that the organization should end its operations in Europe by March 31 next year and in the Far East by June 30, the motion did not stipulate any period beyond this. The United States should provide UNRRA with funds. The Council also decided today to convene the seventh Council meeting, which would also be the final meeting, before June 30 next year, unless the Central Committee unanimously believes that the meeting is unnecessary, in which case it will be canceled. The Council also approved the 1947 UNRRA budget of US$9.5 million, with the United States bearing the largest share, 40%, and China bearing 5%. The Council instructed the Central Committee to report on plans to encourage the return of displaced persons and agreed to encourage the automatic establishment of various organizations to cooperate with UNRRA and provide them with assistance.

### US Giant Liner "Queen Elizabeth" - Carrying Dignitaries from Various Countries Back to Europe - Byrnes Returns to Washington

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 14th] The magnificent British liner "Queen Elizabeth" set sail from here at 11:15 PM today, bound for the United Kingdom. The ship was packed with dignitaries, more than ever before, virtually a "floating United Nations organization." The ship carried a total of 2,265 passengers, including dignitaries such as British Foreign Secretary Bevin, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, Danish Foreign Minister Rasmussen, Polish Foreign Minister Rzymowski, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Simić, Yugoslav Ambassador to the Soviet Union Popović, Romanian Foreign Minister Vlăsceanu, and Belgian representative Lanczhoff.

### British General Mountbatten - Praises Burma Campaign

[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] Former Supreme Allied Commander Southeast Asia, Admiral Mountbatten, declared at a meeting of the British Ex-Servicemen's Association today that the Battle of Kohima in the Burma campaign may become the greatest battle in history. I do not wish to disparage the great achievements on the Western Front, but the troops crossing the Rhine had modern equipment, and the width of the Rhine was only one-fifth of that of the Irrawaddy. I believe that the achievement of supplying the entire Fourteenth Army by air is unprecedented.

### Shen Zonglian Visits Nehru in India

Warmly Received in Nepal

The Nepalese Prime Minister was extremely excited about the award of a medal to our country, and he said in his speech: "Our country's first contact with China was very early, when the valley here was still a lake. According to historical records, Manjushri came from China and excavated Mount Katwa to guide the water out." He also awarded our delegation the Gurkha Right Hand Medal.

### Distribution of Japanese Reparations - Implementation Possible Early Next Year

Soviet Union Remains Silent

[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th, United Press] Although the Soviet Union remains silent on the issue of Japanese reparations, the US government still hopes to obtain the agreement of the Allied nations to the US plan, so that the distribution of Japanese reparations can begin early next year. Some official personnel said today that they doubt whether Pauley's report, which criticized the Soviet army for being responsible for US$2 billion in factory losses in the Northeast, can influence the Soviet Union's attitude towards Japanese reparations or the support of other Allied nations. Regardless of whether the Soviet Union replies, the US government should be able to implement the US plan after January 1 next year, at which time it will first distribute 15% to 20% of the reparations. Well-informed sources pointed out that the criticisms in the Pauley report have already been concretely expressed. Pauley's criticism is no more intense than the US government's note to Moscow in February protesting the Soviet army's removal of factories from the Northeast.

### Unprecedented Great Fog in London - Transportation All Blocked

Churchill Unable to Return Home, Spends Night in Hotel

[United Press, London, 14th] Heavy fog has enveloped the British Isles and northern Europe for five consecutive days, described by the Automobile Association as the worst in living memory. Sea, air, rail, and road traffic, and even underground trains, have been disrupted. Ships scheduled to depart from Southampton have all been suspended. Former Prime Minister Churchill was attending a banquet somewhere, but was unable to return home due to the heavy fog and spent the night in a hotel. At the same time, thieves were very active. Mrs. Sahara, an American-born woman, had her handbag stolen, losing jewelry worth 22,000. At the Venezuelan ambassador's banquet, furs and jewelry worth 2,400 were stolen. The police station received threatening phone calls, saying that they would blow up the police station and the Marble Arch monument, so precautions have been taken. At the same time, anonymous letters were received threatening to blow up Victoria Station.

### Blum Strives to Negotiate - New French Cabinet to be Established Soon

[Our Report] Paris, 15th Broadcast: Blum has obtained the agreement of the parties to participate in the four-week government after continuing to meet with party leaders today. The Communist Party has agreed to Blum's cabinet formation plan, but expressed opposition to the participation of far-right parties.

[Reuters, Paris, 14th] The new Prime Minister Blum's organization of the government is reported to have reached a compromise with the Communist Party, with a joint government being organized by the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the People's Republican Party, or possibly one or two members of the moderate Conservative Party. Blum is still discussing candidates with the main parties.

[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 14th] Regarding the election of French Socialist Party leader Blum as Prime Minister, it has been commented on by local political figures that 74-year-old Blum is the best person to take on this difficult task. Prime Minister Blum will surely implement his friendly policies towards Vietnam, which is indispensable for the happiness of both France and Vietnam.

### Labor Strikes in Korea Repeated - Clearly Have Political Background

Assassination Attempt on Syngman Rhee Occurs

[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] MacArthur today released the Korean occupation report for September, stating that labor strikes have occurred repeatedly in January, there is no sign of industrial recovery, and there was an assassination attempt on Korean independence movement leader Syngman Rhee. Three newspapers were temporarily suspended. Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US forces in Korea, delivered a speech, issuing a warning that the strike of 30,000 railway workers on September 22, which disrupted transportation in southern Korea, had a political background and was intended to hinder the US forces in Korea. The striking workers did not make demands in advance, nor did they attempt to mediate, and their intention was obvious. The amount of banknotes issued by the Bank of Korea has increased from 1.285 billion to over 11.3 billion. Although policing has improved, the number of crimes in August increased in all but one province. Hoarding remains rampant, preventing the rice collection plan from being completed soon. Part of industrial production is affected due to a lack of balanced development, and the wages earned by workers are insufficient to maintain their lives.

### New Lebanese Cabinet Established

[Agence France-Presse, Beirut, 15th] Prime Minister Solh has formed a new Lebanese cabinet. The new cabinet will follow the previous policy, maintaining a completely neutral position towards Greater Syria and the Arab League.

### Cartoon Industry in Recession - Donald Duck, Bugs Bunny

[United Press, Hollywood, 14th] Cartoon characters Donald Duck, Bugs Bunny, and Andy Panda seem to be becoming less active on the screen, and there may be a day when they become extinct. The prospects for cartoon film production in Hollywood are bleak. Columbia Pictures has abandoned its film, and other companies are also preparing to announce their abandonment. Len Schlosser, chairman of the Screen Cartoonists Guild, said: The opportunity to watch cartoons will decrease in 1947, and 1948 is even more unthinkable and pessimistic. The reason is that since 1941, the cost of making cartoons has increased by 165%, while the rental fee for showing cartoons has only increased by 12%. Although movie theaters are more crowded than ever, the rental price of cartoons remains unchanged at US$2.50 to US$4 per day. In addition, it is difficult to print color cartoons, and black and white cartoons are not popular with audiences. Therefore, the golden age of cartoons will gradually disappear.

There may be a day when they become extinct.

### Japanese Economic Situation Deteriorates - Anti-Cabinet Movement Expands - 30,000 Elementary School Teachers Demonstrate Demanding Pay Raise

(Our Tokyo Dispatch, 15th) The domestic political and economic situation in Japan is deteriorating day by day, and inflation is seriously threatening people's livelihoods. The Socialist Party and the Democratic Party have decided to submit a request to the parliament on the 17th for Yoshida to resign. In addition, 2.5 million national laborers from Japanese industrial labor unions will hold a rally on the 17th to overthrow the cabinet. The current government has strictly prohibited government officials from participating.

[Our Tokyo Dispatch, 15th] Approximately 30,000 representatives of elementary school teachers across Japan gathered in front of the Imperial Palace on the 14th, resolving to demand a pay raise in order to maintain their livelihoods. After the meeting, they marched to the Ministry of Education and negotiated with Minister of Education Tanaka, who expressed great sympathy and was willing to do his best to raise their salaries.

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 15th] The Japanese National Party held a cadre meeting today to discuss its attitude towards the Socialist Party and the Democratic Party's proposal to dissolve the parliament. After consultation, they agreed to expand their approval and decided to hold a meeting of party members tomorrow to make a formal decision.

### Large Increase in Taxes a Heavy Burden on the General Public; City Council Budget Committee Discussed Yesterday; Believes City Finances Are Close to Balanced, Should Not Double Tax Collection

[Our Own Correspondent] The Budget Committee of the City Council held its third meeting yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. at the Council, attended by eight councilors including He Yuanming, Xu Yongzuo, and Li Wenjie. Deputy Speaker Xu Ji, Secretary-General Xiang Changquan, and City Government Accounting Director Xiang Fan were also present. He Yuanming chaired the meeting. The committee discussed the matter of autumn and winter property taxes and municipal construction taxes being too heavy a burden on the people, and the necessity of reconsidering this. This proposal was originally made by Li Wenjie and seconded by Zhu Fuqiu, Yan Yilin, Qu Yue, and He Yuanming. A temporary motion stated: This council approved the city government's supplementary levy of municipal construction tax on property tax during the autumn and winter seasons of this year to offset part of the 22,149,432,241 yuan shortfall in the city's budget for the second half of this year, so that the city's construction expenditures would not be completely unsupported. This was originally a temporary emergency measure. According to the original estimate by the Municipal Finance Bureau, the autumn increase was 2 billion yuan per month, totaling 6 billion yuan, and the winter increase was doubled to 12 billion yuan, totaling 18 billion yuan. In the revised budget submitted by the city government to this council, under the item of land improvement tax revenue in the regular revenue category of ordinary income, property tax is listed as 900 million yuan, and property tax attached to municipal construction tax is listed as 18.8079912241 billion yuan in the temporary revenue category of ordinary income, which is based on the above estimated figures. The Municipal Finance Bureau has already begun collecting the autumn municipal construction tax. Citizens who have received payment notices all feel that the amount is enormous, and some even say that the tax is too heavy and unbearable. Normally, for Grade C houses with an annual rental value of less than 1,000 yuan in the 26th year of the Republic, the autumn tax is almost three times higher than the summer tax (using my own house as an example, the estimated rental value is 588 yuan, and the autumn tax is 29,400 yuan, of which only about 20% of the actual rent is property tax borne by the landlord). The summer tax was only 11,112 yuan (shared equally with the landlord), the spring tax was only 2,470 yuan, and the winter tax last year was only 1,233 yuan. In one year, the tax amount has increased nearly 24 times. Although the amount is not too large, for Grade A (annual rent of 1,800 yuan or more in the 26th year of the Republic) and Grade B (annual rent of 1,000 yuan or more but less than 1,800 yuan in the 26th year of the Republic) houses, the tax amount is often tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands or millions of yuan, which is indeed the heaviest burden imposed on the citizens of the city since the establishment of the City Council in order to balance the city budget. This council's resolution on the Municipal Finance Bureau's policy report originally stated that "if the tax revenue in the second half of this year can exceed the original estimate by one-half, the city government's shortfall can be easily resolved without increasing taxes and burdens on the people." The land value tax and business tax levied in the second half of this year will certainly be higher than the amount listed in the original budget. It is estimated that the increase in revenue in the autumn will not be less than 6 billion yuan. The Municipal Finance Bureau should clearly state the total amount to be collected. If it has reached half of the 18 billion yuan budgeted, the winter tax should not be doubled. If the total amount to be collected exceeds half of the 18 billion yuan budgeted, the winter tax rate should not only not be doubled, but should also be verified and reduced to take into account the taxpayers' ability to pay under the current economic downturn, while supporting the city government's budget. Furthermore, the current year is coming to an end, and the Municipal Finance Bureau must be clear about the actual revenue and expenditure of the city's finances, and the exact amount of the shortfall. If the overall revenue and expenditure shortfall is not too large, there is no reason to double the winter municipal construction tax. It was resolved to transfer this case to the Finance Committee, and to hold a joint meeting with the Finance Committee today, inviting Finance Bureau Director Gu Chunfan to attend and report in detail on the amount of all tax revenue to be received in the second half of this year, and how it compares to the budget. If the revenue and expenditure can be balanced, the winter property tax and municipal tax will not be doubled, and other matters will be resolved.

### Plan to Build Huashan Road; Decision to Demolish Sixteen Houses

As for other cases: (1) Approved the City Government's letter submitting the revised budget for the second half of the 35th year of the Republic. It was resolved at the second meeting to publicly elect three councilors, Li Wenjie, He Yuanming, and Yan Yilin, to review and submit a resolution for public decision. The review opinions were passed, and Councilor Xu Yongzuo supplemented that both expenditures and revenues must be studied in detail and the reasons thoroughly investigated before they can be passed. (2) The General Assembly referred the City Government's letter submitting the final account for the previous year. It was discussed at the second meeting and resolved to publicly elect three councilors, Xu Yongzuo, Qu Yue, and Wang Naixu, to review and submit a resolution for public decision. Councilor Xu Yongzuo reported on the meeting with Accounting Director Min, stating that the review of the final account should be based on the budget, but the budget was compiled later, and the final account almost conforms to it. At the same time, the budget was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval after it was compiled, but there has been no reply to date. The current focus of research is whether the revenue and expenditure of the final account are legal and whether the procedures are appropriate. The relevant vouchers have been sent by the City Government to the Audit Office for handling, and there are no further comments. Therefore, this case cannot be discussed and can only be analyzed and observed based on the report. (3) Approved the transfer of the project to build the 21-meter northern section of Tianmu Road within the budget scope by the Public Works Committee. It was resolved at the second meeting to publicly elect Councilor Zhu Wenqi to send someone to the Secretariat to conduct an on-site inspection before requesting review and approval. After Secretary-General Xiang reported on the investigation, it was decided to send the resolution of the Public Works Committee to the Public Works Bureau for revision and submission to the committee for review. (4) Approved the transfer of the budget plan and drawings for the construction of Huashan Road for reconsideration by the Public Works Committee. It was resolved at the second meeting to publicly elect Councilor Zhu Wenqi to send someone to the Secretariat to conduct an on-site inspection before requesting review and approval. (5) Approved the City Government's letter to transfer the funds for Zhongshan South Road to build the Huashan Road widening project for review. The above two cases were discussed together. Secretary-General Xiang reported on the investigation, stating that Huashan Road is the corner of Haig Road, Shanzhong Road, and Dianjun Road. The houses protrude into the road, which is very inconvenient for traffic. If they need to be demolished, 16 houses will be partially demolished, of which only two are two-story buildings, and the rest are bungalows. The total cost, including compensation, is 100 million yuan. The committee resolved to approve it. In addition, the Secretariat of the Council transferred the resolution of the fifth meeting of the Education Committee, requesting discussion on three points regarding the adjustment of salaries of principals of national schools as a reference for budget preparation. It was resolved that the budget for this year has already been finalized by the City Government and it is not appropriate to add to it. It will be submitted for reference when reviewing the budget for the 36th year of the Republic.

### Collection of Land Value Tax; Zhu Ping Discusses the Process

Expected to Collect 3 Billion Yuan This Year

Zhu Ping, Director of the Municipal Land Administration Bureau, hosted editors of various newspapers in the city at the New Life Club last night to report on the process of collecting land value tax in the city. He stated that the city's collection of land value tax was ordered by the Executive Yuan and urged by the City Council. Preparations were made in haste, and collection began on the 16th of last month. After the collection began, the people actively paid taxes. 1.8 billion yuan has already been collected, accounting for 60% of the amount to be collected. It is expected that 3 billion yuan will be collected this year. The city government has promulgated the "Shanghai Municipal Land Value Tax Late Payment Penalty Measures." Those who fail to pay taxes by the deadline will be fined and charged a late payment fee. The bureau has sent staff to distribute notices and urge payment, but is not responsible for collecting tax payments. All tax payments are collected by staff from the Treasury Department stationed at various tax calculation offices. Citizens are requested to pay attention. If owners have not received a notice due to a change of address, they are requested to go to various tax calculation offices to calculate and pay taxes to avoid fines. Those whose land has been occupied should still pay land value tax because land value tax is collected based on ownership. Those whose land has been occupied can clear the occupants according to the law. Those whose land has been occupied by private individuals can sue in court. Those whose land has been occupied by government agencies can request the occupying agency to return the land, provide compensation, collect taxes, or provide rent. They are also requested to report to the bureau so that it can assist in transferring the request for clearance. Foreigners who own land in Shanghai should also pay land tax. Regarding the issue of land valuation, Zhu said that the bureau followed legal procedures and was evaluated by the Land Valuation Appraisal Committee. Regarding the registration of foreign land, the registration procedures have been negotiated with the consulates of countries that have signed equal and reciprocal treaties with us. Foreigners from other countries without treaties and stateless foreigners who own land in the city must register before the end of the year. Otherwise, all land will be regarded as ownerless land. The bureau has cleared public land. To avoid omissions, the "Measures to Encourage Reporting Concealed Public Land" has been formulated. Anyone who secretly reports and is verified will be given a bonus of 20% of the value of the land found. Land that was originally private land but has become ownerless land due to the disappearance of the owner should be owned by the public. Those who report the occupation will also be subject to the above measures.

### China National Aviation Corporation Passenger Plane; Careless Landing Causes Accident; China Airlines Plane Damaged in Collision

[Our Own Correspondent] An airplane collision occurred at Longhua Airport in the city at about 5 p.m. the day before yesterday. A China National Aviation Corporation plane, fully loaded with passengers from Beijing to Shanghai, was almost completely destroyed due to a careless landing. The plane was a C-47 type 67 passenger plane on the Beijing-Shanghai route, and the pilot was American Captain Napki. When it arrived at Longhua Airport, dusk had already fallen and it was drizzling. Napki piloted the plane from south to north, landing on the runway with a northeast wind. However, due to landing too quickly and without reducing speed, the plane bounced up and then descended again, sliding forward. At this moment, the plane's direction changed and it turned to the left side of the runway. This area was originally a public parking area with five China Airlines planes parked in a row. The China National Aviation Corporation plane that ran off the runway immediately crashed into the first China Airlines plane No. 104 on the right, its left wing shearing off the tail rudder of the China Airlines plane. The left engine and propeller also cut into the right wing of the China Airlines plane, and the right engine destroyed part of the right wing of the China Airlines plane. At this time, the right engine of the China National Aviation Corporation plane immediately caught fire. At the same time, due to the obstruction of the China Airlines plane, it stopped moving forward. This can be said to be a blessing in disguise, because if it had continued forward for another 50 yards, it would have collided with a hangar full of gasoline, which would have resulted in a fire, destroying both the plane and the people, which would have been unimaginable. After the China National Aviation Corporation plane had an accident, the flames from the right engine were extinguished. Except for one passenger who was injured, the rest were unharmed. After being ordered by the government to cease flying, China Airlines has already transferred the aforementioned five planes to Xin Sui Company (a company that has been operating transportation services in Xinjiang and Suiyuan). Yesterday, the person in charge of Xin Sui Company told reporters that plane No. 104 was damaged for no reason and will file a protest with China National Aviation Corporation today, and reserves the right to demand compensation.

### Whereabouts of Missing Passenger Plane Unknown; Central Air Transport Corporation Dispatched Two Planes Yesterday; Searching the Suzhou-Wuxi Area

[Our Own Correspondent] Central Air Transport Corporation Flight No. 31 has been missing since it disappeared on its way from Beijing to Shanghai the day before yesterday. The company's flight crew sent planes to search the Suzhou-Wuxi area all day yesterday, but found nothing. When the company's planes flying to Ping, Kun, and Yu took off yesterday morning, they were instructed to search along the Beijing-Shanghai line, but found nothing. In the afternoon, two special planes were dispatched to search. The first plane was No. 47, piloted by pilot Hong Qiming, accompanied by co-pilot Liao Yuehan and radioman Wang Feng, and took off at 12:05 p.m. The second plane was No. 39, personally piloted by Chief Pilot Chen Wenhui, accompanied by co-pilot Mao Xinguan and radioman Jiang Yuchun, and took off at 1:45 p.m. This reporter boarded special plane No. 39 to search for the missing passenger plane. At that time, the weather had cleared up, and weak sunlight shone through the clouds. The wind direction was the same as the day before: wide northeast wind. Visibility was also good, reaching more than five jia.

After taking off, Flight No. 39 flew 20 degrees west, intending to explore the mountains south of Suzhou. The reporter looked down from an altitude of 1,500 feet, and saw fields, rivers, and thatched houses clearly. After Qingpu, there were many lakes. Crossing Dianshan Lake, Cheng Lake, and Jiuli Lake. At about 2 p.m., crossing Baodai Bridge south of Suzhou, the special plane turned southwest and soon approached the Dongshan Mountain in Dongting. The crew members were very nervous. When the special plane circled this small hill, they all strained their eyes to search the foothills, hillsides, and ridges, but saw only yellow soil and white stones, peaceful as ever, with no anomalies. After circling twice for ten minutes, it turned to other places. All the mountains near Dongting West Mountain, Yangshan Mountain, as well as Guangfu, Shanren Bridge, and Mudu Town, such as Qionglong Mountain, Qizi Mountain, and Lingyan Mountain, were thoroughly explored, and even half of Taihu Lake on the east coast was searched, taking one and a half hours, but nothing was found. It then returned to base. At 3:45 p.m., it returned to Longhua Airport and landed, flying for exactly two hours. Another special plane, No. 47, also flew back to the airport at 2:15 p.m. and searched the Huishan area of Wuxi, but found nothing. It is reported that the missing passenger plane was Flight No. 31, the Beijing-Shanghai flight, which was carrying passengers and transporting banknotes to Shanghai on the 13th (Friday). It usually stayed overnight in Beijing and flew from Beijing to Shanghai at 2 p.m. on the 14th. Thirty minutes after takeoff, it communicated by radio with another passenger plane en route, inquiring about a leather bag left in Beijing. Forty-five minutes later, the aviation stations in Beijing and Shanghai no longer received its radio signals and could not get a response, so it was reported missing. The captain of the plane was Ma Faxiang, and the co-pilot was Zhang Shudong, both of whom were experienced pilots. According to aviation experts, the reason may have been the bad weather on the 14th. The pilots may have lowered their altitude due to low clouds and heavy rain, causing them to hit a mountain somewhere. Therefore, the two special planes that set out to search yesterday targeted the mountains in the Suzhou-Wuxi area. The company has not given up hope that the missing passenger plane may have been forced to land, and is still making every effort to find it, hoping that the plane and the people can return safely.

### Names of Two Passengers Identified

[Another News] This newspaper's special correspondent in Nanjing reported at midnight last night that the missing Flight No. 31 was carrying a total of 31 boxes of banknotes from Ping to Beijing. In addition, there were two passengers who temporarily requested to board the plane in Beijing. Their names were Xue Jin and Dai Tianfang. It is reported that Dai did not expect to travel, but Xue insisted on boarding the plane temporarily, so they departed together.

Then, a policeman slapped him on the mouth, and he spat out a small luminous watch. Thus, both the person and the stolen goods were seized. He was temporarily detained and will be sent to the judicial authorities for investigation.

### Founded in the Sixth Year of Tongzhi, with a Long History; Jiangnan Shipyard Actively Reviving; Modern Equipment and Careful Management; Managing with Difficulty to Become China's Largest Shipyard

[Our Special Feature] In this industrially backward China, all heavy industrial equipment must rely on foreign countries. Although the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy cannot currently build something like the "Queen Elizabeth" ship, it can not only build ships for China itself, but also build ships for foreign countries. This can indeed make us raise our eyebrows and exhale! Everyone knows that the President ships of the American Dollar Steamship Company are world-renowned and occupy a very high position in the history of China's shipping industry. However, few people know that the four 10,000-ton freighters that they newly added in the ninth year of the Republic were built by our Jiangnan Shipyard for them.

Building Ships for the United States for the First Time During World War I

Jiangnan Shipyard was founded in the sixth year of Tongzhi. At that time, it was still operating at Ti Diao Bridge. Later, the Manufacturing Bureau allocated part of the Gaochang Temple site as a shipyard. In the early years of the Republic, it was renamed Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy. At that time, the equipment was very simple. In 1914, World War I broke out, and the United States allocated funds to build four 10,000-ton ships. By 1920, they were built and handed over to the Dollar Steamship Company. Later, the surplus was used to expand the shipyard, and then six gunboats were built for the US Navy. Ma Deji, the director of the shipyard, took charge of the shipyard in the sixteenth year of the Republic, left the shipyard in the nineteenth year, and returned to the shipyard in the twenty-second year. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, in the autumn of the thirty-third year of the Republic, he and more than 20 other engineers went to the United States to serve at the US naval shipyard, studied for more than a year, returned to China, and rejoined the shipyard. His biggest goal was to expand the Jiangnan Shipyard and make it a modern shipyard. After Ma Deji negotiated in the United States in various ways, the United States and China reached an agreement to supply the shipyard with equipment and materials worth a total of US$10 million. One-third of this batch of materials has been shipped, and the rest are being shipped to China one after another. In six months, the equipment can be ready. As for the repayment method, it will be paid off in 30 years, with one-thirtieth of the amount repaid each year, but not in cash, but in shipbuilding labor.

Three Shipyards and 5,000 Employees

The shipyard was occupied by the enemy during the fall of Shanghai, almost completely destroyed, and the arsenal was destroyed to expand the site. Therefore, when the shipyard was taken over, it had a total of 500 acres of land, which was more than twice as much as before the war. However, the machinery and factory buildings had only losses and no additions. Currently, due to limited funds, it can only be gradually restored, but reporters who visited the various office locations have already felt the grandeur and orderliness of the scale.

The internal organization is divided into: (1) General Affairs Department, (2) Design Department, (3) Production Department, (4) Personnel Office. In terms of equipment, there are three shipyards: one 500 feet long and 78 feet wide, which can accommodate ships weighing 10,000 tons; one 575 feet long and 78 feet wide, which can accommodate ships weighing 15,000 to 20,000 tons; and one 62 feet long and 100 feet wide, which can accommodate ships weighing 30,000 tons. Other facilities, such as electrical plants, refrigeration plants, welding plants, engine plants, and foundries, are all complete and will be expanded. The accounting department inside the shipyard is particularly modernized, with international business machines, which is one of only two in China, which can save two-thirds of the manpower. The total number of employees in the shipyard is more than 5,500, including 379 technical personnel, 4,882 workers, and soldiers, etc. There are seven American engineers, two British engineers, and one Japanese engineer who is an electrical engineer, who will resign at the end of this year. There are also more than 20 female employees who are responsible for clerical work.

Strong Productivity and Emphasis on Welfare

The shipyard's production capacity is quite strong. It can build three 10,000-ton ships in one year, and can also build other small ships at the same time. It can build more than ten ships of 2,000 to 3,000 tons for coastal use in one year, and also build ships for inland rivers. It can build 30 ships of 100 to 1,000 tons for inland river travel every year, and also build tugboats, barges, and steel structures. In the past year, it has repaired and built 582 ships of various sizes, including foreign naval and commercial ships. Currently, 73 ships are being repaired and 41 ships are being built.

The management and welfare of employees are very well organized. Director Ma hopes that employees will regard the factory as their home, establish close relationships, and stabilize their lives. There is a reading room, an economical Chinese and Western canteen, a barber shop, a bathroom, a laundry, and a sewing room inside the shipyard. However, the dormitory is quite a problem. The existing dormitory can only accommodate more than 100 people. A large dormitory will be built in one or two weeks to accommodate more than 2,000 workers. The internal equipment is also as complete as possible. In order to subsidize the lives of employees, the shipyard has a consumer cooperative, and marriage, funeral, childbirth, and education subsidies. The wages of workers are based on the cost of living index, and the base salary is based on the 26th year of the Republic, with the lowest daily wage estimated at 6,000 yuan and the highest at 18,000 yuan. Workers work from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day. Registration is done according to the new American factory system, and salaries are paid by a special office set up by the Bank of China.

Visiting the Vast Ship Repair Project

In addition, apprentices are given technical training after work. The qualification is four years of training after graduating from elementary school. After graduation, they become fifth-grade craftsmen. Apprentices are provided with food, clothing, and accommodation and are also given a stipend.

Yesterday, the reporters were hosted by Director Ma and led by several engineers, including Shan Yunxiang and Huang Lv, to visit and explained in detail. Ships are being repaired in the shipyard, and the project is very vast. It is reported that the cost of repairing ships and the docking fee are calculated according to tonnage, at 800 yuan per ton. The first day of docking is charged in full, and the subsequent days are charged at half the price. Other repair costs, machine assembly, etc. are charged separately. The reporters walked a lot and visited a lot of factory buildings. It is said that it is only a part of it. According to the shipyard staff, it takes at least three hours to visit and inspect all of them.

Jiangnan Shipyard is the largest shipyard in China. As the country is starting to build after the War of Resistance Against Japan, how much should we value such a national treasure! We expect to see it expand step by step and bring glory to our country's industry!

Giant Ship Under Repair (Photo by Our Reporter)

[Our Report] Yesterday was Sunday. The Great Light Cinema added an early morning showing at 8:30 AM to entertain the National Army. The film shown was "Sharpshooter." About twenty minutes after the start, inside the main hall, approximately three to four hundred soldiers from the First Company of the Third Battalion of the Central China Railway of the Northeast Railway Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, stationed at 381 Sun Temple Road in Zhabei, and thirty to forty Youth Army soldiers quarreled over seating. The theater was immediately in turmoil, with loud voices and disrupted order. The lights were then turned back on. At this time, the White Crane Road Military Police Team, stationed at the cinema to maintain order, led by Squad Leader Xie Chunting, fearing an incident, had Squad Leader Xie step forward alone to dissuade them. Unexpectedly, the traffic police not only ignored the劝阻, but with a shout, used their leather belts as weapons to brutally beat him, causing serious injuries. He was carried to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment. At the same time, the cinema, seeing the seriousness of the situation, immediately reported to the White Crane Road Military Police Team. Company Commander Deng then dispatched Platoon Leader Liu Weihong to lead the entire military police force to quell the disturbance and secretly sent military police to identify the traffic police who committed the assault, marking a cross on their clothing with chalk. When the play ended and the audience exited, the military police had reinforced the team and waited at the door, prepared to arrest the traffic police with white crosses on their clothing. They detained seven people, including Zhou Ping. It is reported that Squad Leader Xie suffered injuries to his abdomen and face. Afterwards, a senior traffic police officer came forward to mediate, expressing deep regret for the unjustified assault on Squad Leader Xie by the illegal police officers and intending to publish an apology in the newspaper. They also agreed to bear all medical expenses. The police conflict came to an end.

### Wartime Confiscated Vessels: Mostly Discovered in Japan, Zhou Maobai Reports on Investigation and Negotiations, Expected to be Returned After Sufficient Evidence is Presented

The number of ships seized and sunk by Japanese invaders during the war was extremely large. In order to negotiate compensation with Japan, President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, specially dispatched Zhou Maobai, Director of the Central Shipbuilding Plant of the Resources Committee, to Japan to investigate and negotiate the issue of ship compensation. The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau recently received Zhou's investigation report from the Chinese Mission in Japan, stating: "For all of our country's ships that were seized or sunk by Japan during the war, efforts should be made to search for detailed manuals, nationality certificates, and related documents for forced acquisition or requisition of each vessel. These should be completed as soon as possible before the end of this month and attempts should be made to keep them in Japan in order to negotiate their return. Difficulties in negotiation will arise if the deadline is exceeded." Zhou also presented the recent investigation and negotiation situation to President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, and sent a letter to the Shanghai Shipping Association, the contents of which are:

A. The ships whose whereabouts are known and are under negotiation are: (1) The "Continent" (大陸號), investigated by the Japanese government?

The damage to the rear two vehicles was lighter. There were no deaths or injuries. The police took the three cars and the drivers to the New City Branch for questioning.

### Great American Shipping Company Establishes Branch in Shanghai

[Our Report] The American Great American Shipping Company (United States Line), headquartered in New York, operates vessels on the Atlantic route. It has more than sixty vessels of over 10,000 tons, and large passenger ships exceeding 30,000 tons, having a long history in the American Atlantic shipping industry. After this victory? Some of the vessels carried relief supplies to China, managed by the American President Lines in this city. Recently, the company believes that the Far East route should be developed, so it established a branch in Shanghai and purchased more than forty new vessels dedicated to the Pacific China-America route. It is scheduled to be established on January 1 next year, with offices located on the second floor of No. 17 Zhongshan East Road (Bund). Tong Xinyuan has been hired as the Chinese Manager, and Qiu Guosheng as the Chief Accountant. Mr. Tong has considerable experience in shipping affairs, having served in the American President Lines (formerly the Great American Shipping Company) for more than twenty years and has always been valued by the company's management. This time, upon transferring, the President Lines repeatedly tried to retain him, but Mr. Tong had already accepted the offer from the Great American Company and had to resign from his original position. The night before last, his colleagues and friends from import and export companies, transportation and customs clearance industries celebrated Mr. Tong's promotion at the Jingmian Restaurant. More than 150 people attended. Senior Western staff members from the Great American Company, Mr. Ring, Mr. Carey, and Mr. Stedam also attended.

### Compensation for Wartime Casualties in this City Will be Increased by 1,250 Times the Original Amount, Personnel Office of the Municipal Government Drafts Plan for Implementation After Approval

[Our Report] The Municipal Government recently received instructions from the Executive Yuan, which stated: "The compensation standards set in the 'Implementation Measures for Compensation for Casualties Among People Defending the Territory' have only been increased once since the promulgation of these measures in the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), issued at five times the original amount. Considering current prices, this is truly a drop in the bucket, and it is necessary to revise it significantly. The Henan Provincial Government has requested an increase in the above standard to the Yuan, which was referred to the Ministries of Interior and Finance for review and was submitted to the 762nd meeting of this Yuan in October this year for decision: The compensation standards can be handled at the discretion of each provincial government. As for the funding for this compensation, now that the fiscal revenue and expenditure system has been reformed, it should be coordinated by the provincial budget, in addition to reporting to the Supreme National Defense Council for record and distribution, it is hereby ordered to comply." After receiving the above instructions, the Personnel Office of the Municipal Government considered the actual price situation in the city and used the current price of rice as the standard, increasing the original standard by 1,250 times.

Increased Once in the 32nd Year

The Implementation Measures for Compensation for Casualties Among People Defending the Territory were promulgated in the 27th year of the Republic (1938). They stipulated that people injured or killed while defending the territory could receive a one-time compensation of 80 yuan and an annual pension of 50 yuan. Those with first-class injuries (such as those who are blind in both eyes) could receive a one-time compensation of 70 yuan and an annual pension of 40 yuan. Those with second-class injuries (such as those with a disabled hand or foot) could receive a one-time compensation of 60 yuan and an annual pension of 35 yuan. Those with third-class injuries (such as those who are deaf in one ear or have a missing nose) could receive a one-time compensation of 40 yuan and an annual pension of 30 yuan. The above compensation standards were increased once in the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), issued at five times the original amount. At that time, the highest compensation was 400 yuan of national currency and an annual pension of 250 yuan. If converted at the price of rice at that time, the one-time compensation could be used to buy about 2 shi of rice, and the annual pension could be used to buy 1 shi and 2 dou and 5 sheng of rice.

Adjusting Standards with Reference to Rice Prices

Since then, prices have risen repeatedly. Considering the current situation, the price of rice is about 250 times higher than that in the 32nd year of the Republic (the current price of rice is 50,000 yuan per dan), which is equivalent to 1,250 times that of the 28th year of the Republic (1939). Therefore, it is proposed to adjust the city's compensation standards with reference to the current price of rice, increasing the original amount specified in the implementation measures by 1,250 times. For example, those injured or killed while defending villages and towns, whose original one-time compensation was 80 yuan, will receive a one-time compensation of 100,000 yuan after being increased by 1,250 times (still equivalent to 2 shi of rice). The original annual pension was 50 yuan, and after the increase, it will be 62,500 yuan (still equivalent to 1 shi and 2 dou and 5 sheng of rice).

The proposed adjustment method has been drafted by the Personnel Office of the Municipal Government and will be implemented after being approved by this Municipal Government meeting.

### The Pawnshop Industry in Shanghai

Although Shanghai is a financial hub with more banks and money shops than anywhere else, they are mostly inaccessible to ordinary people. Only pawnshops provide a place for them to exchange goods for cash. The saying that "pawnshops are the maternal uncles of the poor" is very accurate.

Shanghai is also a paradise for adventurers and a breeding ground for speculative crimes. The rise and fall of families and the success or failure of individual careers can change in an instant. Therefore, the pawnshop industry has emerged in response to these conditions. In recent years, the cost of living has risen, and small citizens and salaried workers cannot make ends meet. Do they want to borrow from relatives and friends? In today's world of coldheartedness and indifference, who will open their wallets to help? Only the clothes on their backs can be pawned to exchange for some money. Although the term is short and the interest is high, it is a stopgap measure that quenches thirst with poison. However, under the pressure of livelihood, where else can they find a better method?

Therefore, this old-fashioned rural financial institution—the pawnshop—is found on every street in Shanghai, as common as fortune telling paper shops. However, truly worthy of the name "pawnshop" are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Most engage in high-interest exploitation, sucking the blood of the poor. According to past regulations, pawnshops had to obtain a license from the ministry before they could operate. Even now, they must first register with the competent authority and cannot operate until they obtain a registration certificate. The length of the term and the level of interest are also strictly restricted. Therefore, opening a pawnshop requires a huge amount of capital.

The Symbol of a Pawnshop

Pawnshops are inherently rather lofty and majestic. With sturdy walls, they seem profound and mysterious. If it weren't for that huge character "當" (pawn) , people would mistake them for government offices. Inside the gate, there is also a wooden screen to separate the interior from the exterior. Because pawning something is an unseemly matter, the screen conceals the interior, preventing outsiders from seeing inside at a glance. However, pawnshops in Shanghai are now scattered everywhere, but they are pitifully small, mostly only one room. Due to competition among the shops, neon lights are installed at the entrance, emitting dazzling light in the evening and late at night, as if waving to people and giving customers a kind of irony. Some arrange display windows, showcasing many pieces of jewelry. These are all dead goods waiting to be sold. In the commercial center of Shanghai, pawnshops have reversed their past solemn attitude and have become completely commercialized.

The counters of pawnshops are often higher than those of other shops. Poor people standing under the high counter have to look up and still cannot clearly see the items on the counter. This high counter and the appraiser's face, with its towering arrogance, are enough to bully the pitiful poor. In front of the counter, iron railings are densely arranged, separating the trade through the railings. In a small pawnshop, the area in front of the counter is very small, often too small for customers to turn around.

### The Huizhou Gang and the Chaoshan Gang

Pawnshops in Shanghai are mostly run by people from Huizhou. At that time, banks were still in their infancy, and people below the middle class did not have dealings with money shops. When they encountered economic difficulties, they would take their belongings to pawn to solve their immediate needs. Therefore, the poor regarded pawnshops as their only savior. It was expected that pawnshops would make a profit. Later, people from Chaoshan also successively opened pawnshops. However, considering that the terms of Huizhou pawnshops were too long and required a large amount of capital, they created small pawnshops, shortening the terms. The business of small pawnshops gradually expanded, creating another situation in the industry. Thus, for a time, the pawnshop industry in Shanghai was exclusively dominated by the Chaoshan and Huizhou gangs. Later, the local people also used their huge floating capital to participate in this industry, gaining momentum and eventually surpassing the others. The Chaoshan and Huizhou gangs, in turn, became outdated and retreated.

### Past History

Pawnshops are places where wealth gathers, so they are easily coveted by thieves. In times of chaos, pawnshops are often the first to suffer. After the chaos subsides, amidst the devastation, pawnshops begin to regulate people's livelihoods again. Therefore, the rise and fall of the pawnshop industry are closely related to governance and disorder. During the Taiping Rebellion in the Qing Dynasty, pawnshops in Shanghai suffered heavy looting, and little remained. After the rebellion was settled, the local authorities established public pawnshops to help those who survived the disaster. Many private pawnshops were largely established according to the regulations of the public pawnshops. Small pawnshops were a special product of the concessions. After the opening of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, the market in Zhabei gradually prospered, and small pawnshops gradually appeared. Since the Republic of China, the county towns were demolished, and roads were rebuilt, and small pawnshops invaded Nanshi. During the peak period of the pawnshop industry, there were more than 80 large pawnshops and more than 500 small pawnshops in Shanghai. Later, the global economic panic attacked Shanghai, and many pawnshops also suffered the same fate, losing money year after year, and many went bankrupt one after another. Before the outbreak of the War of Resistance, there were less than 200 left.

The flames of the "August 13th" incident (Battle of Shanghai) caused everyone to flee to the former concessions to seek refuge. They were in dire straits and had to rely on pawning to survive. The pawnshop industry then prospered again, and new pawnshops were established in increasing numbers, reaching over 1,000 at most. After the victory, many have closed down, but there are still more than 900 registered with the Social Affairs Bureau. However, the current interest rates are very high, coupled with heavy taxes, and even the high-interest pawnshops are struggling to maintain themselves. At the same time, the social purchasing power is weak, and the pawned items are not easily sold after the term expires. It seems that the pawnshop industry is gradually declining.

### Black-Hearted Exploitation of Ordinary People

In the past, formal pawnshops stipulated a term of 18 months, with a grace period of five days after the expiration date. The interest rate was 1.8 to 2% per month, plus 1% for "storage fees," which were distributed among the staff. Later, the Chaoshan gang operated pawnshops because they did not have a large amount of revolving funds, so they shortened the term to six months or eight months. In fact, since Shanghai opened its port, it has been trending towards prosperity and fashion. Clothes placed in pawnshops for a year and a half are already out of fashion, especially women's clothing, which changes constantly. Therefore, the outdated clothes after the term expires are not easy to sell. In the past, selling expired goods could still earn 30 to 40% interest, but later it became the opposite, losing 200 to 300 yuan for every 1,000 yuan. Therefore, large pawnshops gradually shortened the term to 12 months. Small pawnshops reduced it from six months to four months.

As for interest rates, in the past, except for large pawnshops that still followed the regulations, small pawnshops were roughly divided into three levels: 3% for loans above 3 yuan, 3% for loans above 2 yuan, and as high as 4.5% for loans below 1 yuan. The smaller the pawn loan, the higher the interest. Some even had a term of ten days, with an interest rate of 3% per term, reaching 9% per month.

After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the situation in the concessions was special, and many pawnshop operators did whatever they wanted, shortening the term to two months or one month, with interest rates as high as 50 to 60% per month. They also set up names such as storage rent and commission. Some even calculated compound interest every ten days, and some deducted interest in advance. In short, wherever there was profit, they exhausted all their exploitative abilities. The so-called regulation of people's livelihoods had long become a misnomer. Although restrictions were added after the victory, stipulating a term of two months, interest rates of 27% per month, storage rent of 4%, and handling fee of 15%, totaling 46% for the first month and 31% for the second month. With such high interest rates, the poor could no longer bear the burden. On the pawnshop side, with high interest rates, large expenses, and difficult business operations, how could they relieve the suffering of the people under the oppression of high prices?

### The Appraiser's Expression

When walking into a pawnshop to pawn clothes, one must first observe the expression of the "appraiser" under the high counter. Once an item is sent to the high counter, its value depends on the appraiser's decision. Generally, it is valued at 60% of the original price. Once the price of the goods is determined, it is not easily changed. Even if customers plead repeatedly, it will not move the appraiser's heart, and sometimes it will even be sarcastic or mocking. This is a one-sided transaction. Customers standing under the high counter are like a lamb being slaughtered. Even if they are disappointed and heartbroken, they can only endure it and have no room for bargaining.

Although the appraiser has supreme authority, the responsibility is also heavy. They have keen appraisal abilities and are simply walking encyclopedias. The valuation of clothes is, of course, a given, but even gold, silver, jewelry, watches, cameras, etc., require expertise. Sometimes customers send a very strange item, which must be appraised and valued in the shortest possible time. However, in the past, the most difficult to appraise books, paintings, antiques, are now almost non-existent in pawnshops. On the contrary, Chinese clothes are often valued lower in pawnshops in Hongkou. Women's clothes change styles too quickly. Expired qipaos, in terms of style and season, cannot be sold at a good price.

Initially, the interest earned from selling dead goods was not as high as the interest from redemption, but some money could still be earned, 30 to 40% more than the pawn loan. Later, it became the opposite, not only unable to earn money, but also losing 20 to 30%. This was the most declining period of the pawnshop industry. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, everyone faced economic difficulties and had no money to buy new goods, so the expired old clothes in pawnshops were very popular. In recent years, prices have been rising day and night. The market price of old clothes that have been in the pawnshop for two months is higher than it was two months ago, not to mention that the valuation at that time was only 20 to 30% of the market price. Therefore, the loss from selling dead goods is no longer a concern for pawnshops at present. Even lost goods, the date, material, color, and style of the clothing are recorded, printed, and distributed to each pawnshop in the industry. When the appraiser receives this "Death Warrant," they should check the pawnshop's book to see if there are any identical or similar items. If so, they should be taken out and wait for the police station to take them away for the owner to identify. Each police station has a detective who specializes in running to pawnshops, taking a notebook to inquire at each store. If there is one, they will report it for inspection. If there isn't one, they will stamp a pawnshop's seal on the notebook, called "stamping the seal." If the seal has already been stamped, and the thief confesses that the pawned item is in your pawnshop, the police station will file a lawsuit according to the law. Not only will the pawn loan be confiscated, but there will also be detention and fines. If it is voluntarily handed over, after the owner identifies it, the police station will investigate the pawn loan and award the principal and interest.

In the past, the pawning industry had long cooperated with the police departments of the two concessions, but the French Consul suddenly promulgated pawnshop management regulations, ordering the police department to strictly implement them. It stipulates that pawnshops should verify the name, occupation, and address of the pawner and must find a guarantor. The police department

### Discussing Pawn Tickets

When you bring your clothes to a pawnshop, besides getting a little money, you also get a pawn ticket. This is proof for future redemption. The thin mulberry paper is not only printed vaguely and unclearly, but the items and prices written on it are also like a Daoist's talisman; you can't recognize a single character. It is said that the characters on the pawn ticket are derived from the "Seventeen Calligraphy Posts," mostly only half a character, or unique characters recognized by insiders. These characters are called "pawn script" or "emblem script," which outsiders cannot understand. Not only are the characters on the pawn ticket incomprehensible, but the quality recorded also does not match the original object. Clearly, it is a gold watch, but they always write "broken copper watch." All gold, silver, copper, iron, and other metal items invariably start with the word "broken," and clothes are always marked with "torn and damaged," while leather goods are invariably described as "moth-eaten."

This kind of writing on the pawn ticket is entirely one-sided, fully demonstrating the way landlords dealt with tenant farmers in the past feudal society. However, pawnshop credit is very good, fully possessing the old commercial ethics of China. Even though good items are written as bad ones, they will never be switched out during redemption. But in today's "deteriorating world," that fixed old morality can no longer be maintained. These mysterious symbols allow them to carry out various conspiracies and tricks. In addition to being exploited by high-interest loans, the poor also have to worry about unexpected losses.

### The Outlet for Dead Goods

If an item pledged is not redeemed after the term expires, the interest can be paid to extend the term. If it is neither redeemed nor extended, it is called "dead goods," which the pawnshop sells. Among the goods collected by ordinary pawnshops, clothes are the majority, followed by jewelry. Wooden items and other daily necessities are not accepted by every shop. These dead goods, except for wooden items that are sold through retail, jewelry is exchanged for cash at silver shops, and clothes are assigned to clothing dealers. Many second-hand clothing stores on Stone Road are their main customers. Used clothing is valued the lowest for Western suits and cheongsams. A Western suit is valued at less than 10-20% of the market price, and cheongsams are even cheaper than one-tenth. Because the outlet for Western suits relies only on the used clothing stores on Wusong Road, you can get more money by pawning a Western suit in Hongkou.

### "Stop Pawning, Awaiting Redemption"

In the summer of 1942, the pawn industry in the former French Concession experienced a wave of turmoil. Every pawnshop posted a red paper sign saying "Industry Notice: Stop Pawning, Awaiting Redemption" or "Temporarily Closed." Pawning is closely related to the lives of ordinary citizens. Once pawnshops collectively stop operating, people waiting for rice to cook immediately feel like they have no way out. Although the pawnshops in the former International Settlement were still open, as long as you carried your clothes and walked a bit further, you could still pawn them for some money to buy firewood and rice, but it caused a lot of unrest among the poor.

Pawnshops are places where thieves can sell stolen goods. If clerks are negligent, they inevitably suffer from being cheated for accepting stolen goods. Whenever the police receive a report from the victim, they send personnel to investigate. If the original stolen goods are found, the police department confiscates them directly and punishes the pawnshop owner for receiving stolen goods. The pawn industry considered this method too harsh, with the risk of being punished at any time. So, they all stopped operating, awaiting redemption. This small wave of turmoil lasted for two days. Later, the French Concession authorities agreed to amend the regulations, and it was quelled.

### Municipal Public Pawnshops

The tide of the times is changing. Formal pawnshops can no longer exist, which has only made many black-hearted small pawnshops become more active. The welfare undertaking originally intended to regulate people's livelihoods has been transformed into blood-sucking leeches that exploit with heavy interest. In order to facilitate pawning for the poor and prevent usury, the municipal government established three public pawnshops, greatly benefiting the poor.

Pawning is a social enterprise to help the poor, so it should be run by the public. After the Taiping Rebellion in Shanghai, the city was devastated and the people's livelihoods were declining. So pawnshops were established to regulate the lives of the poor after the disaster. The funds were allocated by the provincial treasury and were public in nature. Later, because public funds were insufficient, local gentry were entrusted to raise funds, and gradually privately-run pawnshops emerged, but they still retained their relief significance. Later, as small pawnshops rose and large pawnshops found it difficult to establish themselves due to the long terms, they turned into sharp knives that exploited the poor, forming a situation where small pawnshops dominated.

The establishment of municipal public pawnshops was proposed in 1935, but it was not established because funds could not be raised. After the victory, Shanghai, after eight years of enemy looting and traitorous extortion, most citizens suffered from severe "dry blood loss." Countless people lived by pawning. Therefore, the public pawnshops that assisted the civilian economy were actually established in an environment of high interest rates, which is a very gratifying thing.

There are three municipal public pawnshops: (1) at the intersection of Fangbang Road and Luxiang Garden Road in Nanshi, (2) at No. 22 Chengdu Road, and (3) at the intersection of Robert Road and Caojiadu. Each was allocated a capital of 3 million yuan from the municipal treasury, and the municipal bank signed overdraft contracts of 10 million yuan with each pawnshop to make their funds particularly sufficient. As for the daily expenses of the public pawnshops, they are allocated by the municipal government, and management is entirely under the Social Affairs Bureau. Public pawnshops stipulate a monthly interest rate of 2%, with no storage or warehousing fees, only a one-time handling fee of 5 cents per yuan. The term is three months, with a grace period of 30 days after the expiration, effectively four months. Initially, the maximum amount for each household was 3,000 yuan, but in today's soaring prices, the amount of 3,000 yuan does not interest the poor. Later, with the approval of the municipal government by the Social Affairs Bureau, it was changed to 10,000 yuan.

When the public pawnshops opened, the interest rates were so low that people couldn't believe it. The poor surged in with their clothes, and the capital of 3 million yuan was completely "exhausted" in a few days. Fortunately, there was an overdraft of 10 million yuan from the municipal bank, otherwise it would have been almost impossible to operate. Most of the things pawned are clothes. According to the regulations of the public pawnshops, uniforms, military uniforms, gold and stone calligraphy and paintings, wooden furniture, title deeds, prohibited items, and rare items that cannot be valued cannot be pawned. If there are suspicious items or items with unknown origins, they can also be refused. Apart from clothes, the poor have nothing else of value, and in the current severe winter weather, even the only broken cotton-padded jacket cannot be taken off and sent to the "Everlasting Storage."

The customers of public pawnshops are mostly workers, vendors, and unemployed poor people. The Caojiadu public pawnshop is located in an industrial area, so most of the people who come to pawn are workers. At the Fangbang Road public pawnshop in Nanshi, vendors account for the first place. The customers of Chengdu Road are unemployed poor people. Comparing the business, Jiajiadu ranks first, Fangbang Road is second, and Chengdu Road is the worst. The loans issued by all three have exceeded the capital of 3 million yuan.

Public pawnshops were originally established for the poor, so the interest rates are set very low. The municipal government prevented unscrupulous small pawnshops from secretly absorbing capital, so it prohibited them from re-pawning the items they had pawned to the public pawnshops. If it is found that the goods are privately re-pawned, in addition to confiscating the items pawned, the Social Affairs Bureau may be requested to recover the price of the items and the interest, and severe punishment will be imposed without leniency.

### Pawnshops Next to Casinos

Gamblers never realize their mistakes when they lose money. When they lose all their gambling money, they will take off their clothes to pawn them for money, hoping to win back their losses, and finally pawn the pawn ticket for money, making a desperate gamble. Therefore, pawnshops near casinos, like venereal disease doctors in red-light districts, are products of adapting to local conditions.

During the enemy-occupied period, the western part of Shanghai, known as a "bad place," was full of casinos. As a result, special pawnshops that facilitated gamblers also sprang up like mushrooms after rain. They mostly had only one storefront, and their customers were naturally mainly gamblers. The clothes pawned were far less than the pawn tickets, and as for gold and silver jewelry, they could be used directly in the casino, so they were rarely seen.

Shanghai's small pawnshops can be considered extremely black-hearted, but the conditions set by pawnshops near casinos are even more outrageous. A pawn ticket normally worth one yuan can only be pawned for ten cents, and the valuation of clothes and other items is even lower than elsewhere. The interest is three cents per dime, with a term of five days. If it is not redeemed, it will be sold.

The interest here is so high that it has reached the extreme (at that time, the general interest rate in Shanghai was very low). At the same time, because the valuation is so low, even if it is not redeemed, selling the items can still bring in a lot of money. The capital is light and the interest is heavy, beyond comparison. It is truly a "man-eating" place. Gamblers are addicted to gambling, refuse to see the error of their ways, pawn things for money, and then lose the money they pawned, and then pawn the pawn tickets. Therefore, pawnshops near casinos are bustling with activity, and their business is really not bad!

### The Inside Story of Redeeming Pledges for Customers

Some small pawnshops in Shanghai, in addition to pawning clothes and goods, also allow you to pawn pawn tickets. "A pawn ticket worth ten yuan can generally be pawned for one yuan, with an interest of three cents per dime, with three cents as a unit, and a term of five days. If it is not redeemed, it will be sold immediately. If the interest is more than nine cents, it is counted as one dime. This harsh condition is appalling. Suppose a pawn ticket with a face value of one yuan is pawned for one dime, and you go to redeem it after five days, it will cost two dimes. Because the pawned dime is counted as three dimes for interest, and the nine cents interest is increased to one dime. At the same time, the numbers on the pawn ticket are originally only 30-40% of the value of the goods, and now it is discounted by another 10%, so even if it is not redeemed, you can always make money. This is called pawnshop in name, but is a black shop in reality.

This way of mortgaging pawn tickets gradually evolved with society, giving rise to a new business of "redeeming pledges for customers." What those who redeem pledges for customers pay attention to are valuable items such as gold and silver jewelry, because the highest that pawnshops accept for these items will not exceed 60% of the original price. When the term expires, if the ticket holder cannot prepare the funds for redemption or pay the interest for extension, isn't he just watching the pawnshop take away his items for only 60% of the price? Redeeming pledges for customers is to act as an intermediary, temporarily paying a sum of money to redeem the items and then obtain some profit from the exchange. On the ticket holder's side, it is also happy to bear.

It is said that redeeming pledges for customers was conceived by the owner of Lu Tianbao Silver Shop on Jinshenfu Road, and those who followed sprang up like mushrooms. Dozens of quasi-silver shops were newly opened, all with redeeming pledges for customers as their only business. Although it is said to be a way of paying funds to earn a few percent for miscellaneous expenses and a few percent for transportation costs, after redeeming the items, a discount is still given on the gold, and the price per tael of gold is always dozens of yuan lower than the market price. At this time, the "sheep has entered the tiger's mouth" and can only cry in vain. They make considerable profits in a turnover. Therefore, those who operate redeeming pledges for customers make at least three times the profit, and the first one has already accumulated tens of thousands of yuan.

Suppose a pawn ticket cannot be traded after being redeemed by a customer due to the price difference. In that case, other remedial measures can be used: (1) Send the redeemed gold jewelry to the pawnshop for pawning again, raising the normal price as high as possible above the original pawn price. The pawn ticket is kept by the shop, and a receipt is issued, stating that the owner will pay the remaining amount on time. If it expires, the shop will redeem it to compensate for the loss. (2) If it is a diamond, pearl, etc., take it to a jewelry store for valuation and set the transaction price. If the shop thinks that the estimated price is questionable, the customer can sell it, and the shop will only take back the original amount after the sale. These complete conditions cannot help but surprise people. Although profit can be made, carrying valuable jewelry and large sums of money back and forth on the road is also somewhat dangerous.

After the rise of the business of redeeming pledges for customers, the clerks in general pawnshops were greatly affected. Originally, the expired goods in the pawnshops were stipulated to be sold by the copper and tin shops and the extraction shops. However, if the price of the goods is lower than the pawn principal, the loss is compensated by the clerk who priced it. However, there is never any loss or compensation for gold and silver jewelry, so the clerk must try to prevent it from being "lost." If it expires and is not redeemed, they can profit from it. Since the trend of redeeming pledges for customers is prevalent, clerks cannot profit from this, so they conspired to retaliate, secretly raising the normal price of jewelry. When redemption merchants come to redeem, they will first state that the goods cannot be re-pawned at the original price after redemption. Therefore, redeeming pledges for customers often encounters "trying to steal a chicken but losing the rice." This scene of clashes between clerks and redemption merchants has allowed the poor who beg for help from the "Everlasting Storage" to reap a little profit.

Redeeming pledges for customers, the former Public Works Bureau believed that it could open up a new way for thieves to sell stolen goods, and issued an order to ban it, so they closed down one after another. However, most of these shops use the business of gold, silver, and jewelry as a cover. The larger ones display various jewelry in the windows, just like silver shops. Although they dare not openly operate, they are still quite active in secret.

There is still a kind that hangs a sign of "×× Trading Company" outside. On the surface, it looks like a second-hand goods shop, but it also operates the business of "buying pawn tickets." For pawn tickets of large pawnshops, where the pawned items are more valuable, such as cameras and fountain pens, they all buy them, and the price they offer is only 20-30% of the pawn ticket. The normal price of these goods is usually 30-40% of the price of the goods. If you add the purchase cost, it only amounts to 50-60% of the price of the goods. After they buy the pawn tickets, they repair the goods slightly or refurbish them, and they can wait for a good price and sell them, making a good profit.

### The Most Magnificent Pawnshop

The poor are spread all over every corner of the world. The pawnshop, known as the "blessing of the common people," exists everywhere and is not a specialty of our country. This most magnificent pawnshop in the world is not in the richest America, nor in the historical Europe, but in the capital of Argentina in South America.

In the center of Buenos Aires, there is a very exquisite five-story building with beautiful windows, neat semi-circular counters, and an orderly layout. The door displays the words Casa de Ventas. People who come to Buenos Aires for the first time will definitely point and ask, is this a department store? In fact, it is a pawnshop managed by the municipal government, which can be said to be the most magnificent pawnshop in the world. In such a large pawnshop, citizens come in and out like they are walking into a bank, dignified and without any shame.

This pawnshop accepts anything and has no limit on loans. It once accepted a diamond as collateral, with a loan amount of 120,000 pesos. It also accepted an airplane, which was later sold for ten yuan. Currently, it has accepted 10,000 sewing machines, 2,500 pianos, and many other items such as telescopes and wedding dresses. As for wedding rings, people are reluctant to pawn them until they are desperate.

At the corner of the building is the valuation room, where people come and go all day long. Citizens enter the valuation room, sit and wait in a small room, and the staff takes the items to be pledged in to the valuator. The original owner of the item and the valuator are not allowed to meet face to face, because they are afraid that they will collude. After the valuation is completed, the pledger leaves with the money, never arguing about more or less, because the price paid is always more than that paid by other private pawnshops.

After the pledged items expire, they are auctioned publicly. Complete sets of tableware, chairs and tables, various radios, typewriters, paintings, and musical instruments are displayed in the windows, with small signs attached, indicating the number and the lowest bid price. If you cannot go to the auction yourself, you only need to pay a handling fee of five cents and a deposit of 20%, and someone will handle it for you. If a customer wants to buy something but does not see it on display, they only need to leave their name and phone number, and they will be notified when the item is for sale. This kind of service spirit is considered meticulous.

They also strive to serve the owners. After the pledged items are sold, the profits are returned to the original owner after deducting the interest due. There are also those who have pledged items and still pay interest on time for more than ten years. There was a woman who pledged a piano for 25 years. Finally, the pawnshop management decided to return it to the original owner. Every year, they also draw lots to return winter clothes and blankets pledged by the poor. This spirit of being loyal and serving the public is truly admirable. People in South America call it a "conscientious pawnshop," which is not an exaggeration.

They have also done many charitable undertakings. In 1938, they funded a hospital to build a tuberculosis sanatorium and outpatient clinic to benefit the poor and sick. In addition, they have loaned money to various cities to help them build roads and repay debts. In 1934, the loan to the Buenos Aires city government totaled 20 million pesos.

Finally, it must be explained. Foreign pawnshops are also located in narrow alleys, mostly dirty and unsightly small shops with disorganized windows. People are reluctant to step into their doors unless they are at their wits' end. The pawnshop in Buenos Aires is an exception.

### Silk Weaving Industry on the Verge of Bankruptcy - Called an Extraordinary Emergency Meeting Yesterday - To Discuss Countermeasures - Loan Interest, Annual Bonuses, and Substitute Weaving Were All Discussed - Representatives Will Be Sent to Petition Various Parties

[Our Newspaper Report] The Shanghai Electrical Silk Weaving Industry Association recently suffered greatly from the exploitation of high-interest loans, as its members had no access to loans. In addition, raw materials and labor are both expensive, but the selling price of products is depressed and does not cover costs. It is currently on the verge of being unable to sustain itself. Yesterday at 1:00 PM, the Association specially held an extraordinary emergency meeting of members at the Kang Le Restaurant to jointly discuss how to deal with countermeasures. Representatives from the Municipal Party Department, Wang Xianqing, and the Social Affairs Bureau, the Shanghai Branch of the Industrial Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and other agencies, as well as members of the Association, totaling 250-260 people, attended. The meeting was presided over by the Association's current Chairman, Cai Xintao, and Standing Director, Liu Qingyi. After the Chairman delivered the opening speech, representatives from various agencies delivered speeches one after another. Finally, three important cases were discussed: (1) Loan issues: Currently, the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank have already provided low-interest loans to the industry. However, the number of members who can borrow is only one-quarter of the total membership. Moreover, it has been found that the loan requires a 70% discount on raw materials and finished products as collateral. However, factories rely on raw materials for production and finished products for sales. Because of the collateral relationship, it is necessary to lock them up in the warehouses of the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank, causing outsiders who do not know the details to think that the factories have no inventory, and they began to demand debts. As a result, obtaining a loan has been forced down by the loan. In the past week, another five or six members have announced liquidation, and the situation is very serious. After discussion, it was decided to appeal to the Standing Committee to improve the loan method. The suggested method is to issue loans of 12 million yuan per weaving machine, with half of the collateral being products and finished products, and the other half being machines. Half of the borrowed funds will be used to repay old high-interest debts, and half will be used to purchase raw materials. It was also decided to send 20 representatives, including Cai Xintao, Liu Qingyi, Song Baolin, Qian Xubao, Tong Xinbo, and Shen Rongfu, to petition the Temporary Loan Committee for Production on the next two days. If it does not work, all 330 members will line up this Wednesday to go to the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Government, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and the Production Loan Committee to petition separately. If it still does not work, the 20 representatives will carry their submissions to Nanjing to petition Chairman Chiang, the National Assembly, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Four Joint Offices. If there is still no result, the industry will have to resort to a complete shutdown, and all of the industry's 20,000 workers will be unemployed. (2) Annual bonus issue: Recently, the Municipal Government held a meeting to discuss the annual bonus method for piecework wages, and decided to continue to handle it according to the past situation. As far as the situation in the silk weaving industry is concerned, there has been no annual bonus practice in the past. Moreover, the situation this year is special. Members have no way to apply for loans and no profits to speak of. Moreover, the average monthly income of silk weaving workers is more than 300,000 yuan per person. If each person is to be given an annual bonus for one month, the total burden that all members must spend for the annual bonus will be between 3 and 4 billion yuan. In the case of a larger factory with 300 workers, it will have to bear a huge amount of 100 million yuan. In this time of desperation, where can there be extra strength to pay this additional burden? Therefore, it was decided to submit the actual situation to the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau for their records. (3) Substitute weaving of silk fabrics: Currently, the government's purchase of raw silk is costly, and due to competition with Japanese silk, it is difficult to export and must suffer losses. In view of this, the silk weaving industry has specially requested the authorities to hand over the batch of purchased raw silk to the silk weaving industry association's member factories for substitute weaving of silk fabrics. Because Chinese silk fabrics have better sales in the international market and the selling price is also better than raw silk. It is estimated that the foreign exchange obtained from exporting and selling silk fabrics after weaving can be doubled compared to raw silk. The relevant authorities have now agreed in principle and decided to promote its realization. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.

### Financial Industry Trends - General Business is Not Bad - Will Not Use Dime and Cent Units - Year-End Bonuses According to Precedent

[Our Newspaper Report] Financial circles news: A larger bank in the city is seeking the consent of other banks to stop using dime and cent units on accounting books from New Year's Day next year. It is said that after most banks agree, the suggestion will be submitted to the Banking Association and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval. According to a banking expert, the unit below one yuan has no other use except for paying direct taxes. Auxiliary coins are, in fact, no longer an effective payment instrument today. If the unit of dime and cent can be omitted from the bank's accounting books, it can save a lot of energy for service personnel. However, this matter must be implemented after the approval of the Ministry of Finance. It is also said that the business situation of general banks in the city this year is not bad, but the Sichuan banks are not familiar with the situation in Shanghai, so they have suffered bad debts, but it will not be a big problem. The year-end bonuses of the banking industry have precedents to follow and will not cause new disputes. Over the past year, labor disputes have inevitably occurred in the banking industry, but they have been resolved on their own before they escalated.

### Silk for Silk - Agreed in Principle - Processing Plan Undecided

[Our Newspaper Report] Silk factories in this city are negotiating with the China Trust Bureau to discuss detailed methods of exchanging silk for silk. According to relevant sources, the government has agreed in principle to supply low-priced raw silk to cooperating factories and recover the finished silk fabrics for overseas distribution. This matter is also beneficial to the government, because the government can only obtain 800 US dollars of foreign exchange for the export of one dan of raw silk, but if one dan of raw silk is woven into silk fabrics for export, the government can obtain 1,200 US dollars of foreign exchange. Comparing the two, it is obviously beneficial. However, having the state supply the cooperating silk factories with raw materials and recovering the silk fabrics after weaving involves very complex issues, including organization, division of labor, and joint industry. A dedicated institution must be set up to handle it in an orderly manner. Therefore, this matter requires the silk factories to propose a detailed and feasible plan and program as the basis for negotiation. Moreover, if the silk factories can obtain a supply of low-priced raw silk, their products do not have to be sold exclusively to the United States, because the price of silk fabrics in Southeast Asia and India is far higher than that in the United States.

### Coal Briquette Supply and Demand Issues: Fuel Management Committee Strives to Regulate, Demand Surges Beyond Budget, Unclogging Sources and Increasing Raw Material Allocation

[Report from this newspaper] A certain responsible person from the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs told our reporter that the supply and demand situation of white coal dust, the raw material for coal briquettes in this city, has been quite normal. In the previous few months, an estimated four to five thousand tons per month were sufficient to meet the demand. Unexpectedly, in recent months, the demand has suddenly surged to more than ten thousand tons. Therefore, the Committee's original plan of sixty thousand tons of white coal dust being sufficient for the entire city for a year has now been shattered. It is said that the main consumers of white coal dust are machine-made coal briquette businesses. Because the market price of white coal dust in both this city and other areas has risen sharply, the white coal dust allocated by the authorities may be resold for profit, which will affect the quality of coal briquettes and their normal production volume. It is reported that the Fuel Management Committee has a contract with Vietnam to purchase 100,000 tons of white coal dust, which the Committee regularly sends ships to transport. Recently, due to the outbreak of war in Hanoi and Haiphong in Vietnam, the normal transportation volume has been affected. Fortunately, the Committee still has considerable reserves in this city, which are sufficient to meet temporary needs. In addition, it has been decided to allocate 2,000 tons each of small white coal blocks and semi-smokeless coal, crush them into dust, and allocate them to machine-made coal briquette businesses to manufacture coal briquettes, which will then be sold by coal briquette retailers. It is also reported that recently, 18,000 tons of white coal are expected to arrive continuously from Vietnam, which will be transported by the Yunitae, Niger Maru, and Tangier vessels respectively. Among them, the Yunitae ship, loaded with more than 5,500 tons of white coal, set sail from Vietnam on the 6th, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 18th.

### Import and Export Industry: Discussion of Quotas

Compilation of Statistics for Reference

[Report from this newspaper] The Import and Export Industry Association is holding a series of panel meetings this week. In addition to the cotton panel and the pigment panel, which have already been held, the industrial raw materials panel, the rubber panel, the hardware panel, etc., will be convened soon. Statistical figures will be compiled for the past imports and current actual demand for the above-mentioned important imports, which will be used as a basis for the government to determine quotas. The investigation forms for cotton demand are still being collected, and the statistical work has not yet been completed.

### Increased Demand for American Cotton

[Reuters, New York, 14th] China, India, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the United Nations are all interested in purchasing cotton. A certain well-known spot trading firm has accepted orders from France for approximately 7,000 bales. It is rumored that the relevant parties are currently in negotiations to establish a government-supported management bank to restore private company funding for cotton exports. It is also said that the Commodity Credit Corporation recently accepted a Japanese order for 367,000 bales of American cotton, to be delivered in 1947. The above rumors have attracted considerable attention from the cotton industry.

### First Batch of Japanese Yarn to Arrive in Hong Kong at the End of the Month

[Hong Kong, 14th] The first batch of 5,500 bales of Japanese cotton yarn will arrive in Hong Kong at the end of the month and will be distributed to various textile factories for use. The textile industry, which was on the verge of collapse, has been revitalized. Factories that had previously closed have now resumed operations one after another, and the ban on the export of cotton textiles is expected to be lifted.

### RMB 1 Billion Zhejiang Province Fishing Loan: China Farmers Bank Has Decided on Four Principles

Qu Qu Sheng, representative of the joint office of the National Fisheries and Vegetables Corporation and supervisor of the Zhejiang Fisheries Construction Association, went to Beijing for the second time yesterday to negotiate the matter of the RMB 1 billion Zhejiang Province fishing loan approved by Chairman Chiang of the National Government. It is now learned that the China Farmers Bank's board of directors has internally decided on four principles for the aforementioned RMB 1 billion fishing loan: (1) Focus on the coastal areas of Zhejiang, (2) Provide direct loans to fishermen, (3) The provincial government and the commissioner's offices and county governments in the localities will act as guarantors, and (4) The cooperative societies in various places and the director of the Provincial Fisheries Administration will act as supervisors. The China Farmers Bank authorities have also compiled the records and allocated amounts from the Ningbo-area fishing loan distribution meeting and submitted them to the Joint Treasury for approval. Once approved, the Zhejiang Province branch will be instructed to provide loans nearby. However, Representative Zhao stated that various localities have high hopes for the aforementioned fishing loan, so he personally requested the China Farmers Bank authorities to expedite the process, and it may be issued around the end of this month. The flight of speculative capital and remittances from overseas Chinese to Hong Kong has created unprecedented financial activity. American banks (American Express), (Citibank), and (Chase) are aggressively providing loans in a speculative manner. This matter has attracted the attention of British banks, and they may resume lending in the short term to compete with American banks.

### Industrial and Commercial Recession: Machine Factories Hit Hard, Half Are in a State of Stagnation

Yesterday, a responsible person from the Machinery Industry Association told reporters: In the current state of overall industrial and commercial recession, the machinery industry has been hit the hardest. Currently, there are more than 700 machine factories in this city that have joined the Association. More than 90% of them cannot sustain themselves. For the past few months, there has been a phenomenon of bankruptcies every month, and to date, no less than dozens of them have closed. Even those who are barely surviving have 50% of their operations in a state of stagnation. None of them are operating at full capacity. Factories that used to have three to four hundred workers before the war are now only maintaining the remnants with seventy to eighty workers. There is no production of complete machines; they are only manufacturing machine parts or providing machinery repair services for factories as their business scope. Factories that are relatively more sustainable are those that produce textile machinery, fiber machinery, and machine tools, because the textile industry in Shanghai is relatively developed. One-quarter of the industry, 200 factories, has applied to the government for industrial loans, totaling RMB 5.1 billion. Although the government has agreed to consider it, there has been no concrete decision to date. Even if the loans are approved, they can only help a portion of the machine factories. Therefore, the machinery industry is truly on the verge of imminent danger.

### Governor of Macau: Issues New Subsidiary Currency, Scheduled for Use on New Year's Day Next Year

[Special dispatch from this newspaper in Macau] Recently, Macau's subsidiary currency has been worn out and in short supply, and the market circulation has been sluggish, causing merchants to suffer. In response to the merchants' request, the Macau government petitioned Lisbon for approval to issue new currency. According to the official gazette published by the Macau government yesterday, the Finance Department of the Portuguese colony recently approved the printing of 3.01 million yuan of new subsidiary currency for Macau, to be issued by the Governor of Macau. The new currency is expected to be issued around January 1st of next year.

### Fishermen's Children are Poor for Generations: A Picture of the Miserable Condition of Fishermen, Family Property Gone, Tools Destroyed, Oppressed by High Interest Rates, Living in Dire Poverty: Tang Kexiang Reports After Returning to Shanghai from Inspection

The China Farmers Bank, in order to revitalize China's fishing industry and launch large-scale fishing loans, previously sent personnel directly to the coastal areas of Hebei and Shandong provinces to conduct on-the-spot inspections of the conditions in fishing villages. At that time, the Joint Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and representatives from various sectors of the fishing industry were invited, spending a total of three weeks, passing through Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Dagu, and Qingdao. According to Tang Kexiang, director of the loan department of the bank, who participated in the previous inspection, China's fish-producing areas in North China are most abundant in Hebei Province, which was estimated to have an annual output of more than 100 billion yuan before the war, and Shandong Province, which had an output of 600 to 700 million yuan. Such a large income can invigorate the rural economy and enrich the national treasury, which is of great benefit. Before the victory, they were oppressed by the Japanese and could not develop fully. After the war, everything was waiting to be rebuilt. The Joint Relief and Rehabilitation Administration even allowed the use of construction materials to assist our country, which is a rare opportunity for the recovery of the fishing industry. It is learned that the Joint Relief and Rehabilitation Administration plans to provide more than 120 fishing vessels, of which 34 have already been shipped. In addition, all the materials for fishing boats will be supplied, which can be used to build 10,000 fishing boats and distributed to various sectors. The fishing boats are aimed at fishermen, while the fishing vessels are managed by fishing companies. Tang continued, the thing that fishermen feel most lacking is production tools, because fishing boats and fishing nets were severely damaged during the war and they were unable to replenish them. For example, in more than a dozen fishing villages near Tianjin, the tools that were destroyed accounted for more than 50%. In the Qingdao area, five fishing villages also accounted for more than 30%. The family property of the fishermen was gone, and they had to work as laborers, swimming in the seabed to collect kelp in exchange for meager wages. Before entering the sea, they must drink a little sorghum wine. After coming out of the water, their bellies are as big as drums, and they must vomit forcefully several times a day before they can eat. The suffering is unbearable to witness. In addition, there is a lack of climate measurement and reporting at sea. They rely entirely on experience to deal with changes in ocean currents. Once there is an accident, their lives have no guarantee. The issue of maritime security is also extremely important. The presence of pirates has a significant impact on production. The above points are all reasons for the downturn in the fishing industry. The hierarchy of the fishing industry starts from the fishermen, fishmongers, ice and fresh boats, fish markets, fish vendors, and finally to fish stalls. Among them, fishmongers and fish markets have the closest relationship with fishermen, and the exploitation of fishermen is also the most severe. In fishing villages, high-interest loans are also rampant. The degree of harm is even greater than in Shanghai. For example, when fishermen lack funds to purchase fishing gear, the above-mentioned institutions will provide a sum of cash. When it comes to paying back the principal and interest, cash is never used. Instead, it is replaced by the treasures obtained by the fishermen every day. In this way, the lending institutions buy fresh goods at low prices every day, paying very little compensation, and also deduct weight to repay debts, which is endless, and many are not paid off for several generations. The saying "Fishermen's children are poor for generations" is truly a realistic description. Tang concluded by saying that the bank is aware of this, and before launching fishing loans, it is necessary to eradicate this bad habit, starting from the self-reliance of the fishermen and aiming at self-transportation and self-sales, that is, loans should be aimed directly at the fishermen, going deep into the fishing villages, first establishing fishing associations in various places, electing chairmen, gathering fishermen as members, and having the chairmen take responsibility for leadership. The above-mentioned organization is best developed in Qingdao, and relatively slow in Tianjin, because the former has more popular education in fishing villages.

### Qinhuangdao and Qingdao: Foreign Vessels Temporarily Not Allowed to Reside: Customs Receives Telegram from President Song, Notifying Chinese and Foreign Shipping Merchants

The Jianghai Customs recently received a telegram from President Song stating that foreign ships are temporarily not allowed to sail to the ports of Qinhuangdao and Qingdao. Liu Bingyi, the Customs Commissioner, specifically notified the shipping merchants to be informed. The original text is as follows: "It has been found that the ports of Qinhuangdao, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, Kowloon, Gongbei, Jiangmen, and Leizhou were previously ordered to temporarily allow foreign ships to go to trade and trade, and were announced to the public in Announcement No. 14 to No. 20. Now, it has been ordered by the government that foreign ships will be temporarily suspended from going to the ports of Qinhuangdao and Qingdao for trade and trade. From now on, foreign ships will be temporarily not allowed to go to the two ports for trade and trade, except for those specially permitted by the government."

International Economy

### The United States is Also Experiencing Inflation

— (Translated by the Editorial Department of this Newspaper from the New York Morning Post)

I. Observations on Current Prices

Prices Rise Across the Board, Especially for Clothing and Food

Although most people predicted that prices in the United States would fall, a new round of inflation has occurred in the past week. The cost of living for the average citizen has not only not decreased, but is also continuing to rise. In the first week after the authorities announced the lifting of price controls, everyone was talking about prices trending downward, but the reality is that all prices are still fluctuating. Perhaps this is the "last burst" of inflation, but it has already reached its peak.

In September of this year, the cost of living in the United States was 46% higher than the average cost of living from 1935 to 1939. Although the authorities have not yet announced the exact figures, the upward trend in the future may reach 50% higher than before the war. The cost of living in New York is higher than in other places, and the rate of increase is also greater. At the beginning of this year, the cost of living in New York was 2.5% higher than the national average, but currently it is 3.5% higher than the national average. Only rent has increased the least, slightly suppressing the cost of living. Rent is less than 2% higher than in 1939; fuel and other housing costs are 19% higher; but food is 90% higher than in 1939; clothing is 85% higher; and furniture is 70% higher. The above figures do not include the recent price increases. In the first two days after the announcement of the lifting of price controls, the prices of 28 major commodities rose by 7.4%. The most severe increases were in hardware, scrap iron, and chemical raw materials. The prices of rayon fabrics, raw wool, and carpets have all risen. Various machines and radios produced by major factories have reached new highs, rising 60% compared to the previous week. General Electric's washing machines soared 30% overnight. Other items such as automobiles and agricultural implements have all been affected by inflation.

There are very few varieties of goods that have fallen in price, and the most significant is the fluctuating price of cotton. Fur goods have fallen in price by 30% to 50% since this spring. Other goods that have fallen in price include the following: women's wool sweaters, men's sportswear, handkerchiefs, and certain brands of lesser-known radios.

As a result of high prices, the cost of living has exceeded workers' wages. In January 1946, the average weekly wage was $41.15, which increased to $45.10 in September of the same year, but it is far behind the rapidly increasing cost of living!

Another result of inflation is the sharp reduction in savings rates. In 1944, the national people of the United States could save $39 billion annually, in 1945, overseas Chinese businessmen saved $35 billion, but in 1946, the total national savings decreased to $17 billion. This means that many Americans have no savings at all, and some have even exhausted their resources and are heavily in debt.

II. Outlook on Future Prices

The Trend is Still Rising, Life is Becoming Difficult

In the coming months, many essential commodities in high demand will inevitably rise in price again. Here is an estimate: The latest outlook for food prices is that they will increase compared to last week. The prices of meat, butter, and eggs are already rising. From a long-term perspective, your food bills in 1947 may have no hope of decreasing, and if there is any decrease, it will only fluctuate slightly with the seasons. Regarding clothing, except for rayon, it is generally accepted that the prices of other goods have already risen enough. There will be discounts and clearance sales after Christmas. Next spring, especially for women's clothing, prices will gradually decline. Even men's clothing is weak and sluggish, and several types of suits and shirts have already been reduced in price.

However, the prices of household goods, which are in the most urgent demand, will increase. It is estimated that the price of so-called cheap furniture will soon increase by 30%. The biggest obstacle in the process of furniture price increases is reducing production. Most people will not be able to afford such high prices.

Among the major automobile manufacturers, only General Motors has increased the prices of its products. Other companies say that they will not increase prices if the prices of raw materials do not increase. However, the prices of raw materials have been increasing since then.

The high prices of rent and construction are the biggest threat to the cost of living today. The Office of Price Administration is currently considering the owners' request to increase rent by 15%, and the submission also stipulates a method for gradually lifting the rent control system. Regarding housing, the government spokesman no longer believes that the current price of a new house for veterans is possible at $10,000. The price of a standard six-room wood-frame house has risen to $13,000. If there is a decrease in housing prices in the future, it will definitely start with older and larger houses. Small houses will still be in urgent demand and sold at high prices, at least until 1948.

### Ministry of Education Promotes Electro-Optical Education: Formulates Educational Film Circulation Methods: 20 Schools in Beijing Designated to Set Up Screening Stations

[Report from this newspaper in Nanjing on the 15th] The Ministry of Education has formulated educational film circulation methods, the main points of which are to circulate educational films to expand the effectiveness of education. Educational films are sent by the Ministry to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities for distribution to electro-optical education implementation institutions for application. The number of films sent each time is determined by the Ministry. The education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities should instruct the implementing personnel to properly protect the films. If there is a break in the film, it should be glued together in time. After the screening, it should be cleaned with carbon tetrachloride. It is stipulated that April, August, and December of each year are the film exchange periods. The education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities should return the old films on time and exchange them for new films. The returned films should be complete with the reel box, the film body should be clean, and the length should not be shortened. If the application agency needs to continue screening, it should report the film catalog for verification, but the accumulation should not exceed 30 copies. Those who have not returned the film after receiving the film and have not reported the film catalog shall not exceed 10 copies, and the time shall not exceed one month. Educational institutions and other cultural groups near the Ministry of Education that need to borrow educational films shall also not exceed 10 copies each time, and the time shall also not exceed one month.

Ministry of Education and Jinling University Co-operate on Film and Broadcasting Journal

### Another Henan Farce: Funds for Military Grain in Fangcheng County Disappear for a Second Time; Greed Overwhelms Reason, Suspects Re-offend

— Special Dispatch from Kaifeng on the 7th, by Our Reporter in Bian, Wang Shoumei

This year has truly been a year of corruption. In murky waters, both high and low officials have discarded their service ethics, and everyone is scheming to exploit their positions for personal gain. The slogans of "purifying officialdom" and "eradicating corruption" have long been drowned out by the clamor of corruption and malfeasance. Demons dance wildly; the official arena this year is filled with dark and ominous miasma! As the year draws to a close, our hearts are filled with sorrow and anxiety. We wish we could tear away these remaining pages of the old year and usher in a bright tomorrow, so that our pens would no longer have to depict such dirty and ugly farces in the officialdom as we have this year, but instead could use vibrant colors to paint a picture of brightness. We are waiting, we are hoping! However, in reality, we cannot put down our pens and ignore the dirty reality. Now I am still holding my pen, with a painful heart, to write the second act of the Henan farce for our readers. This may be the final act, as the year ends and the month is over, and the "Year of Corruption" is almost over.

Everyone Loves Military Grain Funds; Ignoring Past Mistakes, They Only Seek Profit

The Fangcheng County military grain funds embezzlement case, which caused a sensation in Henan, including the temporary currency transactions and the dismissal and detention of the main character Zhao Zuo'an and the supporting actor Fan Zuomin, has already been reported in detail to our readers by this reporter on the 25th of last month. After the arrest of Zhao, Fan, and other accomplices, the public has been watching how the government will punish Zhao. Unexpectedly, the military grain funds that were squeezed out of the thieves' mouths disappeared again on their way to Fangcheng. Top officials in the province, such as the Director of Finance Fan Zuomin and the Magistrate of Fangcheng County Zhao Zuo'an, were dismissed and detained because of this case, yet someone still dared to set their sights on these funds and use them privately for business ventures. One can only imagine how ruthless and audacious this person is. The decline of service ethics among civil servants to this point is truly astonishing! Therefore, it is indeed true that this case is filled with dramatic tension. The reason for this is that out of the 129 million yuan of military grain funds in Fangcheng County, besides the 19 million yuan privately withdrawn by Xue Binqing for illegal business operations, the remaining 110 million yuan that Fan Zuomin had manipulated was pursued by Sun Luzhan, the secretary of the Fangcheng County Council, Zhu Wenbin, the former director of the Grain and Field Department, and Yuan Ziyu, a member of the Youth League, who went to the provincial capital to investigate. Fan Zuomin, in a flurry of activity, arranged for the Provincial Bank to remit 80 million yuan to Xuchang and 10 million yuan each to Xiangxian and Yexian. The remaining 10 million yuan, along with the deposit slips from the Xuchang, Xiang, and Ye branches, were handed over by Fan Zuomin to the representatives Sun Luzhan and others to take back. In theory, Sun and others should have taken the collection procedures from each branch back to Fangcheng to report, and the county should have sent people to the branches to withdraw the money. However, they did not fully follow this procedure; otherwise, the second act of this ugly drama would not have been presented to the readers. Seeing that the military grain funds had already been remitted, Sun Luzhan and others set out to return home. At this time, the case had already caused a stir, and they knew that County Magistrate Zhao Zuo'an had been dismissed. The new magistrate had just arrived, and there would naturally be a period of transition. When they passed through Xuchang, they handed the 80 million yuan check remitted to the Xuchang branch to Sun Lingyun, the director of the accounting department of the Xuchang branch (who is Sun Luzhan's nephew). Except for Sun Luzhan who stayed in Xuchang, Zhu and Yuan returned. As soon as they left, County Magistrate Zhao Zuo'an was detained and escorted to the provincial capital. On the day County Magistrate Zhao was escorted through Xuchang (October 9th), Sun Lingyun withdrew all 80 million yuan and temporarily deposited it in the name of Yuji as a Class A current deposit. Then, he lent 5 million yuan at 10% interest to the Yilicheng Tea House in Xuchang, ... 2 million ... company ... 1 million, and hoarded 20 million yuan of tobacco leaves in the salt and tobacco ... Sun Lingyun kept the remaining 10 million yuan for himself. This trick was done secretly, without anyone knowing. The uncle and nephew were quite pleased with themselves.

Sun Luzhan Detained and Escorted to the Province; 50 Million Yuan in Cash Recovered

On October 23rd, Sun Luzhan returned to Fangcheng, but to his surprise, County Magistrate Wang Jingxiu sent representatives Yuan Ziyu and others to Xuchang on October 25th to collect the money. He was very alarmed and anxious, and on October 29th, he hurriedly went to Xuchang and pleaded with Yuan Ziyu and others in every possible way, asking them not to publicize the matter. After discussing with Yuan and others, Sun Luzhan drafted a telegram for Yuan to send to County Magistrate Wang, stating that the funds were not yet due and requesting County Magistrate Wang to allow them to bring back the original loan receipt, attempting to delay the pursuit. After the telegram was sent, Sun rushed back to the county on November 1st to make arrangements. That evening, he visited County Magistrate Wang... requested County Magistrate Wang to verbally agree, but used the excuse that it was after working hours and the drafting staff were not available to send a reply telegram. At the same time, he secretly telegraphed the provincial government about the second disappearance of the military grain funds and sent people to safely recover 10 million yuan each from Xiangxian and Yexian. He also strictly pursued the 80 million yuan in Xuchang. Before long, he received an order from the provincial government to escort the relevant criminals to the provincial capital. At this point, Sun Luzhan was detained and escorted to Kaifeng, and Sun Lingyun was also dismissed and detained and is currently on his way to the provincial capital. It is said that only 55 million yuan in cash has been recovered from the 80 million yuan in military grain funds, and the remaining 25 million yuan was used to offset tobacco leaves and paper...

After Sun Luzhan was escorted to the province, he was detained. It is said that he was interrogated once and claimed that Zhu Wenbin gave the withdrawal slip to Sun Lingyun, and he knew nothing about the fraudulent activities. However, Zhu Wenbin claimed that he knew nothing at all, and Yuan Ziyu also did not know. The collusion and fraud were only understood by the Sun uncle and nephew.

### Construction of New Sichuan's New Education: A Conversation with Director Liu Mingyang

— Special Dispatch from Chengdu on the 7th, by Our Reporter in Rong, Zhou Xueduan

Sichuan Province has long been known for its developed education system. Since Wen Weng governed Shu during the Han Dynasty, he widely promoted education, established schools, and promoted culture and education, greatly opening up the atmosphere of Shu. The prosperity of Shu education at that time was comparable to that of Qi and Lu. After more than two thousand years of development, Sichuan education has always held a leading position among the western provinces of China. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the central government moved westward, and universities from all over the country moved to Sichuan one after another. Sichuan's education flourished for a time, becoming the center of national culture and education. After the victory, education was restored. The current situation of Sichuan education after the restoration has attracted the attention of people from all over the country. To this end, the reporter specially visited Mr. Liu Mingyang, the Director of the Department of Education of Sichuan Province, for a long conversation. Mr. Liu comprehensively discussed the current situation of Sichuan's education after the restoration and the future educational work policies in detail, providing reference for the education community.

Sichuan Education Since the Restoration

First, talking about the current situation of Sichuan's education, starting from three stages: Before the war, Sichuan's education had quantity but no quality. Although there were three universities, Sichuan University, West China University, and Chongqing University, higher education was limited by funding and the quality was very poor. Secondary education was more common, but social and national education were not very developed. This was the initial stage of Sichuan's education. During the war, universities from all over the country moved inland. At its peak, Sichuan had a total of 28 universities. For example, Chongqing had five universities, including the Central Political School, Central University, Fudan University, and Zhonghua University. Leshan had Wuhan University and the Central Vocational School. Santai had Northeastern University. Xuyong had the Southwest Associated University Graduate School. Wanxian had Shanghai Law School. Jiangjin had the Women's Normal College, etc. Chengdu at that time had nine universities, including Sichuan University, West China University, Qilu University, Yenching University, Ginling University, Guanghua University, Ginling Women's University, the Medical College of Central University, and Sichuan-Kang Agricultural and Industrial College, known as the national cultural city. At the same time, secondary, social, and national education also progressed rapidly in response to the needs of the times and reality. This was the prosperous period of Sichuan's education. After the victory, schools were restored. Sichuan's education declined from the wartime prosperity, but due to the deeply rooted foundation of Sichuan's education in the past, and the support and efforts of the central and local governments since the War of Resistance, Sichuan's education entered the third stage, that is, the current period of development. According to the statistics of this year, the current situation of Sichuan's education is as follows: Higher education: a total of 13 schools above the junior college level, including 4 universities, 3 independent colleges, and 6 junior colleges. The distribution includes National Sichuan University (President Huang Jilu) in Chengdu, Private West China University (President Fang Shu), Chengdu China University (formerly Guanghua University reorganized, President Wang Zhaorong), and Sichuan-Kang Agricultural and Industrial College (President Wei Shizhen), and three provincial-level vocational schools of accounting, sports, and art. Chongqing has National Chongqing University (President Zhang Hongyuan), Provincial Education College (President Yan Yu), and National Central Industrial College. Jiangjin has National Women's Normal College (President Xie Fuchu). Leshan has National Central Vocational School. Zigong has National Zigong Industrial College, etc., with a total of 12,000 students. Secondary education: There are currently 711 middle schools in Sichuan, including 8 national middle schools, 546 public and private ordinary middle schools, 85 normal schools, and 72 vocational schools, with a total of 233,269 students. Social education: There are a total of 1 provincial-level and 156 county and municipal-level public education centers in Sichuan, 1 provincial-level and 79 county and municipal-level libraries, and 26 private libraries. National education: There are currently 2,733 complete primary schools and 23,520 national schools in Sichuan, with 3,824,843 children enrolled, accounting for more than 80% of the school-age children in Sichuan. Judging from the above overall situation, Sichuan's education at the current stage is obviously in the process of development and advancement.

Overcoming Difficulties and Seeking Improvement

When talking about the implementation of Sichuan's educational work, the provincial government and education authorities believe that although the achievements are hard-won, they also believe that the current construction of Sichuan's education has not yet reached the ideal state. As the head of the education authority, Mr. Liu deeply sighed that there are still many thorns and difficulties on the road to fully achieving the ideal education in Sichuan. According to the discussion, the biggest difficulties in promoting Sichuan's education at present are: first, insufficient funding, and second, unhealthy social atmosphere. Regarding the issue of funding, the current financial situation in Sichuan is generally difficult. This year, the province's budget revenue and expenditure shortfall is 11.9 billion, while the total revenue of Sichuan's budget in 1947 is only 9.7 billion, and the expenditure will reach 34.7 billion, a difference of 25 billion. In such a struggling financial environment, education funding is like pouring a cup of water on a cartload of firewood, and it is difficult to talk about expansion. Regarding the issue of the social atmosphere, Sichuan's past education was not of good quality. During the war, higher education was actively rectified, but secondary education and below, under the special social environment of Sichuan during the War of Resistance, unhealthy social trends entered the schools. Teachers' lives were difficult, and the methods of management and teaching were inadequate. As a result, some students were influenced by society and infected by the environment, and their behavior was inevitably dissolute. Some were undisciplined, and others violated the law. At present, it is quite difficult to reverse this accumulated situation. For example, several bloodshed incidents occurred in Chengdu this week, and middle school students accounted for two of them. One was a student stabbing another student due to a dispute between the old and new principals of the private Chengcheng Middle School, and the other was a student at West China Middle School shooting a classmate. The general public believes that the current school atmosphere in Sichuan's middle schools has reached an extreme point. Mr. Liu believes that this is the biggest hidden worry for Sichuan's education at present. Therefore, the main work of the Sichuan Provincial Education Bureau at present is to focus on these two difficult problems and strive for solutions and improvements. How to solve the difficulties and improve the shortcomings, Mr. Liu talked about the two major active tasks of the current education authorities: first, to find ways to increase funding, and second, to thoroughly improve the social atmosphere:

Regarding the former, in order to cooperate with Sichuan's educational construction plan, such as expanding higher education, enriching secondary education, and popularizing social and national education, the higher education part is requesting the central government to provide as much subsidies as possible. The remaining part, within the financial capacity of the province, is requesting the provincial government to increase funding as much as possible. In addition, it is also advocating schools to create property and strive to increase revenue and reduce expenditure.

Regarding the latter, Mr. Liu revealed the five major guidelines for educational work as soon as he took office in March of this year: (1) Democratization, (2) Disciplinarization, (3) Integrity, (4) Scientification, (5) Labor Productionization, that is, (1) adopting a democratic style of running schools, making everything open internally and externally, and fostering a spirit of mutual trust and love between teachers and students. (2) Teachers abide by the teacher's ethics, and students strictly abide by discipline, cultivating a habit of mutual respect and self-love. (3) Those who handle education work should be absolutely honest and the finances should be absolutely open, in order to set an example and be a model for society. (4) Education should adapt to needs to cultivate scientific talents, encourage students to pay attention to and society to value science, and promote the use of scientific methods in scholarship and management. (5) Encourage students to participate in labor and engage in production, so that they can become self-reliant through their own efforts. The purpose of these five points is to cultivate the ability of all students in Sichuan to have self-study, self-reliance, self-governance, and self-love. For several months, the Department of Education has used these five points as the educational guidelines and promoted them in all major middle schools in Sichuan, with remarkable results. Mr. Liu believes that if the essence of the five points can be thoroughly implemented, the school's academic atmosphere will naturally improve, and the educational atmosphere will naturally change. And he firmly stated that the removal of the first difficulty is in the hands of the central government and the provincial government, and the improvement of the second shortcoming is the unshirkable responsibility of the Department of Education. The former must be strived for, and the latter must be determined to be thoroughly completed in a short period of time.

Grasping the Guidelines and Cultivating Talents

Finally, when talking about the future development direction and plan of Sichuan's education, Mr. Liu believed that according to his own opinion, after the National Assembly, the national constitution was completed, and the work of nation-building began. The national construction policy should implement three major policies under the highest principle of the Three People's Principles: (1) Political Democratization, (2) Economic Socialization, (3) Cultural Education Scientification. The national government has returned to the capital, and the central government has clearly designated Sichuan as a construction experimental zone. When President Chiang bid farewell to all the elders in Sichuan, he repeatedly stated that the funding and talents for Sichuan's construction in the future will be the first in the country. The central direction of Sichuan's education in the future should be to respect the President's intentions, cooperate with practical needs, and aim to cultivate construction talents for the new Sichuan. The main directions of education in the future should be two points: (1) Enriching and expanding higher education: The purpose is to cultivate high-level talents for Sichuan's construction. The provincial government has formulated a plan to prepare to add five provincial universities in western Sichuan, central Sichuan, northern Sichuan, eastern Sichuan, and southern Sichuan, and in line with the needs of the main industries and special production talents in Sichuan's construction, add vocational schools in each of the sixteen administrative regions. (2) Popularizing secondary, social, and national education: The purpose is to reserve cadre talents for Sichuan's construction. According to the current statistics in Sichuan, the total population is 47,547,120 people, the number of uneducated adults is 6,740,217 people, the number of enrolled people is 2,793,184 people, and the number of illiterate people is more than 6 million, which is a great obstacle to national construction. In the future, Sichuan's new education should focus on popularizing education below the secondary level, rescuing uneducated illiterates, and massively reserving basic cadres for construction. The main purpose of the two major directions is to complete the scientification of Sichuan's education. This is the characteristic of the new education for building a new Sichuan.

### Opium Addiction: Must Be Stopped Quickly and Severely

— By Cha Liangjian

Sichuan was the leading province in the War of Resistance, striving for national victory, and is now a model area for national construction. Sichuan's education has undergone more than 30 years of arduous management, from enlightenment to prosperity to the current period of development. After a long and frank conversation with a senior senator and veteran educator in Sichuan, from his firm belief, I believe that he will be able to overcome all difficulties, promote existing achievements, and fulfill the great mission of building a new Sichuan by building Sichuan's education.

The scourge of opium addiction is extremely tragic. As Lin Wen-zhong (Commissioner Lin) once lamented, everyone knows, and there is no need to repeat it. The state, in order to eradicate this poison as soon as possible, does not hesitate to use severe punishments to prohibit it, with the intention of stopping it by force, so that there will be no need for punishment in the end, and to advance our entire nation to a state of prosperity and happiness as soon as possible. This is very obvious.

Today, although the laws are strict and the orders are solemn, those who commit crimes in the corner of Shanghai are still commonly seen. This is because they have been trapped by the enemy for a long time, forced by the enemy and puppet's threats and inducements, and spread the poison far and wide. And the ignorant opium addicts, indulging in it without realizing it, disregard the state's intention to prohibit opium addiction, secretly smoke it, and mutually follow the old ways, avoiding forced rehabilitation. This is the main reason why complete prohibition has not yet been achieved. Now, the victory has been more than a year and four months, and there is no room for delay in clearing away the filth. It is necessary to quickly and severely prohibit opium addiction, in order to live up to the state's hope of clearing it away as soon as possible.

From April of this year to the present, the Shanghai District Court has accepted more than 1,500 opium addiction cases. Except for those who are indeed not addicted, all have been sentenced to criminal penalties, without any leniency. This can be said to be a serious and powerful demonstration. It is hoped that the voters will take this as a warning and extricate themselves from it as soon as possible.

Furthermore, according to Article 13 of the Measures for Clearing Opium Addiction in Recovered Areas, after the expiration of the rehabilitation period, those who have not been cured of their addiction after inspection and verification will be punished as recidivists according to the law. In addition, Article 8 of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Crimes of Prohibiting Opium and Drugs stipulates that those who inject morphine or use opium drugs, after being ordered to abstain and quit, and then inject or use them again, shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. As for those who manufacture, cultivate, transport, sell, and provide drugs for others to use, they are even more unforgivable by the law, and there are only death penalty and life imprisonment. The dead cannot be brought back to life, and the imprisoned cannot be released. Who is without knowledge, and why would they be so obsessed with opium addiction as to willingly lose their lives and ruin their families? Surely it is not out of self-deception. As for those who make profits from drugs, their hearts are punishable and cannot be forgiven. We must know that the state has made a great determination to prohibit opium addiction, and is seeking to implement it quickly. All those who were already addicted in the past are expected to deeply reflect, abstain from addiction, and repent of their past mistakes. Those who are not addicted at all are expected not to try it lightly, and even more not to make profits from drugs, violating the law and receiving severe punishment.

Now, the Shanghai Municipal Committee for Clearing Opium Addiction has decided to implement a general inspection of drug use from January 1st next year, and promote it with propaganda and guidance. Its intention is to clear away and prohibit it, and wash away the filth. After this, there will be no hope for further leniency. The end of the year is approaching, and time waits for no one. It is hoped that the bright punishments will be revered, and that they will awaken in time, so that they can advance together to prosperity and happiness, and ascend to the spring platform. This would be a great blessing!

### A Perspective on Shanghai's Industrial and Commercial Crisis

— Xu Qijing

The heart of China's economy, along with victory, has triumphantly returned to Shanghai. Shanghai was originally the most prosperous and earliest international commercial center in China. Shanghai is also the largest and most modernized industrial and commercial economic region in China.

Due to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the abolition of unequal treaties, the recovery of concessions, the revocation of consular jurisdiction, and the autonomy of tariffs, this brand new Greater Shanghai should naturally become the nerve center of our China's construction of an industrialized modern country after victory. We did indeed harbor boundless enthusiasm, longing for this beautiful prospect!

More than a year has passed since the victory, and the National Government has long since completed its return to the capital. However, our inspection of Shanghai has shattered our ideals, leaving us with almost nothing but a bizarre dream!

The current industrial and commercial situation in Shanghai can be summed up in one sentence: it is not a scene of revival, but a crisis of great proportions. The crisis lies in high interest rates, high wages, high costs, and high taxes. Under these heavy pressures, amidst various difficulties in capital, raw materials, production and sales, transportation, and the dumping of foreign goods, Shanghai's industrial and commercial sector is now in a situation akin to being "piled with firewood on a fire." Once a financial storm arrives, Shanghai's industry and commerce will likely be unable to avoid an unprecedented panic.

We should not regard Shanghai's industrial and commercial market as merely one aspect of China's economy, but should recognize that Shanghai's industry and commerce are the pivot of the entire Chinese economy. Therefore, if Shanghai's industry and commerce continue to decline, it will inevitably gradually lead to a day when the Chinese economy is on the verge of total collapse!

"Hiding an illness and avoiding treatment" will only worsen the condition; preventing decline is also limited to passive treatment. We try to review the financial and economic measures since the victory and feel a multitude of emotions.

Pressuring Shanghai's industry and commerce are high interest rates, high wages, high costs, and high tax rates; presented to Shanghai's industry and commerce are lack of funds, difficulty in obtaining raw materials, dumping of foreign goods, and a narrow market.

The various difficulties of industry and commerce mentioned above are inevitable facts in a post-war country with declining industries. The main factor is the difficulty of wartime and post-war finances, which affects the problem of post-war currency and financial reorganization. For example, countries such as England, Germany, Japan, and Russia after the First World War all experienced industrial decline. However, the question is whether the government has countermeasures to revitalize industry. Let us look at the United States after this war: economic recovery can be described as rapid, and industrial revitalization is also very fast. Let us also look at the United Kingdom after this war, which was also able to quickly complete economic recovery amidst great trauma and deep pain. The fact that the British trade delegation to China has come to the East with joy this time is even more evident of the rapid progress of British industrial revitalization and the determination to catch up with the development of British trade in the Far East. Let us look even more at the Soviet Union after its victory, which has already completed one year of its Fourth Five-Year Plan. Even Japan, after its defeat, has resumed production of its textile industry and is about to promote sales abroad, which is especially worthy of our vigilance. It can be seen that the fundamental issue lies in the implementation of good economic policies.

We believe that China's current economic crisis, that is, the biggest obstacle to Shanghai's industrial and commercial decline, lies in the near-malignant inflation and the continuous decline in currency value. The most important measure to save the current economic crisis and industrial and commercial decline is to actively stabilize the currency value.

In a modern economic structure, currency is the center. The rise and fall of industry must take currency as its driving force. Especially in the past 20 years, the world economy has entered the era of credit economy, and countries have implemented currency policies one after another since 1931, using inflation and deflation to regulate the industrial economy. Therefore, to save the industrial and commercial economic crisis, we should also pay attention to the use of currency policy. The success of US President Roosevelt's "New Deal" in 1931 and the implementation of the National Industrial Recovery Act was due to the use of inflation policies to save the falling prices at that time.

China has undergone eight years of long-term war, and the consumption of wartime materials is naturally huge, and the financial difficulties during the war are inevitable. Inflation is often a last resort.

However, since the victory, the measures of the regular economic, financial, and monetary policies have only been to deal with various aspects in curing the symptoms of post-war industrial decline and economic crisis, without a thorough plan to quickly solve the entire problem and the courage to act swiftly. As a result, the industrial and commercial crisis and the national livelihood have not only not been fundamentally cured and improved, but have worsened and are becoming increasingly serious. Today, we believe that the fiscal, financial, and economic measures of the authorities must have new initiatives.

The other day, a telegram came saying that in order to solve the current financial and economic difficulties, the government had specially prepared a plan to improve the current financial and economic measures and handed it over to the Executive Yuan for handling. The Executive Yuan is now distributing it to relevant ministries and commissions to discuss specific measures and proceed in an orderly manner. It is also understood that the plan is divided into three major items, the main points of which are: the first item is to assist in production loans; the second item is to use foreign debt; and the third item is to control the prices and wages of daily necessities for people's livelihood. As for its detailed implementation, it is up to the authorities to implement it. We will wait and see and do not want to add more comments here. However, the issue of production loans has already been implemented, and today's industrial and commercial circles deeply feel the difficulties and problems involved. The issue of using foreign capital is not simple and feels like a slow remedy. As for the issue of price and wage controls for daily necessities for people's livelihood, it is just a rehash of old tunes. In China, the bitter nine years of experience is enough to be a painful lesson for future price control policies!

However, in essence, the above three economic measures are still just about the issue of prices and currency.

Now, let's first examine the high interest rates, which are the main factor in the current industrial and commercial crisis in Shanghai:

The emergence of high interest rates is caused by malignant inflation. The exact number of legal tender issued today is kept secret. The financial authorities have not issued a formal inspection report since the second half of the 26th year. This was originally understandable during the war, but it is deeply regrettable after the war.

Although recently, according to the claims of the financial authorities, no legal tender was issued in June and July of this year, and the amount of legal tender issued in recent months has been extremely small. If this is the case, we want to celebrate the revitalization of industry and commerce and be happy for the improvement of people's livelihood. This was originally to effectively stop inflation and gradually improve. Unfortunately, the authorities have not published accurate and clear figures to gain the trust of the people.

However, prices were stable in the months before August 19. But since the Central Bank revised the foreign exchange rate to 3250 for the second time on August 19, prices have risen under its stimulus. Later, due to the surge of US dollars, gold, and Hong Kong dollars, prices became even more volatile. In the past month, due to the price increases of state-owned public utilities such as post, telecommunications, trains, tap water, and electric lights, general prices have been affected and are brewing price increases. If the price index rises again, the salaries of military, government, and education personnel will need to be adjusted urgently, especially the huge military expenditure, and the financial expenditure may continue to be increased due to rising prices. How can we guarantee that the issuance of legal tender will not increase in the future? If the issuance of legal tender increases, will it not stimulate price increases again? Looking back at the price and legal tender race since the 28th year of the Republic of China, the tired pursuit has not stopped to this day, which can be a lesson!

Prices rise and currency values fall. Taking the Shanghai price index in October as an example: food is 564,913.62; housing is 363,733.09; clothing is 1,012,807.86; miscellaneous items are 404,580.06. The total index is 521,855.67. (Source: Statistics published by the municipal government) And the currency value has fallen to one point, falling to 0.002. In short, if prices rise again, there will never be a day of currency stability.

If the currency value is unstable and the purchasing power of legal tender is weakened, the impact will be: (1) the decrease in national income; (2) the unsound national economic psychology; (3) the stagnation of national savings; (4) the increase in the national burden (inflation is an invisible burden of the common people on the country). As a result, on the one hand, idle funds are concentrated, speculation is rampant, disrupting the financial market, and making the rich richer; on the other hand, national income is decreasing due to currency devaluation, the livelihood of the common people is becoming increasingly difficult, and the poor are becoming poorer. All those who hold legal tender, because its currency value is difficult to guarantee, compete to buy gold, US dollars, and Hong Kong dollars, resulting in a strange shortage of funds on the market, and the working capital needed by industry and commerce increases with the increase in wages due to the cost of living index and the rise in raw material prices, and its number often reaches tens of millions. Because of the large amount of legal tender, high interest rates are inevitable.

According to the latest announcement of the Shanghai Money Trade Association, the interest rate in Shanghai is 16.5%, which is higher than in other places. Such high interest rates have become a fatal injury to Shanghai's industry and commerce!

Since the beginning of autumn, Shanghai's industry and commerce have been under the pressure of high interest rates. Stores have closed down and liquidated, and factories have stopped or reduced work, most of which are in a state of semi-paralysis. In the eight, nine, and thirteen months, 80 factories, companies, and commercial firms in Shanghai officially declared liquidation or bankruptcy. Therefore, how to use what kind of policy to suppress the high interest rates in Shanghai today is a crucial issue. Recently, it was heard that the financial authorities, in view of the rampant high interest rates in various places and the great impact on the entire economy, telegraphed the Central Bank to implement a crackdown. The Audit Department of the Central Bank is now adopting a method of having the banking industry in various places negotiate interest rates and then submitting them to the Central Bank for approval. The 16.5% interest rate of the Shanghai Money Trade Association recently seems to be too high. The Audit Department has sent a letter to the industry associations of the banking and money industries, requiring them to gradually lower the interest rate in the future according to market conditions. It is also heard that the Central Bank is using financial power to gradually lower the market interest rate to below 12% as a preliminary standard. The Central Bank has also drafted measures to crack down on underground money houses and submitted them to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation, which may achieve considerable results. However, the financial authorities also deeply feel that "the reasons for the creation of high interest rates are very complicated and cannot be effectively suppressed by rigid means."

How can high interest rates in Shanghai be eliminated today? We believe:

First, expand production loans. Current Shanghai industry and commerce need a lot of working capital because raw materials are expensive, wages are high, and costs are increased. High-interest loans are originally unsustainable and are forced to use them, which is tantamount to a "suicide policy." What is expected from the government is that the loans given to industry and commerce are very small, and the procedures and mortgage conditions are too harsh, making it difficult to apply, and it is felt that it is too slow to solve the urgent needs. Now that the government has prepared a plan to improve the current financial and economic measures in order to solve the current financial and economic difficulties, the total amount of loans for the 36th year is estimated to be 50 billion, and the Yuan has ordered to discuss specific measures. Regarding the transportation and sales of goods, the original Four Joint has "relaxed loan measures" and "mortgage transfer" methods. We believe that: (1) The amount of 50 billion production loans is still insufficient. With the huge need for funds for Shanghai's industry and commerce, small shops borrow tens of millions at every turn, and small factories also need hundreds of millions. How can this mere 50 billion solve the problem? It is hoped that the authorities can effectively coordinate with the production plan and give practical salvation. (2) Relaxing loans is what Shanghai's industry and commerce expect, and the convenience of goods transportation and sales is also what Shanghai's industry and commerce pray for day and night. How to simplify loan procedures and reduce loan mortgage conditions in the future must be based on the principle of facilitating industry and commerce and must not become a mere formality. (3) Expanding syndicated loans should be carried out urgently and should not be limited to salt and tea. All governance should be quick and decisive, and only then can problems be solved. This requires the efforts of the authorities.

Second, implement interest rate policies. The reason why today's high interest rates are caused, we believe, is that the Central Bank has not fulfilled the function of a "bank of banks," and the Four Joint Headquarters has not fulfilled its main duty to eliminate the current industrial and commercial crisis, which is a major factor. How the Central Bank strengthens its functions in the future is definitely something that the regular authorities will actively promote, and the specialization of national banks must be strengthened. The rise and fall of interest rates is originally controlled by the Central Bank's interest rate policy. The Central Bank must also plan its interest rate based on the rise and fall of industry and commerce. The crackdown measures implemented by the Central Bank on today's high interest rates, the so-called bank deposit interest rate, must not exceed the high limit of the loan interest rate, is really a joke. Which bank or money house in the world is willing to absorb deposits at high interest rates and release loans at low interest rates? This kind of interest rate management method is just deceiving children! Of course, the crux of the problem still lies in inflation. If inflation is not rectified, everything is empty talk!

Third, actively reorganize the currency system. In terms of the current economic situation, state-owned public utilities are leading price increases, and everything is eager to rise. If prices rise again, the government's expenses must increase, and tightening the currency is impossible. Under the decline of industry and commerce, if the national treasury wants to increase taxes in order to enrich government revenue, it is like killing the chicken to get the eggs and draining the pond to get the fish. In addition, the Sino-US Commercial Treaty has been concluded, and reciprocal trade has restricted tariff revenue. It is even more difficult to raise debts. Old debts have not been cleared, and the currency value continues to fall. How can new debts be issued? If we rely on the profit income of state-owned industrial and mining enterprises, judging from the past eight or nine years of experience, it is equivalent to climbing a tree to catch fish. What is left is only the two ways of increasing the issuance of currency and selling enemy and puppet properties. If the treasury is not actively reorganized and continues to drag on like this, when will we achieve a balance of payments? We believe that actively reorganizing the currency system is the first step in reforming the treasury. We believe that only by actively reorganizing the currency system, curbing inflation, and stabilizing the currency value can the national treasury have a way to solve the problem.

In short, after the currency is reorganized and the currency value is stabilized, the national income will increase with the revitalization of industry, national savings will also increase sharply with the accumulation of wealth, and social finance can step into a normal path. If the purchasing power of currency is ensured, prices will also tend to stabilize. The difficulties encountered by the industrial and commercial circles today, such as high interest rates, high wages, high costs, and lack of funds, can be solved easily; the economic life of the common people today can also be improved from this.

### A Bird's-Eye View of Overseas Chinese Publications in France

— Special Correspondent Wang Ren of this newspaper, Airmail from Paris, 2nd

Having traveled all over the world, the publication of foreign-language newspapers in major cities is most abundant in New York and Paris. France is a land of freedom, and foreigners in Paris can easily enjoy freedom of speech. According to a recent survey, there are four types of Chinese newspapers in Paris, which are more numerous and wonderful than the overseas Chinese publications printed in Britain, Germany, and the Netherlands.

The first type is the mouthpiece of intellectuals in the overseas Chinese community, called "Overseas Chinese Times," a Monday weekly, currently published to issue 95, straight, 48 cm high, 34 cm wide, lithographed, edited by the painter Fang Wei. The content of this newspaper is divided into sections such as important news from the motherland, international news, overseas Chinese news, reading materials for children, and readers' countries. The leading editorial, such as the recent long-term view of the US Republican Party's victory from various aspects, has unique insights. The important news specially reveals the full text of Chairman Chiang's ceasefire order on November 8, and the propaganda department of the Shen Bao Da Gong Bao on the new Sino-US relationship. Although the length is not much, the content is very rich. The second type is the "San Min Dao Bao" published by the French branch of the Chinese Kuomintang, a Friday weekly, which has been published to issue 69, the whole page is folded into four sections, straight, 32 cm high, 25 cm wide, which is equal to one-fourth of the whole page of Shen Bao, lithographed, edited by Xiao Shijun from Hunan, who studied literature in France. The content of this newspaper is divided into sections such as important news from the country, international news, overseas Chinese news, and literature and art, which is more refined than the Chinese Weekly published in Liverpool, England. Xiao Jun's beautiful calligraphy is hand-copied on stone, and those who get it feel it is especially precious. People who usually help with funding for this newspaper are veteran comrades of the Kuomintang, Zhang Nan, and most of the Qingtian overseas Chinese traders who profited during the war. The newspaper does not reveal any commentary, and it is a typical publication for the overseas Chinese community.

The third type is called "Justice," published secretly on an irregular basis, with no office address, and mailed to readers at any time. It is unknown who wrote it. Straight, 27 cm high, 21 cm wide, mimeographed. When there is something unsatisfactory in France, this newspaper uses hints and sarcasm to express grievances. The parties involved change immediately when they hear about it. This method can prevent extreme privacy and potentially turn big things into small things, and make small things disappear, which is extremely effective in preventing disasters before they happen.

The fourth type is called "Voice of Peace," published by the Overseas Chinese Peace Promotion Association in France, with no partisan relationship, and dedicated to promoting peace. The editor is the scientist Meng Lingya, who usually makes many inventions in pest research and medical chemistry. This newspaper is a bi-monthly booklet, straight, 22 cm high, 18 cm wide, 18 sections (pages) in the whole book. The first half contains commentaries, mostly from Western newspapers such as the US continental edition of "Herald Forum." The aphorisms in its editorial, such as "In ancient times, it was said that a country cannot have two rulers, and today people should say that a country cannot have two armies. If a country has two armies, it will fight to the death. On the contrary, politics can only be resolved politically, and should not use force," are meaningful and can be used as a reference for those who plan the country. The second half contains international news, domestic communications, and satirical essays. In summary, what makes people optimistic about the various publications is that, firstly, there is no fire between the two political publications, so people from all walks of life in the overseas Chinese business and academic circles do not divide their boundaries but help and coordinate with each other. Secondly, the academic community calls Ambassador Qian, the resident in France, a "good old man," and the overseas Chinese community is satisfied with the ambassadors and consuls in Paris when they communicate with relatives and friends abroad. The atmosphere in the newspapers is still peaceful. It is fortunate that these four Chinese publications in Paris are not misused for meaningless disputes. The freedom of speech is considerable, and there is no accidental separation of feelings. The future of China is improving day by day, and the benefits of gathering wisdom and benefiting widely are very great for newspapers.

### The Standardization of Chinese Industry

— A Declaration

Why has Chinese industry lagged behind for decades? This is a question that all Chinese people should ask. I dare to say that the primary reasons are a lack of standardization and a lack of organization. I will write what I know below.

We know that one of the most important causes of waste in industry is the excessive variety of products. The reason for the complexity of products is that buyers often require products tailored to their individual characteristics. For example, many customers like specially formatted stationery, specially designed knives, furniture tailored to their individual needs, and cars that are different from their neighbors. In addition, clothing often has many novel styles. Manufacturers, in order to cope with these ever-changing situations, have initiated a well-organized movement. This movement can not only suppress the increasing trend of product variation as much as possible, but also eliminate the waste caused by this trend in the industrial world. The basis of this movement is Simplification and Standardization.

Simplification and Standardization

——We will not discuss the economic principles of standardization, as well as its advantages and disadvantages, for the time being. Its definition can be explained as an action to transform any product into a certain form, a certain size, and a certain quality. For example, years ago, most engineers unanimously recognized that hexagonal or square shapes were the most suitable forms for the heads of iron bolts and the bases of nuts. Furthermore, they unanimously agreed that all iron bolts above a certain size should have a certain diameter. Later, they were also quite consistent on how many threads should be cut for each size of iron bolt and each volume of bolt head and nut. The only thing that was not specified was the length of the iron bolt, but there were certain regulations for small and short ones. Later, the Society of Automobile Engineers further strictly regulated all the elements of the steel base for manufacturing automobile iron bolts, so the form, size, and quality of all iron bolts were completely specified. However, commercial standardization was still largely limited to large-scale engineering organizations or scientific organizations before the war.

After the United States joined the war, the Conservation Division of The War Industries Board began a very active movement to reduce the variety of all manufactured goods, in order to free up most of the labor, capital, raw materials, and tools for military purposes. The achievements of this department in this work were very impressive. This article will not go into details, but it is worthwhile for readers to study it. This work is now being continued by the Division of Simplified Practice of the Department of Commerce, and its achievements have also made great progress. Generally, their method of carrying out this movement is to first carefully study the problem, and then convene representatives of various manufacturers, sellers, and buyers to discuss it at length, in order to obtain their consent to reduce the number of forms. As a result, they reduced the number of paving tiles from sixty-six forms to fifty-five.

The term "simplification" is used to refer to this movement to reduce the number of product forms. Many modern authors believe that this term should be completely separated from standardization. In fact, this argument is unreasonable. For example, according to the history of iron bolt standardization described above, when all other forms of heads and nuts except hexagonal and square shapes are abandoned, those remaining forms are naturally the standard forms. If all iron bolts other than the several common sizes of iron bolts are abandoned, those remaining iron bolts are naturally also standard iron bolts.

In addition, we cannot say that standardization and simplification are different because true standardization must be based on scientific principles. It is true that redundant forms can often be eliminated without using scientific methods, but it is often unreliable to generalize in this way.

The Organization of Standardization

Modern organizations engaged in standardization work can be conveniently divided into four types: international, national, industrial, and factory standardization organizations. The so-called standards for the work of international organizations are of course basic in nature and have universal uses. Examples include units of electrical resistance, units of electrical power, seconds, minutes, meters, and so on. In addition, the standard gauge used on railways also belongs to the international category.

In the United States, most of the work on developing and approving basic scientific standards relies on the United States Bureau of Standards. For example, the Hoke Standard Gages of Length, which are accurate to one millionth of an inch, are specified by the Bureau. As for the standards used in industry and engineering, they are generally formulated by many engineering organizations and specialized technical organizations. For example, the Boiler Code issued by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers has become the standard for all boiler manufacturing in the country, and even some states have made it into law. In addition, in order to avoid duplication of work and to achieve large-scale cooperation, thirty-three of the most important specialized technical organizations in the country have also formed an American Engineering Standards Committee by sending representatives. The actual work of approving standards is still presided over by the various departments to which they should belong, while the discussions and comparisons are resolved by the entire committee. This is undoubtedly the most powerful organization currently engaged in standardization work, and it may have a great impact on international standardization work in the future.

The Standardization of Form and Size

As far as the current situation is concerned, it is probably not possible to make the movement to simplify the form and size of manufactured goods prevalent in all industries in a very short period of time; and it is also not easy for most manufacturers to solve the problem of selecting the best forms and the most convenient sizes. One of the reasons for this situation is that the standardization of these things often contains some empirical colors, which cannot be solved by mathematical methods. For example, if a manufacturer wants to manufacture steam engines of a certain size and a certain energy, or boots and shoes of a certain length and width, he must deduce a conclusion based on the Law of Average in order to make the form and size of the products meet the greatest need.

However, it is very obvious that the standards determined in this way always have an arbitrary color, and in fact there is plenty of room for selection. For example, there is no particular advantage to why the standard ruler of length is so long. If it had been set longer or shorter at the beginning, its function would still be the same. In addition, the forms and sizes of collars, coats, shoes, and many other manufactured goods are also arbitrarily determined. This standard can only roughly solve some of the problems of meeting needs within a certain range of indefinite needs; in fact, the scope represented by this standard is still covered by larger and smaller standards. Therefore, the procedures for specifying standards for transactions or exchanges are generally of an arbitrary nature. If we want to accurately set one or two forms and sizes of standards for the convenience of manufacturing, it is really necessary to have a very clear understanding of this part of the industry.

Standards of Excellence——We must note that once the form or size of an item has been standardized, there can be several standards of excellence at the same time. Moreover, it is not necessary to find the highest standard of excellence among all types. For example, shoes of a certain model and size can be produced in several different qualities at the same time to meet the needs of people of all levels. To talk about some more valuable products, such as cameras, if only the best kind is manufactured, then the number of people who can enjoy this kind of thing will inevitably be very few. So it is very necessary that if an item of the highest quality is manufactured, it can also be made into a product of the same form and size, although its standard of excellence is slightly lower. However, no matter whether the standard of excellence is high or low, once it is specified, all products must absolutely conform to these standards, which is also very important.

Engineering Standards

The engineering department must determine the standard forms and sizes of most products, and must specify the styles and dimensions of all parts of standard machinery. In addition, if the interchangeability of products is required, the engineering department must also determine the size and form of all parts, so that the purpose of exchange can proceed without hindrance. As for the work of the department itself, it should of course also be standardized. Therefore, all material requisition forms must have standard sizes, all technical guidance documents must have standard forms, standard methods of material lettering and ordering must be implemented, and standard symbols for all drawings and machine parts must be adopted. These standard methods not only make the office work organized, but also can generate the highest efficiency.

Standard Materials——A standard classification method is very important for the needs of incoming goods. However, the benefits and economics of material standardization are known to few people. In many factories, the quality of the materials used is entirely determined by the inventory director or foreman. This method may be sufficient in very small factories or factories that specialize in repair work. But in any case, a job must be able to use the appropriate materials in all parts, and then it can get better products and lower costs. This certainly does not mean that the best materials should be used for any part, but it does mean that if a certain quality of material has been selected for a certain purpose, then one must always be careful that the material used is not wrong.

Reducing the differences in the form and size of various materials can often save huge amounts of money, so after material standardization, the danger of special materials accumulating in piles in the warehouse and depreciating and holding large amounts of capital can be greatly reduced. This benefit is the same for the standardization of supplies. In short, these things must be carefully studied for the purpose of use before they can be purchased.

Standard Quantities

Carefully specifying the quantity of materials used can also generate huge economies. Under repair work, the economy of using materials often becomes a matter of personal prudence, but when the same work has to be repeated continuously, special attention must be paid to the quantity of materials, and the list of materials must have a certain standard, so that it can be used as the basis for incoming goods and as the basis for distributing materials to the warehouse at the same time. Also, whether the list of materials is made by the engineering department or by the production clerk, it should be stored in the archives for future reference.

Standardizing the quantity of supplies is also an economical means. In large factories, those supplies, such as waste materials for washing machines, oil, and brooms, can be distributed using a budget system, and each person receives the quantity necessary for their job once in each period. In addition, it is also easy to standardize the amount of coal required per horsepower, or the amount of coal gas chemicals or other materials used in various industrial processes. If these standard quantities sometimes need to be exceeded, then these additional increases must be explained with adequate reasons.

### New Method for Shrink-Proofing Wool Fabrics

— Translated by Xingxin (From Cotton Manufacture, September Issue)

Wool fabrics that are treated in a neutral hot formaldehyde solution for a long period of time can absorb formaldehyde and reduce shrinkage, but still shrink extremely severely after several washes!

The new method involves placing the wool fabric in a formaldehyde and acid solution, and continuing to heat it to promote complete action; then washing and drying it. Wool fabrics treated by this method do not lose their shrink-proof properties even after prolonged washing, and can also increase strength, wrinkle resistance, dyeability, and alkali resistance. Dyes can also be added to the treatment solution for dyeing at the same time, or the wool fabric can be printed with anti-dyeing substances first, and then treated in a formaldehyde acid and dye solution, which can also produce patterns.

Bacteria have long been used by people, such as for yeast to ferment bread, brew wine, and add flavor to cheese.

The mechanisms in new pianos are made of magnesium and plastic; magnesium replaces wood and is less prone to warping.

The use of waste wood is listed as a special research subject at the University of New Hampshire; the research work focuses on extracting lignin from sawdust to make plastics, and using fermented wood as feed for cattle and livestock.

### Will Brahman Cattle Help China? A New Proposal for Chinese Agriculture?

— Translated by Zhong Deqi

Our country's livestock is mostly draught animals, and the number is extremely small, which is one of the characteristics of our agricultural economy. It has a great impact on farmers' income. This article is a suggestion aimed at this problem, and at the same time proposes an economic rotation system for Chinese agriculture. The author of this article, D. Week, is a famous American agricultural expert. He came to China to lecture in the 20th year of the Republic of China. He is very concerned about Chinese agricultural issues. Translator's note.

China's land use is very intensive and also very extensive. In the central parts of China, there are some grasslands and shrub hills, which sometimes do not necessarily have to be used exclusively for fuel production as they are now. Cotton fields have been expanded in the areas of China suitable for their growth. But cotton is a Soil-deplecing Crop. However, cotton seeds have already become the main source of livestock feed.

In central Brazil, cotton and Zebu or Brahman cattle are very useful in agriculture.

From an agricultural and animal husbandry perspective, Brazil's cattle production problems are similar to those in central China. Diseases and parasites have made those who have tried to extend the beneficial production of Shorthorns, Herefords, and Angus cattle from the Argentine plains all the way to the subtropical zones of south-central Brazil (translator's note: all three of the above are beef breeds. The first two are produced in the United Kingdom, the Shorthorn is named for its short horns, and the Hereford is named after its place of origin. The Angus is originally from Angus Aberdeen-shireAngus in northeastern Scotland, hence the name) suffer economic misfortune. Zebu cattle are resistant to tumors, parasites, and even insects. They originated in India and thrive in hot climates.

Initially, Brazilian livestock farmers tried using "Hereford" and other recognized cattle breeds for crossbreeding, which has been successfully tested in Taxes, USA. But in Brazil, the characteristics of Zebu cattle have a superior trend, and their hybrids with local livestock become very similar to the humped characteristics of Zebu cattle. The current trend is to breed the characteristics of Zebu cattle, propagate good cattle shapes and light colors. Pests attack black cattle, but light-colored cattle are easier to avoid.

Merchants who initially discriminated against the color of Zebu cattle now also feel that they are the savior of the Brazilian beef industry. The latter part has been allowed to pay the same price in the high-quality beef export market, and the first half and the hump are packed in cans or dried.

Far away in central Brazil, the development and prosperity of the land is in progress, and the farm programming plan is cotton Coloniao and cattle. Coloniao is the Brazilian word for Guinea geiass - (Panicum Maximum). (Translator's note: The scientific name of Guinea grass is (PanicumMaximum), which is a kind of perennial herb of the millet genus of the grass family, produced in the tropics and up to 4-10 feet, for fodder). Cattle refers to Zebu cattle and hybrids with local and other species. Guinea grass is grazed four years after cotton is planted. It used to be planted in cotton trunks like an opening crop. These crops complement each other to provide nutritious feed for cattle. These cultivated pastures protect soil erosion and retain fertility after tired cultivated cotton. In frost-free years, the pastures are all as tall as cattle across the acre.

By developing transportation, by replacing fuel with oil or electricity, and by introducing economic fermentation elements to replace the burning of grass and branches in old stoves, wouldn't China benefit from the same crop rotation? In some places, aren't these plans impossible to fully prove successful today? Isn't this question worth putting into their research by livestock agronomy and farm management experts?

Spring and Autumn

### Liberation

— Jie Ding

How can this be considered the first day of the new year? The sky is heavily pressing down, and if it weren't for those few mountain peaks supporting it, it would surely collapse straight onto the ground. Snow fills the pits and valleys, and the white snow and the gray-spotted sky are in contrast. Crows fly around in flocks and scream, as if a catastrophe is coming, or as if they want to break the gray solitude. Most of the bamboo on the mountain has fallen to the ground, or at least formed a ring. Thorns still show their hideous faces, piercing through the white snow. In the valley, everything is confused and seems to be filled with demonic fog. People's hearts are also as heavy as lead. Naturally, on the first day of the new year, such bad weather would make anyone unhappy, and the news that the New Fourth Army is only ten miles away from here makes people even more uneasy. New Year greetings and gambling have all been thrown to the winds. The enemy, coming to this poor place, is at most a stray, and one can hide on the mountain and be done with it. The New Fourth Army is different, liquidation, donations, although there are no rich households in the village, they still have enough to eat. The apportionment is heavy, but it won't be as bad as taking half of the property. Even the homeless young man who does odd jobs for people is uneasy, because he is afraid of being drafted into the army. Doing odd jobs still gets him food, wine, and lodging, but if the New Fourth Army comes, no one will dare to hire odd jobs, what will he do?

Xiao Li works in the county government of the old central government. In fact, if it weren't for the war of resistance, he would definitely be a handsome college student. After graduating from high school, he couldn't swallow being enslaved by the enemy, and would rather risk drilling through the cracks between the enemy and the puppets to work. He treats people very well, and everyone says that Xiao Li is an honest official. — In fact, he is just an accounting assistant in the county government. The township chief also said: "Among the people in the county government, I only admire Mr. Xiao Li."

"Mr. Xiao Li, please step aside, the New Fourth Army will kill you if they see someone from the old central government!" Old Baochang Yang took his dry tobacco pipe and tobacco pouch and said this to Xiao Li. Yes, he should step aside, but many account books and receipts have not been taken away. The general affairs master had already escorted the county magistrate's luggage away, and the loss of the account books would be beneficial to the county magistrate anyway. In addition, the other departments are drafting laborers, and Director Guo of the accounting office is in the provincial government, so the burden falls on him. The Baochang said that all the laborers in the village have been drafted away, what should he do?

So he had to call two children to move the official documents and hide them in a thatched hut in the mountains. Xiao Li was originally wearing plain clothes, but now he stuffed all his documents and pens under the snow. No one would have the guts to take responsibility for putting them in the house, and if they were found, they would be "confiscated".

"Pounce—" The wooden shell gun sounded, very close.

"Da da da..." A light machine gun, "Pat, pat—squeak—" A bullet flew past the side of the house, and the old Baochang told Xiao Li to leave quickly. Xiao Li had no choice but to walk along the mountain path behind the house. After passing three or four houses, he was immediately discovered by two people in gray uniforms crawling and walking quickly.

"Stop—" they shouted, their guns pointing at him, so scary, one fired a shot and ten bullets flew past Xiao Li's side, shouting sharply and urgently.

"Come here, raise your hands, come from the field, hurry up, damn it, hurry up!" Xiao Li obediently walked into the field, the snow water splashed on his thighs, soaking through the tubing, and the mud submerged his ankles.

After a search, there were still 2,000 yuan of legal tender in his bag, and a ring that had just been taken off his finger was hidden in their bag. A soldier pulled on the wool shirt on his body.

"You are not a good thing, the Three Youth League! Where did the old central government go? Tell the truth!"

"I don't know, I'm doing business." Xiao Li had no choice but to say this.

"Damn it, still lying!" "Pat!" A crisp slap.

"Don't say much, take it to the battalion headquarters!" Another

When he saw the battalion commander, several soldiers were "searching" and shooting sporadically. The instructor was trying to stop it, but it didn't work. The instructor was probably wearing too few clothes, and he would shudder every time a gunshot sounded. The soldiers wore long cotton uniforms, thick leggings, hats with ear flaps, no cap badges, sophisticated bullet belts, and long and short rifles, Zhongzheng style, Type 77, Han-made, sleeve, Type 38... almost an exhibition could be held.

"You look like you have knowledge," the battalion commander finally admitted that he was a businessman, because this was proven by the other old people who had been captured, "Why are you still staying with the old central government? They are already stubborn old guys, what's there to miss? Haha, our New Fourth Army is the real revolutionary army, who doesn't say we're good? Wherever we go, the people there are liberated, you are also a young man, you can follow us in the revolution, have food and clothing, what are you afraid of? Don't hesitate, there is no way out of the mountain."

Xiao Li lowered his head. Excessive fear, and the cruelty of the enemy and puppets, the hard work of escaping from the devil's cave, the expectations of his parents, his own future, the admonition of his fiancée... these titles and thoughts surged in his mind like a tide.

"Don't fight, a bullet has to kill an enemy!" The instructor crossed his hands and shouted loudly, and the hand holding the gun was also hidden in his arms. The gunfire still didn't stop, "Pat—" the instructor shivered, "Pat—" another shiver.

He was taken to D Village, and met Zhao, the editor of the ×× newspaper. They exchanged silent glances, and didn't dare to greet each other. There was also an old central government straggler with diarrhea, who was either having diarrhea or groaning with his stomach. The soldiers took the meat, fish, New Year cakes, chicken, and eggs that they had taken, and cooked a large pot, which everyone divided and ate. The prisoners also got some, but the things they were holding were the bowls in the village store that were used to hold chili sauce, which made them cry.

Xiao Li was sick. His body was wet and he caught a cold. He didn't sleep well at night. Three people shared a broken blanket with mildew, which was simply frozen hard. A bonfire was lit in the middle of the house, but the house was like a cool pavilion. Getting closer was like baking bread, and walking away would make you shiver. Of course, you wouldn't get close to the fire when you slept. As a result, his throat was hoarse, his nose was stuffed, and emotions such as fear, anxiety, and disappointment were twisting his heart. His appetite was gone, and his head was heavy and his feet were light and he was about to fall. Sitting or standing would make him see stars in front of his eyes.

The troops had to leave again, and there was a burst of chaos, busy looking for laborers to transport the "trophies", and the soldiers also had to sort out their "foreign wealth". Finally, the team was assembled on a snow-covered exercise field, and the battalion commander put on "new clothes" and looked very energetic.

Xiao Li stood there in a daze, unable to say what he felt. Suddenly, the battalion commander called him and the straggler with diarrhea out. He was even more at a loss and didn't know where he was going.

The battalion commander looked them up and down and said:

"Well, your bodies are in such bad shape, I don't need you. Go back for now, and come back when you're better, but be careful! Without the permission of the New Fourth Army, you must never take a step out of the liberated area, otherwise—hum, the discipline of our liberated area is strict! I'll treat you as reactionaries, businessmen do business, farmers farm, you must never rebel against the Communist Party! Do you understand?"

Xiao Li nodded blankly.

"Okay, go!" The battalion commander waved his hand.

Xiao Li vaguely walked out of their team, and climbed back to H Ridge in a dreamlike state. Looking back at D Village, on the ground dyed into a pure white world by snow, some gray people were moving.

"Liberated," he subconsciously touched his empty bag, and dragged his heavy steps down the ridge. In the valley, only the residual snow on the bamboo falling on the ground made an empty whisper.

### In Commemoration of Beethoven's Birthday

— You Ting

On this day in 1770 (December 16th), a passionate genius was born on the banks of the Rhine River—the musician Beethoven.

Beethoven's biography and historical achievements are known to the world. I do not wish to reprint his life and works. I only wish to express my deep respect with a superficial view.

Beethoven is admirable not only because of the appeal of his works, but also because he devoted all his wisdom and energy, one hundred percent, to the art of music, which was superior to his own life. He remained unmarried throughout his life, and became deaf in middle age due to overwork. Even after losing his hearing, which was a fatal blow to his music, he continued to dedicate his remaining life and talent to diligent creation, and even in his will, he shouted out the unfinished notes. This spirit of fighting against fate and betting everything for art is rare in the history of music. In contrast to other musicians, in Beethoven's brief history, there are very few "romance" stories. Although "Moonlight Sonata" is clearly dedicated to someone as a "Fantasy Sonata," there is no follow-up. He was once engaged to the sister of a certain Count, but the marriage did not happen. After his death, a love letter was found in Beethoven's secret drawer, written in his own hand, with concise but heartfelt words, but without the name of the recipient, and it is unknown to whom it referred. In short, almost all of his energy and effort were spent on the keyboard and musical notes, with very little distraction for romantic love. Yes, this made him eccentric and irritable (for example, he liked to play with water, and if the audience talked during his performance, he would not hesitate to stop playing). However, this abnormal manifestation of his spirit precisely demonstrates that his entire soul was melted into one thing (music). His main works include only nine symphonies, one opera... and thirty-two piano sonatas. He did not seek quantity, but quality. He knew well that "prolific output inevitably leads to fewer masterpieces."

His greatest masterpiece is the Ninth Symphony, also known as the "Choral Symphony" because it exceptionally incorporates a choral part, making it a prominent work among symphonies.

I often feel that Beethoven's religious colors allow his works to be contained within a deep and broad scope. Listen to his Pastoral Symphony (Sixth), which implies: the gurgling of high mountains and flowing water, the warbling of birds in the forest, the shepherd playing the flute, the farmers singing in harmony... all the love and pleasure that nature gives to mankind are truly indescribable.

Although Beethoven lived to be fifty-seven, his works are far fewer than those of most musicians.

Thinking of the musician Beethoven is like hearing his "Pastoral Symphony," the soul rushing from the secular circle to the greatness of nature!

### The Children's Song

— Lin Yongquan

The group of children is coming.

The group of children,

Singing songs joyfully, is coming.

All the pedestrians are encouraged by this singing.

All the workers turn to this singing,

And with the most natural joy,

Look at this group of children.

And the children sing even more unrestrainedly.

Children do not know sorrow,

And all those who listen to this singing forget sorrow.

And those who jump out from the doors,

Run over from the roadside, covered with

Various masks of life,

Also forgetfully greet and sing along.

This world,

Is a children's world!

A world of love, a world of innocence!

This singing,

Causes withered flowers and plants to sprout new buds,

Causes withered branches to grow tender leaves,

Causes hibernating pupae to wriggle,

Causes cattle and sheep in the wild to prick up their ears,

Causes the faces of old people to radiate the smiles of youth,

Causes the hearts of young people to harmonize with songs of happiness,

Causes wandering breezes to become more naughty and lively,

Causes the sunshine to become more affectionate and warm,

Causes dead love to revive,

And makes the earth return to spring.

This is life!

This is the continuation of mankind,

The continuous generation of living things!

But the child driving the horse cannot sing!

He seems sick,

As if completely numbed by the painful life;

The colt pulling the cart cannot sing either,

It seems overly hungry and overly tired.

But the child driving the horse,

Still has to shout at it and whip it—

This is the whip of life!

Can he still listen to this singing?

Can it still savor this singing?

Although he is mixed in the singing,

He is carrying the singing, dragging the singing.

This world still has many imperfections!

This joyful singing still hides sobbing!

This mankind still needs greater fairness and harmony!

(December 2, 35th year, in Kunming)

### Returning Cart in the Wilderness (Photography)

— Liu Xucang

### Who Exactly Deceived You?

— Zhao Yuan

It's almost midnight. There is boundless silence in the courtyard. Occasionally, one or two vendors run in and shout in hoarse voices: "Fried rice candy, boiled water, salted tea eggs..." These intermittent cries, like the groans of a patient, are truly annoying. They replace the noisy clamor of the children in the courtyard during the day, embellish the silence of the night, and break through this quiet surrounding. The cold moon slants to the west, and the night deepens, bringing me an inexplicable melancholy. The Catholic Church in the distance sends a burst of clear, serene, and mournful chimes.

A memory unconsciously floats to my mind.

It was almost four years ago. On the banks of the Jialing River, due to common interests, we got to know each other at a literary discussion meeting. In the short span of two months, we went from strangers to bosom friends. A friendship formed by chance gradually turned into regret for not meeting sooner. Different ages, two hometowns tens of thousands of miles apart, we forged a bond of intimate friendship. We played together, read books together, and talked together. His wisdom, insights, and knowledge gave me great inspiration, and I have respected him ever since. Whenever the sun set in the west and dusk approached, he stood on a small hill, expressing endless emotion to the clouds floating northeast in the sky, and often reminisced about his lost hometown—the White Mountains and Black Waters. Discord in his family created his solitary and quiet nature. He often resonated with anger and hatred towards the rampancy of the enemy and the daily decline of national affairs. It was his love for his motherland and his hometown that later enabled him to embark on the expedition, fighting far away in India and Burma and burying his body in a foreign land.

One winter night, with heavy rain and piercing snow, he and several of his fellow students who were enlisting went to the training regiment headquarters. He came to say goodbye to me. At that time, his flushed face could not help but bring tears to my eyes, and I could not say a word. At the moment of parting, I could only hold his chapped hand tightly. He was only wearing a few thin clothes that were not enough to keep him warm, and his feet were red with cold from wearing straw sandals. I was really worried that he would catch a cold at that time. But he replied, "What does it matter for the country?"

Later, he sent me a letter from India. Life in the army was not as ideal as he had imagined. The darkness, tyranny, and unreasonable "hillbilly" habits suffocated the spirit of many intellectuals. Bureaucratic style destroyed the iron will of the young people. Many sensitive comrades committed suicide out of worry and indignation. But for the sake of the country's survival and the nation's safety, he never complained once. He worked hard and diligently, saying, "Kill one more enemy, spend one less bullet." This was his spiritual comfort. The torrent of the Irrawaddy River washed him so strongly, and the peaks of the Savage Mountains enabled him to overcome the harsh environment. He often wrote in his letters, "Life as a soldier is the real battle of life."

He had been wounded twice, and finally died unfortunately in the mop-up campaign in northern Burma. When the news of his death reached me, I looked westward and watched the fall of this giant star in the sky. The torrent of the Irrawaddy River finally led him to the final destination of truth. The title of "died for the country" is forever hung in the souls of the soldiers.

We can be said to have gained victory, or it can be said to be lucky. Did I deceive him? Writing this, I can't help but think of Lu You's poem, "I knew from the beginning that all things are empty when dead, but I grieve that I cannot see the unification of Kyushu." I think he may have felt the same way!

Friend, your hopes have also received the final answer. Won't you be able to rest in peace in the afterlife? But, friend, it has been more than a year since the victory, and the land is still full of the flames of war. The compatriots in the Northeast are reliving their dreams. Can they still rest in peace forever? The White Mountains and Black Waters are once again covered with dark clouds and turbulent currents. He is sleeping in a foreign land, and I am afraid he is also thinking of his distant homeland! Where is the victory that has been won? To whom does the victory belong? The gold, foreign houses, cars, and women of the receiving firemen, the mounds of bones, and the blood and tears of the common people. His beautiful dream was crushed by those criminals of the Republic of China, cleanly and thoroughly. Those are the people who have betrayed his hope!

Hey, friend, who exactly deceived you? The victory that has been won and lost can only wait for future history to answer you!

### Poetic Words

— Tian Su

A poet must possess a pair of sharpest eyes, a most sensitive nose, and a pair of most sensitive ears, and also requires the most flexible pen of Yu Zhi.

Using accumulated experience as the warp, and rich imagination as the weft, the poet weaves all his touching poems.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 123

— Ye Jingfeng

Crane—"Why is Konoe paying attention to a small character like me?"

Ping—"He didn't pay attention at first. It was the members of the General Staff and the Fifth Column who brought you up here."

Crane—"Do you think he's paying close attention to me now?"

Ping—"He said you are a promising young talent."

Crane—"How do you know?"

Ping—"Teacher Aoki told me this morning."

Crane—"How does Elder Aoki know?"

Ping—"He first used telepathy to investigate for you; then he confirmed it by telephone."

Crane—""Telepathy"... how is it used?"

Ping—"Telepathy is like a thinking communication technique. The person practicing the technique concentrates their thoughts and can explore the thoughts of others. Didn't I mention "Occultism" in the German's car yesterday? This use of telepathy is a kind of application skill in occultism."

Crane—"Then, you should also be able to use it."

Ping—"It's still very early. I'm just starting out, just doing preliminary work."

Crane—"Try it. Do you know what's on my mind?" (Crane is worried that Pingzi can really use telepathy.)

Ping—"I can try, but the power is too small, and there are many necessary conditions for performing the technique. First, extend your hand and let me hold it..."

The two stopped at the same time. Pingzi held Crane's left hand in her own two hands. They stood like this for a long time. Then Pingzi released her right hand, only holding Crane with her left hand. At this time, the moonlight was thicker, projecting the figures of the two onto the beach, forming a long pair of black shadows, standing opposite each other. Pingzi's pair of bright eyes stared at Crane. Crane looked serious and dignified, also looking at Pingzi. Pingzi, however, had a cheeky smile on her face. After a while, Pingzi spoke, saying Crane's thoughts:

"You are very beautiful, and you are also somewhat clever, but unfortunately, I don't love you... (Now the thoughts are changing), Are you playing tricks? Or do you really have magic powers? (It's changing again)... I will also concentrate my thoughts to resist, not let you know what I am thinking... (It's changing again) Concentrate a little... China... no... I can't think about these... Tokyo, not good either, the bright moon in the sky is very good... I want to go to the Moon Palace to rest for a while... What is the Moon Palace like? Are there mountains and water?... "

Pingzi said up to this point, leisurely let go of Crane's hand, turned around, covered her face with her hands, and began to sob softly. Although Crane was strong-willed, he was, after all, made of flesh and blood and could not be without emotion. At this moment, watching Pingzi suddenly sob while trying to perform telepathy, he knew that Pingzi must have been focusing her energy, but her skills were not deep enough, and she used too much force. Also, because he deliberately changed his thoughts and deliberately resisted strongly, her mental power suddenly showed a chaotic phenomenon, thus arousing emotions. He couldn't help but suddenly feel sad, feeling that this woman was so infatuated with him, it was quite pitiful. However, he was unable to comfort her. He was so embarrassed that he was at a loss, standing there blankly.

### Ramblings Under a Dim Lamp

— Shao Fu

Chinese Girl

During the war, Hollywood produced many war films. Among those related to China, as far as I know, there are "Back to Bataan," "China Clipper," "The Chinese Children," "China Girl," etc.

As a Chinese person, seeing these films, to be honest, I don't feel interested. The themes, stories, etc., are wide of the mark, distort the facts, and are completely unreal. They are too detached from our lives.

Therefore, even with Pearl S. Buck's "The Good Earth" and Paul Muni's acting skills, it failed to be welcomed by us, and that is why.

Crash

Gold and silver stocks have all fallen again.

Everyone could see this coming, but those who are obsessed will not have this realization.

Why? A friend told me that the rise is unlimited because people's desires are endless. The more it rises, the more people expect it to rise. Gold is best at one million, and US dollars at ten thousand... and the fall is limited. Falling to a certain degree, it will hurt, and people will not be willing to let it fall further.

Traffic Order

Recently, the traffic order in the city has deteriorated again. At five or six o'clock in the afternoon, it often takes more than twenty minutes for a car to go from the Bund to Chengdu Road, crossing Nanjing Road. I would like to raise the following specific questions to the responsible authorities:

(1) Is one-way traffic on Sichuan Road very suitable?

(2) Is there a standard for opening and closing the red silk lights?

(3) When incidents occur, should consideration be given to not hindering traffic?

(4) Should those who violate traffic regulations be strictly punished?

### Everyone Is Trying to Eat

— Fang Wen

In half a month, Shanghai citizens have been startled twice. Once, it was because the ban on street vendors caused riots. Street vendors were originally a small problem. Why did it turn from small to large, causing an uproar? Because the street vendors want to eat!

The street vendor problem has just been resolved, and the Jiangwan Arsenal exploded with a bang again. The cause has not yet been officially announced, but according to the soldiers near the scene of the accident, "When grenades were being moved into the warehouse, it was lunchtime. At that time, a warehouse soldier shouted, 'It's time to eat!' The porter was absent-minded and arbitrarily unloaded the entire box of grenades he was carrying, which collided with the ground and caused a disaster." If the rumor is true, the cause of this disaster was also to eat! The difference is that the street vendors were forced to stand up because their existing rice bowls were broken, while the porters had rice bowls and, thinking about the difficulty of eating today, their hearts blossomed when they heard the call to eat, and they were careless in their work. This caused a disaster.

The roots of both disasters were to eat. "Nothing in the world is as difficult as eating," is indeed true.

Now that industry and commerce are declining and all industries are sluggish, there are at least two million unemployed citizens in Shanghai. In order to prevent the recurrence of the third and fourth unfortunate events, I hope that those who care about the people's livelihood should make preparations before it rains!

### Loss of Faith

— Jia Xuezhen

The day before yesterday, I borrowed 20,000 yuan from a friend, agreeing to return it to him yesterday morning. Yesterday, in order to repay this debt, I also ran around outside, but to no avail, so I am still anxiously waiting today.

This afternoon, a policeman in green came and handed me a letter. When I saw it, it was sent by this friend. I naturally understood what this letter should say, and then a chill followed the excitement.

I trembled and tore open the envelope.

"Strange, why is it just an empty envelope? Where did the letter go?" When I opened it and found that there was no letter paper, I couldn't help but exclaim.

"Who lost faith? Who lost faith?"... My wife ran out of the kitchen, asking in a panic.

"I... I am the one who lost faith... ah..." I suddenly realized.

### NAMRETAW

— Lu Shixiong

During the Anti-Japanese War, the traitors who had submitted to the enemy puppets were also called "fallen people." Someone translated it as "Waterman."

But someone asked this translator, if the fallen person is very powerful and transforms himself, and still holds a position after the victory, how should such a person be translated? He said: This is undoubtedly "Waterproof."

A male student was infatuated with a certain woman. He presumptuously sent her a love letter, but it was difficult to address her. He used "Beautiful Brand" instead of the lady's name on the letter. She was puzzled when she received it. Later, she found out that Beautiful Brand was "my dear," so she was very angry. As a result, she also returned a letter to him, using "Good Year" instead of the male student's name on the letter. He opened it and didn't understand what "Good Year" meant. Later, after inquiring in various ways, he learned that "Good Year" was the famous Goodyear rubber car tire. It can be said to be a tooth for a tooth, tit for tat.

A foreign sociologist studied the problem of prostitutes in China. Among them, there is the so-called "half-open door," which the translator translated as half open door. The foreigner thought about this for a long time and sighed: In foreign countries, there is only the Monroe Doctrine and the Open Door Policy, (open door policy) and I have not heard of a "half-open door." The translator is also a complete bookworm. He said that perhaps this is a compromise.

I remember when I was in school, a classmate used Kiss and Miss very cleverly in verbs and nouns. I will record it for a laugh:

"It is better to kiss a miss than to miss a kiss"

### Regarding "Misleading the Children"

— Shengjie

I occasionally wrote a story about "misleading the children," which unexpectedly aroused Mr. Fang Cheng's "resonance." However, he seemed to express quite a bit of sympathy for the teacher who "misled the children."

I originally didn't dare to make too much of a fuss, but I boldly say that countless teachers who have "misled the children" cannot but thank this defense.

I am very ashamed. I not only did not cross the gate of the university, but also did not graduate from middle school. The war has affected my personal education, and I have been running around for eight years. Therefore, I decided to return to school again. Fortunately, I managed to get into a vocational school with equivalent academic ability. Unexpectedly, the reality is too disappointing! My naked article was written after experiencing it firsthand.

I sympathize with the "crime of the scholar," which is sometimes wronged. I sympathize with the teaching profession, which is very hard. I also quite understand the importance of respecting teachers, and I don't think I should criticize teachers too much. However, what is school for? Is it possible to allow the habit of "fooling around" in the officialdom to intrude?

If it is said that the party and the league should withdraw from the school, then the teachers who are "fooling around" must first withdraw from the school.

If they do not prepare before class, "the gimmicks are too good" during class, there are classes outside of class, and there are topics outside of the topic. They brag and talk nonsense. When half the time has passed, they say, "I'm sorry for leaving early." This kind of teacher's "misleading of the children," I think, is definitely not Guan Yu's "wronging him!"

Yes, the students' level after the Anti-Japanese War is generally low, but precisely because of this, we hope that the teachers can put in more effort! I also hope that the school will be more serious. Mr. Fang Cheng has been teaching for many years and feels that "misleading the children" seems to be a "trumped-up charge." In the lines, he cleverly makes implicit defenses for his colleagues. Those teachers who are fooling around will thank you, but the thousands of students who are eagerly seeking knowledge will be exactly the opposite.

### Taking Advantage of Other People's Joy

— Fang Wen

A few days ago, a Shen Bao reader revealed a new scam: "Recently, some people have been running around in major hotels and wedding families. When the ceremony is about to be held, they seal a 100,000 or 200,000 enemy puppet period check, send a big gift, and swindle 10,000 or 20,000 yuan in joint force. Running ten or eight houses a day, the income is quite considerable."

This kind of scam is not taking advantage of people's danger, but taking advantage of people's joy.

In fact, the scam of taking advantage of people's joy has been popular at sea for a long time. In addition to the above, there are also those who pretend to be students and old friends, eat wedding banquets for free, mix with the guests, enter and leave the bridal chamber, and steal women's clothing and ornaments. It is also heard from time to time; however, people who do happy events are all joyful, harmonious, and generally unwilling to put on a face and argue with people; moreover, one can only have a few happy events in one's life, so even if they suffer a small loss once, they will let it go. Especially now that happy events are held, they are mostly combined by the men's and women's families, and the guests of the two houses do not know each other.

This kind of con man who takes advantage of other people's joy is using this advantageous occasion to perform!

The methods of prevention are:

(1) Gift money is handed over to the bank for collection and donated to charity.

(2) After the bank collects the money, it issues admission tickets on behalf of the guests. Guests enter the venue with tickets.

Shanghai Cross-Section

### Little Brother Missing

— Jianhua

The newspaper reported that the two children, Jiang Lingdi and Jiang Maomao, of Xietai Bank, disappeared at the same time. The next day, they were suddenly found in Gujia Park, and the security guard reported to the police and sent them back. According to the two children, two people took them into a car and drove away quickly. After delaying them for one night, they were sent to this park the next morning. The matter is quite suspicious, whether it is a prank by an enemy, or there is another purpose, it has not yet been clarified. It is indeed unbelievable. According to what my friend knows, similar incidents have occurred recently, not just the two Jiang children. Because the children have no damage, each parent knows less is better than more, so they do not pursue it. Even the police station does not pursue it because this kind of behavior is neither kidnapping for ransom nor inducing and剥夺 children.

However, are they full, have nothing to do, and are joking with children? Of course not. According to my friend's speculation, their target is the children's urine. It seems like a smile is not worth it, but in the era when Chinese medicine is still being promoted, pure boy urine is a treasure that money cannot买到. Therefore, they do not hesitate to use cars to pick up and send the children who produce道种.

Now there is a kind of national medicine, called "× Stone", which is expensive and exceeds ginseng. It sells well in various ports in Southeast Asia. The raw material of Daoyao is made by煎炼using boy urine. The urine excreted by fat white children under the age of twelve from good families is the most suitable. All postpartum disorders, yin deficiency and prolonged coughs, and pulmonary tuberculosis with hemoptysis have miraculous effects after taking it. In the past, in 1927, there was also this kind of trick in Hangzhou. Later, the case was solved by the police station, but it was done by an old Min from a medicinal materials store. It can be seen that there is nothing strange in the world.

Common Sense Test

### The Problem of a Piece of Ice

— Ding Yichang

Although Jiangnan is warmer than the northern regions, every year in the deep winter, it inevitably experiences frost and ice a few times. Last time, we talked about the scientific common sense of various heating methods. This time, let's take ice as the theme and write ten questions for everyone to try.

If scientific common sense can be mixed with everyday phenomena around us, not only is the interest stronger, but it is also easier to remember. People around middle school age should be able to answer more than six questions. A side note: the temperatures mentioned below refer to the "centigrade scale," that is, the Celsius scale. The answers will be published in this column tomorrow.

(1) We all already know that the "freezing point" of water is zero degrees. But I want to ask the opposite question: when the temperature of extremely pure water gradually decreases and falls below zero degrees, do you think:

A, it must freeze completely at zero degrees without exception?

B, it starts to freeze when it is slightly above zero degrees?

C, extremely pure water can be cooled to four degrees below zero before freezing?

(2) In an electric refrigerator, we put the following three bowls of liquid, and then gradually lower the temperature inside the refrigerator. Which of the three bowls do you think will freeze first, which will freeze second, and which will freeze last? Please fill in the order in the parentheses.

A, Extremely pure water ( )

B, Bone broth or pig trotter soup ( )

C, Salt water ( )

(3) There is a glass, its capacity is exactly enough to hold roughly 1000 c.c. of ice. At this time, the surface of the ice block is exactly "level with the mouth of the glass," no more, no less. If the ice in this glass melts, and is then filled with hot boiling water at 100 degrees, and it also reaches "level with the mouth of the glass," how much would be needed:

A, Only 1000 c.c. of hot boiling water?

B, Less than 1000 c.c. of hot boiling water to fill it?

C, Or, more than 1000 c.c. of hot boiling water is needed to fill it?

(4) Put a piece of ice of known volume into a measuring cup with markings, and cover the mouth of the cup with a glass slide to prevent water vapor from escaping. At that time, the temperature of the ice was exactly zero degrees. Afterwards, it slowly changes to water due to room temperature, and then becomes hot water due to heating. Precisely speaking, how does the volume (c.c.) change from ice to hot water? Is it:

A, Always the same from beginning to end, neither increasing nor decreasing?

B, Decreasing slightly at first and then slowly increasing?

C, Or, always increasing from beginning to end?

(5) One kilogram of ice (zero degrees), poured into fifty kilograms of boiling water (one hundred degrees). The ice melts when it encounters heat. Do you think:

A, This kilogram of ice immediately and completely melts into water?

B, The water after the ice has completely melted is also very warm?

C, Or, if not relying on room temperature as a supplement, numerically speaking, this boiling water still cannot completely melt the ice?

(6) Without the help of room temperature, roughly calculate, how many cups (cups of the same capacity) of extremely hot boiling water (one hundred degrees) do you think it would take to melt a cup of ice into water? (Note: The steam from the boiling water is not included.)

A, Eighty cups?

B, One hundred and twenty cups?

C, Ten cups?

(7) It is commonly said that the freezing point of water is zero degrees. But please answer the following:

A, Is the temperature of all ice zero degrees without exception?

B, Can the temperature of ice be below zero degrees?

C, Or, is the lowest temperature of ice always zero degrees?

(8) After the surface of the ocean and large lakes freeze, there is still liquid seawater and lake water underneath. Then, do you think the water temperature of these two is:

A, Higher for fresh water than for salt water?

B, Higher for salt water than for fresh water?

C, Or, the same for both?

(9) To raise the temperature of ice by one degree and to raise the temperature of the same weight of water by one degree, which do you think is easier, i.e., requires less "heat"?

A, Is it easier to raise the temperature of ice?

B, Is it easier to raise the temperature of water?

C, Or, is it the same for both?

(10) To heat one kilogram of ice at zero degrees and turn it into cold water at zero degrees, how much heat is required? Do you think it is equivalent to how many kilograms of cold water heated from zero degrees to warm water equal to human body temperature (thirty-seven degrees)? Roughly speaking:

A, Equivalent to the heat required to heat one kilogram of cold water as described above to form warm water?

B, Equivalent to the heating of twenty kilograms of cold water as described above?

C, Or, equivalent to the heating of eighty kilograms of cold water as described above?

The answers will be revealed tomorrow.
