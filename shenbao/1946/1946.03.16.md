### Resolution on Military Demobilization Work; Urging Attention to National Defense Construction; Improving the Treatment of Officers and Soldiers and Implementing Meritorious Awards

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] The resolution on military demobilization work passed at the 17th meeting of the Second Plenary Session on the morning of the 15th is as follows:

Resolution on Military Demobilization Work

The meeting listened to the report on military demobilization work and the proposals of the members, and after detailed deliberation, it was considered that the military and political authorities were able to determine the plan and earnestly implement it in accordance with the instructions of the Supreme Commander in all aspects of the military demobilization. In particular, the reorganization of the army has been carried out effectively, and all of our officers and soldiers have been able to deeply understand the meaning of justice, obey orders, and comply with the implementation. The proposals of the members are mostly pertinent and meet the needs, which is gratifying. This eight-year war of resistance against Japan enabled the enemy to surrender unconditionally and achieved the final victory, thanks to the loyalty, bravery, and struggle of all our officers and soldiers who fulfilled their duties. However, at a time when lasting world peace has not yet been firmly established, the survival of our nation and the guarantee of national independence still depend on a substantial national defense force, and the guarantee of international peace also depends on the strength of peace-loving countries to safeguard peace. Therefore, in the future, special attention should be paid to national defense construction and preferential treatment of national soldiers. In view of the current situation and looking forward to the future, the following points should be noted:

(1) Active Construction of Modern National Defense Modern national defense must integrate the army, navy, and air force to unify its construction and command in order to ensure consistent steps and exert overall effectiveness. The military foundation should be based on industry and science, especially focusing on air force construction. As for the conscription system and its organization, it must be vigorously improved to achieve soundness so that a minimum number of standing armies can be retained in peacetime, and sufficient troops can be rapidly mobilized when necessary to meet actual needs. The training and reserve of reserve officers must also be established and properly implemented.

(2) Substantial Improvement of the Treatment of Officers and Soldiers The hardship of the lives of officers and soldiers has reached its extreme. If it is not substantially improved, it will not only reduce morale and affect discipline, but also make it impossible to improve the quality of the army, which will hinder the future of army building. The relevant government departments should improve it as soon as possible in accordance with the following principles: (a) The treatment of officers and soldiers should be compared to that of civil servants in order to achieve fairness. (b) Staple and non-staple foods and horse feed should be provided publicly, and the established plan of in-kind subsidies should be implemented. If a part must be paid in cash, it should also be paid in full according to market prices. (c) Military uniforms should be made publicly for officers and distributed at a fixed price, and soldiers should be given full public provision. (d) Irregular forces (guerrilla forces, advancing armies, etc.) should be quickly reorganized. If they cannot be reorganized immediately due to special circumstances, they should be temporarily paid living expenses to maintain their lives. (e) The army should gradually equip fixed barracks and pay attention to conservation, thereby isolating them from residents in order to facilitate management and education.

(3) Proper Settlement of Demobilized Officers and Soldiers Demobilized officers and soldiers should be given preferential treatment and properly settled. The government should formulate a plan for (receiving, educating, nurturing, and using) in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's policy on military industry, land reclamation, and career change, so that they can engage in national production and construction during peacetime, each in their own place, and each living in peace, and that they can be mobilized and recalled during wartime to remain loyal and brave soldiers defending the territory, so that demobilization work can proceed smoothly, and local order can be stabilized.

(4) Earnestly Handle Meritorious Awards, Pensions, Commendations, and Relief Matters Officers and soldiers who have fought loyally and bravely during the war of resistance against Japan should be given meritorious awards. Wounded and disabled soldiers should be properly settled, and their families should be given relief. The officers and soldiers who died in battle and their orphans should be carefully investigated and commended and given pensions separately, so that meritorious deeds must be rewarded, awards must be given for meritorious deeds, the dead can rest in peace, and the living can be supported, so as to conform to the state's purpose of rewarding merit and encouraging loyalty. The procedures should also be simplified as much as possible in order to obtain practical benefits.

### Requesting the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to Increase the Amount of Food Allocated

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 15th] Today, the Second Plenary Session announced a resolution requesting the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to increase the amount of food allocated to China in order to relieve famine in various parts of the country. In addition, it also requested the administration to assist China in purchasing rice from various regions in Southeast Asia and wheat from the United States and Canada.

[United Press, Chongqing, 14th] The Second Plenary Session today proposed that the government reduce the rations for Japanese prisoners of war and prohibit the use of rice, wheat, sorghum, and other grains for brewing alcohol in order to alleviate the shortage of food for the people.

### United States to Transfer Eight Warships; Sailing to China on April 1st

### Character Sketches of the Second Plenary Session

— Our Newspaper Chongqing Special Correspondent Zhao Haosheng

President Chiang attended the opening ceremony and the two memorial weeks, wearing military uniform. Each time, he entered from the right side door of the venue and stood on the rostrum. Under the illumination of the mercury lamps, his demeanor was particularly radiant, his face was full of benevolence, as if he was sitting in a family reunion. When delivering his speech, his tone was firm and forceful, every word was like cutting iron, with cadence and inflection, full of infinite power and moving emotion. When reading the will of the Founding Father and the party member code of conduct, he spoke slowly and clearly, which was thought-provoking, and his emotions were full in his words. Each time the ceremony was completed and the music was played, the President stood solemnly in front of the seat, and finally returned the salute to everyone, and walked out from the right side door of the rostrum.

The eleven members of the presidium of the congress have different styles. Yu Youren has a burly physique, is energetic, and has a flowing silver beard. He sits upright in the leather-backed chair in the center of the rostrum. Surrounded by the colorful decoration, he becomes an incomparably magnificent picture. Yu speaks in a low Shaanxi accent, which sounds particularly solemn through the loudspeaker. On the afternoon of the 7th, Yu presided over the most heated "Political Consultative Conference Review Meeting," and his command was well-defined and always orderly.

President Ju often wears a light blue cloth gown, which has been washed for a long time and seems to be a little white. Occasionally, he adds a black waistcoat or mandarin jacket, and a pair of white-soled round-toed cloth shoes, which are spotless. He is full of lightness and expresses an infinitely elegant demeanor. He presides over the congress slowly, calmly, and with clear pronunciation.

President Dai's clothing is more elegant and luxurious than President Ju's. He often wears a gray rat skin robe with a large dark blue flower pattern, covered with a satin mandarin jacket. The badge of the Central Committee member is worn on the right lapel. The mottled short mustache expresses hidden determination and strength. When speaking, the layers are clear, and he speaks in a purely slow Sichuan accent, with clear words. He often goes to the rostrum himself to hand in the slips requesting to speak. On the morning of the 11th, he had a long conversation in a low voice with Feng Yuxiang, who was sitting in the back row, during the border issue report.

Mr. Chen Guofu is an old fighter of the party, and he is also a person who can overcome illness with superhuman vitality. During the meeting, he rarely missed or arrived late. He wears a long robe and mandarin jacket, but with a black woolen collar. The loudspeaker on the rostrum is very loud, but during the entire three hours of the meeting, the following never heard Mr. Guo cough.

Those who have attended the Political Consultative Conference will know President Sun's ability to preside over the meeting. He has always been calm and unhurried. He has a habit of always pushing the nearsighted glasses on the bridge of his nose to his forehead when reading documents.

Minister Chen Cheng's energetic and powerful spirit can be seen in his piercing eyes. He sits in the chairman's seat and presides over the congress, always with a smile on his face. However, Minister Chen was unlucky. The seventh meeting he presided over was the post-war relief report and review, which was right after the foreign affairs review. The storm had just passed, and the atmosphere in the venue was relaxed but a little tired. Reviewing post-war relief was like talking about family affairs, and he also encountered a lengthy speech by member Liu Chengcan, whose talks often made people laugh, so that he could not help but urge again and again: "Keep it brief."

Commander-in-Chief He's majesty also constitutes an incomparably brilliant picture on the rostrum. His face is ruddy and full, and a row of colorful medals on the left chest reflects each other with the gold collar badges of the general, shining brightly. He speaks in a purely Guizhou dialect, which is as slow and clear as Sichuan dialect.

Mr. Zou Lu's clothing and actions are very casual, and his voice is relatively sharp and fast. His report of: "Comrade XXX of No. XX is speaking" often makes it difficult for people to hear clearly, so that it is impossible to index according to the map. However, when the speaker asks him to "extend it for one more minute," he always often generously agrees.

Mr. Chen Lifu has not yet presided over the congress, but he is often the external representative of the presidium. The petition representatives of various provinces in North China are received by him and Vice President Bai on behalf of the presidium, and the petition delegation of Anhui students in Chongqing is also received by him and Mr. Zhang Daofan on behalf of the presidium. He has not yet spoken at the congress.

General Bai Chongxi is one of the members of the presidium who speaks more at the congress. His talks are powerful and decisive, and often win great applause.

Mr. Zhang Daofan is the most hardworking member of the presidium. He has become the spokesperson of the presidium, and many documents are reported by him to the congress. He speaks in a purely Mandarin Chinese, often adding "Next, please pay special attention" before each paragraph! "Here is an even more important motion!" During the break, he is often seen holding a long cigarette holder with a burning cigarette in his mouth, chatting with people around him, his words are relaxed and his laughter is loud. When the meeting is in session, he is often seen wearing yellow chemical glasses frames, quietly reading the report.

### Developing Transportation in the Northwest; Supporting Private Shipping

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] The 17th meeting of the Second Plenary Session passed a resolution on transportation issues, the main points of which are as follows: It is noted that transportation issues, including transportation and communication, were extremely important during the War of Resistance against Japan because they were related to the gains and losses of military affairs. Now that the enemy has surrendered, the completion of demobilization work also relies on transportation as the main item. How to lay the foundation for national construction and strengthen national defense is also the top priority of transportation. In the future, the established policies should be followed, the strength should be strengthened, and efforts should be made to achieve the goal. Now, a comprehensive review of the various points is presented as follows: (1) Transportation employees have worked hard and are worthy of commendation. (2) The allocation of manpower, materials, and financial resources by the Ministry of Transportation is limited by the facts, and it is difficult to achieve the appropriate progress. In addition, the CCP troops obstruct and destroy everywhere, but the transportation employees can still persevere. It is hoped that when the situation permits, work will be carried out quickly in order to meet the needs. (3) The railway and highway construction projects that were rushed during the war and repaired after the war are beneficial to demobilization transportation, but they are still insufficient for actual needs. (4) The reform of the transportation system is still hoped to continue to be studied. (5) The water, land, and air demobilization transportation plan is limited by tools and has failed to meet the needs. The government should hand over the various transportation tools that have been received to the Ministry of Transportation for management and utilization as much as possible, and instruct it to plan and manage them in a unified manner. The management organization must strive to be centralized and simplified, and at the same time, pay attention to eliminating all malpractices and severely cracking down on black market tickets. The transportation of righteous people and refugees returning to their hometowns should not be delayed. (6) Northwest transportation is related to the national plan. Whether it is railway, highway, aviation, or postal and telecommunications, it should be actively developed and listed as the most important work, and planned for implementation. Now, at the time of army reorganization, there will be many surplus officers and soldiers, who should be properly settled. The method of using military engineering for road construction is very appropriate and can be discussed in detail with the relevant agencies and actively promoted in the Northwest. (7) Private shipping is helpful for demobilization transportation and should be quickly supported to promote its active development. (8) Railway materials should be manufactured using self-made rails and accessories. Highway vehicles should also be manufactured by setting up factories. Transportation technical employees must be actively trained and cultivated in large quantities, and their salaries and benefits must be reasonably adjusted. (9) The telecommunications business should be improved to achieve speed and accuracy. The scope and limits of the central and local governments and other institutions that handle communication business should be clearly defined in order to be practical. The military telegraph lines that have been temporarily set up in various places should be properly adjusted.

### Marshall to go to Washington

Senate Foreign Relations Committee to Report on Sino-Soviet Relations

[United Press, Long Beach, California, 14th] President Truman's special envoy to China, Marshall, returned to the country to report on his duties. He arrived here by plane today and transferred to Washington. It is said that after meeting with President Truman, he will return to China, which may not take more than a few days. When asked by reporters whether he agreed with foreign governments sending representatives to observe the Pacific atomic bomb test in May, Marshall did not answer.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th] The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee plans to ask Secretary of State Byrnes to report on the current international situation and to ask Marshal Marshall to report on Sino-Soviet relations.

[United Press, Yan'an, 14th] The CCP generally believes that President Truman's special envoy to China, Marshall, has "completely succeeded" in his mission in China. According to Communist Army Commander Zhu De, Marshall should still return to China. China still faces many difficulties in the future and needs his support.

### Soviet Trains from North and South Pass Through Harbin to the East; Soviet Troops Near Harbin Have a Look of Mold-Breaking

[Our Newspaper, Harbin, 14th] After the news of the Soviet troops withdrawing from Fanyang reached here, the people were excited and hoped that the national army could advance as soon as possible. Yang Zuoren, a member of the military representative delegation, arrived in Harbin today, perhaps to negotiate with the Soviet army. The personnel of the Heilongjiang and Hejiang provincial governments are scheduled to leave Harbin on the 19th and return to Changchun, which will not affect the overall takeover of the Northeast. The Harbin municipal government is facing extreme financial difficulties, but various tasks are still being actively promoted.

[Central News Agency, Harbin, 14th] At noon on the 14th, thirteen Soviet military trains from the north and south arrived in Harbin. Except for a small number of them getting off at Harbin Station, the rest went east. Soviet troops in various places near Harbin are also concentrating in Harbin, preparing to move. Currently, every day there are long snake trains full of goods heading towards Suifenhe and Zhalantun.

[United Press, Chongqing, 14th] According to the government's telegram received today, seven trains carrying the withdrawing Soviet troops from Shenyang have passed through Changchun, and they should be heading to Siberia. The remaining Fanyang garrison troops stationed in Changchun will also depart soon. Underground elements active in the suburbs of Shenyang were previously suspected of cooperating with the CCP, but now they have joined the national army. At the same time, it is reported that tens of thousands of Communist troops are moving from Faku, more than 130 miles north of Shenyang, towards Fushun. Another 40,000 Communist troops are advancing towards Pingquan, which is more than 400 miles west of Jinzhou. According to observations, it is suspected that this is the aftermath of the assassination of Li Zhaolin, president of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.

### Excellent Order in Shenyang; Garrison Headquarters to be Established Today

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 15th dispatch] This morning at 10:50 AM, this reporter inquired about the situation in Shenyang via a long-distance call to Director Peng Bisheng in Shenyang. According to him, the city is in excellent order, but all water and electricity have been cut off since last night. This is likely due to the destruction of the power plant at Fangzizui in Dongdaying, which was occupied by the Communist forces. Currently, there is also a large-scale power plant in Hunhepu, on the south bank of the Hun River, which was recently occupied by the Communist forces. National troops have been dispatched this morning to take over. It is unknown whether there will be a conflict. The Shenyang Garrison Headquarters will be established on the morning of the 16th, with Zhao Gongwu as commander and Peng Bisheng as deputy commander. After the headquarters is established, the forward command post will be closed. Peng also said that the Shenyang airfield is currently defended by the National troops and there may be an aircraft landing at the airfield for the first time today. Note: This is the first time this reporter has spoken by telephone with Shenyang since 9:00 PM on the 13th. The telephone connection between Changchun and Shenyang seems unstable and the Tie Ling telephone bureau has not yet resumed operations.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 15th dispatch] The head of the military delegation, Dong Yanping, flew back here from Jinzhou at noon today. Also, Yang Zuoren, a member of the delegation, took a car to Harbin yesterday and may return to Changchun within days with the chairmen of the Hejiang and Heilongjiang provinces and the receiving personnel who are stranded in Harbin.

### Joint Meeting of the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Committee and the Constitution Drafting Group Held Again Yesterday; Constitution Draft Review Meeting to be Convened on the 19th

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th dispatch] The Joint Committee of the Political Consultative Conference’s Comprehensive Committee and the Constitution Drafting Committee’s Negotiation Group held its second joint meeting at the National Government at 8:00 PM on the 15th, presided over by Chairman Sun Ke.

(2) Regarding the relationship between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan, the Legislative Yuan's power of no confidence in the Executive Yuan and the Executive Yuan's power to dissolve the Legislative Yuan are cancelled. (3) The provision allowing provinces to formulate provincial constitutions is changed to allow provinces to formulate provincial autonomous regulations or provincial special regulations. The drafting of the constitution based on the above points, such as the powers of the National Assembly, will be discussed by the Constitution Draft Review Committee.

### Northern Section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Reopened to Hanzhuang

[This newspaper, Xuzhou, 14th dispatch] The repair work on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is progressing smoothly, and it has now been reopened to Hanzhuang. The construction work east of Damiao on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway is also progressing well. Vice Minister Ling Hongxun of the Ministry of Communications and personnel from the Transportation Team, who recently visited the repair areas of the two railways to conduct on-site inspections, expressed great satisfaction. Vice Minister Ling concluded his work in Xuzhou and departed for Kaifeng, Zhengzhou and other places this morning for inspections.

### Remnants of the Japanese Kwantung Army Lurking in Various Parts of the Northeast

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 15th dispatch] According to someone who participated in the work of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association in Harbin in the early days of the Northeast's recovery: Li Zhaolin, the head of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association in Harbin, and Yu Shuzhong, the head of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association in Sipingjie, were assassinated and killed successively. These two shocking bloody cases seem to be subtly related to the Japanese terrorist organization called the "Violent Killing Group," which was recently uncovered under the control of the Soviet army in the Northeast. Insidious elements of the Japanese Kwantung Army lurking in various parts of the Northeast have been carrying out their pro-Soviet espionage against China and promoting the Communists while suppressing the Nationalists under the various complex situations created by the Northeast issue in the past. The so-called "unpredictability" means that they only seek benefits for the restoration of Japan, and it does not hurt to be friendly today and kill tomorrow, so as to confuse any powerful figures on the land of the Northeast. It is heard that they have provided convenience for the survival of these people, such as the Soviet army and the Chinese Communists, without exception. They are deeply convinced of the strength of these people, and they have been working together in Siberia with hundreds of thousands of Japanese prisoners of war. Sensitive and capable Soviet intelligence agents are also helpless. It is not that they do not know, but because they underestimate the situation and are eager to use them, which has caused this to happen. Currently, nine principal culprits of this type of violent killing group have been arrested, and fifteen suspects have been identified, but it is not difficult to catch them all in one fell swoop. It only requires mutual trust between China and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union to fulfill its promises, withdraw from the Northeast, and remove the clouds of suspicion. These people will then find it difficult to carry out their deceitful tricks in broad daylight.

[This newspaper, Harbin, 14th dispatch] There are clues to the Li Zhaolin case and it can be solved within days.

### Increasing Revenue for Counties and Cities; Increased Allocation of Taxes

[This newspaper, Chongqing, 15th dispatch] Considering that the local financial resources of various counties and cities are limited and the expenditures are huge, resulting in the situation of local apportionment, the relevant authorities, in order to increase the administrative and economic prosperity of various counties and cities, have heard that starting from this year, the share of land tax revenue allocated to various counties and cities will be increased to 25% for local revenue, and the share of business tax will be increased to 50%.

### Reorganization of Troops by the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters

[This newspaper, Xuzhou, 14th dispatch] The various troops under the jurisdiction of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, in accordance with the central government's regulations, began reorganization on the 15th. Regarding the placement of surplus officers and soldiers, it is heard that a comprehensive solution has been drafted.

### Iran and Turkey Clearly Express Determination to Defend National Territory; Rumor that the United States Has Agreed to Help Iran Safeguard Sovereignty; Soviet Side Denies Moving Troops in Iran

[This newspaper's news] London, 15th broadcast: The powder keg of the Middle East is closer to exploding today. Iranian Army Chief Yamadi told the press today: Soviet motorized troops have advanced from the Turkish border towards northern Iran, but the Iranian army is prepared to resist to the last man to defend the Iranian capital.

In the past few days, Soviet troops in various parts of Iran have increased three to fourfold.

[This newspaper's news] London, 15th broadcast: According to the London Chronicle, the United States has agreed to help the Iranian government, and when necessary, the United States will help Iran drive Soviet troops out of the country. It is said that the US Ambassador to Iran, Murray, visited Pahlavi, the de facto ruler of Iran, and assured him that the United States is determined to help Iran safeguard its sovereignty.

[This newspaper's news] London, 15th broadcast: The Iranian Embassy in the United States today confirmed that Iran will raise a complaint about the issue of Soviet troops stationed in Iran at the Security Council meeting on the 25th.

Also, a train of Soviet troops arrives at the Karaj station, 23 miles northwest of the Iranian capital, every other night, carrying tanks, artillery, etc. At the same time, motorized trucks also arrive there with a large number of Soviet infantry.

[United Press, Washington, 14th dispatch] According to a TASS dispatch broadcast by Moscow Radio tonight: "The reports from the United States about Soviet troops moving in Iran have no factual basis. The US State Department said that Soviet troops are moving south through Tabriz towards Tehran and the western border of Iran. This news agency is authorized to issue a statement that this is absolutely untrue."

[United Press, Istanbul, 14th dispatch] Turkey is still fully mobilized. Today, it was heard that Soviet combat troops are moving south in Iran and going straight down along the Turkish-Iraqi border. Upon hearing the news, everyone was stunned and remained silent. There was no direct reaction from the government officials, but the government authorities said that Turkey would not tolerate aggression and is willing to fight. The purpose of the Soviet troop movement has not yet been determined, but diplomatic circles claim that this may be a strategy to exert pressure on Turkey, intending to obtain the provinces of Kars and Ardahan, which the Soviet Union demanded in June last year. The Turkish army is currently maintaining wartime strength, with approximately one million soldiers. According to a dispatch from Ankara, the news of the Soviet troop movement was received there with more composure than in Istanbul, but with close attention. This time, the Soviet Union's deployment of troops on the southeastern border of Turkey is actually equivalent to military encirclement, because the northeastern border of Turkey faces Georgia, the east has Armenia and Iran, and the north is bounded by the Black Sea. Only the southern border with Iraq has no Soviet troops.

(2) These troops include armored units. (3) Soviet troops have withdrawn from the cities of Shahmna, Sharud, and Meshed in northeastern Iran.

### Truman's Remarks to Reporters: Current International Situation Not Surprising; Denies Disagreements with Secretary of State; Hopes to Attend the Security Council Meeting

[Reuters, Washington, 15th dispatch] President Truman stated at his weekly press conference yesterday that the current international situation did not surprise him. He avoided answering questions about US-Soviet relations, only saying: "I do not believe the situation is as dangerous as some people imagine." The President said there are no plans to hold a Big Three meeting, and he has not recently had any contact with Stalin on international issues. The President stated that he could not provide more information about the movement of the Red Army in Iran, and also declined to comment on Stalin's criticism of Churchill. A reporter also asked the President to comment on the statement made by the former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Harriman, that "the Soviet Union is only bluffing," which was also rejected. Before holding the press conference yesterday, the President met with Harriman for about half an hour. President Truman said that the United Nations Security Council will hold its next meeting in New York on March 25 as scheduled, and he hopes to attend the first meeting, but the final decision will depend on developments in Washington. The President reiterated that he believes that military leaders should first be consulted on the control of atomic energy, but the main control power should be given to civilian officials directly responsible to the President.

[United Press, Washington, 14th dispatch] President Truman said at a press conference that rumors of disagreements between him and Secretary of State Byrnes are unfounded.

[Also] The United Nations Security Council has scheduled a meeting in New York on March 25. If Iran does not raise the case of its complaint against the Soviet Union at the London meeting, the US government will ask the Council to discuss it again.

### "Security" - A Beautiful Name!

The territory annexed by the Soviet Union under this pretext has reached more than 270,000 square miles

[Central News Agency, New York, 15th dispatch] The New York Times acknowledges the Soviet Union's right to demand security, but at the same time points out that the Soviet Union has annexed more than 270,000 square miles of land and more than 24 million people in this war under the name of security. We have reason to ask where the Soviet Union's pursuit of security will stop? Where does its expansion begin?

### Iranian Prime Minister Issues First Order

[United Press, Tehran, 14th dispatch] Iranian Prime Minister Sadr, issued his first order today since taking office last month, banning public political gatherings and demonstrations.

### Churchill to Speak Again Today

### Amidst Reports of Soviet Troops Moving Towards the Turkish Border, British and American Fleets to Visit Turkey; Battleships and Aircraft Carriers to Accompany

[United Press, Atlantic City, New Jersey, 15th dispatch] Authoritative British sources announced today that a powerful unit of the British Mediterranean Fleet is preparing to join the US battleship Missouri in visiting Turkey to return the remains of Turkish Ambassador to the United States Ertegun. Ertegun passed away in Washington in 1944. The source of this news did not want to be named, but it is sufficient to show that the United Kingdom and the United States are clearly determined to maintain their friendship with Turkey. According to the State Department, the Missouri will only lead the destroyer Power to the Mediterranean as an escort. The British side said that a number of units of the British Mediterranean Fleet will join the Missouri and Power, and may also include several aircraft carriers. One of Britain's largest battleships may also join the trip. The US State Department insisted that the dispatch of the largest warship to the Mediterranean at this time has no military relationship. This mission has a precedent to follow, but in view of the report of Soviet troops moving towards the Turkish border in Iran, this news is inevitably of diplomatic significance.

### Mrs. Roosevelt's Insightful Words

The English-speaking nations cannot survive alone without non-English-speaking people.

[United Press, Washington, 15th dispatch] The Joint Committee of Women Members of the Senate and House of Representatives hosted a banquet today for the late President Roosevelt's wife, with more than a thousand people attending. Mrs. Roosevelt said in her speech that Churchill led Britain in the war and made great contributions, but "We should recognize that although the English-speaking people are strong, they cannot survive without a larger number of non-English-speaking people."

### Retrospect of Soviet-Turkish Relations

[United Press, Washington, 14th dispatch] The frequent movement of Soviet troops in Iran has caused the world to pay close attention to the Soviet Union's demands on Turkey again. The provinces of Kars and Ardahan on the Caucasian border were ceded to Turkey according to the 1921 treaty. The Soviet Union demanded that Turkey return the two provinces, and also demanded a base in the Dardanelles Strait. However, according to Turkish spokespersons, Turkey will reject this demand and will not hesitate to fight. The Soviet Union and Turkey have historically been incompatible, and the previous territorial disputes are only the obvious ones. The Soviet Union notified the termination of the 1925 Soviet-Turkish Friendship Treaty in March last year, and Soviet newspapers accused Turkey of having too close relations with Germany. Since the 18th century, the Soviet Union and Turkey have never maintained a long-term genuine friendly relationship. The two countries had several conflicts over territorial issues in 1736, 1768, 1792, 1812, and 1853. In 1877, the Soviet Union and Turkey went to war again, resulting in the Kars Plateau being incorporated into the Soviet Union. In the 9th and 10th centuries, Armenians established a government in Kars, and disputes have continued ever since. During the First World War, although Turkey was a defeated country, the two provinces of Kars and Ardahan finally belonged to Turkey by means of a referendum in 1912, and Turkey also recognized the Soviet government for this reason.

### Editorial: Churchill's Speech

Churchill, the former Prime Minister of the British wartime government, recently delivered two speeches in the United States, one at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, on March 5, and the other at the Virginia State Legislature on March 8. Although the wording of the two speeches is different, the main points are to raise the vigilance of British and American people and advocate that English-speaking nations should strengthen their unity to cope with the changing world. In the speech at Westminster College in Fulton, Churchill frankly said: "Unless the English-speaking people are united as brothers, it will still be difficult to prevent war or promote the organization of world institutions. The United Kingdom and the United States must not only maintain a spirit of friendship and mutual understanding, but also need military advisers from both countries to maintain close relations to study potential crises, and then they can cultivate fraternal unity. It is also necessary to jointly use the naval and air force bases owned by the two countries around the world to ensure mutual security. The Dark Ages may return, and good times do not last long. The victory of the Allies has now been overshadowed, and we should be vigilant." He also said: "I greatly admire the courage and resilience of the Russian people and Comrade Stalin. The United Kingdom still sympathizes with and treats the entire Russian nation with goodwill, and will always maintain permanent friendship with it. The ancient countries of Central and Eastern Europe are now all within the Soviet sphere of influence. However, the concept of honor will be decided under the supervision of the British, American, and French inspectors in future elections. The Communist parties in Eastern European countries are originally in the minority. It is feared that it will be difficult for them to be competent for the responsibilities they bear now that they are emerging, and they even want to strive for totalitarian rule. Except for Czechoslovakia, there is no real democratic politics in the rest of the countries. The oppression exerted by the Soviet Union on Turkey and the situation of the Russian Communist Party in Germany are not what we want to see in the construction after the liberation of Europe, nor are they elements sufficient to constitute lasting peace."

Since Churchill's speech was published, this newspaper has never made any comments. This is because Churchill, in his capacity as a commoner after leaving office, gave the speech, so it was not necessary to pay attention to it. Moreover, the target audience of Churchill's speech was the American audience, and the need for English-speaking nations to strengthen their unity to cope with the changing world has nothing to do with our involvement. The Soviet Union also remained silent about Churchill's speech until March 13, when the Moscow "Pravda" published an interview between the newspaper's reporter and Marshal Stalin. Stalin criticized Churchill's remarks. According to a United Press dispatch from London on the 13th, Moscow Radio broadcast an interview between Marshal Stalin and a Pravda reporter. Stalin said that Churchill's speech, some of which involved Poland, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Hungary, was a lie. He also said: Churchill's speech was very dangerous. Churchill advocated war against the Soviet Union... He not only has people in the United Kingdom who echo his demands, but also in the United States. But it must be pointed out that Churchill and his friends remind people of Hitler and his friends. Hitler adopted racial theories to establish his war doctrine, declaring that only those who speak Germanic languages are pure races. Churchill also used racial theories to incite war, conferring privileges on the English-speaking nations and giving them the right to determine the fate of the world. … Churchill and his friends in the United Kingdom and the United States are now issuing an ultimatum to non-English-speaking countries: "If you automatically acknowledge our superiority, everything will be fine; otherwise, war is inevitable."

After Marshal Stalin made this statement, Churchill himself refused to comment, but British and American public opinion criticized it. The London Daily Mail said: Marshal Stalin's personal abuse of Churchill is despicable and regrettable, and these are not words that a politician should have. Hearing his words can make one imagine his person. His interpretation of the current international crisis can only explain that the world's tension is caused by the Soviet Union's power politics and aggression against neighboring countries, but it cannot absolve the Soviet Union of its responsibility. The New York Times said: If the Soviet Union believes that the hesitation shown by the US Congress towards Churchill's speech is an opportunity to split the friendly relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States, it is a mistake. The newspaper also said that if the Soviet Union wants to give Churchill an effective answer, what Moscow needs to do is to abide by the guarantees, agreements, and treaties it has made with other countries.

What surprises us is that Churchill's speech, made in his capacity as a commoner, was criticized by the highest authorities in the Soviet Union. We are neither the so-called English-speaking nation, nor is the Soviet Union our great ally, so we do not want to comment on Churchill's speech and Stalin's reply. However, precisely because we are not the so-called English-speaking nation, if we want to use Hitler's racial theory to counterattack, it is not difficult to discover the direction of sympathy in the minds of the Chinese people. Hitler and his friends were defeated, but where exactly does Hitlerism now appear in the world?

### England Sends Another Note to the Soviet Union Questioning Intentions in Iran; Bevin Says Current Soviet Policy Inexplicable

[United Press, London, 15th] A spokesperson for the British Foreign Office stated today that Britain has sent a note to the Soviet Union questioning its intentions in Iran. Until a reply is received, it cannot be determined whether the Soviet Union's Middle East policy is aggressive or defensive in nature. News from Canberra indicates that Australian Foreign Minister Evatt stated in the Australian Parliament that Australia believes Soviet policy aims at defense, a view shared by Britain.

[United Press, London, 14th] Foreign Secretary Bevin reported to the House of Commons today on the urgent situation in Iran, stating that any settlement between Iran and the Soviet Union while Soviet troops remain in Iran would clearly be obtained under duress, which Britain would view with regret. Soviet troops are currently still stationed in Iran, but whether Britain will redeploy troops to the troubled areas of Iran has not yet been decided. The British government has also not taken any steps to negotiate with the Iranian government regarding the return of British troops to Iran. The current policy of the Soviet government is particularly inexplicable to the British government, and the fact that all the guarantees it has provided have not been fulfilled is especially unbelievable.

### Shanghai to New York: Reachable in 28 and a Half Hours

[Reported by this newspaper] London, 15th Broadcasting: British Prime Minister Attlee announced today that the British government's delegation to India, organized by key figures, is about to depart.

[Reuters, Bombay, 15th] Yesterday, in a public prayer meeting, Gandhi instructed the Indian people to remain patient in order to give the British delegation an opportunity to fulfill the British government's promises. However, Gandhi also said that if the delegation brings false promises again, he will lead the people to take the next appropriate steps. The Congress Party may appoint the party chairman Acharya, Gandhi's right-hand man Patel, and former chairman Nehru to form a committee to negotiate with the British delegation. During the negotiations, the Congress Party Executive Committee will continue to hold meetings in Delhi, and Gandhi will also remain in Delhi.

### Local Correspondences

Suzhou

Three Major Traitors to be Publicly Prosecuted

The three major traitors Chen Gongbo, Chu Minyi, and Chen Bijun were transferred from Nanjing to Suzhou on the 17th of last month and detained in the detention center. Chief Prosecutor Han of the Suzhou High Court Prosecutor's Office, in order to handle this case with caution, specially dispatched Prosecutor Wei and Secretary Gu to Nanjing and Shanghai to collect evidence. They have now returned to Suzhou with the evidence. On the afternoon of the 10th, Prosecutor Li, under the order of Chief Prosecutor Han, interrogated Chen Gongbo for about an hour, and Chen admitted that he was an undeniable culprit who harmed the country. On the afternoon of the 13th, Chief Prosecutor Han ordered Prosecutors Wei and Wang to summon Chen Bijun and Chu Minyi to court. The interrogation lasted for about an hour before it was completed. During the investigation, the High Court conducted the interrogation of this case very secretly. Because the evidence of the three traitors' crimes is undeniable, after one or two more interrogations, a public prosecution can be filed with the Criminal Division of the same court.

Jiangyin

Former County Magistrate Publicly Prosecuted

Former Magistrate He Peixuan, after being transferred to the Suzhou High Court, was investigated by Prosecutor Wang Wenzun. It was determined that the crime he committed should constitute the crime under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors. However, the defendant is 71 years old, and the crime was committed before June 1, 1944, so the sentence should be reduced according to law. During his time in the puppet government, he assisted in the anti-Japanese war and engaged in behaviors that benefited the people, so he may be given a lighter sentence. According to Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is filed.

### Military Strength of Middle Eastern Countries; Turkey and Iraq Have the Best Quality; British Troops Number Over 500,000

[Reuters, London, 15th] Although the official strength of British troops in the Middle East has not been fully announced, it is not difficult to estimate at present. The main concentrations of British troops in the Middle East are in Egypt, Palestine, and Iraq. Palestine is the center of operations for British troops in the Middle East. In addition to five army divisions, including one Indian division, three infantry divisions, and one paratrooper division, there are also approximately 100,000 personnel from the Royal Air Force and engineering corps. Although these are motorized armored units, there are no tanks stationed in Palestine. The barracks are already full, so it is impossible to increase troops. The British troops in Iraq are mainly air force, supplemented by some supply and guard units, and the number is far less than those in Palestine. Among the armies of the Middle Eastern countries, the armies of Turkey, Iraq, and Transjordan have the best quality. The Turkish army has approximately 500,000 troops, Iraq has approximately 16,000 mechanized troops trained and paid by the British. These troops are for self-defense and have never participated in modern warfare. The Syrian army has approximately 10,000 troops, and Lebanon has approximately 5,000 troops, both of which are domestic defense forces. The official number of Egyptian army personnel has not been announced, but it is estimated to be approximately 60,000. Prime Minister Attlee announced that the total number of British armed forces at home and abroad is 2 million, of which 1.2 million are army, and the navy and air force each account for 400,000. Subtracting the number of British occupation troops in Germany and Austria and the number of British troops in the Far East and India, the total number of British troops in the Middle East should be lower than the generally estimated number of 500,000 to 1 million. The Iranian army has approximately 90,000 troops, of which 45,000 have been trained, and the rest are recruits. Their equipment is outdated and unbearable, and there are deep political and social prejudices between officers and soldiers, only maintaining internal security.

### Housing Cooperative's First Step Plan: Building 2,000 Houses

The preparatory committee of the Shanghai Housing Cooperative held a standing committee meeting at the office of the special commissioner for cooperative affairs of the Ministry of Social Affairs on Daming Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from 15 agencies including the municipal government attended. Special Commissioner Chen Zhongming presided over the meeting. The draft articles of association were approved, and the name of the cooperative was changed to Shanghai First Housing Cooperative. The purpose of the cooperative is to build or rent houses collectively in the spirit of mutual assistance for the residence of its members. It will also provide various educational, health, transportation, and entertainment facilities to cultivate the collective life of its members. To solve the housing problem, three measures were decided: collectively building residential houses, with most of the construction costs being loaned from banks; ordering mobile homes from the United States, with the cooperative raising most of the refined flour; and negotiating with the Soviet-Jiangsu-Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau to allocate enemy and puppet houses for the use of the cooperative. Representatives from relevant agencies have been appointed to carry out the above three measures separately. Wang Yuankang, a representative of the Public Works Bureau, was appointed to be responsible for construction design, Zhang Shengwu, a representative of the Land Administration Bureau, was appointed to be responsible for geological survey, and Chen Zhongming, the special commissioner of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and Shen Shanhong, a representative of the Enemy Property Administration Bureau, were appointed to be responsible for negotiating with the Enemy Property Administration Bureau to allocate enemy and puppet houses.

### The Siam Delegation's Visit to China: Promoting Further Cooperation Between the Two Countries... A Visit to Delegation Head Yun Tianfu at the Cathay Hotel

— Our Newspaper Reporter, Mai Tian

"Although our purpose in coming to Shanghai is sightseeing, our purpose in coming to China is to promote diplomatic relations between China and Siam. Not only between the two countries but also to enable the people of China and Siam to further understand each other." Siam delegation leader Yun Tianfu said yesterday afternoon when he received our newspaper reporter at the Cathay Hotel.

Yun Tianfu is forty-four years old this year, but he looks no more than thirty. He is short in stature, very amiable, and speaks fluent English. He has been the Secretary of State of the Siamese government since 1939. His father was Chinese, but he grew up in Bangkok and is visiting China for the first time. Speaking of the conflicts between overseas Chinese and Siamese people, Yun said: "I can guarantee that this matter has absolutely no political background," nor does it have any anti-China tendency. For hundreds of years, China and Siam have intermarried, and Siam is like one family. Many Siamese people have Chinese ancestry, including myself. For hundreds of years, there has never been any discord between China and Siam, so the Siamese people will never be anti-China. This incident occurred last September, and the reasons were all due to minor matters, such as small conflicts in customs and habits between the two countries. However, such conflicts have recently subsided. There are currently more than two million Chinese residents in Siam, and tens of thousands in Bangkok. Regarding the issue of trade between China and Siam, according to Yun, the transportation problem is that Siam has no ships to transport goods for export. If China can facilitate transportation, mutual trade can begin. Currently, what Siam lacks most are textile raw materials and building materials. At present, Siamese rice exports are shipped by the UK under the Anglo-Siamese agreement and then distributed to other countries after consultation with Washington. Siam's own industry and commerce are not developed, and very few goods were imported during the war. The educational level of the people in Siam is quite high, with more than half having received considerable education. There are currently two universities and many other specialized schools and middle schools in Bangkok. There is also a "Women's Newspaper" in Bangkok, where all the staff except the printing workers are women. In terms of clothing, men and women mostly adopt European styles. The King of Siam is only twenty years old, unmarried, and has not yet been crowned. He previously studied politics at a university in Switzerland. Because he has not yet graduated, he will soon return to Switzerland to continue his studies. The Siamese political system is roughly based on the British system, but the king must be a Buddhist. Most of the people in power in Siam are Buddhists, and Yun and the other six delegation members are also Buddhists. Bangkok also suffered significant losses in the war, with 6,000 houses destroyed by bombing, so there is a great need for reconstruction. There are currently about 13,000 Japanese soldiers, 20,000 Japanese, and the British military authorities are assisting in repatriation.

The delegation departed for China on the 25th of last month and has visited Chongqing and Beiping. They have a good impression of Shanghai, but feel it is too cold, and the constant rain is unpleasant. The climate in Beiping is even colder, so it is no wonder that people accustomed to the tropics cannot stand it. Yun and others plan to go to Nanjing next Wednesday to set up the embassy. The candidate for the new ambassador has not yet been decided and may be transferred from the current ambassador to Switzerland. After going to Nanjing, they plan to go to Chongqing for about a week before heading south through Guangzhou to return home.

The City Chamber of Commerce Hosts a Tea Party, Hoping to Enhance Trade Relations

[Report from our newspaper] The City Chamber of Commerce held a tea party at 4:00 PM yesterday in the conference room of the chamber to host the Siam delegation.

First, Wang Xiaolai delivered a welcome speech, which was translated into Siamese by Liao Liejin. Then, Delegation Leader Yun delivered a reply speech in English, saying briefly: He expressed his gratitude for the warm welcome from all sectors of our country and said that when he was in Chongqing, the Minister of Food Xu Kan told him: he has consulted with the British Embassy on the transportation of 15,000 tons of rice to China. Since China sent a delegation to Siam, a delegation was specially formed to visit China to reciprocate. He firmly believes that after the two countries sign a Sino-Siamese friendship treaty, they will surely further enhance friendship and strengthen cooperation. He hoped that trade between the two countries can also increase day by day. He immediately presented a letter from the chairman of the Siam Chamber of Commerce, Lansen, to the City Chamber of Commerce, which mainly stated that he hoped that the chambers of commerce of the two countries can cooperate with each other to promote trade relations between China and Siam, and hoped to provide the delegation with the convenience of studying China's trade, transportation, finance, commerce and other conditions, and to cultivate and dredge trade routes. Also, at 8:15 last night, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs invited them to watch a movie at the Majestic Theatre. Mayor Qian has scheduled a banquet for all members of the delegation at his private residence at noon today.

### German Radio Military Commentator Peter Arrested; Important Documents Seized from His Residence; Transferred to the Court After Interrogation

Peter Enton Pankie, a Nazi Party member directly commanded by the German Fifth Column, a German radio military commentator, has been captured by the Inspection Office of our Party Headquarters. Peter is Russian, born in Siberia, and naturalized in Germany in Shanghai. Originally a construction engineer, he knew the details of the fortresses built by Russia in various parts of the Far East. He published many discourses on urban defense fortresses in Shanghai, so the Japanese side also attached great importance to him. It is said that Peter also made considerable contributions to the Japanese defense works around Shanghai. When the German radio station in Shanghai was established, Peter was hired as a Russian military commentator, wantonly attacking the Allied countries, and the materials were directly supplied by the Nazis and the Fifth Column. Until Germany surrendered, Peter issued the final broadcast, "Germany has surrendered, the war is over, this is just an ordinary thing. Germany must remain calm and maintain its dignity," and then left the radio station and hid in his residence at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Seymour Road. But he still had close contact with German Nazi personnel and the Japanese Naval News Department.

### Secretary-General of the Chamber of Commerce Talks About the New Company Law

[Report from our newspaper] For the rumor that the new Company Law will be implemented on April 1st this year, the reporter specially visited Mr. Yan Jiusheng, Secretary-General of the City Chamber of Commerce. According to reports, the saying that it will be implemented on April 1st was spread at a symposium held by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce last week, and its accuracy remains to be confirmed. However, whether the new Company Law is revised or not depends on how the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce is signed. It is now heard that the National Defense Supreme Committee advocates abolishing the provision in the new Company Law that foreign companies should have the words "business" in their home country, while the Legislative Yuan advocates retaining it. However, from the standpoint of pure scholars and legislators, it seems better to retain it.

### Labor Strikes and Prices: Cause and Effect - Salary Adjustments Barely Made Before Living Becomes a Problem Again - Social Bureau Labor Office Director Issues Statement

[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Jianhua, Director of the Labor Office of the Social Bureau, gave a statement to our newspaper reporter yesterday regarding the issue of labor strikes, saying: "Labor strikes occur due to high prices, but high prices are also caused by labor strikes."

"Because employers in various industries increase expenses due to salary adjustments for employees, they will inevitably raise the prices of goods to compensate. If one industry does this, all industries will do the same. As a result, employees' adjusted salaries are not enough to maintain their livelihoods, leading to further labor strikes. Therefore, labor strikes and prices have become inextricably linked, and labor strikes continue in a cycle."

"Endless Cycle"

"This situation is most obvious and very serious. The authorities are paying close attention to this and are determined to work hard to stabilize the financial situation and suppress prices in order to fundamentally resolve labor strikes. However, the wartime financial chaos is extreme, and it will take a considerable period of time to return to normal. During this difficult period, we hope that both labor and management will be patient for the time being, and it will not be difficult to get through it. The government has already taken various measures, such as opening up foreign exchange, so that overseas materials can flow in continuously; restoring transportation to make it smooth; and resuming factory work to increase production, etc., in order to stabilize the financial situation. If supplies return to normal, labor strikes can naturally be eliminated." Director Li anticipates that factory strikes in this city will subside after May of this year, but temporarily, it may still continue for some time.

Taikoo Wharf Workers Strike

More than a thousand workers at Taikoo Wharf went on strike collectively at 10:00 AM yesterday, making it impossible to unload the Taikoo ships that arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The reason for the strike is said to be that the workers have suffered extreme hardship due to the pressure of living expenses since 1939. Three days ago, the Taikoo head manager was reported to have arrived in Shanghai from England, so they jointly requested the head manager to provide subsidies for the losses of the past few years. The company authorities did not grant the request, which led to the strike.

Cinema Drivers

[Report from Our Newspaper] Drivers of various cinemas in this city submitted a request to management yesterday for a salary increase: $330 for first-run cinemas, $270 for second-run cinemas, $240 for third-run cinemas, and $210 for fourth-run cinemas.

Knitting Workers

[Report from Our Newspaper] Workers from eleven knitting machine factories, including Tianhua and Huasheng, requested a daily wage increase to between $3,000 and $4,000 per worker, but management only agreed to half of that amount.

Yesterday, they also went to the Social Bureau to request mediation.

Private Ship Carpentry

[Report from Our Newspaper] Workers from more than fifty carpentry businesses in the local, Ningbo, and private shipping industries have also begun slowdown strikes.

As a result, they are deadlocked, and the Social Bureau is currently mediating.

Egg Industry Employees

[Report from Our Newspaper] The monthly wages of more than six hundred employees from more than one hundred businesses in the egg industry are only between $4,000 and $5,000, which is not enough to cover living expenses. They requested a wage increase to between $30,000 and $60,000 from management on the 8th of last month. As it has not been resolved, all employees began a slowdown strike from the day before yesterday. However, the older Minnan people can still sell eggs themselves and are not affected. Therefore, the employees went to the Social Bureau yesterday to request mediation.

Tram Workers

[Report from Our Newspaper] Fifty-seven veteran workers in the mechanical department of the British-owned tram company were dismissed by the Japanese before the victory.

Sales improved near noon, with securities firms and general idle funds also absorbing. When the black market recovered, the authorities were unwilling to respond to the market at the 1,600,000 price. The afternoon turned stable, with limited transactions, and the overall trend remained sideways. It was observed that it opened at 1,560,000 with buyers, the situation was stable, and gradually improved. General predictions were lower than the previous day's market price, and the Central Bank was unwilling to supply, so around 10:00, it was approaching 1,600,000. When the Central Bank's allocation registration of 153 bars, priced at 1,600,000, was officially decided, it initially seemed difficult for the industry to accept, but buyers quickly became active. At noon, it had exceeded the 1,600,000 mark. The afternoon continued to stabilize, and the final price reached a high of 1,640,000, resulting in a recovery of about 60,000 compared to the previous close. Jewelry gold was priced as high as 176,000 yuan, refined silver was 1,600 yuan, silver dollars were slightly weak and sold at 890 yuan, dark interest rates were flat, interest rates ranged from 1.5 to 2 jiao, and the cash position seemed to be balanced.

The foreign exchange market was stable for U.S. dollars, and the situation was not as active as the Shanghai gold market. The difference with gold consistently hovered around 780 yuan per ten taels. It opened in the morning at 2,020 yuan for buying and 2,040 yuan for selling. After opening, the gold market strengthened, and the dollar market also improved slightly, but it was extremely peaceful. The afternoon was the same, hovering around 2,050 yuan, and finally closed slightly higher by 20 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong tickets were also stable yesterday. Old tickets finally closed about 10 yuan better, new goods were in demand, and tickets issued in 1936 rose by 5 yuan, as did those issued in 1937. Idle funds were active, and buying interest was strong. Hong Kong telegrams were 435 yuan, and Robbies were 525 yuan, all with settlements.

### Stock Market Emerges as a Dark Horse - Idle Funds Favor Sino Land - Small-Cap Stocks Close at Their Peaks

Government bonds continued to trade sideways yesterday, but the hot A-bonds were being taken off the market.  They failed to strengthen along with gold and stock prices. A-bonds initially opened struggling around 1,750 yuan. After reaching 1,780 yuan, they were contained by profit-taking from the bulls, retreating to around 1,580 yuan before recovering slightly and hovering around 1,650 yuan. The noon close was 100 yuan lower for both A and E bonds compared to the previous close. Miscellaneous bonds did not fall much. Shanghai stocks were thinking of risk at high levels, so large-cap stocks traded sideways after reaching highs, while small-cap stocks made vigorous progress. Jingfu and Xinguang advanced without retreating, and Qinheng's background was inferior. Although it was pulled up, there were many retracements. Yarn factories opened in the morning at 4,000 yuan, Meiya at 3,100 yuan, and Jingfu at 220 yuan. After opening, they were slightly lower, with yarn factories reaching 3,950 yuan, Meiya 3,000 yuan, and Jingfu 215 yuan, before starting to rebound. Xinguang from 190 yuan, Qinheng from 145 yuan, trading sideways and rising. Sino Land attracted focused funds. After reaching 630 yuan, general buyers emerged as a dark horse, competing with Xinguang in glory. After reaching highs before noon, they retreated slightly. Yong yarn reached 4,200 yuan, and Meiya 3,300 yuan, but small-cap stocks still closed at their peaks. Compared to the previous close, Yong yarn and Meiya rose slightly, but Sino Land soared by more than 150 yuan, with many buyers still around. Jingfu and other three small hot stocks rose again by 20 yuan to 35 yuan each. In the afternoon, next-day settlement was available. Yong yarn rose to 4,300 yuan, Meiya 3,350 yuan, and Jingfu 250 yuan before stabilizing slightly. However, apart from these three, there was little activity. Foreign stocks were stable. In general, large-cap stocks fell slightly, and small-cap stocks rose slightly.

### Central Bank Prepares to Restore Tianjin and Beijing Exchange Markets

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Bank recently plans to open foreign exchange markets in both Tianjin and Beijing. Preparations are now actively underway. Once the personnel deployment is completed and contact is established with the local customs offices, it can begin to restore operations. The exchange rates for the British pound and other countries have not yet been announced. It is reported that the person in charge of the Central Bank had already instructed the heads of British banks to devise methods at the beginning of the opening of the foreign exchange market so that there would be a framework to follow for the settlement of trade between China and Britain after the exchange rates were announced. However, due to various issues, everything is still under discussion.

Another report: Since the Foreign Exchange Examination Office of the Central Bank began accepting applications for types A and B foreign exchange businesses, two weeks have passed quickly. To date, there are more than 130 applications for type A businesses and only two for type B. It is reported that the deadline for applications will be the 19th of this month.

### Yarn and Cotton Stable, Speculators Gradually Become Bored

The yarn market was still relatively stable yesterday. Although sales to customers were not very smooth, sporadic transactions were still coming in steadily. Twenty-count medium-grade brands such as Da Feiting (Big Airship) and Shenhu (Magic Tiger) yarn were being inquired about. Sixteen-count yarn was not as popular as before, because cotton mills were taking a wait-and-see attitude. The Fang Jian company opened sales yesterday for thirteen kinds of printed cotton cloth and also added twelve kinds of American cloth. It is reported that hemp, wool, and woolen products will be sold as usual today.

Yesterday, New York American cotton prices fell by 8 to 20 points. The near-term price was US$26.95, the far-term price was 26.42, and the spot price for midlings was 27.23. Bombay Indian cotton prices fell by 23 Robbies. The price for Pingger was 46.5, for Amuera 47.75, for white cotton the near-term price was 48.25, and the far-term price was 48.6. The local cotton market continued to follow American and Indian cotton and was flat and weak. However, transactions were still strong due to the urgent need for fine-grade raw materials by Fang Jian company and Shenxin and other factories. In total, there were as many as 2,300 to 400 bales. Purchase prices were similar except for ginned cotton, which fell by 1,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Rice Prices Firm

Prices of foreign rice from the Relief Administration may hopefully fall slightly

The rice market was weak in the morning and stabilized in the afternoon, with results similar to yesterday. The Taiwanese flour market had declined, and the market stabilized. Oil prices showed a slight upward trend, rising by 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan. Dou Bing was agitated but not strong. The price each rose by 100 yuan or 200 yuan. There were not many transactions of yellow soybeans, and the market was peaceful. Bran was also less affected by ups and downs, and raw peanuts also lacked fluctuations. The corn market was sluggish, and both sesame arrivals and consumption were weak, and the situation was mediocre. Cotton cakes and vegetable cakes still did not see breathing, and grain temporarily tended to trade sideways. If the weather turns sunny, rice prices may fall slightly, but it will not fall too much before the foreign rice of the Relief Administration arrives in Shanghai.

### Coal Arrives Steadily

The source of coal is smooth. The British ship "William J. Thornycroft" brought 9,000 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao. It anchored outside Wusongkou for three days. Due to the lack of docks, the original "Zhongshan" ship was anchored on the 32nd and 33rd buoys and sailed to Qinhuangdao to load coal yesterday. The British ship entered the port and anchored on the buoy to unload coal. It was also reported that the Fuel Management Committee purchased a large amount of white coal in Viet Portampha and began to transport it to Shanghai. The first ship, the "Mary Lyon", brought 9,400 tons of white coal from the port and is expected to arrive tomorrow. Also, the "Halter Maller" will leave Shanghai Harbor on Tuesday to transport coal to that port. The Fuel Committee also leased the Taikoo Company's "Nanchang" ship in Hong Kong, which will sail directly from Hong Kong to that port to transport coal to Shanghai within days. A large number of white coal will soon arrive in Shanghai, and Qinhuangdao and Keelung coal will also arrive steadily. The supply of fuel is gradually becoming sufficient.

### Tung Oil Exports Inactive, Domestic and Foreign Prices Not Close

After the foreign exchange regulations were established, export transactions of white tung oil could have been active, but because they failed to meet American prices, export business was still touch-and-go. In recent years, the production of tung oil areas has sharply decreased due to blocked exports, so arrivals are not strong and prices cannot be too low. According to news from Hangzhou, the price is around 66,000 yuan or 67,000 yuan. Although the wholesale price of various companies in this city is set at 72,000 yuan or 73,000 yuan, sales are not very smooth, and it is feared that the future market will not be good for a while. It is reported that Hongjiang tung oil has arrived in Shanghai from Xifucheng. The wholesale price of each brand is between 60,000 yuan per barrel.

### American Businesses Peddling Large Quantities of Dyes - 4/5 Lower Than Shanghai Prices

Recently, the Shanghai market for pigments and dyes has seen increased demand due to the successive resumption of work by various dye factories, and many customers are competing to purchase, so prices are gradually increasing. In the midst of this rising price and shortage, it is reported that the American Farak Dye Factory has entrusted a certain metal company in this city to sell a large quantity of dyes in China. Its price is about 4/5 lower than the current Shanghai price. It will open for business this week, and several dye factories have already pre-ordered. The ordering procedure is as follows: after the purchaser determines the products they need to order, they sign a contract with the distributor. The purchaser pays the full amount of the price converted into US dollars at the current official rate to any bank in Shanghai, such as Citibank or HSBC, which will be transferred to New York, and the receiving bank guarantees receipt of payment. It is reported that the goods will be delivered to Shanghai within two months from the date of payment. The purchaser is responsible for the shipping costs and insurance fees from New York to Shanghai, which amount to approximately US$4 per ton.

### Summary of Commercial Conditions

Longans: Because of quiet sales, the prices of miscellaneous large-grain longans have fallen. 100 to 200 pieces were sold at 68,000 yuan. The market is still preventing them from falling further.

Industrial Raw Materials: The market continues to be weak, people are bearish, arrivals continue, and prices are falling across the board.

Silk: Because new factory silk has not yet been produced, there are only limited old goods traded on the market, and prices remain stable. 150-denier Tianqiao semi-luster artificial silk has buyers, and the price has risen. There is little movement in the rest of the products. Meiya bed sheets opened in the morning and remained at the original price. Later, because the Suzhou retailers had a slight interest, the price rose by 30,000 yuan compared to yesterday's market. Dacheng bed sheets also rose by 20,000 yuan. Dacheng blue crepe slightly rose by 157 yuan because it is the season. The rest was flat.

Cigarettes: There were slight differences in the opening prices in the morning. British and American cigarettes were traded more actively and showed a slight upward trend. Except for Beauty and Golden Mouse, the rest of the Chinese factory cigarettes fell slightly.

Chinese Medicine: The arrival of Su Kuai Shi Huang and Lao Kou is still limited, but their appetite has increased slightly, rising by 2,000 yuan and 1,000 yuan, respectively. Ginseng bird's nest has recently arrived, and its price is nearly 10% weaker than the market price. The rest is flat.

Tea: The tea market has been inactive in recent days. Buyers hesitated and bought only what they needed. Cargo owners who wanted to take profits were eager to sell.

### Letter

A letter from the Shanghai Agricultural Products Market states that, having read the report "Questions Arise About the Organization of the Agricultural Products Market" published in your newspaper on March 14, we are providing point-by-point answers below to correct the record.

(1) The Shanghai Agricultural Products Market is of course different in nature from the puppet Central Market. The Agricultural Products Market is an organization that regulates production and sales and balances supply and demand, with the aim of suppressing prices in a legitimate way through a rational system.

(2) The highest commission charged by the former puppet Central Market was 28%. The Agricultural Products Market's supervisory committee decided to charge a management fee of 1% of the transaction amount. It is self-evident whether this is a disguised form of taxation.

(3) If goods are transported to the market and managed in a unified manner, accurate statistics can be made to assist merchants in preparing for centralized procurement and sales.

(4) The market is a place for centralized trading, which is of great convenience to both supply and demand. The statement that incoming goods will inevitably be diverted to other ports is a blatant distortion of the facts.

(5) The municipal government's notice and the market's announcement inform the relevant industries and firms not to abandon their own interests and to quickly participate in business in order to achieve the mission of establishing the market. There is no coercion whatsoever.

Education and Sports

### Professors at the Capital Provisional University Face Challenges - Deputy Minister Hang Promises to Forward Relief Request to the Executive Yuan - Will Also Come to Shanghai to Talk with University Professors

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing] Professors Guo Shouchun, Shi Shiyuan, Ding Shan, and Pan Zunxing from the Capital Provisional University's Remedial Class, citing high living expenses and professor salaries that are lower than bank employees, telegraphed the Ministry of Education, appealing for relief. They also raised concerns about the future prospects of students in the remedial class after the completion of their studies. Deputy Minister Hang Liwu of the Ministry of Education scheduled a meeting with the professors at the Ministry of Education at around 4:00 PM on the 13th. The professors presented their opinions, and Deputy Minister Hang answered them one by one. Everyone deeply understood the Ministry of Education. Deputy Minister Hang stated that the high cost of living in Beijing and Shanghai is no less than that in Kunming. He promised to forward to the Executive Yuan the information on the meager salaries of the education sector, which are actually insufficient to cover living expenses, and request relief.

Planning for the Future Prospects of Students in Remedial Classes

The Ministry of Education has a comprehensive plan for the future prospects of students in remedial classes. Students who pass the exam and meet the requirements will have a solution when the time comes. Deputy Minister Hang also stated that he will travel to Shanghai in the near future to invite university professors in Shanghai for a discussion on salary issues. (Fool)

Resolving the Salaries of Faculty and Staff in Preparatory Classes

[Another Report] Li Jiansu, Chen Jieff, Jing Younan, and Wang Dehe, faculty and staff members of the Capital Provisional University's Guangxiu Class, petitioned the Ministry of Education at 2:00 PM on the 12th, stating that their class had only received funding for January so far, while other schools, such as the Provisional University's Remedial Class and the three National Temporary Middle Schools, had received funding for February and March, and some had even been paid from October and November. Compared to the Preparatory Class, the treatment was too unequal. Deputy Minister Hang received them and promised to clear their salaries for February and March within a few days. It was also appropriately resolved that the starting salary would be calculated from the date of the appointment letter and that travel expenses would be subsidized. (Fool)

### Qingdao Municipal High School Changes to Full-Day Instruction System

[Report from Our Newspaper in Qingdao] The original Dengzhou Road school building of Qingdao Municipal High School was used as barracks by the Japanese army during the Anti-Japanese War, and it was moved to Guizhou Road. Currently, the school has ten classes in the senior high school and twenty-four classes in the junior high school, for a total of thirty-four classes. The Guizhou Road school building has only fifteen classrooms, so teaching has always been carried out in a two-part system. The city's education authorities, fearing that the two-part teaching system would affect academic prospects, tried hard to change the two-part system to a full-day instruction system. Therefore, it has specially sought another school building for the ten classes of senior high school students to attend classes, so that the school building on Guizhou Road can be vacated for the use of the fifteen classes of junior high school students. The remaining nine classes will be transferred to CangKou Middle School and Rural Simple Normal School, with seven classes going to CangKou Middle School and two classes going to Rural Simple Normal School.

### Relief for Out-of-School Children in Hubei: Temporary Implementation of Half-Day, Two-Session System

Mayor Xu's Statement

[New China News Agency, Hankou] Mayor Xu of Hankou, in order to alleviate the problem of primary school students in Hankou being out of school, recently issued the following statement: "Recently, the enrollment of students in various primary schools has felt crowded. The issue of school-age children being out of school has become a serious problem. The city government has been paying attention to this since receiving Hankou last year. After overcoming some difficulties, we managed to maintain the existing twenty-seven school buildings. Since January of this year, children who have come to Hankou from the rear have been accommodated by increasing classes and expanding enrollment in various schools. Currently, the capacity of each school building is full, and it is impossible to find new school buildings or add new schools. Therefore, children who have recently arrived in Hankou deeply feel the lack of places to study. As a last resort, we can only convert all school halls, libraries, and usable parts into classrooms, adding a total of sixty-one classes. Currently, funding and personnel are not a problem. As long as there are school buildings, the city government is still willing to continue to establish schools. In order to alleviate the current serious situation, we have ordered all schools to temporarily implement a half-day, two-session system, which can increase enrollment by 10,000 students. This is a temporary relief measure of last resort, and we hope that people from all walks of life can provide more assistance in terms of school buildings."

### Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff Demand Improved Treatment, Host Politicians and Reporters

[This city] Municipal primary and secondary schools and social education institutions in this city, because of high prices and difficult living conditions, previously elected representatives to demand improved treatment and increased educational expenses from the municipal authorities. Several petitions and talks have taken place, but there are still some gaps between the two sides. The most important issue is the number of months of emergency salary advances. The teachers and staff advocate that before the central government approves salaries based on the cost of living index, the bureau should approve an advance of 150,000 yuan per person per month, in addition to the original salary, limited to four months, with the funds being deducted from the education loan item. The bureau said that it is difficult to predict how much education loan funds can be raised, and only admits to temporarily approving advances of 50,000 to 80,000 yuan. The primary and secondary school teachers and staff believe that they must continue their efforts to achieve their goals. Yesterday noon, they specially hosted the city's politicians and newspaper reporters at the New Life Club. Politicians such as Tao Baichuan attended. On the newspaper side, representatives from the Central News Agency, New China News Agency, Zhengyan Daily, China-America Daily, and Xinwen Daily attended. On the school side, 83 representatives from primary and secondary schools and social education institutions attended. After Chairman Zhou Jiaoqing announced the opening of the meeting, Zhang Yiyong was elected as the spokesperson for the secondary schools, and Wang Liben was elected as the spokesperson for the primary schools. They reported in detail the purpose of requesting improved treatment and increased funding, as well as the process. Tao Baichuan then expressed his opinions, which were earnest and won applause from the entire audience. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM.

### Another Success for the Occupational Protection Committee

Resolution of the Qian De Teacher Dismissal Issue

[This city] The Jide Primary School, which had a dispute at the same time as the Zhijiang Primary School, unjustly dismissed teacher Jin Sheng. After the Occupational Protection Committee, the Bureau of Education, and the school's board of directors negotiated and mediated for a month and a half, it has now been resolved satisfactorily: (1) The school will issue a letter of appointment; (2) The board of directors will issue another letter of appointment, hiring Jin Sheng to Chongzhen Primary School (also run by the same board of directors), allowing Jin Sheng to choose to teach; (3) For the damage to reputation, the school will send two representatives to publicly apologize to Jin Sheng.

### Basketball League Finals Tonight: Hualian vs. Saco for Supremacy, Starting at 7:45 PM at the Municipal Gymnasium

The final battle between Hualian and Saco in the basketball league is scheduled to take place at 7:45 PM this evening at the Municipal Gymnasium. This battle is tantamount to the final of the Group A division of the league. It is expected that there will be an unprecedented spectacle tonight. All of our basketball fans should arrive early to avoid disappointment.

Hualian has maintained its winning streak in the league, leading the pack. Saco has also repeatedly defeated strong teams, but unfortunately forfeited once. Therefore, Hualian is currently in a more advantageous position. If Hualian loses today, there is still hope for a rematch. If Saco loses today, there is no hope of winning the championship. Both teams have a wealth of experience and can be considered evenly matched. It is not easy to make a pre-match prediction about who will win. However, considering the height of Saco's forwards and their abundant stamina, Hualian should find a way to stop them. Whether Hualian can shoot accurately is also a major key to whether they can win today. The rosters of the two teams are as follows:

[Hualian] Li Zhenzhong, Kong Guangyi, Bao Songyuan, Wu Chengzhang, Chen Xuesong, Zhang Liangxiong

[Saco] Anderson, Liege, Hertolai, Dang Le, Parker, Peterson, Kang Qulang, Gao Futuo.

Yesterday's Results

In yesterday's three matches, Renyu easily defeated Liufenwei by a landslide. The first half was 30 to 9, and the final result was 68 to 21, with Renyu winning. Dexheng and Xingzhong had a rather tense situation. In the latter game, Yan Shixin and Zhou Zhi came to the field to help. The first half was 30 to 26, and the final result was 70 to 60, with Xingzhong triumphing. In the final match, the Shan team defeated the Lan team. The first half was 24 to 20. The Lan team made extraordinary efforts, but the Shan team showed its power in the second half, finally defeating the Lan team 48 to 38.

### Important Basketball Programs Broadcast Starting Next Week

In order to arouse the interest of all circles and facilitate basketball fans who cannot come to the venue, as well as allow basketball fans in other cities to hear the battle situation on the radio, the basketball league office has contacted the Shanghai Radio Station to broadcast live from the venue. It was originally scheduled to start today, but due to the connection relationship of the Telephone Bureau, it will have to wait until next week to install the equipment. Therefore, today's Hualian-Saco battle cannot be broadcast. The league office is very sorry, but it can be implemented from next week. This can be said to be one of the successes of the basketball league work.

### Will a Trojan Horse Government Appear in China? Broadcast Speech by Powell and Emmet at the Sino-American Relations Symposium

Amidst the succession of strikes from various sectors, at least one glimmer of hope shines through these bad tidings, namely, the cessation of China's civil war and the imminent realization of the long-awaited national unity between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

If this is indeed the case, it would be welcome news to the vast majority of the American people. We not only admire the courage and patience displayed by the Chinese people during their long and arduous struggle, but also, most Americans are deeply aware that China has been fighting our common enemy for longer than any other allied nation, while receiving less material assistance from our Lend-Lease Act than any other allied nation.

China's Significant Progress

From 1927 to 1937, China made great strides in these ten years, demonstrating the ability of ancient Chinese culture to adapt to the conditions of a new era. Japan launched its full-scale war of aggression in 1937 precisely because it had long feared this progress. Consequently, various plans, such as national industrialization, opening up transportation for national unity, and promoting education for the implementation of democracy, were all interrupted. A very small amount of industry and transportation lines were also destroyed. Although China trained tens of thousands of adults to read and write during the war, it was still far from the level of intellectual development required for the implementation of democracy.

Since full democracy requires national unity and education as prerequisites, Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China, stipulated that the Kuomintang should implement tutelage until the foundations of democracy were established. However, due to the outbreak of war, the measures for tutelage were delayed.

Avoiding the Threat of Civil War

While the Kuomintang forces suffered fierce attacks from the Japanese army, the Communist Party took the opportunity to consolidate its position. After the peace, it threatened to launch a full-scale civil war. To avoid the realization of this threat, the United States used increasing pressure to promote compromise. This is the purpose of General Marshall's mission today.

It is reported that the negotiations for unity and unification will be successful, but the same rumors have been heard before. And the same, almost insurmountable difficulties, still exist. The key to the success of organizing any coalition government in China is not only whether it can reconcile the differences between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but also whether it can concentrate enough strength to cope with the vast and unpredictable administrative contingencies. The pressing issues that need to be resolved will be discussed below:

Reviewing the Issue of Returning the Capital

The first thing at hand is to move the government from the wartime capital, Chongqing, back to Nanjing. The distance is 1,500 miles, and the only available means of transportation, apart from a limited number of transport aircraft, is by boat down the Yangtze River. At the same time, the return to the capital brings with it a very serious political consideration, namely, the excessive number of people in Chongqing who rely on government subsidies for a living.

Someone once imagined this scenario: Suppose we had to move the capital from Washington to Missouri, and then back to Washington, with the only means of transportation being by boat down the Ohio, and then up the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, what would become of the civil servants in Washington?

Leaving aside purely domestic affairs, including the most serious relief issues, and temporarily setting aside the difficult situation created by the Soviet Union in Manchuria, the serious problems facing China lie in readjusting its relations with foreign countries and considering foreign interests in China, based on the new treaties signed during the war of resistance. It has recently been learned that France, which previously intended to abandon consular jurisdiction, is now unwilling to do so, claiming that the treaty has not yet been signed, while the United States and Britain have already abandoned consular jurisdiction.

Foreign firms intend to reopen under the new circumstances, but according to reports, they are currently finding it quite difficult. China insists that all foreign firms must re-register in accordance with the provisions of Chinese law, and some foreigners say that under these regulations, foreign firms cannot operate.

The above is just a part of the various problems facing the government, but all problems are related to politically explosive issues. One of the sticks used by the Communist Party to attack the government is that the central government is excessively serving as a tool for foreigners, especially for Americans and Britons. At the beginning of the war, the Chinese Red Army attacked the Chongqing government as a puppet government of the United States and Britain.

The matter of seeking unity between the Communist Party and the government in China must be considered in light of the need for a strong government to solve specific construction problems. It is doubtful to what extent Chairman Chiang can give up his control and the control of the party he inherited from Sun Yat-sen without causing even greater disruption to the administrative system than exists today. Because the period of tutelage has not been completed, can the necessary administrative control be safely shared with the CCP? In addition, there is the Democratic League, but this party is a collection of intellectuals, and its organizational strength is very weak. The only parties truly qualified to form a government are the Kuomintang or the Communist Party, or a coalition of the two.

The CCP Joins the Government

The question of whether Chairman Chiang will allow the Communist Party to join the government is the same as the difficult problem that de Gaulle faced in France after the war. The comparison between the two makes it easy to understand. Although France is an advanced democracy and the electorate is highly educated, it suffered greatly before the war because the power of the administrative institutions was too weak, which was one of the reasons why it was defeated by the Nazis. After the war, de Gaulle and his comrades drafted a new constitution under the Fourth Republic, strengthening the power of the administrative institutions so that the democratic government could be stable. In short, the constitution drafted by de Gaulle largely imitated the American presidential system, concentrating power in the hands of the president, and granting the president even greater powers in times of emergency.

Before the new constitution was implemented, de Gaulle was again the president in charge of administration, stipulating some transitional powers. General de Gaulle was willing to allow members of the Communist Party to join his cabinet, and he had already ordered them to join. However, he refused to allow Communist Party members to serve as cabinet members related to foreign policy and national defense, because he could not trust them due to the Communist Party's loyalty to foreign governments. Because of this attitude, de Gaulle was forced to resign by the Communist Party.

Assuming that de Gaulle's position is logical and can gain the support of democrats in France and around the world, will Chairman Chiang's firm attitude towards the Communist Party be more justified? The Chinese Communist Party has an army, while the French Communist Party does not. The distance between the French and Russian borders is hundreds of miles, while the border between China and Russia is longer than the border between any two neighboring countries in the world.

Those who usually defend the Communist Party say that the Chinese Communist Party is not Marxist and has no connection with Moscow. They also say that the Chinese Communist Party members are just simple farmers who are only interested in improving the welfare of farmers. Can we believe this?

Recently, when the Chinese Red Army seized a strategic stronghold – Zhangjiakou – on the border of Inner Mongolia, northwest of Beiping, their actions showed another motive. Mr. Steele has written a brilliant article on this in the *Forward Forum*. The methods used by the Red Army in Zhangjiakou are very similar to the Red Terror that the Communist Party used to use when it participated in the National Revolution in 1927. This Red Terror was ultimately responsible for the break between the Kuomintang and the Russian Trotskyites who led the Chinese Communist Party at that time. The *New York Times* published the following editorial satirizing what the Chinese Communist Party has done in Zhangjiakou recently:

"When the Chinese Communist Party seizes a county seat, the first thing they do is arrest their enemies and shoot them if necessary. The second thing they do is divide the land among the people and announce a 100% increase in wages. The third thing they do is set up a secret police and concentration camps. They only allow the publication of official gazettes and official documents, and prohibit all opposition gatherings. When you read this, don't mistake them for communists. They are simple farmers in China."

"They are not communists but reformers," this statement has been heard often since we came into contact with Chinese society. And have not the Communist Parties in Southern France, Yugoslavia, Mexico, the United States, and Brazil made the same statement? None of today's Communist Parties adhere to the old methods of the past Communist Party. In order to achieve their strategies, they do not hesitate to cooperate with Vargas, the stubborn dictator of Brazil, the stubborn elements of the Democratic Party in New York (Tammary elements), and the former Fascists in Yugoslavia.

Therefore, the examination of a modern Communist Party lies not in its loyalty to Marx, but in its loyalty to Stalin. This is why General de Gaulle refused to give members of the Communist Party important cabinet positions.

Is it in the interest of the United States to force Chairman Chiang to do so?

Lin Yutang's Reply to Snow

In response to Snow's book review of his book "Vigil of a Nation," published in the *National* magazine on March 24, 1945, Lin Yutang made the following summary of the debate published by the Chinese Communist Party:

"If someone thinks that the Chinese Communist Party is similar to Communist Parties in other countries, it is a strange thing. Then the record of the CCP's loyalty to Moscow will certainly make those who think it is strange no longer think it is strange. When Stalin joined hands with Hitler, the CCP strictly maintained an isolated attitude. Mao Zedong (who was an executive member of the CCP from 1935 to 1943) was extremely anti-American and anti-British. I cannot forgive anyone who ignores and reports these facts. Hitler was scolded as a "mad dog" before concluding a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union, was respected as a head of state during the duration of the treaty, and became a despicable animal again after June 22, 1941. I can list more than a dozen editorials and their dates from Chongqing's *Xinhua Daily*. What is the content of "Not Participating in the European War" on May 21, 1941? It is also strange that this article was published only 40 days before June 22. What is the content of "A Dead End" on April 25, 1940? This article is calling for participation in the European War. Mao Zedong demanded absolute neutrality and accused Roosevelt's Lend-Lease Act to Britain of being false neutrality, attempting to drag the United States into the Second Imperialist War. The Communist Party allowed Stalin to recognize the Japanese "Manchukuo" border. Mao Zedong called the British and American imperialists "sons of bitches," and scolded the Japanese imperialists in the same tone on page 45 of *On New Democracy*. Mao hated anyone who said that the British and Americans were different from the Japanese imperialists."

Recently, Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese Red Army, wrote a small book entitled "On New Democracy." The popular edition published in New York had a preface by Browder, a Communist leader in the United States who had been expelled. This book is the latest statement of the Chinese Communist Party, encouraging all loyal Communists to work hard to study it, regardless of their nationality. The main points of the book are widely quoted by spokespersons and speakers of the Chinese Red Army in the United States. In short, the purpose of Mao's book is to explain the Red Army leaders' views on negotiation and the principles of democracy and communism.

Recently, from research materials collected by Americans (one of whom is a Catholic priest), I obtained a propaganda booklet. This book will amaze anyone familiar with Communist propaganda tactics. The original Chinese version sold in the United States is slightly different from the version sold in China in terms of materials.

### Sino-American Friendship

Time does not allow for a detailed review of the above two books, but when Mao Zedong denounces democratic countries, including China, the United States, and Britain, as bourgeois bloody military dictatorships, he often mentions the word Original.

Regarding Sino-American friendship, Mao said that China will be in a puppet position, just like the Wang Jingwei Nanjing puppet regime, naturally excluding the Soviet Union. Mao expressed extreme hatred for democratic countries throughout the book, saying that China's joining the democratic alliance has already fallen into a trap. He said that cooperating with democratic countries during the war is no more possible than "serving God and serving wealth."

The main point of this book is to answer the question of "Is the Chinese Communist Party a true Communist Party?" Mao's answer is that they are a true Communist Party, and their hatred of the American democratic system and its effects is unquestionable.

We already know that although de Gaulle won the support of a majority of the French people in the last election – I believe that Chairman Chiang can also win the support of a majority of the people – it is still useless. De Gaulle believed that unless the French Parliament authorized him to exercise great power and clearly stipulated this in the new constitution, he would not be able to rely on the support of the majority of the people to oppose the well-organized minority Communist Party that has foreign assistance, in order to continue to rule France.

From the above, it can be seen that if we force Chairman Chiang to give the CCP a portion of political power, it will be enough to force China into the Soviet sphere of influence and never return. Sino-American friendship and the Open Door Policy that we have always advocated will be sacrificed because of this.

The CCP's view of us has been expressed not only in words and print, but also in military actions in the North China American military zone. The Chinese Communist Party does not want our help in Asia; they only need Soviet cooperation. Therefore, some students demand that the U.S. military withdraw from China and send the U.S. military back home. The intention is here. Today, we are once again encountering the resurgence of the Communist isolationist alliance, which did its best to prevent American aid to China and Britain during the period when Hitler and Stalin joined hands.

U.S. troops stationed in China have been ambushed by the Communist army, U.S. pilots have been shot at by the Red Army, and U.S. pilots have been detained in the Red Army area. All of this is more important than anything else. The fact that the American army and navy were shot at by hostile Chinese troops is the first time since the Boxer Rebellion half a century ago. When we want to force the Chinese Nationalist government, which fought with us and for us during the war, to accommodate the Communist Party, we must seriously consider such incidents.

A better policy (and it is not too late to implement this policy) is to force the Communist Party to make concessions, rather than forcing Chairman Chiang. If we support the basic authority that Chairman Chiang needs and his legitimate government, we will have more power to promote the reform of the Kuomintang's internal political organization – this party now contains corrupt and stubborn elements. The more the Communist Party's power in China is strengthened, the more Chairman Chiang and anti-Communist liberals will rely on stubborn elements to prevent the Communist Party from usurping power. Most Chinese people, like other nations, would rather have stubborn or corrupt politics exist than have a "Trojan Horse Government" (i.e., a Chinese puppet government under the command of foreign dictators) appear.

### Random Notes from an Inspection with Marshal Marshall (3)

Mao's Wife: The Flower of Yan'an

(Dispatch from this newspaper, dated the 12th)

Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, is a flower of Yan'an. The wind and sand of the border region have not broken her charm in the past eight years. She is still beautiful and moving, wearing a tightly buttoned pine-yellow army呢 (n呢, a type of wool fabric) overcoat. Inside is a brand new gray wool suit, as if it had just been ironed. The wool vest showing at her chest seems to be covered with a layer of snow. She told us that she returned to Yan'an from Chongqing with Zhou Enlai on the 19th of last month, two days later than what was reported in the newspapers. "Chongqing has one drawback," she said, slightly lifting her head and gesturing with her right hand, "there is too little sunlight!" "So is the climate in Yan'an good?" "It's okay. The climate here is relatively dry – but I grew up in a marine climate," "So do you hope to return to Shanghai?" She was a little embarrassed, "I hope so." A friend jokingly said, "You should persuade Mr. Mao to go to Nanjing, and then you can return to Shanghai." She smiled shyly. "If there is a chance, would you be willing to appear on stage or on the silver screen again?" She considered for a moment and said, "Whatever work our organization wants me to do, I will do." She looked at the reporter's business card, which represented *Shen Bao*, and asked, "Does *Shen Bao* still publish a large stack of newspapers every day?" As she spoke, she used her thumb and index finger to gesture the thickness and number of pages of *Shen Bao*. "*Shen Bao*'s..."

### Sister Cai Chats About the Women's Movement

The famous "Sister Cai" (named Cai Chang, wife of Li Fuchun) in Yan'an was at our table during dinner. She is a leader in the women's movement in Yan'an and was elected as a member of the CCP Central Committee at the National Congress last year. She said that the focus of the CCP's current women's movement work is to guide rural women to work hard in agricultural production, to let them know midwifery and infant care knowledge (especially to pay attention to the improvement of midwifery, because the population mortality rate in the border area, especially the infant and women's mortality rate, is very high), to help stabilize families, and not to encourage divorce. The reporter asked, "Isn't this reverting to the doctrine of a good wife and a wise mother?" Her answer was, "That depends on what kind of meaning it is under." Clearly, the CCP's rule in the poor rural areas also needs tens of thousands of "farm women" of the good wife and wise mother type to be its pillars.

After the Japanese surrendered, the intellectuals in Yan'an flocked east to Zhangjiakou. Almost all of them left, except for a few people like Ai Siqi, Chen Boda, and Zhang Zhongshi to look after the house. From Ai Siqi's civil servant-like face and cotton army uniform, you couldn't tell that he was a philosopher. In these years, he didn't publish any large books, but only worked hard to prepare some policies and outlines suitable for the CCP's needs in a national form and instill them into the farmers, soldiers, and masses. Chen Boda wore a white towel around his neck instead of a scarf. Zhang Zhongshi was also wearing a cotton army uniform. He said that since coming to the border area, he has been able to concentrate on writing and research without worrying about living problems, because everything he needs is issued to him.

### Secretary Luo Talks a Lot About the Political Situation

Let me write a little about the political situation in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Luo Mai, Secretary-General of the Border Region Government, said that the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region covers an area of 90,000 square kilometers and is currently divided into 29 counties and one city with a population of 1.5 million, an army of 30,000, and an administrative staff of between 15,000 and 18,000. The total grain production in the region is 1.6 million shi (石, a unit of dry measure) per year, and the people's burden of public grain is less than 10% – the earliest national salvation public grain was 200,000 shi per year, but later, due to the self-sufficiency movement of military and political personnel, it was reduced to 180,000 shi in the 32nd year, 160,000 shi in the 33rd year, and 120,000 shi last year. The past salt-grain public money (in the past, people had to transport salt for the government, and they could not transport salt produced by the government, so they paid salt-grain public money) has been exempted this year. The people's burden has been gradually reduced. In terms of agriculture, all that has been achieved in these years is to organize the labor conditions in the countryside (plowing cattle, labor, farming tools, seeds) to prevent waste. In terms of industry, the government has tried its best to promote cotton planting and spinning, planting 300,000 mu (畝, a unit of land measure) of cotton, and harvesting more than 200,000 dan (担, a unit of weight measure) of cotton. In two or three years, the border region is expected to be self-sufficient in cotton. He also said that the currency inflation in the border region has reached an alarming level. At present, the value of one *shi* of millet in the border region is 400,000 border dollars. A middle school teacher earns about 1.2 *shi* to 1.5 *shi* of grain per month, which translates to 480,000 to 600,000 border dollars. This is even more alarming than the amount of legal currency salary received by government employees in the rear. This kind of rapid inflation made them feel that the printing of border dollars was not enough, so they imitated the customs gold (關金) method and issued another kind of circulating note similar to customs gold through trading companies. One yuan of circulating note is equal to 20 yuan of border dollars (issued by the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Bank). Currently, the denominations of the circulating notes are 10 yuan, 100 yuan, 200 yuan, 250 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and even 2,000 yuan. (The ratio of legal currency to border dollars is currently one to ten, and the ratio to circulating notes is 0.5 to one yuan. You do the math!) The degree of currency inflation is actually even greater than that of legal currency. The border region government is quite troubled by this problem. Secretary-General Luo sincerely said, "We are really unable to recover so many border dollars circulating notes. We hope that the central government will protect the law and recover them in the future."

Now that there is peace, where will Yan'an go? The *Times* reported that Mao Zedong has already been looking for a house in Nanjing. Some people say that Chongqing + Yan'an = Nanjing. It seems that the formula can also be corrected to Chongqing + Yan'an + Washington = Nanjing.

The mysterious color of Yan'an will be diluted in the torrent of peace. Maybe there will be no more journalists going to Yan'an tomorrow.

Therefore, some Communist Party members have suggested building a historical museum in Yan'an. (March 11, in Beiping)

### Reader Opinions: Preferential Treatment Should Be Given in Handling Pre-War Public Bonds

To the Editor:

The methods a nation uses to remedy financial difficulties are none other than increasing taxes, printing more money, and issuing public bonds. Increasing taxes is too slow timewise. Printing more money easily leads to inflation. Issuing public bonds can contract the currency, absorb idle funds, and provide investment avenues for the people. Therefore, issuing public bonds is a good way to relieve financial difficulties.

Our country issued five types of unified public bonds in the 25th year of the Republic [1936]. The total amount was 750 million yuan. Ten years have passed, and the currency has inflated due to the war. If the government still repays the principal and interest at the original amount, it would be tantamount to the nation defaulting on its debt to the people. However, there are many historical precedents of nations defaulting on foreign debt, but there has never been a case of defaulting on domestic public bonds. Even Germany, after the First World War, although a defeated nation, had preferential treatment measures when reorganizing its currency system to pay for public bonds. Now that our country is a victorious nation, is there any reason not to provide preferential treatment for public bonds when reorganizing the currency system after the war? The people are the foundation of the nation. If the nation loses the people's trust, it will be difficult to issue public bonds in the event of future financial difficulties.

The authorities issuing the Sun Yat-sen banknotes have repeatedly stated that all rumors are untrue. However, reorganizing the currency system is a step that the nation must take to seek progress after inflation. President Song [Ziwen] also stated in his political report that "the currency system can only be reorganized after prices stabilize." Therefore, cracking down on speculation is one thing, and handling public bonds is another; the two should not be confused. I hope the wise authorities will quickly devise appropriate measures to handle pre-war public bonds and prevent the people of the whole country from losing their patriotic faith again. It should be known that many people invested in public bonds before the war as savings and pensions. Not only have they not received a single cent of interest during this period of resistance against Japan, but now, after the victory, they are still receiving devalued legal tender, which is surely a serious blow to those who enthusiastically invested in the nation.

### How Foolish are Strikes and Work Slowdowns

Opening the newspapers of the past few months, news of work slowdowns and strikes is almost a daily occurrence. Employees take this action out of desperation for a living, which is understandable, but the result is still a losing proposition. Because in the past, during the national crisis, capitalists took advantage of traffic jams and shortages of materials to speculate and hoard, manipulating the market. Their profits were calculated in multiples. Now, although victory has been achieved, their mindset of getting rich has not changed. Our employees' demands for improved treatment are like digging into their flesh, which they are unwilling to grant readily. Even if they allow it, the money will come out of the consumers’ pockets, raising prices and increasing interest rates; even their markups exceed what they pay out. They say to the outside world: "In order to maintain the livelihood of employees, we have no choice but to increase prices." We employees, however, have only had our wages increased by a small amount, while all prices have increased several times. Expenses are even higher, and we still cannot make ends meet. Therefore, striking for a living—raising prices to adjust treatment—striking because of high prices and insecure livelihoods—in this way, the matter of strikes and work slowdowns becomes a cyclical ailment, one rising as the other falls, and it is not easy to solve at once.

In my humble opinion, during this transitional period, we must understand the position of each individual, we must be able to endure hardship, we do not need to harbor any extravagant hopes, and we do not need to look up and request that the capitalists improve our treatment. We can monitor the capitalists in our respective positions, not allowing them to increase prices on any pretext, and not allowing them to obtain excessive profits. For example, in factories, we can calculate the cost of raw material purchase prices, manufacturing costs, and all expenses to determine its cost, plus a legal profit, which can be used as the wholesale price, requesting that the factory not sell it above this value. In stores, companies, and banks, this method can also be used. In addition to legal profits, they must not raise selling prices or charge illegal high interest rates. If the capitalists cannot accept our request, we can expose the facts and let society punish them. I believe that with this method, as long as the employees of several large factories, large stores, large companies, and large banks implement it consistently, not fearing threats and not being tempted by benefits, city-wide prices may generally fall in the short term. We are performing this work for the sake of social stability and the livelihood of the masses, and the people will surely express their sympathy for us.

Publishing Circle

### China Should Join the International Copyright Convention

— Yuan Da

Now that China has won the war and become one of the five great powers, we really should catch up quickly in many ways to adapt to this newly acquired honor and status, so as to avoid remaining in a backward and lagging position.

One of these things that has a direct relationship with Chinese writers and the publishing industry is that China should quickly join the International Copyright Convention. This is related to the interests of writers and publishers, and to the status and reputation of the entire nation.

Recently, Mr. Shu Sheyu (Lao She), a Chinese writer who was invited by the US government to lecture abroad, had a novel called "Rickshaw Boy" translated into English, published in the US, and became a bestseller. This can be said to be a very glorious thing for China and for Mr. Lao She personally. Mr. Lao She's life has been spent in hardship for decades, even to the point of suffering from anemia and malnutrition. This may not matter to the steadfast and outstanding Mr. Lao She, but his relatives and readers who love literature really cannot stand it. Before his trip abroad, I talked to him about the royalty issue of the translated version of "Rickshaw Boy." He said that he had no say in the matter because China has not joined the International Copyright Convention at all. Therefore, in law, we have no standing to ask for royalties from others. Therefore, how much royalty the original author should get can only depend on what the translator gives. And now, Mr. Lao She's family relies on a limited sum of royalties given by that translator as part of their living expenses.

The reason why China should join the International Copyright Convention is not only to ensure that the copyrights of our country's writers are protected so that they can obtain the royalties they deserve; more importantly, it is to enable China and Chinese writers, translators, and publishers to stand properly in the international community and receive international attention and reputation.

We hope that people in China's cultural and publishing circles will pay attention to this issue.

### On Democratic Constitutionalism

— Ping Fan

Author: Chen Qitian

Publisher: Commercial Press

Date: Chongqing, 1944

Shanghai Revised Edition, October 1945

Pages: 219

Democratic politics is the main trend of modern world culture, and this trend is surging in China. Unfortunately, most people only use the word "democracy" as a slogan for political activities, and it is truly not a blessing for the nation if they do not have a clear understanding of the true meaning of democracy. Those who lead youth activities and the youths who like to engage in political and social activities still need to have a correct understanding of this aspect. The way to understand this is to study more books of this kind, rather than spending all of one's energy on a certain political ideology or blindly following a few people. I am introducing this book to truly do something for the youth of China in this area.

The book is divided into thirteen chapters. Each chapter was originally published separately, so it seems to lack systematism. However, the theory is consistent, and the style is the same. Chapter Seven explains the development of China's efforts in the constitutional movement in the past fifty years. Chapter One discusses the relationship between democratic constitutionalism and political construction. Mr. Chen believes that politics is the general pivot of the overall national situation, and democratic constitutionalism is the general policy of China's political construction. He said in the preface to the first edition: "To demand the success of nation-building, democratic constitutionalism must be implemented; to demand that everyone can be a human being, democratic constitutionalism must be implemented; to demand that everyone can save the country, democratic constitutionalism must be implemented." Chapter Two is about the implementation of democratic constitutionalism. The main question is whether it should be implemented during the war, which is no longer a question, so there is no need to introduce it further.

Chapter Three explains the principles of democratic constitutionalism: (1) New politics is public-spirited politics rather than private politics. Public-spirited people refer to those who are talented and can handle public affairs impartially, regardless of their personal relationships or their advancement and retreat based on personal relationships. (2) New politics is public law politics rather than private law politics; it uses "the law of the world" rather than "the law of the family." (3) New politics is public interest politics rather than private interest politics. (4) It is politics of principle rather than politics of power. (5) It is government by the people rather than government by officials. (6) It is practical politics rather than hypocritical politics.

Chapter Four discusses what the demeanor of people in democratic constitutionalism should be. The author believes that a true politician engaged in democratic constitutionalism must abide by eight tenets: (1) One should not use foreign aid as a background. "Purely foreign parties must absolutely not engage in political activities in this country. Even parties in this country should not borrow foreign aid to engage in internal strife... Moreover, if a party uses foreign aid as a background, it will inevitably cause the country to fall into division, becoming a one-party country, with each side fighting to the death, and how can we talk about democratic constitutionalism?" (2) One should not use force as a backing. In a truly democratic constitutionalist country, all military forces must be national defense forces, only for external purposes, not internal purposes. (3) One should not use conspiracy as a means. All those engaged in political activities should treat each other with an open attitude. (4) One should not take monopoly as an objective. Any party, although its methods may be different, its ultimate goal should be the happiness of the people of this country. "Factional politics is already unacceptable, and monopoly politics is even more unacceptable." (5) All political actors must respect public opinion. People must be allowed freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association regarding politics. (6) One must respect justice. "Allowing oneself to be involved in politics but not allowing others to be involved in politics is inequality and injustice." Therefore, all political actors should have both the spirit of fair competition and mutual tolerance. (7) All political activities must respect laws and disciplines. Laws and disciplines are the public track of democratic constitutionalism. Everyone has freedom within the laws and disciplines. Everyone must be equal before the laws and disciplines, and there should be no privileged classes. Orders must not change laws, and laws must not change the constitution. (8) One must respect responsibility. Therefore, under democratic constitutionalism, there must be statutory public opinion organs to hold administrative organs accountable. Administrative organs must respect public opinion organs in order to respect responsibility.

In Chapter Five, the author states the differences between democratic and non-democratic politics. He says that, firstly, democratic politics must have a government commonly owned by all the people; secondly, since democratic politics only needs a government owned by the people, the government must be governed by the people to establish a government of the people; thirdly, in democratic politics, there is no distinction between the ruling class and the ruled class, and it becomes a government enjoyed by the people; fourthly, under democratic politics, since the government is owned, governed, and enjoyed by the people, the people easily merge with the government into one. From these characteristics, we discover that democratic politics is more rational, harmonious, and stable than all non-democratic politics, and it is indeed a long-term and stable political system.

Chapter Six discusses the philosophical background of democratic politics. Here, the author again discusses it from two aspects. On one hand, he talks about the political philosophy of democratic politics, and on the other hand, he talks about the philosophy of life of democratic politics. In political philosophy, he explains several basic theories: (1) The state and the government should be strictly separated; (2) It should be that people rule themselves, so that ruling and being ruled are intertwined; (3) People should have rights and freedoms, which belong to the whole; (4) The rule of law and the rule of man are combined into one; (5) In democratic politics, on the one hand, an order must be established, and on the other hand, it must be constantly reformed to promote progress. As for the philosophy of life of democratic politics, it should contain three major meanings: (1) Group and self are mutually inclusive; (2) Self and others are one; (3) Morality and intelligence are cultivated together. A democratic personality should have five elements: (1) Independent spirit, (2) Cooperative spirit, (3) Fighting spirit, (4) Upright spirit, (5) Practical spirit.

Chapter Nine explains how to complete a democratic political structure. Here, the author says, (1) Public affairs and private affairs should be clearly distinguished. (2) Government and parties should be distinct. In a multi-party system, government officials should advance and retreat with the parties to clarify political responsibility, which is permissible, even necessary. However, civil servants should be non-partisan. (3) Public opinion and official opinion are different. The way to distinguish between public opinion and official opinion is to allow and respect the opposition party's criticism and supervision in parliament. (4) Politics should be distinct from military affairs. If someone uses secret means and violent means to solve political problems, then political disputes become civil wars, which are not enough to be called politics. (5) The judiciary should be separated from the administration. This requires abolishing the tradition of not separating judicial administration, not abusing military law, not allowing party activities to invade the courts, and not arbitrarily arresting, detaining, and punishing the secret organs of the people.

Afterwards, when the author discusses the success or failure of politics, he believes that (1) Politics that is open-minded and progresses with the times is easy to succeed. (2) Politics that takes the world as its own is easy to succeed; otherwise, it will surely fail. (3) Politics that allows public opinion and criticism and supervision from the opposition is easy to succeed; otherwise, it will surely fail. (4) Politics in which the law has authority is easy to succeed. (5) Politics that makes good use of power is easy to succeed; politics that abuses power will surely fail.

Democracy is not only a new politics but also a new life; not only a new system but also a new demeanor; not only a new knowledge but also a new habit. Therefore, we not only focus on new politics, new systems, and new knowledge, but we also need to pay more attention to new life, new demeanor, and new habits. This requires us to learn everything. As for the method of learning, we should pay attention to two points: (1) We must learn democracy in the struggle for democracy; (2) We must learn democracy in the practice of democracy.

Chapter Eight introduces Russell's recent book "Power," and also discusses democratic politics and Chinese politics, which should be listed in the appendix. Other chapters with many repetitions are omitted. To get a glimpse of the whole picture, please read the original book.

### Reading "Secondary School Guidance"

— Wu Zijia

Recently, I spent several evenings reading Mr. Yang Tongfang's "Secondary School Guidance," and I feel that it does have unique insights. The book is published by World Book Company and listed as a New Education Series. It has been published for three years, but it was sealed up by the enemy and puppets at the time, and only after the victory was it unsealed and sold.

Speaking of educational reform, many people advocate starting with secondary school education, because the objects of education during this period are young people whose bodies and minds are developing rapidly. They need basic knowledge and a rich life. The former belongs to the infusion of knowledge and ability, and the latter is the cultivation of moral education. It can be seen that in secondary schools, "teaching" and "guidance" should be equally emphasized. The failure of our country's secondary school education is largely due to the separation of "teaching" and "guidance" (of course, unifying "teaching" and "guidance" is not something that can be achieved simply by merging the "teaching affairs office" and the "guidance office" into a "teaching and guidance office.) and the poor traditional guidance methods.

This book emphasizes the relationship between "teaching" and "guidance," and provides methods for improving secondary school guidance in response to national weaknesses and social needs, so that we can recognize the goals of guidance and the steps of implementation. The author has a good understanding of education and is able to discard those mechanical and rigid principles, use correct theories as the basis, and express his opinions on improving guidance. Although the book is divided into many chapters, it still allows us to find a central idea: Guidance is the whole of life; it is not only passive management, but must enlighten students' moral ideals and seek the cultivation of sound personality. The process of guidance should be from external, prescriptive, to internal, self-disciplined. Unless guidance is infused into the entire life of students, it will not receive true effect.

The scope of secondary school guidance is very large, and the subjects involved include education, psychology, ethics, society, philosophy, and other fields. All factors that can affect students' behavior must be taken into account. In the past, there were no such systematic monographs published, and those published in Britain and the United States were not entirely suitable for national conditions. Therefore, this work that studies the principles and implementation of secondary school guidance is very much needed today. There are elaborations on the physiological and psychological state of secondary school students, social and ethical factors, and the philosophical foundation of secondary school guidance. There is also detailed discussion of the relationship between secondary school guidance and teaching, the moral effects of various subjects, extracurricular activities, and student autonomy, and many practical materials are cited. The issue of youth training is given a special chapter, which describes the current situation of youth training in various countries and the path that China's youth training should take in the future. Sex education occupies a very important position in secondary school guidance, and it is also clearly described, with emphasis on implementation methods, which can break the traditional thinking of general secondary school teachers. The book speaks very thoroughly about the defects of our country's secondary school guidance, and also compares the advantages and disadvantages of various existing guidance systems, pointing out how to determine the goals and methods of guidance in the future.

I feel that the greatest advantage of this book is that it permeates the knowledge of emerging mental hygiene and explains how to apply the principles of mental hygiene to the implementation of guidance. On this point, not only is there a lot of description in Chapter Three, but also the principles of mental hygiene can be fully applied in other chapters, and the materials can be called novel. Although, as the author said, this book can be used as a textbook, I think that it does not have the dryness of a general "textbook," and people who study youth issues should also take a look at it.

Today's China has already stepped onto the stage of nation-building, and we must first cultivate those young people who will shoulder the important task of nation-building in the future, especially those secondary school students who are between elementary school and university, so that they can all become vanguards of nation-building with sound personalities, noble ideals, and a willingness to advance and sacrifice. Those who are responsible for guiding young people! How should they follow young people's psychology, understand national needs, and use positive and rational guidance methods to guide these fresh cells of the nation—the youth—so that they become citizens with sound bodies and minds, which is the greatest need at present. After reading "Secondary School Guidance," I thought of these issues.

### Diplomatic History of the Republic of China (1)

— Mei Ru'ao

Written by Zhang Zhongfu, published by Zhengzhong Book Company, textbook for universities

Shanghai First Edition, November 1945, 25mo, 430 pages

The author of this article, Mr. Mei Ru'ao, is a legal authority in our country, and has served as a professor at the Central Political Academy and Central University, and a member of the Legislative Yuan of the Legislative Yuan. Recently, General MacArthur established the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo to try war criminals, and Mr. Mei was honorably appointed as the chief judge of our country. He recently came to Shanghai on his way to Japan, and in the midst of his busy schedule, he wrote this to grace our publication, for which we are sincerely grateful.

Until now, I have only discovered a relatively good diplomatic history of China, which is Mr. Zhang Zhongfu's Diplomatic History of the Republic of China. Mr. Zhang has served as a professor at Nankai University and the head of the Department of Political Science at National Peking University for many years. Recently, he served as a counselor of the Military Affairs Commission and the director of the American Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. His knowledge and experience are both first-rate. His book "The Anglo-Japanese Alliance" has long been widely known and praised for a time. It is an indispensable reference work for those who study diplomacy in the West. This book is the crystallization of Mr. Zhang's years of research and teaching experience. It goes without saying that it is a valuable work. Unfortunately, only the first volume has been published now, and the publication of the second volume is still awaited. According to the author in the preface: "The discussion only covers the period from 1911 (the Xinhai Revolution) to 1921 (the Washington Conference)." This short decade is China's "eventful autumn." The author uses the domestic politics, international situation, historical origins, public opinion, and personalities of this period as a background, using the most reliable and scientific "historical observation" to objectively and correctly depict the ups and downs of Chinese diplomacy, deeply and simply, and attract people to win. The book draws on a wide range of materials. For example, the issue of recognition by various countries and the issue of participating in the war have been said by predecessors who have not been said; the broad references are all based on reliable history. As for the rigor of the writing and the clarity of the footnotes, they are especially superfluous. If Mr. Jiang Tingfu is said to be the authority on the study of diplomacy in the Qing Dynasty, then Mr. Zhang Zhongfu should be the authority on the study of diplomatic history since the Republic of China. The publication of Mr. Zhang's book is indeed a deeply gratifying event for the academic community and the publishing community during the war in our country. I think that anyone who studies diplomatic history or international politics will have the same feeling after reading this book.

### Textbook Panic?

— Our Reporter

Recently, many primary and secondary school students have said that they have searched all the bookstores but cannot buy textbooks. If they buy Chinese, they lack history; if they have arithmetic, they do not have geography. In order to understand the reasons for this, I visited seven bookstores, including Commercial Press, China, World, Zhengzhong, Datong, Kaiming, and Independent, in two days, which are the so-called "Seven Joint Supply Offices."

As the recovered areas gradually expand, the demand for textbooks is naturally increasing. The "Seven Joint Offices," the agency responsible for supplying textbooks for primary and secondary schools nationwide, has established an organization in Shanghai to supply the needs of the three provinces and two cities in the southeast. Later, Qingdao, Weifeng, and other places also came to Shanghai to purchase books, and for a time, it felt inadequate. However, summarizing the opinions of various companies, they all agreed that the panic situation was not very serious. Because this situation is only individual, not universal. It is possible that a few types or a few volumes are missing, or one company is missing, but another company has more. They believe that as long as they can be fully allocated newsprint, this situation will not occur in the next semester.

Now, under the guidance of the Bureau of Education, schools that cannot buy books can register with the Bureau of Education. The deadline is March 15, and distribution will begin on March 16. However, only 20 schools have registered, and the number is less than 10,000 books, which shows that the panic situation has passed.

It is hoped that the authorities will have thorough statistics and plans in the next semester, so that the textbook shortage panic will not recur this time.

### Books

Bad books are like poisonous drinks; they can affect a person's body and spirit. — Edward

Good books are the guardians that protect humanity from doing bad things. The greatest danger in life is emptiness, which is like an empty house that can be invaded by bad things. If a person reads books, then their mind will never be empty. — Gelaotu (Likely a transliteration of a Western name)

The most beneficial books for us are not those that are most widely introduced, but rather those that are most suitable to our needs and that can quench our intellectual thirst. — Gan Ning

We should use books, not be used by them. We read books to understand life, not read books for the sake of life. — Bai Erfo (Likely a transliteration of a Western name)
