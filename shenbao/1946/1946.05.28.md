### Shenyang Circles Joint Commemoration Week, Chairman Chiang Personally Delivers Admonitory Address, Instructs on Three Principles for the Revival of the Northeast

[Our newspaper Shenyang 27th dispatch] It has been raining in Shenyang recently, then it clears up, and after the clearing, there is wind and sand. The streets of the city are exceptionally clean, as if they have been specially cleaned for the head of state. The head of state holds meetings, gives admonitory speeches, inspects, and receives guests in Shenyang every day, and has almost no free time. On the 26th, he gathered military officers for a roll call and admonitory speech, which lasted for two and a half hours. On the morning of the 27th, at the expanded commemoration week for all circles, he again gave a very long admonitory speech. People in the Northeast all praise the head of state's spirit and physical strength as extraordinary. In addition to paying attention to women's and children's work, Madame Chiang is quite interested in the local customs and conditions, and does not hesitate to work hard and personally conduct on-the-spot investigations, which is praised by many.

[Central News Agency Shenyang 27th dispatch] After Chairman Chiang arrived in Shenyang, he was extremely concerned about the revival of the Northeast's industries. On the morning of the 27th, he summoned Wang Jiazhen, the chairman of the Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters and the director of the Northeast Production Administration. Wang reported on the establishment and work guidelines of the Northeast Production Administration. Chairman Chiang instructed that the revival of the Northeast's industries is not only the foundation for the revival of the Northeast but also the foundation for the construction and revival of the entire country, and efforts must be made to carry it out. If any difficulties are encountered, they should be reported immediately, and solutions will be sought.

[Another dispatch] The joint commemoration week for all circles in Shenyang was held at 9:30 a.m. on the 27th in the auditorium of the provincial government. More than a thousand representatives from various party, government, and military agencies in the city attended. Chairman Chiang personally presided over the event and delivered an impromptu admonitory speech, saying in brief: I came to the Northeast in the third year of the Republic of China and it has been thirty-two years since then. Coming here again this time, I have many feelings. The Northeast is the lifeline of our country. It has been occupied for fifteen years. Now that our territory has been restored, after we take over, we should wash away the accumulated shame and work hard on construction so as not to let down the martyrs who sacrificed themselves to protect and recover the Northeast. The Northeast is the most industrially developed region in our country, but it is dilapidated after the war. The way to restore it should not rely solely on machinery, but should follow the teachings of the Premier [Sun Yat-sen] that "hands are omnipotent." (1) Use the vast human resources of the Northeast to rebuild. If our civil and military officials can lead by example, the people of the Northeast will be happy to serve. (2) The people of the Northeast have been subjected to long-term oppression by the enemy, so their concept of the nation and the people is particularly strong, and their social organization is tight and their economic foundation is solid. If the government can guide them according to the circumstances, implement the new county system, and promote local autonomy, the Northeast will surely become a practical experimental zone for the Three Principles of the People. (3) The people of the Northeast have two major advantages, namely diligence and thrift. If they can achieve speed and certainty in the future to make up for the shortcomings of slowness and superficiality, then after the transformation of the spiritual aspect, it will surely promote the rapid development of material construction. Finally, Chairman earnestly instructed military and political personnel to cherish the people, and at the same time hoped that the people of the Northeast would contribute money and effort to assist the government in order to seek their own happiness and the stability of the Northeast.

### Chairman and Madame Host a Gathering for All Circles in Shenyang, Encouraging Unity of Purpose to Build the Northeast

[Central News Agency Shenyang 27th dispatch] Chairman Chiang and Madame hosted a tea party for local gentry and people from all walks of life in Shenyang at 4 p.m. on the 27th in the city government auditorium. More than 300 people attended. The auditorium was simply decorated, and those invited to attend enthusiastically participated, considering it an supreme honor. At 3:45, the Chairman and Madame traveled by car from the Executive Headquarters to the city government. The streets were densely packed with citizens, who stood and looked up at the Chairman and Madame. At 4:00 p.m., the Chairman, accompanied by Madame and Deputy Chief of Staff Bai, entered the auditorium amidst thunderous applause, responding with smiles. They then took their seats and invited the guests to partake of tea and refreshments. At 4:20, the Chairman stood up and delivered a sincere speech, moving all who listened. At the end of the speech, the entire audience responded with the warmest applause. Gentry representatives Zhang Ziwen and Sun Zhonghe delivered welcoming speeches. When Zhang described the tragic situation during the enemy puppet era and the kindness of the Chairman and Madame's visit to the Northeast today, he was moved to tears, and the Chairman and Madame were also deeply moved. Chen earnestly requested the Chairman to rescue elementary education in the Northeast and requested that the Chairman approve the renaming of Shenyang as a special municipality. The Chairman listened and nodded frequently. Finally, the Chairman said with a smile that the central government would handle the issues raised by everyone. After the meeting, students from the Siwei Drama Elementary School presented flowers and performed the opera "Killing Yan Liang". The Chairman and Madame greatly appreciated and praised the children's skillful performance. Starting at 5:00 p.m., the area outside the city government was crowded with people. When the Chairman and Madame left the city government by car, the citizens cheered thunderously. The Chairman's speech briefly stated: Ladies and gentlemen, compatriots from all walks of life, it is indeed a rare opportunity for my wife and I to meet with you in Shenyang today. Recalling the fall of Shenyang on September 18, 1931, fifteen years ago, the central government was unable to provide timely assistance because it was unprepared, causing our compatriots in the Northeast to suffer oppression from the enemy puppets and live a long life of pain in deep waters. Today, gathering together, reflecting on the pain, I still feel very regretful. Now that the Northeast has been liberated and our compatriots in the Northeast have returned to the embrace of the motherland, when I meet with you today, I have a simple hope, that is, I hope that our compatriots in the Northeast will remember the pain of past invasions and oppression by foreign races and the difficulty of obtaining our freedom and independence, and from now on, we will be united, work together with one heart and one mind, strive diligently, and bury ourselves in hard work to build our Northeast, as our responsibility to build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People, and it is also the earnest expectation of compatriots across the country for you.

### Gu Weijun in Beiping Says Britain Will Return Hong Kong and Kowloon

[Our newspaper Beiping 27th dispatch] Ambassador Gu is currently a distinguished guest in the ancient capital, and has been busy in recent days socializing with friends from military and political circles.

Tomorrow, Cai Wenzhi, the Chief of Staff of the Executive Headquarters, will hold a cocktail party at the Beijing Hotel from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. to publicly introduce Mr. Gu to various circles. Mr. Gu told reporters here that he reiterated that Britain should return Kowloon and Hong Kong, and it will only be a matter of time, and it will not be too long, because Britain's foreign policy after the war, especially its colonial policy, has greatly changed. For example, India and Ceylon have been granted a high degree of autonomy, even independence. Britain's attitude towards Kowloon and Hong Kong will not be an exception, and British public opinion generally advocates that the Hong Kong and Kowloon issue should be resolved as soon as possible, because Britain is facing many difficulties both internally and externally, and has no time to take care of Hong Kong and Kowloon.

### National Army Consolidates the Periphery of Changchun, Progressing Smoothly Towards the Northwest

[Our newspaper Beiping 27th dispatch] A certain military expert said: The current activities of the National Army advancing beyond Changchun are only to consolidate the periphery of Changchun. The rumors that they are heading straight for Harbin are still premature. Last night, the advance report received here stated that the National Army is advancing towards Yongji from two routes, one route pointing west from Changchun, and the other route pointing north from Hailong. Yongji and Changchun are only a short distance apart. If Yongji is captured, the threat to the east side of Changchun can be eliminated. The National Army advancing north along the China Chang Railroad has already advanced into Dehui. After the battle of Sipingjie, the communist troops no longer have any large-scale organized resistance, so the National Army is advancing smoothly. A spokesperson told reporters that the matter of advancing into Harbin is still pending.

[United News Agency Shenyang 27th dispatch] General Du [Yuming] said yesterday: The National Army is continuing to advance north of Changchun and has reached Jiutai, 50 kilometers northeast of Changchun, and Wanbaoshan, 30 kilometers northwest. The progress of the National Army along the Shenyang-Harbin line is still unknown. Anshan is the center of the steel manufacturing industry, 80 kilometers south of Shenyang. It was recovered by the National Army in April. The current situation is quite chaotic. 5,000 communist troops attacked from the east, and a portion of them entered the city on the 25th of this month. Railway traffic between Shenyang and Yingkou has been suspended since the 26th.

[Associated Press Beiping 27th dispatch] Today, a telegram from the war zone command stated that the National Army under General Du Yuming occupied Dehui, 50 li northeast of Changchun, yesterday without firing a single shot, and has now advanced to within 94 li of Harbin. The communist army under General Lin Biao is avoiding contact with the vanguard of the National Army. At the same time, Du Yuming's army launched a surprise attack from the rear of Sipingjie and occupied Hailong, an important stronghold 90 li southwest of Jilin, 90 li east of Sipingjie. Therefore, the pressure on Jilin City has already increased.

[Reuters Nanjing 27th dispatch] According to recent news, the vanguard of the Northeast Central Army is only 25 li away from Harbin and may reach Harbin within 48 hours.

### Xu Yongchang Visits Marshall, Representatives of the Democratic League Staying in Shanghai Will Go to Nanjing Today

[Our newspaper Nanjing 27th dispatch] The Meilun special plane used by the Chairman has flown from Nanjing to Shenyang last week. According to people in the National Government, the Chairman will return to Nanjing soon. After the Chairman arrived in Shenyang, he was concerned day and night about the effect of military mediation in Guannei and the situation of the political consultative talks in Nanjing and Shanghai. It is heard that late at night on the 25th, he drafted and sent detailed telegrams to Nanjing with instructions. It is also heard that in the past three days, Chairman and Marshall have exchanged inquiries and exchanged opinions. It is heard that when Minister Xu Yongchang and his military aide Pi visited Envoy Marshall today, they talked about the Chairman's return date. After the Central Memorial Week was held today, government representatives held a preparatory meeting to promote the talks. The Communist Party representatives seemed to still be obsessed with propaganda, and their efforts to cease fire were clearly "more focused on the verbal arena than the military arena", focusing on propaganda for a ceasefire. According to responsible persons of the Central Propaganda Department, the Communist Party is still insisting on the consensus of the three parties regarding the method of publicizing the ceasefire. In fact, if the military arena cannot stop fighting, everything will be in vain. In terms of the activities of all parties today, it seems that they are still fighting each other. Long Yunji of the Democratic League will come to Nanjing soon. Important figures from various parties staying in Shanghai will also come to Nanjing at the end of the month, but all the decisions on the major premises must wait until the Chairman returns to Nanjing before they can be launched.

[Agence France-Presse Nanjing 27th dispatch] The government representative of the Military Three-Person Team, General Xu Yongchang, Minister of Military Affairs, visited Special Envoy Marshall today. This is Xu's first conversation with Marshall in more than ten days, but Marshall continues to negotiate individually with Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai on the other hand. Today's conversation between Xu and [Marshall] reportedly involved many aspects of the Northeast situation. Xu stated that the government urgently hopes for an improvement in the situation and will do its best to seek an early solution to the problem. The date of the reopening of the Military Three-Person Team meeting has not yet been determined, but people close to the government expect it to be soon.

According to a [unclear] person in the Democratic League, the representatives of the Democratic League have been staying in Shanghai for a long time and feel quite estranged from the political and human situation in the capital. In order to understand the details of the current political discord, it is necessary to go to Nanjing. After arriving in Nanjing, the representatives of the Democratic League will [unclear] stand and express their views on the political situation.

### The War in Shandong Province is Gradually Subsiding, But the Future is Not Entirely Optimistic; Communist Troops are Still Being Transferred Frequently

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 27th Dispatch] Some individuals here have recently taken a newly optimistic view, believing that the defeat of the Communist troops in the Northeast may influence the future of the Shandong situation, leading to a moderation, and that the Communist troops' offensive actions in Shandong Province may cease in time. However, according to the opinion of a certain military observer, the future of the Shandong situation under the Shandong problem is not entirely optimistic.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 26th Dispatch] Although the battles in various parts of Shandong Province have gradually subsided in recent days, the transfer of Communist troops is still extremely frequent. It is reported that more than 30,000 Communist troops south of Tai'an, except for one route left for the local southern regiments, are all moving towards Jinan. It is also reported that the main force of the 9th Liberation Division and the Self-Defense Corps in the Zichuan area are also moving westward.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 26th Dispatch] The general public here has a rather dim impression of the results of the Jinan Group's negotiations with the Communist troops in Linyi yesterday. They believe that the Communist troops' excuse for refusing to return Mingshui, Longshan, and other places clearly shows a lack of sincerity for peace, and the future of the Shandong situation is still difficult to be optimistic about.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 26th Dispatch] It is reported that there are indeed more than one hundred Soviet military officers in Jiaodong, serving to train the Communist troops' artillery. It is also reported that the Jiaodong Communist troops have three regiments equipped by the Soviet Union, but no concrete evidence has been obtained to date.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 26th Dispatch] Military Intelligence: The movements of the Communist troops are recorded as follows: (1) More than 1,000 men from Zhao's unit of the Bohai Military Region, on the evening of the 20th, fled from Huantai to Changshan, preparing to invade Zhangdian. (2) More than 1,000 men from the 25th Regiment of the 4th Liberation Division and local troops, totaling about 3,000, attacked the Southern Dingguo army positions on the 23rd and are still fighting. (3) The Communist troops in Xi County are all fleeing south, claiming to attack Xuzhou. (4) The stronger forces among the Communist troops and local militia groups in various regions of Southern Shandong are all required to gather north of Tai'an within a time limit, and they also claim to invade Jinan. (5) A unit of the New Fourth Army, about 1,000 men, fled from Tai'an to Wande on the 18th to increase defenses. (6) More than 2,000 men from the 9th Liberation Division and more than 3,000 men from Zhao’s Zhou Security 7th Brigade all moved to the northwest of Zhoucun on the 22nd, with a full plan to attack Zhoucun. (7) 1,000 men from Jia Biao's Security unit were added to Longshan on the 25th, and more than 2,000 men from Yuan Yeli's unit were added to Mingshui.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 26th Dispatch] Communist Troops Fleeing to the National Army: (1) Li, the battalion commander of the 1st Battalion of the 6th Regiment of the Communist Party's New Fourth Army, led more than 50 of his men, two machine guns, and one grenade launcher, from Wujialou in Shan County to surrender to the National Army at 10:00 p.m. on the 18th. Because the details were not kept secret, the regiment discovered the attempt and intercepted them, killing the battalion commander and more than a dozen soldiers. (2) Zhang Xiaoyan, a soldier from the 1st Company of the 2nd Independent Battalion of the Communist Army's 8th Division, surrendered to the 77th Division of the National Army with a rifle and a hand grenade.

### Ye Jianying Returns to Duty; Rehe Group Departs Again

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 27th Dispatch] The situation is showing obvious improvement, and auspicious signs are appearing. Within the Military Mediation Department here, the discord has gradually turned into harmony in the past two days. The impression I got from contacting various parties is that there is still much to be done for the future of the country. Ye Jianying, who had been claiming illness and not coming to the Military Mediation Department for a long time, returned to duty today. Cai Wenzhi told reporters in a happy tone that the situation is indeed gradually brightening both inside and outside the customs. The American Chief and Deputy Chiefs of Staff, in addition to resolving many minor difficulties, are also exchanging information with each other, hoping to promote the development of major issues. The information obtained by intelligence personnel yesterday and today has also obviously changed in nature and rarely contains anything unhelpful or rashly provocative. Their enthusiasm to promote the development of the situation is especially valuable. Many executive groups that were not functioning have recently been sent to Rehe again. The Chengde, Chifeng, and Chaoyang groups have begun effective mediation, and the war in that area has stopped. The situation in Jinan is also not excessively serious. An official said: "These actions of the Communist troops are best regarded as a 'war of nerves.'" Chen Yi has assured the group representatives in Linyi that there will definitely be no problems in Jinan. The conflict in the Pingjinbao triangle area will disappear invisibly as the situation changes.

### Foreign Minister Wang Announced at the Memorial Week: We Agree to Conclude a Four-Power Pact; Seek a Reasonable Solution to the Sino-Soviet Problem in the Northeast

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] The Central Memorial Week was held at 9:00 AM on the 27th. Chairman Chiang did not return due to his visit to Shenyang and was chaired by President Yu Youren of the Executive Yuan.

When Wang reported on the Japanese issue, he said: "After careful study and consideration of the proposal by the US Secretary of State to conclude a four-power pact between China, the US, the Soviet Union, and the UK to prevent Japan from rearming and invading again, our government replied to the US government on May 17, agreeing with this policy." Regarding the Northeast problem, Minister Wang said: "The Chinese government will definitely base its policy and friendly spirit to seek a reasonable solution to all issues between China and the Soviet Union and hopes that the leaders of the Soviet government will work with the same spirit according to our efforts." Regarding the withdrawal of Chinese troops stationed in Vietnam, Wang said: "Our troops stationed in Vietnam have been gradually withdrawn and returned to the country and are scheduled to be completely withdrawn within two weeks. One division waiting for ships to Japan in Haiphong will set off for Japan as soon as the ships arrive." The French government has agreed to strictly order the French military and political agencies in Vietnam to grant Chinese people all protections in accordance with the new treaty. The new Sino-French treaty has been approved by both governments, and we sincerely hope that the French-Vietnamese negotiations can achieve satisfactory results. Finally, Minister Wang said: "The Philippines will become independent on July 4, and the British government has declared that it will grant India complete independence. We admire the foresight of the US and British governments in these two events. If the 400 million people of India can also achieve independence and democracy in a peaceful manner like the people of the Philippines and maintain their unity, this is not only a blessing for the people of India but also a major guarantee for peace and prosperity in Asia."

### China Suffered the Most from Japanese Devastation; Reparations Should Begin Sooner; Concrete Plan Carried by Zhu Shiming

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie reviewed the current international situation and diplomatic situation at the Central Memorial Week today. Wang first reviewed the proceedings of the recent Security Council held by the United Nations in New York and the Four Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris, recognizing that although the two meetings faced many difficult problems, our country was determined to stand on the side of justice and fairness, directly or indirectly, to promote their success. Mentioning the issue of Allied control of Japan, Minister Wang next announced that our government had issued a reply on May 17, agreeing to a new US proposal, that is, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and China conclude a treaty with Japan for a period of 20 to 25 years. The content of which is the same as the US, British, Soviet, and French treaty with Germany that the United States intended to propose but did not, so as to thoroughly limit the resurgence of aggression by both Germany and Japan. Wang also reported separately that since our country formally dispatched representatives to the Allied Committee on Japan, our government's position on the Japanese issue has been greatly respected by all parties. The relevant government departments are currently forming concrete plans on the issues of protecting overseas Chinese and reparations. The latter has been carried to Japan by General Zhu Shiming, who recently returned to the country. The content is to request the Allied Committee on Japan to obtain the request of our government to start the Japanese reparations to China earlier before the plan of the Japanese reparations plan prepared by the committee is implemented. China was devastated the most by Japan, and currently needs reparations in order to recover, which is especially pressing. In addition, Foreign Minister Wang announced the following points in the report: (1) The dispatch of Chinese troops stationed in Japan is about to depart. This is to fulfill international obligations and there is absolutely no intention to show off force against Japan. (2) The Soviet Union replied on May 23 to our note of May 10 that the Soviet troops in the Northeast have been completely withdrawn. Negotiations on Sino-Soviet economic cooperation in the Northeast cannot begin temporarily before the sovereignty of the Northeast is completely restored. Our government still consistently believes that the industrial equipment of Japan in the Northeast is not a war trophy, but compensation. (3) France has respected our proposal to protect overseas Chinese in Vietnam, and the National Army in northern Vietnam is expected to be completely withdrawn by June 10. (4) The Philippines officially became independent on July 4, which is a major commemorative event in Asia, and it is expected that its impact will extend to the entire Asia. (5) After the British Cabinet delegation went to India, the British-Indian talks have made considerable new progress. We certainly hope for a satisfactory solution as in the Philippines.

### Draft of Entry and Exit Registration Law for Beijing Completed

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] The statement in the Shanghai newspaper last week that the Beijing Entry and Exit Registration Measures have been implemented is not accurate.

### Chairman Concerned About Food Shortage in Guangdong Province; Relief Measures Handed Over to the Executive Yuan for Approval; Grain and Commodity Prices in Guangdong Gradually Declining

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 27th Dispatch] The food shortage in Guangdong is serious, and Chairman Chiang is also extremely concerned. Representatives of the National Assembly, senators, and provincial and municipal councils of this province have jointly drafted relief measures for the food shortage in Guangdong and telegraphed them to Chairman Chiang for adoption. A reply telegram has now been received, agreeing to hand them over to the Executive Yuan for approval. The original telegram is as follows: (Titles omitted) "I have received the telegram of May 4 regarding the solution to the food shortage in Guangdong and the proposed relief measures have been handed over to the Executive Yuan for earnest approval, Chiang Kai-shek, 17th Year, delivered from Beijing."

Also, current grain prices here have gradually declined. The price of high-quality rice is 55,000 yuan per stone. According to Mr. He Jiping, chairman of the Provincial General Chamber of Commerce, the past surge in grain prices was, of course, partly due to human factors, but the recent reports from various counties on the shortage of rice sources and thus the psychological stimulation of grain prices were the main factors. Now that there has been welcome rain in various rivers and the elimination of the phenomenon, there is hope for a harvest, so grain prices have naturally fallen. According to general observations, grain prices may fall to 40,000 yuan, while other daily necessities such as cloth are also gradually falling due to the increasing number of visitors.

Editorial

### Upholding New Principles of International Law

Yesterday, the United Press continued Reuter's telecommunication, stating that six months ago, twenty-one senior members of the German Socialist Party began their trial by the United Nations on charges such as launching a war. Few of those participating in the trial knew how long the proceedings would last when the case began. If the indictments by various countries were strictly limited to war crimes and the massacre of millions of civilians in Europe, the trial period could be greatly shortened. However, the United Nations, during this trial, will create an environment where those who overthrow recognized international law and treaties and carry out aggressive warfare, whether intentional or not, are included. In essence, the United Nations intends to prove that those who carry out aggressive warfare are guilty, and those in power who support the launch of aggressive warfare are also guilty. The entire apparatus that aids aggression, including the German cabinet and General Staff, is considered a criminal organization. This massive plan has led to the prolongation of the trial. The trial in Nuremberg is ongoing and has not yet concluded. It is naturally impossible to predict what the verdict of the Nuremberg International Tribunal will be in the future. However, based on the prosecutor's indictment and current indications, the trial in Nuremberg is based on the aforementioned principle that those who launch and support aggression are guilty, and the entire apparatus that aids aggression is a criminal organization. This is a new principle in international law. To ensure lasting peace in the future, we support this new principle.

In recent days, American Judge Keene and Chinese Judge Dr. Mei Ruao from the Tokyo International Military Tribunal for the Trial of Japanese War Criminals are traveling from Tokyo to China. We still remember when the trial of Japanese war criminals began in Tokyo earlier this month, the defendants' defense lawyers attempted to impeach the qualifications of the judges, limit the power of the court, reduce the charges, and even attempt to fundamentally overturn the court, so that the Japanese war criminals could escape justice. Now, taking the opportunity of the visit of the American and Chinese judges of the Tokyo International Military Tribunal passing through Shanghai, we would like to contribute our views on the trial of Japanese war criminals.

First, all attempts by the Japanese war criminals' defense lawyers, such as fundamentally overturning the structure of the Tokyo International Military Tribunal or limiting its power, should be fundamentally refuted. In the statements of the Japanese war criminals' defense lawyers, they even mentioned that the Potsdam Declaration was a conditional surrender, which is different from the collapse of Nazi Germany. Germany could have a trial of "war criminals," but Japan, according to these lawyers, does not have "war criminals." Even if there are so-called "war criminals," they are limited to what was recognized by international law at the time, such as killing civilians and mistreating prisoners of war, and do not include those who implement national policies. They also said that the charges of launching a war of aggression and causing disaster to humanity are not found in the international law at the time, nor in the Potsdam Declaration. Therefore, even if the existence of the Tokyo International Military Tribunal itself is not questioned, it can only try general war crimes recognized by international law at the time, such as killing civilians and mistreating prisoners of war. All these attempts, while ostensibly protecting the rights of the defendants, have political significance that outweighs judicial significance. The purpose is to publicly declare and record in official documents that Japan's surrender was conditional, not unconditional. Although the Tokyo International Military Tribunal is a military legal institution, it should not pay attention to political considerations. However, all previous public announcements since the war against Japan, such as the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration itself, are binding international legal documents. Japan's surrender was completely unconditional. All the lawyers' attempts should be unhesitatingly and rigorously refuted according to the law.

Second, to ensure lasting world peace, we sincerely support this new principle of international law, which is that all those who initiate, execute, and support aggression are guilty, and the entire apparatus that aids aggression, including the cabinet and the General Staff, is a criminal organization. International law is originally a living law that grows and develops with changes in the international situation. The past distinctions between combatants and non-combatants, and the limitations on indiscriminate bombing, have become ineffective due to the use of new weapons and new tactics. If this new principle of international law, that those who launch aggression are guilty and the institutions that aid aggression are criminal organizations, is not established in this atomic age, how can future international order be stabilized? The outdated view of war, that war is a continuation of a country's policies and is not inherently a crime, is no longer applicable in this atomic age. Launching a war of aggression is inherently a crime and should be subject to legal sanctions. The establishment of this principle will greatly benefit the maintenance of future international order. To uphold this principle, we feel that the current number of twenty-eight Japanese war criminals on trial in Tokyo is too small. There are indeed some well-known Japanese war criminals who are the masterminds of aggression who are still at large. If they are not brought to justice, how can this new principle of international law be established? We hope that the twenty-eight war criminals on trial are only the first batch of Japanese war criminals to be tried, and that there will be more masterminds of aggression who will be tried and sanctioned by international law.

Third, China has suffered the longest and most severe aggression from Japan. China can submit a large list of war criminals, all of whom are the masterminds of aggression against China. However, since the Tokyo International Military Tribunal is an international tribunal for trials, it may make its work more complicated. China already has military courts that have begun trials. Japanese war criminals who invaded China, whether in Japan or elsewhere, should, if not tried by the Tokyo International Military Tribunal, be arrested and extradited to Chinese courts as soon as possible according to the list provided by the Chinese government, to await sanctions.

After the Second World War, and with the advent of the atomic age, mankind should establish a new international order, which is the abandonment of force and its replacement with international rule of law. To establish this rule-of-law international society, the principle that launching aggression is a crime must first be established. This is why we place earnest hopes on the trials in Nuremberg, and especially in Tokyo.

Changzhou: Fresh Cocoons Enter the Market, Cocoon Merchants Wait and See

The silkworms in the four rural areas of this county are mostly in deep dormancy, and some are showing signs of opening leaves after dormancy. The improved silkworm species have all gone through well, and they can be put on clusters in about a week. Fresh spring cocoons will enter the market successively in early next month. Although 38 cocoon purchasing manufacturers have registered with the silkworm improvement area, it is predicted by relevant parties that they may not be able to fully open their scales at that time. This is because some cocoon merchants do not meet the conditions and have not been able to obtain funds from the silkworm company. They also have hidden worries about the security and guarding of the four rural areas. In addition, the cocoon price is high, and the cost is calculated, which is bound to lead to losses. Therefore, the cocoon merchants have been somewhat hesitant in recent days, and about 30 to 40% have voluntarily given up. It is expected that the actual number of cocoon merchants who will open their scales to purchase cocoons will be less than 30. In addition, the Silkworm Improvement Area of this county, in order to strictly manage the cocoon trade in accordance with regulations and plan to collect fees for silkworm improvement projects, has been handling the following two matters since the 25th. 1. Manufacturers who decide to purchase cocoons shall pay a deposit of 3,000 yuan per dan according to the planned purchase quantity. 2. Unregistered cocoon firms that engage in retail drying and retail purchasing of fresh cocoons shall all register with the area. If any cocoon firm is found to be privately purchasing cocoons or engaging in retail drying, they shall be severely punished.

Jintan: Police Officers Commit Adultery and Break the Law

Wang Wenzhi, a member of the police station in this county, has been repeatedly seeking prostitutes at inns by virtue of his position. On the night of the 11th, he went to the Zhongnan Inn at No. 65 Hua Street, under the pretext of staying there, and forcibly raped Ji Dasao, a female employee of the inn. Ji did not dare to speak out because she was afraid of his power. Unexpectedly, the police officer became even more absurd, disregarding the law. A few days ago, he held a short gun and threatened Chen Rongsheng, the owner of the inn, forcing Chen to provide his wife, Chen Songshi, for him to sleep with. After Chen sternly rebuked him, the police officer became angry out of shame and beat Chen severely to vent his anger before leaving. When the news spread, the whole county was shocked. After suffering such unreasonable humiliation, Chen could no longer bear it and publicly presented a report to the county government and the county party headquarters women's association, requesting protection. After receiving the report, the county government believed that the police officer knew the law and violated the law and harmed social morals. Wang Wenzhi was arrested and interrogated by trial officer Zhu Tujing. Zhu Dasao also testified in court. The defendant could not deny it and admitted the truth. The court ordered him to be remanded and interrogated again on the 27th.

Gaochun: Building a Dike in Xiangtan, Assaulting and Injuring People

In the Xihu Township in the southwest of the lake area, there is the Danyang Lake Beach, which is a joint border area between Jiangsu and Anhui. During the period of the Japanese occupation, an organization called "Limin Kenwu Company" was established, with thousands of workers, all of whom were aliens, building dikes. The project has not been completed. This spring, the company resumed building dikes. The dike area covers about 70,000 mu. However, there are 108 weirs nearby. Due to the mountain floods and the overflowing river water, there is no slow-flowing reservoir. Every year, there is a risk of flooding. The Chun Water Conservancy Committee sent personnel to negotiate before, but it was not approved. Therefore, on May 18, the farmers of the township, seeing that the matter was related to their lives, wanted to stop it. Unexpectedly, a conflict broke out at that time, and both sides used force to fight, resulting in several deaths and injuries. After receiving the report, the county government immediately sent the county security squadron to take the murderers and the injured to the county for legal proceedings.

Taixing: The Communist Army is Very Active in Tai County

The Communist army in the four suburbs of this county is working more and more intensively. In addition to the routine kidnapping, extortion, and looting of people's wealth, and the killing of people, they have recently increased the number of troops and are very active in the third, fourth, and fifth districts and Huangqiao and other places. According to reliable sources, the Communist army's political workers have recently been forcibly levying two cotton quilts and one door panel from each bao in each township, as well as one tall bamboo ladder, in preparation for combat. If anyone refuses to comply, they will be treated as violating military orders and "killed." On the one hand, they concentrate the militia team and assign the militia two tasks: (1) Organize a harvesting team to rush to harvest wheat seedlings in various border areas and universally arm for defense. (2) Organize a sabotage team to sabotage highways on the Chenghuang and Jinghuang lines, causing traffic between Chenghuang to be cut off, and there are no pedestrians. Heavy troops are also deployed around the Shili Temple outside the east of the city, where the national army is stationed, and landmines are buried, in an attempt to attack our county town.

Hefei: The Ministry of Finance Lists the Province's Revenue

(2) Regulatory fee income of 3 million yuan. (3) Property interest income of 3 million yuan. (4) Revenue from publicly owned enterprises of 6 million yuan. (5) Other income of 3 million yuan. (6) Revenue from the sale of publicly owned property and materials of 2 million yuan. (7) Publicly owned business surplus income of 30 million yuan, totaling 49 million yuan. After receiving the telegram notification, the provincial government slightly adjusted the original number according to the actual situation in the province, compiled a revenue distribution table, and reported it to the ministry for record, and ordered compliance.

[This newspaper's report] San Francisco, 27th Broadcast: Industrial unrest in the United States, one wave subsiding, another rises. Although the railway strike last week has ended, the United States is now facing another industrial crisis. All workers in the bituminous coal mines, which have already been taken over by the government, went on strike today, challenging President Truman.

Another report: Powerful parties in the US Senate today rejected granting President Truman emergency powers to deal with any labor unrest that opposes the government. However, government leaders are confident that they can break the opposition's power next week.

[Central News Agency Washington, 26th, United Press] This morning at 4:00 AM (Greenwich Mean Time), the US government returned the railways it had taken over on the 17th to private operation.

[United Press Washington, 26th] President Truman negotiated with Coal Miners Union President Lewis at the White House today in a last-minute effort to avert the strike, but no agreement was reached. Interior Secretary Krug is scheduled to continue negotiations with Lewis tomorrow.

[United Press New York, 26th] National Maritime Union President Curran announced today that regardless of what legislation Congress passes, the general strike of national maritime workers will proceed as scheduled on June 15. However, at that time, the Maritime Union will still maintain legal bargaining and troop transports will continue to operate as usual. The seven national maritime unions have a total of 200,000 members. Curran made this speech to the Industrial Organizations Federation Standing Committee, which represents 600,000 workers in New York City.

### Molotov's Speech Explains Soviet Attitude; Reaffirms Opposition to Convening a 21-Nation Peace Conference Before an Agreement is Reached Among the Great Powers

[United Press London, 27th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today denied that Chairman Stalin had agreed to the suggestion of US Secretary of State Byrnes for a 25-year treaty with Germany and issued a warning that if Byrnes insists on convening a peace conference before conditions are ripe, the relationship among the four powers may deteriorate. Molotov claimed that Britain and the United States are using economic assistance as a means to try to control Italy and other countries, so that these countries can become tools for further promoting capitalist policies. He said that Britain and the United States should be held responsible for the failure of the Paris Conference and pointed out that the United States is assisting Britain in maintaining its monopoly in the Mediterranean, and that the two countries had agreed in advance to jointly deal with the Soviet Union's .

[Reuters London, 27th] Moscow Telegraph quoted a speech made by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to the press today, explaining the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference, which stated: Certain countries obviously want to impose their will on others. Certain factions in the United States, with the help of their British friends, want to establish a chain of naval and air bases all over the world. However, during the war, at the Yalta, Tehran, and Potsdam Conferences, the views of the participating countries were consistent, and resolutions were established. However, certain countries now obviously want to impose their will on others, and some people have come out to oppose the order among the Allied countries, turning the conference room into a place of debate and quarrel. When the Soviet delegation went to Paris, it was determined to fulfill the resolutions of the Moscow Conference and was unwilling to discuss the treaty until a preliminary agreement was reached among the great powers on the treaty. Although Italy has changed its regime, the Soviet Union cannot regard it as an equal country on the Allied side. Regarding the draft treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, certain items have now yielded concrete results. The treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Finland can be regarded as drafted and ready, but it is not in the interests of the Danube countries to interfere with the interests of the Danube countries, especially for Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, which cannot be agreed upon. Regarding the issue of Italian reparations, in 1941 and 1942, fascist Italian troops attacked the Soviet Union, destroying many Soviet cities and causing significant losses to our country. Fascist Italian troops also invaded Yugoslavia, Greece, Albania, and other countries, causing them significant losses. However, considering that they established a democratic government in the final stage of the war, which was not without help, we now demand fair compensation in a moderate way. It is impossible not to impose appropriate punishment on Italy. The countries that have not had their territory invaded now believe that the US occupation forces are heavily burdened in Italy, as documented in the Italian newspapers. Therefore, if this expense can be slightly reduced, even by millions of dollars, it can enable Italy to fulfill its claim for compensation to the Soviet Union. We are well aware that the Italian people have insufficient food, but fulfilling the compensation claim will only add to their suffering. The reason why Britain and the United States oppose it is that it will make the two countries help Italy pay this compensation, which is not a pertinent argument. It has not been possible to successfully negotiate the draft peace treaty with Italy, which lacks the harmonious and cooperative understanding of the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam Conferences during the war. The Paris Conference proposed convening a 21-nation peace conference to discuss the draft peace treaties before an agreement was reached. The Soviet delegation believes that this violates the principles of Allied cooperation and therefore rejected it.

### Representatives of the Four Foreign Ministers Met in Paris Yesterday to Discuss the French-Italian Border Issue

[This newspaper's report] London, 27th Broadcast: Representatives of the four foreign ministers held a meeting in Paris this afternoon to discuss the French-Italian border issue and prepare for the foreign ministers' meeting to be held on June 15.

### Reported Stalin's Proposal to the US: Negotiate a Treaty of Friendship and Remove the "Iron Curtain" in Central Europe

(United Press Washington, 26th) According to newspaper columnist Pearson's broadcast today, Marshal Stalin has proposed that the Soviet Union and the United States negotiate a treaty of friendship and remove the "Iron Curtain" stretching across Central Europe. However, State Department officials stated they had no knowledge of this proposal.

### Adjusting to New World Strategic Perspective: Readjustment of the British Commonwealth Defense System; Conference of Dominion Prime Ministers Concludes

[Reuters London, 26th] The conference of Dominion Prime Ministers has just concluded. It is reported that they have agreed on a new perspective of world strategy, reforming the traditional British system and adjusting the imperial defense system. The suggestion of distributing industrial materials by imperial leaders and having each region administer its own defense has been overturned. The strategic details discussed are being kept secret by the authorities. However, attendees have made the following three hints: (1) The Mediterranean can no longer remain a "British lake." (2) India, with its 350 million people, was originally a stronghold of the British Empire system, but it may no longer be so in the future. (3) The development of air force and atomic bomb warfare has completely changed the concept of national defense during the Second World War. Therefore, the discussion focused on adapting to this changing situation and conforming to the new world strategy, to be implemented within the Commonwealth system.

### French Troops Cross the Mekong River: Invade Siamese Territory; Capture Longkai, Advancing on Phra Tabong; Franco-Siamese Secret Negotiations Declared a Failure

[This Newspaper's Report] London, 27th Radio: Secret negotiations between France and Siam, which have been going on for two months, focusing on the Siam-Vietnam border issue, have completely failed. The Siamese delegation has departed for Saigon.

[United Press Bangkok, 26th] According to news from the Siamese-Vietnamese border today, 800 French troops, equipped with aircraft and artillery, crossed the Mekong River five miles southeast of Viet Zeng in Vietnam, invading Siamese territory and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with a mixed force of Siamese police and civilians. According to the report, the fighting broke out last Friday. At dawn that day, the first batch of French troops crossed the river five miles southeast of the Viet Zeng occupied area. An hour and a half later, reinforcements arrived, and the French troops began to advance eastward, subsequently capturing Longkai in Siam, with the intention of concentrating on attacking Phra Tabong. The Siamese defense line was forced to retreat ten miles westward.

[Reuters Bangkok, 26th] The Siamese government issued a communiqué today stating that French troops crossed the Mekong River border at two points this morning, occupied Taipo, and advanced towards Journalists' Hill. The Siamese government has lodged a complaint with the United Nations and has requested the intervention of the British and American governments, seeking a peaceful resolution through diplomatic channels. When the French troops invaded, the Siamese police initially resisted, but then retreated inland. French troops bombed Longkai, and French aircraft also conducted reconnaissance deep inside Siam.

According to reports from Bangkok on the 8th of this month, French troops bombed Siam's Nakhon Phanom on the banks of the Mekong River and strafed Thai islands with machine guns. After the incident, the Siamese cabinet convened an emergency meeting and sent a letter of protest to the British and American ministers to Siam to be forwarded to Paris.

### Nehru Makes a Statement: India Must Be Completely Independent; Should Have Equal Status with British Dominions; Expresses Deep Regret over the Terrorist Rule in Kashmir

[This Newspaper's Report] London, 27th Radio: Nehru stated today that India must have complete freedom and should enjoy absolute equality with Britain and its Dominions.

[Reuters New Delhi, 27th] After the Maharaja of Kashmir left the Indian state of Kashmir, located at the southern foot of the Himalayas, its chairman Sheikh Abdullah and several leaders were arrested last week as a result. After this incident, Nehru, the chairman of the Congress Party, issued a statement yesterday, saying that assassinations occur daily in Srinagar, the capital of the state, and that women are not spared. Innocent residents are often forced to crawl in the streets and are ordered to remove their headscarves to wipe the ground. The bodies of those killed are not allowed to be claimed by relatives and are soaked in gasoline and burned. The state authorities are using such methods to suppress the people's movement, which is beyond the authority of any government. The Kashmir National Conference and the Indian People's Conference (Nehru himself is the chairman of the Indian People's Conference) have long sought to establish autonomous governments in the Indian states. This objective has gained the support of the people of Kashmir. Unexpectedly, the state government has adopted high-pressure terrorist measures, which is extremely regrettable and should be stopped.

### Cessation of Reparations Deliveries in the US Occupation Zone in Germany: US Claims This Move is to Protect the Economy of the Area; Britain and France Will Announce the Same Ban

[United Press Berlin, 26th] Lieutenant General Clay, Deputy Commander of the US Occupation Zone in Germany, announced tonight that, in order to accelerate the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement and to manage Germany as a whole economically, the United States has decided to stop delivering reparations from its occupation zone, except for factories that have already been allocated. This move by the United States is to protect the economy of the area in order to prevent the permanent non-implementation of the Potsdam Agreement (which is now considered highly likely in some respects), which would lead to Germany being permanently divided into east and west, with the east occupied by the Soviet Union and the west by other United Nations. The ban on movement includes all reparations claims. Britain and France have not yet announced the same ban, but it is generally believed here that they will follow the US lead. The dismantling and shipping of factories allocated within the British occupation zone is slightly behind that of the US occupation zone. In the US occupation zone, about fifteen to twenty factories have been allocated to countries claiming reparations, and these factories will still be completely delivered. The remaining 150 factories available for reparations will not be dismantled and shipped for the time being, but will be disposed of after the following points in the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement have been addressed: 1. Management of Germany as a single economic entity, and the establishment of necessary central institutions; 2. Restoration of Germany's import and export trade, providing credit and loans to pay for imported food and necessary raw materials; 3. Establishment of free international trade to assist the crippled economy of the US occupation zone and prevent the gradual decline of its industrial production again, by using raw materials that the Soviet Union and other occupation zones can supply.

### Scientists in US Unsure About the Possibility of Making a Cosmic Ray Bomb

### Yuan Ludeng to be Sentenced on the 29th; Writes Will in Prison; Claims He Lived His Life Without Wronging Anyone; Prosecutor Xia Read Aloud the Indictment with Vehemence; After Adjournment, Meets with Family and Children in Mutual Grief

[Our Report] Yuan Ludeng, one of the "Three Elders" of Shanghai, has been tried twice by the Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, Presiding Judge Xiao and Judges Feng and Wang opened a debate court. In addition to the original three lawyers, Chen Rui, Li Shisen, and Chao Jimei, who were obliged to defend the defendant, the High Court also appointed lawyer Zhang Danping as the designated defender. After submitting more than ten pieces of evidence, an intense debate ensued, lasting one hour and twenty minutes, with the sentencing scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 31st of this month. The defense argued that the defendant's detention has exceeded eight months and requested bail, and the court will file a separate application.

Mentally Depressed, Staggering

When Yuan arrived in court yesterday, he had changed into a gray, unlined long gown, with coffee-colored trousers underneath, black shoes, and white socks. His complexion was paler than before, and the short hair on his forehead was almost entirely white. He appeared mentally depressed and staggered as he walked. Presiding Judge Xiao, therefore, specially provided a wooden chair, instructing him to sit beside the defendant's seat to answer questions. When first asked about the establishment of the Baojia system and the Rice Control Association, Yuan stated that he took on these roles to safeguard the security and sustenance of the Shanghai citizens, driven by a desire to serve society, and certainly not to ingratiate himself with the enemy for personal gain. He also said, "Because I am a businessman, I may not understand the law and may not know that it is a crime, but I have always done things for others and never done anything to harm others for my own benefit, so I have always been considerate of others. Even the defense lawyers this time are all volunteering to defend me." Regarding the "Rice Control Association's" purchase of rice, he testified, "The rice was obtained by us from various places, but each time it was taken away by the Japanese army. When we needed to use it, we had to borrow it from them. In the first three months, we could still borrow it, but later they refused to lend it anymore, and I had no choice but to resign." Lawyers Chen Rui and Chao Jimei presented evidence to defend the employees. At this point, Prosecutor Xia Lili read aloud Yuan's crimes of treason with vehemence, making Yuan unable to look directly at him. After he finished speaking, lawyer Chen Tingrui responded to the charges listed in the indictment, especially regarding the establishment of the Baojia system and the Rice Control Association, with more detailed arguments. The gist of his argument was the same as Yuan's own testimony, so I will not repeat it here. Then, lawyer Zhang defended, listing the inaccuracies of the crimes charged by the prosecutor.

Insists on Surrender, Denies Arrest

Finally, Presiding Judge Xiao asked Yuan again, "Is there anything else you want to say?" Yuan solemnly denied being arrested, strongly asserting that he surrendered himself. The court debate concluded, and sentencing was scheduled for the 29th of this month. After the adjournment, Yuan requested to see his family, and his children and others wept together, speechless. Yuan had also written a will in prison, which is transcribed in full below: "Throughout my life, I have never done anything against my conscience. Since childhood, I have adhered to family teachings, cherishing things and loving people. Later, I followed the teachings of the sages, embracing universal love and taking loyalty and forgiveness as my principles, teaching tirelessly. Although I have not achieved great accomplishments, I believe I have not committed any major transgressions. Fortunately, Heaven has blessed me, allowing me to enjoy a peaceful family life and receiving the goodwill of society, leaving me with no regrets. However, in adapting to the environment, I often could not do as I wished. If I suffer misfortune due to misunderstanding, I will accept it with equanimity, without blaming Heaven or others. I only hope that my children will carry on my aspirations, contributing to society as much as possible, protecting the family, and informing my disciples and all those who share my ideals to always uphold the principle of self-discipline and benefiting others, striving to realize my unfinished aspirations, so that my spirit will not die. This is especially important to me. Farewell."

### Xie Baosheng's First Trial: Speaks Like a Street Thug; Frankly Says: If Guilty, Proceed Quickly

[Our Report] Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, Xie Baosheng, one of Shanghai's "important figures," was interrogated. Xie, from Chongming County, is 64 years old. Before the war, he served as the captain and deputy inspector of the Detective Brigade of the Shanghai Special Municipal Police Bureau and was acquainted with the traitor Chen Qun. In September of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), when Chen defected to the enemy and became the puppet governor of Jiangsu Province, Xie also betrayed the Central Government and took the position of deputy director of the Police Department of the puppet Jiangsu Province, assisting the director in handling police affairs throughout the province for more than two years. As a result, the original administrative structure was completely destroyed, and the people suffered greatly from local oppression. Moreover, he used the convenience of his position to recruit followers and amass wealth, his crimes being obvious. After resigning, he resided in Shanghai and was arrested by the Military Intelligence Bureau. After investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office, he was prosecuted in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for Punishing Traitors.

When Xie was brought to trial yesterday morning, he was corpulent, wearing a loose gray practical long gown, yellow leather shoes, and white trousers. His hair was already balding, but his spirits were quite good. He claimed that in his more than sixty years of life, he had never entered a police station or attended school, had not graduated, had little education, and did not know many characters, having been in business since childhood. In the 16th year of the Republic (1927), when Shen Honglie was the director of the Shanghai Police Bureau, he served as an inspector for two months. He also worked as an administrative officer on the Zhaoshang Bureau's Xinmin steamship and later on the Changxing ship on the Yangtze River run by Du Yuesheng. During the "August 13th" Incident, he organized the "Youth Battlefield Service Corps," rescuing wounded soldiers and procuring cement and steel bars for the defense forces in the Wenzhou and Taizhou areas, risking his life to supply materials for the construction of defensive fortifications. The puppet Jiangsu Police Department governed 23 counties (Xie mistakenly referred to it as Lu Province, causing laughter in the courtroom), but he was only nominally in charge and could not handle affairs. The claim that he "widely recruited followers" was untrue, claiming that he only had a few dozen. His son, Xie Wenyan, graduated from the Central Military Academy and was arrested by the Japanese army with his younger brother on May 2nd of last year, tortured for eleven days, eventually being released without incident due to Chen Qun's help. Xie had the air of a "street thug," speaking very frankly, claiming that he wore a police uniform to avoid harassment from black marketeers and searches by Japanese military police at the train station. Finally, he said, "If I am guilty, proceed quickly; if I am not guilty, release me quickly!" The court adjourned the hearing for a later date, and the defendant was remanded in custody. When he met with his family, his wife cried bitterly, and his son's eyes were full of tears, but he himself calmly consoled them, asking them to set their minds at ease.

Li Zuyu Continues Trial. National Socialist Party member Li Zuyu, who had successively served as Vice Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Transportation, Vice Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Industry, Counselor of the Puppet National Government, and Director of the Planning Department of the Puppet Chamber of Commerce, willingly submitted to the enemy, colluding with the enemy to plot against our country. Li still attempted to evade responsibility, falsely claiming to have rescued the literary scholar Zhao Jingshen's father, Li Xitong, and Fang Yingda, etc. After the judge inquired in detail, he also ordered the trial to be adjourned to a later date.

Xie Baosheng suffered from ear problems and assumed an attitude of cupping his ear and straining to hear during the trial.

(2) The government should subsidize private schools 5,000,000 to 10,000,000 yuan per term, depending on the number of classes, and all faculty and staff should receive the same treatment as public schools. (3) The government should designate a national bank or municipal bank to grant each school a low-interest loan of 5,000,000 to 10,000,000 yuan per term. (4) The free tuition places set up by private schools were originally intended to facilitate the children of public school teachers. In addition to waiving tuition and miscellaneous fees, food expenses should be subsidized by the government.

### Schools Will Go Bankrupt Due to Unrest, Resulting in Students Having No Books to Read: Director Xu of Zhejiang Department of Education Reports Educational Crisis

[Our Report from Hangzhou] Director Xu Shaodi of the Zhejiang Department of Education reported on the province's education budget and the current financial difficulties of the provincial education agencies at the provincial government's weekly memorial meeting. The following is an investigation and report: The total amount of the provincial education budget for this year is 65,515,000 yuan for regular expenses and 294,750,000 yuan for temporary expenses, in addition to 2,906,000 yuan in supplementary expenditure funds managed by the Department of Education. The 60 million yuan in regular expenses include the annual operating and administrative expenses of more than 50 units, including provincial schools and social education agencies. The 290 million yuan in temporary expenses include equipment fees, school building repair fees, and the main and non-staple food expenses of all public-funded teachers and vocational school students in provincial schools, the majority of which are student meal expenses. These will be described separately below: Regular Expenses (1) The entire year's expenses for the Department of Education are 2,635,000 yuan. This small amount is barely enough to maintain regular administration, and it is quite difficult to hold any temporary events, let alone improve education.

A Drop in the Bucket, of No Help

(2) There are a total of 31 provincial secondary schools and above. Currently, only 11 schools still have fixed school buildings, but they are also badly damaged. The estimated repair costs are alarming, but only 60 million yuan has been received in demobilization funds. Of this 60 million yuan, the maintenance costs of taking over the puppet schools must also be deducted, so the demobilization funds allocated to each school are like a drop in the bucket and of no help. The schools are currently unable to restore their former appearance, let alone achieve the goal of improvement. The difficulties in running the schools are not limited to this. The total amount of education funds for this year is the same as last year, but the number of classes naturally increases every year, and the cost of living is so high that no matter how the Department of Education plans the budget, it always feels extremely difficult. The funds for the provincial schools are not only tight, but also cannot be received on time, because they have to go through many twists and turns and complicated procedures, which makes the situation even more difficult. In particular, the public grain matter from the past, such as the public grain and rice money for the 34th year of the Republic (1945), has not been received to this day. The schools are urgently unable to cope and are in extreme difficulty. Students blame the schools for their food, causing the principals to lose heart. This situation really cannot be maintained for long. If this continues, it may cause ten or so schools to go bankrupt due to unrest, resulting in students having no books to read.

Losing Sight of One Thing for Another, Feeling Thorny

(3) The funding for provincial halls and venues is even more difficult. Except for the Provincial Library and Museum, which have a small maintenance budget, the budgets for the Provincial Hangzhou People's Education Center and the Hangzhou Sports Field, among others, have been completely cut. Currently, the salaries of the curators and venue directors are all paid by the Department of Education, losing sight of one thing for another, making it feel thorny. Secondly, the largest expenditure under temporary expenses is student meal expenses. This year, there are a total of 7,800 public-funded students and normal school students in provincial middle schools, with each student receiving 4,000 yuan per month for main and non-staple food expenses in January, 5,000 yuan each in February and March, and 8,000 yuan each from April to October. In addition, there are 1,180 vocational students, with each student receiving 2,500 yuan per month for main and non-staple food expenses in January, 3,000 yuan each in February and March, and 5,000 yuan each from April to October. The central government originally approved the calculation based on only 6,000 students, a difference of more than 2,000 students, so the funds are short by 125,290,000 yuan. Finally, regarding the expenditure of temporary subsidies, there are currently 225 secondary schools and above in this province. Apart from the provincial schools, there are a total of 194 units. If each unit is allocated an average amount, it will only be more than 10,000 yuan. Therefore, it is difficult to grant the requests for subsidies from private schools in various counties. In the past few years, education funding has also been difficult, and Chairman Huang has tried his best to advocate the allocation of grain reserves at changing prices to supplement education funding. Now, Chairman Shen advocates being the same as the Ministry of Food and not using the method of using grain reserves. In the future, the provincial government will have to find other ways. Therefore, the education cause in this province will be facing an even more difficult situation. If the funding cannot be resolved, it is possible that the enrollment of public-funded students and the vocational school students enjoying public grain treatment will be suspended in the next semester, or even the enrollment will be temporarily suspended and the number of classes will be reduced. However, there is a contradictory phenomenon in society, that is, as a result of the promotion of national education, the number of graduates from primary and junior high schools increases year by year, and the need to add classes to middle schools is becoming more and more urgent.

[Ta Hua News Agency, Nanjing] In order to rapidly restore secondary schools in recovered provinces and municipalities and actively promote secondary education, the Ministry of Education has formulated the following incentive measures: All secondary schools in Jiangsu, Shandong, Fujian, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Henan, Hebei, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, etc., and in Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao, Ping, Tianjin, etc., will use the number established before the war as a benchmark.

However, this is temporarily limited to provincial, municipal, and excellent private schools.

### Respecting Teachers and Soliciting Donations: Yesterday's Results Were Good; Art and Calligraphy Charity Sale Also Achieved Results

[Our Newspaper] The student donation teams of the Teacher Respect Movement in this city solicited donations from shops throughout the city yesterday. It is reported that a certain team from Datong University raised one million yuan. A certain team from Soochow University raised 250,000 yuan, with a total of 60 million yuan for the entire school. A certain team from Qilu Middle School raised 300,000 yuan, and other schools and teams raised amounts ranging from 200,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan, and some raised several thousand yuan. The total amount cannot yet be estimated. This kind of group activity of accumulating sand into a tower is more meritorious for educational construction than building a seven-story pagoda. Yesterday's weather was very hot. More than 20,000 students solicited donations door-to-door and were quite hardworking. Many shop managers, seeing this situation, personally came out to greet them and voluntarily filled out donation forms. A certain public organization on Xizang Road sent a special person to take care of them by the roadside, providing tea. It is estimated that 26 dan of boiled water were used in one day. A certain soda company replaced tea with soda, and all 600 dozen bottles in stock were sold out in half a day. This generosity is truly admirable. The manager of a certain raincoat factory declared that he would donate 500,000 yuan in cash to various donation teams, but only once per school. All the students, encouraged and supported by the shops and companies, will continue to go around soliciting donations today, striving to reach the target of 150,000,000 yuan. The Teacher Respect Committee issued an urgent notice yesterday, which was conveyed by the China Middle School bicycle team to the various donation teams along the way. It stated: "This committee has received instructions from the Chief Executive that student donation teams should target shops as the only targets and must not obstruct vehicles. The donations received should be recorded in the donation book at any time and sent to nearby banks (see the back of the donation book for the list of banks). Please pay attention to this." (Ren)

### Overseas Chinese Join Forces to Relieve the Famine in the Motherland: 260,000 Tons of Siamese Rice Shipped to China; Actively Planning to Develop Nanyang Trade

[Our Newspaper] Zheng Wulou, chairman of the Siamese Overseas Chinese Relief Committee for the Famine in the Motherland, is a large merchant in the local area. Together with Lian Yingzhou, chairman of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and many other leaders of the Overseas Chinese industrial and commercial community, they transferred from Chongqing to Nanjing to discuss with government officials on relieving the famine and developing Nanyang trade. They have now completed their public duties and arrived in Shanghai. It is reported that 260,000 tons of rice from Siam have been shipped in three batches. It is possible that cotton cloth, hardware, tea, etc. will be shipped from here. It is heard that the huge amount of foreign rice has been fully entrusted to the Ministry of Food for fair-price distribution, but the location is not limited to Shanghai. Yesterday, the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association held a banquet to exchange views. Mr. Zheng expressed his willingness to do his best to help solve the food shortage in the motherland, and said that the export trade to Nanyang must be opened up. Mr. Lian also expressed that the Nanyang market is willing to establish contact with the motherland. The two gentlemen have proposed several methods: (1) Apply for the government to open up exports to Nanyang and urge diplomatic envoys to go there to provide political assistance and lift the discrimination against Chinese goods by the former local government; (2) Establish import and export banks and trade banks in the motherland; (3) Exchange samples with the domestic industrial community. The person in charge of the association expressed their willingness to assist and put forward suggestions: (1) The quality and packaging of exported products should be improved, and the association can issue certificates in the future to prevent abuses; (2) Please send suitable goods for sale at any time for review. The new products here will also be compiled by the association and sent to Nanyang; (3) The opening of export trade to Nanyang may not have a significant effect in a short time due to unfavorable exchange rates, but from the standpoint of the Chinese nation, we should prepare in advance to strive for this good market. In addition, opinions were put forward by industry leaders such as Mr. Qiang and Mr. Jin of the dyeing and weaving industry. The Overseas Chinese representatives all expressed that everyone should abandon personal concepts and cooperate. It is heard that clothing is extremely scarce in Singapore and Siam, but if domestic goods are shipped, the price will be double that of Australian goods under the current circumstances. Whether the market can avoid falling into other hands depends on whether the exchange rate can be improved. A joint Overseas Chinese bank will be established in Shanghai, and an import and export bank will be established with a plan of 4 million to 10 million Siamese currency. Major dyeing and weaving factories will pass the samples to the association for forwarding. The Chamber of Commerce in this city will also unite with various important industry associations to entertain them again.

After several negotiations between buyers and sellers, each "zu" (a unit of measurement) was sold for 120,000 yuan, and the market atmosphere was considered stable. Other grades saw consistent trading in and out, and the trend continued to stabilize. However, the quality of the new Longjing tea arriving in Shanghai from various production areas is visibly deteriorating, so prices have slightly decreased. However, the situation is a subtle decline rather than a sharp one. As for Qimen black tea and Dafang green tea, sales are relatively active, but the supply is very tight, and the foothold may be difficult to consolidate. The demand for Gong green tea sold to Mumbai, India, is holding steady, and medium grades can still be purchased.

### Woolen Fabric Transactions Scarce, Prices Flat

Because retail business continued to decline, summer goods prices were firm and about to be removed, autumn goods were in short supply, and sales were still early. Although a small amount of American goods continued to arrive, there were no definite arrivals of British goods. However, in general, both merchants and the public ultimately believe that woolen fabrics will eventually arrive, and because prices are more than half cheaper, they are willing to postpone purchases, leading to a gradual decline in retail and wholesale transactions.

### Factory Inventory Dwindling, Customer Sales Brisk, Cloth Market Price Surge Intensifies

The price of grey cloth continues to rise due to shortages, and with constant purchases from all parties, market sentiment is increasingly bullish. Some believe that the goods allocated by the China Textile Corporation are all being discounted, so those holding goods are even more reluctant to sell at lower prices. There is an urgent demand for dyed cloth, serge, gabardine, and umbrella silk from merchants from Sichuan, but factory inventories are dwindling, and the price surge is intensifying. There is demand from Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan, Tianjin, Shanxi, Ningbo, and the Beijing-Shanghai area. The shouting at the Leyuan Tea House is very loud. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth is priced as high as 53,500 yuan, 3A Caichou is 51,000 yuan, and serge is 56,000 yuan. Later, it was heard that the price of gold had fallen, and market sentiment eased. At the same time, those who had profited from the surge released their goods, and the price fell by 500 to 1,000 yuan from the high price, but existing merchants still had inventory.

### Changchun Twenty-Nine Days (10)

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Shao Shenzhi

Language barriers, never understood. Translated to them, it was still "no." Said that since it's not yours, you don't need to take care of it, cursing and punching Beckett in the chest. We were wary that this move was not simple, quietly calling the communist soldiers guarding the door. At this time, everyone heard the noise and ran downstairs to see, the workers also came, but the Swiss friends remained in the reception room. These soldiers were still pointing and cursing. Insisting on borrowing. "You guys, you can't escape." When the leader saw the workers, he immediately taught them a lesson:

"What are you still doing here? You have been liberated, why are you serving these youngsters? We are serving the people, you go away." Several workers saw the tense situation and immediately slipped away.

The guard at the door came in and asked where they were from. They replied that they were from the 27th Division, 21st Brigade, looking still very fierce. When asked their names, they hesitated and did not say, showing an oily attitude: "Tell you, my name is Ma, so what?" As a result, the guard was also angered. Four or five soldiers with guns escorted them out.

Not long after, these treasures came again with guns. We were really worried that they would clash, but there was no conflict. Finally, they took what they wanted to borrow.

### Protest to Mao Zedong

From the 16th to the 27th, we were detained for a full eleven days. We exhausted a lot of effort to plead with Zhou Baozhong of the Chinese Communist Party to restore our freedom, but requests were made, but ignored. Day after day, these short eleven days felt like long eleven years. We looked from inside to outside, but saw the withered willows, which had changed from a scorched yellow color to a lovely green. This green world is explaining that the spring fire of our hearts is still far away!

On the evening of the 27th, it was also the day before Major Reich was to fly back to Shenyang (as a result, the flight was delayed until the 29th due to gasoline problems). We prepared some of his favorite dishes to send him off. When he was with us, his empathy and humor solved a lot of our loneliness.

When we had finished dinner, everyone realized that this was an opportunity: our long and unreasonable detention should be protested to Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party. We asked Major Reich to bring this message out for us. Major Reich, seeing the difficulty of our situation, resolutely agreed to our request.

Madsen of the Associated Press and Wheeler of the Chicago Daily News took on the task of drafting, but Chinese colleagues, feeling the difficulty of their situation, decided to withdraw. But they declared that they were consistent with them in spirit. The translated text of the letter of protest is as follows:

"To Mr. Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Yan'an Central Executive Committee:

We, the undersigned five American journalists, hereby protest to you because we have been detained in Changchun by the Communist Army of the Chinese Communist Party since the evening of April 16th and have been completely isolated from the outside world until now.

At the beginning, Major General Liu Qiren, the commander of the attacking army in the west, told us that for the sake of our safety, he had to set up guards around us. As long as the war was over, we could move freely immediately.

General Liu has said this to us, and it has been a full eleven days. The war has subsided for a long time, but we still cannot move freely in Changchun. The guards clearly told us that they were carrying out orders given to them by their superiors. This order is to prevent us from going out and also to prevent our friends from visiting.

Zhou Baozhong, the commander of the Changchun Garrison, also told us that in order to "protect our safety" from "Kuomintang secret agents," we were not allowed to go out. Since April 18th, we have met with three senior officers of the Chinese Communist Party. We have all protested to them, and we are willing to issue a voluntary letter of "no accident and no involvement," which means that in this quiet city, we will no longer cause the Communist army to worry about our safety, but everyone has refused us. Since April 19th, we have only gone out twice under guard "on order." Once, after we obtained permission from a guard to take shots of a burning house, another officer came and took away our two cameras. It has not been returned to this day.

Under the watchful eyes of guards, letting us walk on the streets of Changchun, letting us walk in front of many Japanese people who were formerly our enemies but are now freely swaying on the streets, we deeply feel that this is a great shame, so we no longer consider this questionable right to go out. We admit that the senior generals of the Chinese Communist Party are very polite to us, but their efforts are to restrict our freedom and delay our return to Shenyang.

We have heard the principle of freedom of the press in Yan'an. We have also discussed this issue with the CCP representatives in Chongqing, but our current situation is the exact opposite.

We are neutral journalists, reporting on the news of both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. We hereby request your immediate freedom."

### Acknowledging the Execution of Mistakes

We had no real freedom until May 2nd, after contacting the Communist Army for twenty days. Zhou Baozhong repeatedly stated that it was to protect our "safety," and that if something happened to us, the CCP would not be able to take responsibility. Even if we were willing to sign a document for Zhou to disclaim responsibility, he said that he still could not take responsibility, which means: he insisted on taking responsibility. Why were we then stabbed with bayonets? Why did the Communist Army fire guns in our circle? Why did the Communist Army punch Beckett in the chest? We find it hard to believe that all this was well-intentioned.

At first, the quartermaster had to ask the guards for permission to go to the street to buy groceries. We really had to thank the two quartermasters and the three workers. The Communist Army had incited them (we believe not on the orders of their superiors, but as a result of their usual education) to not take care of us, but in twenty days, they have become our best friends.

Later, Kai Feng, the director of the Propaganda Department of the CCP Northeast Bureau, expressed his apologies to Shenzhi in a conversation, saying, "The Northeast Bureau only instructed the Changchun side to be responsible for protecting your safety. I didn't expect that you would lose your freedom as a result. It would have been better if the Northeast Bureau had come earlier." (The CCP Northeast Bureau moved to Changchun from Jilin on May 1st.) Shenzhi asked Kai Feng, "Does this mean that the occurrence of this incident was due to the mechanical execution of orders?" Kai Feng said:

"Yes, it was a little too mechanical."

Kai Feng came to see us at his residence on the afternoon of May 2nd and asked about the whereabouts of the TASS reporter. He replied that he did not know that there was a TASS reporter here. Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Baiyu, who was one of the CCP reporters in the Beiping Executive Headquarters, came to Shenyang with the Northeast team. We were originally in Shenyang and welcomed every new colleague very much, but he suddenly appeared in Changchun. He did not come to see us when the Changchun Central News Agency was changed to Xinhua News Agency. (To be continued)

### Rocket with a Range of Forty-Three Miles

Engineers at Douglas Aircraft Company are studying ionospheric rockets. The rocket has a range of forty-three miles, setting a new record and can test the effects of the outer atmosphere on climate.

### Jiaxing in Crisis

— This Newspaper 19th News, Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

Jiaxing is the center of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and one of the bases of the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area, known as paradise. The reporter arrived in Jiaxing by noon train from Hangzhou on the 15th. I went straight to the countryside and saw a group of farmers harvesting wheat. They were a little scared when they first saw me. Later, when I asked them about the actual situation, they told me: "The rice is all mixed up, and now we have to buy rice to eat!" I asked them, "How is the silkworm season?" "We can only hope for the silkworms. But the recent climate has been cold and hot, which has greatly harmed the silkworms."

### Jiaxing Has No Surplus Grain, Yet People Come Here to Purchase It

I returned to the city under the moonlight. There was a lot of discussion in the city, all because the price of rice was constantly jumping upwards, already exceeding the 50,000 yuan mark, and people felt very uneasy. After the primary school teachers went on strike over "rice," the county government went on strike, and the teachers of the county middle school stopped teaching. The heads of nineteen townships requested to resign to the county government; they could not continue.

I interviewed Jiaxing's gentry, teachers, party leaders, county officials, lawyers, farmers, locals, etc. about this matter, and they all expressed fear about the rising price of rice. Why is the price of rice rising? The person in charge of the Rice Industry Association said: "The Hangzhou City established a Surplus Grain Purchasing Committee, but the people purchasing grain did not go to the provinces outside the province, but went to the Jiaxing area to buy. The Shanghai City established a Surplus Grain Purchasing Committee, and also specifically came to Jiaxing, which has no surplus grain, to buy. Jiaxing was originally self-sufficient, but because of the above two reasons, it has become worse and worse, reaching a state of serious panic."

Recently, the county government was ordered to collect military grain, giving a price of 24,000 yuan, which is 26,000 yuan different from the market price. The county government blamed the superiors for not stipulating a price difference, because after stipulating a price difference, the difference could be distributed to wealthy households, but if there was a similar regulation, I am afraid that when the apportionment reached the wealthy households, the wealthy households would pass it on to the poor farmers. Then what should we do?

### Three County Councils Meet to Petition the Provincial Government

The problem is that there is too little grain in the countryside, and it is not easy to buy even at high prices. How can we collect the 24,000 yuan from this area? It is said that this 24,000 yuan was

President Chiang stipulated on March 15th. At that time, the price of rice was less than 24,000 yuan, and the order did not arrive until May 10th, and the grain was required to be delivered by June 10th. The people expressed absolute support for President Chiang, but disagreed with the delay in the issuance of provincial orders. They also disagreed with the fact that the funds allocated by the Central Government were transferred to the provincial level, and the provincial level has not yet issued them. At present, Jiaxing needs to collect 18,000 piculs of grain, Jia Shan needs 15,000 piculs, and Pinghu needs 15,000 piculs, a total of 48,000 piculs. The county councils, county party departments, of Jiaxing, Jia Shan, and Pinghu will meet in Jiaxing on the 18th to petition the provincial government.

### Disaster Relief to the Countryside, The Common People Are Afraid When They See It

The county officials here said: "Now the county government's finances rely solely on slaughter taxes to maintain, and other tax revenues are negligible." Talking about county taxes, there are business license tax, usage license tax, slaughter tax, entertainment banquet tax, housing donation, etc. The central direct taxes include business tax, income tax, inheritance tax, stamp tax, profit tax, etc. The local people have many discussions about the collection methods of the direct tax bureau, because the direct tax bureau estimates the business of merchants, regardless of whether there are account books or not. The merchants said that business has been slack recently, but the direct tax bureau does not believe it. As a result of this disbelief, a tenant only pays 2,000 yuan in rent, but the donation tax paid exceeds 2,000 yuan. The government does not trust the people, so the people also suspect the government. When the government goes to the countryside to provide relief, the common people are afraid when they see it, and they have to ask the "teacher" before proceeding. Who is the "teacher"? It is the local tyrants, or the school teacher, or the gang leader in the countryside. It is said that when a military unit passed through the territory, they forcibly sold so-called "honorary cigarettes" to the people, and handed it over to the county government to apportion. The county government also transferred it down "as ordered." The people said: "How much money do we have to pay in the end? Just pay it all at once, don't bother us with bits and pieces."

### A Lot of Effort on Security, Still Feeling Many Difficulties

Now, the Youth Army stationed in the county has indeed gained a lot of praise. The general public has corrected many incorrect concepts because of the arrival of the Youth Army. Nanhuizhen, which is attached to Jiaxing, was looted not long ago, and the light machine gun of the Yingzhai Police Station was also taken away. Bus robberies often occur at 11 p.m. in Pinghu. The area of Jia Bei Xinmu and Wangjiangjing is a bit uneasy. The people of the county government said: "We really put a lot of effort into security, but we still feel many difficulties."

Difficult, really extremely difficult. It is encountering such unprecedented difficulties in Jiaxing, a paradise place. What is the reason for this? Some people say that this is a social problem, but who caused the social problem? Regarding the surplus troops, the Central Government had already ordered them to be sent back to their hometowns or to be paid to cultivate the land. Regarding the issue of donation tax, the Central Government and provincial levels had already ordered the abolition of all harsh taxes. Regarding the issue of military grain, the Central Government has already purchased it at a long price. I think the focus of the problem is on "unification" and "selfishness"!

### French Scientific Research Begins to Embark on the Road to Revival

— Translated by Hu Pinqing

If we recall the chaotic situation in France after the signing of the armistice agreement, we can easily understand the disordered state of French science at that time. In fact, since the declaration of war in 1939, scientific research in France had come to a standstill, as most researchers had successively gone to war, and the rest were engaged in research directly related to war and national defense.

Material Hardships

In terms of materials: some scientific instruments and materials were lost due to bombing, especially chemical products and raw materials for making instruments—metals and radio bulbs—were particularly scarce, and coal and electricity were becoming increasingly scarce. The reports of the Paris Academy of Sciences could not be published on time due to printing difficulties, and foreign scientific books and magazines could not be sent to Paris, so French scientists gradually became isolated from the outside world.

Lack of Talent

In addition to material difficulties, there was also a lack of scientific talent. Some scientists went to the front, were injured, or captured; some were ordered to go to North Africa, Britain, or the United States. Although some escaped to the non-occupied zone of southern France, they could not conduct research due to lack of materials. In addition, many scientists, such as Langevin and Labique, were captured.

German Devastation

The Germans tried to hinder the development of French science, so they occupied the School of Mines and Joliot's laboratory in the University of France, and closed the University of Paris, the University of Grenoble, and the University of Strasbourg. In addition, bombings and arrests greatly hindered research work.

Theories and Inventions

Finally, under the Vichy government, scientists were treated too poorly, so many researchers had to abandon cultural work in order to solve the problem of bread. Therefore, the number of French scientific talents gradually decreased. However, their confidence in the country was very strong, and their ideals remained unchanged.

In mathematics, Chang Ruo, Julia, Maro, etc., continued to research and publish papers. In theoretical physics, Madame Dolena studied universal gravitation. Miyula studied atoms, and Destouche studied basic principles. Regarding electromagnetism, Mariani had new theories and inventions.

In medicine, the most important was the Pasteur Institute. Although it lacked grain seeds and materials, it continued to supply medicines and blood serum.

All this proves that the French scientific community is still making continuous progress.

Two Types of Activities

In recent years, French scientific activities have mainly been divided into two types: (1) in-depth research on principles, and (2) training young scientists. Regarding the study of principles, the Institute of Mathematics, the Institute of Symbolic Logic, and the Institute of Theoretical Chemistry were established successively in 1941, 1942, and 1943. Regarding the training of young scientists, it involved providing captured scientists with various scientific books and magazines, and helping students who were secretly engaged in research work.

After the liberation of Paris, Joliot and Hautval, etc., began the work of innovating scientific research. Scientists already have an organization, and Joliot also proposed improving the material lives of the staff of the National Institute of Scientific Research and reorganizing the National Institute of Scientific Research. According to the new organization, there is a general management office above the institute, composed of fifteen scientists, and a council, composed of three hundred people. Whenever there is a special research topic, the general management office selects experts to form a specialized committee. French youths who had abandoned scientific research due to livelihood problems have now returned to resume their scientific careers, because they have been encouraged by the progress of foreign science. At the same time, they also know that the factors that determine a country's international status are the country's scientists and thinkers.

### The Mystery of the Central Plains

— Correspondance from Northern Henan, 18th, Fan Shidong

At that time, Germany's hope of the West, whether no war, or no job.

The mystery of the Central Plains was half revealed due to the trip of Xu, Zhou, and Zi, but there is still half that has not been revealed. Why did the Chinese Communists (CCP) make such a fuss and start this storm?

Li Xiannian Unifies the Communist Army

Establishes Six Regiments

The leader of the Communist army in the Central Plains is Li Xiannian, who is known to all. In the past, some people said that he was a carpenter by origin, but it has now been clarified that he is not a carpenter. When Wuhan retreated during the War of Resistance Against Japan, he brought forty or fifty cadres from Yan'an to Gouzhu and trained a teaching battalion with local communists. After that, he went south to contact Yang Xueqing, the Communist army leader in Hubei, unified the Central Plains Communist army, and established six regiments. After the New Fourth Army Incident, he became the commander of the Fifth Division of the New Fourth Army. From then on, he scurried back and forth between the Dabie Mountains, expanding his forces. After Li defeated the Fourth National Security Corps in Eastern Hubei and annexed the puppet Wang Boqing's troops, he became the 13th, 14th and 11th brigades, and there was an organization called the Hubei-Henan Border Security Command. It is said that Li Xiannian has the ability to command ten regiments in combat.

When the Northeast was in turmoil, Zhou Enlai suddenly fired a shot, saying that there would also be large-scale battles in the Central Plains. Mr. Xu Yongyu, Zhou Enlai, and Bai Lude personally went to Xuanhuadian to investigate the truth. Today, the Central Plains of China is not the outward development of the Communist army.

The Communist Army Moves Outward

National Army Increases Guard

After the enemy troops surrendered, Li Xiannian's troops not only controlled the Dahong and Tongbai Mountains, but also attacked near Xiangfan, which was between November and December of last year, and the momentum was very great. However, the defeat at Shuanggou was irretrievable, and as a result, they fled to the Guangshan and Zhushan areas east of the railway. If it were not for the order for a ceasefire agreement, Li's troops would have had no foothold in the Central Plains.

The Central Plains Communist army arrived at Luoshan and Guangshan, originally occupying only the southern corner. In order to rise again, they have invaded the southwest of Gaochang and Huangchuan since the ceasefire order. Taking Guangshan as an example, they originally occupied only four villages, but now they have occupied twelve villages, accounting for three-quarters of the area of ​​Guangshan. The National Army naturally took precautions against the Communist army's attempt to re-develop. According to Li Xiannian: there is no way for the outside situation in the Central Plains to allow him to develop, so he changed his mind and said that the Central Plains Communist army has no food to eat and asked to eat in northern Anhui. In fact, in that area, in the first stage, how much grain was eaten, and how much grain was sent to the people; in the second stage, 40 kilograms of grain per mu were sent to the people; in the third stage, how much grain the people had, and how much grain was taken. The market price of rice per dou in Guangshan is 3,000 yuan, and the Communist army once threw it out at 1,500 yuan per dou. Only God knows that the Communist army has no food to eat. Moreover, the government took a big hit and lent 200 million yuan to the Communist army to buy food. It is impossible to say that the Communist army has no food to eat, but they still want a way out, so they say that the National Army will have a large-scale offensive against the Communist army.

Each Soldier Receives Bullets

Preparing to Flee to Northern Anhui

More than half a month ago, each Communist soldier had already received two shirts and five pairs of straw sandals, and at the same time issued seventy or eighty bullets, preparing to go to northern Anhui; and one or two thousand of them had already disguised themselves as salt miners to their destination. Going from the Central Plains to northern Anhui may be the first step to the Northeast; and according to the Luoshan Agreement, neither side's troops are allowed to move. Therefore, the National Army had to take a serious attitude towards the Communist army's attempt and the destruction of the agreement. The Communist army referred to this when it said that there would be a large-scale civil war in the Central Plains. If the Communist army has superior military strength in the Central Plains today, it would have attacked many counties and plundered many lands, and another saying would have come out, at least nailing a "liberated" sign to the counties and cities they attacked. Communist Regiment Commander Escapes

Communist Regiment Commander Escapes

White Horse Sold Off

The Communist army in the Central Plains has its own internal difficulties. Several deserters come out every day. A few days ago, a regiment commander rode a white horse and escaped. The white horse was sold to the people for 50,000 yuan as capital for fleeing. But they were too embarrassed to tell the group as a reason to request to go to northern Anhui or the Northeast.

### The Tannu Uriankhai Problem

Dear Editor: The Outer Mongolia issue was addressed by Chairman Jiang in his speech at the joint meeting of the National Defense Supreme Committee and the Central Standing Committee on August 24th of last year, allowing its independence. Subsequently, on October 20th, Mongolian citizens voted, and a majority approved independence. On January 4th of this year, our National Government issued a notice recognizing the independence of Outer Mongolia. The matter of independence was thus determined. However, in addition to the four parts of Chechen Khan, Tusheet Khan, Sain Noyon Khan, and Zasagtu Khan, there were also two parts, Khovd and Tannu Uriankhai, in the old Mongolian territory of our country. When Outer Mongolia first became independent, Khovd was unwilling to join the autonomous organization and stubbornly defended Khovd City for more than a year. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, I acknowledged Khovd as an autonomous region, and the princes of Khovd sighed with caution when they heard of it. This situation was falsely reported to our government by Hong Zhen, the assistant officer stationed in Khovd. It is evident that even though they are both Mongols, they cannot agree because of different ethnic lineages. Tannu Uriankhai is north of Khovd, and the people are the Tuvan and Huhot tribes. The Tuvan tribe was unwilling to join the Outer Mongolian organization and established the Tannu Tuvan Republic. Our country was in a time of trouble and did not have time to inquire, which was a neglect. This time, when recognizing the independence of Outer Mongolia, how to deal with the Tannu Tuvan Republic was not mentioned, which inevitably became a question? Has this country automatically canceled its independence? Or merged into the Outer Mongolian Republic? Or has it not yet voted? It is impossible to speculate. Upon seeing the United Press London telegram from this newspaper on January 4th, according to the London Times, the Tannu Tuva Republic on the northern border of Outer Mongolia has been formally incorporated into the Soviet territory. Upon investigation, Tannu Tuva is the same translation as Tannu Tuvan. According to this, since this country has neither merged into the Outer Mongolian Republic nor canceled its independence, it should still be our country's territory, and a self-determined area for citizen voting. How can the Soviet Union arbitrarily take the lead and incorporate it into its territory? The territory of a country has the sovereignty of a country. Allowing it to be independent still requires citizen voting procedures. Since the Soviet Union is one of the United Nations and stands on the same front as our country, there is no reason to silently incorporate our territory into its territory without my consent. Upon receiving such news, our country should immediately lodge a serious protest with the Soviet Union. Why is it delayed for so long and silent? In this surging new trend, all lands that are customarily subordinate to others want to break free from their shackles and become independent. The independence of India, Vietnam, and the East Indies are all good examples. The entire Outer Mongolia has always been the complete territory of our country. How can we go against the trend of the world and lightly give it up? When the Outer Mongolian citizens voted, our government sent representatives to Mongolia to inspect. Khovd and Tannu Uriankhai were all voting districts and should be carefully inspected without exception. If this matter was not noticed beforehand and only inspected in Kulun and other places, it would be incomplete. This matter should be investigated thoroughly to make amends.

Upon investigation, Outer Mongolia's second independence occurred in the tenth year of the Republic of China; Tannu Tuvan's independence occurred in the eleventh year of the Republic of China. When our government received this news, it should have openly discussed and decided whether to recognize it or not. After making a decision, it should have notified all editorial agencies to factually include it in geography textbooks for primary and secondary schools, so that students know that the border issue is serious and know what to be vigilant about. It must not be kept strictly secret, so that the people of the whole country are unaware. When the author was editing the junior high school Chinese geography book for the World Book Bureau in the 22nd and 23rd years of the Republic of China, he fully included the two republics of Mongolia and Tannu Tuvan, and also selectively recorded the national conditions of the two countries. Because such things are usually public and not usually secret, the national territory has already changed, but the book still does not mention a word about the changed facts, so the geographical knowledge that students get is inevitably inaccurate. In recent years, when testing high school students, only one or two out of ten know that Mongolia has two republics. Not to mention junior high school and elementary school students. This is a neglect of the education sector. (In my opinion, even if the textbook does not record this matter, geography teachers should find ways to supplement it when teaching.)

When the Yalta Secret Agreement was announced, our country had no obligation to abide by this secret agreement. Its first article said: "The status of the Outer Mongolian Republic should remain unchanged." This article is in line with the purpose of the National Father to assist Outer Mongolia. Our government has automatically implemented it and decisively recognized its independence. On the surface, it seems to be fulfilling the secret agreement, but in reality it is irrelevant. However, this matter is formally unfavorable to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union helps other ethnic groups become independent, and secret agreements are required beforehand. One can know his attitude and benefit to this matter. Tannu Uriankhai is the territory of our country. The Soviet Union has not made a secret agreement with the United Nations, nor has it obtained our country's permission, but has arbitrarily included it in its territory and renamed it Tuva Province. I don't know which article of international public law it is based on. Taking and demanding without any scruples. If this matter can be recognized, there is nothing that cannot be recognized. After the matter was discovered by the newspaper, our government still did not express much, and each public group also did not send telegrams to question. It is probably because the Soviet Union has not officially announced it, and the situation in the East Nine Provinces is urgent, and the Tannu Uriankhai matter has become a secondary issue and there is no time to take care of it. Now that the disputes between the East Nine Provinces and the Soviet Union have come to an end, protests can also be filed based on British newspapers. If the Soviet Union is willing to establish full diplomatic relations after the protest, it will still uphold the principle of national self-determination and let the local people vote for a public decision. However, this area has been listening to the Soviet Union for a long time and has been deeply anesthetized. It must be recovered and managed for several years to correct its psychology before the vote can have the correct concept. If the Soviet side ignores it or delays in various ways, I should announce it to the world and let the arbiters of justice make a fair judgment. We must not endure in silence and create a suspension. All my people should always know that the country is important. Even an inch of land cannot be easily lost. All those who know that there is a party and do not know that there is a country, wake up quickly! You must know that the rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every citizen. China is now facing the most serious sun head and cannot repeat the opportunity to be a instrument for tigers and put the country in a position of eternal doom. Translation, 5, 25.

### Roosevelt's "Game"

— Huang Jiayin

The former President of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt, and the explorer William Beebe were good friends. According to William Beebe, when they were in the Shamo Mountains, they often played a "game". When they were talking late into the night, they would go to the meadow, look up at the sky and search for a small, half-bright, faint misty spot in the lower left corner of the "Pegasus" in the sky. Then one of them would recite astronomical words and say:

That is the spiral galaxy of Andromeda.

As big as our Milky Way.

This is one galaxy among hundreds of millions of galaxies.

There are a trillion suns in it, each bigger than our sun.

Then Roosevelt would grin at Beebe and say, "Now I think we're small enough! Let's go to sleep."

Self-boasting and arrogant humans can learn a lesson from Roosevelt's "game".

How long is life? Humans are originally tiny animals in the universe, so why should we spend all day struggling for power and profit?

Let us use this limited life to seek real benefits for the country, the people, society, and humanity!

Special Feature

### The Meadow Blocked by Ropes

— Qiang Xun

In the park, the four weeks of the large meadow were blocked by ropes, and several wooden signs with "Keep Out" were inserted. Tourists paced outside the meadow in a daze. A child came along, holding his grandmother's hand.

"Grandma, let's go to the meadow and roll around."

"No, didn't you see this sign?"

Although the child could not read, he understood the meaning of blocking the ropes. He pulled his grandmother to find a bench.

In the west corner, an armed comrade helped a lady cross over and walked into the meadow, looking around proudly. The expression was like the "privileged class" of the enemy puppet period, glaring at a group eating household rice blocked by the blockade line.

A small team of sailors in navy blue uniforms jumped over the barrier and comfortably sat on the grass.

The people outside the ropes were a little uneasy.

Over there, three Allied soldiers who did not know Chinese came. They looked at the ropes and then at the "uniformed comrades" on the meadow and unhesitatingly stepped over the ropes. They immediately chose a place, posed, and prepared to take pictures.

The children outside the ropes could no longer care about the "prohibition", and they swarmed through the ropes and surrounded the people taking pictures.

The tourists also crossed over the ropes and walked into the meadow, filling that "green emptiness" in an instant.

A man picked up a "Keep Out" wooden sign that had been pulled off and patrolled the meadow, looking around resentfully. Suddenly, a small leather ball flew over. He quickly picked it up and walked out proudly. An elementary school student chased after him and asked for the ball back.

"You can't kick a ball in the park!"

"I won't kick it next time, thank you for giving it back to me."

"No way."

"I'm sorry."

"If you nag again, I'll lock you up for three hours with the ball."

The elementary school student was speechless. He walked away in tears—three hours of freedom is more valuable than a ball.

The sun broke through the heavy clouds. A tourist who was playing hide-and-seek with his child took off his jacket and hung it on the nearby "Keep Out" wooden sign, and also put his hat on it. It looked like a scarecrow stuck in the field to scare sparrows.

### Bridge

— Wang Xingzhuang

Bridge,

Spanning from this shore to the other shore,

It uses a serious gaze, staring at the turbulent water, welcoming the future with a smiling mood.

Night, dawn, bit by bit,

Flowing past and returning around it,

It does not lament the vicissitudes of life,

It only knows that serving humanity is a must!

### Preventing Nearsightedness

— Hu Deling

I am a nearsighted person, and because of my nearsightedness, I suffer in many ways and feel deeply pained. I remember once when I went to visit a friend, he happened to be out. After waiting for a long time, because I had other important matters to attend to, I couldn't wait any longer and said goodbye to the person who received me. As I walked out of the door, not many steps away, someone was coming towards me from afar. I couldn't see clearly who it was, and I didn't dare to stop and greet them, fearing I would make a mistake and embarrass myself, so I just walked with my head down. But when I got closer, it was the very friend I was trying to visit. He said, "I was waving to you from far away, why didn't you acknowledge me?" His tone seemed accusatory. Afraid that he would be unhappy and misunderstand, I quickly apologized repeatedly, explaining that I was nearsighted, and he finally understood and forgave me. Such incidents are numerous. Visual impairment has a great impact and is deeply and significantly related to lifelong happiness.

The causes of nearsightedness are sometimes hereditary, but more often they are due to a lack of attention to eye hygiene and care in daily life after birth. Especially during school age, children are young and ignorant, unaware of the importance of eyesight, and don't know how to protect it. Parents also neglect to provide guidance, leading to nearsightedness. By the time they realize it, it's too late to regret, and they harbor resentment for the rest of their lives.

Since eyes are so important, parents today should pay attention to their children's eyesight and correct their poor reading posture for the sake of their children's eyes. Here are a few points that I can think of at the moment for your reference:

(1) Adequate Light – Eyes tire easily in places with insufficient light, and it is not suitable to read there. In strong sunlight, because of the intense exposure to ultraviolet and infrared rays, it is harmful to eyesight and should be avoided.

(2) Appropriate Distance – Light should come from the left. For close-range eye work such as reading or embroidery, a distance of one foot is most appropriate. Too close or too far is not suitable.

(3) Correct Posture – When reading, the head should be upright, and the book should be tilted, maintaining a 45-degree angle with the horizontal plane, so that the paper surface is perpendicular to the line of sight. Otherwise, it will harm the eyesight. Do not read books or newspapers while lying down.

(4) Eye Strain Regulation – If reading or doing close-range eye work for an hour, close your eyes and rest quietly for one or two minutes to adjust. Or look up and gaze at distant objects from time to time.

(5) For electric light bulbs, frosted white or sky blue bulbs are most appropriate. To avoid direct exposure to strong light and stimulating the eyeballs, it is best to have the indoor light reflected from the ceiling.

(6) Do not read or write when it is getting dark and there is insufficient light.

(7) Sometimes, if you use your eyes for too long, tears will flow out, indicating that you have used your eyes too much and your eyes are tired. You need to rest immediately. You should stop immediately, close your eyes and rest quietly, so that your eyesight will not be damaged. Otherwise, it will definitely be harmful.

(8) Promote physical health, get up early every day or stroll in the park, or walk in the fields, get close to nature, relax and enjoy yourself, benefit your mind and body, promote physical strength, and strengthen your eyesight.

I think that if you pay attention to the above points, whether you are a child or an adult, whether your eyes are nearsighted or not, if your eyesight is healthy, you will not become nearsighted; if you are already nearsighted and wear glasses with accurate prescription, your eyes will not worsen further.

### Effort as the Basis

— Shen Ying

In terms of personnel matters, there are too many things that people are currently dissatisfied with. However, being dissatisfied with others is passive, while being dissatisfied with oneself is active.

If we can humbly examine ourselves in this way, to see what defects we have and what areas we should improve, then I think it will be more beneficial than being "cynical and hating the world."

After this great war, how can we expect to step onto the broad road of prosperity in one stride? We should learn from the pain and improve society and revive the country. The responsibility lies on every citizen. Although this is not an easy task, it is not an impossible one. We must firmly remember our own position and start by working hard in our own role, first doing our part well. If the majority of people are doing well, then the shortcomings of the minority will naturally have no foothold.

Stop complaining about being dissatisfied with reality, because we are responsible for improving it. To improve reality, we must first examine ourselves. Don't forget that you yourself are an owner of the country.

Miscellaneous Thoughts

### Unsuited to the Place?

— Jiang Zhaoran

"Unsuited to the place" is a common phrase in officialdom.

To explain this phrase, it is best to use an analogy: Suppose someone is in charge of a certain county, but he knows nothing about the local customs, traditions, and history. Therefore, when he does things, it is often not very smooth, and may even provoke public resentment. But the county magistrate is essentially a good county magistrate. The supervisor of the county magistrate should transfer him to another county in the hope of smooth administration and harmony. This is the true meaning of the phrase "unsuited to the place."

But true meaning is true meaning, and facts are facts. Isn't that so? According to Jiangxi newspapers in March: The county magistrate of Xinyu County, Song Wei, the county magistrate of Zuochuan County, Zhou Che, the county magistrate of Lichuan County, Zhu Weihan, and the county magistrate of Chongren County, Que Lingyun, all owed more than 100,000 dan of grain. The people of each county sued them to the Director of Civil Affairs, Wang Cifu. However, Director Wang transferred them from County A to County B, and from County B to County C. The reason given was "unsuited to the place."

According to this, the ancient saying of "unsuited to the place" has been given a new meaning by the "times" and has simply become a "shield" for officials to collude in corruption!

This "shield" is truly beautiful and bright, and these officials are truly extremely clever!

But unfortunately: This "shield" is accumulated from the "dregs of the times." In the future, it will inevitably be destroyed by the "torrent of the times"; and the "torrent of the times" is beginning to surge. How long can this "shield" stand? This should be the concern of the officials!

### Cuckoo

— Huang Yihao

Cuckoo, cuckoo.

Having trod all over the country,

I have no place to rest.

Not a single grain of millet for me.

There is still the sound of killing in the world,

And ceaseless strife and plotting,

If the killing continues—

Ah! The end of the common people is near.

Busy, ah! The busyness of the killers.

No leisure, ah! No leisure to cuckoo,

Even though the shadow of famine has already appeared,

Appearing in every city area.

Eighty percent of the world,

Is crying out in material panic.

The self-destruction of mankind

—Is war, is famine.

Cuckoo, cuckoo,

Sow the grains of peace and auspiciousness!

You reap what you sow, ah!

There is no harvest without cultivation.

Even in the struggle for survival,

Sow the seeds of life.

Don't chase after a lifeless existence, ah!

Don't seek this meaningless lament.

Not a single grain of millet for me,

No place for me to rest,

Having trod all over the country,

Cuckoo, cuckoo.

### Fake DDT Should Be Reported

— Wen Bo

Recently, there have been many kinds of counterfeit American DDT sold on the streets. The newspaper (refer to the local news on the fourth version of the first page of this newspaper on May 24) has already exposed it. Now, I will list several ironclad proofs of counterfeiting, put forward by experienced experts, for your reference. I hope that the health authorities will pay attention to it and report it to avoid citizens being deceived and losing confidence in genuine DDT.

(1) Most of the fake DDT on the market is packaged in yellow beer bottles. In fact, American toxic drugs are packaged in green or blue bottles, and not in yellow bottles.

(2) American DDT is not packaged in twelve-ounce containers (at least sixteen ounces per "pint").

(3) American medicines emphasize instructions the most, but most of the DDT on the streets has no instructions.

(4) According to regulations, DDT is a toxic drug, and the label should have the word "Poison," but most of the DDT sold on the streets does not have it.

(5) American trademark law stipulates that packaging must not be the same, but the packaging of more than a dozen kinds of "American DDT" sold on the streets is not much different.

(6) American medicines pay great attention to brand names and names, but the English spelling on the labels of most of the beer brand DDT sold on the streets is wrong.

According to the inspection results of a certain expert, some so-called American DDT are almost entirely kerosene. In fact, twelve ounces of kerosene costs less than two hundred yuan, and a beer bottle costs less than one hundred yuan, but the selling price is as high as two thousand five hundred yuan. Deceiving citizens and shaking the confidence of ignorant citizens in science, these unscrupulous merchants are really hateful. We hope that the municipal authorities will investigate to the end and bring these people who use the name of fake science to cheat people out of money to justice, so as to deter others from following suit.

Science

### Scientific News

— Zhong Zuoqi

The Grumman Company on Long Island, USA, which produced naval combat aircraft during the war, is now manufacturing an aluminum boat weighing only thirty-eight pounds, which even an ordinary girl can lift over her head. This lightweight rowing boat is easy to carry.

The American people are now using vitamin-rich sunflower seeds as a raw material for baking bread.

Siemens Corporation of the United States recently manufactured an electric blanket that can maintain a constant temperature and has now produced more than 100,000 blankets. This blanket is connected to an electrical controller, and when the current is turned on, it gradually warms to the required temperature and remains constant regardless of whether the room temperature rises or falls.

The paratroopers of the United States can now rely on a small transmitter that allows them to continue talking to their aircraft after landing.

A new type of aircraft has appeared in the United Kingdom, with small wings in the front and large wings in the back. This type of aircraft has the characteristic of "being able to fly backward."

Education

### Thoughts on the Family

— Ying Yang

A long time ago, I read a short essay by an American university professor, "I Was Fired!"

He was an upright professor who took his teaching very seriously. As a result, most of the students in his class failed. The students made many contemptuous gestures, but he ignored them and didn't care.

A well-meaning professor advised him, "Grades are not gold, why not be lenient and do people a favor?" But he believed that he was not being stingy with grades, he just hoped that grades could accurately measure talent!

The principal summoned him to the office and said to him, "The students' parents are accusing you, their children did not come to school to suffer the torture of grades." Finally, he warned him, "Please consider the future of the school and be more lenient with grades!"

He did not do so, so he was fired.

Once, by chance, he went to visit one of his students' homes. He was surprised that such a wealthy family could be so crude and noisy. The radio was playing some unpleasant tunes. He lamented that without an atmosphere of Shakespearean drama or Mozart's music, how could one hope to train a Shakespeare or a Mozart?

So he no longer felt unfortunate about being fired.

I am now facing a similar test. I wonder why there are such similar environments. When I first stepped into the door, I heard the radio playing comedies and noisy musical segments. I felt like I was standing in front of a department store. When I was teaching, the sound of mahjong in the next room was stimulating my nerves.

Once, I saw my students fighting to read Shanghai-style tabloids. I was shocked. Some people lamented that yellow journalism was flowing into the hands of elementary school students, which is a serious problem. I think the police should more actively crack down on yellow journalism. At the time, I considered whether it was appropriate to dissuade them, and eventually another force compelled me to do so. Of course, I couldn't put on a stern face and lecture them. I tried to arouse their love of literature and forget about this matter.

A week passed, and I didn't see them reading similar books, but two weeks later, I saw them reading them again. Whose fault is this?

Is yellow journalism really more attractive? But everyone knows that yellow journalism has a bad stimulus for an immature youth.

There is not a parent who does not hope that their children will grow up and develop for the better, but the environment induces them to take the road to depravity.

"Without an atmosphere of Shakespearean drama or Mozart's music, how can one hope to train a Shakespeare or a Mozart?"
