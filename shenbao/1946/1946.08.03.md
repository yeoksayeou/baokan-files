### Marshal to Visit Lushan Again Today; Visited President Song Yesterday and Met with Yu Dawei; Focus of Discussions Shifts to the Anping Incident

[Our Nanjing Office, 2nd] Special Envoy Marshall will continue addressing issues concerning US troops in China today. At 10:00 AM, he met with three American military officers, departing at 10:40 AM. At 11:00 AM, Marshal Marshall traveled alone by car to visit President Song, holding a lengthy discussion and having lunch together. He didn't leave until 4:00 PM in the afternoon, and the content of their conversation is unknown. It is rumored that Marshal Marshall may fly to Guling with President Song tomorrow. Furthermore, at 6:00 PM this afternoon, Yu Dawei visited Marshall Marshall by appointment, leaving after a half-hour discussion. Marshal Marshall will depart for Guling tomorrow afternoon, and may invite Zhou Enlai for a meeting before leaving. However, there appears to be no progress in the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. According to a certain source, the Communist Party is refusing to concede, making negotiations impossible. Therefore, in order to reopen the doors to negotiation, new ideas are needed. Judging from the current situation, Marshal Marshall's meetings with various individuals over the past two days have focused less on Kuomintang-Communist negotiations, and have largely shifted to the "Anping" incident.

[Our Guling Office, 2nd] It is heard that Special Envoy Marshall will come to Lushan with President Song tomorrow. Also, Ambassador Stuart suffered from a cold last night upon returning to the embassy from the Chairman's headquarters due to the cold weather and felt unwell. Therefore, he remained in bed resting at noon. When Cooke visited, his medical officer indicated that the ambassador did not plan to return to Nanjing for three days.

[Central News Agency, Guling, 2nd] Ambassador Stuart continues on the 2nd to collect relevant information regarding the attack on the U.S. Marine Corps on the Pingjin Highway, hoping to quickly and thoroughly understand the truth. The ambassador is handling this matter with great effort to avoid being swayed by emotions and remains exceptionally calm. It is said that Marshal Marshall will come to Guling again from Nanjing within the next few days, which is related to the handling of this matter.

[Central News Agency, Guling, 2nd] U.S. Fleet Commander-in-Chief in China, Admiral Cooke, visited Chairman Chiang at his headquarters at 10:00 AM on the 2nd, making his first official visit after arriving in Guling. He left after forty minutes. He then visited Ambassador Stuart at his residence, discussing the attack on the U.S. Marine Corps on the Pingjin Highway for about half an hour. At noon, under the guidance of Chief Secretary Huang Renlin, he toured the Immortal Cave with his wife and children. After the tour, they went to the Lichi Society swimming pool in Hedong Road for swimming. At 8:30 PM, he and his family attended a tea party held by Chairman Chiang and his wife at the headquarters. Mrs. Marshall, National Government Propaganda Advisor Bell, and Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department were also invited to attend. The gathering ended at 10:00 PM.

### Chairman Has Political Solution for Domestic Disputes; Minister Peng Speaks to Reporters in Guling

[Central News Agency, Guling, 2nd] Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei and Advisor Bell visited Chairman Chiang at his headquarters at 8:00 PM on the 2nd.

[Another Dispatch] Peng Xuepei gave a brief speech at a banquet for reporters in Guling on the 2nd, stating that a car takes a maximum of only ten minutes to get from place to place, and an electric tram takes only three minutes, showing that Chinese affairs often take a little longer due to a lack of necessary conditions. Internal disputes in China must be resolved, and resolved quickly. No one is more anxious to resolve domestic disputes than the government, and no one is more anxious than Chairman Chiang, but it always takes a little time. Chairman Chiang has already resolved the problem of Chinese warlords and the problem of Japanese aggression. He will certainly be able to resolve the domestic disputes. I know he has a solution, and I know it is a political solution. He is a doctor who knows the habits and history of the patient, and we should give him some time. Today, Advisor Bell, Tao Xisheng, Lu Qixin, Zeng Hanguang, and *Life* magazine reporter Seale were invited. The hosts of the banquet were special correspondents from the Central News Agency and eighteen newspapers from Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Jiangxi.

### Military Mediation Department Group Departs Today to Investigate Attack on U.S. Troops; Gao Songyuan and Others' Inspection Concludes It Was a Premeditated Action

[Our Beiping Office, 2nd] (1) The 25th Group of the Military Mediation Department is scheduled to depart for Anping Town, Xianghe County, on the 3rd to investigate the attack on U.S. troops. The government representative is LÃ¼ Nengding, the Communist Party representative is Lei Renjiang, and the U.S. representative is Alexander. (2) Regarding the attack on U.S. troops in Anping Town, although the Communist army was responsible, the local authorities also bear responsibility. It is heard that the local authorities here will apologize to the U.S. military.

[Our Beiping Office, 2nd] Gao Songyuan, Deputy Chief of Staff of the 11th War Area, and Huang Rencai, Commissioner of the Fifth District of Hebei Province, were ordered by Director Li Zongren to inspect the sites of the attack on U.S. troops on the Pingjin Highway at Daxiaosha River. They returned at 3:00 PM on the 2nd. According to them, the inspection concluded that the action was planned. The authorities will report the findings of the investigation to Chairman Chiang. Gao and others departed at 6:00 PM on the 1st, first going to Matou Town, west of Daxiaosha River. Because the National Army had not yet advanced to Daxiaosha River, they stayed overnight in Matou Town. They only advanced with the army on the morning of the 2nd, staying in Daxiaosha River for two hours. They learned from local residents that the Communist army knew that the U.S. troops were passing through and originally intended to ambush them in Anping. However, after the villagers of Anping knelt and begged, they changed the location to Daxiaosha River, because the terrain there was suitable for ambush. They also detained two ox carts that were passing along the road and placed them across the road as obstacles. When the U.S. troops arrived, they suddenly opened fire, and the U.S. troops were caught off guard, resulting in casualties. Based on this account, it can be seen that the Communist army's actions were premeditated. According to eyewitness accounts from villagers, the Communist army suffered heavy casualties in the battle. In addition to more than 60 wounded and dead officers and soldiers being transported back to Xianghe City in large carts, dozens of people were buried locally. The command of the 11th War Area will issue a statement based on the findings of the investigation.

### U.S. Soldiers Killed in Attack Buried in Tianjin Yesterday; Mayor Zhang and Others Pay Condolences

[Associated Press, Beiping, 2nd] The U.S. Marine Corps authorities announced that another U.S. Marine Corps member who was attacked on Monday died this morning, bringing the total number of deaths to four. At the same time, it is confirmed that the National Government has decided to make two demands to the Communist representative of the Military Mediation Department in Beiping regarding the attack on U.S. troops: (1) All personnel who carried out the ambush on the U.S. Marine Corps must be handed over to the government for trial. (2) Compensation must be paid immediately to the families of the Marine Corps members who died. Reports indicate that the U.S. authorities have protested to the Communist Party regarding the attack.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 2nd] Three U.S. Marine Corps officers and soldiers who died in the attack by the Communist army near Anping on the Pingjin Highway were buried in the American Cemetery in Dongjuzi, Tianjin, on the 2nd. When the U.S. military held a memorial service, Tianjin Mayor Zhang Ting'e and the 94th Army Commander Mou Tingfang and others all went to pay their condolences.

### Communist Party to Continue Anti-American Movement in North China; *Liberation Daily* Publishes Absurd Theories Again

[United Press, Beiping, 2nd] The United States received a warning today that anti-American movements are expected to continue in North China, similar to the ambush of U.S. troops on July 29th and the kidnapping of seven U.S. soldiers half a month ago. The Communist Party has already acknowledged both incidents, but regarding the former incident, the Communist Party accused the U.S. military of attacking the "Eighth Route Army" alongside the National Army. At the same time, the U.S. military is still unwilling to officially confirm that the attackers of the U.S. military were Communist troops. It is also learned that Yan'an ordered the Communist army in North China to engage in conflict with the U.S. military and mobilized the people in the areas where U.S. troops were stationed to launch an anti-American movement, with the intention of creating accidents to force the U.S. military to withdraw from China.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 2nd] According to a dispatch from Yan'an, the Communist Party's official newspaper, *Liberation Daily*, published a commentary today on the attack on the U.S. Marine Corps, demanding that the U.S. military withdraw from China, considering this to be the "foundation" for resolving the current situation's disputes. The newspaper also stated: "We should also demand that the U.S. Marine Corps in Tianjin apologize, punish the responsible officers, and publicly guarantee that they will not attack or disturb the 'Liberated Areas.'"

### Communist Party Spokesman Claims the Current Situation Is Serious

[Our Nanjing Office, 2nd] Since the incident of the Communist army attacking U.S. troops in Anping, North China, all parties have been paying close attention. According to the Communist Party delegation, the Communist Party has obtained reports that (1) it has been confirmed that it was a U.S. armed patrol; (2) Anping belongs to the Liberated Area; (3) a "conflict" did occur between the two sides. Zhou Enlai has already instructed Ye Jianying by telegram to send a special team to investigate in order to determine responsibility. According to an observer, the incident may have been deliberately created, but it was done too clumsily, causing the current situation to become serious.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 2nd] Communist Party spokesman Wang Bingnan stated last night after Zhou Enlai and Marshall held a three-hour "extensive exchange of views": "The current moment is extremely important." He continued: Although the Marshall-Zhou meeting was of a general nature, it did not "specifically" consider the Anping incident involving the U.S. military. We have not yet received a report of the conflict, but we feel that this is an unpleasant incident. We have now suggested sending a special team to investigate. Regarding the question of whether Marshall brought back any concrete suggestions from Guling, Wang Bingnan replied: "There is no definite agreement yet. We are now waiting for Ambassador Stuart. It is too early to comment on whether Stuart will bring a compromise suggestion to stop the conflict and break the political negotiation deadlock." Wang Bingnan did not elaborate on the phrase "important moment," but said: "If all the problems can be resolved, China can achieve peace. If they cannot be resolved, the civil war will become more widespread and serious."

### Beiping Headquarters Spokesman Refutes Yan'an Broadcast

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 2nd] The spokesman for the Beiping Headquarters solemnly denied on the 2nd the news broadcast by Yan'an that 80 National Army soldiers attacked the Communist army on the morning of July 29th together with 60 U.S. Marine Corps soldiers. The spokesman stated that the broadcast was purely baseless slander and the most despicable and malicious propaganda.

They were accompanied by Counselor Liu Yingshi, who was sent by the Ministry of Education to Kunming to express condolences to the families of Wen Yiduo. Reporters interviewed Pan and Fei. Pan stated: "We are professors with an inclination toward education, so we are very reluctant to enter the political vortex. We do not wish to make any comments on the assassination of Li and Wen, only stating: We are willing to wait for the government to handle it." They will only stay in Nanjing for a few days before flying north to teach at Tsinghua University.

### National Army in Northern Jiangsu Approaches Haian; Communist Army from Shandong Reinforces Southward; Traffic on the Yangtian Highway to Be Restored Soon

[Our Nanjing Office, 2nd] Military News: On the front lines of northern Jiangsu, the war is dormant, but the Communist army is frequently dispatching troops, indicating that a large-scale military offensive will soon unfold in Yangzhou, Taizhou, Taixing, Rugao, and northeast of Suqian on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway. The Communist army is now transferring a large number of reinforcements from Shandong Province, crossing the Longhai Railway and arriving in Shuyang, preparing to attack Donghai to the north and Suqian to the south. Part of the reinforcements went directly to Huaiyin, landing near Qishui along the Grand Canal and heading towards Linze, advancing along the Linxing (Hua) Highway to Dongtai in an attempt to save the critical situation in Haian. A small number of Communist troops near the Yangtai Highway are attempting to make trouble, but the National Army is closely monitoring them. The traffic situation on the Tongru Highway is good. The National Army is repairing the Yangzhou-Yizheng Highway day and night. Communist troops near the Yangzhou-Tianchang Highway have been gradually cleared, and military trucks can now travel between Yangzhou and Tianchang. Overall, the situation in northern Jiangsu remains extremely chaotic. According to a military observer, the situation in northern Jiangsu is expected to be clarified within February, and the refugees in northern Jiangsu are already preparing to return to their hometowns.

[Our Jiangdu Office, 2nd] The National Army in Yangzhou launched an attack along the Yangtian Highway today, capturing strongholds such as Ganquan Mountain, Ganquanji, and Fangjiaxiang at 1:00 PM in the afternoon.

[Our Jiangdu Office, 2nd] The National Army advancing to the Jiangjiaba line of Licheng Town is now advancing slowly, and the remaining Communist troops on both sides are waiting to be cleared.

### Senator Wheeler Criticizes the State Department; Why Does the U.S. Support the CCP? It Is Truly Incomprehensible to the Chinese People

[Our New York Correspondent Mao Shuqing, 1st] Senator Wheeler of Nebraska issued a warning in the Senate today, stating: "The United States is lending huge sums to totalitarian countries such as Yugoslavia, while being unwilling to give to our ally China. The reasons for this are truly incomprehensible to the awakened Chinese people." Wheeler attacked the errors of American foreign policy, saying that the policy is sufficient to cause a third world war. He said: "The State Department's support for the Chinese Communist Party is directly beneficial to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has become a real threat to world peace and world security. We, under the leadership of American diplomats, are moving toward an atomic war." After pointing out the situation of the Soviet Union's invasion of Eastern Europe, Wheeler declared that the Yalta Agreement signed by Stalin and Roosevelt sold out the Chinese people to the Communist Party and sold out America's major interests in the Far East at the same time. Wheeler demanded that the Senate thoroughly investigate the Chinese issue, saying that the Soviet Union, under the protection of secret agreements, openly plundered the property of the Northeast, and China was divided into two as a result. Wheeler criticized: "President Truman seems to believe that the Communist Party's participation in the Chinese government can make it a so-called 'democratic' government, but we regard the Communist Party as totalitarian. Why is that?" Wheeler then compared the U.S. government and the Chinese government: "Why does the U.S. government advocate the Communist Party's participation in the Chinese government, while the Congressional Committees and the Department of Justice are doing their best to prevent the Communist Party from participating in the U.S. government? Why does Truman believe that the Chinese Communist Party is democratic and an agricultural reformer, while we regard the American Communist Party as loyal to a foreign government? Why doesn't Truman insist that the Communist Party should open up its occupied areas in order to restore traffic and save millions of starving people? Why is the amount of aid from the United Nations to China limited, while the aid given by the United States to Soviet satellite countries and even former enemy countries is so generous?"

### Cai Wenzhi Issues Statement; Communist Party's Goal Is to Force the U.S. Military to Withdraw, Then Launch a Full-Scale Civil War in North China

[Our Beiping Office, 2nd] Cai Wenzhi, the government counselor to the Military Mediation Department, issued a statement today regarding the attack on U.S. troops near Anping Town on July 29th, believing that the Communist army's action was intended to force the U.S. military to withdraw, and after the U.S. military withdrew, to launch a full-scale civil war in the provinces of North China. The main points of the original statement are as follows: (1) The Communist Party has admitted that the attack was carried out by the Communist army. (2) The Communist Party's statement that the U.S. military entered the Liberated Area and that the National Army accompanied them is purely a fabrication and a denial. The area is the Pingjin Highway. The U.S. military transports supplies every three days, and vehicles come and go. It is not the so-called Liberated Area. (3) The U.S. military regularly transports supplies from Tianjin to Beiping for the U.S. personnel of the Executive Headquarters and the Marine Corps stationed in Beiping. How can the National Army accompany them? The Communist army sneaked into the highway area, set up obstacles on the highway in advance, and arranged ambushes. This was premeditated. (4) The Communist Party said that the National Army was accompanying them that day. If so, the National Army should have been prepared. Why was the attack so sudden, with so many U.S. military casualties and no National Army casualties? What the Communist Party said is obviously a false accusation after killing someone. (5) Ten days after the U.S. military was kidnapped in Beidaihe, there was another attack on U.S. troops in Anping Town. This was obviously premeditated by the highest authorities of the Communist Party. (6) The U.S. military's stationing in China to assist prisoners of war does not infringe upon our sovereignty.

Regarding the talk given by the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, which was reported in Shanghai newspapers on August 1st, that food administration agencies had handed over food to foreign ships for transportation, the Ministry issued a statement in response, stating that the Ministry had sent a telegram to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company requesting them to investigate the matter on its behalf. A reply was received stating that the Nanchang ship was entrusted for transport by the Wenzhou-Taizhou Office, which is subordinate to the Zhejiang Land Tax Food Administration, and that the Niuzhuang ship was entrusted for transport by the former Shanghai Food Administration Commissioner's Office. The Ministry has not yet received reports on the delivery of the above two batches of food and therefore has no way of knowing.

### Chairman Chiang Cables Orders to Provincial and Municipal Governments: Must Complete Grain Collection on Schedule, This Decision Addresses National Economy and People's Livelihood

[Hankou Local News, 2nd] Chairman Chiang, regarding the collection of grain in lieu of land tax, recently sent a cable from Mount Lu ordering all provincial and municipal governments to begin collection as scheduled and complete it within the allotted time. The cable outlined the government's decision, stating first: "The acceptance of surrender and reconstruction work have been repeatedly disrupted, and the major military reorganization cannot be delayed. The current difficulties are increasingly severe, and the number of refugees is growing. The central government, considering the current situation, believes that during the reconstruction period, before the economy has returned to normal, it is still appropriate to collect physical grain in lieu of land tax. In order to improve local finances urgently, the financial revenue and expenditure system has already transferred most of the land tax revenue to the provincial and county levels in order to find solutions other than drastic measures to reduce the suffering of the people. This is truly an unavoidable measure addressing the current national economy and people's livelihood." The cable concludes by urging authorities in all provinces and municipalities to sincerely explain the situation to provincial and municipal councils and various local leaders, striving to cooperate and promote the completion of the task according to the plan.

### Tokyo Japanese Police Shoot Taiwanese Compatriots, Detailed Account of the Tragedy, Commander of the Occupation Forces in Japan Sends Personnel to Investigate, Li Bojun and Liao Jiwei Return Home to Release Report

[Local News] On July 19th, in front of the Shibuya Police Station in Tokyo, a tragedy occurred in which Japanese police shot and killed five Taiwanese residents and seriously injured eighteen. Li Bojun and Liao Jiwei of the Foreign Affairs Section of our Occupation Forces Headquarters in Japan were ordered to investigate and have clarified the causes and consequences of the incident. Li Bojun returned to Shanghai yesterday and, according to his released investigation report, the main points are as follows:

Previously, at 3 PM on July 14th, a Taiwanese resident, Zhang Yuxun, was walking along Shinbashi Street when he was suddenly attacked by Japanese thugs who stabbed him in the jaw with a short knife. He went to the Matsuda gang to demand the surrender of the perpetrators, but the gang refused. He then went to the Atago Police Station on the 15th to file the same complaint, but the police station also refused to accept it. Zhang returned home in anger. Around noon on July 16th, a group of about hundreds of Japanese thugs gathered in Shinbashi and attacked more than one hundred Taiwanese residents in open-air shops. When the Taiwanese residents saw the unfavorable situation, they rushed to the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association to ask the chairman to come and mediate. Chairman Ba Ligui, upon hearing the news, immediately went to Shinbashi to mediate on the spot. After Chairman Chen left, at about 3 PM, another group of about ten Japanese thugs, armed with Japanese swords, wooden sticks, and knives, rushed to the Taiwanese vendors to cause trouble. For self-defense, the Taiwanese residents disarmed the Japanese and resisted, resulting in injuries on both sides.

On July 17th, those involved in the case asked Chairman Chen to mediate and reported it to Lin Dingping, director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office. Director Lin then filed a protest with the Metropolitan Police Department, demanding compensation for damages, apologies for the desecration of the national flag, and guarantees that similar incidents would not occur in the future. The Metropolitan Police Department agreed to respond in three days. The Overseas Chinese Association knew that the Matsuda gang was intentionally instigating trouble because of the insult to the national flag, and the public was outraged. Therefore, they gathered at the Overseas Chinese Association at 4 PM on July 19th, intending to request the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office to find a peaceful and appropriate solution. Therefore, the gathering on that day was not a meeting to plan resistance. Moreover, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office feared that the Taiwanese residents were too agitated. In order to calm their angry emotions, Director Lin, at the request of Chairman Chen, went to the Association to advise the Taiwanese residents to disperse and return home, saying that they had suffered mental anguish due to the Shinbashi incident on the 16th. Some of the overseas Chinese dispersed upon hearing this, but a small portion still felt it was not enough and gathered together to petition the delegation. Major General Li Libo happened to be going out and, upon seeing the situation, gave the same advice as Director Lin to comfort the Taiwanese residents, and also knew that the police had a responsibility to maintain law and order. Furthermore, knowing that the Taiwanese residents had no intention of causing trouble, he publicly declared that the journey home would be safe and that no accidents would occur, and sent a jeep to escort them at the request of the Taiwanese residents, because the Taiwanese residents knew that the Japanese police and the Matsuda gang were colluding and were always wary. They did not expect the Japanese police to dare to stage a tragedy of shooting and killing Taiwanese residents. The Japanese authorities cannot shirk their responsibility for this.

After the overseas Chinese dispersed from the delegation, they took several trucks to return. About ten minutes after each car departed from the delegation, escorted by a jeep of the delegation, a Japanese policeman suddenly appeared in front of the Shibuya Police Station, and another three to four hundred Japanese people gathered in front of the police station. While the overseas Chinese were puzzled, a number of armed policemen arrived, including more than ten police officers, blocking the road and blowing whistles and firing warning shots, ordering the cars to stop. The Japanese police lined up on the roadside stopped the jeep, and at the same time, sounds of "Kill!" "Kill!" and "Fire!" "Fire!" were heard. Xie Wenhua, who was sitting in the jeep, shouted in Japanese, "Stop!" "Stop!" and said, "Why stop the car? Why point guns at us?" The Japanese police ignored him and insisted that they get out of the car. Another policeman held the car with one hand and made a gesture of pulling out a weapon, saying, "Japan still has extraterritorial rights over the United Nations." While they were threatening them, Police Chief Tsuchida of the Shibuya Police Station rushed over and was told by Zhou Xiangni, an overseas Chinese, that "These are overseas Chinese who are dispersing and returning home. They are being escorted by a jeep." The police chief then agreed to let them pass.

As soon as the wheels started to turn, sudden and intense gunshots rang out, like firecrackers. The majority of Taiwanese residents in the following vehicles, unarmed and defenseless, were hit and injured. When each vehicle successively returned to the delegation, one person was killed on the spot, and twelve injured were taken to St. Luke's Hospital by ambulance for treatment. The rest were sent to the Tonin Society and Hiroo Hospital for treatment.

From the occurrence of the incident on the 19th to the 26th, five people died due to serious injuries, and eighteen were slightly or seriously injured. The bullet marks on the jeep and trucks are evidenced by photos of the trucks. Furthermore, it was found that the fourth truck was ordered to stop by the Japanese police, and the driver, Fanjiang Li, was shot and killed on the spot. Because no one was driving the car, all twenty-eight people were arrested and are still being held in the police station. This is the account of the Japanese police shooting and killing Taiwanese residents in front of the Shibuya Police Station that night.

### Former Puppet Wuxi County Magistrate Takes Refuge in Taihu Lake, Reaches Tacit Agreement with Communist Troops, Jiangsu Provincial Security Department Strictly Orders Five Counties to Jointly Encircle and Suppress

[Suzhou Local News, 2nd] Yang Yanbin, the former puppet Wuxi county magistrate, became a bandit in Taihu Lake after the victory, and once called himself the Commander-in-Chief. According to reliable information, Wu Zhilong, the former enemy Wuxi Gendarmerie Captain, also led more than 500 of his remaining troops to join forces with Yang, calling for outlaws, totaling about 3,000 people. They have reached a tacit agreement with the foreign regiment of the Communist army and have established a stronghold on Pingtai Mountain in the lake, using the false banner of the "Jiangnan Democratic Allied Army," styling himself as commander and obtaining some American-style firearms. Their influence is growing daily. The Jiangsu Provincial Security Command has strictly ordered the five counties of Su, Xi, Wu, Zheng, and Wu to jointly encircle and suppress them starting in early August.

### Efforts for Peace Have Not Yet Succeeded, Communist Party Should Take Full Responsibility, Secretary-General Wu Gives Speech at the Capital Journalists Association

[Nanjing Central News Agency, 2nd] Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng was the first official to address the inaugural meeting of the Capital Journalists Association on the 1st. Mr. Wu analyzed the current situation in a somber tone, pointing out that the government does not evade responsibility for the unsuccessful completion of post-victory reconstruction work and the obstacles to national construction, which have caused the people to continue to suffer disasters and sacrifices, and will take responsibility to relieve the suffering of the people nationwide. Mr. Wu continued: Today's situation is neither war nor peace, neither unity nor disunity, neither solidarity nor lack thereof. The tangible and intangible losses suffered by the people are incalculable. Transportation has not been restored, production is stifled, and the Communist troops have not yet accepted government orders. The local governments established by the CCP in various regions have not implemented government laws and regulations, so military orders cannot be unified until now. The reason for this is that the government's various efforts in Chongqing this year have completely failed. The government convened the Political Consultative Conference, invited all parties and factions to participate in the government, convened the National Assembly, implemented the unified reorganization of the military, restored transportation, and stopped military conflicts, all of which have failed. Although we are reluctant to say it explicitly, we must point out that the Chinese Communist Party is constantly raising issues and creating disputes, thereby destroying the PCC resolutions and should bear full responsibility for undermining peace.

If the efforts made by both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party at the beginning of this year and the various plans drafted with the assistance of Special Envoy Marshall could have been implemented, then China's true peace, lasting peace, true unity, and lasting unity would have been achieved long ago. At that time, there would have been no need to fear that the government would use military force to eliminate the CCP, and there would have been no need to fear that the CCP would threaten the government with force. Now the whole country longs for peace, the Kuomintang longs for peace, and the Communist Party also wants peace, but peace cannot be achieved in the end, and the reason lies in this.

Taking the conflict in northern Jiangsu as an example, northern Jiangsu is occupied by its production [illegible], [illegible] safety, [illegible] the government's entire [illegible], the government asks it to be stationed elsewhere, not only is it unwilling to accept, but also makes a large-scale offensive, the national army is self [illegible], and has to resist, [illegible] no country, no government [illegible] allows the Communist Party to have a martial [illegible] force to threaten its [illegible] security, all domestic [illegible] causes, from this can be a explanation. Wu said in the end that although the current situation is like this, the government still has the determination to put the country first and solve all difficulties with all peaceful means.

### Local Correspondences, General Relief Administration Allocates Assistance for Equipment, To Revive Zhejiang Marine Fisheries

[This newspaper, Hangzhou Quick Report] The counties belonging to Yong, Tai, and Wen along the coast of Zhejiang Province are concentrated areas for fisheries, known as one of the three major fishing grounds in the country. The annual fish production reaches 60 million loads, which, based on the current value of 10,000 yuan per load, is worth a total of 100 billion yuan. It is indeed one of Zhejiang's important production industries, which is of great importance to people's livelihood. In recent years, due to rampant piracy during the resistance period, fish production has sharply declined, with only about 20 million loads per year. In order to implement the revival of fisheries, the provincial authorities established a Fisheries Bureau, appointing Rao Yongbi as the director, which is scheduled to be established in mid-August. This time, the province requested the General Relief Administration to assist with 14 fishing vessels, 2,000 wooden fishing boats with a load of 50 tons, so that they can set up their own factories for assembly, as well as various new-style equipment such as cold war machines, dry-making machines, and canning factories. After the General Relief Administration sent fisheries expert Li Xiangyuan to Ningbo to inspect the results, it was decided that it was necessary to set up a large-scale shipyard. The location is planned to be Dinghai or Ningbo. Now, Naspi, a fisheries expert from the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Group, has come to Hangzhou from Shanghai to meet with Shen and discuss the improvement of coastal fisheries production in Zhejiang Province. The Provincial Government recently sent [illegible] on a fast train to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 31st to jointly inspect the Zhoushan Islands and the coastal areas of the Wen region with American experts by special boat. The scheduled time is half a month, so that the findings of the inspection can be used to formulate a fisheries improvement plan to provide opinions for the government to adopt.

### American Aircraft Measures Climate, Drops Motor in He

[Jiashan Local Correspondence] On July 17th, in Xitang Northwest Village, a village in this county, a passing American plane dropped parachutes, etc. Feng Xushan, a farmer from Shao, found a small motor and a coil of wire in Hongmu Pond. The local police substation picked it up and sent it to the general office. The front of the machine reads "Wireless Motor," with English instructions next to it. "This machine is issued by the U.S. Government Weather Bureau from a height of twelve miles. It is dropped down. First, the balloon (a broken balloon like a larger light balloon sold in the market) bursts. Then, the machine descends slowly with the parachute (made of American crepe paper). When it descends, its function is like a radio broadcasting machine, and it is affected by the appropriate temperature and pressure in the air, sending out radio waves to report the climate. The machine is useless when it descends from the air to the ground." Inside there is a light bulb, an AB glass battery, wires and medicinal materials, and a spring steel skin under the seat. It is housed in a paper box. It is said that the machine was reported by the county government to the tenth district commissioner's office in Jiaxing and presented to the province. It is also reported that the same situation was found in Jin You County near Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province. Because people do not know the purpose of the object, there are many rumors.

On July 28th, taking advantage of the family's unpreparedness, she boarded the Hongli steamer alone, falsely claiming to go to Shanghai. When she reached the Luxu area, the old woman jumped into the river. The ship stopped and tried to salvage her, but she had already died when she was brought back on board, and there was no way to save her. The ship's accountant moved the body ashore temporarily and sent someone to inform the deceased's family to collect it.

Editorial

### The CCP's Anti-American Actions

A detachment of the U.S. Marine Corps patrol in China was ambushed by CCP troops near Anping on the Pingjin Highway while traveling from Tianjin to Beiping on the 29th of last month. Three or four American officers and soldiers were killed and thirteen to fifteen were injured. Since this incident occurred, all parties have considered it an "unfortunate incident." Special Envoy Marshall, who was in Kuling meeting with President Chiang, flew back to Nanjing in haste after hearing the news for rapid handling. As of this writing, Marshall has received a detailed report and has roughly informed CCP representative Zhou Enlai. Simultaneously, Ambassador Stuart was also discussing the matter with President Chiang in Kuling. In addition to expressing his concern, President Chiang ordered Li Zongren, Director of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, to conduct a thorough investigation. The truth of this "unfortunate incident" will soon come to light.

The CCP initially prevaricated about the case, attempting to shirk responsibility, even falsely claiming that there were no communist troops in the area, likely intending to shift the blame onto others. However, as the situation became clearer and they knew they could no longer conceal it, their representative Zhou Enlai stated that he had not yet received a report, but if such a thing had occurred, the CCP would take responsibility. At the same time, he claimed that for the past three weeks, U.S. Marines had repeatedly provoked communist troops in eastern Hebei, so the matter should be judged based on the attitude of the U.S. Marine Corps authorities, and the CCP had no intention of instigating conflict. They even hastily defended themselves, saying "this is definitely not the CCP's policy towards the United States." Little do they know that this kind of "burying one's head in the sand" propaganda is truly a case of "trying to hide what is already obvious."

At a time when Sino-American relations are becoming increasingly close, such an "unfortunate incident" seems unexpected to the general public, especially to the American people thousands of miles away. In fact, by revealing the inside story and exposing the CCP's conspiracies and tricks earlier, it would be easy to see how the CCP's anti-American offensive progressed from propaganda to action, and how it expanded its propaganda through action. We can also clearly see the role this "unfortunate incident" plays.

Our newspaper's editorial has long pointed out that the CCP is using two weapons: one is "anti-American" propaganda, and the other is the slogan of "opposing the civil war." Since the "July 7th Declaration" issued from Yan'an openly opposed the United States, it has reached the stage of revealing its true intentions. Therefore, the CCP's "anti-Americanism," progressing from propaganda to action, is an action carried out under orders and in coordination with the international situation. Only those with shallow views and short-sightedness would regard it as an unexpected event. We predict that if the U.S. government and people overemphasize this action and mistakenly believe that the presence of U.S. troops in China will cause trouble, then the CCP's actions of this kind may emerge endlessly. A Reuters dispatch from Beiping on the 2nd stated that the United States today received a warning, anticipating that anti-American movements in North China will continue to occur. This is exactly the situation we foresaw.

The relationship between China and the United States has always been extremely friendly. During the last war, the sons and daughters of the two countries fought shoulder to shoulder for many years, and the two countries have become war-tested friends who share the same fate. They not only hope to share peace and prosperity but also to work together to promote the progress of human civilization. After the end of the last war, the U.S. government, based on the above-mentioned lofty ideals, decided on its China policy, hoping that China would become a peaceful, democratic, unified, and strong country, and fulfill its responsibility of maintaining world peace in the United Nations. President Truman's declaration on China in December of last year was a reaffirmation of this policy. From then until today, the United States has used this as its guideline in both words and deeds, never crossing the line. The temporary presence of U.S. troops in China can not only help our country disarm Japanese troops and send them back home to complete our country's demobilization work, but it also has a significant benefit to the restoration of domestic peace in our country. The motivation of this U.S. policy towards China is entirely innocent and flawless. The U.S. government and public both believe that peace is indivisible, and if China, as a major power in the Far East, is in turmoil, then the United States cannot enjoy its peace and prosperity alone. The United States assisting China to achieve democratic unity and strength, and to maintain peace in the Far East, is not only for China but also for the United States, and therefore for the world and humanity. Therefore, all Chinese people, as well as peace-loving people with "human nature," will never intentionally undermine the U.S. policy towards China. Yet, there are now a few scoundrels with ulterior motives who spare no effort to "oppose the United States," and may even incite ignorant people to re-enact the "Boxer Rebellion" in North China, which truly makes us lament that these people are so unprogressive!

So why do they do this? To answer this question, one only needs to recall why Wang Jingwei, Chen Gongbo, and other traitors shouted "Greater East Asia" and sang "anti-British and anti-American" songs back then to understand half the story! Back then, Britain and the United States only recognized the Nationalist government led by President Chiang as the sole legitimate government, so Wang, Chen, and their fellow traitors had to "oppose Britain and the United States." Now, the United States still only recognizes the Nationalist government as the sole legitimate government and gives all assistance to the Nationalist government, so those who have a "tacit understanding" with Wang, Chen, and their ilk naturally regard the United States as an enemy and incite anti-Americanism. Mao Zedong was the first to issue anti-American remarks, demanding that the United States immediately cease its aid to China and withdraw its U.S. troops from China, even slandering U.S. aid to China as nothing less than creating internal strife, plunging China into chaos and poverty. Following this, the CCP's echo chambers, under their direction, clamored together, attempting to confuse the American people and thereby demanding that their government cease aid to China and withdraw its troops stationed in China. However, apart from a small number of people in the United States who, due to limited information, mistakenly believe that the domestic situation in China is chaotic and the future is bleak, and demand that the government change its policy, the majority of informed people have a clear understanding of the internal situation of Chinese politics, support the government's established policy, and will never be shaken by it. In particular, President Truman and Secretary of State Byrnes have faith and determination in China's future and earnestly hope that China will become a peaceful, strong, and unified country with 120,000 points of enthusiasm. The CCP, seeing that its orchestrated anti-American propaganda has not been effective, has gone a step further and used actions to threaten the United States, first by kidnapping U.S. soldiers, and then by ambushing U.S. patrols, all in order to achieve the "effect" of "withdrawing U.S. troops" on the stage through this "wonderful performance." Why do they want U.S. troops to withdraw from China at this time? To put it bluntly, it is because they want to be able to "create complete internal strife" and start a major fight without U.S. troops nearby. Therefore, the CCP's attack on U.S. troops this time was a planned action, and Zhou Enlai's statement that "this is definitely not the CCP's policy towards the United States" is akin to the humorous saying "there is no 300 taels of silver buried here, and the neighbor Ah Er did not steal it."

What attitude should the National Government adopt towards such anti-foreign cases, which are similar to the "Boxer Rebellion" on a large scale and similar to the "Lincheng train robbery" on a small scale? We believe it is very simple: the CCP fighting against the National Army can still be excused as "civil war," which may be tolerated. But now they harbor anti-foreign sentiments and act like bandits. There is no alternative but to resolutely suppress them, without compromise. Otherwise, "hesitation leads to chaos," beware, be careful!

### Conference Chairman Rotates Among Four Powers, Small Countries Firmly Oppose, No Result in Discussion of Voting Rights

[Our Newspaper] Paris, 2nd (Broadcast): The Conference Rules Committee met today to discuss three issues, which caused fierce debate, but no results were achieved and were postponed until tomorrow for further discussion. The three issues discussed are as follows: (1) Led by New Zealand, the small countries opposed the four major powers taking turns as chair of the conference. Molotov and Byrnes both believed that the small countries had no reason to object. No vote was taken and will be discussed again tomorrow. (2) The issue of majority and two-thirds voting was also discussed, but no results were achieved. (3) Poland requested a seat on the Committee on Treaties with Hungary, supported by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, but opposed by Britain and the United States.

### Poland Requests to Participate in Discussion of Hungarian Treaty, Withdraws Automatically Due to Opposition from U.S. Representative

[Our Newspaper] London, 2nd (Broadcast): During today's meeting of the Rules Committee, Byrnes had the first public dispute with Soviet Representative Molotov over Poland's request to attend the Committee on Treaties with Hungary. Byrnes rejected Poland's request, saying that the United States adhered to the decision of the four powers, only allowing countries that had fought with the Axis satellite states to have the right to speak on the treaties. To avoid a public conflict between Byrnes and Molotov, Poland finally withdrew its request.

### Differences Between Large and Small Countries Should Not Be Confrontational, Casting a Shadow on the Conference, Canadian Prime Minister King Delivers a Speech, Czech Representative Says Willing to Remain Loyal to the Allied Powers

[Our Newspaper] Paris (Broadcast): The Fifth Plenary Session of the Conference was held at 4:02 PM today (midnight in Shanghai). Czech delegation leader Masaryk delivered a speech, saying that the agreement on the rights of national minorities in Czechoslovakia was the same as before the war. Masaryk did not specify which minority, but everyone knew that he was referring to the Hungarian minority in Czechoslovakia. These Hungarians had special rights in accordance with the agreement after the First World War. During recent Czech-Hungarian talks, the Hungarian Foreign Minister requested the restoration of this agreement on special rights for national minorities. Masaryk went on to praise France and said that Czechoslovakia would always be loyal to the Allied Powers and was proud to be a Slavic country. Czech troops fought in Ukraine, participated in the Battle of Dunkirk, and fought alongside the troops of the great ally, the United States. Our Czech delegation will make suggestions at the conference. He also emphasized that Czechoslovakia never wanted to seek any revenge.

Masaryk delivered his speech in English, first expressing respect to France, and then saying that neighboring countries in the East and West hope to mutually guarantee their security for many years to come. We should recognize the situation in Central Europe and the deep reasons for the two world wars. We must understand the tragic failure of past methods and try to find new solutions. Czechoslovakia is willing to dedicate its loyalty to peace, progressive democracy, and its Allied countries.

[Our Newspaper] Paris, 2nd (Broadcast): In today's plenary session of the conference, following the Czech Foreign Minister, Canadian Prime Minister King spoke. King requested that the conference not make decisions on disputed parts of the treaty and requested the four powers to hold a foreign ministers' meeting at the same time to expedite the attainment of final peace. King emphasized that divisions must be reduced among all countries, which is the sincere desire of the participants and the world. King continued that geographically speaking, the status of Central Europe is not closely related to us, but we should not deny the fact that we participated in the war very early, because we immediately realized that world peace is a whole and cannot be divided. Our hope has not been achieved.

The purpose of this conference is not only to revise the draft treaty, but also to express respective opinions on certain issues in order to reach a general agreement. However, it is a pity that the conflict of interests between large and small countries has resulted in an unnecessary confrontation, which has cast a shadow on the true goal of the conference.

[United Press, London, 1st] Prime Minister Attlee flew back from Paris yesterday morning to attend a special cabinet meeting to discuss the Palestine issue. British Chief of Staff Montgomery also attended to provide advice. The surprise of British officials at President Truman's dissatisfaction with the Palestine partition plan proposed by British and American experts is obvious. Lord President of the Council Morrison declared that whether Britain accepts the Palestine partition plan depends on the attitude of the United States and hopes that the United States can provide support. Shortly thereafter, President Truman telegraphed the delegation in London to return home for consultations.

Roundtable Meeting to be Held This Month

Minister of Commerce Cripps spoke on behalf of the Cabinet, saying: Our ultimate goal is to complete the autonomy of the two major peoples of Palestine. Under the mandate, the British government has the responsibility to decide the future of Palestine and should not be determined by terrorism or riots. Cripps also said that the British government does not trust that a joint government composed of Jews and Arabs can be promoted under the current situation. However, dividing Palestine outright is too drastic and abrupt. The fairest way for us to treat the Arab and Jewish peoples equally is to implement large-scale autonomy in designated territories. Cripps also said:

Jewish Refugees Coming in Waves

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 1st] Reliable sources say that a fleet of ships fully loaded with Jewish refugees, about five ships, is sailing from the central Mediterranean towards Palestine.

### U.S. Air Force Day, Truman Delivers Speech

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] President Truman delivered a speech last night at a special banquet commemorating the 29th anniversary of the founding of the U.S. Air Force, strongly stating that the United States does not want to gain power, reparations, or territory as a result of victory. All that the United States needs is a just peace. He also said that the United States has a huge air force and army and navy, which is sufficient to maintain peace. The U.S. Air Force has made outstanding achievements in wartime and also has an important mission in peacetime. If our country wants peace, it must first have a guard force to maintain it.

### Forgiving the Giant Elephant, Challenging the Rat, Churchill Ridicules the Government

[Reuters, London, 1st] Lower House today Palestine Churchill said that the British government will prepare to put 400 million Indians in the terror of civil war. Any events that may occur in Palestine, compared with the state of India, is like the battle of the rat and the battle of the giant elephant. We are ready to transfer the independence of India to the hands of mutually hostile people. We have announced that we are ready to abandon the Indian continent and our achievements there for two hundred years. We have defended Egypt twice, but we are ready to abandon the important canal area, but for little Palestine, we hold the determination not to let go until death, even if it means fighting the Jews or the Arabs. It is truly puzzling. Perhaps the British government has had to retain a springboard in Palestine because it has already abandoned Egypt and the canal area. If so, we cannot avoid the charge of selfishness. I feel this is a major mistake that will greatly weaken our country's position.

### British-Indian Relations Precarious

[United Press, New York, 1st] Relations between India and Britain are unusually tense, and if a partial solution cannot be reached, another crisis will arise. The Muslim League has refused to participate in the Constituent Assembly, which will open in late August or early September, to formulate an independent constitution for India, and has declared that it will begin "direct action" to achieve the goal of partition and build a separate Muslim state. Muslim leaders have called for a one-day closure on August 16 and a cessation of all non-political activities. It is expected that Muslim League leaders will explain the purpose of their "direct action" in detail on that day.

### U.S. Has New Weapon to Deal with Atomic Bomb Airplanes

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 2nd (Broadcast): U.S. Army ordnance experts are studying a radio-controlled bomb with high destructive power that can explode in the formation of invading enemy bombers. The Army is unwilling to disclose the details of the bomb, but it is clearly intended to counter large formations of bombers carrying atomic bombs. This bomb is quite powerful, and when it explodes in the center of the bomber formation, it can cause the enemy aircraft formation to scatter or fly alone.

### Truman Signs Bill Establishing Civilian-Run Atomic Energy Commission

First Batch of Peacetime Products

[Washington, 1st] President Truman has signed a bill establishing the Atomic Energy Control Commission, all of whose members are selected from civilian life. Four military technical experts will also cooperate with the commission. The development of military uses of atomic energy will be discussed with one of the four officers.

[Our Newspaper] London, 2nd (Broadcast): General Blandy issued a statement today predicting that after 1950, atomic energy will be used to propel ships, and later it will be used in aircraft.

[United Press, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, 2nd] The first batch of peacetime products from the government's large-scale atomic bomb program was handed over to research institutions today for research on cancer and other human ailments. The first batch of products consists of five pea-sized units of radioactive carbon, called "Carbon-14" (the weight of ordinary atomic carbon is 12). Each unit weighs 10/1000ths of an ounce and is worth $400, including manufacturing and shipping costs.

### Celebrating American Independence Day in President Truman's Hometown (Part 1): Listening to an Old Overseas Chinese Man Talk About the Past and Present

â (Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in the United States, Mao Shuqing)

[Kansas City, July 10th, Airmail] On July 4th, American Independence Day, every household in Kansas City flew the American flag, and the streets were as quiet as if not a single bird chirped. People were enjoying their holiday. At 10:30 in the morning, Mr. He Liyuan, an old overseas Chinese man, drove to the Phillips Hotel. This seventy-year-old man was as energetic as a young man in his thirties. Hardly any Chinese students in the United States, especially those who came in the early days, did not know him. He was so diligent, humble, and friendly. He patted me on the shoulder and told me, "Mr. Mao, you probably weren't even born when I came to America!" He also said that when Mr. Xian Guang was studying at the University of Missouri, he was an old friend of his. Now in America, he still cares about Mr. Xian Guangâs son and son-in-law at all times. He could remember many students who studied in Missouri or Kansas. He never admitted he was old; he felt he was still young. This old overseas Chinese man was a "traditional Chinese medicine doctor" from Guandong. He had been to Shanghai twice in his early years. He has been in America for more than thirty years. Because he lived in Kansas City, he had a twenty-five-year friendship with the current master of the White House, President Truman. Even now, they still correspond frequently. He saw Truman working on the farm in his youth. He knew Truman's mother and brother, and he had a very close relationship with Truman's two nephews, who are now young men serving as a Navy Lieutenant Commander and an Army Captain.

Truman's Birthplace

Greenway Village, which is also where He Liyuan farmed in his early years. Greenway Village is thirteen miles from Kansas City. Consul Shen Zuogan and I sat in Elder He's car. The three of us drove along the main road. The countless villages outside Kansas City resembled the Yangtze River basin in China, with endless fields and orchards. Greenway Village is in the northeast of the city. The area of the entire village seems to be larger than the entire Kansas City. There are many large lawns in the village, which are golf courses. Many young Americans were playing golf to enjoy their national holiday. One manor after another, separated by seven or eight hundred meters, are remotely connected. Many of the manor owners are Jewish. The Jewish people accumulated money and bought land in the United States. They were bought in at very low prices back then, and now they have increased several times. In the middle of the village, there is a 140-acre manor with a "for sale" sign hanging on it. Inside there are fish ponds, lawns, farmland, hillsides, and countless large forests of trees. It is said that the "seller only wants 26,000 dollars." He said this was a very cost-effective deal. This manor for sale is not far from Greenway town. At the corner of the town is Mrs. Truman's residence.

It is a very small white wooden house, two stories high, with a small lawn outside. Outside the lawn is a newly built wire fence. I guess this is probably the only decoration Truman provided for his old mother after he "became successful." Truman's mother often lives here. That day we originally wanted to go and see "Mrs. Truman" by the way, but unfortunately, she was out, and the short door in the wire fence was locked with a large lock. Truman's father died early, and in his childhood, he lived a farming life here with his mother. His mother had four hundred acres of farmland. Because she did not have the money to pay the land tax, it was almost auctioned off and confiscated several times. The villagers called Truman the "cowherd." Truman's economic situation was quite miserable in his youth. Truman's mother was a frugal woman. She raised chickens and pigs, relying on meager income to maintain the family's economic life. President Truman and President Lincoln had the same poor origins, but their economic backgrounds in their youth were different. Lincoln was a self-reliant wandering youth, while Truman was a typical pastoral figure.

The characteristics of an agricultural society are stability and conservatism, which is obviously different from the cultivation of Lincoln's "great talent and strategy." Truman later went to the city to work as a shop clerk, studied law, and even became a judge of the state and county, and he was always known for his prudence and stability. He Liyuan, an old overseas Chinese man, still has a license to practice traditional Chinese medicine issued in 1930, which was issued when Truman was a state and county judge. However, the signature style of the word "Truman" is different from what it is now. From state and county judge to federal senator, he benefited from the "promotion" of one person. This person was the former mayor of Kansas City, Pendergast. Pendergast's prestige back then was the same as that of Chicago Mayor Kelly today. He was known as the "iron fist" behind the Democratic Party. The citizens of Kansas City also called him the "Pendergast machine," just like Chicago. In the United States, when someone is called a "machine" by a certain group, the meaning is both good and bad. "Machine" means that he has social power, prestige, manipulates local affairs, and is also the backstage of a national political party. But on the other hand, machine also implies that he monopolizes "prostitution, gambling, and drinking" and profits from it. But Pendergast finally fell out of luck. The reason was a report from within the Democratic Party. The person who reported Pendergast was the current speaker of the Kansas City Senate, Daly, who is also a powerful figure in the Democratic Party and an old friend of He Liyuan. He accused Pendergast of concealing "income tax," which in the United States, especially in the United States during the war, is regarded as extraordinary. The "lawsuit" at the time went to the Supreme Court in Washington. In the end, he was found guilty. Because of health problems, the court granted a "suspended sentence." During the suspension, this "benefactor" of Truman died of depression in Kansas City last year. Truman did not become rich because he became president. He Liyuan, an old overseas Chinese man, can determine this from Truman's family situation, because Elder He knows their family and knows that Truman had "deficits" every year during his tenure as a senator and had to ask the He family for subsidies. After 1930, Truman's younger brother still "farmed diligently" on the farm in Greenway Village, but gradually became rich due to the rising prices of agricultural products. Now, Truman's younger brother is the owner of a 700-acre farm in Greenway Village. Because it was a holiday, we did not meet this "agriculture-oriented" president's younger brother, but we carefully observed his farming. There were winter melons, potatoes, tomatoes, vegetables, and also rice and wheat. Truman's two nephews also have a new white house built on the side of the farm. They have all gone to war as officers. Elder He said, "They are in England."

Ordered to Economize on Expenses

[Washington, 1st] Truman, Chief of Staff of the Army, Eisenhower, Nimitz's protest. The Navy must save expenses. The Naval Bureau has also received the same order, and seven new-style mail ships will inevitably be stopped from construction. The United States has no large mail ships other than those converted from troop transports. Truman also issued an order to the heads of various agencies, stating that in order to avoid inflation and reduce public debt, all agencies must reduce expenditures to the minimum.

### The United States Requests the Far Eastern Commission to Revise the Japanese Reparations Plan

[United Press, Washington, 1st] It was learned today that the United States has requested the Far Eastern Commission to completely abolish the previously drafted Japanese reparations plan and redraft it based on the new American proposal. The proposal was submitted last week and is currently under review by the commission. It is understood that the proposal suggests establishing another institution under the Far Eastern Commission, which would report to the Far Eastern Commission. However, all staff should devote their full time to drafting the reparations plan. The institution will continue to hold meetings to reach an appropriate decision based on the German reparations plan of the Paris Peace Conference. The Paris Peace Conference has decided on the allocation amounts for the countries that fought against Germany, stipulated the division of German assets at home and abroad, and decided how the Allied countries should obtain these assets. The United States is dissatisfied with the work of the State Department and the Pauley Reparations Mission in the Far Eastern Commission, so it has proposed this plan to improve it.

### Malignant Inflation: Japanese Banknote Issuance Exceeds 50 Billion Yen

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 2nd] The amount of Japanese banknotes issued has exceeded the 50 billion yen mark. As of the end of July, the total amount of banknotes issued was 49.73 billion yen. Yesterday, due to withdrawals for living expenses, etc., approximately 300 million yen was re-issued. The amount of Japanese banknotes inflated in July totaled 6.972 billion yen, an average daily increase of 25.8 million yen.

### Far Eastern International Tribunal: Witnesses Maintain Consistent Style, Blaming the Kwantung Army for the Northeast Incident, Attempting to Exonerate the Japanese Government

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 2nd] The Far Eastern International Tribunal continued to summon Mamoru Shigemitsu, former ambassador to Portugal, to testify today. According to the witnesses summoned by the Far Eastern Tribunal, from former Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Takayoshi Tanaka to Shigemitsu, their testimonies have been consistent, maintaining a consistent style, that is, attributing the outbreak of the Northeast Incident to the ideas and actions of some officers of the Kwantung Army and other individuals, attempting to exonerate the Japanese government and further avoid involving the Japanese Emperor.

[United Press, Tokyo, 2nd] The Far Eastern International Tribunal continued to try Japanese war criminals today. The prosecutor's witness, Mamoru Shigemitsu, who was the consul-general in Shenyang in 1931, testified that the Kwantung Army should be held responsible for the bombing of Zhang Zuolin in Huanggu Tun. Prime Minister Tanaka had planned to interrogate the instigators behind the case, but was opposed by Japanese military personnel, and the Tanaka cabinet resigned as a result. Tanaka's policy towards Manchuria seemed to be based on maintaining order in Manchuria, protecting the Japanese and their legitimate interests in Manchuria and mainland China, not interfering in China's internal affairs, and supporting the open-door policy. However, the Tanaka cabinet's policy towards Manchuria was more active than that of its predecessor.

### Shigemitsu's Absurd Remarks Refuted by the Presiding Judge

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd Dispatch] Mamoru Shigemitsu, the former Japanese consul-general in Shenyang, under severe cross-examination by the International Tribunal this morning, turned to testify in favor of the defendants, saying that in view of the revolutionary crisis facing the troops under Chiang Kai-shek at the time, the Kwantung Army had no choice but to take action to protect the lives and property of Japanese people in Northeast China. He also claimed that after Zhang Zuolin was murdered, a fierce anti-Japanese movement formed in Northeast China. Shigemitsu believed that this was due to Zhang Xueliang's inclination towards the Kuomintang and Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People (infiltrating) into Northeast China. When Shigemitsu attributed the Kwantung Army's use of force in Northeast China to the high level of anti-Japanese sentiment in the area, Judge Webb interrupted him and reprimanded him, saying: "Mere speculation has no value as testimony."

### Iranian Prime Minister Sadanah Forms New Cabinet

Still Holds Three Positions, Equal Balance of Power Between Two Factions

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 1st] Iran's new cabinet has been formed, and the leftist Tudeh Party has also joined the government for the first time. According to the public announcement, Sadanah remains Prime Minister and Minister of Interior and Foreign Affairs. Tudeh Party members obtained three ministries, namely Ghassem Ghevari as Minister of Education, Eskandari as Minister of Industry and Commerce, and Yazdi as Minister of Health. In addition, government spokesperson Prince Firouz, Minister of Social Propaganda Tamaddon, and Army Chief Ahmadi have not been transferred. Former Minister of Finance Hakimi has rejoined. According to observers here, Iran's new cabinet is an equal distribution of power between the "pro-Russian faction" and the "pro-British faction."

### Soviet Union Executes Traitors

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 2nd] Soviet traitor General Vlasov and his eleven subordinates, who organized a Soviet auxiliary team during the war to help the German army fight, committed heinous crimes. After being sentenced to death by the court, they were executed by firing squad today.

### Sketches of the Nuremberg Tribunal: The Fat Goering is the Most Dignified One; Crowds of Spectators Gather Outside the Fence

[United Press, Nuremberg, 1st] The 22 Nazi war criminals on trial at the Nuremberg Tribunal have become the biggest tourist attraction in Germany. During each recess, spectators crowded outside the fence, wanting to see the faces of the criminals. Some shouted: "Look at Hess! Look at Streicher! He's eating bread!" Some spectators stared at them with binoculars, which particularly annoyed the prisoners. The gaunt and red-headed former Chief of the German General Staff, Jodl, was furious. Sometimes he circled his hands around his eyes, as if holding a pair of binoculars, to look back at the annoying spectators, muttering scoldings in German. This trick often caused laughter, which made Jodl even more angry. This group of Nazi leaders, who committed heinous crimes, have mostly lost their arrogance due to their long-term imprisonment. When German lawyers presented their final defenses, they were either stunned or looked around the court listlessly. Eight months of long-winded speeches have exhausted the entire court, and the climax of the trial felt dull instead. Only during recess did the defendants recover from their semi-coma, exchange notes, and make slight jokes. Goering still appeared to be the most dignified and imposing. He was most respected by the court because he did not hide anything and continued to be loyal to the deceased Hitler. Americans like loyal people. He suffers from sciatica. According to court officials: "He lost interest after his attempt to make Hitler a legendary figure failed. When German lawyers slandered Hitler, Goering buried his face in his hands and shook his head slightly.

### Hungary Issues New Currency

[Reuters, Budapest, 1st] The Hungarian government issued a new currency today, named the Forint. Each Forint is worth 400 million million Pengo in the old currency. The Hungarian government has calculated the cost of living based on the new currency and set price limits for daily necessities.

### International Tidbits

Conflicts between new and old ideas within the Japanese Yoshida cabinet have caused cracks. There are signs of a partial cabinet reshuffle, especially the resignation of Minister A. Wada, which will be realized in the short term.

A Norwegian delegation arrived in Moscow on the 2nd to discuss the final border issue with Soviet authorities.

Negotiations between France and the Viet Minh delegation have been temporarily suspended due to the failure to reach an agreement on the issue of autonomy for Cochinchina.

### Zhang Zhiben Convenes Trade Associations, Soliciting Opinions on Investigation and Acceptance, Representatives Speak Up, Secret Documents Submitted on the Spot, Cheng Zhonghang Expresses Regret, Determined to Get to the Bottom of the Matter

Zhang Zhiben, head of the Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Assets Reception and Handling Work Investigation Team, and committee members Cheng Zhonghang, Fan Zhengbo, Zhang Qingzhen, and Wu Ji, convened a discussion meeting at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce hall at 3:00 PM yesterday, inviting opinions from various trade associations in the city regarding the investigation and acceptance work. Present were Xu Ji, chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, directors and supervisors Jin Runku, Wang Lai, and Lu Yinggeng, as well as representatives from 98 trade associations, including Luo Beichen, Pan Shihao, Wang Zhaocheng, Zhu Jianping, Ding Xiong Zhao, Zhou Jiasheng, and Xi Hanying, totaling over 120 people. Xu Ji first introduced Team Leader Zhang and the four committee members, Cheng, Fan, Zhang, and Wu, to the trade association representatives. The entire assembly applauded in unison to welcome them.

Zhang Zhiben's Address

Team Leader Zhang Zhiben was then invited to give an address, stating: "I am deeply gratified by the enthusiastic participation of representatives from various trade associations in today's discussion meeting, which fully demonstrates cooperation with our team. I would like to express my gratitude to everyone. We know that if the reception work had been done thoroughly, and everything was reasonable and legal, there would be no need for an investigation. The establishment of our country stems from the fact that many things in the past did not meet the expectations of the people. We are a democratic country, and the government and the people should cooperate, and the people should help each other. At the beginning of the reception work, the receiving personnel failed to cooperate closely with the people, which created a divide. Today, our team has come to Shanghai, and we still need to cooperate with the people to achieve results. I remember that when the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce held a meeting in 1922, everyone held the attitude of 'merchants speaking as merchants, educators speaking as educators.' This was a great mistake. As political scientists tell us, 'Humans are political animals.' Living in today's world, we should all humbly study and sincerely criticize all political issues that concern us. For example, after the war, everyone hoped that domestic order would be stabilized and production would be restored as soon as possible, but under today's domestic turmoil, it is naturally difficult to achieve safety. Secondly, the main mission of our team is to investigate and report the situation of the reception work to the central government. However, our funding and manpower are not enough, and we must obtain your assistance to carry out our work. Because trade associations have a better understanding of the details of the reception work, they can definitely provide us with many clues, allowing us to investigate in this way, so that we will not fail your enthusiastic hope for us to 'judge fairly.' Although the duration of our work in this country is relatively short, we will definitely handle all issues in the fastest and most economical way. Now, I hope everyone will express their opinions as much as possible."

Cheng Zhonghang's Address

Subsequently, Committee Member Cheng Zhonghang gave an address, first explaining that the purpose of convening the discussion meeting was to hear from the representatives of various trade associations. He then supplemented Team Leader Zhang's remarks, stating: "The reception work has been in turmoil from last year until now, causing a stir both domestically and abroad. This is truly a disgrace. The responsibility to wash away this disgrace rests first with the government, and also with the people. There has always been a kind of morbidity in our society's atmosphere, which is that everyone likes to criticize behind their backs regarding any matter, but is unwilling to report it directly. This is an irresponsible manifestation. The lack of progress in Chinese politics over the years may have been rooted in this morbidity. Today, we ask business leaders to speak frankly and without reservation about the mistakes in the reception work, and fully demonstrate a responsible spirit. Our team sincerely and attentively accepts your opinions, and hopes to cooperate with you. Shanghai is an extremely complex city, and the problems that have arisen in the reception work must be numerous. Our team has been sent to this place to conduct investigation work, and based on our estimated funding and manpower, we feel that it is not enough. How can we not fail our mission and make the investigation work have some effect? It really depends on your assistance. In other words, our strength is your strength, and our achievements are your achievements. I hope that everyone can demonstrate their due civic responsibility today, provide us with many clues, and work together to complete our mission." After Mr. Cheng's address, representatives from various trade associations successively expressed their opinions.

Vegetable Oil

The representative of the Vegetable Oil Trade Association put forward five appeals: (1) The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau does not accept requests from civil organizations, does not show sympathy for the suffering of the people, and delays returning privately owned property, causing significant losses to the people. (2) Received warehouse materials are neglected and mishandled, and countless items have rotted and been damaged. (3) The materials stored in the enemy warehouses that have been taken over cannot be allocated for use by the people. (4) The enemy and puppet factories that have been taken over cannot be quickly restored to work, and are only sold for profit, which has a significant impact on the future of economic construction. (5) The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau has never approached public organizations, and its style should be changed.

Cotton Cloth

The representative of the Cotton Cloth Trade Association believed that the investigation work must (1) ascertain the facts, and (2) call attention. He explained that during the 1943 period, the dyeing and weaving industry, the cotton cloth industry, and the yarn industry had over 100,000 bales of yarn and over 6 million bolts of cloth forcibly seized by the enemy and puppets. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the puppet Merchants Association had over 2 million bolts of cotton cloth and over 10,000 bales of yarn in storage. The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau should have returned them after taking them over. At that time, our association and others submitted a request, but the bureau claimed (1) that it was impossible to verify, and (2) that the compensation was generous, and refused to return them.

Cotton Yarn

The representative of the Commercial Trade Association pointed out: (1) During the period when the enemy and puppets controlled Shanghai, our industry suffered a loss of 350 billion due to exploitation, but the government did not return the enemy and puppet yarn after taking it over. (2) The Ministry of Economic Affairs purchased cotton yarn without showing any sympathy for the difficulties of the merchants, and completely adopted coercive measures.

Steamships

Li Yunliang, representative of the Steamship Association, stated: Before the war, there were 500,000 tons of domestic steamships, of which over 300,000 tons were sacrificed due to the Anti-Japanese War. Most of them were sunk in the Jiangyin and Madang area under the government's order for blockade purposes. The government issued receipts and, according to the Military Conscription Law, should compensate for the loss. The shipping industry has repeatedly requested the government, and the Executive Yuan has approved the compensation, but it has not yet been implemented. The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau took over ships from enemy and puppet organizations such as the East Asia Shipping Construction Association, the China Steamship Company, the Shanghai Inland River Steamship Company, and the Central China Steamboat Association, totaling about 300,000 tons, which were all taken over by the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and not allocated to private companies. More than 30 motorized junks approved for lease by the Ministry of Communications were leased and operated by the Civil Aviation Motorized Junk Joint Operations Office, organized by all shipping companies, to transport relief supplies and government materials, and to maintain the livelihood of some unemployed employees. Now, the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau has suddenly put them up for sale, causing the Motorized Junk Joint Operations Office, which was established not long ago, to disintegrate again. We sincerely request that the country investigate the reception of ships and the reasons why they cannot be handled, and request prompt compensation and allocation of enemy and puppet ships to restore the original pre-war foundation.

Inland River Steamships

The representative of the Trade Association explained (1) that the Shanghai Inland River Steamship Company, an enemy and puppet organization, should be returned for liquidation, with the principles being (A) enemy and puppet shares confiscated, (B) privately owned shares forcibly requisitioned returned, and (C) voluntary investments confiscated. (2) Compensate for ships lost in the Anti-Japanese War. (3) Stop the sale of inland river ships to facilitate the revival of inland river shipping.

Rayon

And the Rubber Money Association representative appealed for three points: (1) The Ministry of Economic Affairs attempts to make exorbitant profits by receiving materials worth tens of thousands of yuan and selling them for more than one million yuan, which is inconsistent with the government's policy of stabilizing prices. (2) Very few factories have been put up for sale by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and most have not resumed work. (3) Factories are sold at high prices, and privately owned factories cannot afford to purchase them.

Electrical

The representative of the Commercial Trade Association painfully explained that the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau takes advantage of its position to benefit itself, and delays returning privately owned assets. At the same time, it does not strictly manage the sealed warehouses, causing the country to suffer great losses.

After listening to the reports of the representatives, Committee Member Cheng Zhonghang stood up again to address the audience. Regarding the various points made by the representatives against the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, he hoped that they could appeal directly to the Review Committee of the bureau regarding improper matters such as the procedures for selling materials, because the Review Committee is the highest decision-making body of the bureau for handling enemy and puppet assets and should be able to listen to the opinions of the public. Mr. Cheng expressed with emotion: "The reception and handling of enemy and puppet assets has really caused widespread resentment among the people. How could our government and our supreme leader allow them to do such things? Today, we have received many valuable opinions, and we must get to the bottom of the matter based on the clues, and wash away the many stains. We hope that you will continue to maintain contact with us in the future, so that we can exert the effect of supervision." Finally, Team Leader Zhang explained that everyone's opinions were very valuable and could serve as a reference for the team's work, and hoped that all parties would provide more written materials. After Team Leader Zhang finished speaking, the representatives of various trade associations submitted secret documents one after another, with extremely tense and enthusiastic emotions, until around 6 o'clock.

Another report: The first group of the Reception Work Investigation Department is scheduled to hold a regular meeting on Monday to discuss the progress of the work.

### Two Chief Culprits, Isoya Koshiro and Tani Hisao, Transferred to Military Court Today, Tani Hisao Tries to Shirk Responsibility for the Nanjing Massacre, Isoya Frankly Admits to Crimes of Aggression Against China

Isoya Koshiro and Tani Hisao, two major war criminals who launched the war of aggression against China, were escorted to Shanghai by special plane on the evening of the day before yesterday after the Ministry of National Defense ordered our delegation stationed in Japan to consult with the United States. They were detained in the officers' and generals' detention center of the War Criminals Management Office of the Ministry of National Defense. It is now learned that the two criminals are scheduled to be transferred to the Shanghai Military Court this morning for interrogation and trial in accordance with the law. A reporter from the Central News Agency went to the detention center in Gaojing Temple, Jiangwan, yesterday, where Deputy Director Yao opened the door and guided the reporter to visit and talk with Isoya and others. The two criminals are imprisoned in separate rooms, isolated from other suspected war criminals of Japanese nationality, seemingly treated more favorably than other criminals. Two soldiers armed with guns were stationed outside the door to monitor them. When the reporter entered the room, the two criminals were sitting on the beds, looking quite worried. Because they had met and talked at the airport the day before, they both stood up to greet the reporter when they saw him. Tani Hisao immediately took off the black-rimmed glasses on his nose and raised his hand to offer a seat, looking extremely humble. It was found that Isoya was more straightforward and frank among the two criminals, and was also brave in admitting his past crimes. Tani Hisao, on the other hand, tried to cover up his crimes in various ways during the conversation. According to Isoya Koshiro, although he held the high position of Governor of Hong Kong after the Pacific War and was prominent for a time, he was arrested as a suspected war criminal this spring and transferred to China. He firmly believes that it is not related to his position as Governor of Hong Kong, so his crimes should belong to the events during his battle along the Jinpu Railway. If his subordinates had inhumane acts during the battle along the Jinpu Railway, he, as the commander, should bear full responsibility and be sentenced to the appropriate crime. China has suffered too much during the eight-year war between China and Japan, and Japan should be responsible. Although he was escorted to China as a war criminal, he sincerely hopes to apologize to Chinese friends. At this point, Isoya turned to brag about his achievements, saying that at the beginning of his tenure as Governor of Hong Kong, he released the Chinese who had been arrested by the Japanese army and ordered them to leave on their own, most of whom went to Chongqing and Shanghai. Isoya also said that after the Zhanggufeng Incident, he also participated in the "Nomonhan Incident" of the Soviet-Japanese conflict, when he served as the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, and described in detail the defeat, dismissal, and the suicide of the commander of the Third Regiment by seppuku, which made him feel deeply emotional. As for Tani Hisao, he tried to shirk responsibility for the Nanjing Massacre, repeatedly claiming that he did not know, because he was only stationed in Nanjing for three days, and there were other divisions that attacked and occupied Nanjing at the same time, so he could not bear this responsibility. The reporter asked about the situation in Sugamo Prison after he was arrested this spring. According to the two criminals, Japan was short of food after the war, but the food in prison was supplied by the Japanese government, so they only had thin porridge every day and never had dry rice. The iron windows and stone walls of the prison were extremely strong, because they were made by the Japanese themselves. At this point, they could not help but laugh. The U.S. military manages the prison very strictly, and all detainees are not allowed to talk to each other. Tojo and others only saw each other during daily exercises. The family members of each criminal could only meet once a month.

### Three Enemy Military Police War Criminals Retried Yesterday

[Report from this newspaper] The military court, which had been silent for a long time, reopened yesterday morning with Judge Lu Qi presiding over the investigation of the case of enemy military police Yasuda Terutada burning down civilian houses, and the case of Miyamoto Jinpei and Maruyama Masato torturing and killing Lu Xiangshang. In the former case, the witness Yang Shixian proved that when the Japanese soldiers were burning the house, the villagers knelt down and begged Yasuda, but he was driven away with a command knife. In the latter case, Lu Xiangshang's concubine Wang Sanmei and the chauffeur Ma Jiajun, who was arrested at the same time, testified in court. Defendant Maruyama Masato admitted that he had arrested Lu Xiangshang, but still denied that he had tortured him. The court ordered that the case was clear and would be debated and judged at a later date.

[Another report] The Ministry of Judicial Administration recently appointed Mr. Zhang Shijie as a judge of the military court. As for the position of Director, it has not yet been announced since Mr. Liu Shifang resigned and went abroad.

### City Government Cooperative Manager Embezzles, Li Jiancheng Detained After Interrogation, Accounting Director Zhu Zhiqing Released on Bail of One Million in Cash

[Report from this newspaper] The case of embezzlement by Li Jiancheng, manager of the City Government Employee Consumer Cooperative, and Zhu Zhiqing, accounting director, was prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office. Yesterday morning, Wu Xiangzu, presiding judge of the District Court, and Prosecutor Fu Bang tried the case in the Second Criminal Court. Li Jiancheng testified that he was 40 years old, from Fenghua, and was originally a commissioner of the City Government. He was appointed manager of the cooperative on January 28 this year, and was elected by the board of directors produced by the members' meeting. The cooperative was filed with the Social Affairs Bureau. The fund was allocated by the Social Affairs Bureau for more than 14 million yuan, and the members' shares were more than 1.6 million yuan, totaling more than 16 million yuan. The manager's authority is to be responsible for business matters, and the use of personnel is the responsibility of the board of directors and supervisors. The amount of 14,428,748.88 yuan on the income and expenditure budget form on May 4 was used to purchase a No. 1666 car, which was purchased from Li Wenhu through the introduction of Chen Wenyin, and not to purchase trucks and thermos bottles. Regarding the repair of the car, it was repaired in the City Government's vehicle affairs office, and invoices were issued for a total of 1.05 million yuan for three repairs. The new car was purchased in the name of Li Xiaxing, because the price of the car was high, and he was afraid that the directors would object, so he did not use the name of the cooperative. Zhu Zhiqing testified that he was 40 years old, from Fenghua, and was transferred from the accounting office of the City Government to serve as the accounting director of the cooperative on March 21. The income and expenditure budget form on May 4 was made by Li. He originally wanted to sell the car, earn some money, and then buy trucks and thermos bottles. Then the witness, Lu Bofu, an employee sent by the City Bank to audit the cooperative's accounts, said that Zhu stamped all the vouchers, and he only knew that the account on the income and expenditure budget form on May 4 was used to purchase trucks and thermos bottles. Next, Wu Xianran, the head of the cooperative's cashier section, testified that he paid the money according to the vouchers. The large payment on May 4 was paid in eight installments. At this point, the defendant's defense lawyers Wang Boxian, Li Wanxiang, and Zheng Wentong stood up one after another, requesting permission for the defendant to be released on bail, but the court did not allow it, and the hearing was scheduled for August 14 in the morning. Li Jiancheng was detained again, and Zhu Zhiqing was released on bail of 1 million yuan in cash.

### Seeking Opinions to Revise Labor Regulations: The Ministry of Social Affairs Convened Industry and Commerce for Symposiums to Resolve Labor Issues Through Social Coordination, with Social Insurance as the Most Effective Method

Given that the labor regulations established in the past are no longer entirely suitable for the present circumstances, the Ministry of Social Affairs is urgently seeking revisions. To gather opinions from all sides for reference, they specially invited representatives from Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors to a symposium held yesterday at 2:00 PM on the ninth floor of the Wing On Building. Attendees included Minister Gu Zhenggang of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Division Chief Lu Jingshi, Division Chief Ouyang Lun of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, as well as Mao Qingxiang, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Wang Yansong, Shu Yunchang, Ji, Xi Yushu, Zhu Xuefan, Liu Hongsheng, Zhou Xuexiang, Shui Xiangyun, Wu Yunxu, Jin Runyang, Chuan Rulin, Li Jianhua, Zhang Naiqi, Ying Chengyi, and over seventy others.

Minister Gu

Acting as chairman, Minister Gu stated in his address, "Labor regulations are divided into two parts: the Factory Law and the Trade Union Law. Today, we are discussing the Factory Law. The Factory Law was promulgated in 1929, and amended in 1932 and 1937. It has been nearly ten years since then, and it is no longer suitable for addressing the current domestic and international situation. I sincerely hope that everyone will express their opinions on the actual situation of industry and commerce to provide reference for the government's revision of labor regulations. I would also like to report that the spirit of the government's labor policy lies in how to coordinate labor and capital, that is, to give equal importance to both sides. Foreign labor policies each have their own particularities. For example, the Soviet Union focuses on the labor side, while the United Kingdom and the United States place more emphasis on the capital side. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father, used social coordination to solve labor problems, and the government's labor policy is based on the principle of adhering to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. During the War of Resistance, due to special circumstances, some regulations could not be implemented in sequence. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, normal conditions should be restored, and all regulations must be implemented. Under the goals of 'political democratization' and 'economic industrialization,' the revision of labor regulations must be based on the general opinions of the people. Today, we have representatives of capital, labor, and many experts. I hope everyone will express their opinions as much as possible, and the government will adopt them as much as possible within its capabilities." Finally, Mr. Gu raised several points for the attendees to pay special attention to: (1) the scope of application of the Factory Law, (2) the issue of collective agreements, (3) the wage issue, (4) the factory inspection issue, (5) the factory meeting issue, and (6) the labor welfare issue. Next, Xie Zhengfu, Director of the Legal System Committee of the Ministry of Social Affairs, explained the key points of the Factory Law revision, including the scope of factories in Article 1 of Chapter 1, the replacement of child and female workers with young workers and adolescent workers in Chapter 2, the prohibition of night work for child and female workers in Article 13, and detailed explanations of work contracts in Chapter 6, worker allowances in Chapter 9, and the issue of pensions. Subsequently, individuals expressed their opinions, including Liu Hongsheng, Chuan Rulin, Wu Yunxu, Zhang Naiqi, and Xue Xuefan, among over ten others, all contributing valuable opinions.

Joint Efforts to Prevent Labor Disputes

Finally, Minister Gu summarized the opinions from all parties and made a proposal for implementing social insurance, stating that it is permissible to implement Shanghai insurance and unemployment insurance for workers who have economic insecurities. The Ministry has already approved the establishment of the Central Social Insurance Bureau Preparatory Office within this year to actively carry out preparatory work. Social insurance is the most effective method of labor-capital coordination, benefiting workers by ensuring their livelihoods and improving their welfare, and benefiting capital by improving labor efficiency and increasing business. It is also the most concrete form of cooperation between the government, labor, and capital. This issue is closely related to everyone, and I would like to take this opportunity to bring it up. We are willing to work together with the gentlemen of the industrial and labor circles.

(3) The committee is actively conducting publicity in this city, such as radio broadcasts, slide shows in cinemas, street signs, and slogans, which will be seen by the public within days.

Donors who donate 50,000 yuan or more will have their names listed in a team to commemorate them.

### Dong Xifan Issues Statement on Job Security for Middle School Teachers

Several newspapers in Shanghai recently published a report about a conversation between Dong Xifan, President of Tongji University, and someone from the "Shanghai Middle School Teachers' Job Security Association." According to Mr. Dong, the content of the news report differed significantly from his original intention. When a member of the association visited the university, he said that the Education Bureau should issue an order to all middle school authorities prohibiting them from dismissing teachers without cause. Mr. Dong replied that he had just arrived in Shanghai and was not familiar with the local situation, and that he had no right to comment on matters at other schools. As for the employment of teachers, all schools should use teaching ability as the standard for evaluation, which is a natural principle and does not require a special order. If the matter of employment is based on teaching ability, then all those engaged in education will naturally agree. Therefore, the news report of the previous day inevitably took things out of context, and a statement should be made.

### The Perkins School for the Blind, the First Blind School in the United States, Founded in 1829

The Perkins School for the Blind is located in the suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts, USA. There, blind children from all over the world walk, read, laugh, and play, happy like ordinary people. They do not need guide dogs or canes, but they can run around the classroom, walk up and down the stairs, and stroll around the 54-acre campus. On weekends, they pack their suitcases and go home for the holidays.

This school, founded in 1829, is the first school for the blind in the United States. Its goal is to enable people with disabilities to have the opportunity to contribute their abilities to society. Many of its graduates are well-known figures in society, writers, and musicians.

Perkins is a happy paradise. For 117 years, its education has been very rigorous. The school understands each student's personality and talents and teachers teach according to their individual traits. Exceptional sensitivity of touch and hearing is not innate to blind children; it also requires long-term, patient training.

At the beginning of the semester, you might encounter a student walking between two houses, suddenly stopping, clapping his hands, and then walking forward. Relying on the echo of the clap, he can tell how far he has walked from the house. But after a few days, even this is no longer necessary.

A hundred years ago, Perkins abandoned the erroneous idea that "the blind cannot see, so everything can be sloppy" and built magnificent school buildings, towers, and flower gardens just like other normal schools. Inside are flowers, trees, ponds, and paths, its beauty simply like a paradise on earth. The beautiful classrooms have corridors, so the children do not have to fear rain clouds.

### Lawn Tennis Tournament Scheduled to Begin on the 9th, Men's Singles and Doubles Order Drawn, Few Female Participants

[Report from Our Newspaper] The city's first lawn tennis tournament, the men's singles, is scheduled to begin on the 9th of this month. Senior and junior singles will start at the same time. The doubles tournament is scheduled to start on August 26th. Due to the few number of applicants for the women's tournament and mixed doubles, the registration period has been extended to the 6th.

Important Resolutions

Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, the association held its eighth meeting with Zhao Minheng and others. Many important resolutions were passed, and the order of all matches was also determined. The resolutions are as follows:

(1) Draw lots to determine the order of all matches. (2) Starting dates for each group: Men's Senior Singles, August 9th; Men's Doubles, August 26th; Men's Junior Singles, August 9th. (3) The official match ball will include "Ladisson". (4) Due to the small number of participants for the women's singles and mixed doubles, the registration period has been extended to the 6th, starting today. (5) Prizes will be donated by enthusiastic sports enthusiasts from all walks of life.

Strength Analysis

There are ten participants in the men's senior singles. Tao Guanqiu, Kola Sakhson, and Wang Wenzheng are the strongest. The semi-finals will likely be these four. In the second week, Kola Sakhson will meet the winner of the match between Zhou Guanjun and Xie Zhaoliang. It is uncertain whether Zhou Guanjun can defeat Kola Sakhson. It is a pity that Li Guofan will meet Carson in the first week and may lose.

There are a total of ten pairs participating in the men's doubles. The strongest four groups are Carson/Sakhson, Yu Tianguang/Peng Naweiqu, Wang Wenzheng/Tao Guanqiu, and Li Guofan/Cai Guoji. The semi-finals will likely be these four groups. However, Yu Tianguang/Peng Naweiqu will face Xie Zhaoliang/Xu Chengwei in the second week, and Li Guofan/Cai Guoji will face Zhou Guanjun/Li Leishi in the first week, so there may be intense competition. There are twenty-eight participants in the men's junior singles, and the situation is difficult to predict. The drawn order is recorded below:

Civil Affairs Briefs

### Administrative Matters Related to Rites and Customs in This City to Be Handled by the Social Affairs Bureau

Administrative matters related to rites and customs in this city were originally handled by the Social Affairs Bureau. Later, because these matters fell within the scope of civil affairs, they were transferred to the Civil Affairs Office. Recently, the city government determined that the Civil Affairs Office was limited by its personnel structure and would be adding preferential treatment for military service and other matters, making it difficult to handle all the administrative matters related to rites and customs. Yesterday, the relevant bureaus and offices were ordered to return the handling of these matters to the Social Affairs Bureau.

### Twenty-Third District to Repair Wharf

Wusong Town in the jurisdiction of the Twenty-Third District is a major port on the Shanghai sea route, with thriving commerce and numerous sails.

Recognizing this, the district office launched an initiative to raise funds from local gentry and merchants, factories, stores, and shareholders to repair the more important Chuangsheng Lou Wharf on Wai Ma Road first. Currently, the labor and materials are being estimated, and construction will begin soon.

In other news, the Twenty-Third District (Wusong) distributed relief flour to impoverished households on May 31st, totaling 378 bags. There was a surplus of 68 bags, which was entrusted to the district office for distribution. As of July 28th, the distribution has been completed.

### Questions and Answers on Household Registration Regulations (Continued)

(16) Question: Are bank employees considered commercial or public service?

Answer: Employees of national banks can be listed as "Public Service"; employees of other local or private banks can be listed as "Commercial."

(17) Question: Should monks and Taoists who solicit alms and chant scriptures be classified as religious practitioners or unemployed?

Answer: If monks and Taoists make a living by soliciting alms, the income they receive is considered a gift rather than compensation. They are considered "Unemployed," like beggars who go door to door. If they receive compensation for chanting scriptures, they are considered religious practitioners and should be listed as "Freelance." If they receive compensation for chanting scriptures and also solicit alms, they should be classified according to the part of their income that comes from compensation and listed as "Freelance."

### District Briefs

The Twenty-Second District Office convened a meeting of the twelve bao chiefs and cadre members under its jurisdiction yesterday (the 1st) at 3:00 PM.

### Civil Affairs Bureau Answers Changhong Jun

Regarding Changhong Jun's "Suggestions to the Civil Affairs Bureau" in the first issue of the Speaking Half-Monthly, according to the responsible personnel of the Civil Affairs Bureau, Changhong Jun's care for the city's Baojia system and the suggestions made to this Bureau are deeply admired. However, many of the issues raised do not conform to the facts. Here is a separate explanation to clear up the misunderstandings.

(1) The purpose of the identity card is to facilitate the cardholder in proving their identity at any time. Therefore, the card must contain detailed factual information. If it is oversimplified, it will still be necessary to go to the Municipal Government Police Bureau and the District Office to consult the household registration survey forms, rendering the identity card completely ineffective.

(2) The "Age" column in the newly printed application form is not an omission, but is formulated in accordance with the table format promulgated by the Central Government. As for why the central form does not include age, it is because age must increase every year. What is filled in this year must be calculated next year. Therefore, the date of birth is used instead, as the date of birth is permanently unchanged, which can reduce age errors.

(3) If there are three people in a household who come from three different places, we cannot be negligent. These three people definitely did not arrive at the same time. If they arrived at different times, they should fill out the application forms separately, one after the other, which is not a problem at all. If, by chance, these two people arrived at the same time, they can fill out one application form together. If the columns for "Where do you come from" and "Original address" are not enough to fill in, they can be noted in the remarks column.

(4) If a tenant has left without reporting their departure, the Baojia head should urge them to report. If the door is locked, it still implies an intention to return. The reporting can be urged upon their return. Furthermore, if the entire family leaves without saying goodbye, it is close to absconding. How can the Baojia head know this immediately? It is truly unjust to blame the Baojia head. However, the Baojia head also has the responsibility to investigate and report absconding households.

As for the rest of Changhong Jun's pointing out that the forms are too complicated, they are actually all based on those promulgated by the Central Government. Moreover, this type of form has been implemented in various provinces, counties, and townships during wartime and has been effective. Shanghai's cultural level should not be lower than that of various provinces, counties, and townships, so there is no need to worry too much.

### Return of Goods Held by Lun Chang Warehouse - Distribution Method Agreed Upon - Initially Returning 20,000 Bolts Out of the Total of 120,000 Bolts

[Our Newspaper Report] The British-owned Lun Chang Textile Dyeing Factory produced Real Linen and various printed fabrics, which were widely sold before the war. During the war, it was occupied by the enemy Japanese, and the inventory was plundered. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the British merchant began to recover. However, the warehouse receipts for the fabrics produced before the war had not been processed, and the receipt holders had considerable difficulties. Subsequently, the Cotton Cloth Association learned that among the materials left by the enemy Japanese in various warehouses, there were still some Lun Chang goods. It then reported to the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Office for cleaning and return. However, these remaining fabrics were from the Puppet Merchant Association's storage. It was claimed that they were obtained by the enemy puppets from merchants and not directly taken from Lun Chang, so they were not returned. The association first negotiated with the Lun Chang authorities for the return of the Lun Chang portion. The factory also argued that the factory's own fabrics had been plundered and proposed that the remaining portion should be distributed on a pro rata basis. The association requested that the interests of the customers be taken into account first. After several consultations, a preliminary agreement was recently reached. Yesterday (the 2nd) at 4 pm, the association convened a meeting of receipt holders to discuss the distribution method. It is said that Chinese holders of the factory's warehouse receipts total 2,905, amounting to approximately 120,000 bolts. 2,500 of these receipts have been registered with the association. The factory had promised to allocate 17,000 bolts from the remaining portion first, and then added another 20,000 bolts. The remainder will be processed after receiving compensation from the enemy Japanese. At yesterday's association meeting, the receipt holders expressed their agreement in principle. It is heard that the association is still waiting for the receipt holders to complete the entrustment procedures before it can formally establish an agreement with Lun Chang. According to the person in charge of Lun Chang Factory, a joint announcement will have to be made with the association in the future to ensure credibility. The association revealed that Lun Chang originally produced about thirty types of colors. Today's leftovers are only five or six types, and they are mostly goods of secondary quality. The types listed on the warehouse receipts are different. In the future, unless they are distributed jointly, there is no way to solve the problem. The participants stated that the types of goods are different, but they can be evaluated separately to find the total number so that they can be distributed fairly. Therefore, the holders of receipts for certain goods may receive other goods, but the association will strive for fairness. Relevant parties hope to organize a committee to handle this matter. Most receipt holders also hope to resolve the matter quickly so they can be helped. Yesterday's receipt holder meeting was conducted in accordance with this principle. The main points of the resolution are recorded as follows. (1) Lun Chang will allocate 20,000 bolts to the receipt holders in the city. (2) The amount of distribution to each household shall be handled in proportion to the appraised value of its inventory. (3) Organize an evaluation, distribution, accounting, storage and other committees. (4) After the receipt holders complete the entrustment procedures, sign a contract with Lun Chang and report to the competent authority.

Later, it gradually expanded, with members from as many as 12 countries. During the 36-year process, all members worked together to make the association's business prosperous. Mr. Haiyan then praised each member who contributed their efforts. Then Mr. Kerbel Son, the owner of the new æ´è¡, represented the foreign members, and Su Peiling represented the Chinese members, and gave respective responses. The luncheon extended to 2:30 before ending. The Public Association of All Industries will from then on become a historical name, but it is heard that 12 of the Yanghang brokers have applied in writing to join the stock exchange, all nominated by Chinese names. According to general speculation, they may be approved. Also, many Yanghang stocks have applied for listing, but only those with assets in Shanghai are limited, and rubber stocks etc. in the South Sea region are said to be transferred to Hong Kong for trading.

### Draft Plan for Clearing House Completed

The Clearing House, which handles the clearing of financial instruments in the city, was temporarily managed by a committee set up by the Central Bank after the victory. Up to now, the number of direct and indirect exchange households has reached 176, including 50 money houses and 9 trusts. Apart from 11 foreign banks, the rest are state-owned and commercial banks. Much progress has been made. Previously, the financial community and the bank negotiated to establish an independent institution, but the daily exchange difference was still concentrated in the bank. A draft plan was drawn up to set up a committee with 15 executive members, stipulating one person each from the four banks and two bureaus, two people from the small four banks, foreign banks and commercial banks and money houses, and one person as the manager of the Yinqian industry joint preparatory committee. Five standing committee members are produced from the executive committee, designating the manager of the preparatory committee as one of the standing committee members, and the chairman is elected by mutual push. In addition, the Central Bank sends another supervisor stationed on site to discuss temporary events with the managers of the Preparatory Committee and the Clearing House. After the Ministry of Finance approves, the Yinqian industry jointly convenes a general meeting to elect committee members. At that time, the bank will handle the handover, and the Yinqian industry's Clearing House will be formally established. It is heard that the position of director will be generated from commercial banks, and the manager will be hired separately.

### Javanese Tea Production Drops Sharply

[Reuters, Java, 2nd] Java tea production reached 62,000 tons in 1940, but dropped to 1,700 tons last year. One reason is that due to food shortages, tea gardens were converted to food crops, and the second is due to the neglect during the Japanese occupation, which only focused on the planting of war materials. The Dutch East Indies government is now working hard to decide to restore production and is expected to reach 20% of pre-war production in a year.

### Agricultural Loan - There are Seven Types of Target - The Term is Mostly Within One Year - The Lowest Monthly Interest is Only Two Points

[Our Newspaper News] A reporter recently visited the Shanghai branch of the China Farmers Bank to inquire about the bank's handling of agricultural loans. It was told that the Shanghai branch handles agricultural loans, which are divided into seven types according to the nature of agriculture: production, transportation and sales, warehouse, promotion, sideline, water conservancy, and emergency loans. The loan target is mainly agricultural associations and cooperatives. In addition, institutions such as public agricultural promotion and improvement, and privately established farms are also given loans. The loan term, in terms of ordinary production loans, is mostly within one year. In addition, loans such as water conservancy have a relatively long period, but the maximum principle is not more than three years. At present, agricultural loans are mostly focused on production loans. The Shanghai branch's loan range includes 21 counties. However, due to traffic obstacles, only 16 counties in Jiangnan are actually handling agricultural loans. Among them, silkworm loans in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, and Wujiang areas; cotton loans in Taicang, Jiading, and Kunshan areas; occupy a significant amount. The highest monthly interest rate for ordinary agricultural loans is generally not more than four percent. As for emergency loans with a relief nature, the monthly interest rate is only two percent. Since the Shanghai branch started handling agricultural loans in early March this year, it has loaned a total of 2 billion yuan. Among them, agricultural loans in the production field account for more than half.

### North China Carpet Industry in Crisis - Workers Demand Improved Treatment - Costs Will Increase With Higher Wages

[Reuters, Tianjin, 2nd] The carpet manufacturing industry, which was originally one of the main export industries in North China, is now facing a crisis of collapse. Weavers are mostly on strike and have made demands for improved treatment. If these demands are accepted, the production cost of carpets will be higher than the selling price in the United States, which is the most important Chinese carpet market in the past. Before the war, it was considered one of China's best export goods, with about 5,000 machines and 20,000 to 25,000 workers. The output of North China averaged 1,000,000 square feet per month, worth US$80,000 to US$100,000.

### Exchange of Materials Between Guannei and Guanwai to Occur Soon

[Our Newspaper Tianjin, 2nd] Economic communication between Dongbei and Guannei is about to come to fruition. There is panic over cotton cloth in Northeast China, and there is a lack of food in Guannei, so there is a need for mutual assistance. It is reported that the Northeast Economic Committee has decided to set up a Materials Adjustment Committee, dividing it into four committees: grain, coal, groceries, and fabrics, to preside over the exchange of materials. The price of miscellaneous grains in Tianjin is about twice as high as in the Northeast. If large-scale transportation is possible, it will be very beneficial to the livelihood of the people in Tianjin and Pingjin.

### Coal Prices Fall Back

The coal market's white coal block heard that the Shanghai Coal Business United Business Office has applied to the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Fuel Management Committee for several hundred tons of Yangquan block coal, and its distribution price is only 200,000 yuan per ton (the redistribution price for coal merchants is 330,000 yuan), so holders are cautious and plan to sell at high prices. Therefore, the market price has fallen back slightly. The opening medicine train screened blocks of bituminous coal are also distributed, and the distribution price for shareholders of the United Business Office is 210,000 yuan, so the current market price of Kaiping bituminous coal blocks has also fallen.

### Raw Sugar Selling Price Tightens

Yesterday's sugar market was still tight due to the lack of spot goods. The association opened a Shantou gang to offer a price of 91,000 yuan to 90,000 yuan, up 1,200 yuan, and sold hundreds of packages. The Xinghua gang opened Shanggong fenbai at 135,000 yuan, medium grade at 125,670 yuan, Xingchi at 115,670 yuan, second grade at 114,000 yuan, for a total of more than two hundred bundles. The Jian bang Diao Qing called for a rise of 2,300 yuan, but no deal was made. The cost of Chinese sand white, such as Xiamen and Wenzhou goods, is high, so the opening price cannot be as low as the Taiwan company's, and it must be about 30,000 yuan above the limited price.

### Canadian Gold Price - Government Will Not Allow Increase

[Reuters, Ottawa, 2nd] The recent adjustment of the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar has reduced the price of gold from US$38.50 per ounce to US$25. Canadian yu miners have now obtained some concessions from the government, but it is still difficult to succeed in seeking to increase the price. The United States and Britain have reiterated their determination not to increase the price, and South American countries have recently dumped it in large quantities. Under such circumstances, the hopes of Canadian gold miners have been completely dashed. According to South American free markets, the price of gold is as high as US$40 per ounce, and even more so in India, the Middle East, and Shanghai. Therefore, Canadian gold merchants also requested to increase the price of gold and sell it to foreign countries. Canada's gold production reaches as much as 3,000,000 ounces per year, so if it is sold freely, it will greatly affect the world gold market.

### Cotton Yarn and Cloth Shipped to Guangdong in Large Quantities

[Our Newspaper News] The China Merchants Bureau's Haiwan ship exported cotton yarn 2,200 pieces, and piece goods 2,020 pieces yesterday, of which 138 pieces were reported by the China Textile Corporation.

A few days ago, the Jianghe ship sailed to Chongqing, carrying 1,000 pieces of cotton, about 800 pieces of cotton cloth. The cotton was shipped to Chongqing by Shenxin Yarn Factory, and the cotton cloth was shipped by China Textile Corporation. There were also dozens of boxes of machinery, which were wool weaving machines from Chongqing China Wool Weaving Company.

### 700 Dan Distributed Daily - 73,000 Each Dan - Oil Shortage Will Not Occur - If Electricity Can Be Fully Supplied - One Factory's Production Can Supply the Whole City

(Our newspaper report) Li Tingdong, director of the China Vegetable Oil Factory, recently told our reporter: The supply of edible oil in the city is unlikely to be a problem. He is also optimistic about the future of Shantou prices. According to the factory's current production volume, it is more than enough to supply half of the city's actual sales. If the Public Utilities Bureau can restore the normal power supply to the factory, then the factory can fully meet the city's demand for edible oil. It is estimated that the city consumes more than 1,000 dan of edible oil per day, and the factory directly distributes 700 dan to various retail stores every day. The factory's distribution of edible oil was initially entrusted by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau to accept the application of retail stores in the city for direct distribution. According to the factory's investigation, there are 600 qualified stores. They are divided into three groups: A, B, and C, with 200 stores in each group, so they are distributed in rotation every day. Yesterday, 200 retail stores in Group C were distributed, each store with one barrel of soybean oil. Weighing 30 and a half dan. The distribution price per dan is 73,000 yuan, including freight. The profit of each store's door price is stipulated at a maximum of 10%, so it is estimated to be about 810 yuan per catty. The factory has now decided to continue direct distribution every day, without interruption, in order to suppress the price of oil. In addition, the factory recently shipped 1,000 dan of raw oil from Qingdao, and the China Edible Oil Company also shipped 7,000 dan, so there is no shortage of edible oil in the city.

### The Li Wen Case Under Investigation

â Special Correspondent Zhang Shengli, Kunming Aviation News, 29th of this month

The two cases of Li Wen's assassination occurred within five days. More than half a month has passed since then, and the case has not been fully revealed. There are various rumors in various places, and there are many rumors in Kunming. No matter where the "rumors" come from or what the "propaganda" effect is, before the entire case is announced, the average person cannot draw "of course" conclusions. Based on personal observations in Kunming and the responses of various parties to this case, the reporter's comprehensive report is as follows:

### The Assassination of Li Gongpu

The assassination of Li Gongpu occurred on the evening of July 11th. The sudden, bloody incident was not reported in detail by any Kunming newspapers on the 12th. Even the "People's Wall Newspaper," generally considered left-leaning, only issued a brief emergency extra the following morning, reporting Mr. Li's death. Fourteen periodicals, including the Democratic Weekly (organ of the Democratic League), published the second issue of a joint supplement on the 15th, carrying "The Assassination of Mr. Li Gongpu" (author unnamed), which stated: "On the evening of the 11th, at around 7 p.m., Mr. Li Gongpu and his wife, Ms. Zhang Manjun, went out separately for different reasons. After finishing their business at around 8 p.m., they went together to the Kunming Grand Theatre to watch a movie. After the movie ended at 10 p.m., they took a public bus on Nanping Street back to their residence on Beimen Street. They got off at the Qingyun Street station. As they walked into the alley connecting Qingyun Street to Daxing Street, they suddenly heard a gunshot from behind. Mrs. Li initially thought it was a tire blowout, but then saw Mr. Li shot and falling to the ground, groaning in the mud. Mrs. Li urgently shouted, 'Catch him! Someone's been shot!' Few people were on the street in the rain, and no one came."

### The Sound of a Gunshot

Another article in the joint supplement, titled "From Jinri Building to Qingyun Street," seemed to describe the situation from the perspective of an eyewitness. It stated: "Mr. Li Gongpu and his wife were sitting on the side seats in the middle of the bus. Mr. Li was wearing a raincoat, and Mrs. Li was wearing a cheongsam covered with a jacket and a white scarf around her head. On either side of them sat a young man in yellow military uniform, one of whom had his hair partially covering his right eye. Diagonally across from them sat a fashionable woman, and next to her sat another young man in yellow military uniform. In addition, there were several other people in yellow uniforms on the bus, and the rest were ordinary people. When the bus stopped at Qingyun Street station, several ordinary people got off first, followed by Mr. and Mrs. Li Gongpu. Immediately following them was the young man in yellow uniform sitting diagonally across from the fashionable woman, followed by three ordinary people, and then the two young men in yellow uniform who were sitting next to them." "I did not get off here, of course, and remained on the bus. Suddenly, I heard a 'gunshot,' and people became chaotic. I then rushed to get off the bus with everyone else to see what happened. I saw the two young men in yellow uniforms who had gotten off last shouting, 'Got him! Got him!' in a Yunnan accent. Someone shone a flashlight and saw that the person who had been shot was Mr. Li... At this time, the voices were noisy, and the fashionable woman shouted, 'The assassin is the one sitting next to me!' When I suddenly remembered, the assassin had already fled to the west end of Qingyun Street, and the two who shouted 'Got him!' were also gone. Mrs. Li also chased after them. I then joined everyone in chasing after them with all my strength, until we reached the gate of the Third Police Precinct, where we saw the assassin in yellow uniform being stopped by the police on the side of the street, raising both hands and saying, 'It wasn't me, it wasn't me,' also in a Yunnan accent, of medium build. He was then taken into the station. Soon after, an old woman with bound feet came to the police officer and said, 'He bought something from me and owes me fifty yuan, and then ran away.' Her intention was to make the police let him go lightly."

According to the record in the joint supplement, there seemed to be three culprits, all wearing yellow uniforms and speaking with a Yunnan accent. The gunshot sounded like a "tire blowout." It is evident that it was not a suppressed pistol.

### Kunming Security Authorities' Statement on the Li Case

On the 13th, Kunming newspapers published a statement by the security authorities on the Li case, stating that "Mayor Zeng, upon receiving the report late that night (the evening of the 11th) kept watch at the city hall overnight, urging the police bureau and all branch bureaus and district offices to apprehend the culprit as soon as possible, and instructed Director Gong (Chief of Police) to lead officers to the scene of the incident for investigation, and to notify the court for inspection. It is reported that the city government attaches great importance to the assassination of Mr. Li Gongpu. In addition to handing over a suspect arrested at the scene to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation, it has immediately reported to the Provincial Government and the Garrison Headquarters for their review, and has now sent additional officers to investigate." (Yunnan News Agency)

Chief Gong of the Police Bureau also stated: "The night before last (the 11th), at about 10 p.m., Mr. Li Gongpu was shot by thugs at the foot of the slope on Qingyun Street, Daxing Street. The Third Police Precinct rushed to the scene upon hearing the gunfire and took a suspect named Li Chengye into custody. During a brief interrogation, he confessed: 'I am from Sichuan and work as a mechanical sergeant at the Tenth Repair Factory of the Aviation Commission. I took a public bus from Mashikou to visit a friend surnamed Chen in Dameiyuan Lane. As soon as I got off the bus, I suddenly heard gunshots. To avoid danger, I ran away in a panic, which led to my arrest by the police.' Officers from the Third Precinct searched the suspect and found 30,000 yuan in legal tender and a small knife, but no other weapons, and immediately sent him to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation... Commander-in-Chief Huo attaches great importance to this case. In addition to turning the suspect Li Chengye over to the Military Law Office for strict interrogation, he has also strictly ordered his subordinates to apprehend the culprit within a time limit and bring him to justice in order to maintain public order." (Reported in the newspapers of the 13th)

Li Chengye's initial statement differs greatly from the account recorded in the joint supplement. The reporter cannot judge which is true.

### Yunnan Branch of the Democratic League Protests the Li Case

The Yunnan Branch of the Democratic League submitted a protest to the government on the 12th: (1) Thoroughly investigate the person directly responsible for this case and the murderer, and punish them severely. (2) Provide generous compensation to the family of the deceased. (3) Immediately fulfill the four promises, abolish the special agent organizations, protect human rights, and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future. (Reported in the joint supplement of July 15th)

### Street Posters and Leaflets

After the Li case occurred, there were many posters and leaflets near the National Southwestern Associated University and Yunnan University. The most notable were of two types: one signed by the Kunming Student Union or a certain wall newspaper, declaring "Mr. Li Gongpu was killed by the Kuomintang special agents." The other was signed by the "Yinnan Anti-Communist Great Alliance," stating: "The Communist Party killed Li Gongpu." "Ai Siqi killed Li Gongpu." In addition, there also appeared a "Notice from the Yunnan Branch of the Chinese Communist Party": "It has been found that Li Gongpu's recent words and actions have been absurd and violate the party's program in many ways. This branch has received a secret order from Chairman Mao of Yan'an to execute Li Gongpu. Li Gongpu did not abide by party discipline and disobeyed orders, so his death is well-deserved. (Rest omitted)"

### Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters Clarifies Its Position

The spokesperson of the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters issued a statement on the 13th, saying: "(Previous text omitted) This Headquarters is responsible for maintaining public order and should do its best to apprehend the culprit and bring him to justice in order to comfort the deceased's spirit. However, some people have recently been recklessly slandering this Headquarters, attempting to shift the blame, and are afraid that the world will not be in chaos, which is extremely regrettable. This Headquarters' responsibility is in public order, and it does not interfere in any issues outside of public order. Therefore, in addition to stepping up orders to subordinates to apprehend the culprit and strive to solve the case, it also hopes that people in society will provide more assistance." (Central News Agency)

### Two Official Letters

On the same day (the 13th), the Garrison Headquarters sent a letter to the Yunnan Branch of the Democratic League, which stated: "(Previous text omitted) Today (the 13th), it was reported that posters and wall newspapers posted on the streets, some signed by the Student Union and some signed by the Student Self-Government Association, contained accusations against this Headquarters regarding the record of Mr. Li Gongpu's murder. This concerns defamation of the reputation of a public office, and there are clear provisions for punishment in the law. Whether these posters and wall newspapers are related to your League, or are instigated by your League, should be noted, and a clear reply is hoped for." (Central News Agency)

After receiving the letter, the Yunnan Branch of the Democratic League replied to the Garrison Headquarters the following day, stating: "(Previous text omitted) Our League has its own political stance and respect for the rule of law. The posters and wall newspapers seen by your department have named organizations. Whether they were posted by those organizations is unknown, but it is extremely obvious that they are unrelated to our League. Your department's claim that it seems to be instigated by our League should be corrected responsibly to clarify the situation. However, our League cannot help but say that the death of Mr. Li Gongpu has aroused public outrage. Young students in particular cannot avoid being emotional. Your department is responsible for public order, and it is hoped that you will handle the situation calmly to meet the public's desire for good governance. This is our reply." (Published in Observation, Justice, Yunnan, and other newspapers of the 15th)

### Two Reports

At 1 p.m. on the 15th, the Li Gongpu Funeral Committee held a general meeting in the Zhigong Hall of Yunnan University. According to a student newspaper report, more than 1,000 people attended. After the chairman's speech, Mrs. Zhang Manjun, Mr. Li Gongpu's wife, gave a report, stating: "Before his death, he knew he would die. When he went out, he said to me: 'I don't know if I can come back after stepping out of this door today.' So, he had this premonition! He asked me: 'What will you do if I die?' Although I didn't say it, I had already planned it in my heart - I decided to continue to fight with him... He was my good husband, my good friend. (Sobbing)" After Mrs. Zhang's report, Mr. Wen Yiduo gave a speech. Mr. Wen began by saying: "In the past few days, everyone knows that the most despicable and shameless thing in history has appeared in Kunming! What crime did Mr. Li commit that he suffered such a cruel hand? ... What is this? Are there any special agents here today? Stand up, if you're a hero, stand up! Come out and tell us: Why was Mr. Li killed? (Loud voice, warm applause) After killing someone, you still slander them, saying 'love affair,' saying 'Communist Party killed the Communist Party!' (Warm applause) He concluded: "We must be prepared like Mr. Li, to step out of the door with our front foot and not be prepared to step back in with our back foot!" (Reported in the Student Newspaper on the 21st, which was edited and published by the Kunming Student Union)

At 3 p.m. on the 15th, the person in charge of the Yunnan Branch of the Democratic League hosted reporters from various newspapers at the Democratic Weekly office on Fuyong Road, with more than ten people attending. First, Chu Tunan reported, stating that today's invitation to reporters was not intended to raise any questions or answer any questions. Today, only the details of Mr. Li's murder and his life will be reported. After the report, a reporter asked: Recently, wall newspapers and posters posted on the streets have claimed that this case was instigated by the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters. What is the opinion of your branch on this? Chu Tunan replied: These wall newspapers have nothing to do with our branch. We have stated this point in our reply to the Headquarters. He also asked: What hopes does your branch have for the local authorities? Answer: It is hoped that the security authorities will handle the situation calmly, apprehend the culprit, solve the case, and resolve it according to the law. Another reporter asked: Street posters have said that Mr. Li was assassinated by communists, and others have said that he was assassinated by Kuomintang special agents. Is your branch aware of this? Answer: Unknown. He also asked: Some say this was a crime of passion? Wen Yiduo replied: This is slander. The person is already dead, and it is wrong to slander him further. Mr. Wen's attitude at the press conference was calm, and he spoke very little, repeatedly inviting reporters to have tea and snacks. His newly renovated face occasionally showed a slight smile. The reception ended at 5 p.m. Mr. Wen sent the reporters to the door, shaking hands with them one by one to say goodbye. Half an hour later, Mr. Wen was suddenly assassinated and killed!

### The Assassination of Wen Yiduo

On the 16th, Kunming newspapers published two news items. One was news from the Kunming Police Bureau, announcing the details of Mr. Wen's murder as follows:

"Yesterday (the 15th) at 5:30 p.m., Wen Yiduo, a professor at the National Southwestern Associated University, and his son Wen Yihe (reporter's note: this is a mistake for Wen Lihe) were walking north from No. 14 Fuyong Road, the Democratic Weekly office, when they were suddenly shot by two thugs, one wearing a blue outfit and one wearing a grey outfit. Mr. Wen and his son immediately fell to the ground. The police on duty heard the sound and chased after them but failed to catch them. At the scene of the incident, they found one large Lahti cartridge and three Mauser pistol cartridges. The wounded Mr. Wen and his son were sent to the hospital for treatment. Wen Yiduo died on the way to the hospital from multiple gunshot wounds to the abdomen. His son was shot five times, one leg was broken, and he was unable to speak. The Chief of the Municipal Police Bureau rushed to the scene of the incident upon hearing the news to investigate, and dispatched additional officers to pursue and arrest the culprits, and reported to the Provincial and Municipal Government and the Garrison Headquarters to strictly arrest and bring them to justice."

### Reward for the Arrest of the Culprit

Another message was the Garrison Headquarters' notice offering a reward for the arrest of the culprit: "It has been found that some reactionary elements, harboring ulterior motives, are attempting to disrupt social order, create incidents, and engage in conspiracies. This Headquarters is responsible for maintaining local order, and in order to solve the case quickly, it is offering a reward for the arrest of the culprit. Anyone who can capture the culprit and hand them over to the Headquarters for legal action will be rewarded with one million yuan in legal tender. Anyone who can report information that leads to the arrest will be rewarded with five hundred thousand yuan in legal tender, to be issued on the day the case is solved." The Peace Daily reported on the 16th that the Yunnan Provincial Government also offered a reward of 500,000 yuan for the arrest of the culprit.

The Student Newspaper, published on the 21st, carried an article titled "The Assassination of Mr. Wen Yiduo," which stated: "According to nearby residents: there were no less than five assassins. They had been lurking near the National Southwestern Associated University faculty dormitory for a long time. Several were hiding in the gate of a nearby rice warehouse. When Mr. Wen and his son passed by, the assassins surrounded them from the front and back and concentrated their fire. They only boarded a jeep and fled towards Qianju Street after seeing Mr. Wen and his son lying in a pool of blood."

The newspaper also carried "An Interview with Mr. Wen's Family," in which Miss Wen (13 or 14 years old) said: "That day, my father was hosting news reporters at No. 14 Fuyong Road. At around 4 o'clock, my older brother (referring to Lihe) came from home to pick up my father." On the way, he saw three "special agents" wandering along the street. My older brother told my father about the situation, and they waited for a while. After a while, my older brother came out to check again and saw that there was no one on the street, so he went home with my father. When they were about 20 steps away from home (i.e., the National Southwestern Associated University faculty dormitory), they saw two or three burly men in blue Zhongshan suits coming from Qianju Street, and at the same time, two or three guys in blue outfits came from behind. Soon, the gun went off. The first shot hit my father's head, and my father immediately fell to the ground. My older brother quickly grabbed my father. At this time, several "special agents" fired several shots at my older brother. After being hit, my older brother still got up and tried to run home to report the news, but he was shot again at this time. My older brother saw my father lying on the ground, bleeding non-stop, foaming at the mouth, so he turned back to my father's side. The "special agents" fired four or five more shots at my father. After the shooting, those "special agents" ran in both directions."

### Democratic League Figures Request Protection from the US Consulate

After the Wen case occurred, Democratic League figures Pan Guangdan, Fei Xiaotong, Chu Tunan, and others, upon hearing the news, telegraphed the US Consul General in Yunnan from Yunnan University, requesting temporary protection. The acting Consul General, McCarley, went to the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters at 7 p.m. that day (the 15th) to explain the matter. It is reported that McCarley said: Since the assassinations of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, there have been many rumors and concerns about public order. Several Chinese people have come to the consulate to reside and request protection for safety reasons, and they have been accommodated. On the 17th, the Garrison Headquarters sent a memorandum to McCarley, the content of which was said to be as follows: "After this case occurred, this Headquarters is making every effort to offer rewards for the arrest of the culprit and bring him to justice. It is this Headquarters' unshirkable responsibility to protect the people and maintain public order. Your office should have no need to provide protection. Our two countries have extremely friendly relations, and have fought side by side, and with the signing of the new Sino-US equal treaty, Sino-US relations have become even closer. Your office's protection of the people of a sovereign state in the capacity of a consul violates the spirit of the new Sino-US equal treaty. This Headquarters deeply regrets this measure taken by your office. We hereby declare to the Consul General that, based on the above reasons, the protected persons should be handed over to this Headquarters for legal protection." A few days later, it was heard that Pan Guangdan had voluntarily left the US Consulate and was residing in the Tsinghua Office. On the evening of the 21st, Principal Mei Yiqi's chauffeur, driving an empty car, was returning from outside when he was stopped by plainclothes officers who asked how many people lived in Mei's house. Pan heard the news and felt uneasy, and returned to the US Consulate. In recent days, it has been heard that Democratic League figures have left the consulate, and security agencies have sent troops to protect their residences.

### An Interlude

During the period of the Li and Wen cases, there was an interlude. A middle-aged widow, named Zhang Jingzhen, in her forties, from western Yunnan Province, had no fixed address in Kunming and often stayed in hotels. She had a good foundation in old literature, could recite the entire Bible, and could read characters and tell fortunes. Before and after the Li and Wen cases, this woman, who seemed crazy but wasn't, told fortunes and spread rumors at the National Southwestern Associated University and Yunnan University. She said that the character "duo" in Wen Yiduo's name, when broken down, is å¤ä¸å ä¸, which is a æ­¹ character, meaning a bad person. She said he was a bad person and would die at night. She also told the fortune of Yunnan University President Xiong, saying: the character Xiong comes from water, which is beneficial to the north and not beneficial to the south. Some people rumored that Xiong left Kunming early, possibly influenced by this. The Kunming Gendarmerie Regiment, upon hearing this information, arrested and interrogated the widow, but found nothing.

### The Attitude of the National Southwestern Associated University Standing Committee towards the Wen Case

After the Wen case occurred, the National Southwestern Associated University Standing Committee appointed five people, including Director of Student Affairs Zha Liangzhao, Dean Huang Yusheng, and Director of General Affairs Shen Lu, to organize the Wen Yiduo Funeral and Compensation Committee. On the 21st, Kunming newspapers published a statement by the committee's spokesperson, stating: "Mr. Wen Yiduo, a professor in the Department of Chinese Literature at this university, unfortunately died in an ambush. The teachers and students of this university are deeply saddened... It has been decided that a memorial service will be held at the Kunming North Classroom at 3 p.m. on the 24th of this month, expressing the grief of the teachers and students from the university's perspective. If other organizations take action, it has nothing to do with this committee or this university, and this committee will not merge with any other organization to take action. The funeral expenses of Mr. Wen and the medical expenses of Mrs. Wen and Mr. Wen's son will be covered by this university, and there is no need to solicit donations from outside. As for compensation, no donations will be solicited until the method is determined."

### The Emergence of New Groups

After the Li and Wen cases occurred, several new groups suddenly appeared in Kunming, including the "Kunming Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo Two Gentlemen Blood Case Support Association." The association published a "Letter to the American Committee for Peace Union," a "Sorrowful Appeal to All the Elders of Yunnan," and a letter "To Marshall and Stuart Leiden" in the Student Newspaper on the 21st. There was also the "Yunnan Qingliu National Studies Society," which also distributed leaflets "Appealing to the Compatriots of the Whole Country for the Li and Wen Tragedies." There was also a "Yunnan People's Justice Society," which telegraphed Chairman Chiang to punish the perpetrators.

### Several Rumors Spread

After Yan Xiaopeng, Secretary-General of the Ministry of National Defense, arrived in Kunming from Nanjing on the 18th, some rumors began to circulate in Kunming on the 19th. Rumor has it that the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters had uncovered several secret organizations, including a ÃÃ Party and three special agent organizations. Another rumor had it that the arrest of Yang Lide was related to the Li and Wen cases. Some said that Yang's arrest was due to another case. These rumors, before the case has been solved, are not enough to serve as a basis for facts, but they have a significant impact on the people of Yunnan. On the morning of the 23rd, the news that Commander-in-Chief Huo had flown to Lushan was not publicly announced by the Kunming newspapers, so another rumor arose. Some said that the Yunnan Provincial Government would be reorganized, and some said that Huo did not want to come again. It was not until the day after Lu and Huo returned to Kunming on the same plane on the 27th that the rumors of a change in the Yunnan situation subsided.

### The Problem Awaits Resolution

The central government, according to the expressions of all parties, is extremely concerned and attaches great importance to the Li and Wen cases. The highest-ranking military, police, and gendarmerie officials in the country have all come to Kunming one after another to handle the work of solving the case. Secretary-General Yan left Kunming on the 22nd. The next day, the newspapers published a report from the Central News Agency, saying that there was solid leads on the two cases, and that the whole case would be revealed soon. From the 23rd to the 26th, Director Tang of the Police Department was in Kunming, continuing to supervise and inspect the two cases. On the 27th, Chairman Chiang specially sent Commander-in-Chief Gu Zhutong, accompanied by Gendarmerie Commander Zhang Zhen and Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army Headquarters Leng Xin, to Kunming to handle the matter with full authority. The three have been in Kunming for three days now, and are listening to reports from all parties and reviewing the case in detail. Some say that the case is complex and involves a great deal, which is probably the biggest reason why the case has not yet been announced.

Hoping for Importance of Teachers' Qualifications

Dear Editor:

Today, as Shanghai is experiencing both unemployment and a shortage of talent, I want to raise a question! Chinese society is so contradictory! Supply and demand, in particular, are unable to meet each other's needs (even though there are so-called employment agencies). Advertisements for "recruitment" and "seeking employment," often of the same nature, are often found shining together one after the other in newspapers. Why not let them cooperate? Taking primary school teachers as an example, advertisements for "hiring" and "seeking employment" are also frequently seen in newspapers, showing that even "chalk artists" are doing the same thing. In fact, there are not many qualified teachers, but there are still a large number seeking employment. It's truly contradictory! The day before yesterday, the newspaper reported the results of the Education Bureau's registration and verification of primary school teachers. While some were qualified, many still needed to undergo a trial verification. This, of course, includes both public and private primary schools. Not to mention the alleyway schools, even the dignified municipal national schools should try their best to hire qualified teachers to avoid misleading the children. I sincerely hope that the education authorities will not only announce the "registration" results but also further pay attention to Article 68 of the Primary School Regulations, which states, "Two months before the start of each academic year, their qualifications shall be announced." And order all municipal schools to "only hire those who are registered and announced." With the autumn semester starting soon, the seriousness of sending the next generation into a fire pit should be reduced somewhat. This is, of course, something that people in society desperately want, and the wise education authorities should not deny that this measure is necessary, and should even mark it with "expedite!" Especially since it is stipulated by law! (Ji Bai)

Gambling Sounds Disturb Neighbors

Chinese people love to gamble and often gamble wildly all night long. The sound of mahjong tiles is so loud that it makes it impossible to sleep. I live on Beijing West Road, and the house of the Ningbo people next door is as spacious as mine, but the sound of their mahjong tiles is as clear as if it were in my own room. Because it is summer, the windows are all open, making it very easy for sounds to travel. If they were one floor away, the sound would be as if it were right next to my ear. The sound of mahjong tiles is already piercing, not to mention the Ningbo dialect mixed in with the calls of the tiles. You sing one tile, I sing another, and he sings yet another, continuing until dawn before stopping. All the neighbors find this family annoying. If we were to interfere with them, we would inevitably get upset. Originally, there is a limit to how much one can enjoy oneself. Before twelve o'clock, everyone can make a racket, but when others want to sleep, they shouldn't be disturbed. This situation is common in Shanghai, and I hope that the authorities will pay more attention to it. They should send police officers to patrol the streets and alleys to check for the sound of radios and mahjong tiles. If the sound of mahjong tiles is loud enough to pierce the ears of the police officers, then it is already disturbing people's sleep and should be prohibited immediately. As for whether gambling is prohibited, it must also be investigated and dealt with separately according to the law. Please pay attention to this, police station. (Jiang Yimin)

Congestion on Xinqiao Road

Dear Editor:

Xinqiao Road is an important road connecting the Xincheng and Zhabei districts. Recently, it has been lined with vendors, and filth is everywhere. The road surface there was originally very narrow, which has made it even more congested with vehicles and pedestrians. This not only obstructs traffic but also affects hygiene, and the vendors blocking doors are affecting the business of the shops on both sides. I am writing to urge the authorities to pay attention to this and promptly take action to eliminate the problem. (Sha Jiren)

### What I Know About the Shijin Canal July 26th, Tianjin News

â Yu Xin

The Shijin Canal can be compared to the Tanggu New Port. Its starting point is Shijiazhuang (Shimen), and its endpoint is the Tianjin docks. In order to carry out this project, the Japanese mobilized many engineers from the Japanese mainland to assist the puppet Public Works Bureau in completing it on schedule. They also had the Japanese army and engineers cooperate, sparing no expense and transporting huge amounts of materials. They used a large number of cheap coolies from North Chinaâspeaking of which, it is extremely heartbreaking. The villagers of our Shide County and the thirteen surrounding counties along the Pinghan Railway were all driven by them. The "North China Labor Association" also helped the wicked do evil by searching for laborers. The "North China Transportation Company" provided free transportation at each station. It is pitiful that thousands of these villagers died on the way or were sick and trapped in the straw sheds concentrated by the Public Works Bureau every day. The puppet Public Works Bureau had light, small freight cars responsible for transporting them between Liuxinzhuang Station and Huangbizhuang Station in Shimen. Most of these laborers who fled halfway were shot dead by the labor police. This kind of "armed construction" by the Japanese only made the psychology of a large number of villagers tend to deteriorate. This kind of sinful and tyrannical rule was hated by everyone!

However, the Shijin Canal has now been partially completed. One month before the Nazis were annihilatedâlast Aprilâthe Shimen Engineering Bureau of the puppet Public Works Bureau held a water diversion ceremony at Huangbizhuang in Pingshan County, southern Hebei. A stone monument was erected on the high ground above the water intake to commemorate those who died in the line of duty for the project. A total of fifty-two people died, and Japanese instructors from the puppet Bureau's security team accounted for four-fifths of them. The Huangbizhuang water intake gate has five sluice gates, and winches were installed on the gates, all painted bright red beforehand. On that day, two Japanese unit commanders, the head of the puppet Engineering Bureau, the Japanese person in charge, Yano, and two Japanese contractors presided over the "grand ceremony" of opening the gates to divert water. At the scene, the Japanese counselor Yano said in his speech: "This part of the project has been completed, and other parts still need to be worked on. We would like to thank the 'Japanese-Chinese' officers and civilians and pay our greatest respect to the spirits of those who died during the three years of construction."

Construction of the Shijin Canal began in 1942. The aqueduct part was divided into three stages: tunnels, culverts, and open channels, and the entire project has been completed. Before the tunnel is the water intake (including five sluice gates) for diverting water from the Hutuo River. As for the dam that the Japanese wanted to build, only 80% of the "base work" was completed last year. In order to sink the caissons, many unused nine-meter-long large iron rails were borrowed from the north bank of the Yellow River to press down these reinforced concrete caissonsâthe caissons are the foundation under the dam. This work was quite heavy, starting with drilling the soil quality from the lower layer of the riverbed, surveying, drawing, making caissons, sinking them, raising them again, and sinking them again. The sinking continued until it met the planned requirements, and then construction of the dam began. It is a pity that the Japanese did not complete it. Until last year, they changed their plans many times, and as a result, they only perfunctorily did a fake water intake project for the "military" and called it a day. (Fake water intake is temporary water diversion)

It wasn't that they really didn't want to complete the water intake dam. The reasons were: (1) The local security was not good. Near the construction site, the guerrillas were always coming and going. (2) Materials were difficult to obtain. Large-scale purchases of materials by the puppet Public Works Bureau had to be approved by the Beijing (Japanese Asia Development Board) and recognized by all parties of the Japanese Imperial Army. Before Germany collapsed, all military supplies were subject to strict control, so there was a shortage of materials from the beginning of construction. However, it was not easy to get the river to divert water. (3) The Japanese technical staff were timid. The Japanese supervisors often encountered mines placed by the guerrillas to "treat" them as they walked through the construction sections. After several risky incidents, they also retreated timidly and did not dare to continue. Moreover, long-distance passenger cars were also often threatened, so the plan was revised repeatedly, becoming more and more shoddy in order to complete it quickly and reduce responsibility. Their construction plan was as follows, divided into five sections (see the table below).

The above plan was scheduled to be completed in five years. As of last April, however, only an outline had been drawn, and the basic dam had not been completed.

The construction site is in Huangbizhuang, Pingshan County, Hebei. The general plan for this canal is to divert water from Huangbizhuang to Shimen (Shijiazhuang) and use the new aqueduct to divert water for irrigation of arable land in Jin County and Zhaocheng along the Shide Line (Shimen east to Dezhou) to promote increased cotton and wheat production. From Jin and Zhao eastward, it merges with the old Ziya River channel, and after repairing and dredging the old channel, it goes upstream directly to Tianjin. This plan is the ambition of the Japanese to transport goods and consolidate their territory along the line. Speaking of its water source, the original location was in Weizhou Town, Jingxing County, where a water storage dam was to be built, using the water from the Ye River, a tributary of the Hutuo River, to increase the reservoir and regulate the water volume. The water storage dam was planned to be made of reinforced concrete. The total water storage capacity is 120 million cubic meters, and the effective water storage capacity is 82 million cubic meters. A hydroelectric power station with an estimated capacity of 4,000 kW (electricity) will also be built using this large amount of water.

The aqueduct part of the river is 30 kilometers long in total, including two kilometers of tunnels and five kilometers of culverts, and the rest is open channels. It took three years to build during the enemy puppet era; it can be considered completed. Both the tunnel entrance and the water intake have horizontal stone plaques, which were inscribed by Su Tiren and others.

### Urgent Matters in Zhejiang Security First

â Our newspaper's 25th Hangzhou dispatch Special correspondent Chu Yusheng

When I came to Hangzhou from Shanghai at the beginning of April this year, I met a Shaoxing man with a full beard on the train. He said: "The countryside in some counties is really not peaceful. Guerrillas and the New Fourth Army are stirring things up. Although we have won the victory now, who is willing to go back to their hometown to work hard in the fields after getting used to cheap food?" It has been almost four months since I came to Zhejiang. In these four months, I have heard nothing but news of bandits appearing and looting. I once went to the plain area of western Zhejiang, and the county authorities also admitted that they felt that the security problem was tricky. Therefore, the newspapers in Hangzhou almost every day have headlines reporting news of bandit robberies, either passenger buses on the highway are robbed, or motorboats on rivers are robbed, or ships are stolen, or things are taken away from people's homes, or even county self-defense forces mutiny, or tourists' jewelry is taken away. Recently, I saw a special feature in a Shanghai Ã newspaper, with an article entitled "The Difficulty of the Zhejiang Road." Of course, there must be many places in this article describing the major security problems on the transportation routes.

Who is Willing to Work Hard in the Fields After Getting Used to Cheap Food

Shen Honglie, chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, also feels that the most urgent measure in Zhejiang at present is to solve the security problem. Indeed, if security cannot be maintained, everything will come to a standstill, just like a person will die if the blood is not circulating. After the security problem was raised, I contacted the Zhejiang provincial authorities many times and learned that a specific solution had been discussed with the Quzhou Pacification Headquarters. That is, the bandits at the border between the two provinces will be jointly suppressed by teams from the two provinces, and the suppression will be directed by personnel from the Pacification Headquarters. The bandits on the main lines will be cleared by teams from the Pacification Headquarters. The bandits between counties will be suppressed by the administrative inspectorate. The scattered bandits within the county will be cleared by the county government, and the organized bandits will be cleared by the provincial security team. The province has allocated 30 million yuan for this expenditure. Moreover, scattered soldiers and vagrants will be taken in by the county and sent back to their original homes. Those who belong to other provinces will be transferred by neighboring counties, and those who belong to provinces further away will be transferred by neighboring provinces. Recently, the provincial government held a provincial administrative meeting and decided on a joint guarantee system, that is, each household will jointly guarantee that it will not harbor bandits, and decided to spend 100 million yuan on clearing the countryside. Chairman Shen also said to reporters: "There are few real bandits now, and most of them are scattered soldiers and vagrants. Some of these scattered soldiers and vagrants are officers and soldiers who have been discharged, and more of them are from other provinces than from this province. Some are guerrillas who have been discharged, and some are puppet soldiers who have been eliminated, and more of them are from this province than from other provinces. These people must be able to return to work, and then Zhejiang's security can be maintained." But as the Shaoxing man said, "Who is willing to go back to their hometown to work hard in the fields after getting used to cheap food?"

Bandits Still Hide Traces Disasters are Getting Worse

Originally, Zhejiang can be said to have very few bandits. Although it was said in the past that there were bandits in Xianju and Pan'an counties, it was not very serious. It was only because the mountain villages in eastern Zhejiang had inconvenient transportation that there were reports of bandits. However, at that time, the bandits of Taihu Lake in western Zhejiang often appeared and harassed Jiaxing and Wuxing. In the years 1929 and 1930, there was a so-called Taibao Ashu who dominated the area around Taihu Lake for a while, because Taihu Lake does not belong to one province and has a very large area, so it is very easy for lake bandits to hide. In addition, the pirates in the Wenzhou-Taizhou area were also very famous. However, they often appeared on the sea and seemed to have little relationship with Zhejiang Province. Other parts of the Xianxia Mountains were sometimes not very peaceful because they were at the junction of Fujian and Zhejiang, but it was not too serious. During the Anti-Japanese War, everyone was engaged in the Anti-Japanese War, and there was only harassment from the enemy puppet troops. Sometimes the "New Fourth Army" also came to cause trouble. In general, there was no phenomenon of bandits like hair. Now, on this day a year after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the degree of lake bandits in western Zhejiang has deepened, and the junction of the Xianxia Mountains in eastern Zhejiang need not be said, and the Siming Mountains at the junction of Kuocang Mountain, Shangyu, Yuyao, Fenghua, Ningbo, Sheng County, Xinchang, and Ciqi in the Wenzhou-Taizhou area are not very peaceful. It is said that the enemy and the "New Fourth Army" have both lived in the Siming Mountains. This mountain has a very large area and is very deep. The "New Fourth Army" once created the "Chuanshan Policy," which was to connect the Siming Mountains, Tianmu Mountains, and Kuaiji Mountains into one piece, which could include more than ten counties in eastern Zhejiang. However, these plans were not successful. According to several people in the area, there were actually no communists at that time. Only a few communists came and organized some local bandits, scattered soldiers, vagrants, and puppet soldiers.

The current bandits, as Shen Honglie said, are scattered soldiers and vagrants, but so many scattered soldiers and vagrants causing such chaos is enough to cause great trouble. Moreover, the politics after the victory are really not very satisfactory. Taxes are added to the people layer by layer, but there is no guarantee for the people's lives and property. How can people endure living like this? Naturally, some will take risks.

### Clearing is Not Enough Political Improvement is Also Needed

Therefore, although it is a security problem, it involves a very wide range of things. It is not enough to just clear it. We also need political improvement. In fact, political improvement can curb the source of chaos. Of course, in the current stage, we are not opposed to clearing. We want clean politics and the implementation of clearing scattered bandits. Do not use clearing as an excuse to accuse and frame people. Do not use clearing as an excuse to establish many countryside clearing institutions and then demand money from the people. All of this is wrong. As Shen Honglie said, now we must "give the people a rest," so clearing the countryside is to eliminate the bad guys who disturb the people and make them uneasy, so as to "give the people a rest."

We ask the government to actively take in scattered soldiers and vagrants, and all soldiers with untidy clothes and no symbols should be sent to the reception center, and the people should be rewarded for doing so. We ask the government to strictly control the areas of the Siming Mountains, Tianmu Mountains, Kuaiji Mountains, etc., so as to prevent bad guys from hiding. We hope that Zhejiang will return to an era of peace and prosperity.

A friend said angrily: "Since the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are still going to fight, why did they have to downsize the army, resulting in discharged soldiers causing such chaos and making our Zhejiang so uneasy." But downsizing the army is ultimately a necessary policy of the country. We ultimately do not want the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to really fight. We would rather find a way to solve our current pain.

### Full Picture of the Zhejiang Administrative Conference

â 21st Hangzhou Dispatch Our Newspaper Reporter Huang Xing Tian

"Nineteen provinces and regions are reporting disasters, and 30 million people are starving." The current situation in China has reached the point of bankruptcy, but there are still people who disregard the people's suffering and deliberately cause internal strife! Just taking Zhejiang as an example, if we open the newspapers in Hangzhou, the provincial capital, there is news of bandits robbing and disasters being severe every day. To borrow Chairman Shen's own words, after he inspected five administrative regions, a total of more than 20 counties, "I saw that the county towns and large towns were thoroughly destroyed by the enemy, the mountains were bare everywhere, water conservancy was in disrepair, food was insufficient for the people, security was poor, and the burden of military food was particularly overwhelming, and the county governments mostly borrowed people's houses, schools mostly borrowed temples, the police were short of food and clothing, the lives of public school teachers were difficult, and everything was waiting to be done, but no money could be found..." The people's pain and the government's difficulties are all in his words. But how can we break through this difficult situation? Chairman Shen convened a provincial administrative conference just three months after taking office, and his greatest motivation was to relieve the people's difficulties and find a suitable medicine for the local government, which was suffering from severe anemia.

### Administrative Conference Like a Doctors' Consultation

"Zhejiang is a healthy person, but now he is suffering from a severe typhoid fever. Officials are originally doctors, and the administrative conference is like a doctors' meeting." The treatment of Zhejiang, this patient, by these doctors is based on Chairman Shen's instructions and starts from five central issues. The first issue is civil affairs, mainly to promote administrative efficiency by consolidating land registration, household registration, improving grass-roots organizations, cutting redundant personnel and institutions, raising the salaries of public school teachers, and reducing the size of the police force. The second issue is finance. Solving the financial difficulties is an urgent task of the current administrative work. They believe that in addition to properly taxed taxes that must be collected and managed in accordance with the central government's regulations, the first priority is to abolish excessive taxes, strictly prohibit apportionments, eliminate malpractices in grain administration, simplify procedures, and in accordance with the central government's regulations, without the approval of the local public opinion organs and the approval of the provincial government, they shall not arbitrarily take it from the people. Today, the country is full of scars, and the current priority is to give the people a rest. Things that are not urgent can be done slowly, and actions that disturb the people must be eliminated. The provincial government's financial measures take "living within our means" as the way to balance revenue and expenditure, so it needs to cut spending to reduce the burden on the people. The third issue is education. It is generally believed that the focus should be on improving quality, because the original educational foundation of Zhejiang has been destroyed by the war. Not only are there not enough school buildings and equipment, but also teachers are struggling on the poverty line, so it is difficult for them to work with peace of mind. Moreover, because talents are concentrated in cities, there is a lack of primary school teachers, which has become a common phenomenon. In the future, secondary education in various counties should be strengthened, and the treatment standards of national education must be standardized and the system institutionalized, so as to take from the countryside and use it in the countryside. Fourth, the construction problem is first to develop water conservancy to prevent natural disasters; and to increase the production of grains to enrich the people's food supply. Since the Anti-Japanese War, a large number of trees have been cut down over the years, and many river channels have been blocked. At present, the floods are already considerable, but they are only in the initial stage. If this is not treated, the future consequences will be disastrous, so both small and large water conservancy projects in various counties must be carried out according to their capacity in order to turn misfortune into blessing. Although Zhejiang is known as a rich land, it still needs to rely on neighboring provinces for food, which is unreasonable, so we must promote winter cultivation, develop wasteland, in order to increase the area of production, and improve seeds and prevent pests, in order to increase the unit of production. Fifth, the security problem is to suppress bandits, although it has been two months, but there has been little effect. The fundamental solution is to eliminate the source and block the flow, and to treat both the symptoms and the root causes. First, use the rule of law, and then use moral education. The people must be able to live, learn and be taught, so that they cannot be bandits, do not have to be bandits, and are not willing to be bandits.

### 100 Million Yuan Allocated for Clearing the Countryside

The provincial government has now decided to allocate 100 million yuan for clearing the countryside. The allocation standard will be based on the following factors: the state of public security in each county (40%), the total population (30%), the land area (20%), and the transportation conditions (10%). All counties in Zhejiang will be divided into ten grades. Grade A (1 county) will receive 1.75 million yuan, Grade B (4 counties) will each receive 1.65 million yuan, Grade C (3 counties) will each receive 1.55 million yuan, Grade D (4 counties) will each receive 1.45 million yuan, Grade E (8 counties) will each receive 1.35 million yuan, Grade F (13 counties) will each receive 1.25 million yuan, Grade G (12 counties) will each receive 1.15 million yuan, Grade H (13 counties) will each receive 1.05 million yuan, Grade I (12 counties) will each receive 950,000 yuan, and Grade J (7 counties) will each receive 850,000 yuan. Each county must allocate 20% for office expenses, 30% for printing expenses related to joint security pledges, 40% for clearing the countryside, and 10% for miscellaneous expenses. Clearing the countryside and joint security are aimed at dealing with "bandit gangs" and "robber bandits." As for scattered vagrants, they will be ordered to be taken in. The required rice ration will be 25 taels per person per day, and the allowance for side dishes will be provisionally set at 4,000 yuan per person per month, to be drawn from the grain reserves of each county. The travel expenses for sending people back to their hometowns will be separately allocated by the provincial government at 5,000 yuan. Whether it is clearing the countryside or joint security, the purpose is to alleviate the suffering of the people and not to increase it. The work in the past was obviously not done very well. Provincial Temporary Assembly Secretary-General Lin said: "The rural villages are simply in a state of chaos!" Today, with the ambition to "rescue the people from fire and water," the wise and enlightened officials governing Zhejiang should be deeply vigilant.

### Financial Revenue and Expenditure Tightly Balanced

Next is the issue of balancing financial revenue and expenditure. The people have been exhausted by the suffering of the eight-year war of resistance. They already feel overwhelmed by the central government's requisition of goods and the local government's excessive taxes. Representatives from ten districts have come to Hangzhou to request tax reductions, and representatives from districts have come to Hangzhou to request exemption from in-kind levies. The government, on the one hand, has to supply military provisions, and on the other hand, it needs funds for annual expenses. All agencies feel that they do not have enough money. Therefore, some people in the meeting requested that each county be able to set up taxes appropriate to local conditions according to actual needs, but not adopt the methods of "transit tax" and "entry tax." However, this was ultimately not passed due to the resolute opposition of Ruan Yicheng, the director of the civil affairs department. Therefore, for financial measures, we still need to live within our means. According to the budget for the next year, the provincial government needs approximately 28 billion yuan, while the income is only approximately 18 billion yuan. The county-level budget needs approximately 55 billion yuan, while the income is only approximately 40 billion yuan. The shortfall is planned to be balanced by tightening up in various ways. As for the collection of in-kind goods, in addition to the "requisition," "loan," "provincial and county public grain," and "landlord grain reserves" that should be collected according to law, no other names should be used for requisition or disguised collection.

Due to the government's financial constraints and the low salaries of public school personnel, it has become a common phenomenon. Yu Shuluan, the special commissioner of the Second District, reported to the conference: "The county-level personnel with the highest salaries are in Wuxing, but the county magistrate with a monthly salary of 300 yuan, plus subsidies (105 times) and living allowances (31,000 yuan), only receives a little over 63,000 yuan. The lowest is Changxing, where an employee with a monthly salary of 50 yuan, plus subsidies (60 times) and living allowances (20,000 yuan), only receives a little over 23,000 yuan. The salaries of township-level personnel are also the highest in Wuxing, but an employee with a monthly salary of 80 yuan, plus subsidies (105 times) and living allowances (31,000 yuan), only receives a little over 39,000 yuan. Deqing has the lowest, where an employee with a monthly salary of 45 yuan, plus subsidies (35 times) and living allowances (10,000 yuan), only receives a little over 11,000 yuan. Under such difficult circumstances, it will either create a situation where every official is corrupt, or it will trap work in a 'hemiplegic state.' Therefore, he loudly appealed that the central government only knows how to increase the salaries of central government employees but does not care about the province, the province does not care about the salaries of county-level employees, and the county does not care about the township! In short, there is no overall planning..." The conference has now decided that "the salaries of county-level public school personnel will be increased by 240 times for 50 yuan, with a minimum of 40,000 yuan, using the average rice price in the local area in April, May, and June as the distinguishing standard, and the salaries of township-level personnel will be 70% of the county level." The numbers have increased, but they still cannot keep up with prices. It seems that public servants will have to endure a lifetime of hardship until the overall situation is clarified, banditry is eradicated, and the country is prosperous and the people are at peace.

### Eliminating Floods and Implementing Flood Control Projects

Flooding disasters are also a serious problem in Zhejiang. Because the province's terrain is high and mountainous in the southwest, and it faces the sea and has many plains in the east, the total area of mountainous land in the province reaches more than 100.7 million mu, accounting for 76% of the province's land area. Therefore, the southwestern counties lack arable land. According to the statistics of the Ministry of Industry before the war, the total area of forests in the province is less than 10 million mu. The mountains are barren, and the water source cannot be conserved. When it rains, mountain floods break out, and the plains become swamps. In long droughts, the fields crack, and the red soil stretches for thousands of miles. After the War of Resistance, it was difficult to adjust food supplies, and the practice of destroying forests and burning land became more prevalent. Water and drought disasters became more and more serious. Therefore, there is an urgent need to vigorously carry out afforestation and forest protection, implement land reclamation to conserve water and soil, prevent and control water and drought disasters, and secure people's livelihoods. The Department of Construction also proposed a proposal centered on building flood control projects and small-scale farmland water conservancy projects in various counties. The specific methods are to first carry out emergency flood control projects on the major rivers that are most severely affected, starting this year. Taking advantage of the slack winter season for forestry and agriculture, the national mandatory labor service method will be used to handle all flood control projects and collect necessary materials. The main flood control areas are: (1) Upper reaches of the Qiantang River: to be handled jointly by Jiangshan, Changshan, Kaihua, Qu County, Longyou, Tangxi, Jiande, Tonglu, Xindeng, Fuyang, Jinhua, Pujiang, Zhuji, and other counties; (2) Pujiang River: to be handled jointly by Zhuji Xiaochuan, Pujiang, Yiwu, and other counties; (5) Xin'an River: to be handled jointly by Chun'an, Jiande, Shouchang, Sui'an, and other counties; (4) Wu River: to be handled jointly by Dongyang, Yiwu, Jinhua, Lanxi, Yongkang, Wuyi, Tangxi, and other counties; (5) Cao'e River: to be handled jointly by Shaoxing, Shangyu, Sheng County, Xinchang, Dongyang, and other counties; (6) East and West Tiaoxi Rivers: to be handled jointly by Anji, Xiaofeng, Changxing, Wudian, Deqing, Yuhang, Lin'an, Wukang, and other counties; (7) Ling River: to be handled jointly by Huangyan, Linhai, Tiantai, Xianju, and other counties; (8) Ou River: to be handled jointly by Qingyuan, Longquan, Lishui, Qingtian, Suichang, Songyang, Jinyun, Jingning, Xuanping, and other counties; (9) Feiyun River: to be handled jointly by Pingyang, Ruian, Taishun, and other counties; (10) Ao River: to be handled by Pingyang County. As for small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, the focus in the plain counties is on irrigation and drainage; in the mountainous counties, the focus is on the digging of ponds for water storage and the construction of sluice gates for water diversion, as advocated by the central government. Each county and city aims to benefit an average of 5,000 mu of farmland each year, and the entire province aims to complete more than 380,000 mu each year. The plain irrigation rivers and dikes will be dredged and repaired to completion; in the mountainous areas, one pond will be completed for every 20 mu of waterless upland fields starting from 1947, reaching the goal of one pond for every 20 mu.

### Conference Passes Three-Year Construction Plan

In addition to the above four important and urgent issues, the conference also passed the Zhejiang Three-Year Construction Plan, the Outline of Work for 1947, the Outline of the Central Work Plan for the second half of 1946, and dozens of other constructive proposals. Judging from the current state of Zhejiang, the prescription decided by the "doctors' meeting" is not a "miracle cure," but it is inevitable that considerable results can be expected. The degree of success mainly depends on how well the "doctors" serve. Diagnosis is one thing, and treatment is another. Without careful and enthusiastic care and dedicated treatment, the disease will not improve. The decision has already been made, and we sincerely hope that the decision can be implemented. Although Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated the theory of knowing is difficult but acting is easy, it is not easy to act without great courage and great perseverance. Therefore, in his closing remarks, Chairman Shen encouraged the heads of various departments, commissioners, and county magistrates with "expanding knowledge and acting diligently," and even more with "bearing hardship and resentment." Indeed, for a patient like Zhejiang who is suffering from a severe typhoid fever, if the "attending physicians" are unwilling to bear hardship and resentment, the future is unimaginable!

Social Services

### Answering Readers: Medicine and Hygiene

(1) Wang Junmin asks: Editor, every time I read Shen Bao, I see the lofty enthusiasm of your column for social service, which makes me feel infinite admiration! I am a 23-year-old male. In these 20 years, I have never had a serious illness, nor have I suffered from ear diseases. When I was young, my head was often slapped by my strict father. Subsequently, my ears suddenly became deaf without any obvious reason. Within one yard, I can distinguish the sounds of ordinary conversations, but beyond three or four yards, I can only hear the pitch of the sound, but I cannot tell what the words are. Is it because of physical weakness, or is it due to the impact on the head and the eardrum being shattered? How should I treat it? I hope you can tell me. If it can be cured, I can avoid lifelong pain, all thanks to your column.

[Dr. Gu Yuqi answers] For hearing loss in both ears, you need to consult a specialist otolaryngologist for a detailed examination to see if there is otitis media or tympanic membrane perforation and other functional diseases, or whether there is syphilis in the blood? All must be carefully examined before a diagnosis can be made.

(2) Lv Ganhan asks: My wife has been suffering from irregular menstruation for a long time, either once every two months or once every three months, with no fixed period. In addition, there are no other symptoms, so she has never sought medical treatment. I don't know if this will have any impact on her health and fertility in the long run? Please also tell me the name of an effective medicine. I am extremely anxious for an answer.

[Dr. Gu Yuqi answers] Your wife's irregular menstruation requires blood-tonifying and endocrine-tonifying medicines, such as Vita-Life Women's Tonic and Kang Fu Duo, etc. It is best to ask a specialist gynecologist to examine her.

(3) Wu Baosheng asks: I am 21 years old, unmarried, male. In the spring of 16, I entered a silver box factory as an apprentice. In the summer of 17, a lump grew in my left armpit. The following autumn, there were two lumps eight inches from the armpit on my left hand. I applied Invincible brand toothpaste, and it healed in two months, and it has not rotted until now. In the spring of 18, a lump also grew in my right armpit, and four or five lumps also grew on my left chest. The lumps gradually grew larger. The following year, five or six lumps also grew on my right neck. The lumps in both armpits and on the chest grew to about an inch or two in diameter. I don't feel any pain. Last year, my right eye turned red and hurt, and I couldn't see for more than 40 days before it gradually healed. I wonder what disease this is? Is there an economical way to treat it?

[Dr. Gu Yuqi answers] Based on the various situations described in your letter, I am afraid it is lymphadenopathy. You need to take blood-tonifying and lung-tonifying medicines internally, such as various vitamins, etc.

In recent days, the number of applicants has gradually increased, and donations should be solicited and handled carefully to seek peace of mind. According to the above table, there is only a balance of 130,000 yuan. This relief work will face the sigh of "no rice to cook." It is hoped that Qingxia Elderly and enthusiastic people will provide a steady stream of support, so that this kind of direct relief work will not be abandoned halfway. (Editor)

### Lixing Cigarette Factory Workers Plead for the People of Northern Jiangsu

Viewing Fellow Cigarette Factories Launching Donations

Editor, Northern Jiangsu is torn by continuous war, and the people are displaced. People in the country are all compatriots, how can we sit idly by and do nothing? My colleagues and I have donated 335,000 yuan to help the refugees in Northern Jiangsu from our savings. However, it is like a drop in the bucket, and the meager amount cannot save millions of refugees from their plight. We sincerely hope that philanthropists at sea and fellow industries with larger scales can respond widely and jointly participate in this righteous act, so as to avoid millions of innocent refugees from starving to death. That would be very fortunate for us. This is to ask you to write about it. From all male and female workers of Lixing Cigarette Factory.

Donations for Refugees in Northern Jiangsu

335,000 yuan from male and female workers of Lixing Cigarette Factory, 200,000 yuan from Mr. Wu of Defu Foreign Company, 100,000 yuan from Mrs. Liu, 11,000 yuan from two workers in the writing room of Jiecheng Foreign Company, 10,000 yuan from Kong Xinyi and Kong Huijuan, 6,000 yuan from Fang Qixian, 4,000 yuan from Li Lansheng, 3,000 yuan from Ye Yongli, for a total of 669,000 yuan.

### Lanzhou Weekly

â (July 14th to 21st, special correspondent of this newspaper, Bingzi)

In order to promote economic construction throughout the province and improve people's living standards, the Gansu Provincial Government has specially organized the Gansu Provincial Economic Construction Committee, which has been established. The position of Director of the Committee is concurrently held by Chairman Gu Zhenglun.

In order to ensure the safety of the urban area, the police and military organs conducted temporary inspections on the 14th and 15th. Pedestrian traffic was prohibited in the streets and alleys in a very short period of time. The inspection results showed that public security was excellent.

On the 15th, the Municipal Government held a collective graduation ceremony for students from municipal elementary schools at the Anti-Japanese Construction Hall in Lan Garden. Nineteen schools participated, with 512 graduating students. This is still an innovation in Lanzhou.

Labrang News: The Auxiliary State Illustrious Zen Master Jiamuyang Hutuktu and Labrang Security Commander Huang Zhengqing mobilized the military and civilians in their Tibetan areas to practice riding and shooting. More than 20,000 people participated, setting up camps in the Sanke Grassland, 15 miles from Labrang Monastery, and formally practicing on the 13th, including horse racing and shooting arrows and guns on horseback. The general riding skills and shooting skills were excellent, and the event was unprecedentedly grand.

Following the opening of the Shanghai-Lanzhou route by China National Aviation Corporation, the Shanghai-Lanzhou route of Central Air Transport Corporation also opened on the 18th, scheduled to fly from Shanghai to Lanzhou once every Thursday, with a ticket price of 154,000 yuan per passenger.

The Municipal Government has banned beggars along the streets, and has allocated special funds to take in 153 people. Except for 40 elderly, weak, disabled, and young children who will be kept for support, all others will be sent to work in wheat fields and brick kilns in various villages.

The Hexi Qilian Mountains area of Gansu Province has always been inhabited by Mongolian and Tibetan compatriots as nomadic areas. The household registration of Baojia has not yet been compiled, and the local organizations still follow the old rules. In order to support the border people and strengthen the organization, the Provincial Government has formulated measures for compiling and organizing Baojia in the Qilian Mountains border area, and has submitted them to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Interior for approval. Yang Jingmin, the section chief of the Department of Civil Affairs, has been appointed as the supervisor to go to the Qilian Mountains to start the compilation and inspection.

The price of gold fell again and again, and the price of gold bars fell from 216,000 yuan per tael to 200,500 yuan. The price of grain also fell as new wheat entered the market, with wheat at 19,000 yuan per unit.

### Summer in Lushan

â Ping Zhai

Since the summer of the 26th year of the Republic of China, we can no longer look at Lushan with the eyes of admiring scenic spots and historical sites.

The eight years of fierce War of Resistance wrote a glorious prologue in Lushan. Lushan has since become an immortal name in the history of the revival of the Chinese nation. This name will forever symbolize unity, heroism, victory, and glory.

This summer, Lushan is facing its first summer after victory. After nine years of neglect, this Chinese "Summer Capital" has awakened.

President Chiang and his wife, who have worked hard and made great contributions, have returned to their old touring grounds. Moreover, Marshal Marshall, a true friend of China, has also come to this beautiful summer capital. His hard work day and night will always be remembered by all the Chinese people.

Ambassador Stuart walked to

He presented his credentials to the President's residence, which was an unprecedented event in diplomatic historyâAmbassador Stuart added an unprecedented charm to diplomatic history: May this kind of sincerity and simplicity forever replace red tape in international negotiations in the future!

Then, Norwegian Ambassador Oerl and Afghan Minister arrived one after another to present their credentials. Soon, the new British Ambassador Sir Stevenson will also follow.

Nine years ago, Lushan brought us unity; today, we firmly believe that Lushan will make this unity more solid and permanent!

Spring and Autumn

### Replaying a Tired Tune

â Xi Ting

â Listening to music, learning music!

Whether rich or poor, everyone has things they wish were different; therefore, everyone has their own difficulties and sorrows. The only way to alleviate these troubles is through spiritual fulfillment, compensating for the imperfections of reality. This spiritual fulfillment isn't religion or moral concepts, but art. - Life cannot be separated from science, and especially not from art.

Art naturally isn't limited to music, but here, we're only referring to music. Music is the most abstract and direct of the arts, directly evoking resonance in the human heart. The music itself is merely the vibration of air, but this vibration directly touches people's eardrums and hearts. After you've listened to a march, if I ask you, "Did it resonate with you?" you might answer, "I didn't shout out." But I clearly saw your body swaying rhythmically as the symphony orchestra played the march, your feet tapping to the same beat, and your heart rate quickening.

â This is resonance. When you resonate, you leave all worldly troubles behind.

The time is now, the place is here. There are too many things making you sad. Continuing to be sad will lead to extreme nervous breakdowns, and there needs to be a remedy. I'm not advising everyone to escape reality or responsibility, but I believe that in Shanghai right now, mental hospitals are poorly equipped and expensive. It's not worth going to a hospital for mild mental illness, and most people don't have that habit anyway. The best method is to allow yourself to often be intoxicated, and let your nerves relax. That is, to listen to music or learn music. Music isn't medicine, and won't take effect immediately, but it's a type of nourishment. Long-term absorption can enrich your life.

In Shanghai, the only symphony orchestra (the Municipal Symphony Orchestra) has fixed performances twice a week. To cater to the audience's interests, the programs they play are very popular, so not many people find them unacceptable. Moreover, they invite people from all walks of life to their fixed practice times for free - why not listen?

In Shanghai, there are many places to rent pianos and find private music teachers. If you aren't living in extreme poverty, then taking time outside of school textbooks and formal work to study music is ideal!

When writing about music, it's hard to avoid old tunes, but there's still a need to replay those tunes!

### Future of the Publishing Industry

â Wang Pingling

Advocating academics and revitalizing culture, though requiring freedom of thought and academic independence, still greatly needs the government's substantial promotion and planned advocacy. Even more, it needs sound and responsible cultural institutions and profound cultural policies, sparing no effort to serve the cultural sphere, uniting cultural workers nationwide under the banner of building a new China, aiming for directions that are one hundred percent beneficial to the nation's survival, and exerting the best effort. For example, the printing of scientific monographs, systematic translation of renowned foreign philosophical and literary works, planned compilation of scientific textbooks and collections, and large-scale distribution of popular science readings are not things that ordinary publishers can handle. The government must exert its full strength to take charge. Only by fostering a culture of scientific research, making scientific common knowledge a necessity for people's lives, can a profitable path be opened for the general publishing industry, shifting towards the promotion and printing of science. But today, we cannot but rely on the government.

To build a new China, we must have the newest wisdom and the most advanced scientific knowledge and technology. In the government's plans to promote academics, it must closely align with the needs of nation-building and execute its glorious mission. If it remains cautious, fearing the loss of national heritage, and only capable of preserving the quintessence of the nation, it is far from sufficient!

(4) Hopes for the Future

People living in darkness always feel that a hope shines like the sun overhead. Even if the sun's light is temporarily obscured by smog and becomes a pitch-black night, we believe that the shining sun will not disappear. Therefore, people have a kind of endurance, gritting their teeth and enduring all possible disasters, waiting for the smoke to clear and the light to come. I have always had such an unwavering belief, never pessimistic, always holding onto fervent hope, looking forward to a bright tomorrow. Similarly, I also believe that, although China's culture is currently in a post-war desolate wasteland, presenting unprecedented decline; although it is shrouded in dismal sorrow amidst the catastrophe of war having barely ended and turmoil erupting again, it is worth comforting ourselves that the young people of China, having been baptized by eight years of blood and fire, can distinguish between right and wrong, see clearly the straight and crooked, and recognize truth and falsehood. At least they will not blindly follow. They ask nothing of anyone, and therefore fear no one's repulsive face, and have some caution. They believe that the era of cannibalism is finally over, and they have the courage to rely on their own perception and conscience, after "looking at the goods and comparing the goods," to come up with impartial judgments. Once such impartial judgment exists in the hearts of ordinary people beyond self-interest, no matter how unconvinced, how jealous, or envious you are, and always think of framing and slandering those who have made outstanding achievements, it will be in vain. Because of this, future cultural undertakings will be openly presented on the stage under the scrutiny of all, to compete publicly. As long as you have "genuine goods," rest assured! They will never be buried! In the future, no matter whether they are clay sculptures, wood carvings, assembled... all kinds of idols have long been shattered by the iron whip of the great era, or have been remodeled into toilets for defilement, even if they are covered in brilliant gold; they will never confuse our vision again, and will never make you be threatened by their gold, and automatically dismiss "Yuan Long's boldness," and bow down to these remodeled toilets!

Today, no matter who you are, young people, old people, men, women, etc., as long as you are willing to devote your heart and soul to a certain field of knowledge or a certain undertaking, without being opportunistic or speculative, and can spend two-thirds of your life on it, I guarantee that you will have brilliant achievements; and these achievements will last as long as the earth. Only a heavenly calculation and earthly agreement can destroy your achievements. Such a great change in psychology, I believe, is the new motivation for building this new China, and not just a factor for the future prosperity of Chinese culture. But it's not easy to come by! You must know that this is all exchanged for by eight long years of bloody battles and the blood of twenty million people!

The current political turmoil naturally has some adverse effects on all aspects; but we cannot give up everything and wait for the desires of a few to be satisfied before we start doing the work we should be doing. Even if the political situation continues to be turbulent, we still have to live. We cannot drown or hang ourselves because their desires have not been fulfilled. Why can't we actively build in the clean land that they have not yet affected!

If we want to build, we naturally still hope that the ordinary people who "are not in the position do not plan its politics!" are willing to work hard and are able to move forward bravely in various tasks that should be changed and innovated, without any reliance. We don't need to worry too much about the people of today, only identify the work that must be done and has to be done, and work hard on our own.

In any case, China and the culturally developed United States have made some progress after a long period of fighting side by side. In the future, the number of readers will inevitably increase several times compared to before and during the war, perhaps due to the increase in living standards, forcing everyone to have some knowledge and skills as capital for survival.

This is undoubtedly the case; moreover, the textbooks and publications used by the enemy and puppets in the vast occupied areas to numb young people can no longer be allowed to poison people's minds. That said, relying solely on the books of a few publishers in the rear to meet the needs of the whole country after the war is, according to common sense, bound to be insufficient. If only political disputes cease and the world is at peace, the people's desire for knowledge will be as hungry and thirsty as, or even more so than, in the past May Fourth era; therefore, as long as the Chinese publishing industry manages itself well, it will certainly have a bright future! (End of continuation)

### The Little Wooden Shoes

â Written by Lamartine, Translated by Xi Shou

We took the children to hike in the mountains, all the way to the highest points of the mountains that separate our deep valley and the Sha Na valley.

The mountain peaks stood one on top of the other, as if God's hand had kneaded them from flour. These mountains are covered with pine and beech trees, with yellow broom blooming in several places, like a gilded landscape painting. In addition to this, there are clusters of purple heather and light green meadows, with sheep the size of chickens whitening the grass. Sparkling small waterfalls can be seen everywhere, their waterways sandwiched between lush beech, chestnut, and willow screens, flowing from the mountains to the valleys.

From high up, we could see the White Ridge (Note) and the eternal white snow covering the entire Alpine range. My husband walked with the guard, while I rode on a donkey with the children, led by several teenagers who were our friends â the old parish councilorâs. He knew the trails, and he directed us along the way. It took three hours to reach the highest peak, but before, looking from my window, it seemed easy to climb, and only take half an hour. The distance in the mountains is just like time in life, often deceiving. However, the deception of time and the deception of distance are opposite; people think that those mountains are low, but in fact they are very high; people think that time is long, but in fact it is very short; time seems endless, but in an instant it has passed.

We and the children spent the whole day like this: walking a stretch, sitting on the grass for a while, gazing at the beautiful scenery, the midday bells echoing from the white hills in the Mai Song dairy village; in the White Lans village there are boundless meadows, like the landscape paintings that my brother, who was a secretary at the Dutch Embassy, ââsent from there when we were young; the White Ridge changed colors according to the hours and the sun, sometimes white, sometimes rose, sometimes purple; like a piece of iron changing colors in a furnace, sometimes appearing white, sometimes red.

Our group, hosts and villagers alike, had a picnic on the grass. After the meal, we re-mounted our donkeys and returned along another path to the summit through a small path among the wild hazel trees.

The sound of donkey hooves striking the rocks, the children's cheers, and the gunfire of my husband and the guard shooting at red bamboo chickens frightened away the crows' cries. The conversations between the parish councilor and the teenagers created a great noise in front of our team, and people might have thought we were a band of robbers patrolling the mountains. Perhaps it was for this reason that we frightened the children who were watching sheep next to the hazel trees we passed.

After walking for a short while, we saw several groups of sheep without shepherds on an uncovered open space above the road, watched over by two black dogs. They barked at us in terror. Further away, we saw a pile of extinguished ashes between two large stones in the middle of the path, with two pairs of small wooden shoes next to them, which the children here wear. We immediately realized that those children, the children who came out of their thatched huts to watch the sheep, had not gone far from here. We guessed that they must have been frightened by the unusual human voices and gunshots coming from under the hazel trees. They probably hid hastily in the bushes, not having time to put on their wooden shoes. I wanted to give them an unexpected gift, and the children also thought this idea was very good. So, we hurried to the extinguished fire; my husband put a silver coin in each wooden shoe, and my daughters threw a handful of candied apricots into the wooden shoes. Then, we continued on our way, talking about the surprise and joy of the fleeing shepherds. When we had walked for a long time and no longer heard anything, they returned to the place where they had been guarding the sheep. When they put on their wooden shoes, they must have guessed that these things were given to them by the fairies who often came and went on this mountain, the fairies who lived in the night fog. As we walked down the gurgling puddle, our children laughed, imagining the shepherds' fear and surprise, guessing their joy, and what they would tell their mothers in the evening.

What we had imagined finally came true. When the two little shepherds went back to put on their wooden shoes, they found sweets and silver coins in the wooden shoes, and were puzzled, thinking it was a gift from the fairies. But their parents were not confused. They used all the clever methods of the villagers to repay the surprise we had given them, showing that they knew our kindness.

Early the next morning, when our servant opened the door to the courtyard without walls, he found four small baskets woven with straw cores next to the threshold outside the door, filled with hazelnuts, sheep cheese, and cream bread made into the shape of small wooden shoes. These must have been the children secretly placing their gifts and running away, just wanting to repay mystery with mystery, and gifts with gifts. This kind of anonymous, cleverly delivered small gift made us both happy and apprehensive. We really didn't know which thatched hut those children lived in, or who brought these timid â fearing to make a mistake with the object of thanks â things. But they would rather make a mistake than not give respect back.

How pure is this mutual respect between villagers and those called rich people, and it has moved the hearts of our children.

Note: White Ridge (Mont Blanc) is the highest peak of the European Alps. Lamartine's mother often went hiking in the mountains with her husband and children, and recorded her beautiful impressions when she returned. The above is a page from her son's travelogue.

### Listening Girl

â By Gros (1725â1805)

Displayed in the London Wallace Art Gallery

Gros was the son of an unknown French painter, born in Donny, and later went to Paris. He enjoyed some fame for his historical works. At the age of thirty, he traveled to Italy, and after returning to his country, he produced many paintings related to Italian life. Gros's works are best known for depicting portraits of young girls, and this painting, "Listening Girl," is one of them. His portraits of girls contain a special fresh style, so it can almost be said that he has formed a kind of archetype. The paintings made by Gros mostly only cover the head and shoulders of the girls, and each painting is not only similar in appearance, but also similar in style and technique, although there are often many changes in body shape and color.

Although the girls painted by Gros all belong to the simple archetype of young girls, they are never described with simplicity; although they are all naive and innocent, they often reveal a kind of sensual charm and temptation, which is a major characteristic of the author. Gros was not famous during his lifetime, and ended his life in poverty in his later years.

Your slender hands lightly pluck the seven strings of the zither, yet it has lost its rhyme. I imagine your heart contains endless sorrow.

Why is the melody of your seven strings so hurried, then suddenly so melancholic?

In the rain, at dusk, I am weakened.

I must tell you, I have just awakened from a harrowing dream.

That small town, it is like all other small towns, ancient, dilapidated, suffused with an atmosphere of melancholy. Please do not forget that it also preserves the unique simplicity of our country.

Now, I would like to use my clumsy brush to describe this small town:

I came to this small town from another small town, following the mountain stream, on a sailboat called a traffic boat.

In a hazy dream, I was awakened by a sharp conch shell sound, and when I woke up, I felt an icy cold wind coming towards me. Then I remembered the mood of idly gazing at the red leaves on the banks of the stream while leaning against the ship's railing yesterday, and a sense of late autumn desolation struck my heart again.

Does it feel desolate? No, that is the emotion that vagrants often have when stepping on a new land, intimate yet unfamiliar, feeling joy yet a slight emptiness.

I am standing on the sandy beach of the wharf. The Ling Mountains obstruct the view, and lush forests are mixed with bright red maple leaves. Mountains, majestic mountains, ah, I grew up in a country of mountains.

You can imagine that the mountain stream flows from the faraway mountain country, and when it passes through this small town, it is already on its way to the sea. The mountain stream usually sings her own melody with a gentle rhythm. You should know that at that time, the stream water is a deep blue, as blue as a transparent blue gemstone, but more vivid than a precious stone.

So I walked on the streets of the mountain town.

Some people say, "Poverty makes people selfish and suspicious," that's right, then you can imagine the residents of this small town hidden in the mountain country.

The residents of the small town are poor.

However, they still retain a simple temperament. It's very simple, their lives are not entirely built on the exploitation of people by people. Many residents have enough food for their families, food they cultivated with their own hands.

Their lives have a close connection with the land. The girls in this small town are really charming. Saying that, would you laugh at me for being shallow to the point of being bored?

I said that I stopped in this small town in the late autumn season. That year should have been the fifth year since the war began, and the situation on the front line was very tight. This small town could not avoid being affected. However, that year's winter, a harsh winter, finally passed. March in spring, the small town.

Thinking: houses surrounded by kudzu vines, dusk opens its black wings and surrounds this building, the peach blossoms in the courtyard close, their smiling petals, and the pond also has the breath of spring, slightly wrinkled by the evening breeze. The night travelers on the stone slab road outside walk lightly, as if they were carefully afraid of stepping on an ant, it is really quiet. At this time, you should find that the lingering red glow of the mountain is completely faded, and the twilight has completely subdued the western mountain. At this moment, I say that the tung oil lamp of that building should also be lit!

Yes! The oil lamp is lit, and it also makes a "crackling" sound. A melancholy child, a young girl, is faintly visible by the window.

She is eighteen years old, but this young life has so much suffering and endless sorrow. Alas, from her we also glimpse this small town; that is, the struggle of a new force being coerced by the old declining force.

This girl is melancholic, but even more charming.

When I say charming, I'm talking about her character. Through her beautiful appearance, I touch her beautiful soul even more.

She is like a piece of new earth, exuding theéfragrant of mud, chaste, simple, endless praise, her slender hands lightly play a sad tune. Her tune has even caused the dusk of March in spring to exude an atmosphere of late autumn desolation. This girl is sad enough, her misfortune is also the misfortune of this small town, and the tragedy that comes with the war.

Alas, I said, I secretly listened to her playing the seven-string zither from the attic, and by the evening of the next day, we had become good friends:.......

The years of war are long, and in this difficult era, when the wild horses of emotion begin to run, we can still rein them in.

In those days, even if we had love for a certain place, undoubtedly, an enormous force controlled us. We shouldn't have any lingering thoughts about children!

March in spring, in the fifth year of the war, was our beginning, and also our end.

â So, you should understand my lingering feelings for that small town at this moment.

In a corner of the metropolis, that tune that evokes my sorrow comes again from the red foreign-style building across the window.

I should write something down; very tragically, that girl's life ended in a difficult childbirth, and later that small town continued to suffer from artificial wars and disasters.

To the young children of the same generation, I pour out my feelings, and we must also denounce the times!

Today, I write, line after line, beautiful souls, please listen to my voice.

"Weakened? For whom?" "For the fate of our generation!" you say, I am delighted.

But, this is just a dream.

(March 5, 15th, Shanghai).

### Reading

â Shao Fu

The recession in the publishing industry has secondary effects on the economy, but the most serious crisis is the decline of public intelligence. It sounds like a joke to tell people that a best-selling book only sells two or three thousand copies, and magazines at most only reach around ten thousand copies. Why is this happening? Some say it is due to the weak purchasing power of readers. This is only a figure of speech; in fact, I absolutely do not believe it.

There is no need to cite other examples. When the Xingdong team is in Shanghai, the gate revenue per game is considerable, and the highest ticket prices sell for tens of thousands of dollars. How much do the tickets for Ma Lianliang and Mei Lanfang cost? Perhaps some will say that these are performances by famous players and famous actors, and are not examples to be taken seriously. Then, what about the daily revenue of dance halls, restaurants, and cinemas? It is difficult to establish the argument of weak purchasing power. To be honest, the people of Shanghai today would rather spend ten thousand dollars on a glass belt or seventy-five thousand dollars on a glass cigarette case than spend six hundred dollars on a copy of "Seeing and Hearing" or "News World," or eight thousand dollars on a copy of "Jean-Christophe." This is not a question of purchasing power; it is a question of not wanting to buy books and not wanting to read.

Let's not talk about the utilitarian view that reading is beneficial and that there are golden houses in books. Even in terms of recreation and entertainment, reading is the most economical and convenient method. At any time, any place, and in any form, you can seize the joy in books, and for a few thousand dollars, you can have several books, unlike dancing, where once you stop, you have nothing left, or like watching movies, where you leave the theater with nothing left. Therefore, reading is the most economical, convenient, and practical form of entertainment.

We intend to launch a reading movement, and we hope that everyone can take an hour or half an hour each day to read a few pages of a book, or even read two magazines. However, many things that promote obscenity, harbor pirates, spread rumors, and create trouble are not within the scope of what we should read.

### American Films in Shanghai: Miniature Films to Arrive in China

â Yin Huai

"So far, Hollywood movies in China have only targeted a relatively small number of intellectuals in a few large cities, which is not enough." A Shanghai-based executive of an American film company recently told reporters: "Film is the best educational tool, making knowledge visual. During the recent war, it helped the U.S. government train a large army, reducing the time and expanding the effect. Its entertainment value is also extremely high; after a day's work, film brings great pleasure. Therefore, it should not belong only to a few noble urban people; it should penetrate the people, allowing millions of hardworking masses in the countryside to enjoy it together. Several of Hollywood's most progressive production companies have already decided to do so."

China's farmers account for more than 80% of the total population. Most of them are trapped in the shadows of ignorance, with no entertainment, only labor. It is quite touching that Hollywood is now paying attention to China's vast and uncared-for common people.

Their approach is to introduce the newly invented 16mm miniature films from the war period to China. Hollywood movies are usually in the large 35mm size. Because the projection equipment is heavy and the mobility is poor, it is not easy to spread them widely. Sixteen-millimeter films take up less space, and the projection machine is lighter and more convenient. It can penetrate the most remote villages. As long as there is a room and a few people gather, it can be screened immediately. At the same time, because it requires less electricity, it comes with a small generator, so there is no need to worry about the lack of power plants in rural areas.

Mandarin Dialogue

Are you afraid that farmers don't understand English? Hollywood filmmakers have already considered this point. They are preparing to dub all of them with Mandarin narration and dialogue, plus Chinese titles. This has already been revealed in the recent newsreels.

The 16mm films will include many educational and cultural short films, which should be quite effective in educating our farmers. But most of them will be abridged versions of ordinary 35mm films. Farmers will enjoy this eighth art at a lower price.

There are about a dozen Hollywood film merchants in Shanghai. The eight largest onesâRKO, MGM, United Artists, Universal, Columbia, 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros., and Paramountâhave formed a film association to handle collective interests such as coordination and negotiation. Developing and promoting 16mm films is one of their agendas. Although some, like MGM and RKO, are said to have already shipped some of these films, there are at least two major difficulties in actual implementation.

There Are Also Difficulties

First, because the United States itself has an extreme need for 16mm projection machines, it is currently unable to export them in large quantities. Second, there are difficulties with imports through the Shanghai Customs. As early as March of this year, the Jianghai Customs implemented a new policy, stipulating that American film merchants are only allowed to import 60,000 meters of new film per quarter due to the lack of foreign exchange, regardless of the number of films. As a result, the New York headquarters of American film merchants are having a big headache. Should they import 35mm films for urban screenings, which are guaranteed to sell seats? Or should they import 16mm films that can only be screened in rural areas? (Because the United States stipulates that 16mm films can only be screened in places without 35mm cinema equipment.) Merchants will naturally not forget the foreign exchange income. They will certainly not import pleasing films for a good-sounding "empty name."

Their ultimate goal is still foreign exchange.

Good Income

Let's read their harvest figures. For example, "Arabian Nights" is said to have been screened for more than 60 days, with three screenings each day, and the ticket revenue is more than 10 million yuan. After deducting entertainment donations and business taxes, the net profit is about 6 million yuan. The split ratio between the film merchant and the theater is between 40% and 50%, that is, the film merchant can get 3 million yuan in legal tender. The net income for more than 60 days is close to 180 million yuan. Although it is only a meager amount of less than 90,000 U.S. dollars when converted into U.S. currency, it is still a considerable figure when combined.

Money is the prey that every merchant in the world eyes, and American film merchants are no exception. Another view of 16mm films can be annotated with this: the vast countryside is a virgin land yet to be cultivated, which may become their vast hunting ground. The restrictions of the customs can also explain that they want to control some of the leaked foreign exchange. And the educational value of movies is an undeniable fact. Therefore, it is not easy to decide who is right and who is wrong.

Since June 29, American films arriving in China have been actually subject to this restriction. The American film merchants in Shanghai (mainly the film association) are already in negotiations through the American consulate, and the New York headquarters have also discussed a compromise with our government through diplomatic channels. They proposed that the restriction should be based on the number of new films, so that the length and copies can be adjusted as needed. According to their estimate, each company can import 36 new films per quarter, with three copies of each new film, which can roughly meet the needs of the Chinese film market.

What happens next will have to wait for the next episode.

### China's Famine, Shanghai Holds Taoist Rituals

â Xin Fang

The seventh month of the lunar calendar is here again, and the neighborhoods in Shanghai are initiating the Taiping Gong Jiao again. I feel that the authorities absolutely need to prohibit this kind of Taiping Gong Jiao ritual. All parts of China, and even the world, can be said to be experiencing famine. Shanghai is now suffering from a cholera epidemic. Many people are suffering from economic relations and cannot get reasonable medical treatment, so they lose their lives. Can we turn a blind eye to these things? Can the ghosts and gods protect us from getting an epidemic? In today's atomic age, I do not want another Chinese to believe in this kind of stupid act. I want to loudly shout to abolish the Taoist Ritual!

The Chinese have always had a tendency to worship superstition and ignore and not ask about the world. The reason why the custom of Taoist rituals cannot be broken is also largely because of this. However, the new China after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War absolutely does not allow such things as Taoist rituals anymore! After eight years of arduous war, the national social economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the spiritual or material losses of the people are uncountable. Who can say that the boring and ridiculous Taoist rituals should not be abolished?

### Tonight's Program at the Municipal Government's Amusement Park

The Municipal Government Symphony Orchestra will hold a concert at Yiyuan tonight (August 3). The program includes famous pieces such as Tchaikovsky's "Waltz of the Flowers" and Puccini's "Madame Butterfly." Famous soprano Ms. Mao Aili has been specially invited to perform solo. Ms. Mao is a top student of Shanghai's famous teacher Professor Su Shilin. Tonight, Ms. Mao will collaborate with the orchestra to perform the aria "Tosca" from "Don Giovanni" and the romance from "Tosca" and other famous songs.

Tonight's program is as follows: Rossini's "William Tell" Overture, Tchaikovsky's "Waltz of the Flowers" from "The Nutcracker" ballet and his "Andante Cantabile" from his Fifth Symphony, Delibes' ballet music "CoppÃ©lia," Ms. Mao Aili's solo, Mozart's "Don Giovanni," Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana," selections from Puccini's "Tosca" and selections from the opera "Madame Butterfly," and the march from the "Sigurd Jorsalfar" suite.

### The Inevitable Trend

â Luo Ting

The fees charged by Shanghai schools are becoming more and more innovative and bizarre. In our school (a certain university in Pudong), the dormitory fees are divided into various grades starting next semester. The highest price is 24,000 yuan for rooms with windows on two sides and fresh air, and the lowest is 18,000 yuan for north-facing rooms, which get the northwest wind in winter and the scorching sun in summer. South-facing rooms are 20,000 yuan. This allows rights and obligations to be equal: good rooms have high prices, and bad rooms have low prices.

This is indeed very novel and very suitable for the atmosphere of Shanghai.

Everything is commodified, it's the inevitable trend, there is no way!

### Honeymooning Before Marriage: It's Okay in the Soviet Union

â Zhang Tianyou

After reading Mr. Wu Jianhua's article "Grumbling," I couldn't help but feel something, so I'm saying a few words as well.

Mr. Wu was endlessly emotional because two male and female students under the age of twenty went on a honeymoon without getting married, and even called themselves "free" in court, saying, "How can they understand 'freedom'? It's a pity!" He also believes that marriage is still necessary, otherwise how can social organization be maintained?

Indeed, the marriage system is still necessary. However, there is indeed a country in the world where people honeymoon before marriage. If you don't believe me, that's the Soviet Union's marriage system. Now I'm copying some words from the third volume of "Traces in the Wind":

"Regarding the relationship between the sexes, the Soviet Union believes that this belongs to personal matters, so it does not interfere with trivial matters, but it pays serious attention to the happiness and protection of children. This key point can be said to be the mainstay of Soviet marriage law.

"In addition, there is another key point, which is that men and women are in a completely equal position in marriage law.

"In the Soviet Union, there is no need for any ceremony to get married. However, in order to protect the happiness and health of both parties and their children, if you want to register with the Civil Registry, you must comply with the following conditions:

1. Both men and women must be 18 years of age.
2. Both men and women must inform each other of their health conditions truthfully.
3. Both parties must agree to the marriage registration. (Points 4 and 5 omitted)

"According to Soviet law, cohabitation between men and women is de facto marriage. Not registering has the same effect. The only difference is that if a divorce occurs after registration, there are issues such as alimony and custody of children, and when the state has to come forward to preside over, there is evidence. Those who have not registered must first have the court identify that there is indeed evidence of marriage before they can take the certificate to the Civil Registry to register for divorce.

"Whether to register a marriage or not is up to the individual, because the relationship between the sexes is recognized as a personal matter. Unregistered marriages and registered marriages bear the same responsibilities. The point is to protect the interests of children and any partyâespecially women. So in the Soviet Union, terms such as 'adultery,' 'extramarital affairs,' and 'illegitimate children' simply do not exist."

From the above words, we can see that in the Soviet Union's marriage system, if these two male and female students were replaced by Soviet people, or lived in the Soviet Union, they would not be accused by their guardians.

### Comic Strip: The Adventures of Sanmao the Orphan Soldier (96)

â By Zhang Leping

### Americanized Chinese Medicine (Part 2)

â Xu Guiting

The most effective medicine for coughs is cicada slough. It is said that cicadas chirp all day long when they are alive, so their lungs must be very strong.

The medicine for treating aphthous stomatitis is made by mixing the ash of a calcined insect with salt and apple slices. When taking it, it must be swallowed slowly to be effective.

American Friend's Report

The above is the American friend's report. Some of the proposed prescriptions are accurate, but some of them are so incredible that even we Chinese people dare not believe them. In short, the advertising by the old men or the over-exaggerations of our overseas Chinese medicine stores are a bit bizarre.

Before the Pacific War, that Chinese medicine store also sold "tiger bone wine" for US$1.75 a cup. Now, if you can buy it, a large bottle costs US$17.

Our "noble country's" pharmaceutical merchants often use a "we are the only ones" tone to promote to American friends: Our magical medicines sell because of their effects, and there is no need to study the reasons why they can heal. Unexpectedly, American friends' minds are too scientific. They actually have a group of people dedicated to studying Chinese medicine.

Arthur Maas, a professor of medicine at the University of Southern California, studied the components of ephedra and found that this herb does have the effect of adjusting and enhancing the circulatory system. The by-products of ephedra can also have the same effect on the adrenal glands.

This professor used to doubt whether tiger teeth could cure weakness, but recently he discovered that they contain unusually rich calcium phosphate. This is the same prescription that scientific medicine uses when treating patients with weakness. Using crab eyes to treat abdominal pain sounds absurd, but Professor Maas recently discovered that they contain calcium oxide. This is an effective medicine for treating excessive stomach acid.

There is also an ancient prescription for treating tuberculosis. Its ingredients are rumored as follows: Use a pig stomach, filled with the following ingredients: a pinch of soil facing north from a shrine, a bunch of grass growing in a place where the sun has never shone, a living small newt, a living toad, some fingernails, a few strands of hair, calcined yellow paper, and tea made with ginseng root. Put them all together, decoct them for several hours, and take them regularly, and there will be miraculous effects.

Dr. G. C. Basil, who used to be the director of the China branch of the St. Luke's Hospital in Chongqing, concluded based on his research that this prescription does have therapeutic value. His explanation is: soil contains silicates and other minerals, grass contains a large amount of vitamins, newts are rich in protein, fingernails contain calcium, paper ashes are carbon, which has the effect of suppressing the dirt in the stomach and intestines. Ginseng is used as a palliative. The components of pig stomach are recognized in modern medicine as a substance that specifically treats anemia.

Chinese Medicine is Also Scientific

Dr. Basil also said that donkey-hide gelatin does have the function of promoting blood circulation and contains important tonic ingredients.

Dr. Richard Frey, who served in the Eighth Route Army in China, stated at a rally in New York to support China: "As a result of analysis and clinical experience, we have found that many Chinese medicines are scientific, although most Chinese doctors cannot explain the scientific value of their treatment."

When the old man of the Chinese medicine store in New York became more and more enthusiastic when talking to Oppenheim, he said: "Penicillin is not uncommon. We Chinese have been using a kind of bacteria to treat leucorrhea and venereal diseases for hundreds of years, which is what is called using poison to fight poison. We know that Western doctors are surprised why we use sea dog kidneys as medicine. However, they now know that sea dog kidneys are most suitable for thiamine! We Chinese people have been using them for thousands of years and always know what is appropriate and what is not. Now white doctors are just beginning to tell us why Chinese medicines are so effective."

Here, what do countless Shanghai people who are crazy about Western medicine think about the discoveries of those American doctors? (End)
