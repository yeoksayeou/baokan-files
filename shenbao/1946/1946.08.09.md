### Marshal Ma Returns to Nanjing to Strengthen Negotiations; Expected to Meet with Representatives from Both the Nationalist and Communist Parties Soon; Peace Can Be Achieved by Implementing the Old Plan

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Guling, 8th] Marshal Marshall, accompanied by his wife, went to the Chairman's residence at 12:30 PM today to bid farewell to Chairman Chiang. The Chairman and his wife invited Marshal Marshall and his wife to lunch and talked for an hour and a half. After returning to his residence, Marshal Marshall left Guling by sedan at 3:20 PM in the afternoon, after a passing shower, amidst the clear and beautiful lake scenery, and flew to Nanjing by plane from Xunyang. It is said that Marshal Marshall jokingly said to his wife before leaving, "I will come back next week." It is reported that Marshal Marshall will return to Nanjing this time to continue negotiations with the Communist Party on the issue of troop reorganization and ceasefire with his utmost efforts. General political issues are currently being handled by Ambassador Stuart, who is studying and negotiating with all parties. Rumors that Ambassador Stuart returned to Nanjing this time to negotiate the reorganization of the government are absolutely untrue. Because before the completion of troop reorganization and demobilization, there will be no discussion of reorganizing the government or expanding the foundation of the government for the time being. The National Government must build the future new government on the basis of peaceful unification with complete order in order to implement its great plan of saving and building the country. According to reliable sources, Marshal Marshall visited Mount Lu three times last Saturday and met with Chairman Chiang. He has a further understanding of the Chairman's consistent advocacy of resolving domestic disputes through political means. He also sympathizes with the Chinese government's desire to insist on implementing the troop reorganization plan and quickly restore transportation in order to stabilize social order and complete the demobilization plan. Marshal Marshall will return to Nanjing this time to continue to work for peace in China based on his past valuable experience. However, what Marshal Marshall brought to Nanjing this time, besides some new information added to his luggage, such as the report of the Anping Incident, etc., are only some old plans that may be submitted for review. There are no new plans. Because to resolve the current disputes in China, peace can be achieved only by sincerely implementing the old plans that the Communist Party once agreed to sign. Otherwise, no one can predict what stage the future situation in China will evolve into.

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Special Envoy Marshall returned to Nanjing at 7:30 PM tonight amidst heavy rain. Marshal Marshall, at the age of 65, traveled between Nanjing and Guling tirelessly. He must be very tired. Therefore, after getting off the plane, Marshal Marshall went directly to his residence to rest. It is said that Ambassador Stuart will meet with Marshal Marshall tomorrow morning to discuss issues such as the Anping Incident and peace negotiations between the Nationalist and Communist parties. Well-informed sources believe that after Marshal Marshall meets with Ambassador Stuart, he will invite representatives from the government and the Communist Party to hold negotiations.

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Guling, 8th] Marshal Marshall's descent from the mountain after Ambassador Stuart clearly aims to accelerate the progress of the initial contacts made by the Ambassador in Nanjing for continued peace negotiations, and to negotiate the Anping Incident with the Communist Party. Observers believe that, based on Chief of Staff Chen's remarks at the press conference in Guling yesterday, continued peace negotiations should still be within the scope of the four key topics that Chairman Chiang urgently requested to be effectively resolved in the 23-day ceasefire order issued in June this year. These four topics are ceasefire, troop reorganization, restoration of transportation, and discussion of Communist army areas. If the Communist Party can show concrete facts on these four topics, other problems can be easily solved.

Ambassador Stuart Receives Zeng Qi

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Ambassador Stuart did not go out all day today. In addition to receiving the visiting Dutch Minister to China, Long Yun, the President of the Military Advisory Council, Zeng Qi, the leader of the Youth Party, and Liu Dongyan, a member of the Standing Committee of the party, visited him one after another. Long's visit was an ordinary one, discussing general issues in a broad way; Zeng gave a detailed explanation of the Youth Party's policies and platform, put forward proposals on national affairs, and sought advice from Ambassador Stuart. In the evening, Stuart also invited former US Embassy Counselor Smyth and his wife to dinner. The US Embassy area was without power tonight. The ambassador talked with Smith by candlelight, which involved the China issue and the Anping Incident. When the reporter visited, the ambassador was about to go to bed. After talking with the reporter for a short while, he personally held a candle to send him to the door. It is reported that the Ambassador is still waiting for public opinion in the United States. Recently, a New York newspaper commented on the Anping Incident, believing that the Communist Party's attempt to use the Anping Incident as a means to achieve the goal of the US military's withdrawal is a complete mistake. This view is quite common in the United States and is enough to illustrate the general attitude of the US public opinion. The Ambassador is seeking a fair approach to ensure that peace negotiations are not interrupted, and at the same time, to prevent the Anping Incident from affecting peace negotiations. Some people say that the Communist Party cannot shirk its responsibility for the Anping Incident, but so far, the Communist Party has not expressed any admission of its mistakes. Therefore, some people believe that after Marshal Marshall returns to Nanjing, he will ask Zhou for a definite answer on this matter.

### Investigation of the Anping Incident Begins; Special Group of the Executive Headquarters Set Off Once; Conflicts Between Nationalist and Communist Armies in the Area to be Mediated Separately

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Beiping, 8th] American member of the Executive Headquarters, Robertson, proposed that each of the three parties send two reporters to accompany the 25th group to investigate the Anping Incident. The government has designated Zhao Xiaozhang, a reporter from the Central News Agency, and Zhang Jianmei, a reporter from this newspaper, to participate.

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Beiping, 8th] After five rounds of consultations, the special group of the Executive Headquarters for investigating the Anping Incident, following the US proposal, set off at 2:30 PM on the 8th to conduct a preliminary investigation on the spot. They returned to Beiping that night and set off again on the morning of the 9th. The three members of the Executive Headquarters gave special instructions to the group representatives last night, hoping that the three representatives would conduct the investigation with a spirit of cooperation, democratic methods, and a fair attitude. At the same time, in order to make the outside world understand the truth of the investigation, each of the three parties sent two reporters to accompany them. Because the Communist reporters had to be picked up from Zhangjiakou, the reporters could not go with them on the afternoon of the 8th and will go together on the morning of the 9th.

[Dispatch from United Press, Beiping, 8th] The special group of the Executive Headquarters, responsible for investigating the case of the American soldiers being attacked, drove to the scene of the incident in five cars with white flags at 2:00 PM on the 8th to conduct an on-site investigation. The start of this investigation coincided with the tenth day after the incident occurred.

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Beiping, 8th] The Nationalist and Communist armies are still fighting fiercely in areas such as Hexiwu, Matouzhen, and Anping on the Pingjin Highway. The Executive Headquarters decided to send a subgroup under the special group investigating the Xiaoshahe Incident to mediate the conflict. It is expected to depart on the 12th. The Communist army has added approximately 4,000 reinforcements in the area.

### UNRRA is Expected to End Operations by Next Spring; LaGuardia to Visit China; Special Far East Meeting to be Held Tomorrow

[United Press, Washington, 7th] UNRRA sources state: Director LaGuardia will inspect Warsaw (capital of Poland) and Prague (capital of Czechoslovakia) and is expected to arrive in China around October 9th.

[United Press, Geneva, 7th] LaGuardia made this announcement in response to the latest quarterly report to the Fourth Council of UNRRA. He stated that UNRRA's European relief program will end on October 31st, and the Eastern part will end on March 31st of next year. However, the shipment of relief supplies will continue beyond those dates. He will travel to China to see the situation firsthand.

[Central News Agency, this city] UNRRA announced that as of last week, 801,138 tons of relief supplies have been shipped to China. Recently, 32 ships carrying 130,250 tons of supplies arrived in Shanghai, and another six ships carrying 11,355 tons of war materials arrived in Hong Kong. In addition, 18 transport ships carrying 40,815 tons of supplies have arrived at Shanghai docks. A total of 44 ships carrying 134,500 tons of supplies are en route to China and are expected to arrive in Shanghai soon. Furthermore, three UNRRA doctors and one sanitary engineer, bringing 1,100 pounds of relief medicine, flew to Weiyang by special plane yesterday to provide relief to victims in Hunan Province.

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 7th, United Press] US Undersecretary of State Clayton told the Fifth Administrative Conference of UNRRA that the United States will no longer contribute funds to UNRRA. Countries must now find ways to restore world trade and no longer rely on relief.

[This city] A special meeting of the UNRRA Far East Region representatives is scheduled to be held tomorrow morning (10th) at 10:00 AM at the Bank of Shanghai building. Director Chiang Ting-fu will chair the meeting. Representatives from China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, France, India, Austria, the Netherlands, and New Zealand will attend. The main topic will be a review of UNRRA's work in the Far East Region.

### Expedite Restoration of Material Shipments to China

[Agence France-Presse, Geneva, 7th] UNRRA Director LaGuardia, when reporting to the Fifth Plenary Session of UNRRA, expressed regret that UNRRA had failed to ship sufficient food to China. He stated that China urgently needs relief, but the lack of transportation within the country makes it very difficult to distribute $53.5 million worth of supplies to various locations. He and Deputy Director Jacques are working hard to improve the UNRRA mission in China. Fortunately, US Army Major General Edgerton has been appointed director of the China Division. However, the traffic situation in China in June was very bad, causing supplies to pile up in ports and suffer localized damage. As a result, the shipment of all materials except food was suspended to China. This does not mean a complete stop or reduction in aid to China. As of June 22nd, 42 cargo ships were waiting to unload in Chinese ports. It is expected that the situation will improve by September, and freight transport will be restored as much as possible at that time. He met with the head of the Chinese delegation yesterday and was very satisfied. He is confident that the Chinese government fully understands and is fully cooperating. UNRRA is only a temporary organization, and the budget for 1947 has not yet been prepared. After UNRRA ceases operations, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations will be responsible for distributing food. It is hoped that the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development will provide low-interest loans to war-torn countries to engage in industrial reconstruction.

### "Time" is "Supplies"; The CNRRA hopes to extend the working period; Improving the distribution of supplies is under discussion.

[Report from our Newspaper] After UNRRA Director LaGuardia advocated that the agency's termination date should not be postponed, this reporter specifically interviewed CNRRA Director Chiang, asking what impact this move might have on CNRRA. Chiang replied: CNRRA's task was originally to handle UNRRA's relief supplies to China and transport these supplies to areas in need. After UNRRA terminates its operations, CNRRA will also terminate its operations. However, due to the need to transport this final batch of supplies, CNRRA's termination may be delayed slightly, but it will not exceed three months at most, and these supplies will definitely be transported. The termination date for UNRRA was originally set for the end of this year, and CNRRA was originally scheduled to end on March 31st of next year. However, China has a vast territory, and transportation is extremely inconvenient. In some inland areas, roads must be built while transporting supplies, and the handling capacity of seaports is also very limited. Even in China's largest seaport, the harbor has not been dredged for nine years, so the handling capacity has been reduced by 40% compared to before. We cannot perform "magic" to enlarge this seaport, so we can only hope that the time can be extended sufficiently. At the previous UNRRA Far East Regional Conference, a proposal was passed to the UNRRA General Assembly to extend the total working time to June 30th of next year. Whether or not a further extension will be necessary at that time can be considered. At that time, China's request was to extend the working period of CNRRA to September 30th of next year. China's request remains the same in this UNRRA General Assembly, because I deeply know that in terms of China's post-war relief, "time" is "supplies." In addition, the CNRRA Northeast Branch organized five inspection teams to study epidemic prevention methods in various plague-prone areas in the Northeast.

[This City] China's new ambassador to Iran, Zheng Yitong, is scheduled to fly from Shanghai to Calcutta on the 17th and then travel to Tehran to take up his new post. Zheng was the former minister to Australia. After returning to the country this spring to report on his work, he was transferred to his new position. Yesterday, he received reporters at his private residence and first made a statement on promoting friendly relations between China and Iran. He said: "China and Iran are two of the world's great ancient countries. As early as 2,000 years ago, cultural relations occurred between the two countries, and friendly relations have always been close. Recently, the new Iranian government has laid the foundation for peaceful construction, and China is now also seeking a new construction foundation on the road to peaceful unification. The mutual assistance and cooperation between the new Iran and the new China in the future in terms of culture and economy will depend on our efforts. I believe that the development of friendly relations between China and Iran must become increasingly friendly."

Regarding the recent developments in the Eastern situation, Zheng believes that order will be restored soon, and further progress can be made to promote the realization of world peace. Zheng said: "After the surrender of Germany and Japan, all countries felt the great suffering of war and were eager to recover and rebuild. They had no intention and dared not test the flames of a third world war. Therefore, in the next twenty years, we dare to assert that the countries of the world will certainly not see war again."

Finally, the reporter asked him about his impressions after returning to the country from Australia. He said: "The current instability in the country is an inevitable trend after the end of the eight-year War of Resistance. Lao Tzu said: 'After a great war, there will inevitably be a year of famine.' If we understand this point, we can be calm. "Regarding the issue of negotiations between the Nationalists and the Communists, Zheng believes that the key lies in whether the Chinese Communist Party is sincere. At the same time, he hopes that American and Soviet politicians will have a clear understanding of all their propaganda and not be deceived by it. Zheng also said: "I have three misunderstandings about the current domestic political situation: (1) Up to now, the dispute between the Nationalists and the Communists is still about territory. In such a state of national recovery, no party or faction in the country has proposed proposals to improve the current living conditions of the people; (2) Non-partisans can also become a group and form a force in our country; (3) The basic proposition of the Communist Party is to implement the dictatorship of the proletariat, but it considers itself a democratic party. In terms of freedom of opinion, if the Yan'an newspaper can freely criticize everything that the CCP leader Mao Zedong says and does, we cannot believe it." Zheng finally said: "In today's world, any country must respond to international trends externally and follow the domestic environment internally to establish an unyielding, self-reliant foundation. Our country is one part of the world, and we cannot be an exception."

### Direct Trains to Run Between Beiping and Shenyang; Twice a Week Starting from the 19th of This Month; Northeast Grain Will Be Transported Inward in a Steady Stream

[Our Tianjin Correspondent, 8th] The connection between inside and outside the Pass has become a reality. Transportation authorities in the Northeast and Tianjin-Beiping held a meeting in Shenyang on the 5th and decided to open direct trains between Beiping and Shenyang on the 19th of this month. Trains will depart from Beiping every Monday and Thursday and from Shenyang every Tuesday and Friday. It is planned that starting from September 18th, a daily direct train will run. The direct train will stop at Tianjin, Tangshan, Shanhaiguan, Xingcheng, Jinzhou, and Dahu Mountain, but not at other stations. Round-trip trains will stay overnight in Jinzhou because it is not convenient to travel at night. Another important decision made at the meeting was to transport grain into the Pass. The grain blockade order in the Northeast has been lifted, and it has been decided to transport 2,000 tons of grain to Tianjin-Beiping daily. Cars have already been allocated to Shenyang on the 7th, and Northeast grain will soon be transported into the Pass in a steady stream. The grain transport vehicles are also direct.

### Local Correspondences: Communist Army in the Haizhou Area; Arrests and Kills the Parents of Fleeing Draftees

[Our Newspaper's Haizhou Correspondence] Recently, the Communist army in the Yangjiaji area of Guanling County has been forcibly conscripting young men aged 18 to 40 and sending them to the battlefield after concentrated training. They are also forcibly conscripting women aged 15 to 40 and organizing them into comfort teams. Recently, Chen Jinde, 28 years old, who was originally a small vendor, ran away before being drafted. The Communist Party's county government discovered this and, in addition to arresting his father, Chen Xuedian, also burned down his three-room house. They ordered Chen Xuedian to hand over his son quickly. Upon hearing this news, Chen Jinde dared not return home even more. Seeing that his son had not been handed over for a long time, the Communist army tied Chen Xuedian to the Yangji market and executed him by shooting.

電籲免征麺粉貨稅 (*Telegraph Urging Exemption from Flour Commodity Tax*)

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has decided to send a telegram to the relevant departments of the Legislative Yuan, which recently passed a bill on levying commodity tax on flour, requesting a review and exemption in order to alleviate the suffering of the people of Jiangsu. In order to understand the situation of our county, this reporter made a special visit to the chairman of the Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce, Zhang, and inquired about the matter. He told us: "I attended the joint meeting this time and discussed this matter. I feel that at this time when famine is rampant in Hebei and Shandong, flour is one of the main auxiliary food items for the people. If another burden is added, it will directly stimulate the price of food to rise and indirectly hinder the people's food. Therefore, a motion has been established to telegraph the Yuan and appeal for exemption."

Wuxi

They set off one after another on the 7th to supervise and urge the payment of advance tax and to investigate the flood situation.

Dangtu

縣長逃遁交接停滯 (*County Magistrate Flees, Turnover Stagnates*)

The newly appointed county magistrate of this county, Zhang Muye, has just taken office. Due to the fact that the outgoing county magistrate, Wan Shijun, fled without resigning while the turnover of matters was still incomplete, leaving only the handover officer Gao Ya to handle the matter, he is now under surveillance, causing the turnover work to suddenly be delayed. In order to understand the situation, this reporter visited the various departments of the county government. According to detailed inquiries, in addition to the financial department receiving 1,687,000 yuan in cash, the handover of all large quantities of materials, parts, furniture, transportation equipment such as transport ships and automobiles, and the land and food departments had not been completed. The firearms and ammunition of the military department are still being counted and handed over. Furthermore, all parties are paying close attention to the cases of traitors in this county and are waiting for the new magistrate to handle them. It is reported that the former magistrate destroyed a large number of relevant documents before fleeing, causing the new magistrate to feel unable to investigate and deal with the cases.

Editorial

### Adjusting Salaries and Political Reform

The National Defense Supreme Council held a meeting the day before yesterday and passed a resolution to once again consolidate civil servant salaries. Starting in August, it will be implemented, with the base amount for Beijing and Shanghai increased to 110,000 yuan, and the multiplier increased to 720 times. According to this calculation, the salary of appointed officials will be around 200,000 yuan, and the salary of recommended officials will reach 300,000 yuan. At a time when the government's finances are extremely tight, the sudden and early adjustment of civil servant salaries is undoubtedly a most gratifying and noteworthy phenomenon in the current political landscape.

This newspaper has always been sympathetic to the meager salaries of civil servants; however, given the state of the nation's financial revenue and expenditure, we must support the government's gradual adjustment method. If we were to disregard everything and greatly increase civil servant salaries, and there were no other ways to address the financial implications, resorting only to increasing the amount of legal tender issued to make up for this increased expenditure, then inflation would worsen, and prices would rise sharply and rapidly. Not only would there be no hope of improving the lives of civil servants, but it would also trigger unrest and create financial chaos. Therefore, adjusting civil servant salaries must take into account the current state of financial revenue and expenditure. However, this time, the government has increased civil servant salaries by an average of 50%, which is a considerable sum when calculated based on the total number of civil servants nationwide. Whether this will affect national finances and prices is a matter of great concern to the people of the country. According to Premier Song of the Executive Yuan, "The state treasury is in good condition. The amount of legal tender issued has not increased in July of this year, and this adjustment will not affect national finances." At the same time, Minister Peng of the Propaganda Department also said, "Recently, in addition to the general decline in the prices of imported goods, grain prices in various provinces have generally fallen due to the autumn harvest. Therefore, raising salaries will not affect prices." From this, it can be seen that our country's finances have reached a relatively sound state, and adjusting salaries will not increase inflation, nor will it stimulate price increases. Therefore, there is indeed hope for improving the lives of civil servants in the future.

"When clothing and food are sufficient, one knows propriety and righteousness." After the lives of civil servants are stable, they will be able to work with peace of mind, which can not only improve administrative efficiency, but also curb the trend of corruption. Therefore, we can regard this salary adjustment as the starting point for political reform. When discussing Chinese politics today, everyone sees the incompatibility between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party as the current stalemate in the situation. The Communist Party's attempt to resolve political disputes by force, seize cities and territories, and establish independent regimes is indeed the root cause of all domestic warfare. However, the government should also deeply reflect on why the Communist Party, which has been abandoned by the people for its "revolutionary methods" of arson, murder, and plunder, has not weakened but has instead grown stronger over the past decade. Strategically, there is the saying "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." In political struggles, it is even more important to "know yourself and know your enemy," otherwise you will not be able to defeat your political opponents. It cannot be denied that the people are deeply concerned about the current corruption in politics because of their personal experience, and they urgently expect the government to reform politics. The idiom "yearning for governance" (喁喁望治) is probably not enough to express even a fraction of their feelings. Because the people are dissatisfied with the status quo, they are often easily exploited by ambitious people. This is also the reason for the expansion of the Communist Party's power today, which deserves introspection by our country's authorities.

The common ills of politics today are nothing more than two: First, the incompetence of those in power. Whether in central or local administrative agencies, from the responsible officials to the clerks, there are very few capable talents. There is basically no administrative efficiency. When handling official business, documents simply go around in circles, and it is unknown when they can be approved. This is certainly a long-standing habit in Chinese officialdom, but today's China is very different from the past, and we must not let it go unchecked without finding ways to improve it. Second, the prevalence of corruption. What was the political atmosphere during the Anti-Japanese War? There is no need to say more. Judging from the current situation in the political arena, almost "no official is not corrupt." Examples of this emerge almost every day. For example, yesterday's newspaper reported that a tax collector in the Hankou Municipal Direct Taxation Bureau had embezzled as much as 100 million yuan. The endless stream of such corruption cases not only arouses public resentment towards the government, but also leads to a loss of national dignity. Reforming politics must start with rectifying the administration, and to change the political atmosphere, it is especially necessary to promote integrity. There is a Chinese saying: "Military men are not afraid of death, and scholars do not want money." Although it is outdated, it still has value in today's era of rampant corruption.

Before the civil servant salaries were adjusted, although we wanted to raise this issue for discussion, we were constrained by the general public's view that "salaries are meager, how can we talk about administrative efficiency if we cannot work with peace of mind?" or "How can poor civil servants survive if they are law-abiding and do not accept illicit wealth?" We cannot expect everyone to be sages and heroes, who can sacrifice themselves for the group. Now that salaries have been adjusted, although it cannot be said to be generous, it is a small supplement to their basic lives. At a time when the government's finances are extremely tight, it still wants to adjust civil servant salaries. If they still cannot understand the government's painstaking efforts, and fail to increase administrative efficiency and eliminate corruption, then how can they be worthy of the country! And how can they be worthy of the people!

In short, the current political situation is as depressing as the weather these days; however, we believe that the future is bright, and that everything depends on human effort. Moreover, force cannot solve the problem. The political struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party does not need to be overly emphasized from the people's standpoint; what is most important is whether the government has a firm determination to reform politics. Whether the general civil servants can automatically reform themselves to create an excellent political atmosphere. If Chinese politics can emphasize administrative efficiency, then the political atmosphere will be clean and honest, and everything will be on the right track of the rule of law, then the enemy party will have no opportunity to exploit, and political struggles will not be able to be launched. Therefore, we believe that this salary adjustment is of great significance and hold great hope for it. We hope that this salary adjustment will be the starting point for political reform in our country.

### The Plenary Session of the Peace Conference Was Held Yesterday, and the Proposal for a Voting System Was Put Forward for Discussion. Molotov Demanded a Re-examination and Revision

[Reported by this newspaper] Paris, 8th: The Peace Conference convened a plenary session at 4:00 PM today (midnight Shanghai time). At the center of the semi-circular seating arrangement, Bernas and Molotov sat side by side, with the French delegation on the left and the British delegation on the right. Within five minutes, the representatives took their seats in order, but the seats in the hall were only two-thirds full. First, the method of voting was discussed. Bidault proposed using a show of hands to vote on the proposal, but Molotov stood up and said that the Rules Committee had not accepted the Soviet proposal yesterday, which was a major error. The Soviet Union opposed the majority vote of one-third agreed upon by the committee. For example, forcing other countries to accept with eleven votes over ten is unreasonable, and he requested that the plenary session re-examine and revise it. Australian representative Evatt strongly refuted this, and a fierce debate is still in progress.

[Reuters, Paris, 7th] Observers predict that after the Peace Conference enters the stage of concrete discussion, the issue of Trieste will be the most difficult. The plenary session of the Peace Conference is scheduled to be held on the afternoon of the 8th, at which time the report of the Rules Committee will be approved and invitations will be sent to the five former enemy states.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 8th] The Peace Conference held a plenary session today and adopted the rules proposed by the Rules Committee. The French Foreign Minister will serve as chairman during the first half of the meeting, and then, according to the alphabetical order, one of the five great powers will serve as chairman. According to the alphabetical order, the United Kingdom should be after France, but Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie is more likely to serve as chairman because China is at the top of the alphabetical order, and the British Chief Representative, Bevin, has not yet arrived.

### The Preparatory Stage of the Peace Conference Has Ended, and Formal Deliberations Have Begun. The Confrontation Between the Two Camps is Inevitable, Reflecting the Current Situation in Europe

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 7th] The preparatory stage of the Paris Peace Conference ended today, but the main issues of the conference itself remain unresolved. The chief representatives of the twenty-one nations of the conference spent a full eight days deciding on the conference procedures. Although the procedures originally agreed upon by the four powers were subject to intense debate for eight days, they were not significantly altered. The Rules Committee decided that non-member states could be invited by the subcommittees to attend and present their views. In terms of voting rules, the committee decided that all motions passed by a two-thirds or majority vote of the conference would be submitted to the Council of Foreign Ministers of the four powers for review. The so-called motions passed by a majority vote are, of course, of secondary importance. In addition, other amendments to the original procedures of the four powers were purely technical and insignificant. From this, it can be seen that all the representatives expended great effort and engaged in fierce verbal battles, but the results, although satisfactory, were not revolutionary, which is quite strange. It is generally believed that this is the first head-on confrontation between opposing groups. Each representative insisted on their position to the point of making mistakes, which shows that the latent forces of conflict still do not lose their ferocity in the Peace Conference. This is merely a reflection of the current situation in Europe. For example, at the meeting of the Rules Committee on the night of the 6th of this month, when discussing the two-thirds majority voting rule, the United Kingdom and France each proposed amendments that were similar in content, but the Soviet Union supported the French amendment. If the supporters of the British amendment had also supported the French proposal, then the French proposal could have been unanimously approved, but as a result, the French proposal was rejected by thirteen votes to eight, while the British amendment was adopted, but not unanimously. Some observers believe that the underlying motive for this division was to engage in a contest of wills with the Soviet delegation because the Soviet delegation, with the support of the Eastern countries, had opposed the British amendment to the end. The gap between East and West can be seen from this kind of voting. Moreover, this kind of gap exists everywhere in Europe today, especially in Austria. The development of the situation within Austria seems to be affecting the debates at the Paris Peace Conference. The disposal of former German assets within Austria is a matter on which the four powers have the most divergent views, and the Peace Conference will inevitably encounter major difficulties in this regard. For this reason, the observers were not overly enthusiastic about the agreement reached by the Procedural Committee. This agreement was in fact due to the skillful and appropriate management of the committee's chairman, Spaak.

### Truman and Byrnes Communicate by Radio

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 7th] President Truman spoke with Byrnes by radio telephone for several minutes this morning. Byrnes reported to the President on the latest developments at the Paris Peace Conference.

### Bevin Prepares to Attend the Peace Conference, Departure Date Undetermined

[Reuters, London, 8th] Authoritative sources here said this morning: Foreign Secretary Bevin still intends to go to Paris tomorrow to attend the Peace Conference, but his departure plan has not been finalized. If the consultations on the Palestine issue enter a serious state, it may be delayed for several days. In fact, because the procedural stage of the Paris Conference has ended and the draft peace treaty will begin to be discussed, Bevin is eager to go as soon as possible.

### Representatives of the Council of Foreign Ministers May Not Serve as Chairmen of the Peace Treaty Drafting Committee. Our Representative Agreed to Byrnes' Suggestion

[Central News Agency, Paris, 7th] Byrnes proposed an amendment in the Rules Committee today, which was unanimously passed by the meeting. This amendment stipulates that member states of the Council of Foreign Ministers may not serve as chairman of any peace treaty drafting committee. At the same time, if a member of a country's delegation is elected chairman of a committee, other members of that country's delegation may not be appointed as chairman of another committee. Before Byrnes' aforementioned proposal was adopted, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie spoke, expressing his full agreement with Byrnes' proposal. Wang pointed out the ambiguity of China's position, because China had attended the London Council of Five Foreign Ministers, but not the subsequent Council of Foreign Ministers. Wang declared that, under any circumstances, China was willing to waive the right to be elected chairman of the committee.

### Byrnes' Assistants Will Depart for Paris

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 8th] The American radio station announced: Republican Senator Vandenberg and Democratic Senator Connally will depart for Paris this month to assist Byrnes, head of the American delegation to the Peace Conference.

### Foreign Minister Wang Hosts a Banquet for Representatives of Various Countries and Lays a Wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier

[Central News Agency, Paris, 7th] After the meeting of the Rules Committee on the evening of the 7th, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie hosted a reception for guests from various countries at the Chinese Embassy, which was attended by 400 people. The delegations of the other twenty countries of the Peace Conference and the reporters covering the Peace Conference all received invitations. The Chinese reception was one of the few social occasions related to the Peace Conference so far. Byrnes held the first reception at the beginning of the Peace Conference. A few days later, the Yugoslav delegation issued an invitation to hold a similar reception, but it was canceled because the committee meeting on that day did not end until late at night.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 8th] Wang Shijie laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Paris this morning. Wang was accompanied to the Arc de Triomphe by Qian Tai, the Chinese ambassador to France, and several members of the Chinese delegation to the Peace Conference. He was welcomed by French General Petitjean, Paris garrison commander Lecuyer, and Dumenil, the director of protocol of the French Foreign Ministry. Wang and his party bowed to the French flag, and the military band played the national anthems of China and France. After the ceremony, the Chinese dignitaries signed the "Golden Book" as a memorial.

### Soviet Newspapers Publish the Arguments of the American and Soviet Representatives

[Reported by this newspaper] London, 8th: When the American Secretary of State refuted Molotov at the Paris Peace Conference the other day, he said that Soviet newspapers had no freedom of speech and would not publish his speech. Molotov replied that they would definitely publish it. It is reported that Byrnes' speech has been published in Moscow newspapers, occupying the third page and part of the fourth page.

### The British Imperial Defense Plan Seeks to Adapt to the New Environment. Worried About the Extension of Soviet Power into India, It Attempts to Obtain a New Position in Tibet

[Reuters, London, 8th] A reporter for the New York Times said: The British, having learned from the lessons of the atomic bomb, feel that the scale of the next war will be greater than the previous two world wars. Therefore, the defense of the empire must adapt to this new environment. This is the motivation for Chief of Staff Marshal Montgomery's tour of various places. The British are particularly sensitive to certain key points of the empire's lifeline. The deployment of the Gibraltar fortress is actually related to the British and Soviet attitudes towards the Franco regime. In the eastern Mediterranean, the British are also afraid of Soviet power extending from Trieste, Tartary, or Greece. The growth of Egyptian national consciousness forces them to abandon their strongholds in the Nile River Valley. The unrest in Palestine will affect Britain's plans to establish new bases in the Middle East. Iraq has also recently demanded to sign a new treaty with Britain, and the unrest in Iran threatens the British oilfields in Iran equally. Further afield, the Russians seem to want to extend into India via Afghanistan, so Burma will become Britain's main base in the East, and Tibet will therefore acquire a new position of importance.

### Sketches of Peace Conference Personalities: The Cannonball Diplomats Show Their Skills, Driving Away Sleepiness in the Sultry Weather

[Reuters, Paris, 8th] The sultry Luxembourg Palace is enough to make the representatives of the twenty-one countries feel very dull. If it were not for the eloquent speeches of the cannonball diplomats such as Molotov and Evatt, all the representatives would inevitably fall asleep. Evatt, known as the Australian Bevin, is one of the most active people in the Peace Conference. He often roams around the venue, looking for conversation partners. Everyone is familiar with this diplomat with broad shoulders, gray hair, and bright eyes, who always wears an ill-fitting blue suit. Evatt has given the most speeches since the Peace Conference began, and he is also the most attentive to the speeches of others. His personality is the opposite of the Belgian chairman Spaak, who has a solemn and dignified attitude, wears horn-rimmed glasses, and ties a bow tie. When the meeting is in session, he often supports one arm on the armrest of the chair, with his eyes fixed on the antique decorations on the ceiling, and sometimes he occasionally records the speeches of others, appearing very leisurely.

Molotov also appears very quiet when he is not speaking. He does not run around much, and prefers to share the "joy of the family" with his delegation. Twirling his mustache seems to be a habit he cannot change. His assistant, Ambassador to the UK Gusev, has an unfathomable face. Another assistant, Vyshinsky, is more active, but sitting next to Molotov, he seems not as active as he was at the United Nations Conference in London. Sitting opposite the Soviet delegation is Canadian Prime Minister King, wearing a pair of rimless glasses. When the interpreter is translating the speeches of others, unless it is English, he always fixes his gaze on the opposite wall. Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk is a tall and well-dressed gentleman, who speaks with a touch of humor. Sitting on the other side of the chairman is Indian representative Shia Gan, who is one of the most eye-catching in terms of clothing color, because he is wearing Indian dress. Chinese representative Wang Shijie's fluent, dignified, and cultured English draws the unanimous attention of the audience.

### Contents of the Italian Memorandum

Protests on Several Issues

[Reported by this newspaper] Paris, 8th: The Italian delegation, without waiting for the official meeting of the twenty-one nations this Saturday, launched the struggle for amendments to the treaty with the former enemy countries today, submitting a memorandum including three points to the Peace Conference, protesting the border changes and economic terms between France and Italy. Italian Prime Minister Gasperi's main goal in appealing is to maintain a gentler peace for Italy and to gain the support of Latin American countries and the sympathy of Britain and the United States. The main points of the memorandum are three: (1) A general review of all border disputes, including the promises made by de Gaulle and other senior French officials that France would never make territorial claims against Italy; (2) A request to retain the Roja River Valley (including the Tenda area) given to France by the four powers; (3) A request to retain the Mont Cenis district given to France by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the four powers.

### Britain Decides to Comprehensively Stop Illegal Jewish Immigration, Completely Blocking the Mediterranean Coast, Seeking to Eliminate a Certain Underground "Oil Pipeline"

[Reuters, New York, 8th] The British government has notified the United States that it will no longer allow illegal immigrants to enter Palestine, and that illegal immigrants will only be allowed to move to Cyprus in the future.

[United Press, London, 7th] Government sources said today: The British government is planning to comprehensively stop the illegal Jewish immigration to Palestine from Europe. As a result of cooperation between the army and navy, the Mediterranean coastline of Palestine may be completely blocked. The cabinet held a special meeting today to discuss the Palestine issue for two hours, but no decision was announced. Chief of Staff Montgomery and representatives of the army, navy, and air force all attended the meeting. According to informed sources, today's cabinet meeting will likely push forward the New York action. At the same time, it was announced in Malta yesterday that the famous British cruiser "Ajax" had sailed from the island to Haifa. It is said that the ship's movement is not related to the British blockade plan. The land-based tasks of the overall plan will be carried out in concentration camps from Italy to Germany. The British army in the area will be ordered to step up control in order to eliminate a certain underground "oil pipeline" that has been constantly transporting European Jewish refugees to Palestine.

[Reuters, London, 7th] There are a total of five Jewish refugee ships docked in Haifa, with a total of 1,500 refugees being prevented from landing. It is heard that there are two other refugee ships, carrying approximately 3,300 refugees, also en route to Haifa.

Another report states that the British army on Cyprus has set up 100 tents for housing Jews. Officials have not disclosed whether those who are to be housed are Jewish refugees or Jewish terrorists, nor when the housing will begin.

### British Cabinet Discusses the Palestine Issue

[Reuters, London, 7th] The British cabinet met for two hours this morning to discuss the Palestine issue. Well-informed sources predict that new proposals regarding Palestine will be put forward in the near future. The American government is still discussing the partition plan for Palestine in higher education. The previous rumor that President Truman expressed dissatisfaction with the plan has been formally denied by Treasury Secretary Snyder, a member of the cabinet's Palestine Committee.

### He Yingqin Attends a Secret Meeting of the Military Advisory Group

[Central News Agency, New York, 7th] General He Yingqin attended the secret meeting of the United Nations Military Advisory Group for the first time after General Shang Zhen. The group is still in the preliminary stage of secret discussions and has not made any response to the Security Council.

### My Witnesses Wang Lengzhai and Four Others Still Detained in Tokyo Awaiting Summons, Prosecutor Read Aloud the Timeline of Japanese Aggression Against China Yesterday, Records of Hata Shunroku and Matsui's Confessions Were Both Presented

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The Far East International Tribunal, in order to try key war criminals such as Tojo, specially invited incumbent military and political leaders at the time of the Japanese invasion of China, as well as witnesses or parties involved in the atrocities of the Japanese army, to testify in court. It is now known that among those invited from our country to testify, in addition to Mr. Wang Lengzhai, Liang Tingzhao, Tong Shoumin, and Chen Dashou who are still in Tokyo, Vice Minister of National Defense Qin Decun, Sun Ji, Xu Chuanyin, Xu Fanjun, Shang Deyi, Wu Changde, and Dong Fufeng have all returned to the country one after another.

[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] Former adjutant to the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Central China Expeditionary Army, Muto, testified in the International Court today that Commander Matsui was deeply concerned that after the Japanese army entered Nanjing, rape and looting would be inevitable, so he ordered that only elite troops be allowed to enter the city, but this order was not enforced. Matsui later heard that the Japanese army had indeed committed rape and looting, and he roared at his subordinates. Muto also stated that only "ten or twenty incidents" occurred in Nanjing.

[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 8th] In recent days, the prosecutors of the International Tribunal have continued to summon witnesses and present evidence, trying to prove from various aspects that Japan's military actions in China were not Japan's defensive war, but a war of aggression. Today, prosecutor Moro first read aloud the "Timeline of Japanese Military Aggression Against China," followed by the presentation of the confession record of defendant Hata Shunroku, which stated: "I succeeded General Matsui as the Commander-in-Chief of the Central China Expeditionary Army from February to November 1938, and then succeeded General Nishio as the Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army from 1941 to 1944. After Matsui captured Nanjing, I was dispatched to China with the main goal of peaceful work in the occupied areas. From 1941 to 1944, 50,000 Japanese soldiers died in China, and about 200,000 were injured. At the time of surrender, I was serving as the commander of the Second Army stationed in Hiroshima and was injured in the head by the atomic bomb, and have not fully recovered." Then, Matsui's confession record was presented, in which he flatly denied the atrocities of the Japanese army in Nanjing.

Giant Map Hanging on the Wall

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch] This morning, the Far East International Tribunal hung a giant map of our country behind the defendant's enclosure to show the various stages of Japan's aggression against our country. The nine maps of our country hanging showed the situation of battles fought on our country's territory over the years, and were marked in red to show the territory occupied by Japan in each period. All the defendants craned their necks to watch.

### US Army Secretary Patterson Flies to the Pacific Region

[United Press, San Francisco, 7th] A C-54 transport plane carrying US Army Secretary Patterson and twelve officials of the War Department flew from Washington to the Pacific region today, making a temporary stop at Hamilton Airport. According to people at the airport, the destination and mission of Mr. Patterson and others are kept secret.

### American Journalism School: The Pastoral Scenery of Missouri - Hometown of President Truman

— Special Correspondent to the United States, Mao Shuqing

[Kansas City, Yamoyue 13th Airmail] The morning business districts of the United States are concentrated in two main parts. One is along the Great Lakes, represented by the states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, and Indiana, and the other is the Mississippi River, represented by the states of Missouri, Mississippi, Texas, and Louisiana. Missouri is located between the North and South of the United States. During the Civil War, Missouri was the part of "balancing the balance." Even now, the "racial boundary" between blacks and whites in Missouri is neither as harsh as in the South nor as enlightened as in the North. Americans, especially those in the big cities of New York and Chicago, regard Missourians from "the fields" as rustic "country bumpkins." In fact, Americans in Missouri are indeed more honest, simple, and kind than in other places, and also more "country" than anywhere else. Their lifeline is agriculture.

They are content with the natural order of agricultural society. Before World War II, San Francisco once held a national American "exposition" of products. The products sent by Missouri were ears of wheat four inches long. The people in charge of the exposition and the audience all praised Missouri's agricultural products, but they also found the representatives from Missouri to be adorably rustic, so they all joked with him. The representative from New York: "What's so rare about your four-inch-long ears of wheat? We have six-inch-long ones in New York!" This was a joke, but the "country representative" believed it to be true. He followed the representative from New York and shouted, "Show me!" The representative from California found it really funny and interjected, "What's so great about six inches long? In California, eight-inch-long ears of wheat are nothing!" The Missouri representative immediately held out his hand and said, "Show me!" Now, "Show me!" has become a general nickname for Missourians.

Whether in the army or in international metropolises, when Americans meet Americans, after asking their names, if one side says "Missourian," the other side will naturally say "Show me!", just like saying "old hen" when seeing someone from Hefei in China. Missourians are not ashamed of being ridiculed by others. They can never change their simple and kind nature. On the contrary, they feel it is necessary to preserve this kind of nature. Historically, the state of Missouri has never had "earth-shattering" political figures. This time, Truman became the current president, and Missourians were unprecedentedly happy, but their simple personality often pushed their reason. Many Chinese students study at the University of Missouri. When asked what their local classmates thought of Truman becoming president, almost all the students were consistent. They believed that "Harry (Truman's nickname) is an honest person, but not very suitable to be president." On my way from St. Louis to Kansas City, I stayed overnight in the small town of Columbia. In the hotel and on the road, I asked them if they knew President Truman? They all said as if they were very close: "Oh, Harry, we know him, he is a good man!" Missourians believe this is the success of their honest society. Anyone who has been to Missouri, whether a visitor from another place or a foreigner, looking at their peaceful agricultural society, looking at their fertile fields and fragrant rice, you will definitely feel the loveliness of this pastoral life. In Missouri, prices are half as cheap as in New York. A few friends who study journalism at the University of Missouri can rent a bright and clean comfortable upper room for less than twenty dollars a month, and have their meals at the old lady next door for five and a half dollars a week, eating large pieces of pork or beef every day. This kind of cheap life is unimaginable for people accustomed to living in New York and Chicago. Missouri's agricultural society is rich thanks to the irrigation of the rivers. The Mississippi River is in the east, and the Missouri River runs through the entire state. Although the entire state of Missouri is full of hills, the slopes and valleys have become the best producing areas for crops. Once the car leaves St. Louis City and goes straight west along National Highway 40, it is all undulating hilly terrain. After driving more than 130 miles, you will reach Columbia. Columbia is not the capital of Missouri. The capital of Missouri is in Jefferson City, 31 miles south of Columbia. Because it is not on a major transportation route, and I heard that the capital is pitifully small, I did not go sightseeing. Columbia gets its name entirely from the University of Missouri. The entire city has only 18,000 residents. Including the students of the University of Missouri, there are only about 30,000 people. The current president of the University of Missouri, Mr. Middlebush, is a famous political economist in the United States, but the University of Missouri is not famous for political economy, but for the School of Journalism and Agriculture. The School of Journalism occupies two buildings. The basement of Neff Hall is the typesetting room and printing room; the second floor is the dean's office, editing and defense department; and the third floor is the advertising room and showroom. The basement of Williams Hall is the photography studio; the second floor is the editorial office, business office, and typing practice room; and the third floor is the library of the School of Journalism. I only visited the School of Journalism at the University of Missouri for three hours, but based on my personal feelings, I think the success of journalism education at the University of Missouri is entirely due to the integration of theory and practice. The School of Journalism runs the only daily newspaper "The Missourian" in this small city, with specially set up printing rooms, and specially hired printing workers from outside. Students take turns writing editorials, editing news, and reporting news. What they write, edit, and report is published in their own newspaper every day. Clipping and compiling them becomes the grade for the semester. The University of Missouri also teaches journalism theory and "History of Journalism." The current dean, Mr. Mott, is a eloquent speaker of theory. I did not meet Dean Mott. Associate Director Sharpe talked to me about many anecdotes of Chinese students at the Missouri School of Journalism. Many former Chinese students are now seniors or well-known figures in the Chinese news industry. In the reception room on the second floor of the School of Journalism, I saw the couplet that Mr. Wang Yingbin gave to the "alma mater" of Missouri, the mirror frame that Mr. Shao Yuanchong wrote to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the School of Journalism, and the screen couplet that Mr. Kong Yongzhi wrote to the School of Journalism in the name of the President of Yenching University. The East Row room of the School of Journalism displays many ancient paintings related to the news industry in the East. The "Pass" issued by the Jiangsu Governor's Office to Klaus, a reporter for the Shanghai Continental Daily, on January 6th of the Republic of China, allowing him to go to various cities to interview news and "enter and exit the city gates," is hung on the wall. It is said that this pass was personally approved by the Provisional President Sun Yat-sen. In addition, the souvenirs given by the Japanese to the Missouri School of Journalism are very numerous. Viscount Shibusawa of Japan has photos and poems inscribed on them, and Fumio Kuno, the chairman of the Tokyo Mita Journalism Society, also has a piece of writing hanging in the showroom.

### The Business Community Places Great Hopes! The Petition Group Went to the Capital Last Night, Hoping the Government Would Seize the Opportunity to Provide Emergency Relief Quickly, All Industries Held a Tea Party Yesterday Afternoon to See Them Off

[Report from this Newspaper] A group of forty-seven members of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Petition Group, jointly initiated by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Branch of the National Industrial Association, led by five general representatives, Wu Yun-chu, Jin Run-xiang, Shou Liang-wei, Ge Jie-chen, and Yang Guan-bei, took the evening train to the capital last night at ten o'clock. They are scheduled to stay in the capital for three days and will petition separately to seven agencies: the National Government, the Standing Committee of the Central Party Headquarters, the Supreme National Defense Council, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Finance.

Nearly Fifty Members Participated

Yesterday afternoon at four o'clock, the various trade associations of the City Chamber of Commerce held a special tea party in the Chamber's meeting hall to see off the members of the petition group. About one hundred people attended, including various members, representatives of various trade associations, and reporters from various newspapers. Mr. Zhu Shangyi gave a speech first, stating briefly that the industrial and commercial sectors have now reached a critical juncture of life and death. The success or failure of this petition trip is related to the success or failure of the entire industrial and commercial sectors. He hoped that all members would work hard to request the authorities to accept the opinions of the industrial and commercial sectors to rescue them from the depths of misery. Then, Mr. Yan Esheng, Secretary-General of the Chamber of Commerce, reported on the preparations for the petition group and stated that as of now, forty-seven members have participated. The petition group also asked Mr. Tao Guilin to go to the capital three days ago to deploy everything. It is also heard that representatives from the chambers of commerce in Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, and Wuxi will gather in the capital today.

The Main Points of the Petition Each Have Four Points

As for the main points of the petition, the Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association each have four points. In addition to a separate submission from each, the Chamber of Commerce also has a joint submission. Each trade association also has a submission, and six have been received so far. In addition to appointing Wu Yun-chu and four others as general representatives to the outside world, Mr. Tian Heqing and Wang Jianping have been appointed as general directors internally. In addition, they are expected to return to Shanghai on the 11th. After Mr. Yan finished his speech, Mr. Tian Heqing, representing the Industrial Association, reported on the four major principles of the association's petition this time: (1) Expedite emergency industrial loans. According to statistics, 30 of the 45 industrial associations in this city intend to apply for loans, and the amount of loans requested reaches more than 156 billion yuan. Including the 13 associations that have not yet sent letters, the estimated amount of loans will exceed 200 billion yuan. (2) Coordinate labor-management disputes: (A) Implement the minimum wage law, (B) Safeguard the administrative management rights of factories, (C) Factories have the freedom to shut down. (3) Industrial rehabilitation: Ensure that all factories are rehabilitated uniformly, and priority should be given to purchasing enemy and puppet factory production tools and intact raw materials. (4) Industrial subsidies: (A) Implement a tax refund policy, (B) Allocate raw materials, power, and transportation tools at low prices.

Luo Qinghua Arrived Despite Being Ill

At 5:30, Chairman Luo Qinghua arrived at the meeting place despite being ill and gave a speech on the spot, stating briefly: "I am very sorry that I cannot accompany the petition group due to my illness. The petition group's action was decided at the general meeting of all members of the Chamber of Commerce on the 23rd of last month. This trip is of historical significance, with an unprecedented task and a significant and urgent meaning. The crisis in the industrial and commercial sectors is getting worse every day, and factories are closing down every day. We cannot ignore this situation. After the rehabilitation, I have been in contact with the government authorities and the industrial and commercial sectors. Government officials are not unaware of the industrial and commercial crisis a month ago. There are roughly two views: First, it is believed that the current crisis is caused by the country's participation in the eight-year war of resistance, which has severely damaged its economic capacity. Therefore, the crisis is due to natural causes and cannot be remedied by human power. The main response is to wait for the solution of political problems, and then the economy can gradually recover. Therefore, all efforts are focused on tightening credit, in the hope that as a result of tightening, fiscal revenue and expenditure can be balanced. Therefore, industrial loans are tight, industrial production is shrinking accordingly, materials are becoming scarcer, and currency is increasing, resulting in the opposite effect, and the gap between revenue and expenditure is widening. On the other hand, it is believed that there are two destinations for currency: those used for production and construction should be expanded as much as possible, and those used for ordinary consumers should be tightened. The government's various necessary and huge expenditures, such as civil servants' new allowances, may consider replacing some with in-kind. If policies are implemented according to this principle, it is hoped that a true balance of revenue and expenditure can be achieved. However, these two arguments have not yet been coordinated. Therefore, the industrial and commercial sectors, as a third party who has experienced the situation, should now have something to say. The problem of political consultation at the current stage has a feeling that it is impossible to talk about. The crisis in the economic and industrial and commercial sectors is approaching day by day. If it collapses, what will happen to the country and social order? Therefore, it is deeply hoped that the government authorities will adopt a determination to save lives rather than save the dead for the industrial and commercial sectors. It is now known that the number of people in the government who sympathize with the situation of the industrial and commercial sectors is increasing day by day. The industrial and commercial sectors should give full support to this sympathy. Therefore, it is hoped that the petition group will earnestly and concisely present two points to the government on this trip: (1) The problem has reached the most serious stage, (2) The time has come to the final moment. If the government fails to seize the opportunity to provide emergency relief, the entire industrial and commercial sectors will be in an irretrievable situation. In the past, the government lacked a comprehensive economic policy and only had an erroneous fiscal policy, which led the monetary policy to go astray. This petition trip should urge the government to change the past erroneous policies to correct policies. Therefore, this trip is of historical significance. At the same time, the motives of the petition group are pure, and the purpose is to address the matter, not the people. And absolutely support the government, hoping that the government will quickly resolve the current difficulties of the industrial and commercial sectors." Finally, Shou Jingwei, Pan Shihao, Ma Shaoquan, and others made separate statements, and the meeting ended at 6:30.

Full List

It has been reported that Wu Ouchu, Jin Runxiang, Shou Jingwei, Ge Jiechen, and Yang Guanbei are the five general representatives, Tian Heqing and Wang Jianping are in charge of internal affairs, and the list of the remaining thirty-nine people is as follows: Pan Shihao, Tu Kaiwei, Cai Xintao, Xu Ziwei, Tao Guilin, Yan Esheng, Jiang Jiabao, Han Zhicheng, Huang Nongtang, You Kanyuan, Ye Shichang, Liang Songling, Zhang Shanqiu, Kuang Fengshao, Wu Xingcha, Shen Jien, Wang Bingjun, Guo Zifu, Zhu Xiaofang, Fang Runlin, Song Baolin, Tong Shengyu, Zhou Songchang, Yao Yuen, Zhong Keto, Zhong Shanguo, Chen Laiguo, Shen Fengshi, Wu Daming, Yuan Xiaolian, Sun Yujun, Xie Xing, Wu Zhijun.

### A Major Fire at Dayouyu Oil Factory, Losses Exceed 600 Million Yuan

[Report from this Newspaper] The Dayouyu Oil Factory at No. 36 West Suzhou River Road in Shanghai's West End is large in scale. Yesterday afternoon at 4:50, a fire suddenly broke out in the factory's old workshop due to a short circuit. At that time, the wind was very strong, and the fire spread very quickly, affecting the L.G. cargo warehouses on the west side. One warehouse stored 80,000 sacks, and another warehouse stored 5,000 bags of soybeans and 3,000 bags of cottonseed, all of which were burned down. When the fire was raging, the Yichang Road Fire Department and the Central District and other fire departments arrived one after another to connect water and put out the fire. Unfortunately, the fire was already strong, and the sacks, soybeans, cottonseed, oil, and other items stored inside the warehouse were all flammable, so it was not easy to extinguish. It was not until 9:30 in the evening that the fire gradually subsided, but the embers were still there. Even until 2 o'clock this morning, the fire truck had not left to prevent the embers from rekindling. Afterwards, according to the factory manager Xue Runsheng, the total losses exceeded 600 million yuan, and some machinery was also burned down, but the goods were insured for a huge amount in Tianyi Taiping and other insurance companies.

Another report: The paper warehouse on the second floor of Xu Shengji Printing Factory at No. 175 Hart Road was also burned down at 5:04 yesterday afternoon.

### The Case of Returning Materials to Capital Factories, the Investigation Team is Currently Investigating

[Report from this Newspaper] The reporter recently visited Wu Wangji, a member of the Receival and Investigation Team, to inquire about the case of Sun Tianchangzhi, a Korean arms dealer, mentioned in yesterday's newspaper. According to him, the investigation team is conducting an investigation into this case. Before the entire case is decided, they are unwilling to express any opinions. However, this case is of great importance, and it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan if necessary. As for this type of case, the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau and the Review Committee should be responsible, at least for the delay. However, the investigation team is determined to proceed with the handling as soon as possible. Another report: There have been many criticisms from various parties regarding the situation of the receiving office of the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui area. The Executive Yuan has instructed them to submit a detailed report for verification. It is heard that the office has complied with the order to submit a report.

### The Chongqing Labor Association Incident: Zhu Xuefan Reports the Course of Events, Makes Four Appeals to All Sectors to Uphold Justice

[Our Newspaper Report] Due to the Chongqing office of the China Labor Association, and several welfare organizations such as the hospital run by the Association in Chongqing, being forcibly occupied by over two hundred plainclothes personnel and armed police officers on the morning of the 8th of this month, with over twenty staff members of the Association detained, a reception for reporters from various newspapers in the city was held yesterday afternoon. Firstly, Mr. Zhu Xuefan of the Association reported, stating briefly that the Association had been established for ten years, and after moving to Shanghai in February this year, due to practical needs, various undertakings run in Chongqing, such as the workers' welfare agency, labor hospital, nursery, worker cultural service team, and worker schools (eight in total), were continued. Unexpectedly, at around 6:00 AM on August 6th, over two hundred plainclothes personnel and armed police forcibly occupied these institutions and the Chongqing office of the Association simultaneously. At that time, traffic was cut off, the situation was serious, and over twenty staff members of the Association were detained. Patients in the labor hospital were also not allowed to leave. These armed personnel claimed to be acting on orders, and the fact that these several organizations, which were quite far apart, were occupied simultaneously indicated that this was not something that could be done by a small number of people, but a planned action.

About two weeks before this incident, the "Labor Voice" newspaper, run by Deng Faqing, a director of the Chongqing General Labor Union, published news falsely accusing the Labor Association of plotting an assassination group. However, upon investigation, the person in charge of the Association in Chongqing, the director of the Ciyou Orphanage, Ms. Zhou Ying, is a graduate of the Central Political School, and the director of the Labor Hospital, Dr. Zhao Suyuan, is a student who studied in Canada and is a Christian. Both are resolutely not involved in political activities or plotting to incite labor unrest.

Mr. Zhu continued: Not only has the Association never incited labor unrest, but it has also made every effort to assist the government in resolving labor disputes. For example, in August of last year, it assisted in resolving seven labor disputes, twenty-nine in September, thirty-six in October, thirty-seven in November, thirty-eight in December, seventeen in January of this year, and eighteen in February (after March, it moved to Shanghai). As for the handling of donations, not only have the accounts been thoroughly audited by the Lixin and Gongxin accounting firms, but the use of funds at ordinary times must also be approved by the US labor community relief fund supervisory committee. All account books are available for review. The Association is a legal organization that has assisted in the war of resistance for ten years, promoted increased production, and strived to improve the status of workers. Today, it has suffered this unexpected blow. Therefore, it appeals to all sectors to uphold justice and puts forward four demands: (1) Request the release of the detained personnel of the Association; (2) Investigate the instigators of this incident; (3) Request the government to protect human rights, ensure the safety of staff, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future; (4) Demand that those who forcibly occupy these institutions withdraw immediately.

Subsequently, Mr. Zhang Yuanshan, a representative of the US labor community relief fund supervisory committee, stated that the committee is a supervisory body in name and in fact. After the relief fund arrives in China, it is first deposited with the supervisory committee. When the Labor Association uses funds, it must first prepare a budget, which must be approved by the committee and then transferred to the United States for approval by the donating organization before it can be issued. If the Labor Association's use of funds is not related to worker welfare and the war of resistance, the supervisory committee will naturally not consider it. The Labor Association's accounts are now all stored in the supervisory committee. This spring, the accounts were also published in the newspaper once, and there is indeed nothing unaccountable for.

In response to reporters' inquiries, Mr. Zhu Xuefan stated that the Chongqing workers have no faith in the "General Labor Union" responsible by Deng Faqing and others, and have formed their own labor unions and joined the Labor Association. He himself will go to Nanjing this week to appeal to the authorities.

### The Rong Family's Two Brothers Are Accused of Embezzlement: Shenxin Capital Stock Causes Entanglements

[Our Newspaper Report] Rong Erren, the son of Rong Desheng, and his nephew Rong Hongyuan (son of Rong Zongjing), have recently been sued by Ding Ziren from Wuxi for embezzlement. The case was heard in the fourth criminal court of the local court yesterday. It is reported that Ding and the Rong family were originally relatives. In the eighth year of the Republic (1919), they jointly took over the Hengchangyuan Yarn Factory on Yichang Road and renamed it Shenxin No. 2 Factory. At that time, the total capital was 500,000, with Ding holding 100,000. Ding also served as general manager. Later, due to old age and weakness, he handed over the position of general manager to Rong Hongyuan, and Rong Erren took over as manager. Now, Ding accuses the Rong brothers of gradually transferring Ding's capital stock to their own accounts after taking over. At the beginning of the partnership, because they were relatives, there was no written agreement, only a note in the capital account. However, the capital account has been hidden, it is said. Yesterday, Ding himself did not appear, but entrusted a lawyer to appear in court. The two defendants also did not appear. According to the lawyer representing them, Rong Erren is currently in the United States, and Rong Hongyuan was unable to attend due to business. The case may be settled out of court, and the court is requested to postpone the hearing. The case was therefore adjourned for another hearing.

### Zhao Meibo and Others Return to Shanghai: Music Community Hosts Tea Party to Welcome Them

[Our Newspaper Report] Amidst the vigorous development of the Shanghai music movement, dozens of famous musicians who had participated in the war of resistance in the interior, including Zhao Meibo, Liu Xue'an, and Wu Bochao, have returned to Shanghai one after another. The Shanghai Music Association held a welcome tea party at the Nanyang Garden yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, chaired by Ding Shande. Huang Yuanyin and Ma Sihong, members of the music visiting delegation who recently visited Nanjing, were also present. (It is noted that the visiting delegation is about to depart for Southeast Asia and the United States.) It was the first grand gathering of the Shanghai music community after the victory, with famous musicians from home and abroad gathered together. Director Xu of the Municipal Government Symphony Orchestra also reported on the orchestra's recent situation at the end of the meeting, and the entire audience applauded after the speech. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.

### Yuan Ludeng Interrogated Continuously: Investigating How Much Property He Has

[Our Newspaper Report] Yuan Ludeng, one of the "Three Elders" of Shanghai, has been sentenced to life imprisonment, and his family has applied to the Supreme Court for a retrial. However, there has been no referral for a new hearing to date. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, Yuan was brought from prison because the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau requested the High Court to investigate Yuan's property. Judge Qiu Huan-ying opened the hearing at 4:30 PM, asking only about the shares of the Huacheng Tobacco Company and the Red Cotton Restaurant. Yuan stated: "I have forty shares in the Huacheng Tobacco Company, each share worth ten yuan. Dai Gengxin is the chairman of the board, and I serve as a consultant in name. I have 10,000 yuan in shares in the Red Cotton Restaurant, which were gifted shares. I was also elected as a director, and Sheng Pihua is the chairman." The interrogation ended in less than ten minutes, and he was escorted back to prison by the bailiffs. Also, the day before yesterday morning, Yuan was once again brought from prison for questioning about the shares of the Nanjing Central Hotel. Yuan replied that he had transferred them to others several years ago.

### A Group of Bloodless Demons: Assisted Japanese Enemies in Various Behind-the-Scenes Espionage Activities: Twenty-Three German War Criminals Scheduled to Stand Trial Starting on the 15th

[Our Newspaper Report] Twenty-three German war criminals have been prosecuted by the US Military Judiciary and are scheduled to formally stand trial between the 15th and 20th of this month.

According to the US military's investigation, the activities of the German Fifth Column in China began long before the outbreak of the Pacific War. These Fifth Columns concealed their true faces under the guise of merchants and diplomatic envoys. Because although the Germans had previously helped China train its army, when the opportunity arose to find an ally in the Far East, they chose Japan. However, the Germans were also very cunning. They also considered the possibility of China's ultimate victory, so they decided to remain ostensibly friends of China, while secretly agreeing with the Japanese to help Japan with despicable behind-the-scenes activities to harm China. Formally, they did not fire a single shot at the Chinese, but in reality, they caused even greater damage to China. The bombing of the wartime capital Chongqing was the result of these "trusted" Germans who traveled between Chongqing and Shanghai. They told the Japanese in detail about Chongqing's air defense facilities. It can be said that Chongqing's becoming the most severely bombed city in the world was mainly due to their contribution.

Behind-the-Scenes Activities to Probe Military Intelligence

This kind of behind-the-scenes espionage activity reached a new climax after Ayssener arrived in China in 1942. Ayssener, also known as Ohard, the first criminal now being prosecuted, had previously engaged in Fifth Column work in the Balkans and achieved remarkable results. After arriving in China, he first appeared as a businessman, and then as a member of the Shanghai Embassy, actually serving as the head of the "Ohard Bureau." Under his leadership, the main persons in charge of the North China branch were Verchler and Hiesch, whose tasks were: (1) to collect information related to the US military landing in China, (2) to report on the Chinese government's intelligence and political and military trends, and to provide them to the Japanese through the Embassy and Headquarters in Shanghai, (3) to report on the intelligence of Yan'an and the political and military trends of the Chinese Communist Party, (4) to report on the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, the supply of materials, air and sea transportation, and military trends. In addition to this, there were four secondary goals: (1) the actions of the US Air Force in North China, (2) the activities of the US naval fleet, (3) the relationship between Chongqing and Yan'an, (4) the supply situation of the Chinese army through the Xi'an line, (5) the supply situation of Free China through the Lanzhou line.

### Key Criminal Hess Was Originally a Military Advisor

As for the intelligence provided by the Ohard Bureau to the Japanese in Shanghai and other places, it included the routes of the US air transport team and the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) for transporting supplies, the movement of troops, the location of guerrillas, the movements of the US fleet and escorts, and the location of Allied warships injured in the war zone. In addition, under the command of the German naval attaché in Tokyo, the Ohard Bureau colluded with the Embassy, commercial institutions, and the German-China Bank in China to smuggle tungsten ore, currency, and other important materials to supply the Nazi war machine.

And when the Japanese repeatedly attempted to negotiate peace with China in the later stages of the war but failed, they planned to divide China province by province, starting with Guangxi, then Yunnan, and then Sichuan. The Ohard Bureau also fulfilled the role of "intermediary" in the implementation of this conspiracy. Hess, one of the key war criminals, had been serving as a military advisor to China for many years and knew many Guangxi generals. He voluntarily offered to take on this task, and in fact, he did carry it out, but the conspiracy ultimately failed due to the loyalty and firmness of the people he contacted.

After Germany surrendered, they continued to engage in this destructive work. They desperately hoped that rifts would occur among the United Nations and that Japan would achieve final victory. From diplomatic personnel to businessmen, they contributed all their strength and materials to assist Japan until Japan surrendered.

US Military Court's Indictment

Now, from Ohard to the twenty-three war criminals, large and small, have been imprisoned in the Tilanqiao Prison awaiting trial. The main text of the US Military Judiciary's indictment against them is as follows: "Between May 8 and August 15, 1945, when the United States and Japan were still at war, Germans residing in China, including Ayssener (alias Ohard), Sieberg, Gericke, etc., respectively, in their capacity as German officials, nationals, citizens, spies, and employees, continued to engage in conscious and purposeful military activities that were illegally detrimental to the United States and its allies, undermining Germany's unconditional surrender.

### Scramble for Wharf Materials Leads to Armed Clash Between Dockworkers

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday morning at 7:30 AM at the second wharf of the China Merchants Bureau at the Outer Hongqiao area, over two hundred new and old dockworkers gathered, each armed with iron rulers and clubs, resulting in an armed clash. When both sides were engaged in a chaotic battle, police officers dispatched by the military police arrived to suppress and halt the fighting, but to no avail.

### Prison Life Is Good? Establishing a Painting and Calligraphy Society, Organizing a Club: Yuan Ludeng Relaxes, Claims It's a Rare Opportunity for Quiet Recuperation

By chance, this reporter had a several-minute conversation with Yuan Ludeng, one of the "Three Elders of Shanghai," who is sixty-seven years old.

Like most elderly people in the summer, he was wearing a white silk long gown, black cloth shoes, and holding a folding fan with calligraphy and painting.

When asked about his thoughts on being sentenced to life imprisonment, he smiled wryly and remained silent for a long time. Later, he suddenly told the reporter that a month ago, several friends had submitted a petition to the Supreme Court on his behalf, and the Ningbo Association had also made a request. He sighed softly and ended with the phrase, "Everyone will understand in the future," seeming to express regret for the "lack of understanding" from the outside world.

The topic turned to Wen Lanting's refusal to leave prison for trial. He said that Wen Lanting had stated in court during the first investigation hearing at the High Prosecutor's Office that he would no longer appear in court and that a judgment could be made in absentia. He still maintains this position. If they insist on dragging him to court, he will not answer a single question in court. Some time ago, Wen Lanting was suffering from a toothache, so his health was not good. Now that his tooth has been extracted, he has recovered in the past few days.

The reporter asked if there was a dentist in the prison. He replied that they have everything. Zhou Bangyan (general manager of Sino-Western Da Changfang) and former "Health Bureau Chiefs" Yuan Junchang and Yuan Jufan are all there, down to barbers and chiropodists.

"It's like a quiet recuperation, this is also a rare opportunity," he seemed to be consoling himself, saying that in the past, he was busy with everything, with many engagements every day, rushing to four or five places for dinner, drinking yellow wine here and beer there. Fortunately, my body is good, so I never see a doctor, this is God's blessing.

Wen Lanting Chants Scriptures and Meditates, Lin Kanghou Reads and Writes

Prison life is quite comfortable. Everyone has their own room. Wen Lanting now chants scriptures and meditates every day. Lin Kanghou reads and writes, also very leisurely. Although Liang Hongsheng has been sentenced to death, he is very calm. He is now busy writing and painting. Cai Pei and Xu Jidun and others have even gathered more than twenty people to establish a painting and calligraphy society and are now planning to organize a club.

He finally talked about his experience of entering prison, saying that on September 27th of last year, someone came to his house and said that Mr. Dai wanted to talk to him. Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, and others were already there, so he went with them to Yuyuan Road. He didn't see Mr. Dai there. At that time, Wen Lanting stated that he would not take a drop of water. After some explanation, everyone stayed there. Later, they moved to Fulvli Road, and then some people moved to the South City. During this period, he only saw Mr. Dai once. Soon after, he was taken here.

The reporter asked if he read newspapers in prison. He shook his head and answered directly and frankly, "I don't read a single newspaper, I don't want to read them."

A photographer ran over to take a picture of him. He sat up straight and said to the photographer, "You can take it. There are many pictures of me outside, even signed ones."

### Li Jinxi to Take Over as Head of the Editorial Office of the Chinese Grand Dictionary

[Report from Our Newspaper in Beiping] According to Li Jinxi, President of the National Northwestern Normal College and Standing Committee Member of the Ministry of Education's Mandarin Promotion Committee, he will be the Chief Director of the Editorial Office of the Chinese Grand Dictionary. Currently, he will not return to the Northwest this year to focus on the takeover and restoration work of the office. The affairs of the National Northwestern Normal College in Lanzhou are being handled by Secretary Yi Jia as his representative.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th] The Editorial Office of the Chinese Grand Dictionary was established in July 1928 by order of the Ministry of Education and was affiliated with the Ministry of Education's Mandarin Promotion Committee (formerly the Mandarin Unification Preparatory Committee). The government allocated the four western courtyards of Juren Hall in Zhongnanhai, Beiping, as the office's location. In July 1937, with the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, the Mandarin Promotion Committee moved inland with the government. The office, due to the large amount of materials and books, was unable to move to the rear and was thus suspended. In 1938, the puppet "Provisional Government" established a puppet "Ministry of Education." To put on a show, it forcibly took over the National Peiping Library, the Palace Museum, the Historical Exhibition Hall, and the office under its direct control. It also arbitrarily changed the office's name, deleting the character "Grand" and changing it to the "Chinese Dictionary Editorial Office." Because the number of staff remaining in the office was very small and their role was mainly custodial, the enemy and puppet authorities did not pay close attention. The office's index cards and books were thus fortunately preserved.

The City Government previously received an official letter from the Ministry of Interior stating that the city's production methods had been previously circulated for review, and the matters to be handled this year were to be earnestly carried out. This newspaper has already reported on this matter. It is now learned that the City Government yesterday issued an order to all district offices, stating that the production committees in all districts should be organized according to local conditions in accordance with laws and regulations, and that the production plans and implementation progress should be submitted to the district people's representative assembly for approval and reported to the government for review by the ministry.

### Second District National Education Association Holds Inaugural Meeting

Sixteenth District Promotes People's Education

The Sixteenth District Office, in conjunction with the Sixteenth District Central National School, invited more than 40 chiefs of each Bao and heads of public and private primary and secondary schools in the district to a meeting at the Central National School at 170 Tanggu Road yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to discuss the implementation of People's Education.

### Bao Officers in All Districts Temporarily Limited to Males

Currently Serving Female Officers Transferred to District Service

The Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government considers Bao officers to be the backbone of local self-government, with complex affairs and heavy responsibilities. The regulations stipulate that only one full-time officer be assigned to each Bao office in the city. If personnel are not selected who are physically strong, mentally vigorous, and able to endure hardship, it will not be sufficient to cope with the situation. Due to physiological and physical reasons, women are not suitable for this position. It is now specifically stipulated that (1) the appointment of Bao officers in all districts is temporarily limited to males, and (2) currently serving female Bao officers should be transferred to district office clerk positions as soon as possible to emphasize local self-government.

### Answers to Questions Regarding Household Registration Laws and Regulations (Continued)

(III) Personal Registration Category

(40) Question: In the folk custom, it is common to marry child brides. If they are registered as adopted daughters according to law, there are many disputes among the people. How should this be resolved?

Answer: Child brides should still be registered as adopted daughters according to law, and it should be noted in the remarks column that "planning to marry a certain son in the future." They should also be informed that on the day of consummation, they should apply for marriage registration again.

(41) Question: Registering child brides as adopted daughters seems to imply marriage between people with the same surname, which harms good social customs. Can it be changed to "foster care" registration?

Answer: Child bride is not a legal term, but it is a constant in custom. To determine their status, it can be handled by analogy with the adoption relationship. According to Article 1078 of the Civil Code, adopted children take the surname of the adopter. After consummation, the adoption relationship ends, and they should legally revert to their original surname. At the same time, according to Article 1000 of the Civil Code, they can be given the husband's surname or follow their agreement to marry with the same surname, which is not prohibited by law. And when the adoption relationship ends, the previous father-daughter or mother-daughter status no longer exists, and it does not harm good social customs, so there is no need to change it to "foster care" registration.

(42) Question: The investigation and filling in of the cause of death is quite difficult before the general establishment of health agencies. How should it be handled?

Answer: Regarding the investigation and filling in of the cause of death, according to the provisions of Article 9, Paragraph 3 of the Revised Implementation Rules of the Household Registration Law, the local health agency should provide the necessary assistance. If there is a health agency in the area, the cause of death should still be filled in in detail. Where it has not been established, the classification of death causes such as illness, suicide, and execution can be adopted, which is easier to investigate and fill in, and conforms to the facts.

### Veterans Shall Not Be Forced to Solicit Donations

The Municipal Government recently reported that the Rongyu (Veteran) soldier Guan Fusheng and others were forcing door-to-door donations. After sending personnel to investigate the details, the Municipal Government specifically issued an order to all district offices, stating: "The central government has established regulations for the preferential treatment of veteran soldiers. The certificate issued by this government to Guan Fusheng and others is to prove the identity of veteran soldiers, so that the Baojia organizations can provide preferential treatment in terms of accommodation and transportation. If Jie Wenli and others solicit donations from house to house, it is inappropriate. It is also inappropriate for the Baojia chiefs to accompany them."

### Twenty-Fifth District Distributes Flour Today

The Twenty-Fifth District (Xin Jing) District Office convened a relief meeting of all Bao chiefs on the 5th to discuss the procedures for distributing flour.

### High Costs and Sluggish Sales - The Dyeing and Printing Industry is in Distress - Indigo Dyes in Black Market Worth 20 Million Yuan

[Our Newspaper News] According to insiders in the dyeing and printing industry, in addition to facing the same pressure from high-interest loans and high wages as general industries, the dyeing industry is also experiencing a shortage of dyes, especially the non-fading Indigo dyes. It is reported that in the past few months, the Liquidation Department of the Defu Foreign Firm in this city still had a considerable amount of Indigo dyes for distribution. Although it cannot be said to be a large amount, it was still useful. Recently, the amount of distribution has gradually decreased, and there are rumors of shortages. The current distribution price of Indigo dyes is about 10 million yuan per burden. However, the black market price is around 20 million yuan, which greatly affects production costs. Although the United States also has substitutes such as Baoshailin, the output is not high. Orders placed in the first half of this year have not arrived yet. It is said that orders will not be accepted for the second half of the year. The shortage of dyes has become a considerable threat. If large-scale production resumes, this problem will become even more serious.

Currently, the sales of dyeing and printing industry products are sluggish due to the unrestored order and transportation obstacles in various regions, except for Guangbang, which has slightly improved. On the one hand, the dyeing and printing factories affiliated to the China Textile Construction Corporation also have a considerable amount of products, which are supplied to the market at low prices, so the product prices are also very flat. It is reported that currently, except for the printing business, which can still make a small profit, the dyeing business mostly loses money. Therefore, factories that rely solely on dyeing are complaining incessantly. Taking the common 190 Shilin cloth as an example, the market price is 80,000 yuan per bolt. The price of the grey cloth alone accounts for 52,000 yuan. The process from grey cloth to Shilin cloth takes an average of about two weeks. The labor, fuel, interest, transportation, sales, and management costs per bolt of dyed cloth are definitely not enough to be covered by 28,000 yuan. However, most factories currently have the pain of wanting to stop but being unable to do so. Because workers cannot be dismissed, they are forced to start work in order to maintain the livelihoods of their employees.

Furthermore, according to some manufacturers, the South Pacific region has excellent sales for various colored cloths and floral cloths, as the seasons are summer all year round, and the prices are also more reasonable than in China. However, due to the unrestored transportation in various regions of China, the customers from various regions cannot come to Shanghai to purchase, resulting in sluggish sales and falling market prices. On the other hand, production costs are increasing, making it necessary for dyeing and printing factories to reduce production. In this distressing situation, striving for the South Pacific market for yarn and cloth and increasing exports to stimulate production in various factories seems to be a win-win solution.

### Gold Notes Stable, Hong Kong Dollars in Strong Demand

Gold prices were very stable yesterday, but the number of transactions was even lower, and the fluctuations were narrow. The morning opened at 1.918 million, and there was still strong demand from outside the industry. After opening, it rose to 1.935 million.

Private money lending turned flat, and supply and demand were balanced. Private interest rates ranged from one corner to one corner and two cents.

### The Trend of Chinese Stocks is Uncertain

Although Chinese stocks wanted to advance, large investors did not have any activities and lacked encouragement. In addition, Meiya gave up at the close, affecting the overall situation, and the overall trend became uncertain again. Yong Yarn was raised from 700 yuan to 720 yuan, while Meiya fell from 4,230 yuan back to 3,950 yuan. San Xiao was the most popular in the middle of the hot streak, but opened and closed weakly. The futures market was one level lower than the spot market, which shows that people have no intention of pushing up prices. The futures interest rate was also reduced to one corner and five cents and one corner and a half. There was not much activity in the market except that Mr. Tong bought 560,000 shares of Yong Yarn. The result was a slight increase for Yong Yarn and a slight decrease for Meiya compared to the previous closing price. Jingfu and Xinguang each fell by 2 yuan, Qin Xing was still flat, the unpopular mid-sized stocks were flat and weak, and the small stocks continued to rise due to the early closing.

However, the large stocks were temporarily weak, and the small stocks were still stable. The result was a slight decrease for Yisha, British United, Wheelock, and Asia compared to the previous closing price. Gangye rose slightly, and Yibei Paper, Yeguang Shangping were flat.

### The Bond Market is Full of Red Tickets

It is difficult to expect public bonds to be revived. Operators are suppressing red tickets, and those who settle are scrambling to resolve them, so the proliferation is even worse. Buyers are wary. Tongbing fell from 660 yuan in the morning to 620 yuan before seeing stabilization. The result was a decrease of 50 yuan compared to the previous Muzha. Jia and Yi also fell by 20 yuan, Ding fell by 30 yuan, and E declined by 10 yuan.

### Small Denomination Notes Shall Not Be Refused

Recently, a few banks and money shops in the market have refused to accept 50 yuan and 100 yuan notes on the grounds of being worthless. This matter concerns the entire financial system and the credit of legal tender. The Ministry of Finance has telegraphed the Shanghai Banking Industry Association to accept the notes as usual without discrimination. The Shanghai Social and Financial Bureaus will also jointly issue a notice, ordering all banks, money shops, and other industries to comply.

### Rice Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday, a total of 4,000 to 5,000 shi of rice arrived in the northern and southern rice markets. Due to high production prices and impassable transportation, most vendors lost money. Therefore, the source of new goods was scarce. Retail sales in stores moved slightly, and japonica and indica rice continued to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The arrival of new japonica rice was also small, rising by more than 1,000 yuan. Flour was sold off one after another in foreign sales, and people's confidence was shaken, causing a sharp drop of 400 to 500 yuan. The arrival of new soybeans continued, and the market was still sluggish. High-quality goods were still reluctantly standing, while medium and low-quality goods continued to decline. Old soybeans also softened with it. There were not many raw peanuts arriving, and the market was temporarily stable. There was a slight arrival of Qingdao oil in the oil market. The supply of soybean oil from the factory continued, falling by 1,000 yuan, forming a situation of fluctuating up and down, making it difficult to predict. The digestion of soybean cakes continued to be weak, and the price fell by 300 to 400 yuan.

### Flour is Still Prohibited from Exporting

The Shanghai Flour Industry Association previously submitted a request to the Municipal Government to forward it to the Ministry of Food, requesting the cancellation of the ban. It is learned that the Municipal Government has received a reply from the Ministry of Food, stating that the food supply for Shanghai citizens has not yet emerged from the emergency period, and flour should still be prohibited from re-export. The Municipal Government has ordered the Municipal Social Bureau and the Bean and Rice Industry to notify that, except for those reported by the General Administration and the Ministry of Food, any other agency or individual is still not allowed to report and re-export flour.

### Three Banks and Two Bureaus Obey the Order Not to Participate in the Preparatory Meeting

[Nanjing, 8th] The Fourth Joint Office held its 315th board meeting at 10:00 AM on August 8th. All directors attended. Minister Yu Hongjun served as the chairman.

### Yarn Market is Quiet, Floral Cloth Sales are Lively

The yarn market was still lifeless yesterday, and sales to customers were sluggish. Transactions were extremely light. The fluctuations of 20-count yarn were very strong. 42-count yarn decreased by about 20,000 to 30,000. Sales among peers were also lacking. With the hot weather, the opening was very late, and the closing was advanced. People's confidence was quiet, and the trend was still very depressed.

Yesterday, the New York US cotton telegraph rose by 16 to 23 pounds. The recent US dollar was 34.50, the new flower futures was 31.43, and the Mitlin spot was 35.30. Spot cotton trading in this port continued to be smooth. Shenxin Second and Tongyi, Xinsheng, Anda, Datong and other yarn factories all purchased, and the market price rose frequently by 1,000 to 2,000.

Sales of medium-grade grey cloth increased sharply. Because Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang and other places have strong demand for raw colored cloth, dyeing factories and trading houses have rushed to search, so the situation is lively. Private factories such as Fugui, Dapeng, and China Southern have purchased particularly quickly. Recently, grey cloth has improved, fortunately, the Textile Construction Corporation is still supplying, and the market is still flat. However, Biji is still tired due to sufficient chips. At noon, Textile Construction Corporation sold fine cloth as usual, only 500 to 600 yuan higher. Biji did not move, and the rest were also similar to the last time.

### Artificial Silk Rises Again

Yesterday, artificial silk suddenly rose sharply. 120-count Tianqiao bright spot goods opened at only 1.515 million yuan, and in a blink of an eye, it made 530,000 yuan. The transaction was very frequent among peers, and finally made 550,000 yuan to close.

### Four Recommendations to Save the Tea Industry from the Current Urgent Crisis

The China Tea Industry Association, considering the current tea industry crisis imminent and urgently requiring the government to take effective measures to rescue it, drafted a summary of key points through various businesses in the same industry. They publicly elected representatives to go to the capital, Beijing, to request relief from the government. The main points are as follows:

(1) Request the government to provide tea export subsidies: The Indian government, due to British tea prices being lower than cost, implemented tea export subsidies of up to nine pence per pound. The United States also implemented cotton export subsidies. Therefore, it is proposed to request the government to implement export subsidies.

(2) Request the government to continue tea barter trade: In the early stages of the Anti-Japanese War, the government used tea to barter with the Soviet Union and airlifted it to the United States to support sales in North Africa, achieving considerable success. Now that tea exports have stagnated, it is imperative to resume barter trade with the Soviet Union. In addition, barter trade can be carried out based on the needs of various countries, such as French North Africa needing Chinese tea, and the French government could be asked to exchange it for Annamese rice.

(3) Request the government to use economic diplomacy to expand the Chinese tea market: An investigation reveals that the tariffs of some countries have unfavorable provisions for Chinese tea. For example, the United Kingdom restricts the import quantity of Chinese tea to 2.5 million pounds this year. The United States sets a very low price limit for Chinese tea. Furthermore, in French Morocco, the largest market for Chinese green tea, the French government has issued an order prohibiting the import of Chinese tea. It is proposed to request the government to negotiate with the relevant countries through diplomatic channels to eliminate the above-mentioned restrictions.

(4) Request the government to continue to provide tea loans and extend the principal repayment date of tea loans: This year, in order to support the tea industry in Southeast China, the government designated the Central Farmer's Bank to provide tea loans of 7 billion yuan, with a deadline of three months. Currently, it is difficult to expand exports temporarily. It is proposed to request the government to extend the principal repayment date. In addition, tea merchants feel that the interest burden is too heavy due to the lower profits from export trade this year. It is proposed to request the government to specifically approve a reduction in tea loan interest rates. Furthermore, the production of packaged tea still relies on the government's continued provision of refined processing loans. As for brick tea produced in Hunan and Hubei provinces, which amounts to more than 500,000 dan per year and is related to barter trade with the Soviet Union, it is also proposed to request prompt approval for loans.

### Increased Tobacco Leaf Production in Shandong

This Year Could Reach 100,000 Pounds

It is reported that the tobacco leaf harvest in Shandong, Henan, and other places this year is estimated to reach 100,025,000 pounds, which is still less than the pre-war production, but it exceeds last year's production by more than two times.

### Reduction of Reserve Requirements No Longer a Problem, Rediscount Still Under Consideration

Recently, the financial industry has been eagerly hoping that the Central Bank will promptly implement rediscounting. According to a person in charge of the bank: the issue of rediscounting is still under careful consideration because the bills in the Shanghai market are extremely complex, and it is not easy to distinguish between productive and non-productive uses. The purpose of rediscounting is to maintain legitimate productive enterprises. If it is transferred to speculative purposes after implementation, it will instead inflate credit and stimulate prices. However, the bank has already started handling re-pledging of export drafts, and manufacturers in various places can pledge re-export and export goods to the three banks and two residential associations. The silver and money industries currently have a joint reserve association, which is sufficient for turnover among peers. If the association's capabilities are still insufficient, the bank will naturally come forward to maintain it. Regarding the reduction of reserve requirements, the person in charge said: It is being discussed with the Ministry of Finance, and there is no problem with reducing reserve requirements. However, the exact amount of the reduction has not yet been decided.

### Mayor Wu on Vegetables and Pork: No Price Increases Allowed

Recently, vegetable and pork prices have been rising without end. The municipal government specifically summoned the directors of the vegetable and fresh pork industries yesterday afternoon, including Zhang Shouren of the vegetable industry and Xin Xiaokang of the fresh pork industry. Mayor Wu personally met with them and first inquired about the reasons for the recent price increases in the two industries. He explained the municipal government's determination to thoroughly suppress prices. After the representatives presented detailed statements separately, Mayor Wu instructed the two industry associations to quickly and voluntarily lower prices and report on transportation and sales conditions at any time. If the associations encounter difficulties beyond their capabilities, he will do his best to assist them. If anyone in the industry engages in illegal behavior such as manipulating and monopolizing the market, they will be severely punished according to law. He hopes that those in charge of the associations will pay special attention and avoid regrets. The representatives of the respective industries all expressed that they would notify all members to comply.

### Jiao Tong Bank's Zhao Dihua Suggests Establishing a Rejuvenation Industrial Corporation to Regulate Long-Term Industrial Funds

Zhao Dihua, General Manager of Jiao Tong Bank, advocated the organization of an investment company last year. Recently, China's industry has fallen into an increasingly depressed state. Zhao reiterated this proposal, and people in the financial community generally believe that such an organization is indispensable to solve the current industrial crisis. A "Rejuvenation China Industrial Finance Corporation" has been planned, with capital set at US$500 million and 5 billion yuan in national currency, to be subscribed by national banks, commercial banks, companies, insurance companies, etc. Its central business is for various industrial and mining enterprises to order foreign machinery and materials and may request the company to handle it on their behalf. The company will collect 10% to 30% of the deposit according to its credit rating and the nature of the machinery and materials purchased, issue letters of credit, or negotiate with foreign countries for installment payments or investments. When the machinery and materials ordered on behalf of the client arrive, the original client who requested the order should, in principle, pay in full or in installments according to the contract provisions. If they are unable to do so, the company may lend or advance funds depending on the situation. New industrial and mining enterprises that lack funds may request the company to raise funds on their behalf, or provide loans to them, or the company may negotiate investments or long-term loans with foreign companies on their behalf. For all guarantees made by the company to foreign industrial and mining companies and investments, and the financial sector, the company also plans to request the government to provide comprehensive and unconditional guarantees to foreign governments and people to enhance the company's credit abroad. With the establishment of credit abroad, if the environment is suitable, it may negotiate with foreign countries to issue foreign currency industrial bonds in foreign financial or securities markets. It is also known that the company, in order to meet the needs of various industrial and mining enterprises for domestic long-term funds, and taking into account the scarcity of domestic capital, may accept bonds issued by factories and mines according to the actual needs of factories and mines, or use factory land as collateral to provide long-term national currency funds. Zhao said that the United States had the organization of a "Reconstruction Finance Corporation" after the agricultural panic in 1930. After the end of this war, the United Kingdom also established an "Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation". At this critical juncture, we should catch up quickly and hope that colleagues in the financial sector will cooperate and organize quickly to save the industrial crisis.

### Reinsurance Business Gradually Developing: The Central Trust Bureau Allocates Huge Funds to Expand Efforts to Achieve the Goal of International Mutual Insurance

[This newspaper dispatch] The underwriting of reinsurance business has become an extremely important position in today's insurance business. Yesterday, the reporter made a special trip to the Central Trust Bureau's Property Insurance Department to inquire about the underwriting of reinsurance business. It is reported that in the autumn of last year, when the war was still protracted, the prices of various properties were soaring day by day. Insurance companies, with their limited financial resources, were unable to underwrite properties with excessive prices. Even if they underwrote, they would all allocate a portion of the insured amount to foreign insurance companies for reinsurance. Therefore, the consumption of foreign exchange funds was quite large. In view of this, the Ministry of Finance entrusted the Central Trust Bureau to start the reinsurance business on September 4 last year, in addition to its original ordinary insurance business. The purpose is to enable private businesses to obtain actual benefits from this. At the same time, it can save the consumption of foreign exchange. The initial capital of the Bureau for handling reinsurance was 1 billion yuan. Later, due to the increasing development of the business, it was increased to 5 billion yuan in April of this year. From September of last year to the end of June of this year, the amount of reinsurance underwritten by various companies has reached more than 148 billion yuan. The scope of the above-mentioned turnover only refers to Shanghai and Chongqing. In order to facilitate insurance companies in other ports, the Bureau has started handling reinsurance business in its Guangzhou, Hankou, Qingdao, and Tianjin branches from August 1st.

It was also discussed that the insurance business originally has international characteristics. According to the principles of insurance science, the more dispersed the insured amount, the lower the capital borne by each company and the smaller the risk. From the perspective of domestic reinsurance, the principle should be mutual benefit. However, according to the current situation in China, most of the reinsurance is distributed by domestic insurance companies to foreign companies, and few are distributed from foreign countries to domestic companies. The trend is purely one-sided. Therefore, it is hoped that the Bureau's handling of reinsurance business can play a leading role and unite the collective strength of domestic insurance companies to exchange reinsurance with foreign insurance companies in order to truly achieve the goal of international mutual benefit in the insurance business.

### The Textile Construction Company Says There is No Problem with Cotton Supply, but There is a Cotton Cloth Price Hike

According to news from Washington recently, the price of American cotton will increase immediately, and some people advocate that cotton should be temporarily banned from export before prices are adjusted. A person in charge of the Textile Construction Company explained in detail that even if the price of American cotton increases immediately in the short term, it will have no impact on our country. The reasons are: (1) The price of cotton ordered by our government from the United States has already been stated and agreed upon in the order, and cannot be increased or decreased. (2) The domestic cotton production situation has greatly improved. Therefore, even if American cotton disappears, it will not cause any panic. At least this year, there will be no shortage of American cotton shipments to China. In addition, UNRRA also imports large quantities of cotton from time to time, and the price is similar to the fixed price.

There is no basis for the cotton cloth price hike

Regarding the recent sudden price hike in the cotton cloth market, he explained that this is because cotton cloth merchants heard this information and believed that cotton cloth exports would create a state of supply and demand imbalance, so they competed to purchase it. This trend may subside immediately, as cotton cloth from Zhongfang will be supplied continuously and will not be hit by the export policy. The spokesperson declined to make a positive statement on whether domestically produced cotton cloth can be exported in the shortest possible time.

### Casual Notes from Mount Lu

—Special Correspondent Xie Baozhu Reporting by Air on the 2nd

Nine years ago, when Chairman Chiang was on Mount Lu, he entrusted two precious items, a jade photo and a longevity peach, commemorating his fiftieth birthday, to Wu, the former head of the Mount Lu American School for safekeeping. After eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, these two precious items were finally intact and were returned to Chairman Chiang and his wife yesterday. The jade bear was made of porcelain and Chairman Chiang was wearing a general's uniform. The longevity peach was also exactly the same and was placed in two high-footed glass cups, which were in a glass box that was about a foot long, eight inches high, and three inches wide.

Ambassador Stuart, on this trip to the mountain, fell ill due to overwork and climate changes. However, he had a strong sense of responsibility, knowing that hundreds of millions of Chinese people, and even people from various countries, were looking up to him, waiting for him to bring good news. This illness really worried him. The doctor insisted that he lie down all day. He became anxious and said to his secretary: "It's really annoying! Everyone is busy working, and I'm the only one lying in bed resting. How can I face others? How can I face myself? ...The doctor says I can't see guests or talk for three days. Can you please get me another doctor?"

Admiral Cooke, commander of the US Seventh Fleet, and his wife and children came to the mountain on August 1. Director-General Huang Renlin explained to Mrs. Cooke that the Haohan Slope (Hero's Slope) here is more than 900 steps high, so it is said that if someone can walk up it, they are a "hero". Mrs. Cooke said, "I would very much like to be a 'hero', but they won't give me the opportunity."

The postmen of Guling are quite dashing. On rainy days, you can see them holding an umbrella in one hand and a mailbag in the other, strolling slowly under the green shade, while singing loudly, making people feel a sense of "Tao Yuanming as a breeze."

The only basketball team in Guling is the "Weizhong Team", organized by the attendants of Chairman Chiang's residence. The team has been quite active recently and has won two out of two finals against the temporary basketball team of the summer camp. In order to reward all the team members, Chief Guard Yu Jishi is hosting a banquet tonight to cheer them on. The team members are not arrogant after winning and continue to work hard every day to maintain the "throne" forever.

### A Glimpse of Longhua Airport, Shanghai's Only Commercial Airport

— Written by Zhang Yinhuai, Photographer Tingpeng, This Newspaper Reporter

People are paying attention to the state of Longhua Airport, Shanghai's only commercial airport. The uneven runway, the dust flying everywhere, the tight and cramped airport, and the lack of hangars are huge obstacles to business expansion. The improvement work should be the urgent task at hand.

When a twin-engine passenger plane roared along the 5,000-foot runway, the wheels bumped forward on the uneven gravel road, dragging up a cloud of smoke-like dust. The Beijing saying "Three feet of soil without wind, mud filling the streets with rain" also applies here. The reporter recently inspected Longhua Airport and overlooked it from the air, resulting in the above impression.

More Than 50 Passenger and Training Aircraft

At 11:25 AM on the 2nd, the reporter and others took off on a China National Aviation Corporation C.46 twin-engine passenger plane. As soon as we left the ground, we saw the crowded airport. Looking down at the runway under the wing, on the left are the hangars of China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation, and on the right is the Dahua Aviation Corporation, which is being planned. Around the hangars, various sizes of passenger planes and training planes were parked, totaling about 50 or more.

The 5,000-foot runway, viewed from 500 feet in the air, is a yellowish-brown color. It runs roughly north-south, parallel to the Huangpu River. As the plane gradually climbed to a height of 650 feet, I felt smooth and stable in the plane. Even when there were some slight bumps, it felt like sitting on a Simmons bed, with an elastic and soft feeling. The reporter naturally thought of the jumping and bumping of the plane on the runway during takeoff, and couldn't help but marvel at it!

In the Early Days of Aviation, There Were Only Stinson Aircraft

Twenty years ago, Longhua Airport was just an army parade ground for the Military Commission. In 1929, China National Aviation Corporation delineated a piece of flat land there, built a few houses, and bought a few small Stinson-style passenger planes. This was the beginning of China's civil aviation industry. At that time, they had no telecommunications equipment, no sky contact, and no meteorological stations. As for the runway, it was only 600 to 800 meters long. It is said that they chose the location on the Huangpu River to facilitate the takeoff and landing of seaplanes.

The Expansion of the Eurasian Aviation Company's Site

Two years later, the Sino-German joint venture Eurasian Aviation Corporation was established. The site was expanded a bit, and the runway was lengthened to 1,200 meters. At that time, the aircraft were, at most, a few DC-2 twin-engine passenger planes, each carrying only 16 passengers, which is clearly a small feat compared to the current situation where each engine carries 40 to 50 passengers.

On August 13, the flames of war spread to Shanghai, and Longhua Airport fell into the hands of the Japanese invaders. The airport itself underwent unprecedented expansion. Although no new hangars were added, the runway was extended to more than 5,000 meters, and the airport space, which could originally only accommodate more than a dozen aircraft, was expanded to accommodate more than a hundred heavy bombers. Several auxiliary runways running east-west were also added. Longhua Airport already had the prototype of an airport, at least it had the conditions to develop into a commercial airport.

Business Booms After the Two Companies' Return

After the victory, China National Aviation Corporation moved back to Shanghai, and Eurasian Aviation Corporation was reorganized successfully when China declared war on Germany. The Central Air Transport Corporation, which was wholly state-owned and under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation, moved back to Shanghai for business before Christmas last year.

Both companies purchased many US military C-46 and C-47 surplus aircraft. At the same time, due to the government's active rehabilitation efforts, people flocked to Shanghai, and business presented an unprecedented boom.

Under the close cooperation of the two companies, there is also a take-off and landing control tower at the airport. Each company also has its own telecommunications station to communicate with the air or directly report to aviation stations in various places. The main routes have been expanded to six, with the farthest reaching Xi'an and Lanzhou. In the southwest, the routes extend to Kunming and may extend to Bangkok, Vietnam. The Hong Kong route may extend to the Philippines.

A Huge Obstacle Has Not Yet Been Overcome Satisfactorily

However, the rapidly growing civil aviation industry has always had one major obstacle that it has been unable to overcome. That is to say, Shanghai lacks a suitable airport.

Among the five airports in Shanghai, Jiangwan may be more suitable than Longhua, but Longhua is the civil airport designated by the Aviation Commission. In present-day China, where military aviation also needs to catch up quickly, commercial institutions seem unable to look at the vast site of Jiangwan Airport and the smooth and wide runway and vainly hope to get their hands on it. Although the two companies at Longhua Airport are doing their best to make partial improvements to provide a comfortable environment for passengers taking off or landing, this is irrelevant.

First, the unevenness of the runway has also increased the company's own burden of repairing aircraft wheels. Second, there is a lack of hangars, and 50 to 60 precious aircraft are left to be exposed to the rain and sun in the open air. The lifespan of the aircraft may be reduced as a result.

The Municipal Government Has Financial Difficulties and Cannot Afford to Build an Airport

Improving the civil airport is of course the responsibility of the municipal authorities, but when the municipal government's administrative expenses are insufficient to cover its expenditures, it is clearly out of the question to build an airport. Since the municipal government has no funds, it seems that it does not intend to invest in this difficult matter for the time being (naturally, this is only temporary). Long ago, during the war, the municipal government charged airlines a percentage of the total revenue from passenger tickets as tax. Today, this can only be temporarily put aside.

Several Experts Have Been Hired to Study Improvement Plans

It is reported that the airline has hired several experts to study the improvement of Longhua Airport to make it a modern airport. It is said that the content of the plan is roughly divided into two points, and the details have not yet reached the time for publication. Of course, they are extremely willing to wait until the issue of the airport management rights is clarified before discussing the improvement plan, so that rights and obligations can have a more reasonable decision.

The issue of land ownership at Longhua Airport is also a complex matter, like tangled hair. In this area, due to the evolution of the past 20 years, it is not easy to determine who owns the property rights. Among them, in addition to the privately owned land that was acquired by the government, the Aviation Commission and the Ministry of Transportation each have a part of it. Today, the municipal government is planning to collect information in order to sort out and resolve this outstanding issue.

### The Problem of Excretion in Shanghai

— Cui Liushan

The term "excretion" in physiology has a broad meaning, but this article will only refer to the excretion of feces.

The excretion of feces is unavoidable for everyone every day. If not properly handled after excretion, it can affect life, especially in densely populated large cities. The amount of feces produced is enormous, and whether it is handled properly or not is of utmost importance. Therefore, feces, similar to garbage disposal, is one of the important issues in municipal administration. Feces are disgusting and dangerous. Feces contain a large amount of organic matter. Once this organic matter decomposes, it produces foul gas. At temperatures of 15 to 20 degrees Celsius, one cubic meter of feces can generate 18 cubic meters of foul gas in 24 hours. Its composition is roughly: (1) 10 cubic meters of volatile fatty acids and hydrocarbons, (2) 6 cubic meters of carbon monoxide, (3) 2 cubic meters of ammonia. This gas can cause mental discomfort, vomiting, reduced appetite, or even direct poisoning. One cubic centimeter of feces contains 381 million microorganisms. One cubic centimeter of urine contains 200 million microorganisms. Not all of these microorganisms are harmful, but if the feces come from a sick body, they often contain a large number of pathogens. For example, the feces of patients with typhoid fever, cholera, and dysentery are full of pathogens. These diseases often spread through feces. In addition, there are various parasites such as roundworms, hookworms, pinworms, whipworms, lung flukes, liver flukes, trichinella, and ginger flukes. Their eggs are scattered in excrement and urine, and are also transmitted through feces.

This alone is enough to show how disgusting and terrifying feces can be. Now let's calculate how much feces there is in the entire city of Shanghai. According to Pettenkofer, one person excretes 34 kilograms of feces and 400 kilograms of urine per year. Based on this, Shanghai's 3.4 million people produce 115,600 tons of feces and 1,360,000 tons of urine per year, totaling 1,475,600 tons, averaging 4,040 tons per day. According to the past French Concession's usage of manure carts, with each three carts roughly equaling one ton, Shanghai should transport 12,120 carts of feces per day. If such a large amount of waste is not handled properly, it can cause great distress, or even lead to great disasters.

Steps for Handling Feces

Handling feces can usually be divided into the following steps: one is temporary storage, two is collection and transportation, and three is utilization or destruction. Before discussing each item separately, there are two points that need to be explained.

First, the most ideal way to handle feces is to use flush toilets, which are built-in flushing devices. This type of device minimizes the time feces are exposed to the air after defecation. Dirt does not accumulate, odors are not emitted, and they are transported directly underground to the final disposal site. Even without the natural disinfection of septic tanks, there is absolutely no chance for pathogens to escape, so it is the most hygienic. However, the architecture in Shanghai is still very backward, and most houses do not have this type of device. It is estimated that only one-sixth of the city's feces are handled in this way. In places where sewage pipes are installed, many are damaged, causing fecal water to overflow. The responsibility for repairs is shirked between landlords and tenants, resulting in filth all over the ground, which becomes a problem for environmental hygiene.

Second, feces can be used as fertilizer because their chemical composition includes nitrogen, potassium, and phosphates, which can enrich the soil. Chinese agriculture is traditionally heavily reliant on feces. According to the former Jiangsu Provincial Bureau of Entomology, the value of feces used nationwide in one year was 20 million yuan, which, according to the current currency value, is more than 80 billion yuan. So from another point of view, this thing is also a "treasure." The feces produced in Shanghai are still being sold by the cart and boat, with a considerable income. Farmers in the surrounding countryside use it as fertilizer, and it can be said that they cannot do without it. Under these circumstances, the storage of feces, the transportation of feces, and the period of feces utilization should be handled strictly in accordance with public health conditions.

Installation of Public Latrines

Now let's talk about storage first. The sanitary conditions for storage require, first, preventing flies from gathering and breeding as much as possible; second, minimizing the emission of odors. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to choose appropriate locations, arrange appropriate facilities, use appropriate containers, and the most important point is to clean frequently. As for the storage methods, the ones used in Shanghai today are nothing more than the following two types: chamber pots are mostly used privately, and pit latrines are mostly used publicly.

The installation of public latrines is certainly very important in such a large city. However, considering the urban area, Shanghai has only 225 public latrines, averaging one public latrine per 0.42 square kilometers. Considering the frequent movement of citizens and the lack of sanitary facilities in general households, this number is really not enough. In the past, the Bureau of Health decided to add 200 public latrines by selecting suitable locations. During Mayor Qian's tenure, recognizing the urgency of this facility, he allocated 100 million yuan for the construction of public latrines. If this plan is completed, there will be one public latrine per 0.22 square kilometers in the urban area. The addition of public latrines not only facilitates citizens' excretion, but is also necessary for maintaining cleanliness.

However, there are many problems with public latrines. If the location is not chosen well, the result may not only be unhelpful to hygiene, but also harmful to hygiene. Secondly, the construction of public latrines is a problem, and management is also a problem. In the urban area of Shanghai, there are currently 225 public latrines, of which 120 are set up by the municipal authorities. Most of them have flushing devices, and sanitary conditions are also taken into account in terms of location and construction, such as good designs for air circulation and wastewater discharge. But the situation is different for those set up privately. The purpose of private individuals setting up public latrines is to collect feces for profit. They do not pay attention to construction, nor do they pay attention to cleaning. Often, feces and urine are all over the ground, making it impossible to set foot in them. The chamber pots are full of filth, and in the summer, flies gather and maggots spread. They are not only disgusting and unbearable, but also extremely dangerous. These toilets must be banned, or at least ordered to be improved, to avoid being a source of disaster.

I think that the establishment of public latrines by private individuals should be encouraged in principle, because there are not enough public latrines now, and the government cannot add so many in a short time. However, the selection of locations, the design of buildings, etc. must be strictly reviewed by the government, and at the same time, attention should be paid to management in the same way as public pit latrines.

Managing public latrines requires diligent cleaning and attention to killing maggots and flies. In addition, there is also a business of selling toilet paper in Shanghai's public latrines. Because the capital is small and the profit is high, many people compete to contract for it. Others believe that those who operate this business take too high a profit and advocate restricting or abolishing it. I personally think that abolishing it is the best; if it cannot be abolished for the time being, its price should also be limited, so that things that are intended for convenience do not end up having the drawback of exploitation.

The Problem of Feces Collection and Transportation

Secondly, in terms of transportation, the same attention should be paid as in storage; especially the transportation vehicles such as carts and ships should be tightly sealed to prevent feces from being arbitrarily exposed. Regarding the management of collection and transportation, the feces in the urban area of Shanghai, until the collapse of the puppet government last year, have always been contracted by merchants. The government collected "cleaning fees" monthly according to the contract. The contracted merchants sent dung collectors to pull carts to collect feces from each household, transport them to the dung wharf, sell them to dung transport merchants, and then the merchants distributed them to nearby areas.

The contracting of feces transportation, according to the situation at the time of the collapse of the puppet government, was divided into several regions: Pudong, Wusong, and Xu Cao each formed one region, and the old concession, Zhabei (including Jiangwan), Nanshi, and Hu Xi (excluding Xu Cao) formed one region. The latter region had the widest working area and the largest scope of business, accounting for more than 80% of the total amount cleared daily. This region averages 6,500 carts of feces per day, with each cart weighing about 0.32 tons, totaling 2,080 tons. Its contract price in September last year was 101,786,000 yuan in puppet currency, equivalent to 508,930 yuan in legal currency. All the dung collectors were paid by the contractors in the form of profit sharing; the tools they used (dung carts), some were owned by the contractors themselves, and some were placed by the government and lent to the contractors for use. In the past, the Public Concession authorities placed a large number of dung carts, of which more than 900 remain to this day. Contractors own about 1,200 carts, totaling about 2,000 carts.

Most of the dung carts are damaged. Therefore, when pushing and pulling them through the city, feces often drip and splash on the road. In the past, the Bureau of Health actively supervised the repairs, but they could not be completely repaired, mostly because the cart bodies were too old and new carts had to be added to solve the problem. This is problem one.

Dung collectors originally had a fixed time for transporting feces. Later, due to lax management, or because dung dumping started later, or because there was a large amount of feces and few dung carts, the result was that even at noon, dung carts were still seen rolling through the downtown area. In the past, the Bureau of Health stipulated that the collection of feces on major streets must be completed before 8 o'clock, and other more remote areas were limited to collecting carts before 10 o'clock. But in fact, some dung collectors still cannot do it according to the regulations. This is problem two.

Dung collectors charge households a tip every month for dumping feces. During the New Year and holidays, there are also so-called bonuses, which have become ingrained and almost unbreakable. These tips increase with the increase in prices. During the New Year and holidays, they often extort huge amounts, and households cannot bear the demands, so there are many complaints. This kind of malpractice certainly needs to be reformed, but reform cannot be done with just one piece of paper or one order. There must be a comprehensive plan. This is problem three.

In Shanghai, dumping feces has become a special occupation. Dung collectors are linked together to form a gang, and each person occupies a traditional section, which cannot be violated by others. For example, if A dumps feces on this street, A can pass it on to his children or sell it to others, but no one else is allowed to send another person to share the work. If the work is heavy and assistants are needed, he will hire them himself; if others rashly join, not only will the original occupant of that section not allow it, but the entire industry will not recognize it. Colleagues echo each other, and often threaten the general residents and the contractors who manage the business with strikes and transport strikes. This is problem four.

Some of these problems are related to funding and personnel, and most are related to the entire system. I have always been skeptical of the contracting system. After assuming responsibility for environmental sanitation work in Shanghai, I discovered many malpractices of this system from all aspects. Finally, I came to the conclusion that if we want to do a good job in handling feces in Shanghai, we must start by reforming the contractor system. (Continued on page nine)

### Two Things About Road Repair

Recently, this newspaper received two letters from readers, both related to road construction. We immediately forwarded the letters to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works for inquiry. We have now received a reply; both letters are recorded as follows;

Careless Repair of Hu-Min Road Editor: The section of Hu-Min Highway from Caohejing to Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Middle School was repaired by the Allied forces after the victory, because the school housed a concentration camp for British and American expatriates, and the Allied forces sent a grader to repair it for the convenience of visiting relatives and friends. The work took about 20 days, and the road surface was smooth, like an asphalt road. People passing by were amazed at the greatness of mechanical power. However, the road surface is now damaged again. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works sent a grader to repair it, but the work only lasted for two or three days, and then it was completed, but the road surface is still uneven and full of gravel. People passing by all say: The same machinery is used to repair the road, but the results are different. The Chinese will never do it well. (Shi Fan)

Demolition of Road Built with Donated Funds Editor: The sidewalk at the entrance of our alley is dilapidated after years of disrepair. It is uneven, and rainwater accumulates after rain. After being exposed to sunlight, the smell is foul. Recently, enthusiastic people initiated donations to build the road, and everyone agreed, so they hired workers to repair it. Unexpectedly, as soon as the work was completed, several workers appeared, intending to demolish it by hand. At that time, residents asked why they were demolishing it, and they replied that you had not obtained permission from the Bureau of Public Works and could not build it without authorization. A few days later, the demolition workers came with official documents and police, and were led by a senior official. After the residents pleaded, they agreed to postpone the execution, and immediately requested the Bureau of Public Works for approval, so that it would not have to be demolished. The next day, the demolition workers came again, claiming that the order issued by the bureau could not be withdrawn and had to be executed, so they completely destroyed the road surface and left. May I ask why is this so? (A resident of Lane 4689, Weishou Road)

Reply from the Municipal Bureau of Public Works

(1) After investigation, Caohejing to Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Middle School is a section of the Hu-Min Highway. The road has not yet been assigned to the jurisdiction of this city, and this bureau has never sent workers to repair it. Mr. Tong's statement that the Municipal Bureau of Public Works sent a grader to repair it must be a misunderstanding. (2) After investigation, the interim measures for project management by this bureau have long been approved and promulgated. According to Article 2 of the measures, if public roads and sidewalks in public alleys are damaged, it should be reported to this bureau for restoration. If the damage is caused by various private facilities, the restoration project should also be applied for by this bureau and not handled independently. The residents of Lane 4689, Changshou Road, did not follow the regulations and report the application to this bureau, and repaired it on their own. After this bureau noticed, the 13th engineering section sent personnel to notify them to complete the formalities, but they delayed in doing so. After all, whether the sidewalk was damaged due to years of disrepair, it is no longer possible to prove afterwards, and the engineering standards of private construction are difficult to match with the regulations of this bureau. The engineering section sent workers to demolish it according to the provisions of Article 8 of the measures, and it was handled in accordance with the regulations. I hope that citizens will pay attention to it in the future to avoid misunderstandings.

### Talent Selection in Taiwan

— Our newspaper's July 18th airmail dispatch, special correspondent Jiang Muyun

The personnel policy of Taiwan Province is to support compatriots so that they can take responsibility for managing the administration of Taiwan Province. The authorities are doing this, but some people still believe that officials at the director level have not been appointed from among the Taiwanese, and are dissatisfied with the authorities. In fact, the authorities have their own difficulties, because the Taiwanese are not yet able to complete the task.

Chief Chen specifically raised this issue at a certain gathering, saying:

"We must all pay attention to building first-class administrative talents for Taiwan's construction. In Taiwan, such excellent talents can naturally be discovered as long as we sincerely seek them. Those who are highly intelligent, broad-minded and ambitious should be given opportunities to serve as deputy directors. If the director goes to Beijing, they can also go together, so that they can not only understand the actual situation in the province, but also understand the national political situation. In a few years, the first-class talents of this province can be cultivated successfully." He continued, "If we do not sincerely and earnestly strive to support them, the people of this province will never be able to become first-class officials. If we were from this province, we would also feel dissatisfied."

For general institutions, he strongly advocated using more technical personnel and fewer administrative personnel. He said, "If a large number of ordinary civil servants are invited to Taiwan again, the finances cannot bear this heavy pressure!"

### Understanding Our Compatriots of the Highlands

The compatriots of the highlands scattered within Taiwan Province were strictly managed by the Japanese and given rations of daily necessities before the victory. After the victory, they regained their freedom and enjoyed human rights. However, this freedom and right is insignificant to the 130,000 indigenous people who have not received modern education and are located in remote mountainous corners. They are grateful for the small favors of the Japanese, but never thought of being grateful for being given freedom and equality.

In the past six months, this ethnic group has shown signs of instability in some places. The highland ethnic groups in the Qishan District of Kaohsiung County, due to misunderstandings about the political orders of Kaohsiung, have moved their villages to Taitung and Taichung. Although no facts have been seen in other places, they are brewing dissatisfaction with the government's indifference. Therefore, in addition to the Civil Affairs Department trying to issue more than 21,000 pieces of woven fabrics and the relief branch issuing relief supplies, the authorities have decided to set up grocery stores in the mountainous areas and encourage administrative educators who go to the highlands by raising their salaries by 20% to 50%. Chief Chen said, "It is not feasible to run cooperatives in the highlands. It is still up to the Bureau of Trade to plan to open grocery stores and have highland compatriots be the managers. Don't make too much money, especially avoid exploitation." He quoted former Governor-General Ando Rikichi's words, "The highland ethnic groups are brave, active, and honorable in the South Pacific War. They are a good ethnic group, but unfortunately the Japanese did not know them," and said, "The Japanese regretted not knowing them, and now we cannot make the same mistake!"

### Finances in Difficulty

In the past, the expenditures of various counties and cities in Taiwan Province reached 1.3 billion yuan, while the income was only 200 million yuan. The Finance Department has balanced this large difference by allocating tax sources on the one hand, changing taxation from quantity to value, and reducing expenditures on the other hand. However, difficulties are still occurring in practice. The Japanese accounting year ends in March and begins in April. April, May, and June are the consolidation periods, and no taxes are collected. The previous income is adjusted, which is not enough to cover expenditures. The collection of land tax in kind will begin in August, and taxes account for 19% of the province's total income, about 300 million yuan. After consolidation, the income has increased two or three times, but it is still limited, and 80% depends on public enterprises. At present, this has become a problem. The railway loses 1 million yuan every day, and even after the increase in postal and telecommunications prices, the losses are still very large. Therefore, although it is currently a period of shortage, the future is not optimistic. Taiwan has not seen inflation because there are 600 million yuan of frozen Japanese funds and 1.34 billion yuan in the Bank of Taiwan that can be used. All counties and cities are short of money and cannot issue salaries. The Bank of Taiwan has no way to borrow money, so it can only order each unit to think of more ways on their own.

Chief Chen said, "Now it seems like a rebellious thing to raise the prices of public enterprises. This kind of thinking must be eradicated."

### Teacher Performance Evaluation Standards

Not long ago, the Department of Civil Affairs used cracking down on unlicensed rickshaws, children smoking, and riding public cars to school as one of the important performance assessments for police officers. Recently, there are new performance evaluation standards for education.

In Taiwan, a common phenomenon is occurring at all levels, that is, the discord between the Taiwanese and the mainlanders. Taiwanese and mainland primary school students often fight with each other, planting seeds of mutual resentment in their weak hearts.

Chief Chen said: Children fighting is precisely the experimental period for teachers' opportunity education, and they can take this opportunity to educate them. In the future, the performance of primary school principals or teachers can be based on the number of times primary school students fight, in order to determine their merits!"

This is a special situation in a special Taiwan.

### Banning Trivial Tabloids

There are a total of 48 registered newspapers and magazines in Taiwan. Except for the Taiwan Peace Daily splitting its edition and the aviation editions of the Ta Kung Pao and the Central Daily News not being registered, other publications are registered, about 20 or 30 kinds.

Chief Chen believes that the publication of trivial newspapers should be restricted. If small newspapers have no capital and no equipment, and just want to use the newspaper to extort money, they can be prohibited from publishing. The existing newspapers do not have to be ordered to stop publishing immediately, but the future ones can be restricted in terms of capital and talent. He said, "Whatever we do, we must have a policy, and laws and regulations should be used flexibly according to the policy, and should not be overly rigid." At the same time, he verbally issued an order:

"From now on, government agencies are not allowed to place advertisements in trivial tabloids!"

### The Outline of Hunan Politics

— Our newspaper's first day Changsha dispatch, special correspondent Gao Yuanli

The Hunan Provincial Government, in order to review provincial politics, has stipulated that this year's administrative meetings will be held in three districts: Changsha, Hengshan, and Yuanling. The Changsha District Administrative Meeting opened on July 22nd and closed on July 28th, lasting seven days. A total of 22 counties participated in the meeting. Although it is only one-third of Hunan Province, it is not difficult to see the outline of Hunan's current provincial politics in this meeting.

### Brigandage by Stragglers and Deserters

Since the major battles in Hunan, coupled with the severe disasters, the provincial government chairman has been replaced repeatedly in the past two years. It must be admitted that this has affected administrative efficiency, resulting in many important policies not being implemented. In particular, since Chairman Wang took office and announced the slogan "Disaster Relief First," commissioners and county magistrates have been focusing all their efforts on "disaster relief."

After more than half a year of "disaster" relief, the autumn harvest is showing great promise. From the perspective of the provincial government, the disaster situation is expected to be overcome, and the political focus should naturally shift. Therefore, Chairman Wang announced in the administrative meeting that the province's policy should be changed from "Disaster Relief First" to "Public Security First." This shift in political direction is aimed at the reality of the situation. Since the provincial chairman has put forward the slogan "Public Security First," there are certainly some problems with local public security. In the past year, the National Revolutionary Army stationed in Hunan has been transferred elsewhere, leaving the defenses empty. A group of stragglers and deserters left over from the war have taken the opportunity to rise up, and incidents of brigandage have occurred frequently. Moreover, the mountainous areas of western Hunan, which have always been infested with bandits, have become even more rampant. As a result of the activities of treacherous bandits, in Changsha County alone, 57 treacherous bandits have been arrested since the end of the war, and 4,100 have surrendered themselves. There are still many who have not surrendered. In other places, such as Pingjiang, Liuyang, Linxiang, and Xiangtan, there is a general atmosphere of social unrest and rampant banditry. If this situation is allowed to continue, Hunan will follow up a major disaster with major chaos, and will truly be headed for total collapse. Chairman Wang also pointed out at the meeting the method of dividing areas for responsible suppression: (1) If there are bandits within a county, the county magistrate is responsible for suppressing them; (2) If there are bandits at the junction of two counties, the commissioner is responsible for suppressing them; (3) If there are bandits at the border of two administrative regions, the police department is responsible for suppressing them. He also believes that the fundamental solution is still to "suppress bandits politically" and puts forward four basic requirements for the work of counties, townships, and towns in the future: (1) Stabilize local order, (2) Eliminate illegal levies, (3) Repair county and township roads, and (4) Reorganize warehouses and dams.

### Too Few Personnel, Insufficient Efficiency

This was the major topic of the Changsha administrative meeting. However, what was the reaction of the county magistrates after this issue was raised? In general, there were three requests: one, personnel; two, power; and three, money. Originally, the county government was small, but it had the greatest responsibility and the most work to do. However, the lack of personnel affected administrative efficiency. However, the "Measures for Adjusting the Political Structure of Counties and Townships in Hunan Province," passed by the fifth meeting of the Provincial Government this year, greatly reduced the number of personnel in each county. Therefore, the county magistrates raised objections at the meeting and requested an increase. However, Chairman Wang's reply was that the adjustment measures were based on actual needs and standards. He cited Sichuan as an example, where first-class counties had only 68 people, while first-class counties in Hunan had as many as 78. He believed that the number of people was sufficient, and the problem was whether they were capable enough. Therefore, the most important thing is to improve the quality of personnel, and the appointment of township and town heads should be raised to a higher level to promote local autonomy and improve administrative efficiency.

### Lively Discussion on the Issue of Power

The issue of "power" is indeed worthy of attention. Taking the issue of suppressing bandits raised by the provincial government as an example, the county magistrates deeply felt that they were in a dilemma. Prohibiting township and town offices from using armed guards was originally the right thing to do because those armed guards only oppress the people, and are the most hated and resented thing by the people. However, once there are bandits, without guns and soldiers, are the county magistrates and county government officials supposed to fight them with their bare hands? Although the county has a police bureau and the township has a police station, can the police station be commanded by the township office, because the police station is outside the township and town establishment?

The issue of the subordination of the county and municipal grain bureaus and tax collection offices is also worthy of attention. After the revision of the financial revenue and expenditure system, county-level finances have been better managed, but the tax collection agencies are not under the command and supervision of the county government, which naturally leads to restrictions. Moreover, in the past, county grain bureau chiefs often absconded after losing money, leaving the county magistrates with no one to complain to. Moreover, since the county is an autonomous unit, it is reasonable for taxes to be autonomous. After a lively discussion on this issue, it was decided to suggest that the central government merge the land tax and tax collection into a tax collection office, subordinate to the county government, and implemented from January of the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1947]. The personnel will be appointed by the Department of Finance. This will increase the tax revenue of both the province and the county, and the county's ability to operate may be strengthened as a result.

### Financial Shortages Make It Difficult to Cope

The issue of "money" is an issue that all county magistrates find difficult. As mentioned above, the county magistrate bears the greatest responsibility and should do the most. However, without money, nothing can be done. Although the financial difficulties at the county level have been resolved with the implementation of the revised financial revenue and expenditure system, the provincial level is still difficult. The temporary relief measures to fill the gap caused by the suspension of national tax allocations are the most important thing for the county level. From January to June of this year, Hunan received 1.65 billion yuan in national tax allocations, which was still felt to be lacking after being distributed to various counties. The Department of Finance drafted three temporary relief measures: (1) Counties that have already implemented grain storage and price stabilization can borrow the funds from grain storage and price stabilization; (2) Counties that have not implemented grain storage and price stabilization can borrow grain; (3) Counties that have neither grain to borrow nor grain storage funds to borrow can negotiate with the provincial bank to instruct its branches to provide short-term overdrafts. However, after eight years of war in Hunan, there are very few counties with grain storage, and it is doubtful whether the strength of the provincial bank is sufficient to cope with the situation.

### Political Integrity Depends on the County Level

The clarity and progress of politics are all entrusted to the county level, and the completion of local autonomy is the central focus of the central government's promotion for the past ten years. However, the inherent contradictions have been generally ignored. Liu Qianjun, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, pointed out the objective contradictions in implementing government orders and the contradictions within the government itself. He said that the people love to be scattered and free, while the government wants to organize and train them. The people want to be selfish and evade responsibility, while the government wants to conscript labor, conscript workers, and collect taxes. These are objective contradictions. The government wants to train the people to exercise their four powers, but is also worried that the people's abilities are not clear and interferes. In fact, it wants to mobilize the power of the people to complete construction, but is afraid of harming wealth and strength. It organizes the masses, but is afraid that the power of the mass organizations will oppose it. These are the contradictions within the government itself.

Since the existing contradictions are like this, and the "power," "money," and "personnel" of the county government have never been reasonably resolved, how can it do anything? This Changsha regional administrative meeting reached a preliminary solution to the above three matters, and perhaps Hunan politics can get on the right track in the future.

### The Sewage Problem in Shanghai

Continued from the eighth page.

The Malpractices of the Contracting System

For the administrative authorities, the contracting system has the advantage of saving trouble and ensuring a fixed amount of income on time. However, it also has many drawbacks. I believe that the lack of progress in this work is mostly due to the influence of this system.

The establishment and maintenance of this system is probably due to the fact that the responsible authorities dislike filth and fear trouble. This already fundamentally demonstrates an undesirable laziness. I often say that our work in sanitation is simply to turn filth into cleanliness and weakness into health. To deal with filth, we must face it squarely and never adopt an attitude of avoidance.

Moreover, feces are something that everyone dislikes. They would rather pay a few coins to get rid of it. On the other hand, some people regard it as a "treasure" and buy it according to its current value. Contractors exploit this contradiction to make huge profits. If the government authorities could not rely on middlemen, then this profit could be obtained by the government.

Speaking of which, I would like to present a fact: Many people regard contracting feces as a good business and try every means to obtain the position of contractor. Many people believe that being a feces contractor under the health bureau can immediately become a millionaire. Is this calculation accurate? According to the past situation, it can be said to be accurate. Initially, the concession authorities only wanted the feces to be removed, so the price was extremely low. Later, this attitude did not change, and the price of feces contracts was never carefully calculated. During the war, the currency fluctuated violently, and prices rose. The price of feces also rose, but the "cleanliness fee" paid by the contractors was fixed in the contract and did not increase with time. With these two reasons, wouldn't it be possible to make a fortune by contracting feces? Precisely because it was easy to make a fortune, some people used their power to achieve the purpose of contracting. In the past, everyone knew that the "Feces King" became a rich man by contracting feces, and everyone knew that the "Feces King" obtained the right to contract feces by relying on special powers.

I remember that last year, after the Health Bureau took over the various businesses of the puppet government, it was subjected to threats and inducements from various parties for the sake of contracting feces. This made the person in charge at the time pay more attention to this issue and conduct special research on it. The research confirmed that the most fair and reasonable way was to have the government manage it itself. Therefore, the case of taking it back for municipal management was passed at the municipal council meeting on March 8. But even at this time, some people opposed the suggestion of municipal management on the grounds that the government should not manage filthy matters. At that time, Director Yu forcefully corrected this concept, pointing out that the task of public health is to eliminate filth, and the more filthy the place, the more the efforts of the health authorities are needed. This is actually not only Director Yu's belief, but everyone who understands public health should think this way.

From an economic point of view, if the "Feces King" makes a fortune, it means that the government suffers a loss. In order to increase profits, contractors inevitably raise the price of feces for farmers or engage in hoarding. The management of feces carriers is poor, and there is a lot of leakage of feces, and it often happens that it is poured into sewers. This is a loss. Therefore, speaking of "economic utilization," the contracting system is also undesirable.

Government Management is Better Than Commercial Management

Abolishing the contracting system means that the government directly manages it. Government direct management can solve the above problems more easily than inviting merchants to contract. For example, regarding tools, contractors only seek temporary profits and do not plan for the long term, so they are naturally unwilling to spend more money. If the government manages it itself, a considerable amount can be allocated from the profits to organize and add to it at any time. Regarding the management of laborers, if the administrative power can be thoroughly implemented to the lower levels, and all isolation and concealment are eliminated, then all kinds of bad habits can be gradually broken, and a reasonable collection and transportation system can be gradually established. This kind of effort to remove the old and establish the new can never be expected from merchants who only seek profit. Only the government can establish a direction, plan comprehensively, weigh the advantages and disadvantages, and implement it step by step, and then it can be done. It was said above that feces carriers are linked together and are difficult to deal with. To be honest, we must take into account their living requirements for these laborers. However, many unreasonable aspects of their habits must be reformed one by one with reasonable means. For example, in the past, the Health Bureau paid great attention to the issue of limiting collection and transportation time and urged it in many ways. As a result, it was found that this issue was related to the number of tools, the allocation of land, and the number of feces carriers. There are too many unreasonable things in this, but in order to take care of the facts, we have to use reasonable methods to implement the solution. And to achieve the purpose of solving the problem, we believe that it is impossible to do it without government power and only by seeking it from contractors.

Furthermore, in terms of finance, the government's revenue from government management must be far better than from commercial management. Because in theory, government management can eliminate the enrichment of merchants and take the profits of merchants for public use. As a matter of fact, the Health Bureau took over the Yongda Company at the end of last year. From November, it changed the night soil business originally operated by Yongda to a joint government-business operation. Calculating its income: in October, Yongda paid a "cleanliness fee" of 508,950 yuan. In November, the first month of the joint government-business operation, the revenue increased to 9,734,330 yuan. From April of this year, the government implemented self-management, and the income increased even more. By early June, the daily income reached more than 11 million yuan. At that time, the Health Bureau planned to use the income from this cleaning business to add various urgent tools to gradually improve this business.

Some people say that government-run businesses are not run well. This is a dogmatic assertion, a prejudice. I don't need to argue much about this. Just look at the facts. And I believe that as long as we believe in the effectiveness of the government, believe that politics has hope of improvement, and is on the way to improvement, then this view cannot stand.

In addition, there is a serious issue that few people in public health pay attention to, which is the timing of the use of feces. In our country, both in the past and now, farmers are allowed to transport fresh feces to the countryside for direct use as fertilizer. I have never seen such fresh feces being used after a reasonable period of time. Therefore, diseases such as typhoid fever, cholera, dysentery, and parasites are constantly circulating and spreading. This is such a dangerous and serious issue. This problem is not easy to solve, but to solve it, only the method of government self-management can be taken.

Eliminate All Long-Standing Malpractices

From the above, we can see the seriousness of the nature of the feces problem and the complexity of the content of the Shanghai feces treatment problem. I advocate that the government should manage the feces business itself to replace the contracting system. Now that the government has managed it itself, I advocate continuing to manage it actively. Under the direct management of the government, many long-standing malpractices in the past can be gradually eliminated.

We do not hope that the municipal authorities will always be bothered by the collection and transportation of feces. We hope that the city will progress. The direction of this progress, in terms of feces treatment, is to gradually make everyone use flush toilets, that is, the buildings are equipped with flushing devices so that all feces can be directly transported underground to the final treatment place. In this way, not only is there no need to waste labor on collection and transportation, but in terms of hygiene, the danger of spreading bacteria can be avoided.

Now it is rumored that the municipal health authorities are going to transfer the work of feces treatment, which is absolutely related to public health, to agencies outside the health bureau. Colleagues in the health field are all worried about the health of the citizens of this city after hearing this. I hope that the people in charge of health in this city and the authorities responsible for municipal administration will discuss it more beforehand. You must know that the hygiene knowledge of us Chinese people is not as deeply understood as that of every foreigner, and all the hygiene facilities are not as complete as those of foreigners. If the cleaning work of this kind that absolutely belongs to the public health department is transferred to an organization outside the health agency, whether the health knowledge of the personnel at all levels who are engaged in this work is qualified, and whether everything can be properly arranged, in other words, whether the danger of improper handling can be avoided and the health of the citizens can be affected, this point should be given deep consideration!

### Replies to Readers: Medicine and Hygiene

(1) Chuan Ping asks: I am 27 years old, and I am still healthy. My hand bones were easily dislocated when I was young, but they could be realigned by shaking them. When I was a teenager, my left shoulder bone was occasionally dislocated when I used my hand to lift heavy objects. But it healed on its own. However, since last autumn, when I lift my left hand, I feel a "point" of pain in my shoulder joint, as if tendons and bones are rubbing against each other. If I lift it again, it does not hurt. Turning my arm is also the same. This summer, the soreness has slightly increased. If I lie on my back, bend my elbow, and shake my arm, my left shoulder bone makes a "crackling" sound and feels sore. The condition is even worse when the weather is cloudy and rainy. But I can still lift and hold heavy objects with my hand. It does not hurt when I am sleeping. I dare to ask: (1) What is the name of this disease? Will it get worse? Is it rheumatism? (2) How can it be treated? Are there any oral tablets or injections in Western medicine? Are there any in Chinese medicine? Is the anti-rheumatism wine on the market effective? (3) Can I seek treatment from a Chinese medicine traumatologist? Can this disease be cured completely? (4) Is the light, sticky nasal mucus in my left nostril sometimes related to this?

[Answer from Doctor of Medicine, Tang Ren]: 1, 2, 3, it is probably habitual dislocation. You need to see an orthopedic doctor for diagnosis and treatment. 4, it is not related. (2) Wei Ziwen, a refugee from Gaoyou, asks: Respectfully to the medical consultant of Shen Bao: Last summer, I recovered from malaria, and then I fled to Jiangnan. Because my body was weak after the illness and I could not rest, I soon suffered from inguinal hernia. My right testicle was swollen. At first, I did not feel pain. Later, when I walked further or faster, my testicle became pointed and hard, and there was a faint pain. I had to rest to recover, but it was still larger than my left testicle. Recently, even when using a cloth bag, it still feels dull pain when sitting or lying down. I have used warm medicines such as white chuanhui incense to apply it, but it has been ineffective. I have always admired your newspaper for benefiting the people. I respectfully write to ask for the method of treatment. I am very grateful.

[Answer from Doctor of Medicine, Tang Ren]: You need to undergo inguinal hernia radical surgery. (3) Qi Ziji asks: (1) Several years ago, a bean-sized lump suddenly appeared in my neck. It cannot be moved by pushing it. I was afraid that it would become scrofula, so I went to the hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. But to this day, if my head is exercised violently, I feel pain from time to time. I don't know what disease it is? (2) How can I treat my nervous breakdown, which leads to weak memory, and I often feel headaches and get angry easily? (3) What are the symptoms of early lung disease? (4) What is the reason for being flustered when doing things?

[Answer from Doctor of Medicine, Tang Ren]: (1) It may be swollen lymph nodes. (2) Take more phosphorus, calcium, and vitamin B preparations. (3) The general symptoms of early pulmonary tuberculosis are cough, night sweats. (4) Neurasthenia.

### How to Prevent and Treat Athlete's Foot?

— Zhang Ming

New Theories on the Prevention and Treatment of Athlete's Foot

The pathogen of athlete's foot is the tinea fungus. Therefore, whether for prevention or treatment, one must focus on eradicating the tinea fungus.

Tinea fungus is a very common microorganism. Even feet and socks that do not have athlete's foot often contain it. Patients with athlete's foot naturally have a particularly large number of tinea fungi when the disease is active, and even when the disease is not active, the fungus still exists. The breeding of this fungus requires high temperatures and humidity. Therefore, once summer arrives, the temperature and humidity meet the conditions for tinea fungus breeding, and the fungi lurking on the feet and in the socks become very active, easily invading the skin of the feet and causing illness. Hong Kong is hot and humid, so athlete's foot is particularly prevalent there. The disease name "Hong Kong foot" comes from this.

To prevent and treat athlete's foot, it is necessary to eradicate the tinea fungus, because it not only lives on the surface of the skin of the foot, but also invades the inside of the skin when the disease occurs. In addition to the skin, there are naturally many tinea fungi inside the shoes and socks. Therefore, we have two targets: the feet and the shoes and socks.

Shoe and Sock Disinfection

Patients with athlete's foot often have recurrences every summer. If you want to prevent recurrence, you must thoroughly disinfect your used shoes and socks to eradicate the residual fungus.

Cloth shoes and machine-made shoes can be washed and then boiled in water for disinfection. Disinfecting leather shoes is more troublesome and can be done as follows:

1.  Thoroughly wash the inside of the shoe with water and soap;
2.  Thoroughly dry it with a dry cloth;
3.  Spread a thin layer of absorbent cotton evenly inside the shoe;
4.  Purchase a small amount of formaldehyde solution (Formalin) from the pharmacy, dilute it ten times with water. When using, take the diluted liquid and pour it onto the cotton in the shoe, about one teaspoon per shoe (about four cc);
5.  Place the medicated shoes in a paper box, close the lid tightly, and then wrap the outside with paper to reduce air leakage; disinfect in this way for six hours;
6.  Remove the shoes and discard the thin layer of cotton inside. Place the shoes in a ventilated place to air out for twenty-four hours;
7.  Apply shoe polish and then use.

Foot Hygiene

Shoe and sock disinfection must be coordinated with foot disinfection, otherwise, wearing disinfected shoes and socks on undisinfected feet, or putting fungus-free feet into undisinfected shoes and socks, will be the same as not disinfecting at all.

After the athlete's foot symptoms have been cured, thoroughly wash the feet with soap and hot water, dry them, and then lightly rub the entire foot with boric acid talcum powder (a mixture of 10 parts boric acid powder and 90 parts talcum powder), especially between the toes and on the soles of the feet. After rubbing, put on disinfected shoes and socks.

Every time summer is approaching, wash your feet every night, and after washing, use powder as described above. Apply powder again before putting on shoes in the morning.

Recently, some people have advocated replacing boric acid powder with sodium propionate. Sodium propionate (Sodium Propionate) one part, mixed with ninety-nine parts of talcum powder. Sodium propionate is a recently discovered drug for killing tinea fungus, and its efficacy is very strong. It is also used for the treatment of athlete's foot.

Bleach solution was once widely used as a foot bath ten years ago, and it has the effect of killing tinea fungus. Public swimming pools and school bathrooms mostly use this type of foot bath equipment. Anyone entering the pool or bath must soak their feet in this water for a short time to prevent the spread of tinea fungus and the prevalence of athlete's foot. It is now known that the efficacy of this type of foot bath is not reliable and has no practical value.

Treatment Medications

There are many drugs for treating athlete's foot, but so far, there is no specific drug. Also, because the symptoms of each stage of athlete's foot are very different, drugs that are effective for stage A are not effective for other stages, and sometimes even harmful. None of the various athlete's foot lotions or moisture creams sold on the market can be reliably used by patients to treat athlete's foot themselves.

These types of lotions and creams mostly contain salicylic acid and benzoic acid, which are irritating. They have considerable curative effect for chronic conditions, but often have no curative effect for acute conditions, and are instead prone to causing inflammation. In addition, iodine, red medicine, or gentian violet (the main component is gentian violet) also have the effect of killing tinea fungus, but they are also irritating and equally inappropriate. A mixture of phenol and camphor that was popular in the United States seven or eight years ago was also attacked by experts for easily causing irritating inflammation, and soon disappeared from the market. Recently popular sulfonamide drugs, such as Sulfamidazole, are often made into ointments to treat athlete's foot, and there is even a risk of causing allergic reactions. Once this allergic reaction occurs, if it is necessary to use this type of drug again in the future, whether internally or externally, it can cause a reaction, and the severe cases can be fatal. This point will be discussed in another article in the future.

Recently, various fatty acid preparations such as propionic acid (Propionil acid), caprylic acid (Caprylic acid) and undecylenic acid (Undecylenic acid) have been found to have a strong ability to kill tinea fungus and are not irritating. They are gradually becoming widely used in the United States. Another new treatment method is to spray the affected area with ethyl chloride (Ethyl Chlorice) until the local skin is cold and turns white. Its effect is also good. Cadmium chloride solution (Cadmium chloride) has also been tried and is said to have good results.

It is best for patients to use the aforementioned boric acid talcum powder for self-treatment. It is very effective and also safe for common mild cases, and there is no risk of causing inflammation. See foot hygiene section for usage. Once local inflammation and suppuration occur, you should seek medical treatment and not be negligent.

·Key points to note·

1.  Wash your feet frequently, at least once a day, and change socks after washing. Those who sweat a lot on their feet should wash and change more often.
2.  Choose shoes that are breathable and absorbent. Avoid using rubber-soled shoes in summer.
3.  Prepare several pairs of shoes in summer and change them once in the morning and afternoon each day. Place the removed shoes in a ventilated place.
4.  Avoid bad habits such as picking at your toes and pinching your feet to avoid local damage and spreading the virus to other places.
5.  Avoid sharing shoes with others and do not use slippers in public places.
6.  Those who go to public swimming pools or bathrooms should pay attention to rinsing their feet after each visit and sprinkle them with boric acid talcum powder.

### A Brief Discussion on Athlete's Foot

Athlete's foot is a very common disease, commonly known as "Hong Kong foot," which often starts between the toes. Most people think it is "dampness" and do not pay enough attention to it. Moreover, they mistakenly believe that the presence of "dampness" is sufficient to reduce other physical ailments. This view is completely wrong. The reason for the error is a lack of understanding of the condition. The error is passed on again and again, causing the condition to be underestimated, often leading to serious consequences. In severe cases, one cannot walk and must stay in bed for treatment, which is no different from other serious illnesses. Patients only seek medical treatment at this time, which is already a considerable loss.

Athlete's foot is a skin infectious disease. It comes from contact with tinea fungi in the air or the belongings of other patients with tinea fungal infections. The location is not limited to the feet, and there is more than one type of tinea fungus. It is more common on the feet because of its suitable conditions. Athlete's foot is called "Hong Kong foot," which shows that it occurs more often in warm and moist places; and the feet are often surrounded by shoes and socks, and in hot weather, foot sweat increases, and heat is not easily dissipated. Both of these conditions are suitable for the growth and invasion of tinea fungi, causing athlete's foot. Sometimes, the fingernails and trunk are also infected at the same time, resulting in a larger range. Tinea fungi are distributed everywhere, and there are also some in the air. The infection is like bacteria. Most people are already somewhat afraid of bacteria and take precautions, but for tinea fungi, they do not pay attention because they do not know its severity. Tinea fungi multiply extremely quickly, and must be at a very high temperature to be killed. Ordinary disinfectants and low temperatures have no effect at all. Therefore, the belongings of all tinea fungal patients must be separated, especially those that have direct contact with the tinea fungal site.

Athlete's foot can be divided into acute and chronic types. Acute athlete's foot is often mistaken for "dampness" because a lot of water is indeed discharged, especially after rubbing to stop the itching. There are many small blisters on the edges of the toes and on both sides of the feet, and the itching is particularly severe, and the skin is red. Chronic athlete's foot is the most common, and is not taken seriously: the area between the toes is slightly moist, the epidermis is white, or there is peeling; the skin on the soles of the feet and the back of the feet becomes dry and thick, and there are occasional cracks. This condition is extremely common. Without a doctor, patients can diagnose it themselves.

Simple athlete's foot is often neglected, and sometimes has adverse consequences. Here are a few common ones: (1) The toenails are extremely prone to turning gray-white and thick. If it spreads to the hands, the fingernails will also undergo the same changes. From an aesthetic point of view, this is very bad. (2) After the skin is damaged by tinea fungi, its resistance is reduced; at the same time, the skin has small cracks after scratching, which can easily be invaded by pus-forming bacteria on the surface of the skin, resulting in infections such as lymphangitis or erysipelas. The condition is that the inguinal lymph nodes are swollen and painful, red lines appear on the inside of the thigh, or there is migratory redness, swelling and pain on the back of the foot or ankle, and the whole body is feverish and chills. At this time, patients have difficulty walking and must lie down. This condition is not uncommon. (3) If there are frequent erysipelas or erysipelas-like infections. The legs and feet can become elephantiasis, commonly known as "big legs". Regardless of other pathologies, both the patient and the onlookers have a bad feeling. (4) If a certain bacterium invades the blood in excessive amounts from the fungal area, it can cause bacteremia, which is a serious condition and can even be fatal. The above are just a few examples. Just in terms of athlete's foot itself, the acute type hinders movement, delays work, and in public institutions, workers cannot go to work and students cannot attend classes.

Therefore, although athlete's foot is a minor ailment, it has its universality and seriousness, and should not be ignored. The prevention method is to isolate the tinea fungus as much as possible; those who have been infected should prevent its development. It is best not to go to public places such as unclean bathrooms and swimming pools. Even in clean bathrooms or swimming pools, you should use your own towels, and rinse and dry with clean water after bathing or swimming. You must always change your shoes and socks, keep your feet clean, keep them dry, and avoid bad habits such as rubbing and pinching your feet.

### Oral Healthcare

— Shi Xi

Teeth are one of the main organs for eating, and their completeness is closely related to human health. We must not neglect our teeth because they are a small matter, so as not to affect the overall health of our body and mind.

Calcium is the main component of teeth. When infants are in the womb, they absorb a large amount of calcium from the mother's body for the growth of bones. Therefore, Westerners have the saying "The more children you have, the more teeth you lose." Pregnant women should eat more foods containing calcium to avoid damage to their teeth.

When teeth chew food, food residue often remains on the enamel. If it is not washed away, it is easy to produce acidification, which damages the entire tooth. Therefore, if we want to protect our teeth, we must rinse our mouths and brush our teeth after eating. In addition, we must also pay attention to the nutrition of the teeth:

Calcium and vitamins A, C, and D are the main nutrients for healthy and beautiful teeth.

Calcium and vitamin A are found in large quantities in milk and green leafy vegetables, but without vitamin D (sunlight and cod liver oil) applied at the same time, it is difficult to produce the ideal nutritional effect. Therefore, sunbathing has a great effect on the health of teeth.

Drinking a glass of fruit juice rich in vitamin C every day - oranges, lemons, grapes, or tomatoes - is also a way to maintain healthy teeth.

As for eating too much candy, it damages the enamel, damages the roots of the teeth, and creates cavities, so you must pay attention to it at all times. Diseased teeth are also prone to causing indigestion, leading to stomach problems.

### Anemia and Blood Tonics (Part 2) (5) The Basic Raw Materials for Red Blood Cell Production

— Zhang Changshao

Red blood cells are composed of two parts: hemoglobin and stroma. Both of these components can be manufactured by the body itself, and new blood cells are constantly produced to replenish normal losses and non-excessive abnormal losses. The manufacture of each component requires a basic raw material. A lack of any of these raw materials can affect the new production function of red blood cells and lead to anemia.

According to recent reports, the basic raw material for manufacturing stroma is probably the main component in liver preparations, which is the so-called hematinic principle component. A lack of blood tonics will produce a type of fatal pernicious anemia. The characteristic of this anemia is that the red blood cells are particularly large and contain a high amount of hemoglobin, so it is also called macrocytic anemia. Liver preparations have a specific effect on this anemia, while iron preparations are useless. Before the invention of liver preparations, pernicious anemia was an incurable disease, and the patient became increasingly serious until death. The invention of liver preparations saved many lives.

Iron is the basic raw material for manufacturing hemoglobin. Hemoglobin itself is a compound of iron and protein. Naturally, protein is also an important raw material, but because it is very rich in food and easy to obtain, it is not in short supply except for those who are starving, so it is not actually important. Iron is different. Food contains very little iron, which can barely meet normal needs. Once the need increases sharply, it feels insufficient, leading to anemia. The characteristic of this anemia is that the red blood cells are particularly small in size and contain a lower amount of hemoglobin than normal, so it is also called microcytic anemia.

Pernicious anemia is an uncommon disease even in Europe and the United States, and it is even rarer in China, as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Ordinary general practitioners rarely see it in their lifetime. Almost all of the common anemia cases are microcytic, and its specific drug is iron. Although liver preparations are extremely expensive, they can be said to be useless. Therefore, for ordinary anemia, whether for prevention or treatment, iron is the most important drug, and it can also be said to be the only specific drug.

(6) Since pernicious anemia is so rare in China, we can disregard liver preparations when discussing blood tonics. Therefore, the terms iron preparation and blood tonic actually become synonymous. All blood tonics will lose their blood-tonifying effect if they lack iron.

In recent years, various isotopes have been produced by atomic energy research and are widely used in medicine as research tools. Since 1938, iron isotopes, namely radio-iron, have been used in various experiments, clarifying many aspects of the pharmacology of iron preparations.

The amount of tin contained in our whole body is only about four centimeters, which is about the equivalent of a two-inch nail. Almost all of the iron in the body is used to manufacture hemoglobin. Adult men need about five to eight milligrams of iron per day to replenish normal losses. Women, due to the loss of blood during menstruation, need about two to four times that amount. Children need even more iron due to development, about 0.6 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. The daily iron requirement during pregnancy is about twenty milligrams.

Foods with higher iron content are red meats, egg yolks, and green vegetables, especially spinach. Human milk and cow's milk contain very little iron, so breastfed babies are prone to anemia and must be supplemented with vegetable juice or fruit juice. Whole wheat flour and brown rice contain more iron than refined flour and white rice. The iron content of chicken, duck, pig, and cow blood is the highest among all foods. The iron content in ordinary Chinese diets is quite high, enough to meet ordinary physiological needs. Those who cook with iron pots have additional iron mixed into their food. However, for anemic patients, the iron content in food is far from enough to meet the needs of treatment, and iron preparations must be used to remedy this.

In the past, there were various misconceptions about the value of iron preparations, which must be corrected. The pharmacology of iron preparations has been discussed in detail in my book Modern Therapeutics, pages 187-191. Here are a few points:

(1) All kinds of iron preparations, from the iron in iron pots and nails to complex organic iron preparations, have completely the same effect and can all be used as blood tonics.

(2) Organic iron is not as easily absorbed as inorganic iron, so although its price is far more expensive than simple inorganic iron, its therapeutic value is far inferior to the latter.

(3) Among inorganic iron preparations, ferrous salts are better than ferric salts because they are more easily absorbed.

(4) The most effective drug is the cheapest ferrous sulfate. The price before the war was only one or two cents per day, and now it is only about ten dollars. The total amount needed to cure anemia is only a few hundred dollars (price a month ago). Liver preparations, which cost thousands of dollars per injection, may scare poor patients with their high price, but other than psychological effects, they have no effect.

(5) The doses of iron preparations commonly used are often too small. Although there are many brands of ordinary blood tonic pills, they are actually nothing more than ferrous carbonate pills. Each pill contains very little iron, and the effective dose is ten to twenty pills each time, thirty to sixty pills per day. Taking this pill is almost like eating peanuts in order to exert its maximum therapeutic effect. However, the ordinary instructions indicate one or two pills each time, which is really too small a dose and takes too long to work. However, readers must not be clever and arbitrarily buy a bottle of blood tonic pills and eat them like peanuts, because ordinary iron preparations themselves are harmless if you eat a little more, but the blood tonic pills sold on the market may also contain other ingredients, and eating too much can easily cause poisoning, so do not be careless. In short, if a patient has significant anemia, they should ask a reliable doctor to prescribe medicine.

(7) Waste! Waste! Waste!

Although there are no slippery doctors among my clinical friends, there are also a few who like to give anemic patients injections of liver preparations. This phenomenon is not uncommon among foreign friends either. Naturally, injection treatment can charge patients more fees, but it increases the patient's economic burden a lot, and this increase is completely meaningless. This is waste! Waste! Waste!

Liver preparations are a specific drug for pernicious anemia and have saved many lives, which is a fact. However, pernicious anemia is extremely rare in China, and many general practitioners have never seen it in their lifetime, which is also a fact. For ordinary anemia, only iron preparations have a specific effect. Liver preparations, whether taken orally or injected, have no specific effect. This point has long been fully proven by world authorities and is beyond doubt. Naturally, the liver contains a considerable amount of iron, and also has vitamins and proteins, so it is okay to eat it as food. However, it is really too unfair and too absurd to spend thousands of dollars for a shot for a tiny amount of iron. Moreover, most of them are imported, and this economic loss is really spent unnecessarily.

China, with the exception of a few cases each year, can be said to be a country without pernicious anemia, and there should be no market for liver preparations. The appearance of various brands of liver preparations on the market, whether they are domestic or foreign products, is like giving scientific medicine a heavy slap in the face. Friends, let us wash away this shame! (Continued on the 2nd of this month)

### Mei Baiqi's Autobiography

— Translated by Jian Yi

The musician Mei Baiqi (Paci) once served as the conductor of the former Municipal Council Orchestra and was revered as a grand master of music in the Far East. Scholars looked up to him as they would Mount Tai and the Big Dipper. Sadly, he passed away on the 3rd of this month due to illness. People in the art world deeply mourn his passing. Here, we publish a translation of his autobiography written during his lifetime, as a tribute of mourning. — Editor

I was born in Florence in 1878. At the age of seven, I began studying piano at a famous Neapolitan school. At eleven, I gave my first public performance at the now-defunct "Del Foudo" theater in Naples. However, despite such early success, my father would not allow me to dedicate myself entirely to the study of music, insisting that I remain at an academy in Naples as a "student on scholarship." At the age of fourteen, one day, I sold all my books and my only valuable possession—an old pocket watch—and, with a few lire, fled from the academy in Naples to Rome. This was because I knew that the pianist Sgambati (Liszt's last student), whom I admired, was there, and I hoped to see him or become one of his students. But approaching or meeting Sgambati was much more difficult than I had imagined! Two days after arriving in Rome, I took all my sheet music to his stately residence on Via della Croce and tried to explain my situation to a very stern "attendant." However, I was politely refused. Finally, the "attendant" said, "The professor does not receive anyone without a letter of introduction."

At that time, I was a lonely child in the city of Rome. When I had only two lire left, my courage completely disappeared, and I sent a telegram to my father admitting my escape, asking for his forgiveness and help. Two days later, my mother found me waiting for her at the station, full of hope. A decorated room for the two of us was found—an old, small grand piano, and a letter of introduction to Sgambati were all prepared. Thus, the happy life of a "Sgambati student," practicing six or seven hours a day, began from that point onward.

Soon, Sgambati realized that my family's expenses were considerable due to my father's position in Milan and my mother and I living in Rome. After a few months, he was satisfied with my work and interested in my future piano career, so he refused to accept any fees for my lessons. Three years passed like a day, and I no longer needed to go to his exquisite music room to enjoy his deeply moving instruction.

In 1895, at the age of seventeen, I participated in the international competition for the Liszt Prize held in Rome. As a result, I was the winner among sixty-three young people of different nationalities and schools.

From then on, I began my career as a pianist. For an entire season, I gave concerts in Italy, France, Austria, and other places. Only there did I first hear the symphony concerts and great conductors that amazed me. I immediately saw the piano as a pitiful asset in musical expression. The next year, I went to Milan, hoping to become a student of composition and orchestration at the local famous conservatory.

That year, there were only four openings for the "composition course," and it was said that the exam was very difficult and strict. At that time, I was certainly a good pianist, and three years of great teaching and friendship from Sgambati were enough to make me a good musician. However, I lacked the preparation of a music theory scholar—I was very afraid to take the risk.

Luck helped me. At a Milanese social gathering where the Viscount of Modrone, the Mecenate of the Theatre "La Scala," often gathered local celebrities for musical performances, I was asked to perform. After I played Beethoven's "Appassionata Sonata," guess who came to compliment me—Puccini! (A famous modern Italian opera composer). Trembling and happy, I told him my hope of entering the composition class at the conservatory, and the preparation work that worried me the most. "Don't be afraid," he said, "I know all the examiners, and I can give you a card with a few good words." Now, I was a hundred times more courageous. On the designated day, I took my application to the "Examining Committee," and at the same time handed a tightly sealed letter of introduction from Puccini to the chairman. As for what was said in this letter, I had no idea. The chairman looked at the letter, smiled, and passed it to the other examiners, then said to me, "I think we can accept Puccini's advice, but would you be willing to play the 'Appassionata Sonata' for us?" You can imagine how surprised I was by this! I stood there speechless, hoping for some explanation. Then, the chairman called me again and said, "Perhaps you don't know what Puccini wrote for you? Please read this card."

Puccini wrote:

"The young Paci is participating in this exam without prior preparation. But don't waste time testing him on 'forbidden fifths'; instead, have him play Beethoven's Appassionata Sonata." I know you wouldn't want to lose a student with a promising future."

I was relieved. Now, thinking back to the many years since I devoted myself to the life of a pianist, I have never again performed the "Appassionata Sonata" in front of some great music critics (I mean as well as that).

Since studying at the Conservatory for four years, I should thank Puccini's patronage again. I served as assistant conductor in three major theaters in Milan—"Lirico," "Dal Verne," and "La Scala." Therefore, I was able to receive guidance on conducting from many great conductors: Ferrari, Mugone, Mascherovie, and the greatest of them all, Toscanini.

In any case, studying and settling in Milan for four years felt too long to my active nature and temperament. Moreover, in those years, my musical life was focused only on opera, and concerts and symphonies were few and far between, which caused a "pure music" hunger in my nature—as the French say, "One always remembers one's first love easily."

The long separation from the piano had now become such a strong love. One day in 1902, I suddenly decided to restart my travels and wander the world as a pianist. The travels were unlimited until December 1918, when Stock, the famous Far East concert manager, invited me to make an extensive trip to China and Japan. Thus, I arrived in Shanghai.

I arrived in Shanghai on December 28th, but unfortunately contracted a serious illness. When I was carried off the ship to the hospital, my planned trip was canceled. In February 1919, when I was able to play again, I gave my first solo concert at the Lyceum Theatre, and achieved a great success.

But my wandering life came to an end here. During the wandering time forced to stay in Shanghai, I had the idea of ​​organizing an orchestra with talented pianists employed in all hotels and dance halls to accompany my piano concertos. In April, under my own baton, I played Mozart's "Coronation Concerto."

The day after the concert, the newspapers naturally launched a movement to reorganize the Municipal Council Orchestra in a new way. This era seemed to be very prosperous, and Shanghai was happy and full of life. Perhaps I was a little tired of the sixteen years of wandering life as a pianist and dreamed of a future with an orchestra, so I accepted the appointment of the Municipal Council authorities and organized this orchestra.

Anyone who knows the situation in Shanghai in 1919 can easily imagine the reaction of Shanghai citizens after the four years of the war when they heard an orchestra like this and the former Municipal Council Brass Band, which contained only fourteen mostly Filipino musicians. (Translated from the souvenir program of the farewell concert of the Municipal Council Orchestra, 1942)

### In the Church

— Shi Bei

In recent years, domestic universities, no matter which one, have organizations called "Fellowships." Our place is no exception. Next to the school, there is a small church, beautifully unique like a child. Every Sunday evening, leisurely, gentle, and forgiving singing comes from the small church. Often unintentionally, I am led there by this singing. There, I met a girl. She is a devout Christian. One Sunday night, after everyone who attended the service in the church had dispersed, only she remained. She asked me to stay and talk with her. Before long, she seemed intentionally to steer the conversation to "Religion and Writers."

She spoke gently, like a pastor leading a prayer in a lifelike manner:

"Religion and literature share a common theme and a common purpose. They both explore truth, goodness, and beauty. Their theme is created by the inner meaning and expression of this truth, goodness, and beauty. Their purpose is to use concrete forms and tolerant methods to help humanity reach the highest realm. Therefore, a pastor is also a literary writer. A pastor should possess the inner qualities and cultivation that can be said to have reached the requirements of a writer. He only needs to polish his writing skills more. But a writer needs more religious cultivation and must pay attention at all times. Only in this way can he place his pen on the love of humanity and the lives of the masses."

She paused for a moment, looked at me, and smiled as if waiting for my opinion.

"I agree with your statement, but religion has a god as its master. The pastor's duty is only to convey Jesus's will. But a writer has no one to be his master. If there is one, then it is only the vast people and the real world. One serves God, and the other serves the people. Isn't this a big difference?" I said slowly.

The electric lights illuminated us. The church was quiet. The empty rows of chairs solemnly extended their backrests. In the light, these coffee-colored chairs emitted purple-green light, as if they were attentively listening to the preaching of religion.

"I think this question should be explained like this; that is, to point out what standards Jesus needs and what standards the people need? Undoubtedly, both require gentleness, obedience, meekness, and great love. They are from the same source, so Jesus and the people are not separate entities; there is no mysterious difference between pastors and writers."

Because she knew that I was not a believer, she continued to explain in detail.

"Jesus uses that gentleness, meekness, and love to grasp the ideals of mankind, making him an object of human devotion. There is no doubt about this. But some people love Jesus not because he specifically possesses these spirits, but primarily because they worship him as an idol. This is an unconscious and huge mistake; it also often becomes the starting point for others to attack religion. But in such a situation, the attackers are naturally not shooting arrows without a target, but they should criticize those who have not recognized the meaning of faith, not religion itself."

She seemed to realize that she was overly excited and softened her voice a little.

"Jesus was the first person to discover the soul and confirm its existence, because he grasped a transcendent and elusive emotion. Mr. Lu Xun was one of the people who discovered the soul of the Chinese nation. Ah Q precisely revealed the decadent side of the national soul. If a writer does not have the wisdom and courage to portray the soul, he cannot go deep."

Because I did not object to her opinion, I remained silent as usual.

She asked the church manager to bring us two cups of tea. She took the tea and slowly placed a cup on the horizontal shelf behind the chair in front of me. She held a cup herself and moved it to her lips, sipping it lightly. I picked up the cup of tea she gave me and felt it was warm and fragrant, like a stream of gentle emotion flowing into my heart.

I opened the lid of the teacup, and the hot steam clouded my glasses; after a while, the steam disappeared, and I saw her delicate mouth, continuing the conversation just now.

"A female pastor once told me: Forgiveness is nobler than punishment, and love can soothe people's hearts better than autocracy; to grasp the hearts of mankind as lovely as the fragrance of flowers or the purity of children, this is the gentle and obedient religious thought and behavior. We not only require a writer to do this, but also require him to use his pen to tell people to go this way. ……

"Tolstoy was once a person who most opposed religion, but when he reached his later years, he returned to the path of religion. Indeed, we still have unsound understanding of the attitude towards religion. I often remember Tolstoy's words. It is best to repeat his words now and take the same attitude as him."

He took a sip of tea, and I played with the lid of the teacup, listening to her.

"Tolstoy said that true religion is a relationship between man and the surrounding infinite life that is rational and intelligent, which connects his life with the infinite and guides his behavior. Do you believe his words?"

I nodded, expressing a satisfied smile, and she smiled happily too.

The night was getting deeper, and we stood up at the same time. I looked up at the large crucifix hanging on the wall behind the indoor pulpit, and the surroundings seemed to show a halo of light.

I turned my face and looked at her again. On her face, there was still the usual slight smile. I said goodbye to her and left the church first.

Along the fence, I slowly strolled back to the dormitory. The snow-white marigolds by the roadside looked even whiter in the night. A burst of fragrant spring night breeze greeted me. I looked back at this small church. The girl's words were still in my ears. Although she did not intend to preach to me or ask me to become a believer, I had no intention of doing so either; but I hoped and believed that people should go towards the path of ultimate goodness. - This idea can fill my emptiness, or it can comfort this girl's love for me.

### Shipbuilding (Selected World Famous Paintings)

— By John Constable (1776—1837)

Displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London

Constable enjoyed fame in France during his lifetime, but it was not until after his death that people in his native England fully appreciated his genius. His father was a wealthy owner of a flour mill. Old Constable originally intended to have him inherit his father's business, so he joined the flour mill at the age of eighteen. However, his talent had to find an outlet, and as a result, his parents finally sent him to London to study art. Two years later, he returned to his hometown and replaced an old employee in the flour mill; after doing it for about a year, he entered the Royal Academy.

Initially, he also studied in the traditional way: painting portraits and copying famous works. The first landscape painting he exhibited at the academy received great encouragement and praise from the school's principal. He has always been convinced that he can take the path of a natural painter - emerald green grass, gurgling streams.

"Shipbuilding" was painted by Constable in 1815 and is an important step in his process of creating great works and gaining fame.

Constable was a great painter who loved nature and the countryside.

### People's Words Are Lovely

— Shao Fu

Regarding the election of Miss Shanghai, the Jiangsu and Anhui Refugee Relief Association specially entertained the press and candidates yesterday. It is said that Miss Yuan Xuefen of the Yue Opera Group stated on the spot that she did not intend to participate, because of "people's words are frightening". I guess the atmosphere in the field at that time must have been quite tense. This can be understood from Mr. Wu Kaixian's subsequent speech. Mr. Wu said that "people's words are frightening" should be changed to "people's words are lovely".

We have no way of knowing what Miss Yuan's words refer to, but thinking carefully, it must be serious. I remember that the movie star Ruan Lingyu once said "people's words are frightening" before she died. Honestly, a journalist with justice, personality, and awe of the sacredness and importance of his responsibility swears that he must be careful and responsible for his words. As for catching wind and shadows and creating rumors, that cannot be regarded as a vow. Therefore, reports or comments based on objective facts have their power. It is not impossible to say that it is frightening.

In today's society, it is difficult to avoid gossip on any matter. People's minds have fallen into a stage of unbelief, and they like to think about everything from the bad side, like to read negative articles, like to listen to ghost stories, and like to know secrets or privacy. If there is no courage to face this great countercurrent, what way is there to go other than drifting with the tide? Taking the Miss Shanghai election as an example, who is brave, who is cowardly, and who is saying sarcasm from the sidelines is clear. Here, it makes people feel that Miss Yuan Xuefen is still innocent after all. Where are many people who claim to be pioneers in the women's world and claim to be enthusiastic about social welfare? Why don't they come out?

Zilu was happy when he heard criticism. Mr. Wu Kaixian's "people's words are lovely" has a philosophical meaning. The popular saying should be to accept criticism and implement self-examination. If a person can truly feel that people's words are lovely, this person is at least humble, cultivated, and able to respect the opinions of others. Naturally, "lovely" is one thing. It only expresses a person's attitude towards the other person or a state of psychological reflection. As for whether to accept and adopt it, that is another matter, because this involves the judgment and evaluation of people's words.

In the principle of being a person, we should practice "people's words are lovely." Regardless of the other party's motivation or purpose, and regardless of whether it is slander or praise, he is always concerned about himself. Shouldn't we treat people who care about us with good manners?

### The Shady Dealings of Employment Agencies: Hard to Find Good Servants, Even with Money

— Yi

Having read your publication's article "Servants Are Difficult to Serve," I deeply sympathize. However, in my opinion, the servants themselves are not as difficult to deal with as the employment agency managers who arrange their hiring. Without immense patience, one can forget about ever finding a good servant. The following is an account of my family's experience in hiring servants.

Last month, my family sought to hire a servant through a certain employment agency on a certain street. The agency manager brought a servant, a woman from Pudong, around thirty years old. My wife questioned her briefly and, finding her character acceptable, decided to try her out. The agency manager demanded 5,000 yuan for transportation fees and, before leaving, specified a three-day trial period. If both parties were satisfied, they would discuss wages. Nothing happened that night. The next day, after lunch, the servant suddenly said to my wife, "I want to leave. I can't get used to working here." My wife asked her what she couldn't get used to, but she only smiled and didn't answer, with the attitude of "stay if we agree, leave if we don't." My wife reluctantly gave her 2,000 yuan in wages and let her go. Because my family urgently needed a servant, I returned to the employment agency and explained the situation. Within two hours, the agency manager brought another servant, also around forty, with a strong local accent mixed with some Jiangbei tones. We agreed to try her out and paid the agency manager 5,000 yuan for transportation. That evening, this servant kept asking my wife endless, bothersome questions: How many "dou" of white rice were used per meal? Who measured the rice when it was washed? Was rice surreptitiously added? How much money was spent on groceries each day? Did relatives visit often? Was the door locked when Madam went to the movies? All sorts of irrelevant and nonsensical questions that made my wife's heart race. The next day, after lunch, the servant announced, "Madam, I want to leave. I can't get used to working here." My wife quickly agreed, "Even if you could get used to it, I wouldn't want you. Here's 2,000 yuan, leave quickly." I switched to another employment agency to hire, and for three consecutive days, I changed three servants, always paying "2,000 yuan in wages for one night and three meals, plus 5,000 yuan for transportation." It seemed they were all graduates of the same training school. Later, one servant actually stayed for a day without saying she would leave. Three days later, the agency manager came to inquire if this woman was satisfactory. My wife patiently discussed wages with him. The result was a monthly wage of 60,000 yuan in legal tender. The agency's fee was to be paid half by the employer and half by the servant. My wife paid him 30,000 yuan upfront. Since the servant had no money, she borrowed a month's wages in advance, and the servant also paid the agency manager 30,000 yuan. This is how we managed to hire a servant. However, on the fifteenth day, exactly half a month, the servant suddenly changed her mind and told my wife, "My mother is sick and urgently needs me to return home to take care of family matters. I'm quitting." She grabbed her bag and left abruptly, without waiting for the owner's permission. Most strangely, the next day, that agency manager even came to visit her. Now, my family has no servant, and my wife does all the housework herself, saving anger and frustration. I vow never to hire a servant through an employment agency again.

### Celestial Master Zhang Encounters a Ghost in Broad Daylight

— Yan

Zhang Tianshi, the 63rd generation of the Celestial Masters from Longhu Mountain in Jiangxi, recently embarked on an expedition to Wuxi, staying for just over a month. He gained both fame and fortune and formed many connections with local figures. Printing a seal costs 50,000 yuan, a surprisingly high sum. At one banquet, Magistrate Xu jokingly asked the Celestial Master, "I've long heard that the Celestial Master is skilled in magic, with the 'palm thunder' being your signature technique. Today, please demonstrate it to broaden everyone's horizons." The Celestial Master replied, "Palm thunder is used to dispel demons and is only visible to ghosts. It is absolutely invisible to the naked eye." His words were quite humorous. People say that "A Supreme Spirit Tablet knocked down Magistrate Xu." The Celestial Master initiated a ritual at the Jade Emperor Hall on Huishan Mountain to honor the "Martyrs Who Died in the Victory Against Japan" for several days. He also erected a high platform over four "zhang" tall in front of the city library, performing a grand "Flame-Mouth" ceremony. Observers emptied the streets, creating a sea of people. The ghost community also received the flavor of nectar, making it a joyous occasion for both humans and ghosts. The Celestial Master quietly left Wuxi. The reason for his departure is also quite interesting. One day, while performing rituals on Huishan Mountain, a village woman, around thirty years old, wearing a blue "qipao" and black cloth shoes, with glasses suggesting she was not unintelligent, approached the Celestial Master's attendant claiming, "I am under the order of a certain Elder Master to see the Celestial Master." The attendant, sensing her improper intentions, tried to block her, but the woman immediately unleashed her magic, performing amazing feats on the mountain, such as "Running Horses Drinking Water," with impressive skill and technique. At this moment, the Celestial Master felt quite uneasy and secretly changed his clothes to descend the mountain, only to be grabbed by the woman. The Celestial Master exclaimed in surprise, "You are a heretical sect! If you wish to see me, you must follow the proper channels!" The woman shouted, "I am a demon! Why doesn't the Celestial Master capture me?" The Celestial Master was filled with shame. Later, the attendant pulled them apart, and the Celestial Master hired a car back to the city. The next day, he left Wuxi and returned to Shanghai. People say that "Huishan Mountain was originally an area where the Xiang clan's graves were concentrated. That woman was either a witch or a ghost. Celestial Master Zhang encountered a ghost and had no way to use his powers, which is also an interesting story."

### Head-On Collision

— Zou Shangchang

In this era, the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer. Money can truly make the devil turn the millstone. I truly gained much insight on my trip to Tianjin. Most of the people on the ship I took were soldiers heading north; there were very few other passengers. I pleaded and begged, finally managing to get a ticket. More than 200,000 yuan only got me a third-class cabin. The deck was so crowded that there was barely any standing room. To buy a berth, one would have to pay 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Two "x x x" on the same ship spent 100,000 yuan to buy two canvas cots to sleep on. "x x x" really got a bargain. When the ship arrived in Tianjin, the two "x x x" took their canvas cots to go ashore, and the steward panicked.

"Sir, you can't take the cots!"

"What? I spent 100,000 yuan to buy two canvas cots. I think I got ripped off! Why can't I take them?"

So they started arguing. "x x x" are "x" people after all, and the steward had no choice. Besides, on the ship, "x x x" are the bosses. So, the steward backed down and started negotiating the price. In the end, the steward refunded 60,000 yuan to settle the matter.

This can truly be called a head-on collision, black eating black.

### Father (Part 2)

— Ge Chunliang

The hand holding the money trembled violently. Tears streamed down my face, blurring my vision. I vaguely saw my mother standing before me. I didn't know how to thank her. I was truly grateful to her. I never thought she would endure the pain of giving up her prized possession for our sake. Alas! How can such insignificant grass repay the brilliance of spring?

"Liang, time to go to school," my mother's voice sounded more pleasing to me then than even the most beautiful music in the world.

"Okay, Mom, I'm going!" I felt a pang of sadness. On the way, I kept wiping my eyes with my handkerchief.

Last winter, although my father had a job, prices were soaring, and his income barely covered expenses, leaving no extra money for tuition.

And because it was the end of the year, debts were being pressed from all sides. My father's efforts to manage often involved suppressing the cold ridicule and abuse from creditors, and he gradually lost his smile. Finally, he even disappeared completely.

What about tuition? We had to find a way again. My father was busy running around outside day and night, talking and negotiating with his friends. Although he never mentioned it to me, I secretly knew that he was working hard for our tuition!

From his dejected attitude and disheartened expression, I could sense the results of his efforts.

Father often worried about our tuition. There were six of us in school. My second brother was quite worldly and didn't often mention tuition to Father. My third and fourth sisters and brothers often nagged Father, "Dad, the teachers at school said that if we don't pay our tuition soon, we won't be allowed to attend." "Dad, why haven't you paid our tuition yet? Maybe they won't accept it later."

Although Mother often stopped them, the stubborn siblings often didn't listen, sometimes making Father angry.

One day, I said to Father, "Dad, let me go into business. Tuition has increased again..."

"There are only six more months until you graduate."

That evening, Father bought four lottery tickets for the drawing the next day. Father was not a believer in fate, and he hated gambling. I had never seen him buy anything like this before, so it made me feel strange, and I couldn't help but wonder for a long time.

Lying in bed at night, I tossed and turned, unable to sleep. The surroundings were quiet, without a sound, except for the ticking of the clock singing a poem. Suddenly, I heard my father's delirious mumbling.

Father said, "Liang, did the lottery tickets win?... "

Silence.

"Did we win the first prize, or the second prize? Take it to pay the tuition for your younger brothers and sisters, too..."

Father turned over, and the garbled sound disappeared. I strained my ears to listen, but I didn't hear anything.

I couldn't hold back any longer. I hugged my pillow and cried loudly. Father's love for us moved me deeply! What more could I say!

The next day, the lottery numbers were announced, and none of the tickets had won. But Father nonchalantly said, "This kind of thing is inherently a scam. Of course, it won't win."

When school started, Father still gave me the tuition and told me to pay it. I didn't dare ask him where the money came from.

One Sunday, after Father went out, Mother secretly told me, "Your father kept telling me not to tell you about this, but I think it's okay to tell you. This time, your tuition was paid for by your father pawning two fur robes. You should study harder!"

Before Mother could finish speaking, I rushed out.

In the sharp, cold wind, I saw my father's shrinking, shivering figure, struggling, fighting against the sharp northwest wind in the cold. At that moment, there was nothing else on the road.
