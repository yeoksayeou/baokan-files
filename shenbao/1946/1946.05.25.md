### Bowles Arrives in Beijing from Korea Yesterday to Investigate the Allocation of Northeast Japanese Assets and Reparations

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Mr. Bowles, advisor to President Truman on reparations, and his party of five, arrived in Beijing this morning at 10:00 AM via special plane from Korea.

[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] Truman's reparations commissioner, Bowles, arrived in Nanjing from Seoul today. While greeting reporters, he stated that after consulting with Special Envoy Marshall and Premier Song Ziwen, he would establish an office in Lianyungang to investigate the production of heavy materials and products in the nine provinces, to assist with the industrial recovery of the Far East. A reporter asked: What action will be taken regarding the removal of machines from the Northeast? He replied: The main purpose of establishing an office in the Northeast and going to the Soviet-occupied zone in northern Korea is to investigate Japanese assets abroad and see if they have been removed by anyone. This matter certainly cannot escape our notice. The Shenyang office will be established by Bowles' aide, Colonel Mayes. Mr. Bowles will go to Beiping tomorrow to consult with the Sino-American military authorities. An office is also planned to be established in Korea. Bowles will travel between the two locations and expects to complete his mission in less than a month. Regarding the Soviet removal of military industrial equipment, it is said that he does not wish to express any opinions before going to the Northeast to ascertain the facts. Bowles is scheduled to fly from Beiping to Shanghai on the 26th, return to Korea on the 27th, and then go to the Soviet-occupied zone in northern Korea again on the 28th. It is expected that it will take one month at most, and half a month at least, to complete the work in both places. Bowles admitted that the detailed plan for the investigation in North Korea has not yet been finalized. As for whether Bowles will go to the Communist-held areas in the Northeast, he will ask Special Envoy Marshall to negotiate on his behalf, depending on the outcome. The Nationalist forces have agreed to provide all kinds of conveniences. Regarding the Japanese reparations issue, Bowles said that the percentage each country should receive has not yet been determined, but the second step after the investigation will be to decide on this matter. China can expect to receive a majority of the machinery and equipment, which may include former military aircraft, metals, steel, chemicals, and any equipment using machine tools.

All equipment from public and private naval shipyards will be allocated as reparations materials for shipment. Machinery in military shipyards will be sealed pending future arrangements. Japan will be allowed to retain shipbuilding equipment to build 150,000 tons of merchant ships per year, and to service a total of 3 million tons of merchant ships (including repairs). The Far Eastern Commission's plan also stipulates that Japan may retain two docks of 20,000 tons each to service foreign ships.

Editorial

### Hurry Up and Voluntarily Expand Thrift!

In the recent issue of the American magazine "Time," under the heading "Ladies' Champagne and Silk," there is the following record: "The headline of the Shanghai Great American Evening Post: Famine is becoming more serious, and thirty million people in China are facing starvation. Under a cloudy sky, eighty guests sat in comfortable armchairs waiting for Mrs. Carine's first postwar fashion show. Gathered on Mrs. Carine's spacious and soft lawn were the flamboyant figures of Shanghai's international society. The wife of an American oil company executive arrogantly walked in wearing a new spring outfit, and an icy Russian young woman sat like a Raphael Madonna wearing a striking blue turban. Half of the guests were Chinese, all gorgeously dressed. In the bygone era of extraterritoriality, they had never been invited to Mrs. Carine's fashion salon; but now Mrs. Carine's customers are 'a group of prominent Chinese.' Mrs. Carine said, 'They are very, very rich, very, very extravagant people.' The foreign ladies, very carefully, sat apart, indifferently welcoming this new era. The Great American Evening Post said that about four million people hardly get any relief and fear they will not survive this unprecedented disaster...'" This is an extremely interesting and, in the eyes of us Chinese, a very shameful account. Under the famine disaster raging in various parts of China, Mrs. Carine served champagne to the ladies present, and more than half of them were Chinese ladies, watching Mrs. Carine enthusiastically unfold the scene of her fashion show; what a satire this is on China!

According to another news report, according to unofficial figures released by the customs authorities, in January of this year, the total value of goods imported into this city was 9.38286432 billion legal tender, which increased to 15.17332728 billion yuan in February, and further increased to 44.20843432 billion yuan in March; on the export side, it was 5.64181394 billion yuan in January, and the import-export difference in that month was less than one time. In February, the value of exports decreased to 3.30896433 billion yuan, and imports exceeded exports by nearly three times. Exports increased slightly in March, amounting to 4.46257159 billion yuan, but they still did not catch up with the export amount in January, and the distance from the import value in the same month was even greater, with a difference of nearly ten times. In other words, the ratio of imports to exports in March was ten to one. Although the figures for April and May have not yet been announced, it is expected that the current imbalance in China's international balance of payments will be even more serious than before. According to bankers: Taking the Bank of China as an example, the daily settlement of US dollars is about 100,000 yuan or more. Except for a small amount of chemical raw materials and American cotton, most of the imported goods are "glass wallets" and the like; at the same time, almost no one cares about exporting. We do not know what the government authorities think after reading this report. Has their policy of stifling production reaped such serious consequences, and should they bear the responsibility? We don't even know if the ladies, after reading this report, feel a slight twinge of pain in their hearts when rushing to buy "glass wallets" and the like?

What a serious and painful picture the customs report paints! The ratio of imports to exports is ten to one, and this situation will become more and more serious. "Living off one's reserves" - what a crisis threatening the survival of our nation! Under this economic crisis, under the nationwide famine, the prominent Chinese ladies in Shanghai are in the mood to sit comfortably on Mrs. Carine's lawn, drinking champagne, appreciating the new clothes made by this Russian lady, scrambling to buy the spring clothes made by this lady at the cost of thousands of US dollars; while hundreds of thousands, even countless, victims in various parts of China are dying of starvation. We are appealing for overseas relief, but the prominent ladies are drinking champagne. This passage in "Time" magazine makes every Chinese person ashamed to death. Really, every Chinese person must rise up to curb this decadent trend, to preserve some integrity for our country and nation. This is the duty of every Chinese person. Facing the current economic crisis, serious famine, and decadent trend of extravagance and debauchery, we call on the people of the whole country to voluntarily practice thrift and overcome the current difficulties with austerity. We cannot allow this trend of luxury and waste to continue!

It is only for these reasons that we have written articles calling on everyone to practice thrift and hoping that the people will consciously and voluntarily rise up to practice thrift. Since we shouted the slogan "Let everyone practice thrift," we have seen the arrival of the new mayor. At the beginning of his tenure, this new mayor hoped that citizens would voluntarily save. At the welcome banquet of the Hubei Fellow Villagers Association, Mayor Wu expressed three points, one of which was to hope that citizens would unanimously promote the thrift movement. However, some people think that the small matter of thrift cannot remedy Shanghai's municipal administration, and some people even think that Shanghai is an international city, and social occasions cannot be too shabby, so it should not advocate thrift at all. These insane people are almost soulless! We once said: "If the thrift movement is to succeed, it does not lie in the strict control of the government, but in the voluntary compliance of the people... it all depends on the people being able to consciously and voluntarily rise up to be thrifty... Rather than the government formulating prohibitions, it is better for all sectors of society to voluntarily formulate three chapters of the law and abide by them mutually... We want to encourage everyone to compete in thrift, and correct the vain concept of competing in extravagance." We feel regret that the mayor's advice and our appeals have not seen any response so far, and all sectors of Shanghai society have not yet voluntarily started to practice thrift. Does this indicate the numbness of Shanghai people? Definitely not. There are many people in Shanghai who understand righteousness and fear being behind others in loving the country. This thrift movement is to correct the decadent trend of competing in extravagance, so as to preserve some vitality for the country and the nation. No one in Shanghai should be unwilling to voluntarily promote it. However, the fact that the citizens' thrift movement has not been promoted and unfolded is a fact, and we cannot continue to procrastinate. We must quickly and voluntarily launch a city-wide thrift movement. Waiting for the government to issue prohibitions and then promote thrift will ultimately be a disgrace to the people of Shanghai.

Citizens of Shanghai! Shanghai is the number one city in the country. We must set an example for the national thrift movement. We should quickly and voluntarily rise up to promote this movement. Citizen leaders should take the lead in advocating it and mobilize all communities and strata to promote this thrift movement. We must live up to the expectations of this new mayor for us!

Correction: In the second editorial of this newspaper yesterday, under the title "Concentrate on Solving Major Issues," the words "Xie Yunyi" were superfluous. Therefore, it was not an essay written by Mr. Xie. We hereby make a correction. - Editor.

### National Train Transportation Halted, American Railway Workers Go on General Strike, Government Immediately Manages Other Transportation Tools, Truman Convenes Emergency Meeting

[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd, United Press] The railway strike conference held at the White House ended in failure after eight hours of discussion. The strike leaders still ignored President Truman's proposed solution. President Truman's labor problem Steilman said: He hoped the strike could be resolved tomorrow, but both labor and management said that the meeting made no progress. Only a few trains were running across the United States tonight, and the drivers were all non-union members. Thousands of passengers were stranded in various railway stations, and the food problem threatened major factories. Various industries were seen to be shutting down, and all commerce was also suspended.

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Workers on 337 American railway lines have indeed begun a general strike at 9:00 tonight (6:00 AM, Shanghai Summer Time, 24th). At the same time, President Truman held emergency consultations with representatives from both labor and management at the White House to seek a solution. The White House did not announce any decision when 250,000 members of the two railway worker unions began the strike. Several hours before the strike began, major railway lines had already begun canceling services, leaving tens of thousands of passengers stranded en route. In New York, many passengers boarded the last train, climbing through the windows into the passenger cars. Almost 6,000 people rushed to catch the train at New York Central Station, with those boarding and those disembarking jammed together in extreme disorder. The trains on Long Island, which carry 250,000 workers back and forth to work every day, were also canceled before the strike began, and tens of thousands of workers were stranded in New York City. The government immediately managed transportation tools other than railways to transport food and mail. All trucks, buses, airplanes, ships, and railways that continued to operate were ordered by the government to use their equipment to ensure passenger and freight transport to the greatest extent. Except for emergency supplies, all freight transport has been prohibited. The wave of 100,000 railway workers began in July last year, when twenty unions demanded a wage increase of up to two dollars and fifty cents per day. Eighteen unions agreed to submit the dispute to arbitration, but the two unions of drivers and conductors, with a total of 250,000 members, advocated a strike on May 18. The strike order was canceled at the last minute due to the establishment of a five-day truce agreement, but the eastern railways were already in chaos before officially receiving the suspension of the strike. A chaotic scene at railway stations in major cities, with thousands of passengers rushing to catch the last train, turning back due to the early cancellation of services, and wartime carpooling quickly resumed between towns.

In addition, according to mining spokespersons, coal mines have had to suspend operations within 24 hours due to a lack of vehicles. Of the 4,500 bituminous coal mines, 90% of those that use railway transportation are affected by the strike.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 23rd] The White House held another meeting today to discuss new contract terms to completely resolve the miner strikes.

### Spanish Troops Total 840,000

Report by the Prime Minister of the Republican Government

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 23rd] The Subcommittee on the Spanish Question of the United Nations Security Council held a meeting today, and the Prime Minister of the Spanish Republican Government, Mr. Quiwell, attended the meeting to present his views. The Chairman, Australian representative Mr. Hasluck, asked Mr. Quiwell: Regarding the memorandum stating that the Spanish army has a total of 840,000 officers and men, excluding the police, the internal guard, and the Falange. Are the Spanish Navy and Air Force included? Mr. Li immediately replied "Yes". Brazilian representative Mr. Savero Guanaqi asked: What is the total number of the Spanish Army, Navy, and Air Force? Mr. Ki replied: Because the internal guard and police are constantly changing, it is difficult to determine the total number. Taking the Falange as an example, there are 500,000 people. In addition, there are other troops, such as the Carabinieri and border guards, all of which are under the command of the Army General Staff. Not only that, Franco recently ordered the people to be allowed to carry firearms, making it even more impossible to count.

This situation is particularly severe in major cities, which is worrying. In order to solve the current situation, the government has taken urgent measures, which goes without saying. At the same time, the people of Japan should also be prepared to endure hardship, help each other, and overcome difficulties. Japan has suffered from war and the scars are still there, and I cannot bear to ask the people to fast and suffer again. But without this, all our postwar efforts will be wasted. And our great and sacred work of rebuilding a peaceful and civilized country and helping to promote world progress will not be realized. I hope that the people of the whole country can abide by the excellent traditional spirit of the Japanese family and nation, abandon personal interests, overcome the current crisis, and move towards the path of revival and nation-building.

(United Press, Tokyo, 24th) The Emperor's speech was pre-recorded in the palace yesterday and broadcast three times today at noon, 7:00 PM, and 9:00 PM.

### A Japanese Royal Family Member Wants to Be a Chauffeur

[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, 24th] After MacArthur ordered the stripping of the privileges of the Japanese royal family yesterday, reporters visited Prince Kayo no Miya Tsunenori, a former lieutenant general in the army, to ask about his new life in the future. He replied that he has always advocated a simple life. After his private residence was subjected to a military coup last March, he rented eight rooms from the Hiroike family to live in. There were no guards, and only four or five scholars lived with him. Therefore, he does not feel bitter about how this order will affect him. He also said that he often drove a car during his time in the army. This April, he applied to the police station for a driver's license, so he will be helpful in making a living when necessary. However, employment is related to the imperial family and the imperial regulations, and because he was a soldier in the past, it will be very difficult. Currently, he needs about 10,000 yuan per month for expenses. In addition to reducing servants, he also needs to consider fundamental countermeasures. In short, he will abide by the principle that those who do not work shall not eat and live the same life as the people.

As for the armed forces that the Security Council should have, they have not yet been discussed. According to the Soviet representative, he did not receive instructions from the government when he left the Soviet Union, and so far, he has not received instructions from the government.

### America Invents Germ Weapon with Greater Power than Atomic Bomb Capable of Destroying All Life in Major Cities

[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] It is rumored that America's most secret weapon is a germ that can wipe out major cities and grains in one fell swoop, "its harm far exceeding that of the atomic bomb." Staff member Thomas mentioned this new weapon for the first time in the Senate yesterday, without going into details. Members of the House Appropriations Committee recently revealed the nature of the new weapon to the press, and briefly described its power as above. It was also said that the full details of the germ weapon can be known when the Appropriations Committee listens to the report on the $463,718,000 Navy expenditure plan. A certain member stated: Several types of germ weapons have already been developed to the stage where they can be used at any time if necessary. Only the United States knows the secret of this weapon, and its power can wipe out all life in major cities. When used, it is spread by aircraft, and the aircraft can be in the air without being threatened by ground artillery fire. Once the germs are spread, living things are quickly infected and there is no hope of survival. Although the detailed facts are not yet known, it is quite certain that the germ is highly contagious and can probably be spread by bombs. Another type of germ weapon can wipe out five grains in one fell swoop, and even the seeds in the soil will not grow again. "Perhaps mankind has not yet understood that there will be no victor in future wars unless we can forever prevent war, otherwise human civilization will be destroyed." According to reports, the US Navy recently disclosed that it has been engaged in germ warfare research at the University of California, and is currently studying a disease that has "hundreds of years of history and is extremely deadly." Various parties speculate that this statement refers to the Black Death.

### Scientists from Various Countries Gather in the United States to Study Atomic Energy Three Institutions Established at the University of Chicago, Including Ge Tingrui from Our Country

[Associated Press, Chicago, 22nd] Many scientists who have participated in atomic bomb research are now stepping up their efforts in peaceful projects, in order to have a clearer understanding of atomic energy, and not to aim at manufacturing rockets for travel to the moon. These scientists are now concentrating their talents on three newly established organizations at the University of Chicago, namely (1) the Institute for Nuclear Studies, (2) the Institute for Radiobiology and Biophysics, and (3) the Institute for Metals. Most of the researchers participated in wartime work, and came from Chicago and other universities, and there are also scientists from Norway, Poland, China, Britain, Italy, Germany and Hungary participating in it. According to Hutchins, President of the University of Chicago, this kind of organization will give the university a superior position in nuclear research.

Metallurgists, physicists and theoretical chemists, using the technology developed during the war, are formulating plans to determine the properties of metals at temperatures ranging from four hundred and fifty-nine degrees below zero to over five thousand degrees. Smith, from the University of Birmingham, England, was the leader of the group at the Los Alamos atomic bomb laboratory. His colleagues include Chersel-Eliason, who taught at the University of Oslo, Norway, and Skapski, who taught at Jagiellonian University and served as a consultant to the Polish steel industry.

### Pre-University Students at the Capital Provisional University Strike and Coerce Authorities Express That If the Strike Continues, They Will Resolve the Issue Thoroughly

[Special Report from Nanjing, This Newspaper] The pre-university students at the Capital Provisional University previously petitioned the Ministry of Education a week ago regarding the distribution issue. The Ministry of Education, based on the distribution method for pre-university students in the Great Rear Area (25% will be distributed to those who have completed one semester, 50% to those who have completed two semesters, and those whose grades do not meet the standards will apply to various universities themselves), Vice Minister Hang went to the class to give a speech, saying that due to the timely return of the National Central University's school buildings, the semester was ended early. As for the distribution standards, those whose grades meet the regulations will be allowed to be recommended for further study according to 50%. The students were satisfied with the resolution. Unexpectedly, at 8 a.m. on the 22nd, when the class was scheduled to take the final exam, a small number of students organized a patrol team to prevent other students from taking the exam, demanding that the Ministry of Education first announce the names of the universities to be distributed and the number of students they will accept. As for the remaining 50%, they wanted a clear announcement of the settlement plan. Because the majority of the coerced students demanded guarantees, the Ministry of Education requested more than a dozen unarmed military police to come to the scene to maintain order.

Vice Minister Hang Received Reporters

At 6 p.m., Vice Minister Hang also received reporters from various newspapers, and Director Zhou of the Higher Education Department, Counselor Liu Yingshi, and Supervisor Peng Baichuan reported on the student strike and the pre-university student distribution methods. They said that the pre-university students at the Capital Provisional University had already been treated favorably (50% of those who completed one year of pre-university studies in the inland areas were distributed), and it was imperative. Vice Minister Hang also said that the pre-university student distribution methods had been implemented in the rear areas for several years, and no students had ever made unexpected demands or distributed more than 50%. Moreover, since the borrowed school buildings needed to be returned to the original owners urgently, the semester had to be ended early. Although the semester was ended early, those who studied for a short period of time could still obtain 50% distribution. Those who did not meet the standards could apply to universities themselves. Those who had no home to return to could register for relief at the Ministry of Education's Youth Employment Guidance Office. The Ministry of Education loves young people, and young people should follow the rules and participate in the exams. The Ministry of Education is determined not to follow the students' demands and will make legal and reasonable arrangements. Director Wang Shulin of the cram school also came to the scene to report that the class, on the recommendation of the professors' meeting, would postpone the exam for the cram school students from the 24th according to the original procedure. If the students had any further problems, the professors would resign en masse. On the same day, a portion of the pre-university students, more than 60 people, participated in the exam. Most of the others were coerced and unable to take the exam. That night, the students gathered again. The faculty and staff of the class repeatedly tried to persuade them to no avail, and even wanted to attend the students' meeting, but were rejected by the students, who said that this meeting was special and did not invite them to participate. On the morning of the 23rd, another portion of the students, more than 60 people, participated in the exam. Among the remaining 600 or so people, some were coerced and did not dare to take the exam. The students who took the exam mostly took their luggage from the Wenchangqiao dormitory and came to the Central dormitory. Only when there were a considerable number of people did they dare to take the exam. However, outside the classroom and upstairs, the students who opposed the exam shouted and cursed. The faculty and staff of the class believed that order was not easy to maintain, and it was heard that if there was still noise and disruption on the 24th, the exam would no longer be held.

Faculty and Staff Received Reporters

At 3 p.m. on the 23rd, the faculty and staff of the class held a reception to receive reporters from various newspapers. Chen Jiefu, Mai Bingru, and Gao Hongkui, three faculty and staff members, reported that the faculty and staff had repeatedly persuaded the students. There were two petitions before, and after the faculty and staff tried their best to persuade them and Vice Minister Hang came to the class to give a speech, allowing them to be recommended for further study according to 50%, the matter was concluded. Recently, they again demanded that the Ministry of Education issue a clear announcement for the 50% distribution, and at the same time, a clear announcement of a proper settlement plan for the remaining 50% of the students, as well as the faculty and staff's various persuasions and hopes. On the same morning, a portion of the pre-university students gathered and went to the cram school to talk with the students. When they left, the military police saw a large number of people departing, so they followed them to the cram school and temporarily guarded the door. The military police dispersed shortly thereafter. The cram school students held a meeting, and the professors also held a meeting, wanting to persuade the students. The students only allowed one professor to participate and limited the speech to three minutes. The students had already stated that they would not take the exam on the 24th. Senior officials of the Ministry of Education, after hearing the report of Director Wang of the class, all believed that the students of the two classes had colluded and made unreasonable demands. They unanimously stated that they would take strict measures in accordance with the law. If the strike continued, they would issue a public order to thoroughly resolve the issue in order to rectify the academic atmosphere. (Yu)

### Responding to Readers: Medicine and Health

(1) Huang Wenshu asks: I read your "Medicine and Health" column every day and admire it greatly. Now I have a few questions to ask, and I believe your helpful spirit will surely help me solve them. I (female) am 21 years old and have been continuously gaining weight since I was 18, with no signs of stopping. This is not only unaesthetic but also hinders my mobility. I have tried various methods to prevent further weight gain, but all have been ineffective. (1) Is this weight gain a pathological condition? (2) What injections or medications can remedy it? (3) Is restricting food intake effective? (4) Can eating starchy foods help reduce weight? (5) Will eating meat increase weight? (6) What effect do vegetables and fruits have on weight?

(Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers): Abnormal weight gain is caused by dysfunction of the endocrine glands in the body. The treatment requires a full physical examination to determine the cause. Restricting food intake is not necessarily effective, but eating less meat and fat, eating more vegetables and fruits, and regular exercise can prevent excessive weight gain.

(2) Du Jiying asks: I was hospitalized in 1943 due to severe "sha-eye" (a type of eye disease). Although surgery was effective, it resulted in another more painful condition. Every one or two months, my vision becomes foggy, and I cannot read books, causing me great distress. What treatment is recommended?

(Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers): Your condition is likely deep "sha-eye" combined with keratitis. You should consult a specialist ophthalmologist for a detailed examination before treatment.

(3) Lu Guochang asks: Due to congenital deficiency, I developed later than others. Although I am an adult, I have no sexual feelings. At 19, I engaged in masturbation due to bad influences, which I quit after a year. Now I am 30 and have never experienced sexual urges. I have tried Western injections and Chinese "secret formulas," but all have been ineffective. What treatment and effective medication are recommended for this condition? I would be grateful if you could publish this in the newspaper so that others suffering from this condition can benefit.

(Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers): This is a case of sexual neurasthenia. Injections of male hormones or pituitary compound preparations are recommended.

(4) Chen Ruimei asks: Women generally fear being overweight, and I am no exception. I am a 16-year-old girl, and I used to be neither fat nor thin. However, after suffering from typhoid fever in the fall of my fifteenth year, I started gaining weight. If I continue to gain weight, it would be terrible. Therefore, I would like to ask you to help me solve this problem so that I can become slimmer. Also, my classmate is too short, so please tell her how she can grow taller. We thank you in advance.

(Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers): There are no specific medications for being overweight or too short. More exercise may be effective.

### Bulls Cash Out, Floating Capital Turns Around: Gold Prices Continue to Fall; US Dollar Absorbs at Low, but Still Weakens with the Gold Market

Yesterday, holders cashed out, resulting in an oversupply. The market opened weak and was immediately pressured by selling. There were rumors that the Central Bank had delegated full authority over market stabilization to Zhongdai Exchange. Bullish investors cashed out and gradually retreated to 1.83 million before a slight recovery. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank distributed 1.88 articles to dealers at a price of 1.845 million. Afterwards, it struggled around the allocation price for a long time. Near noon, the market rose to around 1.86 million due to abundant funds. The afternoon was similar. After 2:00 PM, there were no special changes in next-day delivery. Ornamental gold was 196,000, silver remained flat, and silver dollars fell slightly. The black market interest rate was slightly stable, ranging from 15 to 18 points.

The US dollar encountered continuous absorption at low prices, and many people needing foreign exchange had a hoarding mentality. However, the weakening gold market offered no support for price increases. The market opened at 2380 yuan and briefly fell to 2340 yuan. It recovered slightly at noon. In the afternoon, it struggled around 2360 yuan before finally closing at around 2350 yuan, a further decrease of 25 yuan. Hong Kong tickets remained sluggish, falling another 5 yuan. Hong Kong exchange rates were selling at 425 yuan due to the cessation of Indian cotton settlements, resulting in an oversupply. Indian exchange rates were 530 yuan. The official exchange rate for the US dollar remained flat, and the designated bank's selling price to a foreign firm fell slightly to 2060 yuan.

### Government Bonds Raised Again

Bond buyers acted together, and retail floating capital was encouraged by unfounded rumors that a certain bank was buying, causing them to join in. Tongbing bonds rose to over 7400 yuan after opening. Some bullish dealers released their holdings, causing a mid-session retreat to around 7050 yuan, but they were pulled up again near the close, resulting in a gain of 400 yuan. Other bonds used for arbitrage also rose by 400 to 500 yuan.

### Taiwan Company Officially Begins Sales: Sugar Market Trend Weakens

Yesterday, the sugar market saw a weakening trend in medium and fine granulated sugar as the Taiwan Company officially began sales. Over 9,000 bags were traded at a price of 66,000 yuan, delivered at the Yangjiadu Wharf in Pudong. Although the price was lower, the foreign exchange cost was very high. Sales will be conducted once a week thereafter. A total of over 50,000 bags of sugar have arrived for the company's shipments, with one-fifth already sold. The Association set the market price for medium and fine granulated sugar at 71,000 yuan to 70,500 yuan, down 1,000 yuan, and raw sugar at 59,000 yuan to 60,000 yuan. Numbered goods opened separately with little change.

### Continuous Source of Coal: Allocation of Coal Briquette Materials Continues

[Our Newspaper] The Hai Lie Lun arrived in port yesterday morning from Qinhuangdao with 9,000 tons of coal, which is currently being unloaded at the Sanjing Coal Yard.

Another report states that promoting the direct sales of white coal lump is proving difficult for the moment, with importers adopting a wait-and-see attitude. They hope the market price will fall further to facilitate sales. However, sellers are holding firm on prices due to high operating costs, preventing transactions from taking off. Only the bituminous coal factories are slightly absorbing small amounts, and trading is gradually becoming active. In addition, the Municipal Mechanical Coal Factory Association and the Hand-operated Coal Briquette Factory Joint Office have been approved for a second allocation of Annam Hongji white coal dust as raw material for briquette production by the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The price remains at 120,000 yuan per ton, delivered at the Pudong Wharf warehouse, and payment will be processed immediately.

### Significant Fluctuations in Yarn Prices: Spot Cotton Trading Suspended

Yesterday, yarn merchants still did not make large-scale purchases. Only inland merchants made some purchases. Prices for 20-count yarn saw mixed gains and losses, fluctuating between 5,000 and 10,000 yuan. Thread prices were also flat, with few transactions. At noon, Fangjian Textile Mill opened yarn sales as usual. Only 42-count Shuiyue thread and 20-count Shuiyue yarn were popular items. The former was listed at 2.43 million and the latter at 1.19 million, both slightly lower than the market price by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Unfortunately, supply was not sufficient, making it difficult to suppress yarn prices.

In the cotton market, New York American cotton ranged from 1 to 7 points above or below the average. Recent prices were 27.60, immediate prices were 28.25, and spot Mitling was 28.21. Spot cotton trading in Shanghai has completely stopped because gold is widely used downstream, causing manufacturers to remain cautious.

### Tea Market Stable

Specially selected tribute tea has been continuously purchased and shipped for export by various Indian trading houses in the city. Current interest in purchasing remains considerable, but suppliers are adopting a defensive attitude due to the scarcity of stock, resulting in a lack of transactions. Although local stores and merchants in Suxi and other areas are inquiring about domestic floral teas, suppliers are closely monitoring the situation, so there is little change in the trend.

### Independent Speculators Join Forces: Yong Yarn Becomes the Target; General Hope for a One-for-Three Bonus Share Issue

Yesterday, large money exchange firms concentrated their efforts on Yong Yarn, buying aggressively. Yong Yarn's gains were the strongest, overshadowing Meiya and other popular stocks. Opening high, Yong Yarn benefited from the afterglow of the previous evening. However, confidence was not strong, and the high price was unsustainable. Yong Yarn retreated from 5480 yuan to 5250 yuan, Meiya fell from 4300 to 4150 yuan, Jingfu dropped from 360 to 325 yuan, and Xinguang fell from 308 yuan to within 280 yuan. Qinxing retreated from 260 yuan to 232 yuan. However, floating capital in the financial sector continued to purchase Yong Yarn. The general expectation of a one-for-three bonus share issue drove up the stock. Other stocks were only dragged along passively. As a result, Yong Yarn rose 350 yuan, Meiya 100, and Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing rose slightly. Other stocks saw only minor gains and losses. In the afternoon, reduced prices in the over-the-counter market continued to be driven up by Yong Yarn. Foreign stocks were mainly driven by large bond dealers. Securities firms and operators remained on the sidelines, causing most stocks, except for the thriving Yi Yarn and English Union, to lose luster and fail to follow suit. Therefore, the popular Yi Yarn slightly fell near the close. Yi Yarn and English Union rose by almost half a percent, while others saw only minor gains and losses. After closing, the two popular stocks, Yi Yarn and English Union, were bid up slightly in the over-the-counter market.

### Forty-Five Train Engines Ordered from the United States

### Limited Sales of Woolen Fabrics

The trend in the woolen fabric market was calm yesterday, with few changes in standard prices. Although spring goods were particularly cheap, they lacked buyers. Summer goods maintained their status quo, with only sporadic purchases. Sellers lacked the strength to hold out for higher prices because the sales season was more than halfway over, and stores were unwilling to hold onto goods. Autumn goods were mutually absorbed when cheap, while winter goods saw very few transactions due to the distant sales season. Real sales at retail stores and menswear shops have recently decreased due to the arrival of summer and the lack of decline in the cost of living. Due to limited real sales, wholesale transactions are also lacking.

### Australian Wheat Exports

[United Press, Sydney, 23rd] Australian officials said that Australia will export to India and other Asian countries before November.

It is reported that a recent shipment of sausage casings was rejected due to substandard quality, with as many as fourteen barrels returned.

### Southeast Asian Rice Supply: 220,000 Tons Before June, 330,000 Tons Before September

### United States Raises Standards for Chinese Silk Uniformity

According to a recent telegram received by a certain export firm from the United States, the United States is now receiving a steady flow of raw silk from overseas, so the standard for uniformity of Chinese silk has been raised to 80 points or higher. Therefore, domestic silk manufacturers exporting to the United States are expected to export according to this standard.

Yesterday, there was no change in factory prices in Shanghai. User silk saw some transactions. Silk with a uniformity of 81 points was offered at 1.95 million to 2 million yuan per load. Foreign firms devalued silk with a uniformity of 78 points to 2.3 million yuan, but holders were unwilling to sell at the low price, so no transactions took place.

### Cotton Cloth Sales Quite Active

The cotton cloth market saw a rise in northern sales, with strong demand for 12-pound grey cloth. Grey cloth merchants raised prices by an average of 1,500 yuan per bolt compared to the previous day. Old 　　Anhui North's demand remains strong. 　　　Guangdong and Hunan continue to purchase various colored cloths, but indigo-dyed cloth has not yet been touched, so the situation is still calm. Transactions at retail cloth stores on the street are becoming more active. After noon, 260 bolts of Four Gentlemen Yuan Bijie were purchased by customers, raising the price by 1,000 yuan to 55,000 yuan. New goods rose 1,500 yuan to 53,250 yuan.

### Prefabricated Houses Soon to be Shipped to China

### Rice Merchants Reluctant to Set Prices First Yesterday Morning: Market Delayed for Two Hours; Stalled Situation Broken After Persuasion by Responsible Persons

The Qing Liange Rice Industry Temporary Market, with trading hours originally from 9:00 AM to noon, was delayed yesterday. Rice merchants, wary of the arbitrary price increases by Rong Yongming, manager of Wu Chang Rice Store, being questioned by the Social Affairs Bureau, were reluctant to be the first to set prices, observing for a long time. Subsequently, Wan Molin, chairman of the Rice Number Industry Association, Xing Zhigang, director of the market, Zhu Yongming, and others visited the market to persuade them. After conveying the authorities' intention to protect legitimate rice merchants, the stalled situation was broken, and trading resumed, but it was already past 11:00 AM. Therefore, only one hour of trading took place yesterday. There was slight absorption on the street, and trading was very light. The authorities are closely monitoring the situation in the rice market and will severely punish any attempt to speculate. As for Rong Yongming, manager of Wu Chang Rice Store, although bail has been granted, the authorities are determined to carefully examine his accounts. If manipulation is found, they will be strictly investigated according to the law to prevent emulation.

Rice Prices Slightly Lower

Yesterday's rice market saw weak supply and demand. Japonica and Indica raw rice both fell by 500 to 600 yuan. The oil market also saw no changes. Soybean sales were normal. Corn prices surged by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan due to increased demand from Qingdao. Yuan wheat also added 1,000 yuan, and wheat also rose by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan due to strong sales in Qingdao. According to the Rice Market, the amount of rice arriving in Shanghai yesterday was just over 6,000 shi.

Estimated Inventory

[Our Newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau's inventory registration ended yesterday. According to reporters, about 200 bean and rice businesses registered their inventory, with a total of about 70,000 shi. About 1,400 rice number businesses registered their inventory, with a total of about 120,000 shi. About 50 retail businesses registered their inventory, with a total of about 20,000 shi. It is understood that the above figures are not final, as some suburban businesses have not yet registered on time. However, the number is not large.

### First Batch of Foreign Rice Loaded: Chairman Su Shao Cables Production Areas Not to Hinder Food Circulation

[Central News Agency, This City] It is reported that the foreign rice purchased by the Ministry of Food has been loaded onto the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Su wheel in Haiphong and shipped to Shanghai yesterday, totaling several thousand tons.

[Another Report] The Taihu Lake area, including Wuxi and Suchang, which produces rice, previously reported news of restricting the export of rice, which has affected Shanghai's supply. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau cabled the Jiangsu Provincial Government to stop it. A reply telegram was received from Chairman Wang: "After investigating, the counties such as Wuxi previously adopted registration methods to prevent illegal grain merchants from speculating and manipulating. This government has already cabled to correct this and ordered that the free circulation of food should not be hindered. In addition to instructing the county governments concerned to strictly comply, a special telegram has been sent for inspection."

Changchun, 29th Day (7th)
—Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Shao Shenzhi

The Soviet army in Changchun began to withdraw on April 7th, and the Soviet army at the West Airport withdrew on the evening of the 8th. At that time, key central government officials withdrew one after another, and news colleagues also left successively. We arrived in Changchun on the 9th, truly risking our lives to fly there, and not a single friend agreed with our approach. At that time, government personnel remaining in Changchun and Central News Agency's Liu Zhuzhou were ordered to stay in Changchun. At this time, everyone hoped that the government's regular army could be airlifted in a timely manner, because there were six days from the withdrawal of the Soviet army until the 14th. Everyone thought that if the regular army was stationed in Changchun, it could be firmly defended, and Changchun might even be spared a major battle. However, everyone waited eagerly, but there was no news of an airlift. As for the subsequent airdrop of ammunition that did not match the caliber, it also proved that the government army had no preparation whatsoever.

Post-War Reminiscences

Regarding Defense Commander Chen Jiazhen, he was a former Northeast Army cadre from the Shenyang Military Academy, and Chief of Staff Zhao Jiaxiang was a classmate of the Communist general Lü Zhengcao. In the past, he served as a senator in the Military Affairs Commission, and after the victory, he served as a major general senior staff officer in the Northeast Provisional Headquarters, and also as a member of the military delegation. Dong Yanping designated him to be in charge of military affairs before leaving, which seemed to be a decision made in haste. However, militarily speaking, temporarily taking control and commanding the security team is not an easy task. Moreover, the scale of this war was quite large, and Chen had no such experience in his past military life. However, Chen Jiazhen was firm, calm, and did his best to execute his duties, giving it his all.

Before the war, we visited various places to inspect fortifications. Changchun has many solid buildings that can be relied upon for resistance, but the security team also set up some reserve positions and obstacles. These fortifications were of course quite crude. On the evening of the 10th, two Soviet tanks suddenly drove in from the southern part of the city, turned to the Central Bank, stopped in front of the police headquarters, and then turned west. The barbed wire and crude fortifications were all destroyed. The next day we went to see them, only to find security team soldiers repairing them. Although Changchun has many institutions, they were all empty, and there was no unified organization. Faced with the tense situation, no one could command anyone. Zhao Junmai, the mayor of Hengyang, Liu Zhe, the director of the China Chang Railway Company, and Wang Jiazhen, a member of the Economic Commission, sent a joint telegram to Director Xiong on the 12th, requesting him to come in person to oversee the situation. But it was too late. After a major battle ended, we knew that Changchun was in ruins. The large buildings that remained relatively intact, except for the Yamato Hotel, were all destroyed. Only the Manchurian Coal Building was still unscathed. Forty percent of the city's buildings were gone, and at least 6,000 Chinese people died or were injured, including civilians and security team members.

Since the 19th, our life in Changchun could be said to be free, but not entirely free, and not entirely unfree either. The subtle difference between so-called freedom and unfreedom is truly extremely nuanced.

Mayor Captured

On the morning of the 19th, the gunfire was sparse. We asked the guarding Communist soldiers, and they said, "We don't know who's shooting." Later, a political instructor from a company came and said, "Kuomintang secret agents and traitors will fire shots at any time." But he also admitted that their own soldiers would also fire machine guns randomly, saying, "These are the new sounds of testing guns seized from the enemy."

As we were about to have breakfast, we suddenly saw Captain Cao of the Air Force Headquarters being escorted by several Communist soldiers. Cao was wearing a black cotton robe, with a Japanese military coat on top, looking very disheveled. Accompanying him was a section chief named Bai Juren, who was under the command of Major General Liu Qiren, the political instructor of the western siege force.

When Cao saw that Zhao Junmai was still alive, he was very happy. He said, "I haven't eaten, slept, or washed my face for a day and a night."

While washing up, he told us, "Liu Zhuzhou broke through with Commander Chen Jiazhen yesterday. Shao Shenzhi did not see him before the breakthrough. The fate of both is unknown." We were stunned, and our hearts were weeping silently.

Section Chief Bai, who accompanied Captain Cao, explained Liu Qiren's and Sun Zheng's intention to invite us to talk, and then said to Zhao Junmai, "Mayor Zhao, please come and talk too!" He already knew that Zhao Junmai was no longer Yang Huabai of the Ta Kung Pao.

Two cars of eight people drove through the city. We recognized that Liu Qiren's headquarters was the original General Post Office building.

The corridors on the second floor of the General Post Office building were filled with wounded soldiers, some cursing, some groaning, and others staring at us with strange eyes. Several Communist female soldiers, who spoke good Russian, thought the American reporters were Soviet people and came up to them, saying, "Россия, хорошо!" The American colleagues did not understand what they were saying. After translation, they said they were Americans, and the female soldiers became cold.

In the room at the end on the left, Section Chief Bai asked Mayor Zhao to wait there for a while, and asked us to talk to Liu and Sun first. Zhao had no choice but to obey and walked into that room. Shi Xun was curious and followed in, but saw Lai Bingquan, the director of the Provisional Headquarters, Wu Shiyi, the senior staff officer, and Zhang Datong, the secretary of the Economic Commission. We didn't say anything. Shi Xun made a face at Datong, and Datong gave him a wry smile.

We waited for about ten minutes. We were invited into a room with relatively bright light. The first to come out to meet us was Sun Zheng, who still wore a stern face, without a trace of a smile. Then Liu Qiren also came. He first expressed his condolences to us, and then explained that the situation had not yet stabilized, and for safety's sake, it was best not to go out. We asked him that we wanted to see new things and report new historical facts. He did not give us a definite answer. We finally asked him that we were willing to write a "letter of voluntary assumption of risk" stating that "if we lose our lives, it has nothing to do with you," because our identity was that of war correspondents. But he finally refused our request. He promised that if the situation improved, we could go out immediately. He promised to introduce us to General Zhou Baozhong, the supreme commander of the Communist army attacking Changchun, and he promised that we would have absolute freedom of interview. In an hour-long conversation, we didn't get anything. We only learned that Chen Jiazhen, the commander of the city defense, was wounded in the leg.

We walked out of the room, wanting to find Zhao Junmai to go back with us. Suddenly, Sun Zheng said, "Mr. Zhao is not going back today, we will be responsible for entertaining him." We knew that from today onwards, this Yang Huabai, who had disguised himself as a reporter for Ta Kung Pao, had been captured. But Zhao got along very well with us. Although he was straightforward, we all liked him. Elberna was heartbroken to see this old classmate from Wisconsin being separated from them. We asked to see him one last time before parting. With Sun Zheng's permission, we each shook Zhao's hand tightly, and everyone said "Take care" to each other, parting in sadness.

We Lost Our Freedom

The same car took us back. We asked the driver to stop and walked to the vicinity of Datong Square. We saw that the flames of the municipal government building had not yet subsided, and the heat was too intense to pass through.

We returned home as before. Zhao Junmai was gone, and the house had no owner, like a person who had lost their soul. Everyone was extremely melancholy, unable to find anything to start a conversation with. Shi Xun went into the bedroom, wanting to sleep. Unexpectedly, there was already someone sleeping in the bed. Flipping open the blanket, we saw that it was none other than Shenzhi. The two of us were stunned, unable to speak for a long time. Our joy overflowed in our strong embrace. Everyone was relieved to know that Shenzhi had returned and welcomed him back. Shenzhi was thinner in spirit, and he had suffered the same fate as Shi Xun in terms of material possessions. His belongings had been robbed six times, and he had also gone a day and a night without eating, sleeping, or washing his face.

We all agreed that our days of staying here would not be short. The immediate problems were food and servants. After dinner, we held a meeting and decided that all food and other expenses would be shared equally by the eight of us, and all five servants would be kept. At the same time, it was decided that Shi Xun would be in charge of food and Shenzhi would be in charge of accounting.

On the morning of the 20th, we were still waiting for Liu Qiren to send a car to allow us to go out and interview. But near lunchtime, another political instructor of a battalion came. The political instructors of the Communist army at the battalion and company levels were indeed not easy to deal with. They came in and talked about a long string of political theories, and we understood these political theories, or even knew them better than they did. Sometimes they treated us as Kuomintang spies, trying to trick us with words, and sometimes they treated us as uneducated soldiers who had been captured, using their consistent political theories to indoctrinate us. We really didn't want to listen, but we were embarrassed to ask them to leave. The more they talked, the more excited they became, and the more we listened, the more we hated it. We hated that they couldn't talk about anything new, hated that they didn't understand anything outside their political consciousness, and hated their arrogant and unreasonable attitude. These political instructors did not recognize our identity as reporters. In their eyes, we were superior prisoners of war. This aversion was completely different from the conversation we had with Kai Feng, the director of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the Communist Party of China.

For example, this political instructor insisted on emphasizing the Long March of the Red Army in the past. In fact, we understood this even more than he did. He said, "Our feet have replaced any means of transportation, so our feet are our glory." We had heard this sentence several times, and he couldn't say anything else besides expressing this point. We had no choice but to listen and deal with it perfunctorily. He seemed to feel bored when he saw that we were not getting excited and quietly left.

At lunchtime, Zhao Junmai returned with two Communist soldiers who were monitoring him. We were surprised, thinking he had been released. Later, we learned that he had come to get his bedding. From him, we learned that more than 30 government officials were imprisoned in Madame Chiang's residence. At that time, the house was still called Lü Mansion, which was the official residence of the puppet Manchu Minister Lü Ronghuan. In addition, he also told us about the safety of Major Reik, the military attache of the American Embassy, but he heard that the plane he had flown in on had been burned.

Unexpectedly, as Shi Xun was walking out of the courtyard, a Communist soldier's shiny bayonet was pointed at Shi Xun's chest, and he said menacingly, "You are not allowed to come out!" Shi Xun retreated. The other Chinese and foreign colleagues also knew about it. So we went to ask the soldier. He said, "The order from above is that you are not allowed to go out!" We knew there was no point in arguing with him. He openly fired his gun in the garden of our neutral journalist residence. We didn't say anything, we knew we had lost our freedom.

### A Letter of Protest - To General Zhou Baozhong

That night, we felt an unusual pain in our spirits. We didn't know what would happen in the future, because the development of the situation and the so-called "safety" and "protection" we knew were completely different. After dinner, we were no longer as comfortable as we had been the day before. Everyone sat around the table, playing the game of connecting English letters. Tonight, we made a very serious decision: to send a letter of protest to Zhou Baozhong, the Communist commander-in-chief of Changchun, tomorrow. This letter of protest was written in English, drafted by Lippmann of the New York Times, and after everyone agreed, we all signed our names and wrote the names of the different newspapers we represented.

The translated text of the protest letter is as follows:

'General Zhou Baozhong, Commander-in-Chief of the Eighth Route Army in the Changchun Area:

Several soldiers of the Eighth Route Army who are guarding us under your command have detained us for two or three days.

In the past, General Liu Qiren and General Sun Zheng told us that for our "safety", our movements were to be restricted. They also said that as soon as the battle of Changchun ended, we could move freely.

We are very grateful for their concern for our safety, but we have also pointed out to them that danger is an integral part of our work. We are war correspondents, and we have been through battles large and small in the East and West, defeating Japan and defeating Germany. We are very eager to interview the latest new openings, and danger is a common amusement for us.

Since we talked to them, we have found that the guarding soldiers have clearly told us in the execution of his order: freedom has disappeared under force. In this situation, we dare not have any hope, we only consider ourselves prisoners of the Eighth Route Army.

The battle in Changchun has long since stopped, and there should be no serious danger to our "safety" in the current situation. Therefore, we protest against the unreasonable detention. We have talked with many Communist personnel in Yan'an, Chongqing, Beiping, and we all feel that news coverage in the Communist areas is free. And welcome us to help us get the latest reports.

We now want to reclaim our rights. We would also like to talk to you, although we have met with Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Ye Jianying from the Communist side.

We also ask you to allow us to use the CCP's radio station to send a telegram to the Executive Headquarters in Beiping to send a plane to pick us up and hope that you will restore our freedom as usual."

The next morning (the 21st), Section Chief Bai came again. We asked him if he could forward this letter to Zhou Baozhong. He said, "It will definitely be delivered." Section Chief Bai Juren had been a Communist for only a year, according to what he told us. We didn't know if it was true or false, but we believed that he wouldn't tell us the truth, and we didn't believe that he had only joined the Communist Party for a year.

### Meeting Zhou Baozhong

When Bai Juren was about to walk out of the house quickly, Major Reich suddenly arrived, his pistol still at his side. We were overjoyed. We expressed our concern for him, and he said that the phone lines were down and the fighting was too intense, so he couldn't get through for a while. We temporarily forgot all the pain of being unfree, and everyone crowded around the round table again, asking the cook to add a few more dishes. Reich and Beckett drank heartily with vodka.

Major Reich liked Chinese food and had the forthright manner typical of Americans. When talking to him, he also had the beautiful and refined vocabulary of a diplomat. Everyone liked his humor and wit. So when he wanted to return to his residence at the Yamato Hotel, everyone refused to let him go and wanted him to stay with us.

At three o'clock in the afternoon, Section Chief Bai came again. He brought a letter, and we were surprised, thinking that Zhou Baozhong had written back to us so quickly. Upon opening it, we realized that Liu Qiren was inviting us to a "banquet" on behalf of Zhou Baozhong for tomorrow. There was no time, no address; it was a "strange" simple invitation.

Afterward, Bai Juren explained to Reich that Liu Qiren wanted to see him. Reich was also willing to see Liu Qiren because he wanted to know: (1) whether his plane was safe; (2) whether he could get some gasoline from the Communist side. He originally wanted to have Shi Xun go with him as his translator, but Bai Juren did not agree. He said, "General Liu can find an interpreter there." But Reich insisted, "If the interpreter is not good, I want you to bring Mr. Zhao." Before Reich said this, he first consulted Shi Xun's consent.

A quarter of an hour later, Shi Xun was taken to the Mantetsu Building in a jeep. This was Shi Xun's first, and also last, time to re-enter the gray building after the Changchun incident. At that time, the emotions were truly mixed, and it was difficult to express in words.

Shi Xun walked into Dong Yanping's former office. Everything was still almost the same as before. The only difference was that the corridors were crowded with many soldiers, who went into the washroom and left the faucets running. This lively scene was in stark contrast to the desolation, chaos, and fear of the headquarters after Dong Yanping left. Because after Dong Yanping left Changchun, the situation was critical, and all the sensitive central officials left Changchun one after another. The so-called recovering Changchun, recovering the hearts of 800,000 people in Changchun, was simply bragging. The dead, the wounded, the burned, and the losses, this debt of blood, was all on the heads of the common people.

Reich wanted to go to the airfield himself to see the plane. Liu Qiren could not make a decision. He just kept smoking Lequn cigarettes. Lequn cigarettes were top-grade among the local products of Changchun. The two sides argued for a long time, and Liu Qiren agreed to Reich negotiating with Zhou Baozhong.

So Bai Juren took us to Zhou Baozhong's place again. At that time, his headquarters were in a small factory. From the outside, it was impossible to tell that it was a headquarters. That house was in the direction of the Imperial Palace.

Zhou Baozhong agreed to Major Reich's request. Turning around, he said to Shi Xun, "Since Mr. Zhao represents a non-partisan newspaper and is a liberal, our conversation will be easier from now on."

Zhou then said, "I am indeed a little worried about your safety where you are staying. I have prepared a hotel for you now. After I send Major Reich back, I will send you to that hotel. Don't leave now. As for the other American and Chinese reporters, I have also decided to move them tonight." He said these words without first seeking Shi Xun's personal consent, nor respecting the individual freedom that the Communist Party had always proclaimed. Shi Xun fell silent and sat there solemnly, not expressing an opinion.

Reich didn't understand what Zhou was up to and wanted Shi Xun to explain it to him. When Reich understood what Shi Xun said, he immediately said to Zhou, "Mr. Zhao is someone I invited to help you and me communicate. I have the obligation to personally send him back. I think his accommodations there are very comfortable, something a hotel cannot match."

Finally, Zhou asked Section Chief Bai about our comfort. He agreed with Reich. It was already seven o'clock. Shi Xun came back, and everyone kept asking about the process before they could rest assured. (To be continued)

### A Bay of Green Water, Lychees Red on Both Banks: Early Summer Scenery of Lingnan

— Special Correspondent Liang Feng, Guangzhou Airmail, This Newspaper, 17th

When the kapok flowers on the top of Yuexiu Mountain have all fallen, and the fluff is scattered all over the sky, this tells the people of the South that summer has already arrived on the earth. The reporter once spent several summers in Chongqing, and in those places with a continental climate, it was really uncomfortable. This time, returning to the South, I couldn't help but have a completely different feeling; because in the early summer in the South, although the scorching sun hangs high in the sky during the day, shining strongly on people, once night falls, a gentle breeze blows, making the earth cool, eliminating all the heat of the day. Therefore, the "Spring of the South" is certainly lovely, but the "Early Summer of Lingnan" really has something attractive!

### Eat Three Hundred Lychees a Day, Willing to Be a Lingnan Person

Now lychees, mangoes, bananas, oranges, apples, peaches, plums, apricots, water chestnuts, pears... all kinds of things are available and have been successively put on the market! However, among these many fruits, the one that can represent this season and is worth introducing should be the lychee!

Regarding the sweetness and richness of the lychee, many people in history have praised it in poems, such as Du Mu's poem: "A rider raises dust, a concubine laughs, no one knows it's lychees coming!" and Emperor Huizong of Song's poem: "Jade liquid congeals like celestial dew, crimson buds form crystal beads." This shows that the ancients liked to eat lychees and described their color, taste, and sweetness. Bai Letian said in "Preface to the Lychee Garden": "The shell is like red paint, the membrane like purple essence, the flesh as white as ice and snow, the juice as sweet as wine, if separated from the branch, the color changes in one day, the fragrance changes in two days, and the taste changes in three days." From this, we also see that lychees cannot be tasted for their true flavor if they are separated from the branch for three days. Therefore, everyone says that Lingnan lychees are the best, probably because they are produced more here; in fact, all fruits are more delicious the fresher they are. Lychees eaten in places where they are not produced are naturally things that have been picked from the tree for more than three days, so how can they compare to eating them here so fresh? No wonder the Song poet Su Dongpo also said: "Eat three hundred lychees a day, I would not refuse to be a Lingnan person for life!"

When the lychees are red, a summer resort worth introducing here is Lychee Bay! That place is in the western suburbs of Guangzhou City, accessible by public bus, so transportation is still convenient. That bay is a small tributary of the Pearl River, originally the site of the historical Changhua Imperial Palace. Because the environment on both sides of the river is beautiful, many high officials and nobles built villas there, so people gradually discovered that it was a good place to play in the summer. Some water residents even built many elegant pleasure boats and sampans, so that tourists could hire boats to play. Soon, it became a scenic spot for people to visit in the summer. Lychee Bay is not as prosperous as the Qinhuai River, nor as quiet as the West Lake, nor as famous as Xuanwu Lake. However, its advantage is that there is no artificial rendering at all, purely a natural face. It also has a special feature, that is, lychee trees are planted on both sides of the stream. Every summer, bright red lychees hang on the trees, truly making people's mouths water, and Lychee Bay gets its name from this. In the past, someone described the scenery of Lychee Bay, saying "A bay of green water, lychees red on both banks." These two lines of poetry can be said to be a vivid and thorough description.

### Lychees Red on Both Banks of the Bay, Many Pleasure Boats on Moonlit Nights

Before the war, it was extremely lively there! On both sides of Lychee Bay, in addition to some villas with red walls and green tiles, there were also many amateur organizations, such as music societies, sports clubs, dance clubs, and clubs, etc., in abundance. One of the larger ones was the "West Suburb Swimming Pool," where there were at least three thousand "swimmers" every day. The most numerous were treasure ships and sampans, with more than two thousand boats, as well as countless small boats selling salted plums, selling food, selling boat congee, selling wonton noodles, selling ice cream, and singing, crisscrossing back and forth, peddling to tourists. There were also dozens of "Purple Cave Boats" selling wine and dishes, which were specially for high officials and nobles to entertain guests. The furnishings of these small boats were extremely luxurious, surpassing those of general land-based restaurants. Every time the lights were lit, one could see teams of pleasure boats and small boats, like ministers crossing the river, anchored under the shade of the lychee blossoms, whispering sweet nothings to each other. There were also families, large and small, bringing the old and the young, to enjoy the night scenery of Lychee Bay. They could also taste the boat congee after eating lychees, or eat one or two cups of ice cream, so-called mixing ice and snow lotus root, with great joy. There were also many young men and women, floating in the West Suburb Swimming Pool, like mandarin ducks playing in the water, while the high officials and nobles set up luxurious feasts on the "Purple Cave Boats," raising their glasses to the moon, with singers singing at the bow, which was even more of a situation of "singing to wine, how much is life."

### The Summer of Lychee Bay in the 27th Year of the Republic, Singing and Music Every Night

The summer of the 27th year of the Republic can be said to be the heyday of Lychee Bay. At that time, singing and music every night, wine green and lanterns red, all night long, it was truly a sleepless place. But after Guangzhou fell, that place became a forbidden area, because at that time the enemy stationed troops there to monitor the boats coming and going on the Pearl River, and on the opposite bank of Lychee Bay, our guerrillas often appeared, so the enemy had strict guards there, truly "no admittance for the living."

Last year, after Guangzhou was restored, the reporter went to Lychee Bay once, but it was just a case of "the face remains, but the peach blossoms are gone," no longer having the same scenery as in the past. The villas with green tiles and red walls of the past have become broken walls and ruins, tourists have disappeared, leaving the pleasure boats from seven or eight years ago, all "boats unmanned, lying across," silently tied under the lychee trees, gazing at the surface of the Pearl River, even more desolate, only worthy of lamentation.

### Lychee Bay Gained Freedom This Year, the River Water is Greener Than Before

This year, this Lychee Bay, which seems to have spent seven long years in prison, has now regained its freedom! Look! This year, the river water in Lychee Bay seems to be greener than before, and the lychees on both banks are even more vividly red and bright. Elegant yachts have been increasing one after another, the small boats selling food have also returned to their original state, and someone is also starting to build the West Suburb Swimming Pool. All of this shows the new atmosphere of Lychee Bay. Friends, if you come to Guangzhou and don't visit Lychee Bay, that is truly your loss!

(May 17th, in Guangzhou)

### The Great Wall on the River in Anhui Province, on Which the Lives and Property of Four Million People Depend: The Completion of the 200-Li-Long Wuhe River Embankment

— Correspondent Bai Yuwen, Wuhu, This Newspaper, 20th

Concerning the lives and property of four million people, the Wuhe River Embankment in the seven counties of Hefei, Chaoxian, Shucheng, Hanshan, Lujiang, Wuwei, and Hexian in southern Anhui Province, is 200 li long, equivalent to 110 kilometers. Before the war, it often breached due to tides and floods. After the war, the enemy built bunkers and dug trenches, causing even more collapse. The height was also below the water level of the 20-year flood. At the beginning of the establishment of the Anhui Relief Branch, it was deeply aware of the importance of this project, so it re-built it in the form of work-for-relief, in order to advance relief and rehabilitation at the same time. After initial team measurement, construction started on the entire line on May 28th. The types of the entire embankment project were: new embankment construction for the original embankment that had collapsed too severely; dangerous work for embankment bodies that were too low, below the flood level, or partially damaged too severely, requiring major repairs; plain work for the original embankment that was still intact, but needed to be raised and thickened for consolidation; pond work for bailing water and filling mud to cultivate the beach; and sand work for picking sand and soil or removing sand accumulation from the original embankment foundation. The construction standards were stipulated as: (1) raising one meter above the 20-year flood level; (2) minimum width of eight meters; (3) inner slope ratio of 1:2; and outer slope ratio of 1:3. This embankment work was for relief purposes, and the recruitment of labor was targeted at the poor. A total of 73,139 civilian laborers and embankment laborers were recruited, with 22 people in a squad, three squads in a company, and three companies in a battalion. The district township chiefs served as squad leaders and were responsible for distributing flour. The flour was distributed at a rate of one jin per cubic foot, distributed every five days. In addition, clothing relief was provided, with a total of 180 packages of used clothing distributed. Those with better performance were given double rewards. Therefore, in just 50 days of construction, the great Great Wall on the river, the greatest embankment project in history, was completed. The Relief Branch specifically held a grand completion ceremony on May 20th, and also invited the leaders of all sectors and the press here, taking a special ferry across the river to participate in the ceremony.

### We Need "Literary Correspondence"

— Editor-in-Chief

Recently, Western-published magazines have seen the rise of a type of magazine called "news magazines," and some people in our country are also calling for "news magazineization." I don't think these names, "news magazine" or "news magazineization," easily reveal their nature to us. Generally speaking, the articles published in magazines use a light and literary style to narrate the news using the techniques of writing magazine articles, which is different from ordinary news reports.

I think the term "literary correspondence" is more appropriate. However, the name "literary correspondence" can sometimes be interpreted as the kind of writing that reports literary news or literary trends. Here, of course, news is the main body, the content, and the use of literary techniques is only a matter of skill.

Literature is emotionalized and visualized through people's feelings and imagination. It can satisfy people's strong inner demands and is an indispensable spiritual supplement for everyone. It can nourish our desolate mood and cultivate the vitality that life urgently needs. If we want to strengthen people's understanding of the world situation and help people understand the real social life, the most effective method is to launch a "literary correspondence" movement, advocating the use of literary methods to report on the objective social situation at this stage and the dynamics of key figures in the current situation.

A boring piece of news will never be as moving as a vivid literary correspondence, because people's hearts have already aroused a strong demand when reading "literary correspondence," and they feel an unspeakable pleasure, which is incomparable to ordinary news. Therefore, in order to complete the highest task of news reporting, we should create a common atmosphere of "literary correspondence" and penetrate all levels of society.

Now many people are demanding that literary writers take a realistic path. Literature is a reflection of real society. What else can be expressed if it is separated from the "people" and "things" that exist vividly in society? The most important task of news reporting is to record the living "people" and "things" in the living society, which is also the task that literary writers should undertake. Therefore, those who aspire to engage in literary creation can work hard in the field of "literary correspondence."

Good "literary correspondence" can also provide writers with rich material, allowing them to get closer to reality and better express the living "people" and "things" in this living society through emotional and imaginative creation. If the author can use the precise observation of interview news to portray real life, they will definitely be able to produce works with flesh and blood. In this way, literary correspondence can not only serve as a reference for literary authors, but also deepen their writing skills through this training.

We hope that the news media and magazines will promote the "literary correspondence" that most people need today.

Book Review

### History of the Second World War

— Wang Ciqing

Author: Chu Yukun Publisher: Yongxiang Printing House

In the past, our country's writing circles have relied on foreign works for works on world history. The so-called works are just compilations and translations. It is rare to find a book that completely relies on one's own perspective to compile and write a history book from historical materials from various countries in the world. The several general histories of the West, histories of World War I, and modern histories of the West published in our country all have blueprints. From this point of view, we can also know the immaturity of our country's writing circles.

The author of the History of the Second World War, Chu Yukun, from September 1, 1939, to August 15, 1945, collected materials at any time during these full six years and wrote down what he had researched. For six years, he never stopped. Indeed, he put in a lot of effort and mental energy. According to the author in the preface, the original manuscript of this book had gone through difficulties and stayed in the Japanese military police for more than a month before it was liberated with the arrival of victory. It is especially precious to see the publication of this book today.

After reading this book of nearly 300,000 words, I think there are several characteristics that are worth introducing to readers.

First, the author's writing is smooth and vivid. Although the description of the war is extremely detailed, it does not feel dull.

Second, the content is rich, and the process of the war is narrated from beginning to end, without omission, which can be used as a reference for studying international issues.

Third, when we talk about history, what we pay most attention to is the causes and consequences. The author analyzes the war situation and the successes, failures, gains, and losses of various countries in great detail with his perspective on studying international issues, which can be read as a modern history.

Fourth, in addition to the 300,000 words in the entire book, there are also more than 60 photos and illustrations, which make the content more colorful.

However, this book also has its shortcomings, which we especially want to point out, hoping that the author will revise them when it is reprinted. The first is that there are too many typos, probably due to poor proofreading. Second, the historical materials are biased towards the European part, while the Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War are only briefly described. Although the author explains his reasons in the preface, we still hope that he can accept our criticism and revise and supplement it when it is reprinted, so that it can become a complete history book.

Finally, we should cherish and reward the works that the author spent five or six years of effort and time to write, otherwise the writer's accumulation is really too bitter. In any case, this book is a masterpiece in the modern Chinese publishing world and is worth recommending to readers.

### Introducing a Concise, Simple, and Popular History of Western Philosophy

— Si Mu

Author: Li Changzhi

Publisher: Zhengzhong Bookstore

Publication Date: November 1945

I have read no less than a dozen works on the history of Western philosophy before, most of which are translations. The original material was already boring and tasteless, plus the stiff translation, and anyone who read it would feel dull. Some writings are too focused on one side and cannot integrate the entire development of the history of Western philosophical thought, making it impossible for us to peek at the trajectory of the progress of Western intellectual history. At the same time, because those books are too Confucian in style, modern people naturally do not easily feel interested in that kind of scholastic book.

I often wondered: why isn't there a History of Western Philosophy that is more clearly concise and suitable for general reading? It wasn't until now that I discovered an ideal History of Western Philosophy, that is, Li Changzhi's "History of Western Philosophy." I think this book is written very concisely, without verbose words, and can outline a profile of the history of Western philosophy with an objective attitude. After reading this book, we can get a clear concept, which guides us to further enter the hall of Western philosophical thought.

### Recent News from Western Magazines

— Shi Dong

During the war, the United States saw the emergence of many "Reader's Digest" type magazines, including Reader's Scope, Read, Fact, Digest & Review, etc. Of these, only the first one can be encountered from time to time in Shanghai's bookstores; the rest have not yet appeared in Shanghai.

A new book and newspaper called See has been released, standing in opposition to Look.

The name of the newly released popular science magazine is Science Illustrated, and it is said that the illustrations are quite appropriate.

The original version of Life newspaper states that "non-military subscribers must wait three months after receiving the order before delivery can begin." Readers who entrust bookstores in Shanghai to subscribe to the original version of the newspaper should pay attention.

According to recent letters from American book and newspaper companies, popular magazines that are selling well are still unable to be purchased in large quantities. It is unknown whether this is due to a shortage of paper or to the large-scale supply of military use.

The Saturday Evening Post Company has released a new monthly magazine called Holiday, which is said to have quite exciting content.

Most British pre-war magazines are now continuing to be published, but due to the lack of paper rationing, their length is pitifully thin. For example, Times Literary Supplement, John o' London's Weekly, and Answers are only one-third of their former length.

### Truly Giant Publication

— Zhou Fu

"Seeking Truth Magazine"

Many magazines call themselves "giant," but in reality, they only appear giant on the surface, far from being truly giant. Open books and newspapers are not truly giant. Any magazine with a sixteen-page format is not even giant in form if it only has one or two sheets of paper. Furthermore, if a magazine, whether sixteen-page or any other format, can use four or five sheets of paper, it might barely pass as giant in form, but whether its content is worthy of being called giant becomes a problem. Among the hundreds of magazines today, comparing their appearance and content, I cannot help but say that "Seeking Truth Magazine," published on May 1st, is a truly giant publication!

Of course, the content of a publication is more important than its appearance, so we might as well examine the content of "Seeking Truth" to see where its "giantness" lies.

Generally speaking, the dozens of articles inside each have their own characteristics. There will absolutely not be the current bad habits of distorting publicity, selling gimmicks, being shallow and boring, plagiarizing, wasting printing materials, and poisoning people. As examples, the following articles are particularly worth reading carefully:

### On the Epoch-Making Significance of the May Fourth Movement

Among the various articles commemorating the May Fourth Movement, this can be said to be the most detailed, most thorough, and most accurately judgmental.

### Antidote to the "Critique of Ancient History"

This is sure to have a glorious place in the history of Chinese academia or thought. It dares to challenge the powerful "Critique of Ancient History." Its courage is great, and its weapons are especially sharp.

### Lao Tzu's Philosophy and His Social Thought

It integrates the ancient with the present, and uses the present to verify the ancient, something that people with shallow knowledge cannot write.

In the inaugural speech "Founding Purpose," they put forward such a slogan: "Bravely pursue the truth! Firmly uphold the truth! But at the same time, bravely bow before the truth!" Having read its content, this slogan has indeed been put into practice.

Such a publication should, in theory, be welcomed by readers, just as readers welcomed "Eastern Miscellany" or "Shen Bao Monthly" before the war. However, with substandard publications flooding the cultural market today, one cannot help but worry whether its sales will be as ideally satisfactory. Just how far have our readers come? I think "Seeking Truth Magazine" can be used as a touchstone.

### The Story of an American Bestseller

— Jin Chun

Regarding American bestsellers, the most interesting is the book "The Robe" written by Lloyd C. Douglas. In the two years since its publication, 1,545,000 copies have already been sold. The publishing company is busy buying paper and adding printing capacity. Readers are flocking to order, and even with added printing, there is still a shortage of 30,000 to 40,000 copies.

But speaking of the bestseller itself, critics believe that it has "no literary value." Its popularity is unrivaled among American books in recent years. It ranks fifth in sales among all American bestsellers. Some Hollywood film companies are willing to offer $100,000 to purchase the film rights to "The Robe." Later, several other film companies offered $1 million to buy it, but were rejected. The film companies are confident that after "The Robe" is made into a film, it will be a sensation in the film industry and will surely make a large profit.

In terms of literary achievement, "The Robe" is a failed work compared to any world masterpiece. However, if an average of five people read each copy of "The Robe," then at least six million Americans have read the book. You may say that the vision of a few people is not good, but you cannot say that the vision of six million people is not good or that their tastes are low. Furthermore, among the readers, most say that they were moved and stimulated, and were satisfied after reading it.

Therefore, some people believe that to become a bestseller, it should have two characteristics: the moral of the book is very lofty, and the writing style is very common. A book with these two characteristics is sure to be welcomed by most people.

Reading how the author started writing "The Robe" is a very interesting story. It turns out that Douglas went to a department store one day to buy something and chatted with a female clerk. The female clerk talked about the robe that Jesus wore when he was martyred, which was taken off by the Roman guards, and everyone gambled for it by throwing dice. She asked Douglas where that robe had gone and what happened to it. Douglas certainly didn't know, but after hearing this, he suddenly remembered that this subject could be used to write a novel. So after he left, he began to write. Unexpectedly, the female clerk unintentionally provided Douglas with the material for a bestseller.

In the American book industry, the largest sales are for textbooks in schools. For example, Noah Webster's spelling reader has sold over 100 million copies in the decades since its publication, and of course, no bestselling novel can compare to it.

In the past, no novel in America sold a million copies until Harriet Beecher Stowe's "Uncle Tom's Cabin" was published in 1852, breaking the million-copy record. In the following years, no novel matched the sales of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" until 1875, when another bestselling novel appeared, Mark Twain's "Tom Sawyer," which sold 1.5 million copies and whose sales have been long-lasting and continue to this day.

It is rare for a bestseller like Mark Twain's "Tom Sawyer" to have lasting sales. Most American bestsellers only have strong sales for a few years after publication, and then quickly fade into obscurity. For example, one American bestseller with huge sales was Sheldon's "In His Steps." Today, ordinary readers have long forgotten it, and only people who study literature buy one or two copies out of curiosity. "In His Steps" was published in 1899, and the exact sales are unknown because its copyright system was not perfect. In addition to the original publishing company, a total of sixteen publishing companies later added printing, and it is estimated that the book sold at least eight million copies.

The second best-selling book is Gen Stratton Porter's "Freckles," which was published in 1904 and sold over two million copies. The third best-selling book is Lew Wallace's "Ben-Hur," published in 1880, which also sold almost two million copies. The fourth best-selling book is "A Girl of The Limberlost," also written by Porter, published in 1909, which sold a total of 1.6 million copies. The fifth best-selling book is "The Robe," mentioned above. As for the sixth best-selling books, there are two, one is Harold Bell Worth's "The Winning of Barbara Worth" (published in 1911), and the other is Margaret Mitchell's "Gone with the Wind." "The Winning of Barbara Worth" sold 1.5 million copies. "Gone with the Wind" was later adapted into a screenplay, so the exact sales are unknown, but they are roughly the same as "The Winning of Barbara Worth."

One point worth noting here is that among the six best-selling books mentioned above, three contain religious overtones. "In His Steps," "Ben-Hur," and "The Robe" all have a strong religious flavor. This does not mean that any novel, as long as it caters to the reader's psychology and adds some religious color, can successfully become a bestseller, but according to the experience of American booksellers, if a novel can adopt religious themes, it does help sales.

The special circumstances of the times also affect the sales of a book. For example, when "The Robe" was published, the American people were experiencing the outbreak of war, shattering the dream of peace. In sadness and disappointment, their souls needed comfort, and "The Robe" seized on this point, reducing the inner pain of readers, and thus gaining popular welcome. This is very similar to Pearl S. Buck's "The Good Earth." When "The Good Earth" was published, the American public was feeling bleak, hesitant, and fearful, holding an uneasy attitude towards the future, and needed encouragement and comfort. Pearl S. Buck's "The Good Earth," with the simple Chinese peasants as the theme, depicted the tenacious and enterprising spirit of Chinese peasants who, relying on diligence and frugality, ultimately did not want to leave their homeland, which excited and encouraged the American public at that time.

Speaking of the author of "The Robe," Douglas had many famous works before, and their sales were very good, but not as good as "The Robe." The first was "Magnificent Obsession," published in the spring of 1932, which was listed as one of the bestsellers of that year, and began to attract the attention of booksellers and publishers. It was reprinted fifty times and sold 700,000 copies. It sold well in the United Kingdom and Canada, and was translated into several foreign languages.

"Magnificent Obsession" was Douglas's first novel. Speaking of how the author started writing it, like "The Robe," it is also a very interesting story. Douglas wrote it for preaching purposes. Every week at worship, instead of preaching like ordinary pastors, he read a section of the novel to everyone each time. As a result, this pastor-novelist not only made the listeners interested, but also wrote this famous novel over time. Following "Forgive Us Our Trespasses," "Precious Jeopardy," "Green Light," "White Banners," "Disputed Passage," "Home for Christmas," "Dr. Hudson's Secret Journal," "Invitation to Live," and "The Robe," Douglas then wrote a novel based on the life of Peter, entitled "The Big Fisherman."

Let's see what Douglas says about his writing experience. Perhaps in this place, we can understand a little of the secret of the success of American bestsellers.

Douglas once said, "In my novels, I simply write down my thoughts, what I want to say to the audience. I assume that my audience doesn't understand Christianity at all, and I want to try to explain it to them. I use simple language, vivid stories, and metaphors to illustrate the joy of living a Christian life."

Someone said, "If Douglas's novels were written better, so many readers would not have read them; if Douglas's novels were written worse, so many readers would not have wanted to read them." These two criticisms of American bestsellers are very accurate.
