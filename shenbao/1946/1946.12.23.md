### Second Reading of Constitution Draft More Than Halfway Through, Articles 54 to 82 Mostly Discussed and Passed

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The 15th National Assembly was held at 3:40 PM on the 22nd. At the opening of the meeting, 1,352 representatives were present, later increasing to 1,400. Chaired by Bai Chongxi, the reporter read the minutes of the 14th meeting. Starting from Article 54 of Chapter 5, "Administration," the second reading procedure continued, discussing the amendments to the Constitution and the amendments proposed by the representatives in accordance with Article 24 of the Rules of Procedure. Passed without objection. For Article "56," Representative Zhao Zimao and 35 others proposed an amendment to limit the term of Acting President Liu of the Executive Yuan to three months, in order to prevent the Legislative Yuan's right of consent from becoming void and the danger of "second-rate figures" presiding over important administrative duties for a long time. However, after discussion and voting, it was rejected and the original text was passed. Articles "57" and "58" were passed without objection. Regarding Article "59," Representative Ju Zheng spoke, arguing that the original Constitution draft should not delete the point that the Executive Yuan submits amnesty cases to the Legislative Yuan. He said: "Since the eight years of the War of Resistance, there have been many legal restrictions, and political recovery has not yet been on the right track. There are many people who have committed crimes, and prisons everywhere are overcrowded. The Judicial Yuan has requested the issuance of an amnesty decree, but due to legislative procedures, it has not yet been completed, and there is no way to resolve it. Everyone should pay attention to this difficult fact in the judicial field and understand the people, and reserve this power for the government." After Ju's speech, Chairman Bai declared: The Presidium will temporarily reserve its opinion on this issue. The representatives then questioned how great the power of the Presidium was? Then Representative Pan Gongzhan spoke in the chaos, believing that this was not a question of reservation, but a question of whether to submit a reconsideration motion. Chairman Bai replied: If you want to reconsider and change the review report, please formally submit it in accordance with the rules of procedure. The original text was still passed by vote. Articles 60 and 61 were passed without objection. In Chapter 6, "Legislation," Articles 62 and 63 were passed without objection. In Article 64, "The Legislative Yuan may accept petitions from the people," Representative Chen Guyuan and 35 others proposed an amendment, arguing that the people's right to petition was already broadly stipulated in Article 17. If special provisions are made for the Legislative Yuan, it would be restrictive, and the provision "may accept" is unreasonable and should be deleted. The result of the vote was passed by an absolute majority of 1,069 votes, and the article was deleted. In Article 65, regarding the provisions for the number of Legislative Yuan members produced in the first electoral districts, there were two amendments: one was proposed by Representative Fu Sinian and 45 others, stating that in order to take into account that the number of Legislative Yuan members was too large and it was easy to cause difficulties, it was requested to change the number to five for those with a population of less than five million (originally three million), and for provinces with more than five million, add one member for every two million (originally one million). The other was proposed by Representative Zhao Pei and 36 others, in order to avoid the malpractice of Legislative Yuan members from a few provinces with large populations manipulating the meeting, it was requested to change the Legislative Yuan members elected according to the population ratio to one member for every three million (originally one million). After Zhao and Fu explained the reasons, Liu Zhendong and others successively stated their opposition. Pu Ru also stood up several times in the upper seating area, but did not get a chance to speak. The atmosphere at the meeting became tense. Chairman Bai responded to the requests of some attendees and submitted the matter to a vote. As a result, Fu's amendment received 565 votes, and Zhao's amendment received 326 votes, both of which were rejected, and the article remained as originally drafted. Articles 66 to 72 and other six articles (the original Article 68 was deleted) were passed without objection. Regarding Article 73, Representative Shi Shangkuan and 34 others proposed an amendment, believing that in addition to the Executive Yuan, the Examination Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, and the Control Yuan should be allowed to attend meetings of the Legislative Yuan regarding legal cases under their jurisdiction. After voting, it was passed by a majority of 947 votes, and the article was amended to: "When the Legislative Yuan is in session, the heads of the (original: Executive) Yuan and various ministries related to (original: administration) may attend to state their opinions." Articles 74 to 78 and other five articles were passed without objection. At 5:00 PM, there was a 20-minute break, and then the meeting continued. Regarding Article 79, Representative Ni Bi and 34 others and Representative Zhang Mian and 31 others proposed two amendments, both intending to amend it to: "Legislative Yuan members shall not be arrested or detained without the permission of the Legislative Yuan, except for current offenders (adding six words below) and those who have been prosecuted." After discussion and voting, it was rejected, and the original text was maintained by an absolute majority of 1,058 votes. Regarding Article 80, Representative Zhang Zhongdao and 35 others proposed an amendment, intending to amend it to "Legislative Yuan members (adding four words below) shall not concurrently hold (adding three words below) or transfer to official positions during their term of office." After Zhang explained the case, it was supported by the attendees, but after voting, it received 602 votes and was still rejected by a minority. Article 81 was passed without objection. In Chapter 7, "Judiciary," Article 82, regarding the issue of disciplinary power over civil servants, caused debate. Representative Gu Fengxiang and 58 others proposed amendments to this article and Article 95, arguing that this power belongs to the Control Yuan. Representative Zhang Shiwu and others agreed, believing that the power of the Control Yuan in the current Constitution draft is too small and should be supplemented with disciplinary power in order to achieve a balance of five powers. Then Wei Tingsheng spoke in a hoarse voice to oppose it. After voting, the amendment only received 341 votes, and the original text was passed by a large majority of 1,058 votes. At this point, at 6:00 PM, the discussion was stopped, and Secretary-General Hong reported that a general meeting would be held on the 23rd in the morning and afternoon. The Presidium gathered to discuss after the meeting, and then the meeting was adjourned.

### Tens of Thousands of Communist Troops Fleeing to Northern Jiangsu, Liaocheng in Shandong Bombarded by Artillery, Situation Critical

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 22nd] It is widely rumored here that the Communist army will launch a new offensive in the near future to besiege Jinan. According to a certain military observer: Jinan is the heart of Shandong, and the Jiaoji Railway is the only major artery traversing east and west Shandong. In terms of strategy, capturing Jinan would be heard at home and abroad, demonstrating the strength and determination of the Communist Party. A certain third party continues to wave the flag and shout for the Communist Party. In terms of tactics, capturing Jinan would lead to the collapse of the Jiaoji Railway, and the entire Shandong would fall into its hands. If Shandong cannot be defended, the Communist army could go north to Beiping and Tianjin, forming a confrontation with the National Army, or go south to Jiangnan, forming a sweeping trend. The Communist army in Ji and Yu are moving towards northern and western Shandong. Liu Bocheng has entered Dezhou. The main force of the Communist army in northern Jiangsu and Chen Yi's troops are fleeing back to southern Shandong. The Communist army is actively conscripting soldiers in the liberated areas of Shandong. All men aged 15 to 50 and women aged 16 to 40 are forcibly enlisted, indicating that their intentions are not small. However, this is just the Communist army's wishful thinking. Under the leadership of Commander Wang, Jinan has already overcome the most difficult 16 months in the past. Now it has sufficient strength, the people are stable, and military and political orders have been unified. It is only limited by the government's repeated tolerance (ceasefire order) constraints, and it is impossible to take the initiative militarily. If the Communist army overestimates its capabilities, it will only see its own destruction.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 22nd] Zaohe (eight miles south of Yaowan) in Pi County was captured by the Communist army on the morning of the 22nd. In addition, more than 50,000 Communist troops recently fled from southern Shandong to northern Jiangsu, with many Japanese mixed in.

[Our Qianjiang Dispatch, 22nd] It is reported that: (1) On the morning of the 22nd, more than 20,000 Communist troops from Shentangzao attacked Xinxingchang from the south.

### Vietnamese Separatists Plan to Form "National Front Government"

U.S. Denies Claim that Vietnam Requested Intervention in Franco-Vietnamese Conflict

[Agencia France-Presse, Nanjing, 22nd] Mo Yingdongdan, the leader of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party and former foreign minister of the Viet Minh Republican National Government, is currently in Nanjing, residing with several other Nationalist Party leaders in a small Chinese-style hotel across from the Foreign Ministry building. Mr. Ge told this agency's reporter today that the Vietnamese "National Front Government" has been formed and will be announced at an appropriate time. Mr. Ge declined to disclose the location of the new government, but it is likely to be in China, possibly in Nanjing. Mr. Ge is likely to serve as prime minister or foreign minister, or both. The four major policies of the new government are as follows:

(1) The United States and China should mediate to begin negotiations with France and guarantee that any agreement that may be reached in the future will be implemented immediately.

(2) The Viet Minh must become a truly free state within the institutions of the Vietnam Federation and the French Federation, and must have the right to send diplomatic representatives. Its territory must extend south to the 16th parallel north latitude, i.e., in addition to Tonkin, it should also include central Annam and Cochinchina. (According to its provisions, only Laos and Cambodia would remain as territories of the Vietnam Federation outside the Viet Minh Republic.)

(3) The Viet Minh must have an appropriate proportion of representatives in the Vietnam Federation Council. The chairman of the council will be French, but his power should be purely representative, like a British Commissioner in Australia.

(4) French troops may occupy certain specific locations within the territory of the Viet Minh, which will be determined by mutual agreement, and French troops must withdraw from those locations within five years. All French economic and cultural interests in the Viet Minh territory will be faithfully guaranteed by the Viet Minh government.

Mr. Ge and his colleagues withdrew from Ho Chi Minh's coalition government because they were unwilling to participate in the Franco-Vietnamese negotiations. Mr. Wan accused Ho Chi Minh, saying that the Franco-Vietnamese negotiations in Fontainebleau, France, in September of this year broke down, and the Vietnamese representatives were first sent back to the country, but Ho Chi Minh signed a provisional agreement with the French side alone, losing credibility with the people. Furthermore, Ho Chi Minh is not trusted by the people because of his close ties to the Communist Party. The order to dissolve the Communist Party in January of this year was merely a formality, and Ho Chi Minh still takes orders from Moscow. The Ho Chi Minh government will resign sooner or later and be replaced by the newly organized "National Government" to find ways to contact Nanjing and Washington to request mediation.

[Agencia France-Presse, Washington, 21st] The State Department has denied reports that representatives of the Viet Minh government in Vietnam have requested the U.S. government to intervene in the Franco-Vietnamese conflict.

### Qian Changzhao Reports to the Provincial Assembly: Prospects for Ten Enterprises in Taiwan; Pre-war Production Levels Will Definitely Be Restored in Three Years

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 22nd] Qian Changzhao, Chairman of the Resources Committee, gave a detailed report to the Joint Provincial Assembly on the ten enterprises operated independently or jointly by the Committee in Taiwan on the 21st. He first clarified that state-owned enterprises and private enterprises should complement each other and that there is no conflict between the two. He emphasized that the economic construction of Taiwan must be able to coordinate with the whole country. He then described the prospects for the ten enterprises as follows:

(1) Petroleum: The repair work has reached 90%, and 16,000 barrels of crude oil can be refined daily by January next year.

(2) Lead Industry: The damage is severe, and the repairs are difficult. However, the first phase of work will be completed in October next year, with an annual output of 8,000 tons of lead ingots. After the second phase of work, the annual output of 24,000 tons will be completed by the end of the year.

(3) Gold and Copper: The goal of the first phase is to produce 300 tons of gold ore and 45 tons of sediment daily, which is expected to be completed within four months. Cooperation with Canada is currently being discussed for the aluminum and copper industries to leverage their capital and technology.

(4) Electricity: When received, the power generation capacity was 42,000 kilowatts. It has now reached 183,000 kilowatts. The goal of 200,000 kilowatts can be reached by February next year. If the plan for the 36th year of the Republic of China can be completed as scheduled, it will increase by 300,000 kilowatts.

(5) Sugar Industry: There was no production when it was received. When I came to Taiwan last time, 86,000 tons of sugar had been produced from existing sugarcane. Repairs are now being stepped up, and sugarcane is being actively planted. 100,000 tons of sugar can be produced in the 36th year of the Republic of China. The output will gradually increase to 1 million tons in three years.

(6) Fertilizer: When I came to Taiwan last time, major products such as phosphate fertilizer and nitrogen fertilizer were not produced. Now phosphate fertilizer can reach an annual output of 25,000 tons, and nitrogen fertilizer can reach an annual salt content of 9,600 tons. It is predicted that the former will reach 42,000 tons and the latter will produce 12,000 tons by next year. Recently, with the assistance of the Executive Yuan, it is hoped that the output can reach more than 200,000 tons in the year after next.

(7) Alkali Production: The main products are caustic soda, soda powder, and hydrochloric acid, and production is also increasing. In the future, it is planned to use Japanese reparations equipment to actively expand production.

(8) Cement: The Kaohsiung plant currently produces 11,000 tons per month, and the Su'ao plant produces 4,000 tons, for a total monthly output of 16,000 tons. It is now planned to purchase more machines, supplement equipment, and build a light railway at the Zhudong plant to complete the goal of an annual output of 4.2 million barrels.

(9) Paper Mills: There was no production at all factories when they were received. Production was still low when I came to Taiwan last time. Now it is gradually increasing. It is estimated that by next year, the total daily output of all factories will be 42 tons of paper and 35 tons of pulp.

(10) Machinery and Shipbuilding: There are the Long and Kaohsiung plants. When I came to Taiwan last time, only sugar-making machinery was produced. Now the output of sugar-making machinery has gradually increased, and the production of other heavy oil engines and wooden ships is also being stepped up. However, the equipment is poor. In the future, it is planned to use Japanese reparations equipment to enable large-scale ship repairs and build ships of 3,000 to 4,000 tons.

Mr. Qian also said that the original capital invested by the people of Taiwan Province in various enterprises will be recognized if it complies with national laws and regulations. The participation of private capital is also welcome in some enterprises without private shares. Finally, he affirmed to the Taiwan Provincial Assembly that the restoration plan of the above-mentioned enterprises will take two years for some and three years for others. I believe that in three years, the production level of the Japanese before the war will definitely be restored. Some enterprises, such as petroleum, aluminum, fertilizer, and shipbuilding, will definitely exceed it. The future economic construction of Taiwan will definitely be more scaled than in the Japanese era.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 22nd] Qian Changzhao, accompanied by business committee members Sun Zheng, Hong Zhong, Zhang Jun, and Lu Yuwen, flew to Guangzhou by special plane at 11:00 a.m. today. Mr. Qian is scheduled to fly from Guangdong to Hainan Island on the 24th, return to Guangdong on the 27th, and fly back to Nanjing on the 28th.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd] Qian Changzhao and others flew from Taiwan to Guangdong on the afternoon of the 22nd.

### Longhai Railway to Add a Direct Train from Xuzhou to Baoji Starting Next Month; Freight Transport to Be Restored First on the Shitian Line

[This Newspaper, Xi'an, 21st] Longhai Railway Bureau News: The Zhongmu Bridge is afraid that ice floes will impact the new bridge, so it has not dared to test the operation of large locomotives towing long-distance trains.

Starting in February, four additional round-trip trains will be added from Xuzhou to Zhengzhou. The engineering train for the Shitian Line has been opened. Freight transport will be restored first on the entire line next month, and passenger tickets will not be sold for the time being.

### The Enemy Puppets Had a Secret Prison in Lv Yuan, Changchun; War Criminal Fujita Confesses

[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 22nd] War criminal Fujita Kanichi was originally the intelligence chief of Doihara. The Changchun War Criminals Investigation Committee confessed during the interrogation of the prisoner yesterday afternoon that there was a secret prison 20 miles outside the suburbs of Changchun. The building is a steel-reinforced concrete structure, with brick walls about ten feet high on all sides. There are 25 single rooms and an ancient well. In the past, young "ideological prisoners" were executed with extreme punishment. Although it is now desolate, it is still filled with murderous intent. [Central News Agency, Changchun, 22nd] The Changchun War Criminal Investigation Committee interrogated Fujita Kanichi, a Japanese war criminal who served as an intelligence officer under Doihara and was entrusted by the Puppet Manchukuo Medical Affairs Bureau, yesterday morning. The prisoner confessed to the horrifying secret prison and chemical research institute of Changchun during the Puppet Manchukuo era. The site is near Luyuan, surrounded by open space. The War Criminal Investigation Committee immediately sent personnel to Luyuan with the prisoner for verification. The results confirmed that the place was indeed the secret interrogation prison that was generally known by name but not by location. It is said that during the Puppet Manchukuo era, the houses of the secret prison and chemical research institute were surrounded by a ten-foot-high charcoal-colored brick wall. Trees were planted around the wall. The courtyard was about 100 meters in diameter. When the communist army entered Changchun, the surrounding walls and trees were all destroyed. Only the windows and doors of the prison and chemical research institute houses remain. Inside, there are single cells and guard rooms. There are a total of twenty-five single cells. The single cells are still largely intact, but the rooms are filled with a gloomy atmosphere. It is unknown how many patriots starved to death in them at that time. The chemical research institute has a total of four houses, upstairs and downstairs. The internal facilities are divided into electrified chemical interrogation rooms, etc. Broken electric meters and wires still remain in the electrical research room. There are two laboratory benches and two electric wires in the chemical research room, and traces of various chemicals are everywhere. The internal equipment of the interrogation room has been completely destroyed.

### Statistical Society Holds Annual Meeting; President Issues Instructions to Encourage Continuous Improvement

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The 13th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Statistical Society was held at Huiling Middle School on the 22nd. More than 100 people attended, including Zheng Yan'an, Zhu Junyi, Chu Yifei, and Shou Miancheng. The President of the Village Research Association delivered a speech at the meeting and respectfully read Chairman Chiang's instructions. Then, Director of Budget, Accounting, and Statistics Xu Kan gave a speech, stating: "All national administrations need statistical data as a basis. The Budget, Accounting, and Statistics Office also needs reasonable and accurate statistical data for reference when preparing budgets." He also proposed three points for the connection between the Statistics Office and the Statistical Society. At 11:00 a.m., papers were read, including Zhu Junyi's "Discussion on the Naming of Large Numbers in China" and Zheng Yao's "Preliminary Discussion on Improving Tax Revenue through Statistical Survey Methods in France," and more than ten other papers. After taking a group photo and having lunch at 12:30 p.m., the reading of papers continued. From 2:00 p.m., there were reports on society affairs, discussions of proposals, and elections of directors and supervisors. The meeting ended at 6:00 p.m. The full text of Chairman Chiang's instructions is as follows:

In February of the 30th year of the Republic of China, the Budget, Accounting, and Statistics Office of the National Government held its first plenary meeting, and I once said in my speech: "The three important classifications of budget, accounting, and statistics business are budget, accounting, and statistics. Budget is related to assessment, accounting complements execution, and statistics is the basis for design. This is closely related to the three procedures of design, execution, and assessment in administration." I also said: "Statistical business is the source of information for determining plans for political construction and economic construction. It should be accelerated and its content should be improved." From this significance, we can know the importance of statistics to national construction. However, appointment depends on talent, and talent originates from knowledge. Today, you gentlemen are gathered together as a society for statistical science. You should conduct thorough research on statistical theories and statistical problems. Generally speaking, it is easy to compile statistical matters clearly, but it is difficult to be accurate and precise. It is easy to do it in the central government, but it is difficult to do it locally. If you want to seek self-division and combine the net, you can only achieve this if those in charge are single-minded and technically excellent, so that the statistics of our country will be improved to meet the needs. This is the basis for all great national plans, and I have great hopes for you.

### Removal of Industrial Equipment in Northeast China Deepens Discord Between the United States and the Soviet Union; U.S. Newspaper Comments on Pauley's Investigation Report

[Central News Agency, New York, 21st] The Times of Maine commented on Pauley's final report on the Northeast, stating that the removal of factories in Northeast China has further deepened the discord between the United States and the Soviet Union on such policy issues. The Soviet Union clearly stated that such industrial equipment belonged to Japan, and therefore was part of the spoils of war. If this view is based on an ambiguous interpretation of the various agreements we have made, it is sufficient to prove the lack of appropriate contact between the military leaders or diplomatic representatives of the two countries. The newspaper continued: "The past may not be pursued." But this kind of mutual demand and policy conflict will never end. If we want it to end, we must try our best to reach a comprehensive understanding with the Soviet Union on the Far East issue. The Soviet Union will eventually realize that it faces the same or even greater dangers in China and the Northwest Pacific as we do.

### Question of Changing Hankou to a Municipality Directly Under the Central Government

Representatives to the National Assembly from Hubei and the Mayor Vigorously Strive for It in Letters to Chairman Chiang and President Song

[This Newspaper, Hankou, 22nd] The issue of changing Hankou into a municipality directly under the central government is becoming more and more intense. In recent days, city councilors have had heated discussions. The council has also received a telegram from Speaker Zhang Guangrun from Beijing stating that this matter has been jointly filed by all National Assembly representatives from Hubei together with Mayor Xu to Chairman Chiang and President Song, and the central government is paying close attention to it and is expected to restore the status of a municipality directly under the central government. According to all parties, there is no objection to this telegram, but the general sentiment is quite cold due to the low municipal efficiency in the previous month.

The ship is scheduled to sail from Hong Kong to Taiwan on the 26th, carrying camphor, tea, and coal to Hong Kong for sale.

### The Ninth Branch of the Military Academy in Dihua Changed to an Officer Training Class

Except for the students who are about to graduate, all the recruits of all ethnic groups recruited this summer have been transferred to the Chengdu Main Campus for training. The recruits originally numbered more than 400, but now there are only more than 120 left, mostly Uyghur youths. According to the recruits, the chief class director, Colonel Wang Mingshi, said that the students were recruited from Southern Xinjiang and have a strong sense of national identity. They were overjoyed to hear that they were going to Sichuan for protection. The Colonel spoke precisely, and they congratulated each other. They were to be led to Chengdu by Mr. Zai on December 25th.

When the puppet provincial government was established, he served as the puppet governor.

### Editorial: Tax Reduction Movement

City councilors Chen Weijian and others have proposed reducing taxes and fees to alleviate the burden on the people, which is a matter worthy of public attention. At a time when the treasury is empty and resources are exhausted, hoping for immediate results is, frankly, easier said than done. However, the problem is indeed very serious. As the original proposal states, "Not only will social order be disrupted, but it will also affect national chaos," which is not an exaggeration. Here, let's briefly list a few of the current unreasonable tax collection practices to arouse public attention.

(1) Too Heavy: In ancient times, the "one-tenth" tax was levied, and when it reached two-tenths, it was already felt that the people's strength could not bear it. Now, however, under the names of luxury, consumption, entertainment, etc., it is often levied at 40%, 50%, or even 100% for every 100, or 200% for every 100. In addition to taking all the profits, half of it is added to the levy. Speaking of the principles of taxation, what principles can be discussed here? It is nothing more than drinking poison to quench thirst, killing the chicken to get the eggs, just to meet the urgent needs. But "if the people are not sufficient, with whom shall you be sufficient?" When the source of tax revenue reaches the point of exhaustion, many unemployed people in society are added to the ranks of those in need of relief, and countless unscrupulous elements are added to the prisons who take risks. The state only adds to the burden. In the end, who gains and who loses? Just look a little further and everyone can see it.

(2) Too Complicated: Recently, when the Hubei Provincial Assembly convened, a certain councilor stated that merchants in Hankou had to pay more than 30 kinds of taxes and fees every month, almost having to pay a tax or fee every day. This is a practical proof of the current excessive complexity of taxes and fees. In fact, inventing excuses and levying taxes arbitrarily is not limited to Hankou alone, it's just that no one has statistically accounted for it elsewhere.

(3) Too Hypocritical: There are many methods of collecting money that superficially always use some high-sounding reasons as a guise, thus creating many forms and procedures. For example, registration, certification, stamping, licensing, inspection, etc. In addition to the certificate, a guarantee is also required; and the paper costs money, the registration costs money, and the license costs money. It goes without saying that a license costs money, but even copying, inspecting, reporting loss, reissuing, etc., all cost money, which seems a little unreasonable. We do not deny that there are several of these that seem necessary in law. But there are many others that have no other effect than to increase government revenue. If it is only for the purpose of investigation and statistics, then there is no need to spend so much effort. If it is to protect certain rights and interests, and it is said that it must go through such procedures to be legally protected, then it seems questionable whether legal protection must go through such procedures. In other words, without these procedures, the law may not completely reject it. As far as we can see, it is rare for these registrations, certifications, inspections... etc. to be fully completed on time. Our view is that if it is for the sake of income, then the procedures can be omitted and taxes can be collected directly and happily in accordance with the regulations. The public can gain real benefits, and the people can avoid being disturbed.

(4) Too Unreasonable: This includes too many organizing agencies and too many officials, so that most of the income is completely used for collection fees, so that the public does not get real benefits. Moreover, there are many tax items that are too fragmented, and although the effort is diligent, the effect is minimal. As for stacking beds on top of houses, double taxation on one item, tax A is not finished, tax B is coming again, taxing the present and also tracing back to the past, etc., we believe that are all unreasonable.

(5) Too Clumsy: Some people think that Chinese officials are best at extortion, but this is only one side of the story. In the past, there were some taxes and fees that could only be contracted out to merchants or recognized by various industries because the official management was too poor, which shows that their collection techniques were not very clever. Although this situation has gradually decreased now, the regulations are too complicated, and there are too many procedures. Many new tax rules are too cumbersome, so that taxpayers have nowhere to go but to consult specialists such as accountants to handle them on their behalf. Even the collection personnel feel that the content is too complicated, and if they were to follow it closely and handle it one by one, it would inevitably be a waste of money and time. Therefore, under the slogan of sympathizing with the difficulties of merchants, many simplified and flexible methods of tax collection have emerged. It is said that some of them are quite close to contracting out. This method can save taxpayers some trouble, and we do not want to criticize it too much. What is strange is that since simplification is known, why is the legislation so strict? Since the legislation is so strict, how can it be simplified? This is really a difficult problem to solve.

In view of this, the proposal to reduce taxes and fees submitted by Councilor Chen and others is quite complex and should not only be satisfied with reducing the number of tax items. All tax rates, tax rules, and even tax systems should be investigated clearly and the government should be asked to make reasonable adjustments.

Secondly, there are a few points that are directly related to this case and are also worth mentioning. First, new taxes and fees should not be created rashly. In particular, they should not be created freely by administrative agencies. Now that people's opinion organs have been established everywhere, they must be submitted to the relevant people's opinion organs for formal approval before they can be announced in accordance with the law. Because various taxes and fees often have a very appealing reason at the beginning of their announcement and implementation, and it is said that this is a temporary nature and will be cancelled once the deadline expires, but in fact it is very easy to promulgate and very difficult to cancel. For example, the banquet tax and hotel tax, which are now the main sources of income for this city, were originally a kind of voluntary donation for relieving refugees. Who knew that after the situation changed, they would become a reliable source of regular income for the local area. Whether the so-called municipal construction donation can be terminated on schedule is now another question. Therefore, creating new taxes and fees is indeed a very serious issue and should not be taken lightly. Second, any tax or fee should not be labeled with the name of its purpose. For example, construction donation, health donation, education donation, etc. Because the principle of finance is to emphasize unified collection and expenditure, the original budget may already include such expenses. If it is indeed insufficient, it can be considered and made up for by giving priority to the most urgent matters, so why bother using these good-sounding names to teach those who hold dissenting opinions to risk being accused of sabotage and destruction. Third, the agencies that use the funds should not collect and spend the money directly. The abuse of this matter is the greatest, and the embezzlement is the most. In today's era of independent accounting and independent auditing, it seems that there is very little possibility. But in fact, it can be seen everywhere.

To rectify officialdom and reduce the suffering of the people, nothing is more important than rectifying finance. To rectify finance, of course, we should start with improving the private system and eliminating unreasonable tax rates and tax items. Therefore, we express our warm sympathy for the proposal of Councilor Chen and others.

### An Interlude in the Hankou Municipal Reorganization Issue: A Dispute Between the City Council and the Provincial Government

[Our Newspaper Hankou News] The Hankou Municipal Reorganization issue has caused a pointless dispute between the City Council and the Provincial Government, with both sides going from verbal arguments to written battles. The reason is that on the opening day of the Hankou City Council (16th), Councilor Hu Wenhui criticized the Provincial Government for opposing the issue of Hankou Municipality being reorganized into a Directly Controlled Municipality in his reply, and accused Chairman Wan of making arbitrary decisions. Yu Zhengdong, the director of the department representing Chairman Wan who was present at the time, did not make any statement. Afterwards, because reporters interviewed him, he said that the councilor's attitude was inappropriate, which aroused the anger of all the councilors, who jointly sent a letter to Director Yu, requesting an explanation of the "inappropriate" words. The spokesperson of the Provincial Government also issued a written statement, saying: The issue of Hankou City being reorganized into a Directly Controlled Municipality should be decided by the Central Government. The City Council can make suggestions to the government at the same level in accordance with its organizational regulations, and forward them to the Central Government for approval. The Provincial Government can also submit its opinions to the Central Government for reference. At the opening of the Hankou City Council, Councilor Hu actually used a "harsh tone" and a "furious" attitude in his reply, and said in a scolding tone that the Provincial Government's "views were confused" and "asked" Chairman Wan to "put more effort into studying Hubei's politics, economy, culture, and transportation, and make fewer unnecessary claims." It can be seen that this is purely a matter of loyalty. As for the City Council's letter to Director Yu, who represents the Chairman of the Provincial Government, requesting an explanation of the word "inappropriate," the City Council has no right to question the Provincial Government according to law, and its writing procedures are not in accordance with the regulations of the Executive Yuan's Dian (電) No. 1, Yang (養) Wu (午) 34th year, so there is no need to reply. This can also be said to be a small wave in the voice of democracy.

### Anhui Provincial Councilors Question Provincial Affairs, Request Severe Punishment for Three County Magistrates Who Sabotaged People's Opinion Organs, No This Year's Land Tax Will Be Levied in Seven Counties in Northeastern Anhui

[Our Newspaper Hefei 22nd News] The 21st was the second day of the second session of the Anhui Provincial Council. At 9:00 a.m., Secretary-General Su of the Provincial Government attended and reported on the Provincial Government's policy contents, focusing on the policy plan for next year, a total of 60 items. After the report, the inquiry began, and the councilors spoke enthusiastically. Fan Peike fired the first shot, saying that a large number of students were recruited and trained by various cadre training groups. This is military shareholding. After the election in the future, how will these cadre training students find a way out? Is this misleading Anhui children? In addition, there are as many as 160 inspectors from various departments of the Provincial Government. Their task is equivalent to "Gentlemen (reporting good things to heaven and ensuring peace in the lower world)," what is the use of this? As for clarifying officialdom, it is hoped that the Provincial Government will make a big move next year, and only ask whether the Provincial Government has the determination. Ding Jixian said that many county magistrates who stepped down often came to the province to "become inspectors." Some of them have not cleared their accounts and are still swaying in various counties. Are these county magistrates who have not cleared their accounts becoming inspectors, is the Provincial Government protecting them? It is hoped that these inspectors will be immediately dismissed. Chen Tianren asked that the disaster situation in northeastern Anhui is unprecedented in the past 60 years, and spring cultivation next spring is the most serious problem. Why does the Provincial Government not include it in next year's central work? Tong Chunxuan said that the census is not accurate at all. There are many people who report more and less. The census takers have money to spend, so they don't care. Therefore, there is a news headline: "The census takes three months, drinking, playing cards, and making money." Please ask the Provincial Government to conduct a thorough investigation and improvement. He Zhao, Sun Yuhang, Chu Zuoshi, Yin Yingji, Wu Detang, etc. all made suggestions on the current unreasonable situation in various counties. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon.

He asked why he did not list the health medicines and equipment in the report, where did those things go? The Provincial Keqing Hospital killed a patient with an injection, what kind of hospital is this?

### British Ultimatum Expires Tonight, Albania Submits Reply, Yugoslavia Denies Supplying Mines to Albania

[Our Dispatch] London, 22nd Broadcast: The British Foreign Office has announced that regarding the October 22nd mine explosion off the Albanian coast that damaged two British destroyers, the British government sent a note to Albania requesting an explanation. The Albanian Chargé d'Affaires delivered Albania's reply to the British Ambassador to Albania, Baker, on Saturday night. The British note set a deadline for Albania to respond by Monday night, stating that if the response was not deemed satisfactory, Britain would submit the case to the United Nations Security Council.

[Central News Agency, London, 21st, United Press] According to semi-official Yugoslav sources, the rumor that Yugoslavia supplied mines to Albania is purely unfounded, as Albania does not need to obtain mines from Yugoslavia. Due to the war, the Albanian coast was mined by the German navy. Therefore, if they need mines, they can easily obtain them from their own coast.

### US and Soviet Occupation Authorities in Germany to Discuss German Economic Unification, Clark Appointed US Representative to Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 21st] General McNarney, Commander-in-Chief of the US Occupation Forces in Germany, stated that the US Occupation Authorities would hold talks with the Soviet Occupation Authorities to discuss the economic unification of Germany, but no decision is likely to be reached before the next meeting of the four Foreign Ministers in Moscow.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 21st, United Press] Murphy, Political Advisor to the US Occupation Government in Germany, who will represent Byrnes at the London Preparatory Meeting of Foreign Ministers on January 15th, told reporters today that his main hope is that the allied nations will maintain their victorious achievements when discussing the German issue thoroughly.

Murphy added, "We must not underestimate the scope of the task ahead. Whether in London or Moscow, there will be many difficult tasks ahead."

### Poland Replies to British Note, Accuses Britain of Breaking Promises, Friction Between the Two Countries Not Easily Resolved

[Agence France-Presse, Warsaw, 22nd] The British government sent a note to the Polish government on November 22nd, requesting assurances of free elections on January 19th of next year. Today, the Polish Acting Foreign Minister delivered a reply to the British Ambassador to Poland, Bevin, accusing Britain of violating its obligations to Poland. The British note expressed concern about whether Poland would respect the Yalta and Potsdam agreements when holding future elections. The Polish reply stated that the guarantee of free elections was not only mentioned in the Yalta and Potsdam agreements but also clearly stipulated in the Polish constitution. The reply also expressed regret that Britain had failed to fulfill its promises to Poland in several areas, and particularly emphasized the following two points: (1) After the dissolution of the Polish government-in-exile in London, the British government still allowed Polish exiles to conduct guerrilla activities and retain their representatives abroad. (2) The Polish Rehabilitation Work Group was established in Britain and was beyond the authority of the Polish government. Britain still retains a certain amount of Polish gold, which, if returned, would accelerate Poland's reconstruction. Furthermore, the Polish ships seized by the British government have not yet been returned to their original owners. The Polish government hopes that the British government will further adhere to its promises.

Britain Further Clarifies Its Position

[Reuters, London, 21st] It is now known that the exchange of notes between Britain and Poland has failed to ensure that Warsaw will hold elections on the terms desired by Britain. Regarding Poland's accusations against the British government, the British government has issued the following clarification: (1) The former Polish government in London did not receive financial assistance from Britain. Its personnel enjoyed the same freedoms of speech and association as other residents in Britain. (2) The British government has promised not to force Polish soldiers who do not wish to return home to do so. Many Allied soldiers stationed abroad also do not wish to return home. (3) Regarding the formation of labor service teams, this is a matter of training militia under British law. (4) Britain and Poland reached an agreement this summer to resolve Poland's war debt. The British government's failure to ratify the agreement and its retention of Polish gold and funds in Britain are solely due to Poland's unwillingness to fulfill its promise to hold fair and free elections. The delay in sending Polish soldiers back home is due to the Polish government's inability to provide detailed records of each soldier.

### Britain to Recall Ambassador to Spain in Accordance with UN Resolution, Spanish Government to Also Recall Envoy

[Reuters, London, 21st] The British government has instructed Sir Mallet, the British Ambassador to Spain, to return home as soon as he has concluded his personal affairs.

[Agence France-Presse, Madrid, 22nd] Regarding rumors that Franco's Spain and Arab countries have reached an agreement to grant autonomy to Spanish Morocco, Spanish officials said today that they know nothing about it. However, neutral observers say that Franco may have made some promises to Moroccans residing in the Spanish zone in order to persuade Arab countries to adopt a neutral stance when the United Nations General Assembly votes on the Spanish issue. However, it is recognized that the time is not yet ripe to reach a conclusion. It is reported that Varela, the Spanish High Commissioner in Morocco, recently allowed three Moroccan intellectuals to go to Cairo for preliminary cultural contact with the Arab League. This gesture aims to express Franco's goodwill, as he believes that the activities of these three representatives will be limited to cultural aspects and will not involve politics. However, sources in Madrid with inside knowledge say that the activities of these three representatives have exceeded the scope of their instructions, putting the Spanish government in an awkward position. At the same time, Spanish republican exiles, with the support of the Moroccan national movement, held a meeting to guarantee that once Spain restores the republic, it will immediately grant autonomy to Spanish Morocco. Therefore, various rumors are even more confusing.

### Hitler's Nemesis, Anhart, Comes Out of Retirement

### France Plans to Reduce Army Size, Current Strength 650,000 Men

[United Press, Paris, 21st] Although France prides itself on being one of the Big Four, under Prime Minister Blum's economic plan, its military strength may be reduced to that of a second or third-rate country. The Maginot and Siegfried Lines are a thing of the past, and the German coastal defenses from Oslo to Bordeaux have been completely destroyed. France's military strength of 650,000 men, including gendarmes, marines, and the air force, is second only to Yugoslavia in continental Europe, after the Soviet Union. According to reliable intelligence estimates, Yugoslavia is the strongest of the small countries in Europe today, with a military strength of 800,000 men. The current French economic plan advocates reducing the military. An army of 300,000 men would be roughly equivalent to Franco's Spanish army or to the force that Czechoslovakia or the Netherlands could muster. Blum's attempt to form a coalition government last week failed due to military issues. The French Communist and Popular Republican parties could not agree on who should be Minister of Defense. The Communist Party refused to join Blum's cabinet without a seat in the Ministry of Defense, while the Popular Republican Party refused to consider it, claiming that the Communist Party would use a fifth column to undermine the French army. Therefore, Blum had to form a purely Socialist cabinet with a minority party, promising to save the economy by reducing public servants and the military.

### Supreme Soviet Passes New Budget

What constitutes "special income" is not specified.

### Madame Pandit Delivers Speech, Praises China's Stance, Says UN Work Quite Successful, Harshly Criticizes British Representative's Attitude

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 21st] Madame Pandit, head of the Indian delegation to the UN General Assembly, said in a speech at a public conference hosted by the Indian International Affairs Research Association tonight: "We have received strong support from China in the UN General Assembly and its committees. Chinese representative Dr. Wellington Koo has voted for us many times. Those who attended the meeting included Nehru, Gaffar (i.e., the Frontier Gandhi), Xue Shouheng, our representative in India, Shen Zonglian, head of our delegation to Nepal, and Merrill, the US representative in India. Madame Pandit's speech elaborated on the cooperation the Indian delegation received from representatives of other countries at the UN General Assembly. She praised the cooperation that the "Slavic bloc" gave to India, and she most emphasized the cooperation of the Soviet and Polish delegations. Her brief and prominent remarks about China showed that it was expected that the Indian representative would receive support from the Eastern countries at the General Assembly. The reason why she especially thanked Dr. Wellington Koo was to point out that China's support for India or Asian proposals at the General Assembly was very strong. She believed that the reason why the US representative could not cooperate with the Indian proposals was due to the "confusion" of US foreign policy. She expressed displeasure with the actions of the British representative at the General Assembly. Regarding the United Nations organization itself, she believed that although the United Nations organization has its weaknesses, future international disputes will be resolved by it. She pointed out that the veto power of the five major powers is necessary because the "Anglo-Saxon" countries and their satellite countries account for the vast majority.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 21st] Madame Pandit, the chief Indian delegate to the UN General Assembly, said tonight that all the opinions put forward by the Indian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly were undermined by Britain. Although the techniques used to undermine them were very secret and clever, they could not deceive anyone. The Indian delegation was fortunate to have made close contact with representatives of various Asian countries. Only the Turkish representative told me that Turkey was not interested in either Europe or Asia and only participated in the United Nations as a formality. Madame Ji said: India's victory over South Africa in the United Nations is a success of the United Nations organization. Today, India has won the sympathy of the world. After we gain complete freedom, we will be able to progress rapidly and are expected to surpass the current status of the Soviet Union in the short term.

[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, 22nd] According to a statement issued by the Japanese Central Meteorological Agency, one of the largest earthquakes in the world was the earthquake in Shanxi, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces in China in 1556, during the 35th year of the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty, which killed 830,000 people. The second was the great earthquake in Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, in 1755, which killed 60,000 people who were submerged by the tsunami at the time. The third was the great earthquake in San Francisco, USA, in 1906, which caused a major fire, but only killed 2,600 people. The fourth was the great earthquake in the Tokai region of Japan in 1707, which destroyed 29,000 houses and killed 4,900 people. The fifth was the Kanto earthquake in Japan in 1923, which killed about 70,000 people. Two-thirds of the houses in Tokyo were destroyed by fire, and almost all the houses in Yokohama were destroyed. The epicenter and force of this earthquake are similar to those of the great earthquake in Japan in 1707. Fortunately, the epicenter of this earthquake was at the bottom of the sea, which can be said to be a great blessing in misfortune. If it were on land, the disaster would be unknown.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 21st] The Soviet Communist Youth League's newspaper published an article today harshly criticizing the "dancing mania" that is popular in Soviet youth clubs.

Conclusion of Industry and Commerce Guidance Office Symposium

The Shanghai Industry and Commerce Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been holding symposiums with representatives from various industries for the past half-month, which have now concluded. The main difficulties include: (1) high-interest loans, (2) raw material shortages, (3) dumping of foreign goods, (4) insufficient electricity, (5) excessively high wages, and (6) high fuel prices. A reporter interviewed the person in charge of the office yesterday to inquire about the office's future policies and steps to assist various private industries. They were informed that after holding the symposiums with various industries, the Guidance Office has clearly understood the general difficulties and major hopes of each industry. Once the adjustment tables for each factory are collected and reviewed, a concrete plan can be formulated to provide practical assistance, ensuring that the private industry and commerce act as a bridge to the nation, promoting the government's economic policies on one hand, and supporting the private industry on the other hand, advocating for the strengthening of national construction. In principle, the steps of (1) loans, (2) maintenance, (3) guidance, and (4) rewards will be followed, and close contact will be established with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Fuel Control Committee, the Yarn Control Committee, the Import Management Committee, the Municipal Government, and the Public Utilities Bureau, to thoroughly explain all the actual difficulties of each industry. It is hoped that all the problems that private industries cannot solve on their own, such as production loans, raw materials, fuel, and electricity, can be resolved through the mediation of the Guidance Office.

### Kiessling & Bader Hotel: Property Rights Issue Arises

Austrian Nationals Request Return

The liquidation of German properties in the city has been ongoing for over a year, with many disputes and protracted delays. It is now learned that the property case of the Kiessling & Bader Hotel on Changde Road has raised questions of nationality. The Kiessling & Bader Hotel was founded by a German businessman during the war. After the victory, it was taken over and sealed by the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau. Recently, an Austrian national claiming to be the hotel's operator contacted the Enemy Property Bureau, requesting the return of the seized property rights, and claiming that the shareholdings held by the former German businessman had been transferred, and submitted various supporting documents. The Enemy Property Bureau, considering that this case involved nationality issues, specially requested the German Property Liquidation Office to collect the relevant documents for review, and also dispatched personnel for detailed investigation. If it is indeed the property of an Austrian national, the responsible person of the Austrian Consulate must prove that it is the property of an Austrian citizen before it can be returned according to law.

### Trial Operation of Dada Wharf Handling: Resolving the Livelihood of the Isolated Soldiers of the Four Lines Regiment

After the victory against the enemy, the eight hundred soldiers who were driven to various places by the enemy have been coming to Shanghai. However, due to the high cost of living in Shanghai, it is difficult for them to maintain their livelihoods. Ms. Ling Weicheng, the widow of the late Commander Xie, has made numerous appeals, applying to the municipal government and the municipal police bureau to allocate wharves for trial handling, both to serve the society and to maintain their livelihoods. On September 9th, they received approval No. 15047 from the Municipal Police Bureau, stating that "The wharf management regulations have not yet been issued, so registration is provisionally approved." The municipal government also issued approval No. 11903 on October 24th, stating that "The operation will be carried out after the wharf management regulations are promulgated and implemented in this city." The said wharf management regulations were promulgated in the newspaper on the 8th of this month. It is now learned that the isolated soldiers have invited [people] to take over the Dada Wharf in accordance with the management regulations and are willing to use the spirit of combat to overcome the enemy's reputation, hoping to eliminate the previous bad habits on the wharf and create a model wharf. It is said that Ms. Xie and the comrades who remained in Shanghai are deeply grateful to the mayor, Director Xuan, and various wharf authorities for their compassion for the isolated soldiers and for allocating the wharf to them, saving them from the worry of starvation.

It has a history of over 30 years. Before the War of Resistance, it was affiliated with the Jingjiang Public Association in Laoximen. When the war broke out and Shanghai fell, the association was interrupted. After the restoration of the homeland, Xu Qiuying was responsible for its restoration, and preparations have been underway since this summer. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the founding ceremony was held at No. 547 South Tibet Road to discuss the charter, elect directors and supervisors, and propose the construction of a Zhiguo Ci (Memorial Hall) to commemorate the elders of the hometown, such as Mr. Ma Xiangbo.

### Plot to Rob the Xinsheng Factory: Another Gang Member Apprehended

Partying in a Singer's Club

[Our Newspaper] At 6:30 PM on the 8th, five robbers broke into the Xinsheng Cotton Weaving Factory at No. 1212 Zhongzheng East Road. Fortunately, the Huangpu Branch received a report and, led by Director Du, surrounded and arrested the robbers. Two of the robbers acting as lookouts, Zhang Shaozhou and others, were apprehended at the time. The robbers who were still inside escaped over the rooftops, opened fire more than ten times and fought with the police, but eventually escaped without a trace. According to the confession of the apprehended robbers, a gang member, Chen Ada, was arrested in Room 24 of the Dalu Hotel on Tibet Road, and a firearm was seized.

### Three Chemical Groups Foster Friendship: Joint Annual Meeting Opened Yesterday

Vice Premier Weng Attended and Delivered a Speech: Hoping for Practical Effort, Not Seeking Fame

The joint annual meeting of the Chinese Chemical Society, the Chinese Chemical Industry Society, and the Chinese Chemical Engineering Society was held at 2:00 PM yesterday at the Central Research Institute on Qiqi Road. Wu Zhihui and Li Shizeng arrived at the meeting at 2:00 PM, but left before giving a speech due to other appointments. Chairman Wu Rundong delivered a speech, saying that he was unqualified to serve as chairman since he had long been separated from the laboratory and hoped that all comrades would return to the laboratory and contribute their lives. Xu Zishi, the director of the annual meeting preparation committee, reported that the general association was originally in Nanjing, but the annual meeting was decided to be held in Shanghai. The annual meeting was initiated by the Chinese Chemical Society purely to foster friendship, jointly work hard and contribute collectively. Vice Premier Weng Wenhao rushed to the meeting at 2:30 PM and gave a speech, saying that he was actually a geologist, but he attached great importance to chemistry. He studied chemistry in 1908 and believed that the mystery of the atom could not be broken, but now the atom has been broken, showing that scientific progress is very rapid. He hoped that people would work hard and practically, and persist. After returning from abroad in the first year of the Republic of China, he engaged in geology for 24 years. Later, due to the instability of North China, he resolved to enter politics for the sake of the overall national situation and abandoned geology. He hoped to engage in industry and mining in the future and contribute his remaining years. Therefore, he hoped that his chemical colleagues would work hard and practically, without seeking fame. Once they become famous, they will definitely change careers, become officials or principals, etc. Therefore, they must have an iron will and write books. Subsequently, Gao Enbo of the Chinese Chemical Society reported that the association was officially established on August 4th, 1932, and currently has 1,986 members. The journal was published in 1933, and Chemical Communications and the Chemical World were published in 1934, continuing without interruption. Wu Yuncho of the Chinese Chemical Industry Society said that the association was established in 1922, but it was not publicized, and the outside world mistakenly thought it had stopped, which was incorrect. The Chemical Industry Journal is currently published and has raised a fund of 16 million. He said that they would take on a joint responsibility amid the collapse of industry. Gu Zhen of the Chinese Chemical Engineering Society said that it was established in 1933 and publishes the Chemical Engineering Journal and association reports. Director Zhu Jiajian did not attend in person but sent a congratulatory telegram. Finally, the group visited the Central Research Institute.

### Crime Weapons Gathered Completely: Police Museum to Be Established on New Year's Day

The "Police Museum" prepared by the Municipal Police Bureau, under the order of Director Xuan, has been underway for half a year under the responsibility of Commissioner Ruan Guangming of the bureau, and is now ready. The museum displays various criminal tools, drugs, dangerous goods, and historical weapons, such as the soil cannons and soil guns from the Tongzhi years of the Qing Dynasty, bows, arrows, darts, whips, knives, guns, steel forks, and modern weapons such as various rifles and pistols. All are numbered, registered and have descriptions. Among the most valuable items are various genuine and counterfeit banknotes from China and abroad over the years, totaling more than 100 varieties. In addition, there are various photos of deaths, injuries, and punishments, as well as forged official seals and documents, gambling tools from China and abroad, and countless other items. It is reported that the bureau has collected various police museums from countries around the world, a large number of which are on their way by sea, specifically to provide the bureau's police officers and specialists with resources for crime research, as a technical reference for solving cases. It is said that Director Xuan, in order to urgently implement and promote the review of criminal case clues, has decided to formally establish the Police Museum on New Year's Day in the 36th year and open it to the public. However, its nature is different from other museums and is entirely within the scope of police affairs. All legal public organizations in the city can only be permitted to visit after submitting a written request and obtaining Director Xuan's approval.

### Wartime Factory Loss Registration: Investigation Work Will Take a Long Time

[Our Newspaper] As of this time, although there are no official statistics on the registration of wartime factory property losses in the city, it is estimated that there are about 1,000 cases. After the registration is completed, the Social Bureau will compile detailed statistics and publish them publicly. According to relevant sources, only a portion of the loss registrations are accompanied by photos and other supporting documents. In the future, there will inevitably be a large-scale investigation, which will still be carried out by local authorities. Because the years have passed and the reported figures are not entirely objective, the time required for the investigation is likely to be longer than the registration. The loss figures reported by the damaged factories are based on the estimated value at the time of the damage. How to convert them into the prices of July of the 26th year and then convert them into US dollars is still to be decided by the central government. The registration period for losses has been extended twice, originally scheduled to end at the end of June, then extended to November 15th, and now extended to the end of the year. As of now, there is no news of any further extensions.

### Two American Merchant Ships Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai Today

Both ships will leave Shanghai on the 26th. The Monroe will travel to the South Seas, then through the Mediterranean to the Atlantic and return to the United States. The General Gordon will travel to Hong Kong and Luzon before returning to Shanghai and then to the United States.

### Four Hundred Blankets Distributed Daily: Public and Private School Personnel Disappointed

The distribution of blankets to public and private school personnel in the city began on the 21st, distributed by the Public and Private School Personnel Supply Office, priced at 45,500 yuan per blanket. They were sold with Ziyou-numbered distribution stamps upon payment. However, the Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan limited the supply to 400 blankets per day, leaving those who arrived later disappointed. More than 80,000 public and private school personnel in the city have registered with the supply office and obtained certificates. If the Materials Supply Bureau continues to limit the supply to 400 blankets per day, it will inevitably be delayed until June or July of next year before all can be distributed. It is said that the number of people requesting distribution on the 21st was too crowded, and the Materials Supply Bureau increased the distribution by 400 blankets, but it was a drop in the bucket and still did not solve the problem. Now that the weather is cold, the need for blankets is urgent, so the general public and private school personnel hope that the Materials Supply Bureau can provide a large supply and complete the distribution before the end of the year to meet the actual needs.

### Fiftieth Anniversary of Postal Service: Commemorative Stamps Will Not Be Issued

Because this year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the postal service, the postal authorities intended to follow the example of the 40th anniversary of the postal service and issue 50th-anniversary commemorative stamps. Due to the postal service's lack of sufficient funds, it has been decided to abandon the idea of issuing 50th-anniversary commemorative stamps.

### Yihe Vessel Sacrificed in the War of Resistance: Wilkinson Posthumously Awarded Major

[Our Newspaper] The British Jardine Matheson's Yihe vessel was a shallow-water wheel steamer operating on the Yichang-Chongqing line of the Sichuan River, with a gross tonnage of only 707 tons and a length of 170 feet. In 1941, it was requisitioned by the navy and converted into a patrol warship. At 4:00 PM on February 14th of that year, the captain, Wilkinson, sighted two teams of Japanese armed transport ships, a total of fifteen ships, escorted by one Japanese destroyer and one large cruiser, off the coast of Singapore. The Yihe vessel had previously engaged in a fierce battle with Japanese aircraft, and the ship's hull was slightly damaged. The captain, Wilkinson, did not care for his own safety and opened fire at the enemy transport ships at a distance of 8,000 yards, hitting one large enemy transport ship, which immediately caught fire and sank. The Yihe vessel was eventually sunk by the enemy cruiser, and only a dozen people on the entire ship were rescued. Captain Wilkinson died at the same time as the ship. The British government commended Captain Wilkinson's meritorious service and posthumously awarded him the rank of naval major on the 17th of this month, and awarded him the Victoria Cross (the highest military medal in the United Kingdom). After learning of this, the company in this city also expressed their remembrance of the captain's righteousness.

### Christmas Trees Then and Now: The Biggest Customers Were Foreigners Who Have Mostly Returned Home

[Our Newspaper] Before the war, the brightly decorated and beautiful Christmas trees were a very large consumption during this festival. In the small area of ​​Jingan Temple Road alone, it was estimated that there were more than 2,000 branches. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Allied compatriots lived a difficult life in concentration camps, and the demand for Christmas trees decreased. However, on this day last year, the bells of liberation rang, and Christmas brought comfort and hope to the citizens. "Peace has come to the land of fire, and people meet with goodwill." Citizens enjoyed this festival in a joyful atmosphere. British and American expatriates emerged from the concentration camps. The American Navy, who had just arrived in Shanghai, spent as much of their wartime savings as possible in the market of this "Eastern Paris." The business of Christmas trees was also prosperous, and large stores in the Jingan Temple Road area sold more than 1,000 trees.

Time flies, and in the blink of an eye, another year has passed. The festival is approaching, and those who operate in the floral business have seen the situation last year and have made great preparations in advance. They have spared no effort to collect Christmas trees from Fenghua, Ningbo, Huzhou, and other places and transport them to Shanghai for sale. Generally speaking, Christmas trees can be divided into eleven types: The best are yews, which come from Fenghua and Ningbo. After skillful makeup, the largest ones sell for 180,000 to 200,000, and ordinary ones also have to sell for 70,000 to 80,000. The second best are firs, which are also transported from Fenghua and other places. Good ones sell for 50,000 to 60,000, and ordinary ones sell for 20,000 to 30,000. The most common are local junipers, which can be bought for 10,000 yuan. Flowers that decorate the Christmas festival also appear in various endearing poses, with prices ranging from 20,000 to 70,000 or 80,000. The main customers are mostly foreign women.

Is the Christmas tree business booming today? Will the labor of these florists be in vain? This question will have an accurate answer only after the 25th of this month. However, those engaged in this industry have some unfortunate premonitions. First of all, the biggest customers of Christmas trees are foreigners, but now these wealthy British and American expatriates are mostly spending the holidays peacefully in their hometowns. They have experienced the greatest risks in their lives in Shanghai and may have less attachment to Shanghai. Most of the American Navy in China is already in Qingdao, and only a few remain in Shanghai, and they are not really wealthy. As for the Chinese, the people in the church are few after all, and in this year, the market is tight, and the economy is not prosperous. The bosses are planning how to deal with the year-end bonuses, and the employees are considering how to pay off debts. The interest in Christmas is much lower than in the past. At the same time, material resources are scarce, and saving is the top priority, so the Christmas tree business is likely not as good as last year. However, there are also some unknown factors, such as the White Russians who have recently acquired Soviet nationality, who are cheering and celebrating and perhaps are using this Christmas to improve their luck!

### Customs Tightens Anti-Smuggling Work: Three Lines of Defense for Ships Entering the Port

[Our Newspaper] The situation of tax evasion and smuggling in the city is serious. Although the customs is tightening anti-smuggling work, smuggled goods are still found in the market from time to time. It is reported that most of the smuggled goods in Shanghai are first thrown into the sea outside the Wusongkou by ships and then transported to Shanghai by small boats via Wusong.

Smuggling and Tax Evasion are Not Easy

For this reason, the reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the Jianghai Customs to inquire about the details. They said that this may have been the case in the past, but it is probably impossible today. Foreign goods loaded on ships coming to Shanghai must go through three checkpoints. (1) There is a large ship of the Jianghai Customs outside Wusongkou, patrolling day and night. (2) A customs office is set up at Wusongkou, with a Deputy Commissioner of Customs stationed to be responsible for the investigation, and another ship is assisting in the work. (3) There are often boats patrolling the Huangpu River to prevent smuggling, so it is not easy to smuggle past these three checkpoints. Moreover, the customs has long stipulated that all ships traveling within twelve nautical miles of the national coastline, when the customs patrol boat issues various signals instructing them to stop, listen to the investigation, and do not comply, a blank cannon will be fired as a warning. If they resist again, the ship can be fired upon with live ammunition. However, the intention is not to sink the ship, but only to destroy its masts, mechanical parts, etc., to make it unable to sail. Recently, the customs has received an order from the Executive Yuan that, in order to strengthen the investigation and crackdown, naval ships will be temporarily borrowed, and customs officers will be stationed on the ships to carry out the investigation.

### Special Express Service Established for Long-Distance Calls between Nanjing and Shanghai

The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has recently established a special express telephone service to facilitate long-distance telephone users, effective from 0:00 on the 25th. The measures are as follows: (1) Connection time is less than ten minutes. (2) The price is calculated at double the rate of urgent calls. (3) The call number service will be temporarily opened. (4) Each phone call is limited to two calls. (5) The open locations are temporarily set in Shanghai and Nanjing. (6) Users who make special express calls must specify it when registering. It is also learned that special express telephone services in other locations will be opened one after another as soon as the installation is completed.

Although yesterday was a regular holiday, the investigation into the explosion at the No. 1 depot of the Jiangwan Second Armory did not stop. Relevant personnel were still being interrogated. However, due to the holiday at the Garrison Headquarters, the interrogation location was temporarily moved to the Garrison Department in the Disui Road area, within the Hudong Inspection Office. Starting at 2 PM, relevant personnel were brought in for questioning, including Deng, the section chief of the Ordnance Department of the First Supply District, who is currently in custody. Deng is not only the chief of the armory's main section but also the guarantor of the depot chief Wang Renshan. Now that Wang has fled to avoid punishment, Deng must bear considerable responsibility. The presiding interrogators were the same as the previous day: Bao Qihuang, Chief Military Judge of the Ministry of National Defense's Military Law Department, Yan Zi, Deputy Director of the Hudong Inspection Office, and Sheng Wuquan, Clerk. Contrary to rumors, Vice Minister Qin Decun did not participate in the interrogation. According to information obtained by the Central News Agency reporter from relevant sources, Qin Shouyu was also interrogated yesterday. Qin was the acting depot chief of the No. 1 depot of the Second Armory. He was previously arrested and dealt with for stealing and selling military equipment. Recently, the Ministry of National Defense approved a sentence of ten years imprisonment, and he has already been sent to prison. After Qin Shouyu was dismissed, Wang Renshan succeeded him as depot chief. Not long after taking office, this explosion occurred. It is reasonable that Qin was brought from prison for interrogation in this case. The trial work for all cases will continue at the Garrison Department military court starting today.

### Rice Store Robbery on Shangqiu Road: Bank Obtains Clues, Leading to the Arrest of the Robbers; One Robber Flees to Nanjing After the Crime

[Our Report] On the afternoon of the 17th, the Laodachang Rice Store at No. 370 Shangqiu Road, Hudong, was suddenly robbed. A brief account was published in yesterday's newspaper. Here is a more detailed account: At about 5 PM that afternoon, two robbers suddenly entered the store. One was wearing a khaki military uniform and carrying a handgun, while the other was wearing a dark-colored short shirt and trousers and carrying two grenades. They entered the store, prohibiting anyone from making a sound. The one in military uniform guarded the store employees, while the one in plain clothes searched the bedroom and robbed a total of 280,000 yuan in legal tender, a Zheyue Bank check for 124,000 yuan, and a gold ring each from employee Wang Chengji and the store owner's wife. They then fled through the front door. At 4:30 PM the next afternoon, the store owner, Shen Yuzhang, returned to Shanghai from his hometown and reported the case to the Tilanqiao Police Station. The branch director, Zhang Renyou, knowing that it would be more difficult to pursue the case after a day had passed, quietly instructed the second section chief, Ma Zhuyu, to conduct a secret investigation. On the 21st, plainclothes police officers Yuan Qitai and Sun Hongbin were dispatched to wait at the Zhejiang Xingye Bank. Around 11 AM, Zhu Wenda, an apprentice from the Taikang Tailor Shop, came to the bank at No. 19 to cash the check. He was immediately taken to the station and confessed that his elder sister, Zhu Liju, had given it to him to withdraw the money. Later, Zhu Liju was arrested and stated that Tang Jiquan, who lived in a wooden shack on Xi'an Road, had given her the check to pay off a debt and that she did not know the source of the check. Police chief Fan Yunxing and police officers Qi Shaonong and Lu Dianyao were dispatched to arrest the robber Tang Jiquan at his address, where they confiscated a Japanese-style handgun, 71 bullets, and two grenades. Another accomplice, a retired soldier (who owned all the weapons), had already gone to Nanjing to visit friends the day after the robbery. The police station is currently conducting a strict search.

### Undesirable Elements' Special Profession: Extorting Those Who Held Positions in the Puppet Regime; Victims Include Lawyer Zhang Tong and Others

[Our Report] The Lao Zha sub-bureau recently received a tip that a group of undesirable elements were extorting money from people in the Hankou Road and Zhejiang Road area every evening under false pretenses. After investigation by the bureau, three suspects were arrested a few days ago: Yang Yiming, 34 years old, from Zhenjiang; Yuan Genfa, 36 years old; and Feng A'wu, also known as Xiao Wuxi, 39 years old, all from Wuxi. During interrogation, they confessed to extorting 7,000 yuan from Ding Haofu on Fuzhou Road and a large sum of money from Zhang Tong, a lawyer during the "puppet organization" era, in front of the Laobanzhai restaurant on Hankou Road. Since he didn't have cash, they pawned his watch for 80,000 yuan and gave it to them. They met Xu, who was a Japanese translator in Wuxi during the war, on Nanjing Road, and extorted money from him, taking a coat worth 40,000 yuan as compensation. They extorted 300,000 yuan in legal tender from Chen Boying, a former railway employee in Central China, on Jinling Road. The bureau will transfer the case to the court for prosecution on a regular basis.

### Huang Yanpei Sells Calligraphy [Not for Poverty]

Since the breakdown of the KMT-CPC peace talks, Huang Yanpei has been reading books behind closed doors, living in seclusion. Recently, due to economic difficulties, he has been selling his calligraphy to support himself and has written a poem to introduce himself. The poem reads: "Why does an old man sell calligraphy? Not ashamed to sell to alleviate poverty. Having promised to write inscriptions on all mountains, I might as well form new [calligraphic] connections in the sea of ink. [If I] take it by chance, I am truly ashamed; earning a living is also hard work. Of the eight methods [of calligraphy], the mind comes first, the brush must be upright; learning to be a person at the pool in old age." It is said that his prices are 50,000 yuan for a couplet, 40,000 yuan for a fan, and 40,000 yuan for a vertical scroll, with a 20% surcharge for ink. Delivery is one week, and submissions can be made at the China Vocational Education Society at No. 80 Yandang Road, among other places.

### From Nourishing Prescriptions to Traditional Chinese Medicine

When talking about winter tonics, one must mention nourishing prescriptions (gaozi yao). Traditionally, Chinese medicine stores are busy in the summer and profitable in the winter, with the profit coming from the sale of these nourishing prescriptions. Because many nourishing prescriptions contain precious medicinal ingredients, such as ginseng and deer antlers, and when solidifying the prescription, donkey-hide gelatin and turtle plastron gelatin must be used, which are also considered treasures. This year, a dose of nourishing prescription may cost no less than 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. The interest rates of medicine stores are inherently high, so if they can receive a few more nourishing prescription orders, they can happily celebrate the New Year, right?

Traditional Chinese medicine, except for a few that use animals and minerals, mostly consists of plants, with the producing areas distributed throughout the country, with Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces producing the most. Traditional Chinese medicine also has a characteristic, which is that the medicinal properties of what is produced in area A are different from those produced in area B. Therefore, Chinese medicine stores advertise "authentic medicinal materials," indicating that the producing area is correct. Medicinal materials from various places are purchased from the producing areas by raw medicine traders, and medicine stores then wholesale them from raw medicine traders. After medicinal materials are purchased, they must be processed. The signboard "Prepared according to ancient methods" comes from this. However, many small medicine stores often do not have time to prepare them according to ancient methods, often doing things "carelessly".

There are more than 400 Chinese medicine stores in the city.

The most time-honored is Jiang Yanze, with more than 200 years of history. Hu Qingyutang was established here after being separated from Hangzhou after the founding of the Republic, but its scale and business are unmatched by any other medicine store in Shanghai. No matter what kind of precious medicinal material or rare pill or powder there is, it will not be without it. As for Xu Chongdao's branches, they are all over Shanghai, which is another style. A medicine store employee must know thousands of herbal medicines, thousands of pills, powders, and elixirs. It is not possible for a layperson to cope with this, so they mostly come from apprenticeship backgrounds. In small medicine stores, an employee has to do everything, at most being divided into the pill and powder department and the prepared slice department. But in large medicine stores, each has its own specialty. Those who slice are called Knife Masters, those who pack medicine in small drawers are called Drawer Room, and those who manufacture pills and powders also have someone specifically in charge. In extremely large-scale Hu Qingyutang, there are five major rooms and six minor rooms: prepared slices room, pill and powder room, fine ingredient room, large ingredient room, and knife room belong to the major rooms; medicine picking room, ledger room, fine nourishing prescription room, fine goods room, and herbal medicine room, product room belong to the minor rooms. All employees are about 300.

Selling an Ounce, Buying a Pound

Opening a medicine store is a good business, the so-called "buying with large scales, selling with small scales." Their profits are very considerable. It is very common for medicine with a normal cost of 1,000 yuan to be sold for 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. There are several kinds of medicine that, when selling an ounce, can be used to buy a pound. What kind of benefit is this? However, there are also difficulties in selling so expensive. Many rare and precious medicines often have no inquiries after four or five years. At the same time, many medicines will go bad during the plum rain season every year, so they have to do so. This refers to large medicine stores. Small medicine stores do not prepare many valuable medicines. After the moldy medicines are picked out, they are sold again. Therefore, it is much cheaper to go to small medicine stores to fill prescriptions. Although the guild has now unified prices, small medicine stores are still more discounted.

Brewing Medicine for Customers

Brewing medicine for customers was invented by Xu Chongdao. In the past, many large medicine stores were arrogant, and they still refuse to brew medicine for customers. However, nourishing prescriptions have always been brewed by medicine stores, and even purple copper pots, charcoal stoves, and presses are carried to your residence to stew and simmer in person to show respect. The brewing method of nourishing prescriptions is different from ordinary medicines. The amount of medicine is large, and the medicinal properties must be distinguished and soaked. When brewing, which ingredients are brewed first, which ingredients are put in later, how much time is used with a strong fire, and how much time is used with a slow fire, all have requirements. Especially the last stage of "solidifying the prescription," how to use donkey-hide gelatin, and when to add rock sugar, cannot be done at will. A person who doesn't know how to brew medicine simply doesn't know how to turn this large pot of medicinal materials into a small ceramic jar, wasting many valuable medicines for nothing. Fortunately, nourishing prescriptions are a good sale in medicine stores, so they do not hesitate to move their dignity and teach people to boil them.

Beijing-Made Proprietary Medicines, Famous Throughout the Country

Many proprietary medicines in traditional Chinese medicine are very famous. Lei Yunsheng's Six-God Pill is sold to Japan and Nanyang, with huge annual sales. Others such as Hu Qingyutang's Plague-Expelling Pill and Tong Hanchun's Regeneration Pill are famous proprietary medicines. On the opening day of the former Beijing Hongrentang, 60 dan of donkey-hide gelatin were sold. There are also many tonics among the proprietary medicines, such as Hundred-Tonic Paste and Golden Deer Pill, which have tonic properties. Beijing-made proprietary medicines have always been famous throughout the country. Xia Tieying created the Beijing Medicine Bureau, specializing in the sale of Beijing-made proprietary medicines. Among them, tonics such as Nine-Heaven Great Tonic Paste and Ninety-Nine Rejuvenation Liquor sold well, but unfortunately they soon closed.

If the medicine is wrong, it concerns human life. In Shanghai, there have been several times when the wrong medicine was dispensed, or the medicines of two families were switched, causing minor illnesses or death. Afterward, the patient's family found evidence from the medicinal residue and sued the law. As a result, the medicine store secretly hired someone to come out and compensate the matter. This is the intangible loss of the medicine store, but if the court investigates and tests, the medicine store may not be fully responsible, but the reputation of the medicine store is affected. Therefore, what can be seen in the newspaper is only a very small number.

Many medicine stores, for the sake of business, invite doctors to set up clinics in the store. Several small medicine stores, with only enough space for knees, actually hang up the signboard of "Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor ××× Clinic." In today's housing shortage, doctors of course get a ready-made place to set up a clinic, and medicine stores can also do more business. The so-called "boats help the water, water helps the boats" is also true. There are also many small medicine stores that contact doctors with sluggish business and implement a sending diagnosis method. Patients have been deceived by the sending diagnosis, of course, they will not go to another store to buy medicine.

Now, scientific medicine is very popular, but the business of Chinese medicine stores is still not greatly affected. But seeing people progressing rapidly, while Chinese medicine stores are still stuck in the old ways, it is inevitable that the prospect is an obstacle. Many raw medicinal materials are shipped overseas every year, refined and then imported back to China, which is a great omission. At the same time, many effective proprietary medicines in traditional Chinese medicine, the formulas are often kept secret and eventually lost, which is also a very regrettable thing. Those engaged in the business of Chinese medicine should pay attention.

Deer Herd Under the Pine Breeze of Ten Thousand Valleys

### Tonics in Western Medicine

When scientific medicine first entered, the Chinese people did not trust it very much. Even now, in big cities, many people still miss our "national essence" - traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese medicine. Among the tonics in Western medicine, cod liver oil was the first to be welcomed by the Chinese people, and the "Debacle" cod liver oil sold for a while. Later, the discovery of "Vitamin" made people feel even more novel. Many tonics, tonics, and pills have been adopted by the Chinese people one after another.

In Shanghai's Western medicine industry, the founding was the British-owned Great Britain Pharmacy, established in the sixth year of Guangxu. In the thirtieth year of Guangxu, Great Britain Pharmacy employee Sun Songquan raised funds to establish the Sino-Western Pharmacy on Quanzhou Road. This was the beginning of Chinese people operating the new medicine industry. At that time, the profits were very abundant, so the Chinese employees of various foreign pharmacies set up their own stores one after another, with the Sino-French, Sino-British, and Sino-English Five Continents and other pharmacies. At that time, although there were many pharmacies, the business was not affected, and there was a profit to be made every year.

Initially, the operation of Western medicine was purely for sales purposes. After the founding of the Republic of China, several larger companies tried to set up factories to manufacture on their own, such as the artificial Zilai blood of Wuzhou Pharmacy and the Ren Dan of Sino-French Pharmacy, both of which had their history and status in the past. As more operators gradually emerged, the scope of business also gradually shrank. Photographic materials were seized by photo shops exclusively, cosmetics were occupied by Kuang Sheng and other household industry companies, and dental equipment was handled by dental merchants. At the same time, competition among the same industry was extremely fierce, and the selling price of famous European Western medicines was even lower than the cost. At this point, the appearance of Western medicine, which was outwardly strong but inwardly weak, has gradually been exposed.

Manufacturing New Drugs, Profits Doubled

During the decline of the Western medicine industry, each pharmacy paid attention to manufacturing, because the profit from selling finished medicines was meager, and there was even a risk of losing money. It is better to manufacture new medicines, which may be doubled. So they imitated European and American finished medicines to make profits. There are also factories specializing in pharmaceuticals. For example, the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory originally made cosmetics, but after the September 18th Incident, it switched to making various injectable medicines. In the nineteenth year, the Yiyi Pharmaceutical Factory, operated by German businessmen, was also taken over by the Chinese. Other small pharmaceutical factories also sprung up like mushrooms after rain.

Manufacturing new medicines mostly imitates European and American formulas. At first, only simpler ones were selected, and gradually those with more complex properties. Finally, new medicines were created, and attention was paid to traditional Chinese medicine raw materials, which were refined. For example, Minsheng Pharmaceutical Factory's Ansoulu is a combination of traditional Chinese medicine ingredients such as Dazhi, Platycodon, Fritillaria, and Apricot Kernel. This situation seems to be a major advance in the new medicine industry. In recent years, the Chinese people's belief in Western medicine has gradually increased, and more and more people are taking Western medicine. The new medicine industry could have flourished. No such scientific backwardness, although many domestic Western medicines have been produced, many finished products are still no match for imported goods, and special drugs cannot be relied on for import. The products of Bayer, Schering, and Merck in Germany, and Lily, Purdue, and Pfizer in the United States, and Beauvais in the United Kingdom still occupy a very large market share in Shanghai.

Many Kinds of Tonics

There are many kinds of tonics in Western medicine, too many to enumerate. The popular tonics in the early years, which enhanced blood circulation and promoted the function of metabolism, were mostly iron preparations. The domestic artificial Zilai blood belongs to this category. Later, animal organs were used to replenish the human body, such as hormones made from endocrine and liver paste made from beef liver. Organ therapy has already been discussed in Chinese medical books, but it is not scientific. Westerners have improved it with scientific methods, and it has become the most effective tonic. With the progress of chemotherapy, more tonics have been made, such as various vitamins, which are also widely popular.

A more popular tonic is cod liver oil. Cod liver oil is refined from the liver of cod, and the northern part of Norway has the highest output. The folk customs of Northern Europe have been used as food for a long time, and it is also used for the treatment of joint inflammation. In the eighteenth century, it was first known that cod liver oil could treat rickets and pulmonary tuberculosis. In 1926, it was discovered that cod liver oil contains vitamin D, so it can cure pulmonary tuberculosis. Therefore, the production, manufacture, and consumption of cod liver oil is becoming more and more widespread, and it has formed an indissoluble bond with pulmonary tuberculosis. Recently, it has been discovered that cod liver oil has the effect of inhibiting the development of bacteria. Not only tuberculosis bacteria, but also pyogenic bacteria and anaerobic bacteria are affected by it.

Cod liver oil is a fluid fat with a light yellow color. Although the tonic power is great, it has an unusual fishy odor, and many people cannot swallow it. Mothers force children to take it, and children almost cry when they smell its fishy odor. Therefore, some people try to reconcile it with other things to reduce the fishy odor and make it taste better. Malt Essence Cod Liver Oil and Milky White Cod Liver Oil are made in this way. Finally, the cod liver oil is refined into an essence or made into pills, which is more convenient.

Most of the cod liver oil sold in Chinese pharmacies is imported from abroad in its original barrels, and then packaged and prepared. Among the refined products, such as the Trustworthiness and Health's Haolisheng and New Asia's Hailiming, their ingredients and effects are no less than those of imported products.

Vitamin has become a household name today, and everyone knows that it is the main nutrient. But when it comes to categories, ingredients, and the relationship to the human body, many people don't know. The inventor of vitamin was Casmir Funk of Cambridge, England, who separated a substance that prevents beriberi from rice husks and believed that it was a type of armine. Because it is related to the human body, it is named vitamin.

Vitamins are generally divided into five types: A, B, C, D, and E. In fact, from the perspective of chemical composition and effects on the human body, they are not so simple. But vitamin is not a special thing, it is found in general food, and if you pay attention to diet at ordinary times, the nutrition is very sufficient, and vitamin deficiency will not occur. However, the vitamins in food are often lost due to cooking or destroyed due to corruption, so there are symptoms of vitamin deficiency. The medical community is working to extract vitamins for treatment. However, according to people in the medical community, taking too many vitamins also has drawbacks, which must be known.

During the War

During the war, countries were short of food, and soldiers on the front lines suffered from insufficient nutrition. Vitamins were the main weapon to combat diseases caused by malnutrition, so they were manufactured one after another. The United States produced the most. The vitamins manufactured in 1944 were worth 47 million US dollars. After the war, the trade volume of American vitamins was even greater.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the source of Western medicines was blocked, and Shanghai medicine merchants competed to hoard them. Several special medicines became scarce and profitable. Pharmaceutical factories also made a lot of money due to market demand. After the victory, American medicines, led by DDT, were transported in large quantities. Like vitamin pills, one person was five steps away, and a store was ten steps away, shouting and selling along the street, so that the sales of domestic products were sluggish. Since the news of purchasing surplus materials from the US military on Pacific islands came out, the pharmacists have been uneasy. Looking forward to the future of the Western medicine industry, it can be said that it is in a severe crisis. Foreign goods are flooding in, and expenses are huge. Now most of them are in a semi-operational state. To save this serious situation, everyone must work hard.

### Nurse's Side Job: Giving Injections in Spare Time

"Home injections, intravenous and intramuscular injections, Miss Electric ××× No. ×."

In the classified ads of the local newspaper, you can often find this type of advertisement. The short two or three lines embellish the space and can be considered a unique business in Shanghai.

Winter is a time for tonics, and injections are popular because of their effectiveness. But injecting medicines is a specialized skill that ordinary people cannot do themselves. They must consult nurses. Therefore, this specialized profession of injecting tonics has emerged. They are nurses or midwives with medical knowledge, and most of them still work in hospitals. In today's high cost of living, hospital treatment may not be enough to maintain life, so they have to find other ways to earn extra income, so they use their spare time to give injections.

Don't underestimate this simple and easy job. When it's busy, the income is considerable in a winter. Now, subcutaneous and intramuscular injections cost 3,000 to 4,000 yuan per time. Injections of tonics require dozens of injections, so isn't there an income of hundreds of thousands of yuan? However, running around in wind and snow is also quite hard. At the same time, transportation is difficult in urban areas now, and it takes a lot of time. For distant places, a considerable fare must also be paid.

### Ginseng, Deer Velvet, and Bird's Nest

Ginseng

Ginseng is known as the king of tonics. It is called ginseng because its shape resembles a human. The best ginseng is produced in Jilin and the Ussuri River region. There is a saying in Northeast China: "The three treasures of the three eastern provinces are ginseng, deer velvet, and Ula grass." Except for Ula grass, all are tonics, and ginseng is the most precious.

Ginseng grows deep in the forests of the old mountains, but it must not be shaded by trees. It must have sunlight to grow. Its growth process can be divided into six stages. From one to five years, it grows a palmate leaf, commonly known as "bazhangzi." From five to ten years, it grows leaves, each called "erlai shi." Twenty years produce three leaves, called "santaizi." Thirty years produce four leaves, called "sipinyie." From thirty to forty to fifty years, and from fifty to sixty years, it grows six leaves in full, which means it has grown long. Ginseng that is sixty years old is already very valuable. If the roots, head, body, and limbs are complete, it can be sold for a good price. The newly grown leaves are tender green. At one hundred years, they gradually turn yellow. Ginseng that is five hundred years old has tender yellow leaves. Ginseng that is a thousand years old turns old yellow and has bright red flowers, which is extremely rare.

Ginseng is not easy to harvest. Ginseng collectors usually enter the mountains in teams between August and September, about twenty people in a group, spaced hundreds of steps apart, responding to each other, and carrying weapons to prevent bandits and wild animals. Ginseng collectors must find ginseng seedlings among thousands of flowers, so they must have special experience to do this. If they find a ginseng seedling, they shout "bangchui," tie it with a red thread, spread oilcloth, and dig it while lying down. When digging, use an ox horn shovel or jujube wood shovel, because touching the roots with metal will disperse the essence. Dig out the soil three feet away from the roots. As you dig closer, when you see golden yellow soil, gently loosen the soil with your hands. Then, take the ginseng with one hand and lift the seedling with the other, and take it out of the soil at the same time. If it cannot be completed in one day, stay and guard it until the whole ginseng is taken out. Display sacrificial offerings and kowtow to thank the mountain god. If the ginseng obtained is a large ginseng with six leaves, a whole sheep must be used as a sacrifice.

Ginseng is a tonic and occupies an important position in the herbal pharmacopoeia. But it is very snobbish and only associates with the rich and powerful. When the rich and powerful get sick, it is indispensable. All kinds of deficiencies and damages can be treated with it. It is warming but not drying, and nourishing but not heating. These are all slogans that make it popular. We see the ginseng shop of Duiheng Wangyu on Xian Gua Street in the city before the war, and its prestige made the poor flinch.

Deer Velvet

Deer are beautiful, covered in radiant brownish-yellow velvet, interspersed with circles of pure white spots. The pair of slender antlers on their heads are like the flowers inserted in the gauze hats of top scholars in old dramas. No wonder they are beside themselves with joy when they see their reflection drinking by the pool. Many people also believe that deer have an ethereal quality. Their graceful appearance is indeed devoid of any worldly air. Precisely because of their fairy-like qualities, they are often used as decorations for gardens. In the Qing Dynasty, thousands of deer were raised in the Rehe Imperial Palace. Watching them gallop under the rustling pines evokes thoughts of transcending the mundane.

Only male deer have antlers; female deer do not. The antlers of young deer are like sprouts at first, with skin covering them. The swollen part of the skin looks like a birthmark. This is the famous medicinal material deer velvet. Deer velvet grows on the head, bathing in the sunlight, so it has a red color. It is extremely hot in nature and functions to replenish yang, having the effect of causing withered trees to sprout. Deer velvet produced in the Northeast is called Guandong deer, which is even more precious. In the past, it was a medium for relationships among princes and ministers, and a high-end gift in officialdom.

We consider deer velvet to be a precious tonic, which is considered strange by most Europeans, but it aroused their curiosity. Professor Pavlenko, a specialist in endocrine studies, studied the chemistry, biology, and pharmacology of deer velvet for a long time. He collected many deer heads for experiments and found that the Chinese were not wrong in their use of medicine. Deer velvet is very rich in male gonadal hormones, which are indeed excellent tonics for the human body. But when we take dried deer velvet powder, the nourishing ingredients have already been lost. So he made it into a liquid for oral administration or subcutaneous injection, which is more effective, especially for sexual weakness. In Chinese medicine stores, deer have many uses. In addition to the precious deer velvet, the entire body can be used as medicine. Therefore, large pharmacies often raise their own deer. Hu Qingyutang in Hangzhou has a deer enclosure for people to browse. Several pharmacies in Shanghai occasionally get a deer and put it in the courtyard as a live signboard. When killing a deer, you cannot be casual. First, choose an auspicious time, feed the deer good food, and then light famous incense and giant candles. The owner, manager, deer feeder, and slaughterer bow to the deer to show a sense of reluctance, which shows their prudence.

Bird's Nest

Bird's nest is produced in the Nanyang region. It is the nest built by swiftlets. The swiftlets are as big as birds and build their nests on cliffs, shaped like sponges and arranged in no particular order. The nest is made by sticking seaweed together. When building the nest, the seaweed is first swallowed into the stomach, fermented by the gastric juices, and then spit out, becoming gelatinous. Another saying is that it is the viscous liquid secreted by the swallow's mouth. When swiftlets eat fish, saliva flows between the sea caves, which become food when molting in winter. Over time, they solidify into nests.

Every time the bird's nest harvesting season arrives, the natives take tools, prepare food, and go in groups. Harvesting is very difficult. They often hang ropes on the coast, between dangerous cliffs, hundreds of feet long. They have to climb the cliffs to get them. The old and weak fall to their deaths. Those who undertake this work are all local natives, who climb up and down with great agility. When they reach a high place, their hands hang on the concave parts of the cliff, looking as small as flies from a distance. The nests are attached to the coast and come off easily when picked, falling onto black excrement, so they are mostly complete. Companions see this, pick up the nests, wipe off the bird droppings, and take them out of the cave.

Bird's nests produced in E'luo are of the highest quality. The signboards of Nanyang goods stores often prominently display the four characters "Siamese Imperial Bird's Nest" to boast of their quality. Those who operate bird's nest in Siam are all overseas Chinese. Many overseas Chinese have become wealthy from this business. The method of operation is to first lend money to the natives, and then have the natives deliver the bird's nests as they are harvested.

Bird's nests with a pure white color are considered to be of the highest quality, which is what is called imperial bird's nest. Those with feathers mixed in, black and with blood stains, are called Mao Yan. They are composed of fine, grayish-white strips, which become soft and large when soaked in water. They are rich in collagen, so they are highly nourishing. Medical books say that they can nourish yin, reduce fire, resolve phlegm, stop coughing, clear the lungs, nourish the body, and prolong life, so they are regarded as precious tonics. Wealthy families use bird's nest as tonics. High-end banquets also use bird's nest as the main dish. There was a time when shark fin was banned, and bird's nest banquets became popular for a while.

Sichuan, known as the land of abundance, has many special products that are highly valued, especially white fungus, which is considered the most nourishing. White fungus is produced in western and northern Sichuan, with many good quality products from Wanyuan, Tongjiang, Guangyuan, and Zuning counties. Guizhou also produces it, but it is not as good as that produced in Sichuan.

White fungus is a variation of black fungus. Those in Sichuan who operate black fungus purchase "qingkang" trees every early summer, saw them into sections of three or four feet, called "tongzi," and place them in a shady, humid place. Soon, black fungus grows, which is shoveled and dried for sale. Sometimes the wood suddenly changes and produces white fungus. The price can be ten times that of black fungus, but once it grows, it will not grow again, and the wood becomes waste, as the wood's energy is exhausted in one go. The cost of the wood is very high, so those who operate this business consider it unfortunate if white fungus is produced. Now, people in Sichuan already know how to select special trees for the sole purpose of producing white fungus. In spring and autumn, when white fungus production is at its peak, it is harvested every three to five days. After taking it home, remove the bad ones, cut off the roots, wash it in clear mountain springs, select it again, and then string it into bunches with bamboo skewers or hemp thread and place it on the stove to bake. The fire must be strong but smokeless. Bake for four or five hours, being careful not to scorch it, otherwise it will be inferior. Fifty taels of large, fresh white fungus only yields one tael after drying, so it is conceivable how rare it is.

White fungus can treat blood deficiency, heart and kidney deficiency, and physical weakness. It is said to have a significant effect on difficult-to-treat lung diseases. However, white fungus is moistening, so it may not be suitable for obese people with damp phlegm. According to its name, white is the best color. When choosing, select those that are round and large like walnuts and clear white in texture. People in Sichuan call it "paozi yiner." Forgers often put broken white fungus in containers, add glutinous rice soup, and gradually stir it until it solidifies. It is also round and large, like "paozi," but the substance is slightly heavier, and experts can tell at a glance that it is fake.

### Suppressing Prices and Eliminating Hoarding: The Social Affairs Bureau Decides to Take Decisive Measures. Reserves of Essential Supplies are Extremely Sufficient. Citizens Can Report Price Manipulation.

Recently, the prices in this city have risen sharply in succession due to the stimulation of soaring gold prices, which has greatly affected people's livelihoods. As the Social Affairs Bureau of the city is responsible for this, it has decided to strictly suppress it. According to the person in charge of the bureau: The prices in this city have been rising several times a day recently, and the bureau has been paying close attention to it. Now, citizens can be informed that the reserves of essential supplies such as rice, cooking oil, and sugar in this city are extremely sufficient, and the sources are smooth. There is no risk of interruption. In order to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, the bureau has now decided to take decisive measures. Those who manipulate prices and hoard goods will be severely punished without leniency. Starting today, the bureau will sell large quantities of rice in the market in order to suppress the rising trend, and has sent letters to Hezhong Sugar and other companies and the China Vegetable Oil Factory, requesting them to sell sugar and oil without restriction starting today. Therefore, the prices of rice, bran, and oil will definitely drop in the near future. As for the fuel problem, the source of coal is already very smooth. Within one or two days, 6,500 tons of Hongji coal dust will arrive in Shanghai. Recently, 10,000 tons of white coal from the Fushun Coal Mine will also come to Shanghai. Therefore, there is no shortage of coal for people's livelihoods, and its price will be self-regulating. As for kerosene, under the unscrupulous manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, the price has soared. The bureau has now decided to do its best to suppress it, and has negotiated with companies such as Asia and Texaco, deciding that these companies will sell it without restriction. In short, the bureau has a great determination to suppress prices, and also has absolute certainty. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens will not be confused by rumors and avoid being taken advantage of by unscrupulous merchants. In addition, citizens can directly report situations such as price manipulation and hoarding of goods by unscrupulous merchants to the Price Management Section of the Economic Administration Department of the bureau. If the prices of supplies such as oil, rice, cotton cloth, woolen yarn, and coal balls exceed the price limits set by the bureau, they can also be reported. Once discovered, they will be severely punished.

### The Future of Paper Mills is Precarious. Only Six of the Fifteen State-Run Paper Mills are Operating. The Twenty-Three Private Paper Mills are All Small in Scale.

Due to the impact of foreign paper dumping, the future of the paper industry in this city is in jeopardy. At present, only state-run paper mills can barely maintain operations. These paper mills are all former Japanese factories that have been reorganized. There are fifteen in total. Among them, in addition to Donghua Paper Products Printing, Shanghai Paper Products, Shanghai Processing, and Gaolin Cardboard, which are four cardboard or carton factories, the three companies of Jing Shang Toyo and Shanghai Paper Industry are all small in scale. The more important ones are Tianzhang and Jiangnan. However, the newspapers they produce are not of high quality. All the products are gray newspaper. Currently, only six of the fifteen state-run paper mills are operating. As for private paper mills, there are only twenty-three at present. Their products are mostly cardboard boxes. The factories that were operating last month are listed below: A. State-run Paper: (1) Tianzhang Original Paper Eastern Factory (producing banknote paper). (2) Tianzhang Western Factory (producing newspaper). (3) Jiangnan First Factory (producing banknote paper). (4) Jiangnan Second Factory (producing banknote paper). (5) Dazhonghua (producing newspaper). (6) Jing Shang (producing newspaper). B. Private Paper: (1) Datong, (2) Dalu, (3) Zhonghe, (4) Zhonghua, (5) Zhongguo, (6) Tianyi, (7) Minxing, (8) Shui'an, (9) Guangjin, (10) Liyong, (11) Xin'an, (12) Huazhang, (13) Hualun, (14) Huasheng, (15) Huali, (16) Haifeng, (17) Hailong, (18) Shenzhou, (19) Jinlun, (20) Qinye, (21) Rongchang. (22) Xingye.

### The Authorities Will Send Personnel to Inspect the North and South Rice Markets Today.

Recently, rice prices have risen sharply again, and the common people are feeling threatened. Mayor Wu has always attached great importance to the stability of rice prices. At this time of economic distress, he cannot allow rice prices to rise sharply. Therefore, he stated that the prices of all rice must be in accordance with the reviewed prices, and that Shanghai has sufficient reserves and smooth sources from various places. There is absolutely no problem with rice, and there is no reason to raise prices. He has already ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to closely monitor rice market transactions. It is reported that the relevant authorities have decided to send personnel to inspect the north and south markets today. If it is found that there is price gouging, hoarding of goods, or similar circumstances, they will be banned and severely punished.

Another news item: The reporter made a special visit to the person in charge of grain administration in this city yesterday. He was told: The rising trend of food prices is indeed due to the stimulation of the gold-dollar exchange rate, but most of it is actually caused by manipulation by unscrupulous merchants. The Shanghai General Warehouse of the Ministry of Food yesterday sent personnel to Wuxi to extract 50,000 dan of white rice that had been purchased and stored in Wuxi for storage in Shanghai, and will distribute it when necessary. In addition, 30,000 tons of foreign rice will be imported within a few days, totaling more than 370,000 dan, which is enough for the city's needs in August. Some unscrupulous merchants and hoarders are currently hoarding and not selling, but they will definitely be hit in the short term, because high interest rates are the fatal weakness of hoarding. He is absolutely optimistic about the future of the rice market and expects prices to fall within a few days.

### Hong Kong Trade Declines: Imports and Exports in November are Both Lower Than in October.

According to Hong Kong government import and export statistics, Hong Kong's total trade in November this year decreased compared to October.

### The Shipping Industry Establishes a Specialized Committee. Disaster Relief Work Begins on New Year's Day.

In order to promote its work and resolve various difficulties in the shipping industry, the Shipping Industry Association has decided to establish the following specialized committees through the decision of the Board of Directors and Supervisors: (1) Industry Cooperation Committee, (2) Compensation Committee, (3) Ship Purchasing Committee, (4) Ship Self-Insurance Preparation Committee, (5) Disaster Relief Committee, (6) Rate Committee, (7) Shipping Uniform Document Committee, (8) Accounting Uniformity Committee, (9) Public Relations Committee. The Disaster Relief Committee was formally established last Saturday. The committee members are Li Bangban Zhenxian from the Executive Yuan, Xue Baokang, Hu Shi, Deputy Manager of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Yu Shunwei, from the Shipping Association, Yu Haoyun, Li Zhiyi, Lu Yuzhi, Li Yunliang, and others. Hu Shiyuan was publicly elected as the director of the committee. After the meeting, it was decided to divide state-run and private ships into six groups to rescue military supplies, public goods, and refugees, and other special transportation matters. It is now scheduled to officially start disaster relief work on New Year's Day next year. The remaining eight committees will be established successively on New Year's Day next year.

### Lack of Raw Materials and Exchange Losses: Flower and Lace Exports Plummet. The Government is Urgently Expected to Provide Assistance.

[Our newspaper] The flower and embroidery industry has always been one of China's important handicrafts. Before the war, no fewer than 10 million people in the coastal provinces depended on it for a living. In terms of export value, it even exceeded the export value of China's special product silk and jumped to the fifth place in total export value, making it an important export material for China to earn huge amounts of foreign exchange. Unfortunately, after the victory, due to the high cost of raw materials and labor, and traffic congestion, production was low and exports were even worse. According to industry insiders, the reasons are: (1) The main raw materials are hemp cloth and yarn. Linen cloth has always been supplied by the United Kingdom. However, the United Kingdom will not be able to resume the supply of new hemp cloth until the year after next, and the price has already risen four times compared to before the war. The stocks in Shanghai have also risen eight times compared to pre-war prices. As for the price of yarn, if valued in US dollars, it has also risen seventeen times compared to before the war. Therefore, the prices of both Chinese and foreign raw materials are expensive. (2) Labor costs vary slightly depending on the region. The flower and embroidery industry has always been based in Shantou and Yantai. Now, due to the unstable situation in Yantai, production is difficult. However, labor costs in Shantou are about half the cost in Shanghai. Therefore, Shantou is still maintaining a small amount of production. It is estimated that the monthly production value is about 300 million yuan in legal tender. Labor costs there, if valued in US dollars, have also risen by onefold compared to before the war. However, Shantou has a severe shortage of raw materials, and normal production is not possible. As for Shanghai, labor costs are too expensive and raw materials are also expensive, so production has completely stopped. (3) Traffic congestion. Taking the traffic between the main producing area Shantou and Shanghai as an example, there are very few ships traveling each month, which greatly affects the transportation and sales of products. (4) Losses in exchange. For domestic exchange, only 92 yuan is received in Shantou for every 100 yuan remitted from Shanghai. In terms of foreign exchange, the current official exchange rate of the US dollar is more than double that of the black market for US dollars. The flower and embroidery industry pays for raw materials and labor, which have inflated more than 10,000 times. The foreign exchange earned from the export of finished products must still be sold to the government at the official US dollar exchange rate, which has inflated only 1,000 times. The loss in this is self-evident. For this reason, the export sales of the industry's current products have almost come to a standstill. Before the war, the industry association had a total of more than 150 members, which has now decreased to 113. Therefore, it is hoped that the government and relevant authorities can assist. The people in the industry have put forward two points: (1) It is hoped that the import tax on the industry's raw materials, such as flax cloth and money, can be exempted to reduce the cost of raw materials. (2) After the foreign exchange earned from exports is sold to the government at the official price, it is hoped that the government can subsidize the black market difference to maintain the industry's production costs.

### Commercial Recession: 20 Businesses Closed Last Week

Most are Daily Necessities and Food Stores

The commercial situation in this city did not improve last week. A total of 20 shops and factories closed, for two reasons: (1) Affected by the recession, (2) Oppressed by high-interest loans. The shops that closed include 7 food stores, 10 daily necessities stores, and 3 stores with unclear categories. By date, 1 store closed on the 16th, 5 stores on the 17th, 3 stores on the 18th, 4 stores on the 19th, 4 stores on the 20th, 1 store on the 21st, and 2 stores on the 22nd.

### 5,000 Tons of US Wheat Allocated to Four Major Factories

The long-awaited 25,000 tons of US wheat, the first batch of 8,600 tons of which arrived here from New Orleans on the US ship "Huan Si" last week, is being unloaded into warehouses. This wheat is a UN relief supply, of which 5,000 tons have been borrowed in advance with the consent of the Executive Yuan of the Ministry of Food to supply the city's four major flour mills with flour-making raw materials to meet the city's needs and stabilize prices. The wheat will be allocated to each factory within days. It is heard that the remaining 106,000 tons of US wheat are also on their way to Shanghai, loaded by two US ships, and are expected to arrive this year.

### Hong Kong Lifts Ban on Exports of Coconut Oil, Rubber, Poplin, etc.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 22nd] The Hong Kong government today officially lifted the ban on exports of coconut oil, rubber, poplin, tobacco, etc.

### Taiwan Sugar Corporation Has Ample Stocks: Sugar Sales are Brisk and Prices are High

The end of the year has always been the peak season for sugar sales. Not only have actual sales in this city increased, but also other ports have come to purchase, especially raw sugar. The compensation market for medium sugar on Saturday last week once opened at 150,000 yuan (limit price 130,000 yuan), and the opening price for raw sugar was 141,000 yuan (limit price 110,000 yuan). The Taiwan Sugar Corporation held the 28th allocation meeting on Thursday last week, totaling 55,000 bags, of which 11,000 bags were industrial. The goods can be shipped on schedule this Wednesday. After the goods are shipped, the 29th allocation will continue the next day. It is expected that the original limit price can be maintained at that time. According to the company, the sugar transported from Taiwan to Shanghai by Hezhong Shipping in recent months has been very large. A total of more than 60,000 containers, with a total of more than 600,000 bags (each bag containing 180 catties), are stored around the Huangpu River. It is also learned that from next year, the company and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have agreed that at least 10,000 tons of sugar will be shipped from Taiwan to Shanghai every month.

### Restrictions on US Cotton Imports: The Textile Industry Will Be Affected

A magnate in the hunger cotton textile industry told reporters: The only industry in China that can occupy a place in the world is the cotton textile industry. Among the enemy and puppet industries taken over after this victory, the achievements of the textile industry are the best. Since the Anti-Japanese War in 1939, factories in various industries have been affected and production has decreased day by day. However, the textile industry, which is indispensable for people's clothing, has leapt to become a leading industry. Unfortunately, its operating rights are still controlled by the enemy. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, the losses during the war are large, and people's clothing is lacking and urgently needs to be replenished. Therefore, the need for yarn and cloth is even more pressing. During the war, the government exercised control, and business was restricted. After the victory, the government abolished it, and the textile industry was able to develop freely. In addition, US cotton was low and product prices rose, creating a golden age for the textile industry. But this situation cannot last long. US cotton imports have been restricted, so how can prices remain low in the future? China was originally established on agriculture, but now it relies on foreigners for cotton. The reason is nothing more than that the cost of domestic cotton is higher, and its quality is not as good as US cotton. Therefore, those who grow cotton mostly switch to other crops, so cotton production cannot be increased. However, if US cotton imports decrease day by day, and domestic cotton production is low, then the price of domestic cotton will inevitably be high, and the cost of yarn and cloth will increase, and profits will be reduced. The future of the yarn and weaving industry cannot be guaranteed to always maintain this golden age.

### Discussion by Responsible Person of the China Farmers' Bank Tea Loan Regarding Tea Mortgage Concerns: This Year's Tea Market Decline Makes Tea Loan Repayment Difficult

A reporter spoke with a certain manager of the China Farmers' Bank in charge of tea loans, inquiring about the bank's tea mortgage support for the tea industry and future prospects. The manager stated: The tea loan was issued in response to government orders. This year's tea situation will make it difficult to repay the tea loan. If this case is not resolved quickly within the year, not only will tea merchants be unable to operate due to all their funds being frozen, but next year's tea industry will also wither. Therefore, the government will inevitably take appropriate measures to resolve the tea loan arrears and develop planned projects for future purchases to offset debts, handled by the China Farmers' Bank or the Central Trust Bureau. Currently, the tea mortgage prices are 200,000 yuan per dan for Pingshui tea, 350,000 yuan per dan for Qimen tea, and 280,000 yuan per dan for Tunxi tea, with other prices yet to be determined. The above are all average prices. When tea merchants mortgage, they can allocate loans based on tea quality. This measure greatly facilitates tea merchants. Applications for mortgages exceed 3 billion yuan. There are also self-made tea mortgages totaling 3 billion yuan, with 180,000 yuan per dan for Pingshui tea, 297,500 yuan per dan for Qimen tea, and 238,000 yuan per dan for Tunxi tea. The loans already issued amount to 1.2 billion yuan.

### European and American Economic Policies: Promoting Production and Earning Foreign Exchange

Mr. Qian Tianhe Discusses Impressions from His Inspection of Europe and America

Commodity prices in our country are rising and production is shrinking. The government has taken various measures to stabilize the currency and suppress commodity prices, such as recently revising import and export plans and establishing a Rolling Input Management Committee to increase foreign exchange reserves and stabilize commodity prices, and establishing a Production Loan Review Committee to promote production. Post-war recovery is not unique to our country, as all overseas countries are doing the same. According to Mr. Qian Tianhe, Vice Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, who was dispatched abroad in May of this year to inspect post-war agricultural production and recovery in Europe and America and returned to Shanghai last Wednesday (18th): Post-war recovery countries all prioritize accelerating production and encouraging exports. The United States has strong productivity and suffered less wartime losses than other countries. However, Britain's current policy is to extremely emphasize three items: increased production, sales benefits, and comprehensive planning. The fundamental requirements are to encourage production and its sales scope to prevent products from becoming stagnant, and to increase benefits to strengthen production and sales interest. For example, agricultural product prices are set low to reduce the burden on consumption. Farmers receive subsidies in addition to sales prices. These subsidies come from taxing daily necessities at 5% or 20%, or even luxury goods at 100%, to compensate for it. This prevents agricultural product prices from soaring and threatening people's lives. This is a type of emerging "egalitarian" method. Also, saving clothing and food and exporting surplus materials to foreign countries earns foreign exchange. Currently, British citizens receive 50 to 60 clothing coupons per year from the government. A pair of socks requires one coupon, a tie requires two coupons, and a suit requires 26 coupons. This means that the entire year's income is only enough to exchange for two suits. I, myself, when staying in England, frequently saw gentlemen on the streets wearing clothing from several years ago. The English value repairs and do not feel ashamed. Food is also restricted. Previously, eggs, flour, pork, and ham were all supplied by Denmark. Currently, the British government stipulates one egg per month, reduces bread and replaces it with vegetables. Britain is a fish-producing country and relies mainly on fish, abandoning ham and pork, and even resorting to rabbit meat. Normally, meals cost five shillings, limited to one soup, one dish, and one dessert. At this time of year, the government broadcasts to citizens via radio when purchasing bridges for import, recognizing this as the sound of Christmas approaching. Regarding the currency system, silver subsidiary coins have recently been replaced with nickel coins, and the silver is melted down to repay war debts. Such examples are numerous. Their daily life is half as expensive as in the United States. France, Denmark, etc., are one-third cheaper than England. France's recovery is slower due to political unrest. However, there has been significant progress in construction. Denmark has always been an agricultural country and suffered relatively little during the war. Currently, agricultural development and increased production are truly astonishing, but they are worried about the reduction in exports to England compared to before. In summary, European countries consider production a current priority, and exporting to earn foreign exchange is not to be delayed. Even when seeking raw material imports from other countries is unavoidable, they are changing to countries that are more friendly and closer to them, such as England importing wheat, meat, and eggs, which were previously mainly imported from Denmark, but are now imported from Canada.

### Preferential Treatment for Normal School Students Enlisting in the Military: Shortening Service Period and Issuing Certificates in Advance: Ministry of Education Has Formulated Four Measures and Issued a Circular for Compliance

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The Ministry of Education previously formulated preferential measures for normal school graduates enlisting in the military, stipulating that if the combined total of their service period and military service period reaches two and a half years, it will be considered as fulfilling the service period, and they can pursue further education. The Ministry of Education has recently issued a circular to the education departments of various provinces and cities: For normal school graduates enlisting in the military who have completed two and a half years of service, graduation certificates will be issued half a year in advance to facilitate further education.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Ministry of Education has formulated four measures for preferential treatment of normal school students returning to school after military service and has issued a circular for compliance. The details are as follows: (1) The service period for graduates of normal schools and simplified normal schools is uniformly set at three years. After enlisting in the military, two and a half years can be considered as fulfilling the service period, and the period of military service can be deducted from the service period. However, students who have already received academic preferential treatment under item 2 will still have a service period of three years, which cannot be reduced. (2) Normal school and simplified normal school students who enlist in the military, when returning to school, if their grades are excellent, can be handled in accordance with the Measures for Academic Preferential Treatment of Middle School Students Enlisting in the Military. Those in the first semester of the third year of normal school or the first semester of the fourth year of simplified normal school are allowed to graduate, but the graduation certificate should be issued after the service period is fulfilled, as stipulated. (3) Normal school and simplified normal school students who have completed their service according to item 1 upon discharge from the military can be admitted to normal colleges or normal schools without examination. (4) Those enlisting in the military with teacher qualifications should be handled in accordance with the regulations for youth enlisting in the military with vocational qualifications.

### Municipal Elementary School Teacher Salary Issues: Mayor Wu Awaits a Clear Order from the Central Government to Decide: Private School Association Sends a Letter of Support and Offers Assistance

[Our Newspaper Report] The ninth representative assembly of the Municipal Elementary School Teachers' Association was held yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the Zhabei Elementary School. More than 200 representatives from municipal elementary schools in various districts attended. Three people, Hu Yitian, Shen Shiqiong, and Zhou Muhua, were temporarily elected as the presidium. After the chairman's report, Mayor Wu and Deputy Director Li of the Education Bureau gave speeches.

Mayor's Speech

Mayor Wu briefly stated: All current problems must be calmly awaited. Regarding the elementary school teachers' desire to adjust their salaries, we must wait for the clear order from the central government to adjust the salaries of civil servants before making a decision. Mayor Wu expressed great sympathy for elementary school teachers, saying that we are unfortunately born as Chinese people and even more unfortunately born as Chinese elementary school teachers. The hardship of life is naturally unavoidable, but we must also deeply understand the difficulties of those in power. The government is constantly trying to find solutions for the people. For example, the recently launched industrial loan program, although it is clear that this move may lead to speculation and exploitation by some selfish profit-seekers, was resolutely implemented for the sake of the entire industrial community. As a result, the manipulation of gold and US dollar fluctuations by certain classes is clear evidence. Therefore, elementary school colleagues must understand the hard work of those in power and, even under the most difficult living conditions, hope to stay in their positions and work hard at their jobs.

Answering Questions

After Mayor Wu's speech, the elementary school teachers present raised several questions, which Mayor Wu answered individually as follows:

Question: It is rumored that the salary of elementary school teachers is clearly stipulated by the central government not to exceed the appointed level. Is this reliable?

Answer: I am not sure. If there is indeed such a law and it is considered inappropriate, colleagues can submit a request for amendment to the authorities through legal procedures.

Question: Why are elementary school teachers not included in the relief for winter clothing from the Executive Yuan?

Answer: Because the majority of refugees in this city have not yet received it, elementary school colleagues have not been able to receive it universally.

Question: Regarding the respect-for-teachers fund, why are some suburban municipal schools still unable to receive it?

Answer: This is a budget problem. I guarantee that it can be fully received throughout the city in the near future.

Question: The procedures for receiving [funds] in the past were extremely troublesome.

Answer: We will try to simplify them in the future.

Question: The Municipal Government bureaus adopt a seniority system, with a grade increase each year, while municipal school teachers require four years for a grade increase. It is hoped that this can be shortened.

Answer: A formal document can be prepared requesting this.

Discussion of Proposals

Regarding the five requests proposed by the municipal elementary school teachers, the following discussions were also held during yesterday's meeting: (1) There is currently no way to raise the base salary. (2) The issue of salary adjustment will be discussed after the central government's clear order on adjusting civil servants' salaries arrives. (3) There is no precedent for requesting 500,000 yuan for clothing assistance. (4) As long as there are no special difficulties in the procedures of the Finance Bureau, there should be no problem with requesting that salaries be paid at the beginning of each month. (5) It is currently feared that it will be difficult to collect a teacher's living allowance from next year. The association may first appeal to the Municipal Council and other groups. Another report: The private primary and secondary school association, upon hearing that teachers of municipal schools in this city are demanding that the municipal government make improvements due to the meager treatment, immediately sent a letter expressing their compassion and their willingness to wholeheartedly assist with this emergency appeal, hoping for a satisfactory resolution as soon as possible.

### Preliminary Results of Middle School Student Mandarin Speech Contest Announced Yesterday

[Our Newspaper News] The Shanghai Municipal Middle School Student Mandarin Speech Contest, organized by the Municipal Education Bureau, held preliminary rounds yesterday (22nd) morning starting at 9:00 AM. The high school group was held at the Municipal Gezhi Middle School, and the junior high school group was held at the Municipal Yucai Middle School. Deputy Director Li Ximou, and high school group evaluation committee members Ge Liting, Wei Huanying, Chen Hui, Zheng Jie, Ma Chongfu, Wang Dagang, Tang Songyuan, Liu Xunmu, Zhang Boyin, and Chairman Xie Engao attended.

### Lixin Accounting School Completes New Campus

The Municipal Lixin Accounting School is the only higher education institution in the country that trains accounting professionals. The school was founded in the Republic of China and relocated west during the war in 1937, with branches in Beibei, Sichuan Province, and Chongqing. Last autumn, it returned to Shanghai to restore the school and vigorously expand it. In addition to purchasing the old base on Hongqiao Road (near Xujiahui Station) and building a three-story steel-concrete school building, it has also refreshed the faculty. In the next semester, famous professors such as Li Zhaohuan, Zhang Naiqi, Chen Xianyuan, Wu Benzhong, Wang Guanzheng, Ji Hong, and Xia Yande have all been recruited. The new campus of the school on Hongqiao Road has recently been completed, and it has been decided to move in for classes next semester. The Textile Building and Wanjing Hall are the most magnificent of all the buildings. It is heard that the Pushi Road school building donated by President Pan Xulun will be used to run city classes and accounting vocational training classes next semester to facilitate enrollment for vocational youth in the city.

### Jinghua Cup Pudong Cross-Country Race: Li Yufeng Wins Championship: Wang Zhenglin Finishes First in Exhibition

The Jingye Sports Association, initiated and organized by Yu Weizhen, Chief of the Yangjing Police Branch, held the first Jinghua Cup Pudong cross-country race yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Residents of the Pudong area, young and old, came to watch this unprecedented event, which was one of the most enthusiastic scenes in cross-country races in this city. The details of the competition are divided as follows:

Competition Process

At around 8:30 AM yesterday morning, the area around the Dongchang Road Wharf in Pudong was crowded with people waiting for the start of the race. The race was originally scheduled to start at 9:00 AM, but because the large number of security police participating in the race had not finished their morning exercises, it was temporarily delayed until 10:00 AM. 171 people signed up to participate, and 143 people actually arrived. The famous long-distance runner Dumb Lou Wenzhao I was unable to attend due to illness. In order to increase the competitive interest of the racers, the organizers invited Lean Monkey Wang Zhenglin, the holder of the national record for 10,000 meters, to join in an exhibition. A total of 144 people started. After the opening ceremony was completed by all the staff and racers, the starting order was given, and 288 fleet feet moved towards their respective journeys. Li Yufeng, a new player from the Sixth Regiment, took the lead. When he reached Dongchang Road and crossed the Zhuangjia Bridge, Lü Honggao surged forward and ran shoulder to shoulder with Wang Feng. Wang Zhenglin also suddenly sprinted, breaking away and taking the lead. After crossing Zhuangjia Bridge, passing the Sixth Bridge, and heading towards Pudong Avenue, Wang Zhenglin was already 500 meters ahead of the first-place Li Wangfeng, and Li was 100 meters ahead of the third-place Lü Honggao. When approaching the finish line, with only 1,000 meters left, Lean Monkey worked hard to accelerate, sprinting fiercely amidst the warm applause of the cheering crowd, reaching the finish line first with a time of 31 minutes, 6 seconds, and 2/10ths of a second. Later, Li Wangfeng, Lü Honggao, and others completed the entire course of 98 people. However, the entire course of yesterday's race was estimated to be about 9,200 meters. Wang Zhenglin's result, calculated proportionally, if it were 10,000 meters, it would not be difficult to break his own national record.

### College Soccer Specialty Group: Nantong Wins Against Lixin

In the college soccer league, in a specialty group game yesterday, Nantong played against Lixin Accounting at Fudan University's field. It was cold and windy, and the audience was not crowded. At 2:30 PM, referee Bao Heqing blew the whistle to start the game. Nantong's forwards were particularly active. After ten minutes, Nantong's Yuan Jin kicked a goal from the crowd, giving Nantong a 1-0 lead. In the melee until the 20th minute, Li Kongjin intercepted the ball and shot from 20 yards out, scoring, making it 2-0. Lixin lost another city. Lixin counterattacked, and Nantong's Lu Tong committed a handball foul at the 15-yard mark. Xu Huiyong took the penalty, and the ball floated down, but Yuan Qin was negligent and watched the ball fall into the net, making it 2-1. The first half ended with Nantong in the lead. After the change of sides, the lineups of both sides remained unchanged. In the eighth minute, Lixin's defender Yi Lugen was penalized for a foul, and Li Kongjin took the penalty. The ball shot out like an arrow, hitting the bullseye. Nantong scored another goal, making it 3-1. Nantong attacked again, and Li Shihua and Yuan Jin advanced side by side. The corner kick was excellent, making it 4-1. Lixin was unable to counterattack. A few minutes later, Nantong had a corner kick opportunity. Yang Jinchuan kicked it in, and the landing point was good. Zhou Qianxun rushed forward and kicked, and the ball went into the net, making it 5-1. Qianxun scored twice, making up half a dozen. In the last six minutes, Xu Huiyong made another great contribution, pulling back a goal, making the final score 6-2.

### The United Group Abandons the Match Against Lung Kit, Spectators Dissatisfied and Demand Ticket Refunds, Friendship Match Fails to Finish

[Our Report] In the First Division of the Football League, the Lung Kit versus United Group match, originally scheduled for 2:30 PM yesterday at Jin Yuan Park, with referee Jin Jiabiao. As the appointed time arrived, only eight United Group players, including Qian Changrong, were present. Consequently, they automatically declared their abandonment of the match to the referee. However, the game was changed to a friendly match and continued. As a result, both sides played very lazily, leading to numerous jokes. Over two thousand spectators, who had come to worry and cheer for them, were actually unaware of the situation. Some loudly complained that it was a waste of two thousand yuan to watch such a match. After the first half, the score remained 0-0, with neither side scoring. During the break, over a hundred spectators gathered at the ticket booth demanding refunds, but were unsuccessful. They then rushed into the field, causing the game to stop. Spectators from all around also gathered, surrounding the referee and demanding refunds. Jin Jiabiao immediately stated that this was not within his authority. The crowd then rushed to the ticket booth, shouting slogans such as "Drag them out!" Order was extremely chaotic. Eventually, the Football Committee agreed to issue refunds, totaling approximately six or seven hundred tickets, and the uproar finally subsided.

### The Tentacles of the Northeast Mainland: Lushun & Dalian on the Eve of Takeover

— Shenyang Air Dispatch on the 13th, Our Northeast Special Correspondents Pei Yuanyuan and Han Qingtao

Dalian is the gateway to the Northeast Mainland, a major port by land and sea, an international free port; Lushun is a military choke point, a fortress, a naval port, and a naval base. These two important coastal cities, reaching into the Bohai Gulf, form the tentacles of the Northeast Mainland.

According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Lushun Naval Port would be jointly used by China and the Soviet Union for thirty years. Upon expiration, it would be fully and unconditionally returned to our country. Dalian is an international free trade port. Recently, the central government is about to officially take over the civil administration of Dalian and Lushun. Simultaneously, the National Army has advanced to the boundaries of the Dalian urban area. Consequently, Dalian and Lushun have become a focus of global attention.

After fifty years of exploitation and transformation, Dalian and Lushun have become somewhat estranged from the motherland. However, the compatriots of Dalian and Lushun never forgot that they were Chinese, even in their final moments. Because of their innate Chinese identity, they were consistently discriminated against and driven by the Japanese in the past. Blood, tears, strength, and sweat created the prosperity of Dalian and Lushun, drying up the blood and sweat of the Dalian and Lushun compatriots. Now, one or two generations have passed!

The overturning of a blood-and-tear-soaked history of over fifty years, the vindication of over fifty years of suppression, was placed on the shoulders of the Chinese people after the liberation of the Northeast. But what was the situation in Dalian and Lushun for over a year? What did the compatriots of Dalian and Lushun see? The Chinese people have heard something, or even seen it with their own eyes. Today, everyone unanimously demands clarity and normalization. The government must take over the land and sovereignty, and no division or destruction is permitted!

National Army on the Edge of Dalian

This time, the National Army advanced towards Dalian from the vicinity of Fuxian—also known as Wafangdian. The time was noon on November 24th. The first target was Fuxian City on the China-Changchun Railway, as well as Chengzixu on the Jinzhou-Chengzixu Railway and Piziwo. In this way, they had seized the two "legs" of Dalian and Lushun, slowly advancing forward. From Fuxian to Pulandian is sixty li. By the end of November, Pulandian was also taken over. Pulandian to Shihe is twenty-five li, which is the boundary line of the defense area of the jointly used Lushun Naval Base according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty. At that time, there were still Soviet troops stationed there. In order to avoid misunderstandings, the National Army stopped advancing in the Tangfangtun area.

The National Army on the Jinzhou-Chengzixu Railway advanced along the route, and carried out mopping-up operations in the area between the China-Changchun Railway and the Jinzhou-Chengzixu Railway, marching southwest. Before December 5th, they reached the "crotch" of the two "legs" of Dalian and Lushun, that is, the meeting point of the China-Changchun Railway and the Jinzhou-Chengzixu Railway. The place is called Guangningsi. Then they flashed away from the railway line, operating in the vast area east of the China-Changchun Railway to the coastline. Dashang Mountain was used as a base.

Dashang Mountain, also called Laohu Mountain (Tiger Mountain), is the boundary of Dalian City. This line runs from Dashang Mountain through Heshangtun and Caojiatun, east to the coastline and then to the sea. The entire line is a large arc. From the southwest of Dashang Mountain, it passes through Nanshan and then extends westward, far away to Longwangtang near Lushun, which is the junction of the two cities of Dalian and Lushun.

Dashang Mountain is a high mountain east of Jinzhou. A unit of the National Army advanced southwest along the boundary line of Dalian City from here. South of Jinzhou City, also south of Jinzhou Station where the Jinzhou Civil Affairs Office is located, they crossed the railway. Jinzhou Station is the starting point of the Jinzhou-Chengzixu Railway. The National Army did not enter Jinzhou City or go to Jinzhou Station, but moved in the mountains after passing through Nanshan. A small part reached the vicinity of the Nanguan Railway Station, perhaps the outpost on the right wing of the railway line. At the same time, a small part was active in the Ganjingzi branch line, which can also be said to be the outpost on the left wing. In this way, they had entered the boundary of the Dalian urban area.

This happened around December 5th. It is said that at this time, the National Army discovered Soviet troops and stopped advancing again. This is because the National Army especially took into account the Sino-Soviet friendship and avoided unnecessary misunderstandings, waiting for a diplomatic solution. It is also said that this was to give the Communist Army a chance to withdraw automatically, so as to avoid war and further heavy casualties and destruction. Because the military authorities avoided making any statements about accepting Dalian, the details of the advance may differ from this article, but the reporter has started from many aspects and this is roughly the situation. From now on, we will only see how the Communist Army withdraws from Dalian. The National Army is now waiting at the door.

First Naval Port

Lushun stands at the southernmost tip of the Liaodong Peninsula, embracing the Bohai Sea with Penglai on the Shandong Peninsula, becoming the gateway to the Bohai Sea. It faces the vast sea and is surrounded by large and small mountains. After the management and construction by Imperial Russia and Japan, it has become the first naval port and naval base in North China.

The boundary line of Lushun starts from Longwangtang in the east, passes between Changlingzi and Longtou Station on Lushun Road, and extends through Tuchengzi to the Dachaikou on the northern sea. The main urban area of Lushun is in the southeast corner, and the southwest corner is occupied by mountains. Many villages surround the foot of the mountains. The same is true in the northwest corner. It can also be said that except for the plain area near the west side, the rest of the urban area of Lushun is almost all mountainous.

New City Street is in the west, and Old City Street is in the east, separated by a railway line and the half-cut Long River. Lushun Station is on the east bank of the river, also on the edge of the West Port. New and Old City Streets are connected by two bridges. New City Street has two rivers, and Old City Street has one river. Mountains, water, flowers, houses, and a seaside bathing beach make it a very neat and beautiful place.

The urban plan of Lushun, whether New City Street or Old City Street, is almost in the style of the Tsarist era. A part was added and expanded later, and the total area has reached 6.79 million tsubo. According to statistics: the city has 142,700 people and 324 villages.

There are "Luda South Road" and "Luda North Road" for transportation between Dalian and Lushun. The South Road is a modern highway. This road, about eleven li long along the coastline, is a modern "Tarmacadam-style" highway completed by the Japanese at the cost of 1.35 million yen over three years. The North Road is about fourteen li long, with many oak trees and many villages along the line. Starting from the urban street and driving along the railway line, passing Shuishiying, then through Sanjianbao, Tuchengzi, Yingchengzi, and crossing the Zhoushuizi on the Chang-Da Road to Dalian, it also takes one hour. On the Luda North Road, there is a railway line now called "Lushun Road", which also winds around the mountains and connects with the highway at times, connecting the passenger and freight transportation between Dalian and Lushun, as well as military use.

The "Tiger Tail Peninsula," with a tail-like terrain, constitutes a dangerous naval port. The West Port is wide, and the East Port is a small dock. Regarding the agreement on the Port of Lushun: the protection of the area is entrusted by our country to the allied Soviet Union, and the expenses are borne by the Soviet Union itself. After the expiration of the thirty-year period, all equipment and public property in the area, regardless of whether they are owned by the Soviet Union, will be returned to China unconditionally. Therefore, the current Port of Lushun is stationed and utilized by the Soviet army, which is completely blameless. The future takeover by our government is mainly the civil administration of Lushun. In terms of military equipment, our government will only use it jointly with the allied Soviet Union.

Beautiful City

Dalian is a beautiful city in our country. The green sea surrounds it on three sides, east, north, and south. Cherry blossoms planted by the Japanese bloom all over the mountains and fields in spring, dazzlingly beautiful!

The Pier District and Xigangzi are bustling commercial areas. The gardens and seaside bathing beaches of Xinggepu are picturesque. The industrial area of Shahekou is also very famous. A steel factory has more than 100,000 workers.

Dalian is a crossroads of Eurasian transportation. After arriving at Dalian by sea and disembarking, it takes ten days to reach Moscow to the north and west, and twelve days to reach Berlin. The sea distance to Shanghai is 544 nautical miles to the south, and to Hong Kong 1225 nautical miles. The sea distance to Osaka is 867 nautical miles to the east. In addition, it is 177 nautical miles to Yingkou and 157 nautical miles to Andong.

Dalian Port facilities: The waterways in the bay maintain a water depth of about 10 meters at high tide. The wharves include breakwaters about 5 kilometers long. The water area inside the dikes is 950,000 tsubo. There are also piers about 100 meters wide projecting into the water inside the dikes. Such long protruding dikes, extending 6 kilometers, can accommodate 40 ships of 5,000 tons to be berthed in the port, and large ships of 20,000 tons or less can be berthed arbitrarily.

The area inside the wharf is about 750,000 tsubo, which is filled in artificially. On the four main piers, there are four railway lines, and trains carrying 1,000 tons of cargo can come and go continuously. Along the coast, there are two- or three-story concrete warehouses. The passenger pier has a reception center that can accommodate 10,000 passengers. The internal facilities are fully equipped. There is a radio broadcasting studio on the roof of this building to guide ships at sea.

In the city center, there is a Central Plaza with a small park, city hall, court, bank, hotel, chamber of commerce, post office, consulate. On the circumference, eight main roads radiate in all directions from this central area. The residential area at the foot of Nanshan is full of Western-style buildings, exquisite and beautiful.

The water supply and drainage equipment in Dalian City is a noteworthy project. This large project uses the natural sloping terrain. All garbage, snow, feces, and other items flow into the entrance and can flow for thousands of miles, spitting into the sea. Due to the lack of rainfall and dry land, high reservoirs of about 20 meters and a depth of three or four kilometers were built in Wangjiatun outside the city and in the Longwangtang mountains near Lushun. Water is fed into the city's water supply pool through a 30-kilometer-long water pipe, which is sufficient for 1.5 million citizens to use.

According to a survey on May 18, 1940, the city's population was approximately 590,857, including 175,483 Japanese. There are two types of "National Schools" and "Public Schools" in the city. National Schools educate Japanese children, providing elementary education facilities. Public Schools educate our Chinese children. According to a survey in 1944, there are 37 National Schools with more than 24,000 students. There are 143 Public Schools with 85,000 students. There are four middle schools run by the government and one run by the public, with more than 5,000 students. There are a total of five higher girls' schools run by the government, public, and private sectors, with 6,600 students. There is one higher public school each in Lushun and Jinzhou. Although education can be said to be quite developed, it contains many toxins inside.

Dalian-Lushun Border

Traveling from Dalian to Lushun, starting by car from Dalian, you first pass through the scenic area of "Xinggepu," followed by the coastal amusement park, Heishijiao, Xiaoping Island, and Laozuotan Road. Continuing forward, you reach Longwangtang, the border between Dalian and Lushun, which is a large water source. The green shade blocks the road, the water source is clear, and the scenery is tranquil. Approaching Lushun, after passing through the Baiyinshan Tunnel, looking at the seaside bathing beach, you have arrived in Lushun. You can take a train or car on the North Road. The time for both the North and South Roads, plus the train line, is almost one hour.

The Japanese boast that this is a "capital of Eastern culture," and also a commercial port that ranks second among the five major commercial ports in terms of trade volume. Everything shows a new and active atmosphere. However, in its shadow, there are other cruel demons harming and exploiting our compatriots!

Regarding the Sino-Soviet agreement on the Port of Dalian: the interests of the Soviet Union in this free port are: first, to implement military control over Dalian during the war against Japan; second, to rent half of the wharves, warehouses, and all port facilities without debt during peacetime; and third, Soviet goods are exempt from import and export duties. The administrative power of Dalian belongs entirely to our country, and the peacetime military security also belongs entirely to our country. Therefore, when our government takes over Dalian in the future, it will take over all the property and rights of Dalian and sublease a part to the Soviet Union.

The Japanese ruled Lushun and Dalian for fifty years, plundering the blood and sweat of the Northeast compatriots. In terms of material construction, there have been great achievements. A paradise built of blood, flesh, and tears has been destroyed, broken, and has changed its face, suffering great sacrifices. After fifty years, what will Dalian and Lushun be like tomorrow!

Weekly Forum

### On Large-Scale Industrial Organizations

— Jian Guansan

The development of modern industrial organizations in the West has progressed through the following stages: First, small-scale factories were established one after another, causing family industries to lose their original position; later, large-scale industries rose up, and small-scale factories were either eliminated by technology or merged by large enterprises, leading to a situation of intense competition. As this situation evolved, the so-called "trusts," "cartels," and "concerns" arose, confronting each other like large armies.

The mergers of enterprises can be roughly divided into two categories: The first is the loosely organized "agreement of interests," such as "cartels" and "syndicates." Those who join this agreement only act together in accordance with the provisions of the contract, and their original independent character is not lost, as if one country and another country, although forming a military alliance, are still independent countries in terms of sovereignty. The second category is the tightly organized "enterprise merger," such as "trusts" and "concerns." Those who participate in this type of organization dissolve their original units and form a larger business combination, as if several small countries merge into a large country, and their respective independence is lost.

Whether it is an "agreement of interests" or an "enterprise merger," if they operate in the same type of industry, this is called "horizontal integration" or "integration of the same kind"; otherwise, it is called vertical integration or "integration of different kinds." The latter is more in-depth and more advantageous than the former. Japan’s Ishihama Tomoyuki said, "The monopoly system only showed its initial signs before 1860, and its major development was in the early 1890s. The 'cartel' was no longer in its youth, but in its adulthood. All raw material industries, mining industries, and metallurgical industries gradually tended to 'cartelization,' reaching the stage of monopoly."

If we point out the disadvantages of these large organizations, such as excessive greed, too fierce monopoly, manipulation of the market, and control of the economy, these are the most obvious facts. But since it is the most important organization in modern society, it certainly has its advantages: First, it has strong capital and can use the latest machines to promote industrial development. Second, it uses the latest technology to engage in mass production, and the manufactured goods are naturally cheap and of good quality. Third, because it is a large and well-organized organization, it is easier for the government to control. For example, it is much easier to control a few large steamship companies or trusts than to control many wooden boats. During the Anti-Japanese War, the reason why it was difficult to control prices in our country was, from the perspective of rent, because the economic units of agricultural society were too dispersed and the combination of new-style industries and commerce lacked a system, making it difficult to achieve effective control.

Germany can be said to be a relatively backward country in the history of the Industrial Revolution, but the reason why its industry was able to develop rapidly and surpass others is that it paid attention to large-scale organizations as soon as it launched the Industrial Revolution, which was not an unimportant reason.

Britain was originally a more stable country in industry, but when World War I broke out, due to the urgency of the war, it had to devote itself to "enterprise concentration" and further expand the organization of "trusts" and "cartels." After the war, in order to save the economic decline, it still devoted itself to this direction, such as the Lancashire Textile Industry Association, the Coal Industry Association, and the Lancashire Steel Industry Association, all of which are large and powerful organizations with strong capital.

Britain is blessed with unique conditions and a very suitable environment. In terms of industrial organization, it is particularly easy to develop in a large-scale direction. This trend can be roughly divided into two stages, namely, the 19th century was a period of expansion of production scale, and the 20th century was a period of centralized management of enterprises. Such centralized large organizations, such as Roma Fuel's Mobil Oil Trust, Morgan's Steel Trust, and Ford's Automotive Concern, are the most prestigious internationally.

China is now still hesitating between the old family-style industrial organizations and small-scale new enterprise organizations, far from the situation in the West in the 18th and 19th centuries. No wonder our country, on the one hand, has great difficulty in wartime management, and on the other hand, has insufficient equal production. Specifically speaking about factories, not only are there few in number, but also small in scale.

The company organization is the organization that is most capable of developing in a large direction in modern industry; but why is it easy to develop in a large direction and become a newer combination of modern industry? First, it is a legal person with its own independent and stable character. Second, it can gather many fragmented capitals together and generate great effects. Third, most of them are limited liability companies, bearing limited liability, and will not affect the assets of each shareholder outside the share capital due to the company's bankruptcy. Fourth, it has a shareholders' meeting, a board of directors, and a supervisory committee, which is somewhat similar to the style of modern democratic politics.

As for partnership and sole proprietorship organizations, they lack the advantages of a company and still seem to carry the atmosphere of the family industry era; not only are they too rigid, but also their scope is narrow, making it difficult to adapt to the needs of this era of large industries. The rapid development of modern Western industry from partnership and sole proprietorship to company organization has indeed been of great help. Chinese people are used to living in families in agricultural society, and their economic relations are often limited to families and local parties. They naturally do not trust such company organizations that use broad economic relations as ties and ignore them. The difficulty in establishing Chinese companies is undoubtedly significantly influenced by this psychological factor.

Even if they are reluctantly established, because people who have been immersed in agricultural society for a long time lack organizational concepts, some are willful, some are indifferent, and it is difficult to proceed smoothly and maintain them for a long time. Many industrial organizations in China are difficult to establish and quick to disappear; psychologically speaking, this is the feudal consciousness left over from agricultural society that is playing a trick. After industry develops, these consciousnesses will gradually disappear.

Speaking of this, some people may think that "once large-scale industrial organizations develop, they may violate the original intention of restraining capital." I believe that since the country's finance and transportation are all within the power of the central government, and all monopolistic industries have been determined to be within the scope of state-owned enterprises, then no matter which large-scale private industry, there is no need to worry that its hegemony will form an "economic warlordism." Such "warlordism" is likely to grow only in Europe and the United States, where private capital overwhelms national capital, but it is difficult to have its existence in the New China of the Three Principles of the People. Moreover, the means of restraining capital have different degrees of urgency in the early, middle, and late stages. Why should we give it severe restrictions in the early stages of infancy, causing the industry to fail to develop together? When the industry develops to the middle stage and seems to have a considerable scale, the state will naturally use progressive methods to levy temporary capital taxes, inheritance taxes, and excess profit taxes for financial or national defense reasons; and formulate disaster compensation laws, labor insurance laws, labor dispute settlement laws, and labor welfare fund-raising laws; directly seeking benefits for laborers and indirectly reducing the prestige of industrialists using capital and organization. When the industry is at its most developed stage, large enterprises have a monopoly and affect the welfare of the masses, the state will then take compulsory measures to nationalize them to achieve the goal of public enjoyment, which is not too late. The leaders of the British Labor Party have said: "It is actually harmless for factories to merge into large organizations. Because large organizations are easy to nationalize after a certain period." According to the Father of the Nation's views in the Industrial Plan, it is enough to prove that large-scale industrial organizations are the result of economic evolution, and finally, state-owned methods can be used to adjust and cure their own disadvantages. He said: "Large companies can save waste and produce cheap goods, which private individuals cannot achieve. Whenever and wherever there is a large company established, it will sweep away other small manufacturing industries and supply society with cheap goods, which is certainly a convenience for society. But unfortunately, large companies are mostly privately owned, and their purpose is to obtain more profits. After all small manufacturing industries are overwhelmed by them, they increase the value of each item because of competition, and the society is actually subjected to invisible oppression. The emergence of large companies is the result of economic evolution, which cannot be subdued by human power. If you want to save its ills, you can only organize all large companies and nationalize them by the people of the whole country."

The so-called "large-scale industrial organization" (large companies are only one of them) is the result of economic evolution, and its disadvantages can be adjusted and cured by the power of doctrine or planned economy. Why should our industrially young country be afraid and give up eating, fearing the disadvantages? We do not develop a capitalist system because we are concerned about its monopoly disadvantages, not even erasing its "large-scale organization." The so-called People's Livelihood or Socialist society is to promote and expand large-scale organizations to adapt to the "socialization" of production, not to abolish it, decentralize it, and return to a narrow economic system. Therefore, the large-scale organization of capitalist society is actually the foundation for establishing the People's Livelihood Principle. Without this foundation, just wanting to realize the People's Livelihood Principle on the ruins of small farmers or handicrafts is nothing more than a golden dream.

Looking at the increasing situation of state-owned enterprises in our country, even if private industrial organizations are allowed to develop in a large direction, they will not be too big to fail and create an "economic warlordism." In short, in the future, China's industrial management will focus on a planned economy and hold the central keys. Then, private industries can be allowed to develop as much as possible, so that both the public and private sectors can jointly devote themselves to industrial construction.

Therefore, state-owned industries must actively proceed in a large-scale direction, and private industries should also be encouraged to strive towards the same large-scale direction. Otherwise, hesitating and being caught in a dilemma, I am afraid that they will always stagnate halfway without the hope of rapid success.

### The Japanese Textile Industry After World War II

— Deng Shaoqiu

Japan's textile industry was so developed before the war that it competed with Britain in the international market. In the fifteen years before the war, its speed of improvement and the effectiveness of its efforts were unmatched by any other country in the world. Its ambition to lead the world's textile industry was gradually turning from an ideal into a reality. However, good times don't last. This time, due to a moment of misjudgment, the warlords initiated the war of aggression against China, leading to the stagnation of various industries, with the textile factories suffering the most. The losses caused by the US Air Force's bombing during the war were enormous. However, since its unconditional surrender last year, it has been fully supported by the United States, coupled with its excellent national character, and is now gradually resuming operations. According to recent surveys, the completeness of equipment and the speed and precision of production in Japanese textile factories are astonishing. After our country's victory, we continue to do things our own way, being selfish and self-serving, and not seeking improvement, so the future is worrying. The current situation and advantages of Japanese textile factories are described below for the study of our textile industry and the vigilance of government authorities.

Although Japan's textile factories suffered considerable machine damage and economic losses in this war, the spirit of cooperation and the impetus for accelerated reorganization have gradually improved the situation in most cases. Among various industries, textiles still occupy a relatively advantageous position, and the reform of its equipment and the progress of its work are truly beyond expectations.

Silk The recovering Japanese textile industry is planning to revive its once world-renowned silk weaving industry on a large scale. There are two purposes: one is to export it in exchange for food, and the other is to supplement the shortage of domestic textiles. The Japanese silk weaving industry's five-year plan proposes to set up committees in the silk-producing areas and subcommittees in secondary areas to supervise silk production and control the allocation of mulberry trees and fertilizers. Currently, more than 50 million new mulberry trees have been planted nationwide. There are also plans to formulate a three-year plan for the production of Japanese rayon. Although the current monthly rayon production in Japan is only 20% of the pre-war level, this is because only 13% of Japan's rayon factories are currently operating due to a lack of coal or machinery. However, if these problems can be solved in a short period of time, the goal of the Japanese rayon three-year plan is to produce 60,000,000 pounds of rayon in 1947, and to increase it to 100,000,000 pounds in 1948. As for Japanese silk staple fiber, due to the shortage of various raw materials during the war, the protection and expansion has been significant. Currently, the number of workers is only 15% of the total national production. However, if the plan is implemented properly, the production of silk staple fiber in 1947 and 1948 will each be 60,000,000 and 100,000,000 pounds. Since Japan itself can only consume 11,800 pounds at most, the rest will inevitably be exported to the United States, China, Mexico, and other pre-war markets.

Cotton According to the investigation by the international textile inspection team to Japan jointly released by the US State Department and the Department of the Army in August 1946, Japan's cotton textile industry has installed 2,150,000 new spindles, of which 1,115,000 are usable. It is estimated that if the stored machine parts can be used and the damaged machine parts can be repaired, 3,228,500 spindles can be installed by January 1947. If repairs continue, the number of spindles will increase after January 1947. Japan originally estimated that it would need to import 225,000 tons of cotton in 1946 to make up for the shortage of domestic production, but recently Japan has been able to be self-sufficient. If cotton supplies continue in 1947, its inventory will be sufficient for at least two months of consumption. By the end of November next year, there will often be 144 million pounds of cotton yarn available for export. This year, in addition to 11.1 million pounds of cotton yarn and 900,000 pounds of cotton fabrics, Japan's cotton textile industry is expected to have 35,000 square yards of cotton cloth ready for export. At the same time, the US government's Commodities Credit Corporation will supply Japan with 890,000 bales of cotton this year, of which 185,384 bales have been shipped, and this cotton will be woven into cotton cloth for export.

Wool The recovery of Japan's woolen textile industry is also very stable. According to manufacturers in the industry, if the supply of raw materials is not difficult, they will be able to produce 25 million pounds of woolen yarn and 35 million pounds of blended wool and silk yarn within the next December. However, recently, no woolen raw materials have been imported, and the existing ones are not enough for the national industry to use for a month, so woolen products cannot be supplied for export at present.

The four major textile industries in Japan (including cotton spinning, rayon, raw silk, and wool) account for 75% to 85% of all new machinery industries in the country. Their capacity is sufficient to increase looms by 11,300 and spindles by 290,000 in 1946 respectively. By 1947, production spindles can reach 785,000 and looms can reach 16,800. They can fully restore the pre-war situation!

From this series of news reports and investigations, we can see how actively Japan's textile industry is recovering after the war. Looking back at our textile industry, although the government has taken over many assets this time, it does not use them well. It also harbors the hope of asking Japan's textile industry to compensate for our country's war losses, but the reality is not as convenient as we imagined. Chinese textile industry people, you can wake up too.

### Implementation of Standardization

— Xue Peng

Standard Tools

Although American factories are generally the most vigorous advocates of standardized products, their standardization of tools used in their factories is very backward. This situation is especially obvious in general iron factories. For example, we often see a group of lathes with the same size and function, but manufactured by more than one factory, and the methods of construction are also very different. Some have a lead screw with threads per inch, some have four threads per inch, and some have five threads per inch. Some gear teeth are multiples of ten, while others are multiples of twelve. These inconsistent variations are of course due to competition and the influence of artistic development. These machines of the same size but with different structural characteristics are not important to factories engaged in general and repair work. When the work needs to be designed in advance, this situation is greatly unfavorable. For example, if all machines are the same size and the structure is also the same, it will definitely be much simpler to prepare guidance cards. This need for standardization, if it causes general manufacturers to also adopt one or two standard characteristics for the same products, is not surprising. Maintaining a standard environment is also a necessary condition for standard work. What we said above, that textile factories must maintain a standard climate and humidity in order to get the best work, is a special case that illustrates this principle. This principle can be applied to any industry. For example, automatic machinery is impersonal. When it is working, it cannot get standard actions without setting up a standard time environment. Now, if the belt is loose or the tool is blunt, we certainly cannot expect it to have good results, just like when these elements meet the standard environment. If the human element also needs to be included, then the influence of this relationship will be even more severe, because human beings are more sensitive to the environment than machines. For example, a worker cannot engage in precise measurements with frozen fingers. Most workers are afraid to do familiar work in unfamiliar environments. Now, if machines of the same size and form and workers with the same skills continue to manufacture the same products, then after they are made, the cost of each finished product, if carefully compared, we will definitely see significant differences, although the reason for the difference is difficult to say for sure. This fact can illustrate the impact of the environment on work. Therefore, even if we admit that there are differences in the efforts of workers under normal circumstances, if we carefully study the work environment, the nature of the tools, and other identical elements, the difference in cost can be greatly reduced.

Durability of Standards

This point seems very important. We have already said above that standardization has a tendency to crystallize manufacturing methods and procedures, thereby hindering the progress of industry. Therefore, the selection of standards should be very cautious. Even the standardization of tools mentioned in the previous section may hinder the progress of the industry, although there are considerable benefits at the same time. However, we should distinguish between standards with universal functions, such as weights and measures, and standards specifically used in a certain industry. The standard design, standard methods, standard tools, and standard environment we are talking about here are just the most suitable methods for engaging in a certain work at a certain time. If there are better methods in the future, this quasi-standard can still be changed.

Standardization and Individuality

Almost everyone agrees on the value and need for standardized products with strict uses. For example, standardized plows, telephone receivers, railway sleeping cars, automobiles, and floor tiles are probably not opposed by anyone. However, some people are always suspicious of standardization, fearing that this system will go too far and even affect people's artistic life. For example, thoughtful people are always unwilling to see standardized houses, even in factory towns. For the same reason, probably no one agrees with the extreme standardization or simplification of things such as windows, doors, building bricks, furniture, etc. Although architects do not oppose the standardization of concealed wiring ducts, light bulb sockets, and light bulbs, etc., he always hopes that the lampshades protruding from the walls will come from his artistic design. In addition, many similar proofs can be cited. In our country today, when the Anti-Japanese War has been won, industrial construction is very important, and it seems that standardization should be studied and implemented on a daily basis.

### Introduction to Business Administration

— Xu Baiyi

(4) The Problem of Unemployment

Among the unemployed, there can be divided into two types: one is people who are unwilling to work, and the other is people who are unemployed because there is no work to do.

Many goods cannot be permanently employed due to seasonal reasons. For example, those who specialize in making things for Christmas cannot permanently employ workers. If there is such a situation, then we can think from two aspects: the worker and the enterprise organization. On the worker's side, in order to adapt to the environment, they can find two jobs, doing one job in one period and another job in another period. It is not easy to get the ideal effect using this method, because the two periods may not be coincidental. On the enterprise organization side, if it originally only makes winter products, then it may as well make a summer product. This method can produce the following benefits:

A. Regular expenses can be averaged monthly.

B. Skilled workers can work with peace of mind throughout the year.

C. Other staff members can also have something to do regularly.

This is an enterprise management issue. Any competent authority that can think about the future of the enterprise will definitely be able to think of this method.

But sometimes, the market will encounter a downturn. The creation of the downturn has the following three steps:

A. At that time, the industry and commerce were very developed. Everyone had an optimistic attitude. The production volume increased greatly, and the banks were willing to lend money. Whether it was in the manufacturing process or the finished goods, they could be mortgaged.

B. But the merchants found that they had too many goods in stock (because they exceeded the limit and imported a large quantity of goods. Of course, they could not be sold out as scheduled), so they stopped selling. As a result, the manufacturing plants had to reduce production. Even if the wages of the workers were not reduced, they could not be increased. The purchasing power gradually weakened. Because the purchasing power was weak, the merchants' goods were even slower to find a way out, so they reduced the purchase again, and the assault factory produced even less.

C. But the workers' savings were completely used up, and they had to accept lower wages (it is better than having no work to do in the end). Gradually, they began to buy goods. The merchants saw that the sales of goods were improving, so they ordered from the manufacturing plants. The production volume of the manufacturing plants gradually increased, and the wages of the workers also increased, repeatedly reaching a prosperous period.

This can explain the origin of the downturn and the steps from the downturn to the boom. To avoid the occurrence of a downturn, it should be carried out from two aspects.

1. Manufacturers should not produce excessive quantities of goods.

2. Workers should not demand excessively high wages. 3. Because the manufacturing plants suddenly increased production, it would cause overproduction and sluggish sales. If the workers increased wages, then the cost of the goods would have to increase, affecting the sales of the goods, and it would also be enough to make the sales of the goods sluggish. After the sales of the goods are sluggish, the market cannot flow smoothly, and it will gradually embark on the road of a downturn.

Spring and Autumn

### Remembering Li Qingya

— Fu Jun

Around the years of the Republic of China 16 and 17, I remember being enchanted by Mr. Li Qingya's "Collection of Short Stories by Maupassant" during my middle school days. His fluent writing style was truly unique among the stiff and obscure translations of that time. Of course, we admired Mr. Lu Xun the most at that time, but reading his "Symbol of Melancholy" and "Worker Sui Huiluefu" and other works was a bit difficult, and even made us feel tired. Of course, my personal literary appreciation ability may not be up to par, and it is inevitable that I am too naive to rashly evaluate this literary pioneer; but at that time, no one would be critical of our eagerness for Western literary works, whether creative or theoretical, right? Seeing Mr. Qingya's fluent and refreshing translation style, I truly felt as happy as if I had suddenly discovered that I had arrived at my destination after a long journey!

After growing up, I never thought that I would have the opportunity to become an auditor of Mr. Qingya's lectures. At this time, I formally met him, and I felt a little disappointed. Because when we continued to read his articles, with his fluent writing style, coupled with Maupassant's beautiful and realistic content, we always thought in our ideals that Mr. Qingya was a dashing figure with long hair, a large tie, and a suave demeanor. And it was the first time we met, and the lovely shadow that had been kept for nearly ten years was destroyed like a bubble in an instant. It turned out that he had a bloated middle-sized figure, a plain flat top haircut, a gray cloth gown, cloth shoes, and a pair of reading glasses... When lecturing, his eyes were turned to the sky, and he did not pay attention to the students' movements at all. Slow speech and neat calligraphy were his characteristics. However, his criticism of many writers in the literary world at that time was quite severe. Although it was inevitably a bit excessive at times, it was mostly appropriate.

Mr. Qingya should be the first person to systematically introduce Maupassant's novels! I hope that Mr. Qingya will further promote French literature based on the introduction of Maupassant's works, so that the Chinese people can have a clearer face of French literature.

### Scattered Chapters Before the Window

— Hu Mu

(1) Window

Tightly closing the paper window, I don't want to hear the city's traffic...people's voices...the sound of mud.

I want to think quietly, why are they so busy; window, oh the decoration of my life!

I imagine how good it would be to have no windows.

So that my eyes can see his eyes, so that my soul can approach the soul.

So, we all start to sing songs, singing songs of life!

Talking about the past and the present, so that there is no more loneliness and boredom in life.

(2) Morning

I get up earliest in the morning.

I like to recognize and look at the bright morning, the splendid clouds of dawn, listen to the joyful and unrestrained sound of the river, and the birds also hold grand concerts at this time.

I get up earliest, I don't like coal smoke, I don't like the turbid air in the city.

I don't like sound sleep even more.

Get up early. Because, I love dawn, I love sunshine.

(3) Door

Open the door, the sound of people and sunlight are flooding outside...

Outside the door, flowers are blooming with bright petals, and the green fields have just finished their night's dream.

Workers are all from the ribs of cattle window, there is still a line of weak bean oil light left, they get up, so, cart drivers, porters, washerwomen, rickshaw pullers... are all walking on the road of dawn.

I also comb my messy hair, put on a loosened red tie, and go out with the book version under my arm.

Go to paint the wilderness after a deep sleep, the awakened appearance.

(3) Sunshine

The weather with sunshine.

On everyone's face, a smile of youth is painted, and everyone's heart is full of grateful love.

The weather with sunshine. In the wilderness, there is a green field, the tawny thatched cottage, and a wisp of green smoke is rising from the roof, the small river is flowing excitedly, and the birds are calling more beautifully.

I breathe in the fragrance of the sunshine. So, I opened the snow-covered doors and windows, clapped my hands, jumped a little, welcomed the sunshine, welcomed the sunshine of life, come in!

So, I re-organized my boxes, and re-organized my youth.……

The dry breath of sunshine, made my heart full of green moss, and was resurrected again.

(4) Land

The land nourishes mankind. I am a child of the countryside, I should be proud to the city people, I should also thank the mother's land, I ask the children of the city, "Where does rice come from"?

The land is paved for us to cultivate.

For the sake of life, we should shed a sweat to the land, to the soil of our life. But, sometimes when layers and layers are pressed on the land.

In my heart, there is a cold confession, and a sad humming of winter songs.

(5) Shepherd

Every day, when I open the window, I look.

Spring, summer, autumn... he is on the back of the cow, gently driving the cow with a small, tender willow branch: from his smiling face, I can see that his eyes are still full of crystal tears.

Life, torturing him, has a back that cannot be stretched up!

The shepherd rides the cow and walks through the green forest. I only hear the remaining sad sound of the flute!

### Answering Mr. Boying's Poem Showing Him and His Friends Drinking Together

— Zhang Shijian

I don't mind the early years of white hair invading, but I am happy in middle age with a moral heart; words enter into love like the sea, and poetry flows to repay the interest like Tinglin. Doctors must originally blame old faults, and when the arguments are in full swing, they will benefit the present; why should I use clay to think of retreating, and the old raincoat and shoes can be found again.

### Poems of Xuan Yin Lu

— Pan Boying

During the years of the Republic of China twenty-two and three, Zhang Jun Yaoxiang and Cao Jun Liwu and I were neighbors in Zhenru Town, Shanghai. After the Japanese surrendered, we met and drank with Liwu at Xiang Lao's Golden Valley Village residence.

The children of different times are all courteous, checking and watching the white hair new; beyond expectations, the Golden Valley wine for ten years, in front of the lamp, nine deaths for the brown-clothed man, fighting sand used to come and go with the tide, changing the world still labors with arm bending and stretching, and it is suitable to give you a close game, and don't refuse to visit frequently.

The old friend's generous salary cut off the sound, and the old pivot opened the door and still recognized Yu; it is difficult to forget the feelings in the prosperous world, and the dramatic talk is happy and then develops into a Xuanqu; the feelings are somewhat light with clams, and the plans are sparse between the wild geese; raise the white wine and float the son Caozi first, this evening's flavor is like Zhenru.

Occasionally used

Jibei Liaodong is full of war, and Jiangnan is building a new house; I was surprised to hear that the Yan Han Dynasty was fishing for mutton wheat, and I remembered identifying the besieged city jade-faced man; the morning fog is cold and many flowers are about to bloom, and the virtual window sleeps beautifully with the feet first stretched, the dream is sparse and the court is paid tribute, and the Jun Tian Yan is not envious of being frequent.

Digging Clay

The old friend's strange festival has been high for a long time, and the four seas are still traveling; looking up to A Heng as the holy assistant, why does digging clay escape from people;

How can you sleep with your hands and get three dukes, and Xiaozhan actually retreated from the wind; the man of Shaoshi Mountain is not asking for a price, even if he does not come out, he will be empty.

### Portrait of Mrs. Cad

— Ingres

Ingres (1780-1867) was a representative writer of classicism in France in the early 19th century. He and Dai Lak窃 were students of Da Zu, but his views were exactly the opposite of Dai's, and he tried his best to promote the restoration of the Italian painting tradition. The wind is cold and clear, and the picture emphasizes decorative beauty. He is one of the leading representative writers in the French art world. The sketch lines are beautiful, lively and sure. This picture is now in the Louvre in Paris, and the French regard it as a national treasure. (Lion)

Brief History of Musicians

### Beethoven

— Tian

A German, who often lived in Vienna, and was known as one of the "Vienna Three Masters" along with Haydn and Mozart. The progress of Western instrumental music reached the stage of Beethoven and reached its peak. Beethoven's life was full of love tragicomedies. By the time he wrote his Ninth Symphony, he was deaf in both ears, and later he was troubled by illness and had frequent troubles. Beethoven wrote this song in all kinds of grief and indignation, and it became a timeless masterpiece.

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood 130

— Ye Jingfeng

Both types of activities, whether supporting Konoe or opposing him, were obstacles to Tsurumi's work. From all indications, if Tsurumi wanted to get his hands on the secret of the "Seven Secret Letters," he had to break through these seven layers of defenses first. Moreover, due to various concerns, he couldn't engage in a grand and open struggle but could only proceed with covert designs.

Tsurumi's car sped for five or six hours, reaching the suburbs of Tokyo and entering the Yasusaka Chicken Farm. The owner of this chicken farm had studied abroad for many years, believed in liberalism, and was extremely anti-war. Within the Tsurumi group, he was "Number 07." In society, besides raising chickens, he also had a sign as a silent doctor but never practiced medicine. Now over fifty, he was exempt from military service. His chicken farm, though covering over fifty acres, had less than four chickens per acre because he emphasized studying bloodlines, chicken breeds, and the theory of chicken farming, not profiting.

This Yasusaka chicken farm invariably receives two visits from patrolmen each month. Ostensibly, it's to protect the chicken farm from petty thieves from outside the city who might come to steal and damage his business, but actually, it's because the political authorities consider him a "liberal" with unstable thoughts. The government has his record on the "blacklist," fearing his activities, so they frequently come to warn him. Logically, one or two warnings every one or two months should suffice, but why so frequent? This is due to the chicken farm owner being overly hospitable. Every time the patrolmen came, he always arranged fine food and drinks to treat them. The patrolmen, considering it official business, only wet their lips, feeling they weren't compromising their integrity, so they felt at ease. Initially, they came once every two months, and each time, it was only one person. After some time, seeing the owner's generous offerings, they called their friends and colleagues to come and feast. Feeling that two months was too long, they changed it to once a month and then cleverly created reasons to change it to twice a month. Each time, at least four people came.

Yasusaka, on the other hand, was happy. After spending a few dollars on food and drink, he got some benefits in return. First, the people in the surrounding countryside, seeing the patrolmen associating with him, thought he had influence and were very respectful to him. Second, since the patrolmen started visiting, petty thieves had disappeared, not daring to cause trouble. Third, and most importantly, his covert activities were not only not exposed but were even protected because, as the saying goes, "A person who receives favors is soft-handed, and a person who eats is soft-mouthed." The patrolmen, having eaten his food, always gave him a report of "being law-abiding and focusing on academic theory."

Since Yasusaka joined Tsurumi's work, his chicken farm became the main base of "Zero"-designated personnel in Beijing. Although they never held large meetings, small group discussions were always held there, making it a natural small group meeting place. They only needed to avoid the half-day when the patrolmen came for a free meal to be completely safe. Moreover, Yasusaka could manipulate this half-day at will. Just make a phone call, saying that the food and drinks weren't prepared that day and rescheduling, which was more effective than plague repellent. Even the five plague envoys of the emperor would certainly give way.

From Konoe's perspective alone, his villa in Beppu must have secret police patrolling day and night. Moreover, the Black Dragon Society and the Heavenly Lineage Society would naturally send people to guard and protect Konoe's safety. The most formidable were the German Fifth Column; they placed great importance on Konoe's personal safety because, due to their secret alliance, protecting Konoe was equivalent to protecting Hitler. As for how formidable these fellows were, one only had to see the tactics used against Tsurumi the night before to understand.

In addition to the above-mentioned two layers in the open and three layers in the dark, totaling five layers of defense, there were several more layers of unpredictable obstacles. Although these obstacles had complex reasons, they could be broadly categorized into two types: one type was emerging groups hoping to curry favor, so they sent secret agents to operate in the area, hoping to find some scraps of information to ingratiate themselves. The other type was secret organizations opposing Konoe personally or opposing the policies of Konoe's faction. They also had people infiltrate this guarded area to gather information on Konoe's actions as a basis for opposing or attacking him.

### Conscription

— Shao Fu

Conscription work has already begun. The first step is to investigate eligible young men. According to the commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, the so-called eligible young men, according to the Military Service Law, are those from the age of twenty-one to twenty-five. If the number is insufficient, they will be supplemented in order.

We have always had the popular saying, "Good people don't join the army." Frankly speaking, this saying has harmed our country for hundreds of years. We have also suffered greatly from this saying during the eight years of the war of resistance. We are gradually correcting this erroneous notion. Now that the war of resistance has been won, everything is premised on nation-building, and conscription is also a peacetime recruitment and training, which should not cause some people to worry excessively!

People in any country in the world have served in the military. Good people join the army, only bad people evade military service, and such people are often despised by society.

If a counter-question is raised: Why don't you good people join the army? Because you good people don't join the army, which further exacerbates this bad phenomenon! Wouldn't those who evade military service be ashamed and have no place to hide?

Recently, I watched a movie: "Sergeant York" (translated as "God Gunner" in Shanghai). I have previously read a novel: "Higher Than Everything." I believe that anyone who has seen this movie and read this novel will be moved. Because Americans and British can be proud, and everyone has fulfilled their sacred duty to their country.

Various Anecdotes

### Democratic Palace Former White House Butler's Report

— Mengdie translated from the December issue of Woman's Home Companion

The following questions about life in the White House are answered by Henrietta Nesbitt, the former White House butler, in response to questions from the American people in the "Family Companion" magazine (Woman's Home Companion). Nesbitt served in the White House for thirteen years and has recently left office.

1. Is daily life in the White House very restrained and restricted?

Answer: Life is certainly more restrained than in ordinary homes. For example, those guests who come to play poker with Truman, or to chat with Mrs. Truman, or to date Margeret (the President's daughter) must stop outside the White House gate and be checked by the Secret Service protecting the President. Then they walk to the front porch, where a dignified host leads them upstairs. But on the floor above the official reception room, which is the President's family residence, it is the same as an ordinary American home—not restrained.

Molotov is the most difficult to serve

2. Who is the most difficult guest to serve in the White House?

Answer: It is Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, because we must be extremely careful to protect him. For example, when he is in his room, all the servants must leave that floor, and the servants are only allowed to go up to work after he goes downstairs. Molotov indeed made our work more difficult. In 1942, I thought this caution was superfluous. Because in wartime, with the protection of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, even a mouse could not run into the White House to threaten him.

3. Does every guest in the White House live comfortably?

Answer: Yes. The guest rooms are very large and comfortable. Each room has a radio and the latest magazines. Guests eat breakfast in bed; they can play tennis on the White House lawn and swim in the pool. They do not have to abide by strict rules or rituals, so they are free to do what they like. What the guests are most honored about is that they can visit the White House. Who wouldn't want to sleep in Lincoln's bed and tell their family or relatives in the future?

4. Do White House guests take souvenirs?

White House guests take things without asking

Answer: Yes. In my thirteen years of service, I simply cannot estimate how many spoons have gone missing. Many linen towels have also disappeared in the bathrooms, so I had to repurchase them. After I posted prohibition signs, that part of the items was no longer taken as souvenirs. But one day, when the White House was opened to the public for visits, we found that the lace of our best red satin curtains in the East Room had been cut off by the crowd.

5. Are the beds in the White House comfortable?

Answer: When I first went to sleep in them, I thought they were comfortable, but Roosevelt's children had slept in them for many years, and they said the beds were not good, the springs were broken, and the pillows were hard. After I re-softened the mattresses, the families of Roosevelt and Truman, as well as Democrats and Republicans, and officials from various countries did not say the beds were uncomfortable.

6. How is the life of Roosevelt's grandchildren, Hopkins' daughter Diana, and the princes and princesses who sought refuge from the Netherlands and Norway?

Answer: They rarely have children of the same age to play with, and they are always watched by nannies and officials, so life is very uninteresting.

Only on Palm Sunday in 1943 was their happiest day, because that day Washington City had an unseasonable heavy snowfall. The children slipped away from their nannies, took two large aluminum trays from the kitchen, and skied on the sloping lawn of the White House.

The children sometimes had pillow fights on President Roosevelt's bed, and Roosevelt watched and judged them. Roosevelt was never happier than on the day of his fourth presidential inauguration, when all fourteen of his grandchildren came.

White House dogs enjoy themselves

7. Are the dogs in the White House as restricted as the children?

Answer: No, they are much happier than the children. Truman's family does not keep dogs; but Roosevelt's family has never been without a dog. The American people all know about the happy life of Roosevelt's Scottish dog, Fala. The second famous dog in the White House is a French poodle, Suzie. It was brought by Mrs. Hopkins when she got married. It is small and gentle, but it always eats on the carpet.

8. Are the food in the White House bought in bulk or retail? Are they delivered by phone or bought at the market?

Answer: All methods are used. I buy canned beans and potatoes in bulk by phone, but I also go to farms near Virginia and Maryland to buy fresh vegetables.

Simple menu

During the war, all the food in the White House was transported by a special Secret Service car, inspected in the food laboratory of the Department of Agriculture, and then sent to the White House kitchen.

9. Is the daily menu in the White House extravagant?

Answer: The menu is as follows:

Clear soup Roast platter Fragrant bamboo shoots French fried potatoes Waldorf salad (cold dish) Bavarian chocolate ice cream Coffee

10. The menu for entertaining guests in the White House:

Clam Cocktail Beef soup

Turtle Corn bread

Boneless capon Jam Peas

Butter beets Sweet potatoes

Cheese watercress cold dish White cake

Almond ice cream Coffee

### On the Phone

— Cai Xue

This is the Q&A on the phone:

"Is Mr. Zhao Jianan here?"

"Not yet."

"Will he be here soon?"

"Maybe."

"Well, after he arrives, please ask him to give me a call."

"I'm afraid that's impossible."

"Who are you?"

"Universal Funeral Home!"

### Official Price and Market Price, Everyone is Happy

— Shi

Gold is rising step by step, and prices are following suit. The end of the year is approaching, which is "joy for some and sorrow for others"!

Gold has a distinction between "official price" and "market price." The official price is the "rationed price," and the market price is the black market price. To crack down on the "black market" to save people's livelihood? Therefore, in the past, "official price rationing" was implemented. Now, the "official price" is also like a rabbit race, following behind the "black market" at a "rapid pace"!

Therefore, today's gold is truly "official price and market price," "everyone is happy"! Buddha said: "Excellent, excellent!"

### Minister Yu Hongjun, Who Came from a Reporter Background

— Inguo

Yu Hongjun's history in the political arena is not long, but his development has been faster than anyone else's, starting from the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, then Acting Mayor, then Vice Minister of Finance, and to today's Minister of Finance.

He is from Guangdong and graduated from St. John's University, so he speaks English very fluently. Before he stepped onto the political stage, he was a reporter for the Shanghai English newspaper, the Da Mei Evening News. In terms of personality and talent, he met all the conditions that a reporter should have. He is lively, resourceful, good at socializing and activities, and especially good at verbal responses, which gave him even greater help. If he had continued to walk the path of a reporter, he could have become a famous reporter and occupied a position in the Chinese news industry, but he finally embarked on the path of politics.

When the "August 13th" battle broke out, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng was appointed Chairman of Guangdong Province, and the Acting Mayor was Yu Hongjun, who was then Secretary-General. When the National Army withdrew to the west, Yu went to Hong Kong. Due to helping Kong Lingkan, the representative of the "Central Trust Company" in Hong Kong at the time, with business shortcomings, he was valued by Kong Xiangxi, who was then the "Minister of Finance," and was appointed Vice Minister. After Kong retired from the political stage, the "Minister of Finance" was Yu, and he remains so to this day.

He has a very forthright temperament and has absolutely no so-called "official airs." Precisely because he came from a reporter background, his attitude towards journalists is satisfactory, answering all questions. If he has time, he often chats with reporters in the office. When he chats happily, he will unreservedly put his feet and legs high up on the desk, leaning back in the swivel chair, almost falling down. Then, the reporter can also sit on his desk and continue talking to him.

During the "August 13th" Shanghai war, when Yu was Acting Mayor and hosting reporters, a reporter asked him about the location of the artillery shells fired by our army. Yu replied with a smile: "I didn't go out with the artillery shells." From this "ingenious answer," one can know a little about Yu's ability to deal with journalists.
