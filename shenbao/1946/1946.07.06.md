### Unconfirmed Report of General Marshall's Imminent Return to the US; Five-Person Talks to Continue Today; Both Sides to Present Concrete Proposals

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] The five-person negotiation committee, temporarily formed by representatives of the government and the Chinese Communist Party, spent the entire day today discussing all post-war issues in the Communist-controlled areas within and outside the Shanhaiguan Pass. It is said that both sides have agreed to resume the meeting at 4 PM tomorrow. According to neutral sources, the representatives of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will present more concrete proposals on various issues tomorrow for discussion.

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] The current Kuomintang-Communist negotiations have encountered new difficulties due to the scheduled convocation of the National Assembly. The CCP insists that the National Assembly be decided by the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), and considers it more important than the administrative authority over Northern Jiangsu. The government, on the other hand, believes that it should proceed step by step according to established policies.

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] Direct Kuomintang-Communist negotiations are underway, with both sides studying the situation separately today. However, it is rumored that both sides still adhere to their original positions, with no new ideas. Zhou Enlai visited General Marshall at 5:30 PM today and returned around 7 PM. The conversation covered the content of yesterday's meeting and the issue of convening the National Assembly, which was reported to General Marshall.

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] It is confirmed that US Special Envoy to China, General Marshall, will not return to the US at this time because his mission is not yet complete. The reports carried by a few newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai a few days ago that General Marshall intended to return to the US in the short term are absolutely inaccurate.

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] General Marshall told our reporter that regarding the foreign press reports that he intended to return to the US in the short term, he had not yet made such a decision himself. Judging from this, the so-called news of General Marshall being weary of his mission is indeed baseless. Furthermore, our reporter learned that whether General Marshall can go to Beiping in the short term has not yet been determined. However, if the direct negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party achieve success on issues related to the ceasefire and military reorganization, then General Marshall, to alleviate the suffering of the Chinese people, would not hesitate to embark on a long journey despite the summer heat and could go to North China and the Northeast at any time.

[United Press, Nanjing, 4th] Special Envoy Marshall has been in China for half a year. How long will he stay? This question has become a shadow over the difficult peace negotiations. To date, the only answer is that Special Envoy Marshall cannot stay in China indefinitely. Most observers today believe that the road to lasting peace in China is still long, no different from when Special Envoy Marshall first arrived in Chongqing. The government has announced that the National Assembly will be convened on November 12th of this year. Unless an agreement is reached before this date, the CCP may once again refuse to participate. If Special Envoy Marshall returns home early, the difficulty of selecting a suitable successor becomes another practical problem. Former US military commander in China, General Wedemeyer, is about to return to China. Considering his understanding of China, he is fully qualified to continue the mission, but in reality, the CCP may not be satisfied with him. Special Envoy Marshall's entourage has not hinted at any slight discouragement from Special Envoy Marshall regarding the promotion of peace in China, nor has General Marshall's prestige among the CCP leaders or the National Government leaders diminished. Those assisting Special Envoy Marshall in the negotiations believe that there is still a glimmer of hope for peace, and that Special Envoy Marshall should remain in office to complete his mission.

[United Press, Nanjing, 5th] Representatives of the Democratic League, Luo Longji and Liang Shuming, visited Wu Tiecheng today, advocating that the PCC Comprehensive Group should hold a meeting immediately to resolve various outstanding issues. Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu are scheduled to hold a third meeting with Chen Cheng, Shao Lizi, and Wang Shijie tomorrow to discuss the issue of the National Assembly. Zhou Enlai's wife, Deng Yingchao, went to Shanghai today for a short stay.

[United Press, Nanjing, 5th] A senior Kuomintang official stated today that regarding the troop reorganization issue, the government hopes to reach an agreement with the Communist side within a week or ten days. However, this does not imply that the government is setting a deadline for resolving the issue.

### National Assembly Representatives Remaining in Nanjing Issue Declaration: People Expect Government Relief; Kuomintang-Communist Issue Needs Urgent Resolution

[United Press, Nanjing, 5th] The National Assembly Representatives Remaining in Nanjing Committee issued a declaration today stating: There should be a deadline for ceasefire and peace negotiations. The government should not adopt a non-aggression attitude as before the Sino-Japanese War, holding to the principle of "I will not offend others unless offended." The current situation is different from the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War. At that time, China rose up to "resist" because Japan invaded Chinese territory. Today, the Communist Party occupies a vast amount of land throughout the country. If both sides adopt a non-aggression attitude, does this mean that the government has recognized the Communist Party's occupied territories? The government stated in its June 30th ceasefire declaration that it hoped Special Envoy Marshall would continue to mediate to seek a peaceful resolution. But we should remember that Special Envoy Marshall's mediation has been going on for half a year, and peace is still not in sight. We must ask the government, how long will the negotiations continue? There are millions of refugees in China today, and the people under Communist rule are suffering even more. The people now expect the government to provide relief, just as infants look up to their mothers. The government not only fails to aid the people but also engages in slow negotiations. Does the government know that for every hour spent in negotiations, many innocent people die tragically? The three demands put forward by the government, such as permanently ending initial battles, restoring transportation, and reorganizing the military, have not been resolved during the five-day ceasefire period and the extended ceasefire period. Although the government has ordered that they must be resolved, there has been no concrete solution to date, nor has there been an agreement in principle. If the government is not very confident in its demands, it should not speak so strongly. Please make the negotiation process public and announce your future attitude so that the people can decide who is right and who is wrong. Democratic countries have no secret diplomacy. Should we have secret diplomacy in our internal affairs?

According to Hong, the preparatory work had been planned or completed early due to the importance of convening the assembly on May 5th. During the extended period, the preparatory committee, due to the possibility of the assembly being convened at any time, had tightened all work separately but had not stopped.

[This City News] He Yingqin, head of the Chinese delegation to the Military Staff Committee of the United Nations Security Council and head of the Chinese military delegation to the United States, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the special "Triumph" train on the night of the 4th. When interviewed by the Central News Agency reporter yesterday, he said that people all over the world are now eager to realize lasting peace. China, as a peace-loving country, is very willing to work together with countries such as the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France to promote world peace. Since everyone is mentally unprepared for war, there is no reason for war to occur. Therefore, I am very optimistic about the international situation. Speaking of domestic problems, He said: The government has consistently advocated resolving all problems through political means. As long as everyone truly puts the interests of the nation and the country first, any matter can be peacefully resolved. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek over the past eight years, we have completed the victory of the War of Resistance. In the future, we should devote all our efforts to construction and accelerate the work of rehabilitation. When the reporter asked He how the country's military education should be improved in the future, he said: To build a modern country, it is necessary to have a modern army and modern military education. It is necessary to develop industry, transportation, and all aspects of construction in a coordinated manner. Only by "enriching the country and strengthening the army" can we truly achieve "national wealth and military strength." Regarding the construction of the Northeast, He said that based on his observations, although the Northeast had been occupied for fourteen years, most of its industrial base had not been completely destroyed. If it is no longer damaged and the people of the country work together, it will only take seven years to achieve the initial ideal of revitalizing the Northeast and building the Northeast. Finally, He told the reporter affirmatively that if the people of the country are truly united and work together, China and the world will surely realize lasting peace. He is currently in Shanghai processing出国手续出国手 and will fly to New York to take office as soon as the seat is allocated. If he has any spare time before departure, he will hold a press conference.

### Communist Troops Cross Pinghan Railway and Advance Westward; Fierce Fighting in Yingshan, Northern Hubei; Attempt to Attack Xiangfan, Tongbai and Zaozao in Separate Routes

[Our Beiping Office, 5th] Official news: After the Communist troops of Li Xiannian withdrew from the Guangshan area, they are planning to cross the Pinghan Railway and advance northwest. Judging from the situation, this move is intended to entrench themselves in the Funiu Mountains and cross the Yellow River north. On the other hand, the Liu Bocheng troops in northern Henan have also launched a large-scale offensive, advancing into counties such as Xiangwu, Wuzhi, and Xiuwu, in order to meet up with the Li Xiannian troops heading north. Another part of the Li Xiannian troops is heading north via northern Henan and northern Shandong, with the intention of merging with the Communist troops in southern Shandong. The Communist side's explanation for this is that these Communist troops were defeated by the National Army and dispersed.

[Our Beiping Office, 5th] Responsible persons of relevant agencies told reporters that the Military Mediation Department, in view of the large-scale movement of Communist troops in the Guangshan area recently, which has caused fierce conflicts, has ordered the Communist troops in that area to be driven out of the defense zone and not allowed to move again.

### Introducing International Trade Plans, Conclusions Reached at Yesterday's Meeting

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Planning Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs held its eighth meeting on the morning of the 5th, chaired by Xiao Zheng. The main topic of discussion was "Improving International Trade Plans." The conclusions reached were: (1) China's foreign trade should adopt planned free trade; (2) Tariff rates for imports should be differentiated based on their importance, and restrictions should be imposed through means other than tariffs. Export tariff rates should be reduced as much as possible; (3) Foreign exchange management should coordinate imports and exports proportionally, and foreign trade organizations should be strengthened to provide guidance. The Bureau of Commodity Inspection should be reorganized into a state-owned enterprise. In the afternoon, at the ninth meeting, chaired by Wang Yunwu, the original topic of discussion was "Review of Economic Laws and Economic Administration." However, due to the many days of meetings, most committee members felt that the general issues had not been fully explored and opinions were not fully expressed. Therefore, the original topic was reserved for post-conference written opinions from committee members. This final meeting was still devoted to general discussion. Committee members spoke one after another, adding many insightful supplements to the various issues discussed over the past four days. The atmosphere at the meeting this morning was exceptionally harmonious, and the committee members shared a consensus on various points for developing international trade. During the meeting, Huang Yuanbin, An Shukang, Zhuang Zhihuan, Wu Qiyuan, Xu Jiqing, Ji Naiqi, and others discussed with particular enthusiasm the rational restrictions on imports, the encouragement of exports, and the competition for the Southeast Asian market. Pan Zheng, representing the Ministry of Finance, also offered explanations regarding the prevalence of smuggling. Jin Shixuan, representing the Ministry of Communications, explained that the high freight costs for current exports were mainly due to loading and unloading fees, rather than normal transportation fees. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM. At the afternoon meeting, speakers included committee members such as Hu Juewen, Hu Qian'ang, Zhang Naiqi, Li Junlong, Cui Weiwo, Li Zhuchen, and Wu Yunshu. Some committee members reiterated that the enemy and puppet factories and mines should be restored quickly or returned to their original owners, and that the current situation should be investigated. However, some committee members pointed out that in light of the current economic crisis, considering China's situation over the past century, it was already possible to embark on the path of development. Finally, after reviewing the issue of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which was soon to resume operations, the meeting adjourned.

### More Than Ten Million Military and Civilians Died During the Eight-Year War of Resistance; News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense Compiles Illustrated History of the War of Resistance

As for the military and civilians who died throughout the country, it was difficult to obtain accurate statistics at the time (even in the city of Nanjing alone, the number reached over 300,000). It was only known that 3.5 million soldiers who died in action had been reported on record. Therefore, the total number of military and civilians who died throughout the country must be over ten million. Deng also stated that President Chiang Kai-shek might personally preside over the memorial service for military and civilians who died in the capital. The News Bureau is currently compiling an illustrated history of the War of Resistance, which will soon be published.

### Jiangsu High Court Orders Arrest of Traitor Bei Jinzhang; Traitor Qin Mianjun's Sentence Reduced to Ten Years of Imprisonment

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 5th] Traitor Bei Jinzhang, former Director of the Pig Tax Bureau of the Puppet Jiangsu Province and chief comprador of the Japanese-owned Dada Jing Company and Sakoda Trading Company, was originally a notorious gangster in Suzhou.

### The New Administration of Xinjiang

The newly appointed members of the Xinjiang Provincial Government were sworn into office in Dihua on the first of this month. President Yu Youren of the Supervisory Yuan, specially dispatched by the Central Government to oversee the oath-taking ceremony, expressed great hope for the future Xinjiang Provincial Government. Mr. Yu stated that the future Xinjiang government is a democratic government, and there will no longer be friction between ethnic groups. The people of Xinjiang will forever be free from the suffering of darkness, war, and lack of freedom. According to reports, the oath was divided into two versions: Chairman Zhang Zhizhong led the recitation of the oath in Chinese, and Vice Chairman Akhmetjan Qasimi led the recitation of the oath in Uyghur. The holding of this oath-taking ceremony represents the implementation of the new administration in Xinjiang, which is a landmark measure with profound significance. As the delegates to the National Assembly from Xinjiang come to Shanghai, we would like to express our expectations for the future of Xinjiang.

The establishment of Xinjiang Province dates back to the Qing Dynasty. At that time, after a period of chaos, Governor-General Zuo Zongtang, who was in charge of the administration, was quite talented and resourceful, determined to govern, and all policies began to take shape. Zuo's policy of governing Xinjiang did not ask whether one was Han or Hui, but only whether one was causing chaos. The significance of this lay in eliminating hatred among the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, which was an enlightened ethnic policy. The residents of Xinjiang were originally extremely diverse, including local Han Chinese, local Han Hui, and native Chan Hui, also known as the Uyghur people, or the Uyghur people of the Yuan Dynasty, the Huihe people of the Tang Dynasty. In addition, there were also nomadic Mongols, Tatars, Kazakhs, Uzbeks, Kyrgyz, Tash people, etc. With so many ethnic groups living in one area, disputes were naturally likely to arise. After the Xinhai Revolution, due to Xinjiang's location on the frontier and the central government's inability to reach it, the administration of Xinjiang gradually formed a situation of local separatist warlord rule. During this period, disturbances occurred repeatedly, the most famous being the Rebellion in Southern Xinjiang, and as recently as the Yining Incident. Since the disputes that occurred in Yining in July of the 33rd year of the Republic, the situation gradually escalated, and for a time, there were rumors of organizing a "Republic of East Turkestan." In September of last year, the Central Government specially dispatched General Zhang Zhizhong to Xinjiang to handle the disputes, and then appointed Mr. Zhang as the Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, repeatedly holding consultations with representatives from Yining. On January 2nd of this year, the main text of the Reconciliation Terms for the Yining Dispute, consisting of eleven articles, was signed in Dihua. At the same time, an appendix was established, and on June 6th of this year, a second appendix was established. After being approved by the Central Government, it was announced in Nanjing on the 29th of last month. With this, the Xinjiang issue was completely resolved.

Based on the Reconciliation Terms and appendices, the Xinjiang Provincial Government immediately underwent reorganization. In order to coordinate the border people and stabilize the border regions, the Xinjiang Provincial Government implemented an expanded organization, with representatives from various ethnic groups participating. In addition to Chairman Zhang Zhizhong, who also serves as the Director of the Northwest Headquarters, there are also two vice chairmen, Bao Erhan of the Tatar ethnic group and Akhmetjan Qasimi of the Uyghur ethnic group. There is also one secretary-general, Liu Mengchun of Guangdong, and two deputy secretaries-general, Salisi of the Kazakh ethnic group and Abdulkerim Abbasov of the Uyghur ethnic group. In addition, there are 19 committee members, appointed by people from the Han, Han Hui, Uyghur, Mongol Banner, Kazakh, Uzbek, and Kyrgyz ethnic groups. Among them, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs is Han Chinese, with one Deputy Director being Uyghur; the Director of the Department of Finance is Han Chinese, with one Deputy Director being Han Hui; the Director of the Department of Education is Uyghur, with one Deputy Director being Han Chinese; the Director of the Department of Construction is Uyghur, with one Deputy Director being Han Chinese; the Director of the Department of Social Affairs is Han Chinese, with the Deputy Director belonging to the Mongol Banner; the Director of the Department of Health is Kazakh, with no Deputy Director; the Mayor of Dihua is concurrently held by a Han member of the provincial government. It can be seen that after this reorganization, all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have participated in the government. The Reconciliation Terms and appendices also stipulate that all ethnic groups have the right to autonomous elections, that the government should eliminate religious discrimination, granting the people complete freedom to believe in their religion, that government agency documents should be written in both Chinese and Hui languages, that people may use their own languages independently, that schools may use their own languages for teaching, but Chinese should be a required subject in middle schools, that the government should ensure the free development of ethnic culture and art, and that armed forces of various ethnic groups who participated in the incident should be allowed to be reorganized into three infantry regiments and three cavalry regiments, with two cavalry regiments and one infantry regiment being national troops and the rest being local security forces.

After this reorganization, Xinjiang has entered a new era, characterized by the realization of freedom and equality for all ethnic groups. This is a clear example of the government and the people starting anew. In the past, the reason why disputes arose frequently in Xinjiang was that the various ethnic groups distrusted each other, and those in charge of the administration were often unable to take into account the feelings of the various ethnic groups and properly mediate, leading to major changes due to minor causes. Now, the government is handling border affairs based on the Three Principles of the People of the revolution, using them to harmonize all ethnic groups, so that the Xinjiang issue can be completely and satisfactorily resolved. The principle of nationalism in the Three Principles of the People originally had two aspects, internal and external. The internal aspect seeks freedom and equality for the Chinese nation, while the external aspect seeks freedom and equality for the various ethnic groups that make up the Chinese nation. Based on this spirit, the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, held in Chongqing this March, made important decisions on border affairs, reaffirming the government's enlightened ethnic policy. This newspaper published an article on March 21st commenting that the border policy decided by the Second Plenary Session was not only sufficient to show concern for compatriots in the border regions but also opened up a broad avenue for their future development. Now that we have seen the new atmosphere in Xinjiang, we are even more reminded that the truth of nationalism is inherently indestructible. As long as it is sincerely implemented, any complex problem can be solved.

The implementation of this new administration, based on the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session and the instructions of the Chairman, demonstrates the government's determination to protect the autonomous rights of all ethnic groups in the border regions. This is an example of political democratization and the nationalization of the military. In the future, with the new administration unfolded, with all ethnic groups working together in freedom and equality, not only can past suspicions and jealousies be eliminated, but they will also be able to move forward with sincerity and solidarity, strengthening our borders, under the belief of mutual assistance, cooperation, benevolence, and peace. How to improve politics, utilize resources, develop transportation, and strengthen the relationship between the border provinces and the interior to build a new Xinjiang, we believe that under the coordinated guidance of Chairman Zhang and the committee members of various ethnic groups, it will be actively unfolded. We especially admire General Zhang Zhizhong's repeated efforts to mediate the Xinjiang issue, working hard for the country. The new administration of Xinjiang has begun. We hope that this spirit of harmony and coordination can build a new Xinjiang and further extend this spirit of coordination to the whole country, building a new China!

When Okada Keisuke of China rose to testify, the American prosecutor, Sackett, submitted excerpts from the defendant Hashimoto's book "Advice to Young People" as documentary evidence, stating that it was sufficient to prove that the defendant Hashimoto had planned the Northeast Incident, destroyed the international disarmament treaty, and planned various conspiracies domestically. Then, Yamanaka Ryukichi, the former Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, testified. Tanaka stated directly as follows: "At that time, Commander of the Kwantung Army, General Honjo, and Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Saito, were not involved. The planner of the incident was then Senior Staff Officer of the Kwantung Army, Colonel Kawamoto Daisaku. At that time, in response to the Tanaka Cabinet's proactive policy on the Northeast issue, he planned to disarm Zhang Zuolin's vehicle in the west of Jinzhou, who was retreating from the Pingjin area. The purpose was to force Zhang Zuolin to step down, make Zhang Xueliang the master of the Northeast, separate from the Nanjing government, and make the Northeast not only peaceful but also under Japanese control. However, this plan was strictly prohibited by the Tanaka Cabinet, but Kawamoto still wanted to achieve the goal of supporting Zhang Xueliang, so he blew up the train carrying Zhang Zuolin on June 3, 1927. The bombers were one officer, one non-commissioned officer, and soldiers from the engineering regiment dispatched from Keijo, Korea, to the Northeast at that time."

Military Rampancy

According to Kido's diary, on the day the September 18th Incident occurred, he, then Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Makino Nobuaki, Minister of the Imperial Household Iki Kitokuro, and others discussed the Shenyang Incident. That night, he received a phone call from Harada, the secretary of Duke Saionji, who said that Saionji instructed him to pay attention to the incident of the Japanese army in Korea invading the Northeast without the permission of the Emperor. On September 19, Prime Minister Wakatsuki met with the Emperor and said, "The policy is to prevent the situation from expanding further, and to stop as soon as our army gains a superior position." That night, Harada told him, "I met the Prime Minister today, and he said that the military's attitude is very tough, and the matters decided by the cabinet cannot reach the frontline troops, which is quite troubling. He talked about whether there is a good way to control the military, and intends to ask Prince Kan'in to work hard, or to invite the elders to come to the capital." On November 14, he met with Yasui Masaatsu, Yoshida Shigeru, and Arima Fumio to review the current situation. Yasui said that the military's actions have become increasingly active recently, and more and more vagrant students are also participating, so it is urgent to study countermeasures. On November 15, Director of Military Affairs Bureau Hayashi said: "If the resolution of the Northeast issue is delayed for a long time, it will also be inappropriate in terms of the military's control regulations, so there are preparations to establish a new regime in the Northeast," implying the military's attempt to establish a puppet regime in the Northeast.

### German War Crimes Should Be; Hitler's Responsibility; Defense Lawyers' Closing Arguments

[Reuters, Nuremberg, 4th] Dr. Jerell, a non-Nazi international legal expert and defense attorney for the German war criminals, defended the defendants in the war crimes tribunal today, saying that the crimes of which the defendants are accused should be the responsibility of Hitler alone. They were only acting collectively on Hitler's orders. The "Leader Principle" was the law of Germany under Hitler, and according to international law, if Germany attacked a country with which it had a non-aggression treaty, only the German state was guilty of a crime, and individuals could not be accused of crimes, even if that person was the leader of the state.

### After the City Government Implemented Rationing; Rice Black Market Still Rampant; Citizens Should Pay Attention to Four Points! If Rice Shops Have No Rice to Sell, They Can Immediately Request to See the Account Books for Inspection

The city's rice supply is increasing daily. Rice from various places has been transported in large quantities. Large quantities of Jiangxi rice and Vietnamese rice have begun to be fully distributed to rice shops by the Social Affairs Bureau to meet the needs of the citizens. Yesterday, 7,000 bags of Vietnamese rice (about 9,000 piculs) were distributed and sold by various rice shops, while the city's daily sales are still less than this number (daily sales of about 5,000 piculs). Therefore, the supply is very sufficient, and rice shops should no longer have a shortage of rice to sell. Starting today, 5,000 piculs of Jiangxi rice will be distributed, and in the future, rice will continue to be shipped in and distributed in proportion to actual needs. The China National Food Corporation is currently working hard to purchase foreign rice to regulate the people's food supply. It is reported that large quantities of Siamese and Brazilian rice will arrive in Shanghai in succession. However, the rice black market is still very rampant. Some rice shops are selling the rice allocated by the government on the black market to obtain huge profits. The city government and the Social Affairs Bureau have dispatched personnel to conduct strict investigations. From today onwards, citizens are urged to pay attention to the following items when purchasing rice: (1) When going to a rice shop to buy rice, pay attention to whether various types of rice are marked with the place of origin, quality, and price. (2) If the rice shop has no rice for sale, you can ask the rice shop to show the account books to check the quantity allocated to it, and the invoice stubs of who it was sold to. (3) If citizens find that the rice shop does not mark the place of origin, quality, and price for the rice it sells, or refuses to sell rice, they can report the facts to the city government or the Social Affairs Bureau. (4) If the rice shop only sells at black market prices, citizens should also report the matter to the city government or the Social Affairs Bureau after purchasing the rice.

In addition, Mayor Wu stated at a meeting of foreign reporters yesterday regarding the city's food problem: If Shanghai's rice supply cannot be handled well, the entire city will have problems. The city government will conduct a large-scale investigation of the relief books of various rice shops. If it is discovered that they are selling on the black market, they will be severely punished. The Jiangxi rice distributed yesterday was brown rice, and the allocation price per picul has been reduced to 42,000 yuan, which is 4,000 yuan cheaper than before. When rice shops sell it, they can add 6%, legal profit, and freight, so the price per picul is about 46,000 to 47,000 yuan. Therefore, this can also lower the city's rice prices, and brown rice is rich in vitamins.

Dividing themselves among three freight trucks plastered with slogans, they paraded around the city from morning until dusk and petitioned the External Affairs Office in Shanghai, requesting a postponement of the repatriation of the factory's German brewmaster, Oppenheimer.

Mr. Oppenheimer joined the factory in 1936. Whether there are other reasons for this matter is currently unknown.

### Dr. Hu Shih Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday, Bringing a Large Volume of the "History of Chinese Thought"; After Nine Years of Separation, Chatting and Laughing; Wishing to Teach More in the Future

[Our News] Dr. Hu Shih, the former Chinese Ambassador to the United States, after embarking on the Taft Presidential liner in New York on June 5th of this year to return to the country, arrived at the Wusongkou in this city at around 10:00 AM yesterday. Zhang Fuyun, the Customs Commissioner, specially sent a small tugboat to welcome him. When the bell of the Jianghai Customs sounded nine times, amidst the lights of thousands of homes, Mr. Hu was finally seen carrying multiple boxes of manuscripts and books brought from the United States, stepping onto the Haihong Wharf. He immediately took a car to the seventeenth floor of the Broadway Mansion for temporary residence.

The reporter immediately visited Mr. Hu at his temporary residence. Mr. Hu flew from Hong Kong to the United States on September 20th, 1937, and it has been nine years in the blink of an eye. This time, he has returned gracefully, his temples already showing some gray, but his face is fuller than before, and his spirit is exceptionally vigorous. Mr. Hu was wearing a blue-gray summer suit, with a blue-based white-dotted thin tie. He still wore his familiar tortoiseshell glasses on the bridge of his nose, chatting and laughing with the visiting relatives and friends, still exuding the demeanor of a refined scholar.

Mr. Hu said to the reporter with a smile: "For the past three and a half years, I have rarely left the house, burying myself in the study of historical research. I have compiled the materials from my lectures at Harvard and Columbia Universities into a large volume of the 'History of Chinese Thought.' Therefore, I have rarely heard about foreign affairs, and because I have been separated from my homeland for many years, I also feel unfamiliar with the domestic situation."

Mr. Hu said: "The American government and people have great expectations for me, hoping that my country will have a bright future after the war." When the reporter asked Mr. Hu about his thoughts on his homeland, Mr. Hu replied: "My country has suffered an unprecedented blow from this national crisis, and I also deeply hope that my country will have a bright future!"

Recently, the National Government announced the appointment of Mr. Hu as the President of National Peking University. When the reporter inquired about this with Mr. Hu, Mr. Hu said that he did not know the details. However, he earnestly told the reporter: "In the future, it would be best to teach more and not be involved in administrative matters."

When Mr. Hu went to the United States in 1937, he initially had the mission of a "cultural ambassador," engaging in liaison work with leaders in the American cultural and educational circles. The following year, he assumed the important task of Ambassador to the United States. Mr. Hu is the first person in our country to serve as an ambassador to a foreign country with the identity of a literary figure and philosopher. He served in office for a total of four years.

Those who went to the wharf yesterday to welcome Mr. Hu included Vice Minister of Education Hang Liwu, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau Gu Yuxiu, and Mr. Hu's son, Hu Zuwang. Mr. Hu's wife, Ms. Jiang Dongxiu, specially rushed from Luzhou to Shanghai last Saturday. It is said that Mr. Hu will stay in Shanghai for a short time and then go to Nanjing and then to Peiping with his wife.

### Under the Dumping of Foreign Paper, Many Private Paper Mills Shut Down

[Our News] According to Xu Huanming, Deputy Manager of the China Paper Industry Company, China's paper industry is currently facing the most serious crisis. Because foreign goods have been pouring in since the victory, the cost of Chinese paper is high, and the products cannot compete with foreign goods. There is no guarantee of sales, so most paper mills have fallen into a state of stagnation. There are currently twenty-one paper mills in Shanghai, seventeen of which are privately owned and four of which are state-owned, directly under the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Except for state-owned factories that must be maintained regardless of profit or loss, several private paper mills have already closed down, and others have entered a state of semi-stagnation. Mr. Xu said that the import of foreign goods is enough to manipulate the fate of the domestic paper industry, and the future of China's paper industry depends on the solution of the entire economic problem.

[This Newspaper, Hangzhou Dispatch] The Siku Quanshu in the Wenlan Pavilion of Zhejiang Province is a handwritten copy exclusively for the use of the Qing Dynasty, and it is extremely precious.

After the Agricultural Products Market is Abolished, a Jointly Operated Market is Being Organized

The Greatest Difficulty is the Lack of Suitable Site

[This Newspaper Dispatch] Since the Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Products Market was abolished, the city's vegetable and produce industry, in order to seek collective operation for the benefit of all vendors, has submitted a request to the Municipal Government for approval to establish a preparatory office for a jointly operated market for the Shanghai Vegetable and Produce Industry.

The Joint Operation Has Been Uniquely Approved

The Northern and Southern markets of the industry have jointly elected eleven representatives to serve as preparatory committee members. Yesterday, in order to understand the preparation situation of the market, the reporter made a special visit to Shen Jichao, a member of the preparatory committee. He said that since the establishment of the preparatory office, it has been actively preparing in the hope of early establishment. However, the original site, buildings, docks, and other facilities of the agricultural products market need to be investigated and returned to the original owners separately, so the site of the jointly operated market has become a serious problem.

Plan to Lease the Old Site

It has now been requested that the society instruct the Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Products Market Liquidation Committee to allow the market to continue to rent the original occupied sites of the jointly operated markets established by the former agricultural products market in the four districts of No. 16 Luban Road in the Southern City, Guangfu Road in Zhabei, Bailinan Road in the Western Shanghai, and the west end of Dapu Bridge before they are investigated and dealt with, in order to facilitate business operations.

Eleven Preparatory Members

The current persons in charge of the Southern City Market are Shen Jichao, Ma Wenbiao, Sa Xiancheng, Qi Sipin, Yan Muzhen, and six others. The Northern City Market includes Shen Jiaobin, Fei Zhenbi, Jin Weiyu, Shen Shengan, Wang Chuqing, and five others.

Vegetable Consumption

The consumption of vegetables in this city is surprisingly large. According to investigations, the value of vegetables transported from the surrounding suburbs to the urban area every day is about 60 million yuan in the Southern City, about 50 million yuan in the Northern City, about 30 million yuan in Pudong, about 20 million yuan in Jiangwan, about 15 million yuan each in Zhoujiaqiao and Zhenru, about 5 million yuan in Dapu Bridge, totaling 200 million yuan. And the actual money spent by citizens on vegetables every day is even greater, reaching about 600 million yuan. The difference of 400 million yuan is the cost of vegetables, the commission of merchants, and the interest of vegetable vendors. Among them, the commission and the interest of vegetable vendors are the main reasons why vegetable prices are difficult to fall.

Wholesale Prices

Here are some comparisons of the wholesale prices of ordinary vegetables: eggplant is only 12,600 yuan per dan, Welsh onion is 5,000 yuan, tomatoes are 32,500 yuan, winter melon is 9,000 yuan, Chinese cabbage is 11,000 yuan, cucumbers are 13,500 yuan, cabbage is 6,000 yuan, onions are 11,000 yuan. What are the current retail prices?

Commissions Should Be Reduced

During the enemy and puppet Central Market period, commissions were as high as 28%. After the victory and restoration, the Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Products Market was organized, and commissions were reduced, but they still reached 16%. Vegetable vendors increased costs, so they also arbitrarily raised their profits. Since the agricultural products market was abolished, everything has been let go. Some unscrupulous merchants have taken the opportunity to raise commissions.

After Mayor Wu took office, he was very concerned about rice prices and vegetable market prices. If the vegetable and produce market is established, it is hoped that there will be legal regulations on commissions and vegetable vendor profits to suppress vegetable prices and reduce the burden on citizens.

Public Bonds Mixed, But Overall Group C is Relatively Stable

Public bonds suddenly declined yesterday, but domestic bonds were lively again. The situation is still stable. Retail investors base their psychology on the proximity of the repayment period, so Groups A and B are despised first. This is also the recent trend of speculative psychology. However, knowledgeable people do not agree, so trading is still sporadic. As a result, Group C is relatively stable, and Groups A, B, and D fell by 100 yuan each. Group E fell by 60 yuan.

Chinese Stocks Show Mixed Gains and Losses

Most Still Affected by Tight Credit

The money market in Chinese stocks was initially stable yesterday, followed by tightness. Investors made different choices, so large stocks were more popular, while small stocks were despised again. At one point, the strongest stocks were Sishui Yarn at 460 yuan, Mei Ya at 2880 yuan, Jingfu at 208 yuan, Xinguang at 227 yuan, and Qindian at 185 yuan. At noon, large stocks were fluctuating in the middle, while small stocks struggled to catch up with the morning's low prices. The situation for unpopular stocks was pessimistic. As a result, compared with the previous day, Yongshui Yarn and Mei Ya continued to rise slightly, while Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qindian declined slightly. Unpopular small and medium-sized stocks all fell, and veteran stocks also felt unsupported.

Foreign Stocks

Foreign stocks were initially stable yesterday. Yisha fluctuated around 8500 yuan, and Yinglian fluctuated around 8200 yuan. Near the close, credit became even tighter, and large dealers in the industry were forced to cut their holdings to protect themselves. Bidding prices turned sharply downward. There was limited trading in Asia Steel and Ye Guang, and market prices did not change much. Most of the popular stocks were weak. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yisha and Yibei Paper fell slightly. Yinglian and Jardine Matheson fell by about half a percent. Asia Steel and Ye Guang did not have much time, so there was not much change.

Britain Plans to Dispose of Silver

To Promote Export Trade

[Reuters, London, 5th] According to the Silver Quarterly of the Montagu Company, the British Treasury, in addition to assisting necessary industries, is now prepared to use 1,000,000 taels of silver to promote export trade, of which 600,000 taels are silver tableware and 400,000 taels are semi-finished products. The Treasury plans to place all exported silver under this plan.

Tight Credit, Both Gold and Paper Money are Weak

Gold was peaceful yesterday. The market opened flat and tight in the morning. The opening price fell slightly to 1.92 million. The financial atmosphere was slightly eased. Later, it rose slightly. After 10 o'clock, the central bank distributed 90 bars, and the price also increased slightly to 1.9325 million. Scattered traders gradually increased, and the market rebounded to around 1.945 million, then some high-level suppliers emerged. At noon, it fell back to below 1.93 million. The afternoon was very flat. Day-to-day trading opened slightly higher, but people became nervous again, and finally fell back to 1.905 million. As a result, compared with the previous close, it continued to fall by 20,000. Gold ornaments were stable at 10,040, and silver dollars were also flat. The black market interest rate remained tight, with interest rates ranging from 1.8 to 2.3 cents.

Foreign Currency

The US dollar was tight and high. Investors continued to raise prices of goods in the US, and inflation was more severe. The problem of positions was still fatal. Not only the US dollar, but also all other foreign currencies were involved in the vortex. The US dollar opened at around 2530 yuan yesterday, and briefly rose to over 2550 yuan in the middle of the day. It lingered around the morning opening price near noon, and was weak in the afternoon. As a result, it fell 30 yuan compared with the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were also facing more supply than demand, and the price fell from 540 yuan to 525 yuan, also falling 15 yuan. The money market was tight, and foreign exchange was also facing more supply than demand. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 540 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 660 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 89,000. There was less supply than demand. The US exchange rate remained unchanged.

More Monks Than Rice

Rice Shops Demand Universal Allocation

Rumor Has It That a Large Batch of Foreign Rice Will Arrive in Shanghai This Month

Sales of Flour and Miscellaneous Grains are Stagnant

The number of customer registrations in the rice market yesterday did not increase, and there was little trading among the industry. The market situation was rarely changed. The number of rice shops requesting allocation increased. Yesterday, the North and South rice markets allocated a total of 4,000 dan of Vietnamese rice to various rice shops, at a price of 46,000 yuan. The stagnation of flour sales continued, and the price fell by another 800-900 yuan. Small manufacturers stopped production, and there was very little activity from retail investors. There was still a lack of formal trading, and the price was reduced by more than 1,000 yuan. The oil market had more supply than demand, and continued to fall by more than 1,000 yuan. Wheat bran also fell by 100 yuan. High-quality soybeans were firm, and medium- and low-quality soybeans fell by 500-600 yuan. Soybean sales were stagnant, and prices were flat and weak.

The China Grain Industry Corporation and other agencies, in order to relieve the domestic food shortage, have ordered a large amount of foreign rice from South America and other countries with surplus grain. This foreign rice has now been shipped to China. In addition, a large amount of foreign rice from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) will also arrive soon. According to statistics, 200,000 dan will arrive within half a month. Relevant parties have received telegrams and are planning distribution and pricing methods.

Recent Prices of Tung Oil and Hog Bristles in the New York Market

The foreign affairs department of the Bank of China believes that domestic exports of tung oil and hog bristles have been quite high recently, and domestic exporters need to understand the prices of these goods in the United States. It has cabled someone in New York to be responsible for reporting regularly. According to the telegram, on July 1, the old price of sufficient tung oil in New York was US$0.38-0.39 per pound for bulk oil tankers and US$0.39-0.41 per pound for drums. This is the price limit set in 1942. Since the silver price was cancelled, no accurate market price has been seen. The price of Hankou hog bristles for delivery in New York (CAF. New York) is US$4 per pound for 70%, and the price of Shanghai 70% is US$2.3 per pound. The market needs Hankou hog bristles more.

The Money Market is Still Tight

There is No Improvement in Yarn and Cotton Cloth

Yesterday, yarn and cloth still lacked signs of improvement. The financial storm had not subsided, and sales were weak. People in the industry who wanted to sell their goods and make money were still flooding the market, causing 20-count yarn to fall by 30,000 again, and small and medium-sized miscellaneous brands also fell by 20,000-30,000. There was no improvement in fine yarn and thread. The future of the yarn market is to wait for the relaxation of credit and the expansion of sales before there is hope for recovery. At noon, the Textile Construction Company continued to lower the yarn price by 20,000-100,000 as usual.

Yesterday, the New York cotton market was closed due to the celebration of Independence Day, and there was no news. The current cotton trading in this port, although gold is expensive, credit is still tight, so some manufacturers are still slightly waiting and seeing. Therefore, trading has declined somewhat. Only the Shenxin No. 1 Factory imported a small amount of NT. In addition, the flower shop had some decorative trading. The market price was stable.

Sales of cloth were not smooth, and were still affected by tight credit. Most floating households sold out, but the Shilin cloth was largely absorbed by all households, and the selling price was stable. However, grey cloth and bleached cloth continued to fall by 250-500 yuan. In the afternoon, the market situation did not change much from the previous day.

Deed Registration for Real Estate as Collateral Has Been Resolved

The Trust Department of the Bank of China Can Handle It on Behalf

[This Newspaper Dispatch] The current real estate industry is sluggish, directly affecting housing problems and indirectly affecting financial and investment problems. Deeds and other land title certificates have always been the most reliable collateral in this city. Invisibly, anyone with these certificates can immediately turn them into cash. When there is excess floating capital, real estate is often the most reliable option. Since the Land Administration Bureau promulgated registration regulations after the restoration, there have been many obstacles in practice. Therefore, both Chinese and foreign landlords are waiting and seeing. Recently, there have been many rumors about these problems. In order to report clearly and truthfully, the reporter visited Mr. Shu Fengxiong, a leader in the real estate industry. He was received and gave a detailed account: foreign deeds, such as those from the United States, Britain, France, and other countries, have not yet complied with the registration order due to treaty relations. Since Mayor Wu and Director Zhu of the Land Administration Bureau took office, they have invited relevant consuls to discuss the matter, and there are now concrete solutions.

For all foreign-owned deeds, if the property rights are indeed owned by merchants and citizens of their own country, the owners can apply for registration with the local Land Administration Bureau after obtaining a certificate from their own country's consul, and exchange it for a title deed.

Chinese-owned deeds, whether they are English, American, French, Belgian, Japanese, etc., can be submitted to. For the convenience of owners, the Trust Department of the Bank of China can be entrusted to handle the matter on their behalf. The procedures are convenient and the fees are low. For owners from England, America, France, and other countries that have signed new treaties, if there are any unclear points in terms of language and procedures, they can also entrust the Trust Department of the Bank of China to handle them on their behalf to facilitate matters.

If there are outstanding debts between the registered merchants and the owners, such as registration fees and advanced land tax and other fees, they should be handled directly by the registered merchants and the owners. This is not related to the government's registration this time. The above procedures are simple and easy to handle. Compared with the original regulations, they have been more flexible. Moreover, the government is determined to promote land administration. It is hoped that all owners will no longer wait and see, so as to avoid losses after the deadline.

Not Much Trading in the Sugar Market

Yesterday, brown and white sugar were slightly tight, but in the end, due to tight credit, there was not much trading. The association's current price for spot brown and white sugar was initially 100,700 yuan, then it was slightly lower. The closing price was 6,000-6,500 yuan. The stack price was 100,500-4,500 yuan, up 3,000-4,000 yuan. The dark price for road goods was initially slightly higher by 1,000-2,000 yuan, but it remained good later, without rising or falling, but it was still not as high as the opening price. Raw sugar was 100,250 yuan. The goods from Shantou opened with dozens of bags of ordinary yellow beans, 88,000 yuan. Jian opened with forty bags, 90,000 yuan. The market was flat and weak.

US Prices Have Begun to Rise

[Reuters, Washington, 5th] The Labor Statistics Bureau announced that the prices of 28 daily necessities suddenly rose by 3% on Wednesday. Since price controls were lifted on June 30, prices have risen by a total of 8%. The index listed by the bureau was 215.4 on Wednesday, while it was only 199.4 on the last day of price controls.

American Merchants Seek Chinese Camphor and Other Exporters

According to the external affairs department of the Bank of China, Magnus Mabee & Reynard Company of New York is seeking to trade with reputable and important export companies in China that deal in camphor, peppermint oil, anise oil, cinnamon oil, and musk. The company's annual sales in the United States reach US$10 million. Operating exporters in this city and other places can contact the international affairs department of the Bank of China.

24th International Cooperative Day

Dedication

The New Mission of the International Cooperative Movement at the Present Stage

By Chen Zhongming

Grasping the historical regularity of all development stages is the prerequisite for the study of all historical topics. As democratic politics triumphs over dictatorial politics and the United Nations rebuilds the foundation of world peace, the 20,000 cooperators around the world, regardless of race or nationality, who share the common pursuit of human justice and the protection of world peace, joyfully welcome the 24th International Cooperative Day. Undoubtedly, this has epoch-making historical significance.

As early as a century ago, in 1835, Robert Owen, the founder of the world cooperative movement, organized the Association of All Classes of All Nations in London, attempting to use the power of international cooperation to eliminate human exploitation and war and realize his utopian cooperative ideal. Owen's world organization was the most primitive form of international cooperation.

From Owen's Association of All Classes of All Nations to the International Cooperative Alliance, the development of the international cooperative movement to the present stage can be divided into four stages for study, so that we can gain a correct understanding of the basic content and new tasks of each development stage and more confidently open up its bright future.

From the establishment of the International Cooperative Alliance in 1895 to the holding of the conference in Münster in 1902, this was the embryonic stage of the international cooperative movement. During this stage of development, the ideal and methods of international cooperation were determined. The main content was to promote the cooperative movement to break away from the narrow scope of nationalism and regionalism and leap into an international cooperative alliance without race or nationality. This progressive change, from the perspective of cooperative republic and world harmony, from individual to collective, from various countries to international unity, undeniably achieved a significant task. Although Rochdale may be judged by history today as a wrong path, at the time when capitalism was just emerging, the Rochdale pioneers did indeed make considerable and valuable enlightenment work for the vast working masses who were plunged into hunger and cold by the surge of the industrial revolution. The charter of the International Cooperative Alliance included the following provisions: "The purpose of this association is to inherit the work plans of the Rochdale pioneers and to replace the current competitive system of private enterprises with an independent spirit and its own methods, basing the interests of this whole society on the cooperative system of self-help and mutual assistance." This is obviously an abstract statement, but it is enough to illustrate the contradiction between the international cooperative movement and the existing private system and the tasks it bears. As the late Secretary-General of the International Cooperative Alliance, Mr. May, said: "To unite the people of the world and increase the happiness of individuals; at the same time, to create the civilization of the

### Gas Supply Falls Short of Demand; Plans to Establish a New Plant

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to Mr. Spielkins, an engineer from the British-owned Shanghai Gas Company, the gas supply situation in the city is becoming alarming. The consumption of gas does not decrease even in hot weather. According to statistics at the end of June this year, the average daily consumption is 3.81 million cubic feet, an increase of 0.311% compared to the 3.798 million cubic feet consumed daily in mid-February. Compared to the 3.05 million cubic feet consumed daily in June 1941, this represents an increase of 25%. Mr. Spielkins believes that this phenomenon is unacceptable. The company's current production is at its maximum limit and is approaching a dangerous state. Mr. Spielkins also stated that gas is currently the cheapest fuel in Shanghai. Because the price is too low, the quality is no longer as pure and effective as it was before the war. The raw materials for gas originally came from India, Canada, the United States, and North China. However, due to the development of local industries in India and the high demand for coal, and the labor strikes in the United States, the Shanghai stock of materials is low. However, the company is making every effort to facilitate the shipping of coal to Shanghai. In addition, there are plans to establish a new plant. Most importantly, it is hoped that the citizens will cooperate and reduce consumption as much as possible to overcome this difficult time together.
