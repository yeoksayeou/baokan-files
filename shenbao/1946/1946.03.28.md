### Military Three-Person Committee Issues Order: Dispatching Teams to the Northeast; Political Issues to Be Decided Separately

[Our Northern Peiping Dispatch, 27th] After Zhou Enlai's return to Chongqing, the Military Three-Person Committee, after further consultations, has decided to dispatch executive teams to the Northeast. It telegraphed the Northern Peiping Executive Headquarters today to make preparations for the selection of personnel for each team. The Executive Headquarters held meetings all day for this matter. Reporters learned from various sources that, in addition to receiving the above instructions, the Executive Headquarters has not yet received more detailed and specific principles. According to relevant sources, some principles for resolving the Northeast issue have already been decided or are being discussed by the Military Three-Person Committee in Chongqing. The Northeast executive teams will implement these principles. The authority of the teams sent to the Northeast is the same as that of those sent to various parts of North China, bearing the responsibility for resolving problems locally, and not just for investigating and collecting materials.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] Before General Marshall returned to the United States, the Three-Person Conference reached an agreement to dispatch executive teams to the Northeast in the near future. To achieve this, government representative General Zhang Zhizhong, Communist representative General Zhou Enlai, and General Gillem, General Marshall's representative, continued to negotiate and have now reached an agreement. The instructions issued by the Military Mediation Department for the dispatch of executive teams to the Northeast are as follows: These executive teams, composed of carefully selected personnel, should be dispatched to the Northeast to carry out the following instructions: (1) The task of the teams is limited to military mediation work; (2) The teams should work in the areas of the government army and the Communist army, and avoid entering areas still occupied by Soviet troops; (3) The teams should go to conflict sites or locations where government and Communist forces are in close contact to stop conflicts and make necessary and fair mediations. All parties also agreed that the Three-Person Conference will continue to discuss military issues in the Northeast, and political issues will be discussed separately to seek a solution quickly.

[US News Service, Northern Peiping, 27th] Regarding the dispatch of executive teams to the Northeast by the Mediation Executive Headquarters, the Mediation Executive Headquarters here has also issued a public announcement. If the weather is good, the executive teams will depart on Friday. The work locations have not yet been announced. A more detailed report on the tasks of the executive teams sent to the Northeast will be released within days. The American personnel to be sent to the Northeast have already been decided, including Colonel Doteloder, director of the Second Executive Team who previously worked in Chifeng; Colonel Guley; Colonel Davenport; Colonel Barber; Colonel Tanleyk; and Alabama, director of the Fifth Executive Team who previously worked in Zhangjiakou.

[Associated Press, Northern Peiping, 27th] The locations to which the executive teams for stopping conflicts in the Northeast will be sent are generally speculated to be Shenyang, Changchun, Yingkou, and the border between the Northeast and Rehe. It is said that the Communist army has been reinforcing the Northeast from there.

### Huaiyin Team Arrives in Haimen for Inspection; To Proceed to Northern Jiangsu Early Next Month; North China Transportation and Postal Government Needs Efforts to Recover

[Our Nanking Dispatch, 27th] Military news: Lieutenant Colonel Dunk, the American representative of the Military Mediation Department's Huaiyin Team; Xiao Fengqi, the government representative; and Han Nianlong, the Communist representative, arrived in Haimen today to inspect the actual situation of the troops stationed on both sides of the conflict zone near Lingdianwei, sixty li from the city. If it is not necessary to go to Qidong for investigation, they can proceed to Yangzhou, Taixian, Shaobo, Qintong, and other places early next month. The commanders of the 25th Army of the National Army and the local government in Yangzhou and Taizhou are preparing to welcome them. Gentry and merchants from various counties and towns in Northern Jiangsu have been flocking to Yangzhou since yesterday to await their arrival.

[Our Nanking Dispatch, 27th] Zhenjiang News: Among the four agreements established by the Military Mediation Department's Huaiyin Team in Nantong, the third one regarding the use of legal tender in the Communist-occupied areas of Jiangsu is extremely important. This is because the Communist army in Northern Jiangsu forces the people to use anti-Japanese currency in its occupied areas and suppresses the value of legal tender to an equivalent exchange rate of thirty-three to thirty-five yuan of legal tender for each yuan of anti-Japanese currency. It also severs postal rights and unauthorizedly prints stamps, and restricts and obstructs remittances from merchants in Northern Jiangsu with various harsh measures, almost leaving the families of those engaged in various jobs outside of the fifteen counties of Northern Jiangsu to starve to death. Students from various counties in Northern Jiangsu studying in Nanjing, Shanghai, Zhenjiang, and Yangzhou have mostly dropped out of school and become wandering orphans due to the cutoff of financial support. People from Northern Jiangsu in Zhenjiang are eagerly hoping that the Huaiyin Team will urge the Communist army to faithfully fulfill its promise of using legal tender and hope that a practical and easily implementable agreement will be established as soon as possible on the issues of "unified postal rights" and "open exchange."

[Our Northern Peiping Dispatch, 27th] Behind the optimistic attitude of the Executive Headquarters towards the restoration of transportation, there are actually some difficulties. Today, a transportation industry insider frankly pointed out to reporters that the restoration of transportation requires all parties to be open and honest and make their best efforts. Speaking of the achievements in restoring transportation in the past month, since the issuance of Executive Headquarters Order No. 4, apart from the restoration of a small section from Fengjiakou to Botou on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, nothing has been achieved in other counties under the jurisdiction of the Peiping-Tianjin area. In terms of telecommunications, more than 1,400 kilometers have been restored, but more than 1,500 kilometers have not been repaired due to obstacles to construction. In terms of postal service, it has not returned to normal. The government representatives of the Executive Headquarters had previously proposed several principles for restoring the normal state of postal service based on the ceasefire agreement, namely unified personnel, unified management, no unauthorized issuance of stamps, and restoration of the original postal routes. The Communist representatives have not yet responded to this. Furthermore, the Communist side has been quite active in repairing railways in its controlled areas recently, automatically building the Ping-Sui Railway towards Qinglongqiao and automatically repairing the Jiaoji Railway eastward from Zhangdian. Transportation industry insiders speculate that the Communist side's move is to obtain joint management rights.

[Central News Agency, Northern Peiping, 27th] It is learned that the Gaomi Team dispatched by the Railway Management Section of the Executive Headquarters has made no progress in its work so far. Chen Lu, the government section chief of the section, Geng Biao, the Communist section chief, and Hill, the American section chief, have decided that if the weather improves on the 28th, they will take a special plane to Qingdao and then to Gaomi for inspection and provide on-site instructions to ensure the smooth progress of the road restoration work. According to news from Jinan, when the Jiaoji Railway was being built east of Zhangdian to Xindian, the Communist army came out to stop it, and the road construction project has been suspended.

[Another Dispatch] According to news from Shijiazhuang, the road construction survey team was blocked from advancing when it reached Gaoyi. It is said that the area north of Gaoyi belongs to the Southern Hebei Military Region of the Communist Party, while the area south belongs to the Taihang Military Region. The team has repeatedly retreated from Gaoyi to Yuanshi to wait for negotiations. The route between Yuanshi and Gaoyi is expected to start construction within days.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 26th] After arriving in Laiyuan, the Military Mediation Department's Taiyuan Team convened a meeting of local military leaders from both sides on the 25th and has agreed on measures to stop the conflict.

### Wartime Civil Servants Cannot Be Both Loyal and Filial

The National Government Promulgates Commendation Measures

[Our Nanking Dispatch, 27th] In consideration of the fact that wartime civil servants whose direct ascendants died in the occupied areas were unable to attend the funeral, the National Government has promulgated measures for applying for commendation. They can apply for an inscription from the National Government, stamped with the great seal of "Royal Honor," to show that loyalty and filial piety cannot both be fulfilled, so as to commend them. The application procedure is for the party concerned to submit a report to the National Government's Civil Service Office through the agency where they work. When applying, they must submit a letter or telegram from their family at the time of death as proof.

### North China Railway Administration to Be Reorganized on April 1st

[Associated Press, Northern Peiping, 27th] The North China Railway Administration will be reorganized on April 1st. The Peiping-Tianjin Area Transportation Commissioner's Office and the Tianjin Railway Administration will be taken over by the newly established Peiping-Tianjin Railway Office. The headquarters will be located in Northern Peiping. The new office will manage the railways from here to Shanhaiguan, Suiyuan, Pukou, and Hankou, and will first start to add dining cars and improve the convenience of ticket purchase.

### Order to Return to the Capital to Be Promulgated Soon; Legislative Yuan's Regular Session Set to Be Held in Beijing Next Month; Government Urges Parties to Submit List of Government Committee Members

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] The date of the government's return to the capital was previously not announced due to limitations in transportation capacity, but the authorities responsible for transportation are striving to improve the situation, and the order to return to the capital is expected to be promulgated in the near future. In fact, personnel from the central party, government, and military agencies have been going to Beijing in batches. Among the personnel from the central agencies returning to the capital, the military agencies are proceeding the fastest. All personnel remaining in Chongqing can move to Beijing and complete the move by the middle of next month at the latest. The Central Corps Department of the Youth Corps has decided to go east in batches starting on the 5th of next month. The party affairs agencies are expected to start in mid-next month. The regular session of the Legislative Yuan is set to be held in Beijing in mid-next month. Personnel from the Supervisory Yuan and the Judicial Yuan have been going there successively. National Government staff are also scheduled to be processed in batches starting early next month. The important personnel of each agency will all arrive in Nanjing before May.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] A press conference for foreign reporters was held at 3:00 PM today, hosted by Minister Wu Guozhen and Vice Minister Liu Kai. Regarding the reorganization of the government, Minister Wu said: According to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, the selection of people from various parties as members of the National Government Committee should be nominated by the parties first. The government had previously notified the parties, hoping that they would submit the names before the opening of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Sixth Central Executive Committee, but the parties have not yet submitted them. The government is now urging the parties to submit the names quickly so that the reorganization of the government can proceed.

[United Press, Chongqing, 27th] Propaganda Minister Wu Guozhen stated that after the National Government Committee is reorganized into a joint group of various parties, the Executive Yuan will be reorganized, and then the number of seats that other parties will occupy in the Executive Yuan will be discussed.

### Northeast Headquarters Establishes Committee to Unify the Takeover of Enemy and Puppet Industries; Must Eliminate Past Bad Phenomena

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 27th] Xiong Shihui, Director of the Northeast Headquarters, attaches great importance to the takeover of enemy and puppet enterprises and assets in the Northeast. He specially established the Northeast Enemy and Puppet Enterprise Assets Unified Takeover Committee in the headquarters a few days ago. The key points of its mission are to ensure that the materials taken over are strictly guarded and that the production enterprises taken over are not allowed to be suspended, and to eliminate the bad phenomena of past takeovers in various places. The committee has now been formally established, with Xiong Shihui serving as the chairman and Zhang Jia'ao serving as the vice chairman. It has two departments, a secretariat and a supervisory office, and fifteen groups: military administration, finance, finance, education, transportation, economy, society, grain administration, agriculture and forestry, land administration, water conservancy, health, justice, propaganda, and relief. Ma Yi serves as the chief secretary, and Feng Xi serves as the director of the supervisory office. Special commissioners from various central ministries and commissions serve as the heads of each group to uniformly handle the takeover, custody, and disposal of assets in each province and city (municipalities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan) and to establish branch committees in counties and cities. All chairmen of branch committees are served by the chairmen of each province, the mayors of special municipalities, and the mayors of each county and city respectively, in order to promote the smooth progress of the work.

### Order in Shenyang Gradually Restored; Dong Wenqi Talks About Future Work; Focus on Hygiene, Improving Transportation, Reviving Education, Rebuilding Industry

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 26th] Mayor Dong Wenqi of Shenyang returned to Shenyang by plane on the 26th at noon after completing his work in Jinzhou.

[Another Dispatch] After the National Army formally took over the defense of Shenyang, the order here has been greatly stabilized. Our reporter specially visited Mayor Dong Wenqi. The following is a summary of the questions and answers:

(Question) People in Guan Nei are most concerned about the two issues of public security and people's livelihood in Shenyang. What is the situation of public security in Shenyang recently?

(Answer) Before the Soviet army began to withdraw and the National Army had not yet taken over the defense, there was a slight chaos in the city. At that time, there were three fires. After the National Army entered the city on the morning of the 13th, the order gradually restored. After the formal establishment of the Shenyang Garrison Headquarters, petty thieves have mostly disappeared, and the people's hearts are increasingly stable. At present, the local armed forces in Shenyang include the security team and the administrative police, with a total of several thousand people. After reorganization, the quality is still good.

(Question) Prices in Shenyang are rising day by day, and people's livelihood is difficult. What are the countermeasures of the municipal government?

(Answer) The reason for the recent price increase in Shenyang is mainly that after the Soviet army withdrew, the citizens' confidence in the military tickets issued in the past has decreased. Those who hold military tickets are rushing to throw them out in exchange for materials, so it is not easy to see circulating currency on the market recently, and the citizens cherish it very much. For now, in addition to continuing to use military tickets and circulating currency at an equivalent value in Shenyang in accordance with the announcement of the Economic and Financial Committee of the Northeast Headquarters, we urgently hope that the Ministry of Finance can determine a solution as soon as possible to stabilize the people's hearts. At the same time, restoring transportation and smoothing the source of materials can naturally reduce prices, because the nature of the price problem in Shenyang is very different from that of the ports in Guan Nei.

(Question) Can the mayor tell us about the central work of Shenyang's municipal administration in the future?

(Answer) There are four main tasks for the municipal administration in the future: (1) Public health issues. During the seven months before the takeover of Shenyang, the municipal administration was abandoned, and no one paid attention to cleanliness. Mountains of garbage accumulated everywhere in the city. The municipal government launched a clean-up campaign last month. After half a month of efforts, most of the city's garbage has been removed, and it will continue to be promoted to eliminate garbage and reduce diseases. (2) Urban transportation issues. The urban area of Shenyang covers 252 square kilometers, with a population of 2,166,000. Therefore, transportation is extremely important. There used to be more than 50 trams, but now there are only more than 10 left. We are speeding up the repair of old cars, but the main problem is the restoration of electricity. The electricity used by Pan City factories and other places relies on the high-voltage electricity from the Songhua River area. Since the Communist army destroyed the Dongling transformer station, the power supply has been cut off recently, and Shenyang's trams and tap water have been suspended as a result. We are now actively rushing to repair the large power plant of the former Northeast Arsenal, which can be restored in twenty days at the earliest. In addition, we plan to add buses to facilitate urban transportation. (3) Education issues. There are currently 36 elementary schools in Shenyang that have started classes, and the rest are being actively reorganized and can continue to open. However, the most lacking thing at present is teachers. We are training teachers from various schools on the one hand and establishing normal schools on the other hand to create complete teachers. (4) Factory resumption issues. There are a total of 4,570 factories in Shenyang, large and small, and 940 with more than 100 workers, accounting for 60% of the entire Northeast industry. There are a total of 300,000 workers. Therefore, in order to supply the needs of the people and solve the unemployment of workers, factory resumption is a matter of urgency. The recovery of heavy industry is more difficult, and civil industry is easier. If the grain mill machinery is pieced together, 20% of the factories can still be started. We hope that the competent departments can quickly send people here to preside over it.

### Communist Army Still Constantly Attacking Near Liaoyang and Fushun

Siping Street Factories Have Been Forcibly Occupied

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 27th] After the National Army took over Liaoyang, Fushun, and other cities, it is still suffering constant attacks from the Communist army. In the area within 15 li around Liaoyang and in the northeast area of Fushun, the Communist army launched fierce attacks on the National Army several times on the 23rd and 24th, but all failed. The National Army, which is heading north from Tieling to take over the area withdrawn by the Soviet army, is currently being obstructed by the fierce attacks of the Communist army.

[Another Dispatch] After the Communist army captured Siping Street, the seat of the Liaobei Provincial Government, they unauthorizedly established provincial, municipal, county, and district administrations, appointed provincial governors, forcibly occupied factories, plundered the people's property, and forced citizens to hold meetings, requiring them to express their welcome to the Communist army, otherwise they would be arrested. More than 100 citizens are currently missing.

### Tense Atmosphere Still in Changchun; Handover of Defense Said to Have Clear Decision Soon; Our Parachute Troops Waiting for Orders in Jinzhou

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 26th] The tense atmosphere in recent days seems to be gradually easing, and rumors have been denied by facts. Local people habitually say "Changchun is a blessed land." It seems that in the past fifty years, international forces have competed in this area, and Changchun has uniquely possessed the magic of "turning danger into safety." However, in fact, some kind of danger still exists. Three machine guns were found on a firewood cart entering the city a few days ago. Today, 23 Soviet tanks passed through the main street, climbed into the station, and drove elsewhere. The city police and security forces have also set up defenses in each residence. Therefore, the general phenomenon indicates that under the surface of relaxation, there is "tension" lurking. Today, Dong Yanping, the head of our important affairs delegation, met with Soviet Chief of Staff Trotsenko. The content is unknown, but the current problem is when will the Soviet army withdraw from Changchun, and when will the National Army arrive in Changchun. In other words, there should be a clear decision on the handover and takeover of Changchun. Because the handover in the style of Shenyang should belong to the past, and the handover and takeover from now on, starting from Changchun, should have a new method. This problem is not only a matter of great concern to the people of Changchun, but also to the people of Harbin and other places in the Northeast. Also, a plane came today and transported a batch of takeover personnel.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 27th] Sandbags have been placed in front of the gates of various military agencies on our side here, and defensive works are being rushed to be built around the buildings. The security forces are also checking vehicles in various key areas, and the atmosphere has become tense again. However, the order in the city is still as quiet as usual.

[Associated Press, Tianjin, 27th] Today's newspapers here reported that a batch of well-equipped parachute troops of the National Army are waiting for orders in Jinzhou, ready to take over the areas withdrawn by the Soviet army.

Dong Yanping, Liu Handong, etc., Fly to Jinzhou to See Xiong Shihui

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 27th] Dong Yanping flew to Jinzhou by special plane this afternoon to report important matters to Director Xiong. He said that a plane would return to Changchun in the afternoon, otherwise it would return on the 28th. He brought with him the records of yesterday's talks with the Soviet side. Also, Liu Handong, chairman of Liaobei, and Secretary-General Xu and other five people who were released and came to Changchun last night flew back on the same plane with Dong today.

[United Press, Chongqing, 27th] Vice Foreign Minister Liu Kai declared that the Soviet Union recently proposed that the Soviet army in the Northeast completely withdraw before the end of April. China has replied, stating that it can agree. An agreement in principle has been reached with the Soviet side regarding the National Army's use of the China Changchun Railway, and detailed measures are now being considered. The situation between China and the Soviet Union in the Northeast has eased, "but no one can say that this situation is on a very solid foundation." Negotiations are underway to hand over the defense of each city and town from the Soviet army to the National Army. The partial negotiations on economic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in the Northeast have been suspended since mid-February. When asked if negotiations would resume after the Soviet army had completely withdrawn, Vice Minister Liu replied, "I have no comment to offer."

[United Press, Chongqing, 27th] According to today's news, 10,000 Communist troops occupied Siping Street on the 16th of this month. The vanguard of the government army is now approaching the city and fighting the Communist army around the city. The news confirms that the government army entered Fushun on the 24th of this month. It is also rumored that the Communist army has opened a bank in Faku, north of Shenyang, and issued its own paper money.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 27th] According to personnel from the Liaobei Provincial Government who were released from Siping and returned, the Communist army that captured Siping this time is the so-called "Northeast Security Army," which also has the designation "New Fourth Army" and is under the jurisdiction of the "Liaoxi Military Region." Its lower-level cadres mostly come from various places in Guan Nei. Wei Zhu, the political commissar of the Liaoxi Military Region, holds the military and political power in the area. According to the three major factions of the Communist army in the Northeast, one is the "Northeast Security Army," commonly known as the "Shui Balu," which came by water. Another is the "Northeast People's Self-Government Army," commonly known as the "Tu Balu," but its cadres also mostly come from Yan'an, and its base is in the eastern area. In addition, there is also the "Northeast People's Self-Defense Army," whose base is in the northern Manchuria area.

### Peiping Accepts Small Denomination US Dollars

[Central News Agency, Northern Peiping, 27th] The Peiping branch of the Central Bank will start accepting small denomination US dollars and US dollar bonds and coupons worth less than 20 yuan from today. The exchange rate is 1,920 yuan in national currency per US dollar.

### Part of Surplus Grain from Sichuan Province to Be Shipped to Hunan Province for Disaster Relief

[Our Nanking Dispatch, 27th] Chongqing News: Government news, the Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry, and Food have sent personnel to inspect the Hunan disaster. In addition to instructing the Relief and Relief Administration to rush a large amount of flour to urgently relieve the disaster, the government will ship a part of the surplus grain from Sichuan Province from eastern Sichuan to Changde in western Hunan and then to the disaster area for relief. It will also allocate funds to the Hunan Provincial Government and the Yuehan and Xianggui Railways to properly draft a work-for-relief plan for approval. After Siamese rice arrives in Hunan more smoothly, it is also planned to purchase 50,000 tons, which will be transferred from the Yuehan Railway to Changsha, Hengyang, and other places for adjustment.

### Former Japanese Division Commander Kondo Detained and Escorted to Guangzhou

Okamura Yasuji to Be Arrested Soon

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 27th] Japanese war criminal Kondo Shinpachi, Lieutenant General and commander of the 130th Division of the Japanese Army, was detained and escorted here from Shunde yesterday. Also, Japanese prisoners Matsuguchi Shigeharu, Tanaka Hisaichi, and others, feeling the great tolerance of the Chinese people, have requested to stay in China to serve, and are now awaiting a decision from the Headquarters.

[Associated Press, Nanking, 27th] Okamura Yasuji, the former commander of the Japanese army stationed in China, has been suffering from a tongue disease for the past three months and has been unable to speak. General He Yingqin revealed a few weeks ago that Okamura is one of the important war criminals and will be arrested immediately after he has completed his work of assisting in the repatriation of Japanese prisoners and overseas Chinese.

### Assembly of Participating Political Councilors' Separate Review Meetings

Chairman Chiang Receives Participating Political Councilors

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] The current session of the Participating Political Council has held twelve meetings. The government's policy report has been completed. Starting today, the proposal review committee will convene. All group review meetings, except for the Third Special Review Committee, will begin at 8:00 AM today, with a break in the afternoon. Reviews will continue tomorrow.

[United Press, Chongqing, 27th] Chairman Chiang hosted a tea party this afternoon to receive participating political councilors.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 27th] Food Minister Xu Kan, yesterday at the Participating Political Council, condemned the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) for providing less supplies to China than to Hong Kong and the United Kingdom, and for not allowing Siamese rice to be transported to China. He stated: UNRRA had promised to provide China with 290,000 tons of rice and 750,000 tons of wheat and flour in the first half of this year. However, in January, China only received 15,000 tons of rice. Mr. Xu continued, China has urged Ambassador Wei Tao-ming in the United States to find ways to purchase 360,000 bags of American and Canadian flour, 200,000 tons of Siamese rice, and 300,000 tons of American and Canadian wheat.

### General Jones Announces in Peiping: U.S. Troops Will Not Be Sent to the Northeast; General Wedemeyer Scheduled to Go to Nanking Today

[United Press, Peiping, 26th] General Jones, Commander of the U.S. Forces in the Peiping area, stated: Although it has been officially announced that Soviet troops will complete their withdrawal by the end of April, the U.S. Marines will generally not be sent to the Northeast. When a reporter asked if the U.S. Marines might go to the Northeast to protect the railways, Jones replied: Currently, the U.S. Marines are protecting the Peiping, Tianjin, and Qinhuangdao railways, and the number of personnel is still insufficient. Another reporter asked if the U.S. Marines would be called to Huludao to assist in defense work. Jones answered with a "no."

[United Press, Nanking, 27th] General Wedemeyer, Commander of U.S. Forces in the China Theater, is scheduled to go to Nanking on Thursday before leaving Shanghai for the United States on April 1st, to confer with Major General McClure, head of the U.S. Military Advisory Group.

### Overseas Chinese Returning from Yunnan Urge Allocation of Departure Aid

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 27th] It is reported that the Overseas Chinese Rehabilitation and Relief Administration has prepared transportation in Kunming and will soon begin transportation. Returning overseas Chinese are packed and ready to depart, but the subsidies approved by the Executive Yuan have not yet been issued, preventing them from starting their journey. Most of them are Burmese overseas Chinese, but the rainy season will soon arrive in that area, making travel difficult. If they do not depart quickly, more difficulties will arise. Yesterday, representatives specially appointed by the overseas Chinese appealed to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, requesting them to write to the Executive Yuan to expedite the allocation of subsidies so that they can go abroad in time.

### Chengdu Gold, Banknotes, and Commodity Prices

[United Press, Chongqing, 27th] Minister of Propaganda Wu Guozhen stated today: Puyi, the puppet emperor of Manchukuo, has been arrested by the Soviet authorities and will be handed over to the Chinese side because he is a war criminal.

### Soviet Representative Threatens to Withdraw from Meeting; Security Council Reaches Stalemate; Truman Personally Sends Letter to Stalin; Iranian Prime Minister Denies Agreement with the Soviet Union

[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 27th Broadcast: Within hours, the Security Council will reconvene to hear the report of the Tripartite Committee established yesterday. Whether the Security Council will accept the Soviet Union's request to postpone the Iranian issue until April 10th will be revealed. According to Soviet representative Gromyko, if the General Assembly discusses the Iranian issue before April 10th, the Soviet Union will withdraw from the meeting. Therefore, the meeting has reached a serious impasse. To save this crisis, President Truman has personally sent a letter to Stalin, which is being carried by the newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, who will arrive in Moscow tomorrow. The situation is expected to change dramatically. At the same time, British representative Cadogan has telegraphed London for new solutions to cope with the crisis.

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 27th Broadcast: French representative Parodi, attending the Security Council, received orders from the French government today to assume the position of mediator on the Iranian issue, and to strive to defend the Atlantic Charter and safeguard the sovereignty of small countries.

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 27th Broadcast: The Iranian Prime Minister today denied that he had reached a new agreement with the Soviet Union regarding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Iranian territory. This statement is quite credible because Iran has consistently disagreed with the Security Council's postponement of the Iranian issue. Observers believe that the Soviet Union's reasons for requesting a postponement are twofold: (1) Negotiations on Iranian oil production may be nearing completion before April 10th; (2) The reorganization of the Iranian government and the status of Azerbaijan may also be determined by then.

[United Press, New York, 26th] Today's meeting of the United Nations Security Council, by a vote of nine to two, accepted the proposal of the United States and the United Kingdom, deciding to include the Soviet-Iranian case as item four on the agenda. Aligned with the United States and the United Kingdom were China, Australia, Mexico, Egypt, the Netherlands, France, and Brazil, with only Poland opposing. Chinese representative Guo Taiqi, in his capacity as President of the Council, did not vote. After Soviet representative Gromyko's strong struggle failed, he suggested postponing the case for discussion until April 10th. Gromyko declared that he could not attend the Security Council meeting to discuss the Iranian complaint. It is unclear whether this statement means that he will withdraw if the Council rejects his proposal for postponement, or whether he has not yet received instructions from Moscow authorizing him to participate in the discussion at this time.

[Reuters, New York, 27th] This agency has learned from authoritative sources: Iranian Ambassador to the United States, Ala, has been granted full powers by the Iranian government to protest at today's Security Council meeting against the continued occupation of northern Iran by Soviet troops and interference in Iran's internal affairs. Soviet representative Gromyko expressed doubt at yesterday's Council meeting as to whether Ambassador Ala had the right to speak on behalf of the Iranian government. A spokesman for the Iranian side specifically stated that Ambassador Ala has maintained constant contact with the Tehran government in the past few days, and the Iranian government instructed him to change or withdraw the protest he submitted to the Security Council based on instructions received on March 15th. A telegram received here today from Tehran confirms that the Soviet and Iranian governments have not reached an agreement to resolve the dispute.

### Military Staff Committee Meeting; Shang Zhen Elected as Chairman; First Meeting Lasts Only Ten Minutes; Britain and the United States Do Not Intend to Raise the Issue of Atomic Bombs

[Central News Agency, New York, 26th Special Dispatch] General Shang Zhen, the Chinese representative to the United Nations Military Staff Committee meeting, was elected as Chairman of the meeting at the first meeting held here today. Soviet representative General Vasilyev relinquished his candidacy and supported General Shang Zhen's election. His term as Chairman will expire on April 30th, which differs from the situation in the United Nations Security Council, where the Chairman is rotated among representatives in alphabetical order based on the country's name. The Chairman of the Military Staff Committee is determined based on seniority. It is generally recognized that General Shang Zhen has the highest seniority among the representatives from the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France, having served in the military for 25 years. The first meeting held today lasted only ten minutes. Meetings will continue tomorrow to discuss the reports submitted by various subcommittees on plans to organize an international peacekeeping force. The work of the Military Staff Committee meeting is extremely confidential. The participating representatives all refuse to disclose which subcommittee was assigned or what issues were discussed. According to U.S. representative General Kenney, the meeting will discuss various defense issues, and the issue of atomic bombs will also be discussed if raised. It is heard that he said: Britain will not raise the issue of atomic bombs as a topic for discussion in the meeting, but if other countries raise it, it is impossible to prevent it. General Kenney further denied the recent rumor that the Military Staff Committee has estimated that the number of troops to be dispatched by the Security Council is approximately two million.

Editorial

### Establishment of the Provisional Municipal Council of Shanghai

The Provisional Municipal Council of Shanghai was officially established today and is about to convene meetings to discuss and resolve various matters concerning the city's municipal affairs that need to be established or reformed. These resolutions will then be submitted to the municipal authorities for implementation. The establishment of this council is of great historical significance. The Municipal Council is termed "provisional" because its members are constrained by objective circumstances and cannot be directly elected by the people. Currently, the municipal authorities are actively preparing for the election of municipal councilors. Before the elected councilors are produced, this provisional council will serve as a transition. This period is not expected to be too long. Although the members of this Provisional Municipal Council are appointed by the government, the selected individuals come from various sectors including finance, commerce, public opinion, education, and culture. They are all outstanding individuals of the time and are worthy of public expectation. Therefore, even though this Provisional Municipal Council is not directly elected by the citizens, it can fully represent the public opinion of the people of Shanghai. Shanghai is China's premier city. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the lost territories were recovered. The original special areas, such as the former "French Concession" and "International Settlement," no longer exist. The unification of Shanghai's municipal administration was achieved through the courageous efforts of our soldiers and the leadership of Chairman Chiang. The establishment of the Provisional Municipal Council of Shanghai coincides with this historical moment, and its significance is profound.

Municipal measures are closely related to the people's lives. In our country, local officials are often referred to as "officials close to the people" or "parents of the people," highlighting their closeness to the people. Whether municipal measures are appropriate has the most direct impact on the people. Therefore, municipal measures must be carefully considered. Shanghai is an international city, and it also had "concessions" in the past. Therefore, the measures taken in Shanghai's municipal administration are of great concern to international observers. Whether the municipal measures are appropriate not only affects the people of the city but also affects international perceptions. Now that the Provisional Municipal Council of Shanghai has been established in Shanghai, we will briefly discuss the current municipal administration, hoping it can be adopted by the Provisional Municipal Council, and also to offer congratulations.

(1) Establishing a Shanghai Municipal Financial System: Since the recovery of Shanghai, municipal revenue has been insufficient to cover expenses. According to news reports, the city's revenue shortfall for February this year exceeded 60 million yuan. Given the extraordinary circumstances, the failure of the city's finances to get on track was an unavoidable phenomenon at the time. However, now that the nation is at a pivotal moment of national construction, and Shanghai's recovery has been over seven months, municipal construction is an integral part of national construction and should seize the opportunity to move forward. But municipal construction requires funds, and the establishment of a municipal financial system is paramount. It is evident that the city's finances are unsound and unreasonable when such a large city relies primarily on revenue from entertainment and banquet taxes. China's financial system is divided into central and local levels. During the war, to concentrate resources for combat, most tax revenues were collected by the central government, leading to the depletion of local tax revenues. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, the division of the financial systems between the central and local governments should be readjusted. Entertainment and banquet taxes are general consumption taxes. The wealth of citizens varies greatly, and the burden is the same, which violates the principle of "taxation according to ability." American soldiers in Shanghai previously called for exemption from such taxes, which was approved by the mayor. After a long period of war, the people need to recuperate. Even if entertainment and banquet taxes cannot be abolished, they should be reduced to avoid disturbing the people. To broaden the tax base, taxes should be levied equally and directly on companies, factories, and firms that benefit the most from municipal services, so that the focus of municipal finance gradually shifts from consumption taxes and license taxes to direct taxes, thereby establishing a sound municipal financial system.

(2) Stabilizing the Livelihood of the People of Shanghai: Shanghai is the center of our industry and commerce, with a population of five million. Since the recovery, many factories have shut down, and unemployment has soared. Alternatively, labor unrest has erupted, and prices have skyrocketed, leading to instability in people's livelihoods. Although the reasons are complex and beyond the control of municipal authorities, the municipal authorities should do everything possible to stabilize the livelihoods of citizens. In the past seven months, the measures taken by the municipal authorities that directly affected the lives of Shanghai citizens have often been more restrictive than supportive. A single prohibition order can affect the lives of millions of people. At this difficult time, the municipal authorities have not only failed to create more opportunities for citizens but have also disrupted existing livelihoods with restrictions. The people of Shanghai, under the tyranny of the enemy and puppets, looked forward to the return of the national army, but what they have received since the recovery has not been warmth but hardship. This has created a very unwise impression among the general public. Moreover, one of the most absurd things is that after Paris and Tokyo abolished the public prostitution system, the Shanghai municipal authorities are still planning to establish a public prostitution system in Shanghai. This is not only a disgrace to Shanghai but also to the whole of China. In order to maintain Shanghai's reputation and China's national dignity, we cannot allow the establishment of a public prostitution system or the demarcation of "red-light districts" in Shanghai. Now that the Provisional Municipal Council of Shanghai has been established, we hope that the council members can urge the municipal authorities to do more to support the stability of the lives of Shanghai citizens from a proactive perspective and issue fewer prohibitions that restrict or exploit the basic freedoms of the people.

(3) Establishing a Shanghai Municipal Transportation System: Shanghai is our country's largest city. Modern cities must have a perfect transportation system. New York and London have subways that extend in all directions, as well as buses and trams running throughout the city. Both London and New York have dedicated transportation agencies to oversee these matters. In the past, due to the existence of "concessions" in Shanghai, each acted independently, so a complete municipal transportation system has not yet been established. Since the recovery, the Shanghai municipal authorities have been actively adjusting the existing structure. According to yesterday's news in this newspaper, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau is planning to systematically reorganize the traffic routes of the city's trams, trolleybuses, and public buses. The main lines will be served by trams and trolleybuses, and branch lines will be served by public buses. However, in modern urban transportation, trams are no longer suitable due to frequent road traffic. The main transportation lines in London, New York, and even Paris and Moscow rely on subways. Even Tokyo has subway transportation. For the future prosperity of Shanghai, it seems that we should abandon trams and plan for a subway network. In terms of the current situation, public buses have not yet fully resumed service, leading to overcrowded trams, which urgently needs to be improved. Actively establishing a Shanghai transportation system is essential to restoring Shanghai's prosperity.

### A Smart and Beautiful Italian Girl - Female Spy Bianca (Continued)

— Special Correspondent Liang Feng in Guangzhou for This Newspaper

She said: Her beauty has caused many entanglements; many people hate her because they cannot get her love.

As for her husband, Mr. Tan, he was originally a colonel and battalion commander of the New First Army's search battalion, a native of Xinhui, Guangdong, and is indeed in Guangzhou now. He believes that Bianca's arrest is "caused by her beauty." He does not believe that Bianca is a spy. He said: In 1938, he took Bianca and two children to Rome and returned to China. He arranged for Bianca to live in Duyun, Guizhou, where she lived for more than two years. Because of the bombing by enemy planes, she moved to Guilin. In Guilin, she was still threatened by enemy planes, so he sent her to Hong Kong again. When she arrived in Hong Kong, the European war had already broken out, and the British government expelled Bianca, so she went to Shanghai. From then on, he could no longer communicate with Bianca. Later, she went to Guangzhou and Hong Kong, Guangzhou to look for her husband. At that time, she met Simon. Soon, she received the news that her husband had died in battle in Burma. For the sake of life and for the sake of her children, she had to live with Simon. When Japan was about to surrender, she returned to Shanghai from Guangzhou for her child's illness. After the war ended, she learned from an American major who had fought with her husband in Burma that her husband had returned to Guangzhou. She was very happy and returned to Guangzhou on November 10th last year. However, she still could not find her husband after arriving in Guangzhou, and the hotel was too crowded to find a room, so she still went to live with Simon in Shamian. However, at that time, she had been suspected by the authorities of being a spy and had been under surveillance for a long time. This Colonel Tan said the above words with great emotion. Finally, he also put forward several reasons to defend her: (1) She is the mother of five children, and she is of noble birth. She does not need to act as a spy. (2) Her travels between Guangdong and Shanghai were on civil aviation planes, which were applied for in accordance with proper procedures from the Japanese military. (3) The reason why she had dealings with the Japanese was purely for applying for a passport. The Japanese delayed her because they found her beautiful. (4) She was detained by the Japanese four times because she was the wife of a Chongqing military officer and was suspected of being a Chongqing spy. This shows that she had no relationship with the Japanese. (5) She lived with Simon purely out of necessity for life. (6) Witnesses who can be found in Guangzhou include the secretary of the French Consulate and a Japanese person. However, there are more witnesses in Shanghai who can prove that she is a good person.

After Colonel Tan defended Bianca in this way, the case became more complicated. Bianca also repeatedly said that she was causing trouble because of her beauty, which could easily turn this espionage case into a scandal. Is Bianca really a female spy? Everyone can't help but wonder.

On the afternoon of the 19th, the Camp sent Colonel Tang Yanguang, director of the war criminal investigation team, and an interpreter to the hospital to conduct an informal interrogation of Bianca.

"What are the 14 million yuan of national currency that you brought to Guangzhou for?" Colonel Tang began to ask.

"This money was entrusted to me by a friend, Mr. Tang, in Shanghai to buy US dollars to make a profit. Later, I exchanged it for 11,200 US dollars. Except for the 5,000 yuan that was lost, the remaining 6,200 US dollars have been transferred back by my husband," Bianca replied.

"How did you support your family in Shanghai during the war?" Colonel Tang asked again.

"Simon paid for it! Because she loved my beauty, she provided for me." She sent a flirtatious glance to the serious Colonel Tang.

"When were you in Room 407 of the Kyoto Hotel in Shanghai, and what Japanese people did you have dealings with? What are their names? Do you also know a Chinese man named Mr. Dong?"

"I know Mr. Dong, but I have forgotten the names of the Japanese people."

"When did you live with Simon, and did you cooperate in anything?"

"In 1942, we did not cooperate in any business, except for entertainment. I like sleeping the most."

"Do you know a lot of Japanese people? Otherwise, how could you travel between Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Guangzhou Bay by plane and warship during the war?"

"No, traveling to various places by boat and plane was done in accordance with proper procedures."

"Was it very convenient for you to enter and exit Saito's office, and did you do so many times?"

"He was in charge of maritime affairs, so I often went to his office to apply for a passport."

"What is your nationality?"

"Italian. I married a Chinese man and am now Chinese."

When Bianca answered Colonel Tang's questions, she was constantly expressing herself, sometimes smiling and looking at Colonel Tang flirtatiously. But sometimes she frowned deeply. In this short period of time, she cried four times. Finally, Colonel Tang asked her to sign a statement admitting that she had said, "I married a Chinese man and am of Chinese nationality," and "All my living expenses at that time were paid for by Simon." Then Colonel Tang left.

The reporter followed Colonel Tang out of Boji Hospital and had a long conversation. According to him, acting and expressing oneself are common tricks of female spies. They are used to seeing such things. She has told reporters from various newspapers that she is causing trouble because of her beauty, which is likely to be a deliberate attempt to shift people's attention. In fact, this matter is not so simple and is quite complicated. The Camp has now collected a lot of information about this female spy case and will publish it after further study.

The reporter also asked Colonel Tang about the points that Colonel Tan made to defend Bianca. His reply was: It is true that Tan and Bianca were married, but they are divorced. They divorced in Shanghai, and the evidence is already in our hands. However, they have not mentioned their divorce. If they were indeed divorced during the war, then Tan would naturally not know about Bianca's actions after 1941, and he should not defend her. As for saying that she is of noble birth and does not need to be a spy, this is also not a sufficient basis. We all know that the two most famous female spies in the world are of noble birth. Furthermore, she took civil aviation planes between Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Guangzhou Bay during the war. You think, the enemy's transportation was completely controlled during the war. If she didn't have a lot of Japanese connections, it wouldn't have been so easy to travel. It is also said that because of her beauty, many people hate her because they cannot get her love. This is clearly an attempt to shift the matter to a love triangle. If we really believe this statement, then we are completely wrong. In fact, the fact that she and Simon once lived together is secondary. The key is still the issue of her past dealings with important Japanese figures!

Colonel Tang denied Colonel Tan's defense of Bianca. He seemed to have a clear idea of the case, but he was not at liberty to say more until it was time to publish it.

It was getting late, and the reporter parted ways with Colonel Tang.

The smart and beautiful Bianca is still sleeping quietly in Boji Hospital. I believe that if she is a good person, she will still be very quiet now; but if she is really a Japanese spy, then her shackles have not been removed, and these shackles will at least be on her soul.

Our county is located in a dangerous area by the river, with mostly poor land, and its people are loyal and righteous, with many virtuous and upright scholars. As a result, we were regarded as a poisonous target by the enemy and puppets, and were severely destroyed. Coupled with the recent disasters of locusts and moths, the entire county has suffered from both man-made and natural disasters. Fortunately, upon victory, our scholars and people all raised their heads and celebrated in the fields, believing that the government would surely show compassion. Now, with continuous rain and signs of disaster already forming, we are planning to ask the authorities for assistance and provide relief as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, the higher authorities ordered harsh demands, how can the people be at peace? Although our county is known as a rice-producing area, when calculated based on the population and land area, even with annual bumper harvests, it is difficult to be self-sufficient, let alone after the enemy and puppets searched and looted, and barrenness occurred repeatedly. The authorities should show compassion and properly arrange for rehabilitation, so that we can slightly restore our vitality and build the great cause of the nation. Jianqin and others are representatives of our town and on behalf of the surrounding areas, we appeal and request that you have mercy on the remaining people and allow us to be exempt from military rice," and so on.

### Fair-Priced Flour Continues to be Sold Yesterday Saw Resumption of Payment Collection - Each Bag Still Sells for Six Thousand Yuan

[Our Own Dispatch] The fair-priced flour sold by the Shanghai branch of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) resumed yesterday with the fifteen banks entrusted to collect payment for the flour having resumed accepting payment. It continues to be sold to the city at a price of six thousand yuan per bag. However, those waiting to make payments in front of the banks were extremely crowded, with the lines very long.

Payment Time - 3 PM to 5 PM

The reporter inquired with the person in charge of the CRRRA about the temporary suspension of the supply of fair-priced flour. It was reported that the Administration had long expressed its determination to sell fair-priced flour without restrictions and will do its best to achieve this goal, with no intention of stopping it. This time, the Administration did not suspend sales, it was because the banks temporarily stopped collecting payments because collecting payments for flour affected their normal business, which led to the temporary suspension of the supply of fair-priced flour. The time for collecting payments at each bank has now been adjusted to 3 PM to 5 PM daily (except Sundays). The newly set collection time is outside the business hours of each bank, which should not affect the business of each bank.

Preventing Malpractices - Limited to One Bag per Person

It was also reported that the Administration stipulated a limit of only one bag of flour per person to prevent "scalpers" from buying in large quantities for profit, preventing ordinary citizens from buying it. However, dealing with the activities of "scalpers" is proving difficult, and the Administration is now planning to introduce new measures to purchase flour to eliminate this malpractice. As for Director Jiang Tingfu of the CRRRA, he will return to the city in early April after attending the UNRRA food conference, at which time he will give a detailed report on the UNRRA's food allocation plan.

In early January of 1933, when the puppet government implemented the "cleansing the countryside" policy in Minhang, Huang accepted an appointment from the puppet Shanghai County North Bridge District Office to serve as the director of the Minhang Public Sales Office. He organized patrol teams stationed at key water and land transportation points to intercept rice merchants and forcibly collect rice. On March 2 of the same year, a villager named Jiang Shunshan transported 65 loads of rice by boat back to his residence in Tangwan. The patrol team discovered this and brought him to the Minhang Public Sales Office, where the rice was confiscated. Huang was later promoted to manager of the office. The case was reported by the Jiangsu Province Investigation and Statistics Office. The debates in the above two cases have concluded, and the judgments will be delivered on the 3rd of next month.

Another letter stated: "My bombing of Tokyo was in obedience to military orders. As a member of the U.S. Air Force, I knew I was taking the greatest risks, but war is war." The other two also wrote letters to their relatives, the words extremely poignant. The Japanese never sent the letters to their families. The lawyers for the accused, including Sawada Shigeru, requested the presiding judge grant them time to prepare their arguments, so the case is set to be heard again on the morning of the 30th.

### Orphanage Housing Dispute - Chengming Academy Appeals

Regarding the housing dispute at the Bethany Orphanage at No. 1933 Zhongshan Road, it was recorded in this newspaper on the 24th. Chengming College has claimed: "This college was originally named Zhengfeng College, and in September of the 29th year, it was ordered by the Ministry of Education to change its name to the current name. After December 8 of the 30th year, this college was forced by circumstances to relocate to Shangrao. After the victory, it was ordered to return. Unexpectedly, the original site and school buildings of this college on Jiaotong Road were used by Wang Zhenyun, son of the former president Wang Xishen, in May of the 32nd year in the name of his father who had died in July of the 31st year to sell them to Huang Zhongming, who then resold them to the Bethany Orphanage. This college believes that school property is involved and has filed a lawsuit according to the law. After the first-instance court judgment, an appeal is underway. As for the students moving into the original site, this college had already sent separate letters to the city police bureau and the Dachang branch for investigation and also obtained the consent of the orphanage. How can it be described as intrusion? Moreover, because of the continuous spring rains in the past ten days or so, the students were confined to two rooms, sleeping on the floor. Fearing dampness and illness, they recently sent a small number of benches and beds to the school. The students were in good order and never had any conflict with the orphanage. This college is quietly awaiting the protection of national law."

### Responding to Readers

Yue Xueqiu asks: I married Dong Suying in the summer of the 31st year through friendship. We have been married for several years and had a son, who unfortunately died at the age of three. Due to unemployment for many years, I had no choice but to start a small business to make a living, which led to a very difficult life. At this time, Suying left with her belongings to return to her mother's home. Last September, Suying was due to give birth, and I accompanied her to the Chu Seng Hospital in the South City, where I had pre-registered her for admission. I personally delivered food every day. After a few days, I was unable to go due to illness, and when I went to the hospital, I learned that she had been taken back by her mother's family. She has not returned for several months. I recently heard that she has given away the newborn daughter and says she does not want to live together and demands a divorce! If I do not agree to a divorce, she requires a separation of at least one year. I would like to ask: (1) Can a unilateral request for divorce be legally established? (2) If the term expires, can she say that I abandoned her? (3) Do I have the right to interfere with her actions during the separation period?

Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers: (1) One spouse requesting a divorce requires the other spouse to have one of the circumstances listed in Article 1052 of the Civil Code in order to do so. (2) Although spouses are separated, their status and all relationships such as support still exist. (3) Both parties have agreed in writing to separate for one year, so they can only request to live together again after the term has expired.

### Police Raids and Prohibitions Result in Soaring Stock Market Black Market Prices, Unified C Bonds See a New High of 3,300 Yuan, Stock Market Prices Continue to Rise

Public bonds are rising again, with Category C breaking through the 3,000 yuan mark immediately upon opening, reaching a high of 3,200 yuan. Some sellers appeared in the market, causing the price to retreat to 2,900 yuan, before returning to a little over 3,000 yuan at midday. As a result, Categories A and B closed 200 yuan higher than the previous day, Category C rose 450 yuan, Category D rose 150 yuan, and Category E rose 100 yuan. After the close, speculators moved again, pushing Category C to a new high of 3,300 yuan. Huayan was temporarily banned by the authorities midway through the day. Speculators at the Overseas Chinese Building and other locations also stopped trading. After the patrolmen left, trading continued with great enthusiasm. Each securities firm operated like a juggling field, throwing the prices higher and higher. All closed at their peaks at midday. The reason for this is that neither experts nor laymen can provide a valid explanation. In short, it is driven by speculative capital. With only a few hot stocks and a limited number of shares in circulation, Yongsha and Meiya have risen from thousands to tens of thousands. At the current rate, it is only a matter of time before they break through. This is far from investing and, should there be an unexpected drastic change, it is only the small investors who will suffer. The lowest prices of each hot stock during the day were slightly lower than the opening prices. As a result, Yongsha and Meiya each closed more than 10% higher than the previous day, while Jingfu and the other three smaller hot stocks rose by as much as 20% to 30%. Xinguang was actively pushed up, surpassing Jingfu to lead the smaller stocks. After an initial dip in the afternoon, it stabilized. In the end, Yongsha closed at 5,400 yuan, Meiya at 4,400 yuan, and Jingfu at 415 yuan. The trend of foreign stocks was the same as that of Chinese stocks, with eager buyers. The final result was that both hot and cold stocks closed up by 10% to 30%.

### Gold Prices Stable, Lowest Transaction at 1.53 Million Yuan, Closing at Slightly Less than 1.5 Million

Raw gold still failed to rally yesterday. Although the decline was limited, its momentum was gone. Those holding it were selling more than buying, and their enthusiasm was waning, making it extremely difficult to rally. The opening price in the morning was slightly lower, but stabilized after that. The Bank of China's allocation price remained unchanged. Traders felt the price was too high, so there was no need to register. However, the black market did not become tighter due to the lack of allocation sources, but rather loosened. The price even fell to a low of 1.53 million yuan before rising to around 1.55 million yuan at midday. The trading process was quiet in the afternoon. The final result was that it closed slightly lower than the previous day, down 15,000 yuan. Speculation on US dollars continued. Gold ornaments were 168,000 yuan, a large gold brick was 1,600 yuan, silver dollars were 1,100 yuan, and the interest rate discount was flat. Credit appeared to be loose, with interest rates remaining at 1.6 to 2 jiao.

### US Dollars Improve, Hong Kong Dollar Notes Hover

Foreign currency US dollars were initially weak but then strengthened. Importers wanted to settle foreign exchange, but it was difficult to obtain funds. Buying sentiment was slightly more active and trended towards stability in the afternoon. The opening price in the morning was below 1,950 yuan, initially calm, but rose slightly at midday to a weak 1,960 yuan. Supply weakened in the afternoon, and asking prices rose. Speculation on gold prices rallied to 7-800 yuan per ten taels. The final result was that it closed 25 yuan higher than the previous day. Hong Kong dollar notes were stable, but new notes were uncertain. The final result was that old notes were slightly better, up 5 yuan, while new notes mostly hovered. 1947 notes fell 5 yuan, while 1948 notes rose slightly by 5 yuan. Hong Kong Electric and Robi remained stable.

### US House of Representatives Passes Bill Authorizing the Treasury Department to Sell Silver, Priced at 71.11 Cents Per Ounce

[Reuters Washington, 27th] The US House of Representatives recently passed a bill authorizing the Treasury Department to sell silver at 71.11 cents per ounce for industrial use. Senators from western mining states have expressed strong opposition to this. A certain senator on the Senate Appropriations Committee argued that the Treasury Department should convert its 240 million ounces of freely available silver into cash at $1.29 per ounce. The Treasury Department's authority to sell silver for industrial use during wartime expired last December.

### Rice Market Firm, Soybean Oil Sources Arriving Continuously

Yesterday, the rice market remained flat because although rice merchants were confident, the retailers' demand was average, and arrivals from downriver were frequent, so they were unable to raise prices. Flour demand was weak and lacked vitality, with a slight reduction of 100 yuan. Bran also stopped rising and turned to fall, with the price returning to a small 2-300 yuan. Soybean cakes were oversupplied, and the price was weak and lacked vitality. Soybean digestion remained sluggish, continuing to fall by 3-500 yuan. Raw peanuts continued to trend stably, with arrivals and sales balanced. The oil market saw a surge in arrivals from Qingdao, with sources also arriving from Kaifeng. Scattered arrivals continued from Bengbu, Xuzhou, and other places. In addition, the enemy and puppet management office was selling oil at flat prices to various oil shops, and it was currently being sold. The market was calculated at 90% of the price, so oil prices were feared to be difficult to prosper for a time.

It is also reported that approximately 4,000 piculs of rice arrived in this city yesterday, including 2,873 piculs of white japonica rice, 823 piculs of thin rice, 230 piculs of early rice, and the rest being indica glutinous rice.

### Tea Transactions Rare, Anhui Tea Arriving Continuously

The tea market situation in this city has been sluggish and unable to rise for several days. The reason for this is that traders from Tianjin and other regions are reluctant to stock up due to sluggish sales. Although shops in this district have been involved, they only have scattered demand. After making profits, sellers frequently increase supply, causing the market to soften frequently, especially Wenzhou Bailin.

Also reported that since the victory, tea that had been imprisoned for a long time was massively exported, leading to competing purchases and a sudden jump in prices. The prices of Anhui tea, which had been stored for years, are almost no different from those in Shanghai. In particular, Tianjin tea merchants are collecting and purchasing tea, which is especially popular, so prices in the production areas have always maintained an upward trend and are unwilling to sell at lower prices. However, since the Tianjin tea market in recent months has been lackluster and export prices need to be raised, only one-third of the stored tea on the Xin'an River has been shipped. Only Wang Yutai here has packed 1,600 boxes for export, while the rest are waiting for the external price to rise. The freight rate for ships carrying 200 boxes each from Tunxi to Hangzhou is 600,000 yuan. The cost of transporting by car to Chun'an is 1,200 yuan per box, and then 800 yuan per box to ship from Chun'an to Hangzhou. Vehicles are very scarce.

### Cotton Yarn Market Quiet, Raw Cotton Transactions Completely Stalled

The Japanese yarn market still showed no improvement. Due to unfavorable weather, with heavy rain during the listing season, few people attended the meeting, and the market was extremely quiet. The price of Double Horse brand was still stable, but the price of the rest of the 20-count yarn was sought after by sellers, but there were few buyers, and the prices of all fell by 2-30,000. Fine yarn and thread were even more difficult to move. Sentiment still had not escaped from weakness. Yesterday, Fangjian opened sales of woolen blankets, serge, and other items, a total of 24 types. It is said that cotton yarn will be sold as usual today.

Yesterday, New York American cotton futures fell 11-17 points, with the near-term at US$26.97 and the far-term at US$26.91. The spot price of Middling cotton was US$27.55. Raw cotton transactions in this city were completely stalled, because both cotton yarn and cotton cloth showed little improvement, and the source of foreign cotton did not stop, so the number of Shanghai stocks increased without decrease. Factories and cotton merchants mostly took a dim view of prospects, and there was no negotiation news from Fangjian Company. Therefore, raw cotton transactions were not possible. It is said that factories will only make transactions when the end of the month is approaching.

### Allocated Rayon, Payment and Delivery Today, Silk Market Weak

Yesterday, the city's rayon market was quiet because silk weaving factories were allocated raw materials, and the payment and delivery were scheduled for today, with a price of 1.4 million yuan per box. As a result, transactions in the market stopped immediately, and the selling prices fell uniformly. 120-count Tianqiao opened at 1.65 million yuan in the morning, the lowest at 580,000 yuan, and finally closed at 1.6 million yuan, down 100,000 yuan from the previous day. Dull and semi-dull followed the decline. Transactions between factories and users were quiet. Sinfu Foreign Firm's 83-point or higher uniformity was 2.6 million yuan per picul, and 78 to 81-point uniformity was 2.5 million yuan per picul. Yesterday, there were more than ten piculs of transactions. The silk market was weak overall. Huocheng checks and crepes opened at 3,750 yuan per yard. The asking price for Meiya bedspreads was 1.15 million yuan per hundred.

### Sino-Japanese Silk Both Arrive in America; Chinese Silk Quality Surprisingly Good
[Reuters, New York, 27th] Approximately one hundred bales of imported silk have arrived here and are reported to be re-exported to Switzerland. So far this year, about two thousand bales have arrived. It is widely believed that a large amount of silk will continue to arrive, but due to domestic conditions and pricing difficulties, most will be used locally. It is said that the recently arrived Chinese raw silk is of remarkably high quality, exceeding expectations. As for Japanese silk imports, in addition to the 40,000 bales already in stock, 10,000 bales can be imported monthly. According to the director of the Japanese Raw Silk Inspection Institute, about 70% of the silk currently produced is available for export.

Thin Sheet Metal Plummets
Thirty-five-pound thin tinplate was previously in short supply, and prices would skyrocket with even slight purchases. Recently, American goods suddenly flooded the market, causing the market to plummet rapidly, with a catastrophic drop of more than three-fifths compared to mid-month. Each box of 350 sheets is now priced at only 170,000 to 180,000.

Timber Market Continues Weak
Yesterday's timber market was sluggish due to rain and slow sales. Moreover, with a considerable amount of fir strips arriving in the market and reports of foreign pine shipments, transactions were scarce, and prices softened further.

Resources Commission Materials to be Transported to Shanghai for Centralized Export
The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Resources Commission has shifted its focus of foreign trade to Shanghai. Special minerals managed by the commission will now be transported from various southwestern provinces to Shanghai for export. Yesterday, Guo Zixun, director of the commission's Foreign Trade Office, told reporters that due to transportation difficulties, the quantity of special minerals transported to Shanghai is still not large. Currently, the main task is to continue the wartime material exchange arrangements with allied countries to offset the military supplies provided by the allies to China. Guo also stated that the special minerals managed by the commission include tungsten ore, pure tin, pure antimony, mercury, bismuth, and aluminum, all of which are essential raw materials for military and industrial purposes.

All savings from various association certificates will be repaid based on the compensation reserve fund deposited by the pseudo-association. Special prize-winning savings certificates will be calculated and repaid based on the number of non-winning certificates and the average allocation of the deposited compensation reserve fund. All savings will be repaid in legal tender. Payments originally made in pseudo-currency will be converted to legal tender at a rate of 200 to 1, and amounts less than one legal tender yuan will not be counted.

Limited Number of American Automobile Exports
[Associated Press, Detroit, 26th] According to automobile manufacturers, automobile exports will be very limited in the next few years. The current domestic market needs over 15 million cars and trucks, and automobile manufacturers must first meet this demand. Since the victory over Japan, automobile exports have been minimal due to low production volume and a narrow foreign market.

Education and Sports
160,000 Children in Beiping Without School, Anxious and Nowhere to Go
[Our Newspaper, Nanjing] According to the Central News Agency in Beiping: The exact number of school-age children in Beiping is currently being investigated by the Education Bureau in conjunction with the Police Bureau.

Publicly Funded Student System to be Canceled This Summer?
[Our Newspaper, Chongqing] It is rumored that the public funding for students in national schools nationwide will be canceled this summer. According to the Chongqing World Daily, this rumor stems from the fact that the budget for student public funding in this year's education budget only covers the first half of the year (until June). The Ministry of Education believes that during this post-war recovery period, most students in national schools come from impoverished families and have relied on state subsidies for years. An abrupt termination would have a significant impact on their studies. Therefore, a special request has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for reconsideration and approval to continue the public funding system.

The regulations are as follows: Youth Army veterans who have not completed secondary school will be enrolled in secondary schools established by the various armies (fully comprehensive secondary schools). University graduates will be selected for overseas study for advanced training, with a quota of 300 students per army. All of the above students will receive full funding. As for employment, Youth Army veterans should return to their original agencies. If the service agency has been abolished, the Executive Yuan will prioritize their reassignment. In the future, the Youth Army will become a military education institution responsible for providing pre-officer training to high school graduates. Each training period will last one year, after which they will be reported to the Ministry of Education for unified distribution to various universities, and they will be exempt from entrance examinations.

Education Special Feature: Introduction to the Beiping Railway Management College by Xiao Jin
The "Beiping Railway Management College" is the youngest college within the Jiaotong University system. The "Nanyang" and "Tangshan" colleges both have histories of over forty years, while this college is only thirty-eight years old. However, its efforts in China's transportation construction are not diminished by its youth. Today, her graduates are diligently serving on several railways, highways, and other transportation departments across the country. Although the college is unfamiliar to the public, it is very familiar with society!

School History
As early as the late Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, railway construction was burgeoning like bamboo shoots after a rain, but the railway rights – including engineering and management – were entirely controlled by foreigners. This aroused dissatisfaction among the scholars and officials of the time, who suggested establishing schools to train talent and reclaim railway rights. In the first year of the Xuantong reign, the signboard of the "Railway Management Training Institute" appeared in a corner of the imperial city.

Following changes in the political situation, the "Railway Management Training Institute" was renamed the "Transportation Training Institute" and a telecommunications class was added. Later, the Ministry of Transportation transformed it into a vocational school, separating postal and telecommunications from railways into two vocational schools. Because postal and telecommunications and railways were brand new courses in China, the school had to rely on foreigners for all its equipment and teachers.

In the tenth year of the Republic of China, "Nanyang," "Tangshan," and "Pingyuan" colleges were merged and renamed Jiaotong University. A Railway Management Department was established in Beiping, and the postal and telecommunications school was spun off independently. The following year, it was renamed the Tangshan Jiaotong University Branch School, and then again as an independent college. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, after the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the Railway Department unified the three colleges, and the "Jiaotong University Beiping Railway Management College" officially met the public.

Purpose
Like the Tangshan College, after the call to arms for the War of Resistance against Japan sounded, the Pingyuan College only moved out hundreds of hearts unwilling to be slaves. Relying on the assistance of alumni, the faculty and students moved from Shanghai to Hunan, from Hunan to Guizhou, and from Guizhou to Sichuan. For eight years, it shared the same fate and lived the same life as the Tangshan College. They were brothers in adversity; neither could do without the other, and neither could rely on the other. Under the banner of "Jiaotong University Guizhou Branch School," they jointly cultivated transportation construction cadres for the motherland.

"Management" is a newly emerging science in modern times. American Taylor discovered the principles of management from the rotation of machinery, applied it to various industrial and commercial departments, achieved great results, and aroused the research and discussion of scholars, thus achieving today's achievements.

"Railway Management" is a branch of "Management." Similar branches include "Industrial Management" and "Financial Management." As the name suggests, "Railway Management" applies the principles of scientific management to railways, enabling them to exert the highest efficiency, develop excellent business, shoulder the responsibility of a "common carrier," and become the most powerful link in the country's entire transportation system.

Curriculum
The four-year curriculum of the Pingyuan College is aimed at these purposes. The first year is only general basic knowledge training, the same as the courses in a business school, but with the addition of railway-related courses, such as engineering and drawing, and principles of railway transportation. The second year is formal specialized knowledge. In addition to economics and monetary science, there are also courses such as "Railway Organization and Management" and "Passenger Transport Business." The preliminary courses in this year enable students to gain a preliminary and concrete understanding. In the third year, knowledge of railway management, transportation theory, and other subjects are instilled in the students. Eighty percent of the courses read in this year are railway and transportation-related, such as "Railway Freight Rates," "Air Transport," "Water Transport," and "Railway Accounting." All the knowledge and theory that a railway manager or transportation manager should have are laid a solid foundation in the third year. At the same time, knowledge of finance, such as finance, currency, international trade, and international exchange, is also indispensable, so it is also taught entirely in this year. The fourth year focuses on more advanced theories, such as railway operation economics, which is dedicated to discussing the management of railway transportation technology, such as the design of freight stations, the military facilities of terminal stations, the operating system and procedures, the marshalling and development of trains, and the handling and prevention of train accidents. Station management is also within its scope, covering the knowledge that a stationmaster should have regarding station construction, water supply equipment, track classification, employee leadership, and station appearance. Courses such as "Locomotive Construction," "Railway Engineering," and "Railway Material Management" are also indispensable knowledge for cultivating an excellent stationmaster or transportation manager. In short, in addition to railway and transportation knowledge, the four-year curriculum also includes the four-year curriculum of a common business school. The result of such training is not only a railway manager, but also a good accountant. In the past, the Pingyuan College established "Financial Management" and "Railway Management" departments. After the War of Resistance against Japan, due to social needs, it focused on training railway management talent. Eight years of hard work have enabled hundreds of young people to do dredging work for the motherland's arteries, railways and highways!

Present Situation
Turning back to the topic, let us report on the current situation of the Pingyuan College. Despite the material difficulties of the past eight years, the spirit remains as cheerful as it was eight years ago. The spirit of over thirty years of tradition permeates the faces of everyone. Over the past eight years, thousands of young hearts have yearned for her, but only one-tenth of them have been able to embrace her. Over the past eight years, she has not only received the love of young people, but also the praise of society. The fact that the graduates are all pre-booked shows how much society needs her!

Victory brought joy, but also brought distress. The Pingyuan College's return to its original location is also progressing amidst distress. The school buildings in Beiping, although taken back from the enemy, have been occupied again. "Negotiation" is just a powerless method. The "Pingyuan College Student Relocation Promotion Association," organized by all the students of the Pingyuan College, aims to assist her in accelerating her return. Alumni are also eagerly running around and contacting people about the relocation issue. According to letters from alumni, the Pingyuan College may be able to return to Beiping this summer, but there may be problems with the school buildings. The selection of the president of the college has also been decided, with alumnus Yu Shixuan taking on the role. What makes the students especially excited is that the graduates of this year's class may all be assigned to work on the Changchun Railway.

To meet the needs of national construction, the Pingyuan College will further cultivate talents in "Industrial Management" and "Financial Management" and share the mission of transportation construction with her two elder brothers!

March 21, 1946, in Bishan, Sichuan.

Councilors Raise Inquiries, Encourage President Song to Take Responsibility and Let Go; Appeal for Disaster Relief, Do Not Let the Republic of China Become a Disaster Nation
Our Newspaper, 23rd, Airmail News, Special Correspondent Zhao Haosheng from Chongqing
The day of President Song's political report was quite lively. He arrived early himself, and all the ministers and officials under the Executive Yuan attended. Chairman Wang Yunwu was in high spirits. The councilor's seats, reporter's seats, and guest seats were completely filled.
President Song began his report in pure Shanghainese, reading from a manuscript for a full two hours.

The reading of the written inquiries broke the quiet atmosphere.
Kong Ling addressed two points:
The bureaucratic habits of political officials must be eradicated, otherwise, who would be willing to work for them, and even if they were, they would not be able to display their talents.
Bureaucratic habits must be completely eliminated.

Ma Yefeng recounted that the Communist army was obstructing transportation in northern Henan, forcing people to relocate in Xixian and other places. At the same time, there were over one million troops stationed in Henan, and the people simply could not afford such military rations.

Zhao Shu questioned whether the Executive Yuan had implemented the resolutions of the previous Senate. He said that the situation in the recovered areas was so chaotic, and President Song, who bore full administrative responsibility, had visited Shanghai several times. What decisions had been made?

Zhao Xuefeng spoke about the many improper actions of He Siyuan, Chairman of Shandong Province, asking if President Song was aware of them. Xi Lun said that there were five large and small banks in Taiwan. He asked if there were any foreign exchange reserves. Why didn't the government quickly establish a central bank at that time? A councilor from the north recounted the Communist army's grain searches and conscription in North China, asking if the government was going to stand idly by and not help these people in North China. Wang Huamin said that Beiping, the cultural city, had become a garbage city. The government initially gave Hebei Province 30 million yuan for recovery expenses, but on average, each agency only received 100,000 yuan. He asked what 100,000 yuan could do. Wang Guanying asked if the government would continue to use legal tender or issue new currency. He suggested that the Changhe Bicycle Shop in Shanghai should be nationalized. Lu Zongqi asked why so many corrupt special envoys had not been dealt with. Zhang Jinjian pointed out that in the current political climate, there was talk of integrity, but everywhere there was corruption; there was talk of efficiency, but everywhere there was perfunctory behavior. He asked how President Song would resolve this.

Inquiries Came One After Another
Written inquiries were sent in one after another, and those who wanted to make oral inquiries were getting impatient. Hu Shuhua, with his big beard, suddenly stood up from his seat and shouted at the chairman, "I protest!" He asked why the chairman had initially announced that there were only eleven inquiries, but the number was increasing. When would oral inquiries begin? Wang Yunwu said righteously that reading the written inquiries first and then the oral inquiries was the law of the Senate. Finally, after counting, there were only six inquiries left. Councilor Hu sat down unhappily, and the reading continued.

Tang Guozhen asked if the Executive Yuan had any solutions for the Hunan disaster. Would they wait until people died before providing relief, or would they save the living? Tao Baichuan asked why the government had to print banknotes in the United States, causing the China Bookstore in Hong Kong to be unable to maintain itself. He also proposed that if Sun Yat-sen currency was issued in the future, it should never repeat the mistake of the 200-to-1 exchange rate.

Zhang Legu's written inquiry was a well-written four-six sentence essay. The last two sentences were: "When superiors and inferiors contend with each other, the country is in danger!"

After the written inquiries ended, the chairman stood up and said, "There are now twenty-eight people requesting oral inquiries. At five minutes each, it will take one hundred and forty minutes, plus a ten-minute break, for a total of one hundred and fifty minutes." In order to control the time, the bell would ring once every four minutes and twice every five minutes. Mr. Wang Yunwu's calculations were clear, and he advocated implementing strict "scientific management" at the conference.

The first to speak in the oral inquiry was Wang Hansheng. Wang, from the Northeast, brought a very heavy and solemn feeling to the entire room with his pure Northeastern accent. He said that recently everyone had been paying attention to the Northeast problem, and the Northeast problem was indeed too complicated. He would not talk about the various obstacles in other environments today, but on the political problem, he raised the issue of changing the administrative divisions of the Northeast. He said that he was not against reducing the size of provinces, but it should be done after everything had stabilized and the entire country was divided together. Because the problem of dividing provinces caused many personnel and organizational problems, delaying the process by two months, the Northeast has become the chaotic situation it is now. At the same time, the government should continue to appoint the three old chairmen from fourteen years ago... At this point, five minutes were up, and the chairman stood up and asked him to stop, which immediately aroused resentment from the audience, and many people shouted "Free speech!" "A special extension should be granted!" At this time, Wang Hansheng turned around and requested an extension of five minutes. The chairman immediately gave a "discount" and allowed an extension of two minutes. Wang still could not finish his words and ended his speech hastily, and the audience responded with an excited and regretful round of applause.

Next to speak was Zhu Huiqing. He first recalled the several guarantees President Song had made to everyone at the previous conference:
Adjust personnel, and if there is to be an adjustment, it must be thorough.
Inflation and high prices could be saved with a large amount of gold. The situation at that time was so generous and great! Everyone applauded and welcomed him. Then, he read the Executive Yuan's report. He faced President Song and said, what is the effect of all this? Hu Shuhua brought up the special salary of the China Textile Company, which was two thousand times higher with an additional four hundred subsidy. He said that if it was a rumor, please President Song "clarify the rumor" here. Xue Mingjian suggested that government orders should be unified. Su Ting asked if there was a solution to the recovery problem, saying that the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration had in fact become the "Head Office of Relief and Rehabilitation." Hu Qiuyuan raised three points:
The President of the Executive Yuan should coordinate the overall situation,
Pay attention to restoring production capacity,
Pay attention to the provincial government structure. He said that everyone initially had great "hope" for President Song, but later gradually felt "disappointment," and now it was close to "despair." He hoped that President Song could change people's feelings towards him with facts.

Another councilor asked why Miao Qiujie, who had been proposed for punishment at the last Senate meeting, had been restored to his original position. At the resident committee, Minister Yu had said that this was passed down by the President. He asked what President Song had to say.

Someone else mentioned that Beiping only had people receiving materials, but no one receiving legal matters. In the large city of Beiping, there was only one judge each in the civil and criminal courts. Where could all those cases be "pushed to"? Liu Shutong said that Wang Dongyuan, Chairman of Hubei Province, was a concrete example of a corrupt official, with ten thousand yuan as the minimum and the position of village head as the starting point, resulting in "people thinking of the Han" – thinking of the traitors.

Wu Puguang said that the diplomatic responsibility could not be shirked with the excuse that there could be no diplomacy without internal affairs! Wu Chunzu proposed that soldiers should not be used to govern politics in the future, so as not to waste their talents.

"Push," "Fake," "Chaos"
Someone mentioned that the Executive Yuan's policies were inconsistent, and the gold deposit donation was absurd. Minister Yu said that it was decided by the President, and asked President Song to answer. Regarding personnel adjustments, Huang Yuren had proposed at the previous meeting that it must not be like shuffling seats while playing mahjong, but the reality was just that. Jiang Yiping especially pointed out that the President of the Executive Yuan should be a generalist. Luo Heng said in a voice as heavy as a man's that the Sino-Soviet Treaty was not made public beforehand, and when it was submitted to the Senate for approval, not a single word could be added or changed. Before signing the Sino-French New Treaty, why didn't they consult the people of Yunnan? Why hadn't the border between Outer and Inner Mongolia been determined? Finally, she pointed out that it was possible for Bei Zuji to have endless problems managing foreign exchange pricing alone. Yin Shuxian asked if it was true that Bei Zuji had recently bought a car for his own use with 190 taels of gold.

Xu Deheng shouted loudly for disaster relief in front of his seat, otherwise "Republic of China" would become "Disaster China." He said that there were disaster victims now, and after recovery in the future, there would be disaster officials, disaster civil servants, and disaster burdens. Finally, he said that President Song would certainly not have the feeling of "let them laugh and scold" about all of this, right?

Jin Jian encouraged President Song to "take responsibility" and "let go," and Huang Yuren denounced "push," "fake," and "chaos."

Finally, He Jihong from Hebei spoke amidst applause. He said that the Communist Party in North China was saying that it was "liberating" the people, but in fact it was killing the people, and that it was organizing the youth, but the youth deeply hated them. He hoped that the administrative center would be moved to the north. His words were met with fierce and prolonged applause.

Below was President Song's oral reply. This all-encompassing political problem became the liveliest program of the conference and was extended until the adjournment at 1:30 PM.

Hunan Provincial Government Mobilizes New Cadres; Grassroots in Changsha Become Sound
Our Newspaper, 14th, Airmail News, Special Correspondent Gao Yuanli from Changsha

Hunan, which people often thought about during the war, seems to have been forgotten by people after the victory. But in fact, the government authorities should pay attention to Hunan after various problems have been reviewed, in order to repay the price that Hunan paid to the country and the nation during the eight years of war.

From the winter of the 27th year, Hunan became the front line. It protected the southwest half of the country and served as a bridge to the southeast. The abundant food supported the vast military and civilian rations. If not for the defeat in Changsha in the 33rd year, Guangxi and Guizhou would not have been ravaged by the enemy. This proves its importance and also proves that its safety is linked to the safety of the country.

Difficult Situation in Southern Hunan

What is the situation now? The land that had been occupied for almost half of the province has been recovered. The people are free, but the government has suffered various constructions in Hunan during the eight years of war, which were destroyed by the Xianggui War, and has not mentioned restoration at all. As a result, transportation is broken. Only the broken and incomplete roadbeds remain of several railways. The Yuehan Railway is calling for repair every day, but the transportation volume is not as good as the highway. Shipping is even more out of the question. Only a few small tugboats of twenty or thirty tons are dragging their heavy feet on the Xiang River and Dongting Lake. Moreover, the people throughout the province are generally threatened by famine and are generally heading towards the path of death.

Hunan's surrender was in September of last year. The provincial government moved to Changsha with the national army, and has been receiving it for about half a year. The most troublesome thing is that rice prices are rising every day. The rice price at the time of reception was 5,000 yuan per stone, but by the end of the lunar year, it had risen to 20,000 yuan per stone. Around the Lantern Festival, it was even more alarming, jumping to 30,000 yuan. Although there have been several rains since then, and rice prices have fallen several times, they are still hovering around 27,000 to 28,000 yuan.

The situation in Henan is even worse. Those places are not rice-producing areas, and rice must be transported from Hunan and Changsha to provide relief. Therefore, the price of rice in Hengyang is 60,000, and in Lingling Daoxian and other places it is as high as 80,000, but there is still a market without goods. As a result, the wind of starving to death is prevalent. Almost every day people are starving to death in Lingling Qiyang and other places. As for eating grass roots and tree bark, even the liberated areas cannot avoid it.

Review of the Causes of Famine

Reviewing the causes of the famine, the destruction of the war is of course the first. Half of Hunan was occupied for only a little over a year, but the past few years of seesaw battles have all occurred in the Xiangbei and lakeside areas, which are all rich farmland areas. The losses suffered by the rural areas cannot be restored, and there is not even a chance to breathe. The plows, seeds, and farm tools are all gone. Even the simple farmhouses have all been burned down. Last year, droughts and insect plagues followed one after another, resulting in an autumn harvest of only 40% of previous years. Winter is the season for planting miscellaneous grains, but the heavens were not kind, and it was sunny for two or three months in a row, so that there was neither the possibility of sowing miscellaneous grains nor the harvest.

Secondly, the requisition of military rations is also one of the reasons for
