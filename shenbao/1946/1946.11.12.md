### Two Guangxi National Assembly Representatives Discuss Constitutional Government and Constitution

[Central News Agency, This City News] Wang Zhiyuan, Guangxi National Assembly representative and current president of Guangzhou University, and Cao Rukang, overseas Chinese National Assembly representative from Myanmar, flew to Shanghai together from Guangdong by plane at 5 p.m. on the 11th, and took the night train to Beijing to attend the National Assembly. Before the trip, they spoke to reporters from the Central News Agency about their views on constitutional government and the constitution. Wang said: The National Assembly is about to open, and the government is determined to return power to the people. People across the country are happy and celebrating together. I hope that all parties and factions can participate as scheduled and jointly promote the realization of the overall situation of peaceful unification. As for how to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, we do not want to express opinions, because they are not related to the nature of the National Assembly. Regarding the constitutional draft, we in Guangdong have conducted detailed discussions by all representatives of the Guangdong Branch of the National Assembly Representatives Friendship Association, and have completed the organization of the records, preparing to provide them to the conference for discussion. Generally speaking, the content of the May 5th Constitutional Draft is quite complete, because this constitutional draft is based on the entire spirit of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy. It has been passed through the three readings of the Legislative Yuan. In the future, it will be submitted to the General Assembly to further integrate the opinions of all parties and all representatives, and a complete Constitution of the Republic of China will surely be produced. And this constitution is more advanced than the constitutions of advanced countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. As for the first thing we should pay attention to after the future implementation of constitutional government, we believe that the first thing to pay attention to is the popularization of education, because the foundation of democratic politics lies in the development of national education. Education and politics and economics are mutually supportive and cannot be separated. Wang also said: The general public often says that "there are too many illiterate people in China." I personally think that the word "blind" is not appropriate, because there can be "martial blind" people, and even other aspects of "blindness." In fact, the so-called "illiteracy" is all because the country has failed to work hard on popularizing education in the past, and it cannot be blamed on individuals who are illiterate. It is stimulating to use the word "blind," so we must eliminate this word as soon as possible in the future so that everyone can receive education. As for the focus of future education, I personally think that we must pay attention to two points: (1) School education should be coordinated with family education and social education. Second, moral, intellectual, and physical education should be developed equally. Wang also mentioned the development of Guangzhou University in the past 20 years. It has now completed the three colleges of liberal arts, science, and business, and twelve departments. Recently, it plans to expand the College of Arts and Sciences. After going to Beijing, it will ask the Ministry of Education for instructions. Cao said: Regarding how to implement constitutional government, Cao's opinion is that there must first be a complete constitution. This constitution will be produced at this National Assembly. After the constitution is produced, the whole country must follow it consistently without exception, because the foundation of constitutional government lies in strict rule of law.

### Legislators Request the Central Government to be Listed as National Assembly Representatives, Submit Letter to the Legislative Yuan to Request Central Government Adjudication

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] 37 legislators, including Jian Guan-san and Xu Yuan-gao, submitted a letter to President Sun and Vice President Wei on the 11th, requesting that they urge the Central Government to quickly approve the matter of listing all legislators as National Assembly representatives. The original text is as follows: "There are only two ways to enact a constitution in various countries of the world: one is to submit the completed draft constitution to the people for referendum, and the other is to organize a penal law conference to discuss and enact the constitution. This National Assembly is convened specifically for the purpose of constitutional deliberation. The Legislative Yuan has drafted the constitution in the past and has been ordered to revise it later. Our colleagues in the Legislative Yuan have already shouldered half of the responsibility of constitutional deliberation, and logically become the innate representatives of the National Assembly, which is specifically for constitutional deliberation. The President is requested to urge the Central Government to approve it today, so as to facilitate the process of constitution-making, and the need for instructions is most urgent."

### Informal Military Three-Person Meeting, Government Proposes Ceasefire Measures, Communist Party Still Needs to Request Instructions and Has Not Made a Decision

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The informal military three-person meeting was held at Special Envoy Marshall's residence at 10 a.m. on the 11th. Special Envoy Marshall, Government Representative Yu Dawei (representing Xu Yongchang), Communist Party Representative Zhou Enlai, and Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, Guo, Deputy Director of the Fifth Department of the National Government, Pi Zonggan, and Xu Langxuan, Director of the Third Beauty Department of the Ministry of National Defense, and Zhang Wenjin, translator of the Communist Party Delegation, also attended the meeting. The meeting adjourned at 12 noon. At the meeting, the government representatives formally presented concrete ceasefire measures. The Communist Party representatives stated that they would need to request instructions from Yan'an before making a decision. The date for the second meeting has not been decided, but both parties can decide to convene at any time if they feel the need.

### Yan'an Has Not Yet Issued Ceasefire Order to Communist Army

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The ceasefire order issued by the government became effective at 12 noon on the 11th, but as of now, Yan'an has not issued a ceasefire order to the Communist Army. The reporter specifically visited an observer to inquire about his opinion. According to him: Stopping the conflict is a unanimous demand of the people of the whole country. After stopping the conflict, it will not only reduce the suffering of the people, but also have a good impact on politics. Therefore, the ceasefire order issued by the government this time is necessary from any point of view. However, this ceasefire order was issued by the government on its own initiative. In order to actually stop the conflict, it is necessary to negotiate with the Chinese Communists. I hope that the Chinese Communists can also order their troops to stop attacking the National Army. The government has notified Marshal and the Chinese Communist representative Zhou Enlai, and held a three-person meeting at 3 p.m. on the 11th to informally discuss the ceasefire issue. The results of the informal three-person group are not yet known. According to past regulations on ceasefire measures, it can be implemented in the following ways: First, both sides of the army will stop the conflict on the spot and wait for the three-person group to go. Second, the three-person meeting will stipulate the location for both sides to withdraw their troops. Third, if there are differences between the two sides, the three-person group will decide. The above methods were stipulated in the past, and can be handled in this way at present. However, it is not yet known whether Yan'an can express the same child on this point. If only the government army unilaterally ceases fire, and the Communist army still does not stop attacking the National Army, then the conflict will inevitably continue to occur.

### Legislative Yuan Holds Temporary Meeting to Discuss Constitutional Procedures, Plenary Review Meeting Held Tomorrow

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The Legislative Yuan held a temporary meeting on the 11th. After discussing routine cases (see the second edition for the discussion of routine cases), the meeting was adjourned for an hour and reopened at 7 p.m. to review the draft amendment to the May 5th Constitutional Draft, with Sun Ke presiding and Wang Chonghui and Wu Jingxiong in attendance. First, Sun Ke gave a speech explaining the revision process of the constitutional draft, stating that the draft amendment to the May 5th Constitutional Draft was proposed by the Constitutional Draft Review Committee of the Political Consultative Conference. When the conference was held in Chongqing, some revision opinions were provided. Later, Wang Xianhui, Lei Zhen, and Wu Jingxiong sorted out the review opinions at that time. The chairman recently wired this hospital that the National Assembly will be convened soon, and that constitution-making is the only work of the conference, instructing this hospital to expedite the review of the draft amendment to the May 5th Constitutional Draft so that it can be used for discussion at the National Assembly.

### There Are Two Opinions on Whether to Go Through Legislative Procedures

There are two opinions on whether the amendment should go through legislative procedures: First, it is considered unnecessary to go through legislative procedures, and the May 5th Constitutional Draft ten years ago can be used as a blueprint; second, it is considered that it should go through legislative procedures. According to the first method, there may be problems in the future. Due to political changes, the situation ten years ago is different from today, and the domestic situation at that time is also different from the current situation. In order to adapt to the domestic situation, the original draft needs to be substantially revised, so it must go through legislative procedures. It should be pointed out that this amendment is one case, not two cases. The chairman adopted the second proposition and wired this hospital to complete the legislative procedure for the final amendment.

### All Work to Be Completed Within This Week

The chairman had previously limited this hospital to complete this work before the 15th of this month. The current situation is slightly different, and the time can also be slightly relaxed. In any case, all the work will be completed this week. Since there is more time, we can discuss it at length. Many members of the Huai Legislative Committee did not participate in the revision work and were not very clear about the process, so Wang Xian et al. were invited to the meeting to explain. After the speech, the review procedure was discussed, whether to hold a plenary review meeting first, and then conduct group reviews. First, Liu Guanyun spoke, saying that this hospital had discussed the May 5th Constitutional Draft early, and consulted the opinions of various provinces. In the past year or two, the general public has known it in great detail. Will today's major changes cause people across the country to doubt it? In the past, drafting constitutions was based on the Five-Power Constitution, and the Three Principles of the People were promoted by the Five Powers, but the current draft amendment is nominally the Three Principles of the People and ignores the Five-Power Constitution. This is indeed a problem. Sun Ke replied that what is being discussed at the moment is the procedural issue, and requested that the speech on the content issue be suspended. Liu still spoke generously. Finally, the chairman stopped Liu's speech, and Liu angrily withdrew from the meeting. Finally, it was decided that a joint review meeting of the five committees of Finance, Economy, Military Affairs, Foreign Affairs, and Law would be held at 9 a.m. on the 13th, convened by Lin Bin, Chairman of the Legislative Affairs Committee. At that time, Wang Chonghui et al. were invited to report, and the review procedure was decided later. The meeting adjourned at about 8 p.m.

### Chen Qicai, Gu Zhenglun and Others Take Oath, Chairman Chiang Personally Bestows Seal, Encourages Efforts to Complete Revolutionary Mission

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Central Memorial Week and the inauguration ceremony of National Government member Chen Qicai and others were held at the National Government Auditorium at 9 a.m. on the 11th.

At the beginning of the ceremony, Chen Qicai, member of the National Government, Xu Kan, Accountant-General of the National Government, Gu Zhenglun, Minister of Food, Huo Baoshu, Director of the General Office of Relief and Rehabilitation, and Hang Liwu, Political Vice-Minister of Education, Tian Peilin, Permanent Vice-Minister of Education, Wen Yingxing, Chen Hong, Tang Huisun, Deputy Director of the Land Administration, Zheng Daoru, Deputy Director of the General Office of Relief and Rehabilitation, and ten other people who were on duty, entered the venue one after another. The chairman personally bestowed the seal. After the oath-takers raised their right hands to take the oath, Commissioner Zhang Ji gave a speech, saying that this newspaper has served the country for 50 years and has fought hard under the leadership of the Premier and the President. The National Assembly will be convened tomorrow, and the period of political tutelage will come to an end. Our party has established the country through many hardships, and it is not true that we are a one-party dictatorship in accordance with the spirit of the Prime Minister's will, "the world is for all." Over the years, the government has appointed many non-party members to participate in the government, which is evidence of this. Commissioner Zhang also said that the President has given us many instructions, but the two words "know shame" and "self-confidence" must be kept in mind and strictly followed. Although the Anti-Japanese War has been won, the foundation for national construction has not yet been laid. Our party comrades and the people of the country have this feeling. How should we work hard and shoulder this important mission? Our party comrades and the people of the country should all bear this responsibility. We must have the determination of self-confidence and firm belief in doctrine and strive hard. The chairman then gave a speech, exhorting the oath-takers to abide by the oath, be loyal and responsible, and finally exhorted them to work hard to carry out the two words "work together to complete the revolutionary mission." Chen Qicai, on behalf of the oath-takers, gave a reply, expressing his respectful acceptance of the instructions from the supervisor and the chairman. The ceremony took four minutes and was completed.

In the future, the Military Mediation Department will still be the supervisory ceasefire agency, and the local peace groups will be adjusted and strengthened." Currently, there are only eleven groups remaining within the borders (including Rehe). Moreover, except for the five groups in Handan, Xinxiang, Taiyuan, Qin County, and Botou, where the three parties are fully represented, the Communist Party representatives have not participated in the groups in Shijiazhuang, Nankou, Jinan, Xuzhou, Chaoyang, and Huaiyang.

### The Legislative Yuan Revises and Passes the Feast and Entertainment Tax Law; Draft Regulations on House Tax Also Revised

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, November 11th] The Legislative Yuan held its third temporary meeting at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 11th. Seventy-three legislators, including Lin Bin, Zhao Xunyu, and Liu Keshu, attended. President Sun was absent due to another meeting and was chaired by Vice President Wei Daoming.

First, the remaining cases from the 311th meeting were discussed. The most intense debate was on the Organization Regulations of the Industry and Commerce Guidance Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Lin Bin, the Chairman of the Legal System Committee, explained that the institution used very few personnel, focused on technology, and its object was only to assist private industries, so it should be allowed to be established. Chen Guyuan and others stated that they did not object, but believed that Nanjing and Shanghai were the locations of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and it seemed unnecessary to set up guidance departments in the above two places. Other construction halls and social bureaus also paid attention to guidance work, and there was no need to set up another institution. The committee members also spoke enthusiastically about whether it should be called a "Guidance Department" or maintain the original name "Supervision Department," with most opposing the use of the word "Supervision," as it would be tantamount to returning to the old path of control. As a result, the review proposal was passed, and it was still called the "Industry and Commerce Guidance Department."

The amendment of the License Tax Law also attracted attention. It was resolved that the annual tax for each small car used for business purposes should not exceed 30,000 yuan, the annual tax for large cars should not exceed 50,000 yuan, the annual tax for freight cars should be the same, the annual tax for motorcycles should not exceed 5,001 yuan, and the annual tax for rickshaws should not exceed 5,000 yuan, but tricycles can be increased to one-half. Those used for private purposes shall be taxed at one-half of those used for business purposes.

When discussing the revised Feast and Entertainment Tax Law, Situ De, Fu Tongxian, and others strongly argued for the exemption of entertainment tax on musical performances, believing that this matter was of great importance to the future of music in China and must be exempted. Some committee members also expressed dissent on the imposition of donations on entertainment not for profit. As a result, the following supplement was added to Article 4, Paragraph 1: "However, all musical performances and entertainment not for profit shall be exempt from entertainment tax." The maximum amount of entertainment tax was originally "not exceeding 50% of the original price," but the revised draft was changed to 30%. During today's meeting, it was decided to change it to 25%.

During the meeting, the exemption of house tax was also discussed in detail. For the revised Article 6, Paragraph 2 of the House Tax Regulations: "Houses for residents' own use, not exceeding three rooms per person," it was generally believed that three rooms were too many, and it was decided to change it to "not exceeding one room per person" for exemption. However, in the first paragraph, the house tax was exempted.

When discussing the revision of the Commodity Tax Regulations, in addition to resolving to exempt cosmetic taxes on five kinds of cosmetics such as vanishing cream, the words "and others designated by the Ministry of Finance" in Paragraphs (5), (9), (11), and (13) of Article 3 were either canceled to avoid abuses.

### Compilation of Passed Major Cases

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, November 11th] The cases passed by the Legislative Yuan's temporary meeting on the 11th are as follows: (1) Report of the Legal System Committee on the review of the amendment to Article 11 of the Organization Law of the Control Yuan; (2) Report of the Legal System Committee on the review of the draft Organization Regulations of the National History Museum; (3) Report of the Legal System Committee and the Economic Committee on the review of the draft Organization Regulations of the Industry and Commerce Supervision Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs; (4) Report of the Finance Committee on the review of the draft Slaughter Tax Law; (5) Report of the Finance Committee on the review of the revised Business License Tax Law; (6) Report of the Finance Committee on the review of the revised Vehicle License Tax Law; (7) Report of the Finance Committee on the review of the revised Feast and Entertainment Tax Law; (8) Report of the Finance Committee on the review of the revised House Tax Regulations; (9) Joint review by the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Legal System Committee on the case of abolishing the Regulations on the Handling of Enemy Nationals; (10) Joint report by the Military Affairs Committee and the Legal System Committee on the review of the draft Organization Regulations of the Strategic Advisory Committee; (11) Joint report by the Finance Committee and the Economic Committee on the review of the draft amendment to the Commodity Tax Regulations. Cases (1), (7), (8), (10), and (11) were passed after being amended by the General Assembly. In addition, the Civil Law Committee and the National Law Committee jointly reported on the case proposed by Committee Member Chen An and others to draft a jury system. The review result was roughly that the rule of law in our country is not yet fully developed, and the people's legal knowledge is not yet widespread. At this time, if the jury system is forcibly implemented, jurors are easily threatened by bribery and manipulation, and the result will not only fail to assist judges in judging the facts, but the judges will be restrained and dragged down by it. Therefore, the jury system seems to have more disadvantages than advantages. According to the current situation in our country, it is still difficult to implement it for a while. The case was not passed by public decision. Regarding the case of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Legal System Committee jointly reviewing the abolition of the Enemy Nationals Disposal Regulations, the review result was that the Enemy Nationals Disposal Regulations can be abolished because most of the Japanese and German nationals have been repatriated, and Italy has restored diplomatic relations. However, the Enemy Property Disposal Regulations cannot be replaced because the "Measures for Handling Enemy and Puppet Properties in Recovered Areas" promulgated by the Executive Yuan has not undergone legislative procedures. The Executive Yuan should be requested to draft the measures into draft regulations and send them to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation before approval.

### Central Government Strictly Cracks Down on Unauthorized Production and Sale of Party Flags and National Flags

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, November 11th] The government has not granted special patents for the production and sale of Party and National flags. Everyone can produce and sell them themselves according to standard sizes and colors. The Central Government has repeatedly issued strict orders to investigate the unauthorized production and sale of flags under false pretenses. It is recently learned that unscrupulous people have organized a Party and National Flag Production and Sales Headquarters in Shanghai and, under the name of the Central Propaganda Department, are selling flags in the areas of Nanjing, Shanghai, and southern Anhui. Wang Jingwei's remnants should be severely punished.

### If Sentencing for Traitors is Too Light or Too Heavy, An Application for Retrial Can Be Filed According to Law; Zhao Chen Hopes That All Parties Will Provide More Evidence

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, November 11th] In the midst of the active trial of traitors across the country, the severity of sentencing in adjudicated cases has attracted considerable attention from the people. This reporter specifically inquired about the situation of the cases already judged by the Capital High Court from the High Procuratorate and the High Court. He Zhongjin, the Director of the High Procuratorate, said: "If the prosecutor believes that the sentencing in a adjudicated case is too light or too heavy, an application for retrial can be filed according to law. Wang Wenjun, the prosecutor in charge of Wang Shijing's case, has already applied to the High Court for a retrial of Wang's case on the 8th of this month. Chen Shengzu, the prosecutor in charge of Deng Fuyu's and Pan Yugui's cases, is in the process of applying for a retrial of Deng's case and has also decided to apply for a retrial of Pan's case after receiving the judgment. The original prosecutors in charge of these three cases all believe that the sentencing was too light." Zhao Chen, the President of the High Court, told reporters: "Regarding the two main sentences in special criminal cases, namely death penalty and life imprisonment, the judgment of the High Court cannot be regarded as the final determination. After the High Court's judgment, regardless of whether the parties apply for a retrial, the court should apply for a retrial on its behalf according to law. The final determination must be decided by the Supreme Court. The High Court's judgments are based on the evidence presented by the plaintiffs and defendants. Therefore, I sincerely hope that all responsible parties will provide more evidence to assist the country in eliminating traitors to clarify right and wrong."

### After Completing His Study Tour in Europe and America, Gu Yuxiu Arrives in Beijing to Report on His Work

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, November 11th] Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Shanghai Education Bureau, who went to Europe and the United States for a study tour, has returned to China after completing his work and has come to Beijing to report on his work.

Mr. Gu spoke with reporters about the current status of atomic energy research in various countries and sincerely said that universities in Europe and the United States made great contributions to national defense science during the war. After the war, various research works are still in progress, especially the research on atomic energy, which is particularly successful. The largest atomic energy laboratory in the United States is at the California Institute of Technology, and it is headed by Professor (EO) Lawrence, who won the Nobel Prize. The world's largest atomic fissioner is placed in this room, weighing 4,000 tons and with a diameter of 184 feet. Recently, two Chinese professors have assisted Lawrence's work, one is Ren Zhigong, a radio professor at Tsinghua University, and the other is Zeng Zhaoyu, a professor at Peking University. When the US Navy conducted an atomic bomb explosion experiment on Bikini Atoll, China had two professors, Zhao Zhongyao and Wu Dayou, who went to observe and gained a lot. Second only to California's equipment is Princeton's atomic energy laboratory. Professor Lawrence hopes that China can send 30 students to study in various atomic energy laboratories in the United States. The research on atomic energy in the United Kingdom, France, and Switzerland has also had special success. According to experimental results, European and American atomic energy experts have confirmed the possibility of atomic energy being applied to construction, especially in medicine and biology.

### A Chinese Newspaper Reporter in North China Who Colluded with the Enemy, Guan Yixian, Was Sentenced to Death; Zhou Dawen Was Sentenced to Ten Years

[Central News Agency, Beiping, November 11th] Guan Yixian's case of colluding with the enemy and treason was publicly sentenced to death by the Hebei High Court today. At 2:00 PM, Wu Shenghan, the Presiding Judge of the First Criminal Division, read out the main text of the judgment to Guan Yixian and hundreds of citizens in the audience: "Guan Yixian colluded with the enemy country to plot against his own country, and is sentenced to death, deprived of public rights for life, and all property is confiscated except for what is necessary for the living of family members." At that time, the solemn atmosphere in the courtroom became more solemn. Guan Yixian turned pale, bowed his head and remained silent. After reading out the main text of the judgment, Judge Wu continued to state the reasons for the judgment: "Guan Yixian acted entirely on his own initiative during his tenure in the puppet government, propagated for the enemy, and provided information. The propaganda agency he presided over was extremely large. After the victory, he changed his attitude and assisted underground workers, but it was purely opportunistic. Even if the newspaper society he presided over had done some good deeds, it was personal benevolence and could not make up for the great fault of treason. Therefore, in legal terms, he is sentenced to the extreme penalty."

[Another Dispatch] Zhou Dawen, the former President of the North China Broadcasting Association, who colluded with the enemy, was sentenced to ten years in prison and deprived of public rights for eight years by the Hebei High Court today.

### Ding Mocun's Crimes Are Solidified: Clearly Listed in the Indictment

The Military Intelligence Bureau Requests the Death Penalty in the Transfer Order

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] The case of Ding Mocun, the ringleader of the "76th" Special Agents, was publicly prosecuted on the 11th by Chen Shengzu, the prosecutor of the Capital High Court. All documents will be transferred to the court on the 13th. Ding Mocun was among the four traitors, including Zhou Fohai, who were escorted from Chongqing to Nanjing for trial. He is the last to be publicly prosecuted. The evidence against him has been fully prepared after two months of investigation and collection. The evidence provided by the Military Intelligence Bureau is the most important. His speculative behavior after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War is not enough to cover up his crimes of harming underground workers of the central government. According to reliable sources obtained by our reporter, the Military Intelligence Bureau has explicitly requested the judicial authorities to impose the death penalty in the transfer document, in order to appease the loyal comrades who died for the country. The full text of the indictment issued by the prosecutor of the Capital High Court is recorded below:

Defendant Ding Mocun, male, 44 years old, from Changde County, Hunan Province, residing at No. 1010, Yuanyuan Road, Shanghai, serving as the head of the puppet special agents and the puppet governor of Zhejiang Province, etc.

After the conclusion of the investigation, it is deemed that prosecution is warranted. The criminal facts, evidence, and the applicable laws are stated as follows:

(Criminal Facts)

Ding Mocun was originally a member of the Chinese Kuomintang and served as the director of the Third Division of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the former Military Affairs Commission. In August of the 27th year of the Republic of China, the bureau was ordered to reorganize, and the Third Division was abolished. Ding Mocun, feeling resentful, used the excuse of going south, transferred from Hankou to Hong Kong and then to Shanghai, colluding with the Japanese invaders and betraying China. The enemy invaders also believed that Ding Mocun was originally a special agent of our central government and knew very well the organizational situation of our special agent departments and the intelligence stations set up in various places. Therefore, they utilized him to carry out the vicious plan of using special agents to control special agents. In the spring of the 28th year of the Republic of China, Wang Zhaoming, Chen Gongbo, Zhou Fohai, and other traitors, under the protection of the Japanese invaders, secretly arrived in Shanghai, advocating "peaceful nation-building," "Sino-Japanese friendship," and "East Asian co-prosperity," and promoted the peace movement. Ding Mocun was again directed by the Japanese invaders to participate in the activities and was promoted as a standing committee member of the puppet Central Executive Committee and the Minister of the Social Affairs Department of the puppet Central Party Headquarters at the Sixth Puppet National Congress of the Kuomintang. During his tenure in the puppet position, he published fallacies and misled people. He also organized the puppet Special Agents Headquarters at No. 76, Jessfield Road in Shanghai, serving as the director. He painstakingly harmed underground workers of our central government, arrested patriotic heroes, sabotaged our intelligence agencies, and obstructed resistance to the enemy, to the extreme. On March 30th of the 29th year of the Republic of China, the puppet National Government was established in Nanjing, and Ding Mocun was appointed as the Minister of Social Affairs of the puppet Executive Yuan and a member of the puppet Central Political Committee, participating in the decision-making of the puppet government's highest national policies and various traitorous decrees and treaties. In September of the 30th year, he was transferred to the Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Transportation, in the 32nd year he was transferred to the Minister of Puppet Ministry of Social Welfare, in January of the 34th year he concurrently served as the Secretary-General of the Puppet Supreme National Defense Council, in March of the same year he also concurrently served as the Deputy Supervisor of the Puppet Political Security Department, and in January of the same year he was transferred to the Governor of the Puppet Seaport Province and concurrently served as the Puppet Pacification Director stationed in Hangzhou. He implemented political orders to enslave the people in accordance with the enemy's and puppets' wishes. Also in the summer of that year, together with Nakajima Shinichi, a special agent of the Japanese invaders, he believed that the signs of the enemy's defeat were already apparent, but still wanted to create a way out after their downfall. He collected scattered soldiers and ruffians and organized a commando general team, attempting to carry out guerrilla warfare in the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang after our Allied forces landed, in order to contain the combat power of our Allied forces. After the victory, he was induced and arrested by the former Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission and escorted to the court for investigation.

(Two) Evidence and Legal Provisions

The defendant in this case, Ding Mocun, served as the director of the Puppet Special Agents Headquarters, participated in the Puppet National Government, and successively held puppet positions such as standing committee member of the Central Executive Committee, Minister of the Social Affairs Department of the Central Party Headquarters, Minister of the Social Affairs Department of the Executive Yuan, member of the Central Political Committee, Minister of the Ministry of Transportation, Minister of the Ministry of Social Welfare, Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council, Deputy Supervisor of the Political Security Department, and Governor of Zhejiang Province and concurrently stationed in Hangzhou, Pacification Director, etc., he repeatedly confessed without denial. In addition, the puppet Administrative Gazette of the investigated case records the defendant's attendance at various meetings in the capacity of a puppet minister, as well as the records of the puppet Central China Current Situation published in Showa 17, and the Commemorative Album of the Return of the Puppet National Government to the Capital, which publishes the defendant's various speeches, all of which are consistent with his confession, and the facts are extremely clear. The special agent agencies under the puppet National Government were puppet organizations manufactured by the enemy country, Japan, and their sole purpose was to undermine our country's war resistance policy and subvert our central government. The defendant was originally a member of the Chinese Kuomintang and served as a senior central government official. At the critical moment when the situation of the War of Resistance turned against us, he actually used excuses to leave, betray his oath and collude with the enemy, plotting against our nation. He served as a key member of the enemy's puppet special agents and puppet government, harming underground workers of our central government, implementing the enemy's and puppets' political orders, and reducing our strength in the War of Resistance. This is not only evidenced by the telegram of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission but also by the detailed confessions of the defendant Hu Junhe in another case, which is sufficient to prove it. Moreover, in his New Year's speech in the 33rd year, he also said: "Restoring China and defending East Asia cannot be achieved by mere optimism, but must be exchanged with iron and blood. Although we have invested a lot of manpower and material resources, we cannot be satisfied. The advance troops have not yet reached the strength to fight shoulder to shoulder with friendly forces. In the past year, the government has been actively training troops, building an army, and intensifying the training of young people, all for the purpose of preparing to fight shoulder to shoulder, destroy the United States and Britain, and implement the 'Greater East Asia War.' I hope that the people of the country can understand this. The more strength we have, the more hope we have for the revival of China. The more strength we invest, the more certainty we have of winning the 'Greater East Asia War.' Only with the overall victory of the 'Greater East Asia War' can the entire East Asian nation be truly liberated. We must work together under this understanding," and other similar fallacious words, which are too numerous to mention. His treacherous acts of colluding with the enemy and plotting rebellion are already obvious. Moreover, in the summer of the 34th year, when the signs of the enemy's defeat were already clearly revealed, he still colluded with Nakajima Shinichi, a special agent of the Japanese invaders, and secretly planned to organize a commando general team, attempting to carry out guerrilla warfare after our Allied forces landed in the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang, in order to contain the combat power of the Allied forces and delay the enemy's collapse, wanting to plunge the people in our war zone into dire straits. Although the defendant vehemently denied this during the interrogation, the facts are very clear based on Nakajima Shinichi's confession in the war crimes military tribunal and Chen Gongshu's report to the Military Intelligence Bureau. The defendant's empty words cannot be used to deny it. From this point of view, his crimes are heinous and cannot be condoned. Although the defendant claimed: (1) He participated in the puppet organization under the coercion of the enemy puppets, but his heart was still towards the central government; (2) In the spring of the 31st year, he entrusted someone to surrender to the central government on his behalf to clarify his intentions; (3) He secretly communicated with the central military and political authorities, established secret radio stations, provided military information to the army, reorganized the puppet army to cooperate with the national army, in order to counterattack, rescue underground workers of the central government, and assist the central government in developing culture and party affairs in the occupied areas; (4) During his tenure, he preserved postal rights, maintained postal and remittance services, improved roads, eliminated corruption and darkness in transportation, worked hard for social welfare, reduced the suffering of the people, cultivated agricultural talents, benefited rural areas, and wiped out bandits to stabilize the local area; (5) After the Japanese invaders surrendered, the defendant followed the central government's instructions to maintain the security of the occupied areas of Zhejiang and the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. When the national army entered Hangzhou, he handed over all the military power under his command to the central government for takeover, which was not without some merit, etc., using these as excuses for exemption from guilt. However, after investigation, (1) his so-called coercion by the enemy puppets is purely empty talk and cannot be adopted. Moreover, he continued to serve in puppet positions for more than six years, and he was transferred to important positions many times. He did not remain untainted and retire to clarify his intentions. It is obvious that he did not act out of coercion. (2) After the defendant joined the rebellion, the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office had already issued a wanted order on October 2, 28th year. Even if the defendant had entrusted someone to surrender to the central government on his behalf in the spring of the 31st year, it does not meet the conditions for surrendering, which requires automatic surrender to the authorities after the crime is discovered and being subject to trial. Therefore, it cannot be used as a reason for reducing guilt. He colluded with the enemy, presided over special agents, harmed patriots, opposed the war, was pro-Japanese, and betrayed the central government. His crimes are obvious and unforgivable. Even if he had contact with the central military and political authorities and rescued underground workers, it was because he saw that the international situation was clearly unfavorable to the Japanese invaders after the outbreak of the Pacific War. It was nothing more than leaving a way out for himself, hoping to cover up his past mistakes. How can this be used as favorable evidence to seek leniency? (4) The defendant's so-called maintenance of postal and remittance services, improvement of roads, and stabilization of security during his tenure are baseless claims. Even if they were true, they were the duties that should be fulfilled in the puppet position. How can this be used to claim credit? As for the various welfare matters he did for the benefit of the people, although many details are listed, it is still doubtful whether they are real. Even if they are not false, they are only occasional small favors to obedient people. How can small favors cover up his great sins? (5) After the Japanese invaders surrendered, the defendant maintained local security, assisted the central government in taking over, and handed over all the military power under his command. This has indeed been stated by the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission in the transfer document. However, this was only because the Japanese invaders had already surrendered, and the puppet organization lost its support. The defendant, seeing that the general trend was gone, had no choice but to submit. What merit is there to speak of! In summary, all of the above defenses are attempts to conceal the truth and reduce the sentence. They are not acceptable. His actions constitute a crime under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. Therefore, in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a direct public prosecution is filed, and you are requested to conduct a trial in accordance with the law.

### Editorial: Redouble Our Efforts to Fulfill Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Legacy

Today, when the domestic political situation is at a historical juncture, we once again celebrate the birthday of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Regarding the birth of this national leader, our founding father, and his lifelong struggle, we consider today's situation and feel a multitude of emotions. We truly do not know where to begin with our countless words. The national revolution led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen during his lifetime was a revolution of the Three Principles of the People. Due to his effective leadership and the rise of patriots, he finally overthrew the Qing Dynasty, established the Republic of China, and completed the initial stage of the Three Principles of the People's national revolution. However, the remnants of feudalism persisted, forming a situation of warlord separatism. The achievements of the Xinhai Revolution were almost completely abandoned in an instant. Fortunately, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's struggle rekindled the high tide of the national revolution and launched a fierce battle with the remaining feudal forces. In the autumn of the 13th year of the Republic of China, the situation in the north changed, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen went to the old capital to promote peaceful unification and democratic nation-building. Unfortunately, he passed away from illness, and the people of the whole country suddenly lost their leader. On his deathbed, he was still deeply concerned about national affairs, instructing us to work together with the nations that treat us equally, to abolish unequal treaties, and to convene a national assembly. Today, President Chiang Kai-shek has inherited Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy, eliminating the remaining feudal forces in the country, leading our nation in the War of Resistance against Japan, and achieving victory. He has also abolished unequal treaties and re-signed equal new treaties with countries such as Britain and the United States. Thanks to President Chiang Kai-shek's wise leadership, many of the instructions given to us by Dr. Sun Yat-sen have now been fulfilled one by one. We thank the arrangement of the Almighty God that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's unfinished great cause can have such a wise leader, such as President Chiang Kai-shek, to turn them into reality one by one. Today, on the occasion of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday, we respectfully report this to the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in heaven.

Today is also an important turning point in our nation's history. The National Assembly, which was postponed several times and decided to be held today, has been postponed again to the 15th. The convening of the National Assembly should have been realized long ago, but it was delayed due to the intensified aggression of the Japanese militarists, which eventually led to the outbreak of the War of Resistance. At that time, our country was fighting bitterly against the enemy, but some people insisted on convening the National Assembly. President Chiang Kai-shek, in order to respect the opinions of all parties, made a promise to convene the National Assembly within one year. It was a established policy for the government to return power to the people and implement constitutional government. Since the Communist Party and some other parties had requested the convening of the National Assembly, it was natural to be happy to accept it under the improved war situation. After Japan surrendered and the government returned to the capital, it was postponed to May of this year. During this period, in order to implement the goal of peaceful unification, the government earnestly negotiated with various parties, repeatedly requesting them to submit the list of members of the National Government and representatives to the National Assembly as scheduled, so that the reorganization of the National Government and the convening of the National Assembly could be held as scheduled. However, it was postponed until April 25th, and the Communist Party still refused to nominate, so it had to be postponed again. The government announced on July 4th that the National Assembly would be postponed to November 12th. The convening of the National Assembly was delayed until today, mainly due to the Communist Party's delay and deliberate obstruction, which is obvious. Recently, the ceasefire orders requested by some parties have also been issued with great forbearance by the government. However, the opening ceremony, which was originally scheduled to be held on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday today, has been postponed again for the last time to the 15th of this month.

What we need today is peaceful unification and democratic construction. The convening of the National Assembly should be a manifestation of peaceful unification and the beginning of democratic construction. In the 13th year of the Republic of China, Dr. Sun Yat-sen went to the old capital at the expense of his health in order to achieve peaceful unification. This spirit of sacrifice and selflessness should move every Chinese person. What we need today is also sacrifice and selflessness. People from all parties and factions, as well as non-party people, should abandon their personal interests to jointly participate in this National Assembly that represents the public opinion of the people. In this way, our country's fundamental law can be passed by the whole people, implemented in the future, embark on the path of constitutional government, and permanently prevent domestic political disputes. The representatives to this National Assembly are legally produced through regional and occupational elections, and are directly selected by the National Government, which can represent the public opinion of the general public. However, what we earnestly hope is that all parties and factions, as well as non-party people, can participate and jointly plan national affairs.

The convening of the National Assembly is for the purpose of formulating a constitution, and after the constitution is formulated, it will be implemented. The Three Principles of the People that Dr. Sun Yat-sen left us is no longer the private property of one party, but the public property of China. Therefore, the formulation of this constitution should be a concrete manifestation of the spirit of the Three Principles of the People. The theory of power and ability and the framework of the Five-Power Constitution should be clearly stipulated in the constitution formulated this time, and those that violate the spirit of the Three Principles of the People should be discarded. In this way, after the constitution is formulated and implemented in the future, the government can fulfill its long-cherished wish to return power to the people and China will embark on the road of democratic politics. And today, we should especially commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen by redoubling our efforts to fulfill and promote his legacy.

### Automobile Accident in Wuxi

[Our Wuxi Dispatch] Since the victory, there have been a large number of cars in the county, but the streets are narrow, so major disasters often occur.

### University Student Xu Yongqing Swindles Everywhere, Arrested in Wuxi

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi] Xu Yongqing, a native of Changshu, is 29 years old and a graduate of Southwest Associated University. He once worked at the Kunming Central Electrical Equipment Factory. After the victory, he declared himself unemployed. Later, due to repeated offenses, he was wanted by the Kunming authorities. Unable to gain a foothold in Kunming, Xu traveled everywhere, making a living by deceiving people. He has committed dozens of crimes in Taiwan, Shanghai, Suzhou, and other places. On August 3rd of this year, Xu suddenly came to Wuxi and defrauded Wan Yuecheng, the wife of Major General Hu Xianzhi, the commander of the 1st Battalion of the 25th Army Officer Corps, of a large amount of property. Hu serves in Zhengzhou, while Wan is a local resident and currently resides with her mother in Wuxi. His method of fraud is all-pervasive. Sometimes, he tries to detect the secrets of letters sent from afar, and then goes to the destination, using flowery words and eloquent speech, so that the victims invariably believe him. On the afternoon of the 9th, at around 2 PM, Xu was talking with a local youth, Zhang Yan, at the Wanfang Building in Longtouzhu, discussing his plans to go to Taiwan. Unexpectedly, Hu Xianzhi and his wife were also visiting the area and spotted him. They immediately grabbed him. Zhang and Xu know each other, being introduced by his relative, Mi Xueying. Mi has a boyfriend named Yu Yuanzhao, who is currently studying at National Taiwan University. His father is currently the accounting director of the Bank of Taiwan. Recently, Xu also learned the contents of the letters between Yu and Mi, and then went to Mi's house, contacting Xueying. He claimed to be the business director of the Bank of Taiwan and a colleague of Yu's father, inviting Mi to go to Taiwan to work and meet Yu, etc. Mi was unable to leave Wuxi, so she introduced Zhang Yan to go to Taiwan. But the net of heaven is vast, and he was spotted by the Hu couple. He has now been handed over to the police for investigation.

### Anhui Adjusts County-Level Salaries, Decides on Thrift Measures Due to Financial Deficit

[Our Newspaper, Hefei] Since the financial reform in Anhui Province, expenditures have exceeded income by more than 2 billion yuan.

(2) All district offices that were restored due to environmental needs in the province a month ago will be abolished starting in January of the 36th year [1947]. All responsibilities for suppressing bandits and maintaining security will be concurrently assumed by the nearby township chiefs. (3) Starting in January of the 31st year [1942], guaranteed salary and public grain will be exempt from payment. Furthermore, because county-level salaries are too low, incumbents cannot make a living, and those who have not been appointed view it as a daunting task, the standing committee also decided to adjust them: (1) Living allowance of 55,000 yuan per month, (2) Salary multiplied by 240.

### Righteous Deeds of Villagers

Farmland Seized During the War, Redeemed Today to Help Education

[Our Newspaper, Fengxian] Xie Hesheng, from Taiping Township in this county, had four mu of good farmland in Wuqiao Township before the Anti-Japanese War. During the occupation, Shen Yutao, relying on the power of the enemy and puppets, forcibly bought it. After the victory, the government announced land consolidation rules, stipulating that land forcibly occupied by enemy and puppet forces during the occupation period could be redeemed according to law, and the person who forcibly occupied it must compensate for all losses during the period of forced occupation. Therefore, Xie's children submitted a petition to the county government, stating the details and voluntarily donating the redeemed farmland to local education funds. County Magistrate Xi investigated and verified the facts, approved Xie's redemption, and then donated the land to help education. After public auction by Township Chief Xie Yunhai and others, a total of sixteen dan of white rice was obtained, which was distributed fairly by County Magistrate Xi. The two elementary schools in Wuqiao and Taiping each received six dan of white rice, and the remainder was distributed by the donors to institutions for the care of needy children. As for the compensation for losses during the period of forced occupation, the original agreement was waived after mediation.

### Financial Difficulties in Various Counties of Northern Jiangsu

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 11th] The provincial government, due to limited funds, only provided 16 million yuan per month for the first three months of administrative maintenance expenses after the recovery of the counties in the recovered areas of northern Jiangsu. However, the actual monthly needs of the counties are currently more than 50 million yuan. It is reported that after the Gao You and Baoying county governments were restored, one month's maintenance expenses were used up in ten days. Xinghua and Dongtai are even more miserable. In the future, in addition to relying on loans, the county governments will have to resort to the old trick of reaching out to the people again. However, the existing property of the people in the recovered areas is only barren land and worthless counterfeit currency, so it is impossible to apportion the burden. Therefore, officials and people in the recovered areas are busy borrowing money every day, and nothing can be done.

### Watching a Play, Boat Capsizes, More Than Fifty People Drown

### Household Relocation Certificate Missing

Since the last time there was limited-price sugar to buy, it took so much time and effort to get two catties of Taiwan sugar. (Some people didn't get any.) Now, there's no need to spend effort or time. With a household registration card or national identity card, you can get a sugar ration certificate based on the number of people. This is great news for us, and the sugar purchase certificate was also issued by the Baojia chief a couple of days ago according to the population. However, one thing we don't understand is that we originally lived at No. 180 Henan North Road (Section 16, Bao 9, Jia 23), but moved here last month (No. 55 Dexing Lane, Tanggu Road, Section 16, Bao 32, Jia 10). But because of the move, even the sugar coupons are gone. We went to inquire with the current Jia chief why we didn't have a sugar purchase certificate issued. The Jia chief said, "The higher-ups (referring to the Bao chief) said that only those who moved in before August would get them." So, we went to the old residence Jia chief, who said, "The household registration has been reported, it's not under their management, so naturally there's no sugar purchase certificate." So, where did our family's several sugar purchase coupons go? Who should we get them from? Is it possible that because of the move, even the slightest right to enjoy is revoked? This really baffles us. (Tang Jinyi)

### Counting Cash on the Spot at the Bank

On the 31st of last month, I was ordered by the manager to go to a certain bank at Jiangxi Road, Jiujiang Road to withdraw 2 million yuan in cash. The teller of the bank paid me four bundles of cash, each bundle being 500,000 yuan. The teller also told me, "This money has been recounted and is accurate." After I received it, I first checked each of the two bundles one by one, and they were indeed correct. At that time, it was past 11:15, and I was limited by the long return journey, and thinking that the two bundles I had counted were very accurate, I thought the rest would be correct too, so I immediately got in the car and returned. In the afternoon, my colleagues and I counted the two bundles of cash that had not been checked, only to find that one bundle was short 5,000 yuan, and the other bundle was short 10,000 yuan. It was already half past three, and it was too late to go and negotiate with the bank. I could only admit my bad luck. Fortunately, the manager understood, otherwise I would have suffered injustice without being able to speak out. According to the bank's practice, each bundle of cash has a paper strip sealed at the top, with the name of the counter and the package number 12119 attached. However, there were actually cases of 3,000 yuan being counted as 10,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan being counted as 10,000 yuan, and 7,000 yuan being counted as 10,000 yuan, causing me to suffer this inexplicable loss. This is a byproduct of the inflation of legal tender. I hope that those who withdraw money will be meticulous in the future. (Cai Heming)

### Broken Street Lights Can Be Reported for Repair

This column published a letter from residents of Bansongyuan Road stating that there were no street lights between Gaochang Temple and Chenjiaqiao. Now we have received a letter from the Public Utilities Bureau stating: "The restoration of street lights in areas such as Hunan is actively being carried out by the Bureau. However, due to the lack of materials needed for the electrical companies to install poles and wires, the work is inevitably affected. We are currently urging them to restore and install them as much as possible within this year. As for the Bansongyuan area, we have sent workers to install 31 street lights." Also, reader Zhou Zanyang wrote a letter stating concerns about street lights. The Public Utilities Bureau replied, "The street light at No. 3148 Fujian North Road has been notified to the Shanghai Electric Power Company for repair. We are now reviewing the attached telephone list for reporting street light repairs, which was established by the Bureau. In the future, if you encounter a broken street light, you can directly report it by phone." A telephone list is enclosed and published here.

According to the opinions expressed by various sectors in this column on the issue of street lights in this city, the Public Utilities Bureau has adopted and improved them, which is already evident. There are also similar statements from Xu Wenli and others, please refer to this for reference.

### Results of French General Election Announced, People's Republican Movement Comes in Second, Division of Right-Wing Parties is Reason for Communist Party's Victory

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] Political observers say that the main reason for the Communist Party's victory in yesterday's general election was the division within the right-wing parties. The right-wing was divided into many small parties, so no one party received enough votes to compete with the Communist Party. In the last Constituent Assembly election, the People's Republican Movement was originally stronger than the Communist Party, but it lost a large number of supporters due to the breakaway of the de Gaulle faction, and its strength was weakened. The Socialist Party was divided into left and right wings. The right wing joined the more moderate parties, including the People's Republican Movement; the left wing joined the Left Union. Therefore, the Socialist Party is declining day by day.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] The Ministry of the Interior announced the official figures for the new congressional elections tonight as follows: (1) "Number of Voters" 25,830,000 registered in mainland France, 19,578,000 voters, and 19,216,000 valid votes.

### Communist Party Prepares to Take Responsibility for Forming a Cabinet, But Will Still Adopt a Multiparty System

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] Although the Communist Party won the French general election yesterday, its strength is still dispersed among the major parties. The new cabinet is likely to adopt a multi-party system, similar to the three-party cabinet system since the liberation of France. Communist Party spokesman Pond told reporters last night, "The Communist Party is ready to take responsibility." Political observers believe that this statement is premature, because in a coalition cabinet, it is not easy for the Communist Party to implement its platform. In short, the birth of the new government is still three months away. During this period, the situation will change a lot, especially the Council of State of the second house of Congress will be elected on the 24th of this month, and the situation at that time may be even more subtle.

However, officials from the Ministry of the Interior believe that the number of voters will definitely increase before the end. Cadres of various parties, feeling that the public is indifferent to this election, are using newspapers to vigorously appeal. The People's Republican Movement led by President Bidault is deeply concerned that the lack of voter participation will allow the Communist Party to benefit.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 10th] General elections were held throughout France and its overseas territories today, and the situation was generally good. It was only reported that several election lists in a small town in the northern province of Nord suddenly disappeared, and the police authorities are currently investigating. Interim President and Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Piche was voting in the seventh arrondissement. The President was late until 2 PM, and immediately lined up behind an old woman to vote in order.

[United Press, Paris, 10th] According to sources from French personnel today: President of the Provisional Government of Southern Vietnam, Nguyễn Văn Thinh, was depressed after the cabinet resigned and hanged himself at his private residence in Saigon. The doctor certified that it was suicide.

[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 10th] French and Southern Vietnamese people here have expressed their condolences upon hearing the news of the suicide of the President of the Provisional Government of Southern Vietnam, saying that the President had recently been criticized by some Southern Vietnamese people and newspapers, accusing his government of lacking effectiveness.

### Twenty-One New American Ships to Join the Fleet Next Spring, State-of-the-Art Equipment Adapts to Modern Warfare

[United Press, Washington, 10th] Five newly built American cruisers, and six destroyers and submarines each, will join the American fleet in the next five months. The construction of some of these ships will be designed according to wartime experience, including the largest caliber (six to eight inches) automatic guns, firing at a rate almost equal to machine guns. The cruisers are larger than previous battleships of the same class, and some are actually comparable to older battleships. The construction of each ship began at the end of the war. Other battleship styles were more outdated and have been abandoned. These new warships will one day be incorporated with the new ships that have already been launched to form an American fleet in the transitional period between the "present fleet" and the "atomic fleet of tomorrow." At the same time, naval authorities will advance the development of future battleships, starting with the 45,000-ton rocket-launching battleship "Kentucky" and the battlecruiser "Hawaii".

### International Conference Stalemate Affected by French Elections: Four Foreign Ministers Discuss Romanian Oil Rights, US Engaging in Behind-the-Scenes Activities on Veto Issue

[Our Own Dispatch] Paris, 11th - French government announced today: France intends to suggest to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference that discussions regarding the future of Germany be postponed until January of next year. This request is a result of the victory of the French Communist Party in yesterday's elections.

[United Press, New York, 11th] Diplomatic circles here today speculated that the Communist Party's victory in the French parliamentary elections may alter the balance of power in the Four Foreign Ministers Conference and the United Nations. Whenever contentious issues arise, France does not often side with the United States and Britain, but on major issues, it supports the decisions of the United States and Britain more than those of the Soviet Union. If the balance of power changes in the future, the situation in which the Soviet Union often fails to gain the support of other countries will no longer occur, and it will further prevent Britain and the United States from repeatedly issuing calls for "veto power" against the Soviet Union. US diplomatic circles believe that Soviet foreign policy has recently become more accommodating due to strong opposition. The French election may also affect Soviet foreign policy. Meanwhile, the Four Foreign Ministers have resumed their meetings after resting on Saturday and Sunday. The most important issue currently being drafted for the European peace is the Danube River issue.

[Our Own Dispatch] San Francisco, 11th - Starting this week, US representatives will engage in important side meetings, holding separate negotiations with the other four major powers in order to reach an agreement on the Security Council's veto power issue. It is reported that in response to the movement by various small countries to abolish the veto power, the US representatives have drafted a specific plan, hoping to insert greater flexibility into the voting procedure regulations of the Security Council without changing the principles of the Charter.

[Reuters, New York, 10th] When the Foreign Ministers Conference meets tomorrow, it will consider the proposals for the Romanian peace treaty. The most important of these is the British suggestion to include in the peace treaty clauses regarding foreign oil rights in Romania. The content includes four articles: (1) Romania should restore all oil industry properties belonging to the United Nations; (2) Romania should compensate these oil industries for losses and necessary repairs incurred during the war; (3) The Romanian government should amend its 1942 Petroleum Law, which discriminates against nationals of the United Nations; (4) Romania should allow technical experts to freely enter Romania to work in the oil industries owned by nationals of the United Nations. Among these, the first, second, and fourth articles were not adopted by the Paris Peace Conference, while the third article was passed by a simple majority. The US and the Soviet Union both voted against all four articles, while France opposed the fourth article. When the Foreign Ministers Conference re-discusses this matter tomorrow, there is little hope of it being passed. However, since the Soviet Union has repeatedly raised matters that were not passed by the Paris Peace Conference in this Foreign Ministers Conference, Britain will also continue to propose the four articles regarding Romanian oil rights at the Foreign Ministers Conference.

### Hungary Expresses Dissatisfaction with Treaty

[Agence France-Presse, Hungarian Capital, 10th] It has been learned that the Hungarian Minister to the United States, Masirek, has submitted a note from his country to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, stating that the drafting of the Hungarian peace treaty by the Paris Peace Conference did not follow the principles for minority issues outlined in the Atlantic Charter and the United Nations Charter, which is regrettable.

### UN Headquarters Location in America: Selection Scope Expanded

[Our Own Dispatch] San Francisco, 11th - The Soviet Union's proposal to move the United Nations headquarters to Geneva has failed.

[Reuters, London, 11th] Authoritative sources say: Three companies of troops are stationed in London today, ready to cooperate with the police at any time to prevent riots by Jewish terrorists. Tomorrow is the day the parliament begins its sessions, and the British King will attend to deliver a speech. The authorities will be on the highest level of alert.

[Reuters, London, 11th] A "Daily Mail" reporter claims: Jewish terrorists issued a warning last night, saying that if the British government does not change its Palestine policy, they will kill Field Marshal Montgomery and bomb the British War Office. This morning, the police station sent out a large number of detectives to investigate foreigners in London and other places. Recently, members of the Stern Gang, a Jewish terrorist group, secretly infiltrated Britain. According to a "News Chronicle" reporter in Jerusalem, after receiving threats, British embassies in the capitals of France and Italy have selected detectives from the Palestinian police to go to protect them.

Irgun Intensifies Anti-British Activities

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 11th] The secret radio station of the Jewish terrorist group Irgun broadcast the group's "communique," stating that any precautionary measures taken by British people or British embassies outside Palestine are insufficient to prevent Irgun soldiers from completing their missions.

Electricity Workers Go on Hunger Strike

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th Dispatch] The common front to adopt a "winter offensive" against the Yoshida government is rapidly forming. The electricity workers' union is in contact with Japan's two major labor unions to launch a joint offensive. The National Labor League, which controls 80% of organized labor under the control of the National Industrial Organization Association, and most other independent unions have agreed to support this movement to overthrow the government, which is said to be biased towards capitalists.

[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 11th] The labor strike at the Tokyo Shibaura Electric Factory has been going on for 40 days. Today, some young activists are going on a hunger strike as a tough means to achieve their demands.

### Japanese Labor Front Unites: Plans to Launch Offensive to Overthrow Cabinet, Parties Step Up Activities as Local Elections Near

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 11th] As the Japanese local council elections and the elections for the Privy Council (replacing the old House of Peers) approach, various parties are stepping up their activities. The merger of the Liberal and Progressive parties is almost complete, but there are still a few issues that need to be resolved. One of the issues is who will be the leader of the new party. The Liberal Party is hesitant to nominate a leader. Prime Minister Yoshida (President of the Liberal Party) is prepared to reach an understanding with former Prime Minister Shidehara (President of the Progressive Party), but the Liberal Party headquarters is still influenced by former President Hatoyama. Although Hatoyama was purged by MacArthur, his remaining influence still exists, and the relationship between Shidehara and Hatoyama is still not good. On the other hand, there is a lack of unity within the Socialist Party. Its real strength lies in its influence on the working class, and the working masses have now organized labor unions. The Socialist Party has various opportunities to strengthen its own strength in future elections. There is currently no possibility of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party forming a People's Front.

### High Prices in Tokyo: Monthly Income Only Enough to Buy One Pair of Leather Shoes

[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 12th] Prices in Tokyo are soaring daily, and the general salaried class is unable to make ends meet, feeling extremely distressed, leading to repeated labor strikes, which the government is unable to cope with. According to a survey by the Tokyo Police Department's Life Information Division, the black market price of rice is rising by 55 yen and 6 kaku (equivalent to 2 Chinese sheng) per day. The ordinary family ration of rice is only enough for 20 days, and for the remaining 10 days, they rely on black market rice. The monthly income of ordinary civil servants and staff is only 500 to 700 yen, and the income of laborers is 700 to 1000 yen, so they have to replace the white rice they need with coarse grains. An egg costs 6 yen and 5 kaku, a pair of men's leather shoes costs 650 to 700 yen, and a pound of brown sugar costs 1500 yen.

### Calculating China: Better Than a Computer

Matsuzaki used an abacus, and Hoot used a computer. As a result, Matsuzaki was victorious. Hoot only won in multiplication. Matsuzaki won in addition, subtraction, division, and the final comprehensive arithmetic problems using all four operations.

### The Dutch Do Not Forget Friends in Need: Express Gratitude for Assistance from Overseas Chinese

[Our Own Dispatch] Recently, many Dutch people in Bangka Island, Dutch East Indies, who had been detained in Japanese concentration camps, held a meeting and unanimously agreed to express their gratitude to the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies for their assistance to the Dutch during the period of occupation. The initiator was Amsden, who hoped that the Dutch government would not forget "friends in need." The crowd cheered in agreement. During the period when the Japanese controlled the area, anyone who privately communicated with the Dutch would be subjected to cruel treatment once discovered, which the overseas Chinese were well aware of. However, there were still many overseas Chinese throughout the Dutch East Indies who secretly assisted the Dutch. Clothes and food were still transported to the concentration camps at risk, so the Dutch were deeply grateful. After the victory, the overseas Chinese were very interested in the development of the Dutch East Indies' economy and industry. The overseas Chinese in the Dutch Borneo, Celebes Island, and Bangka Island were particularly active. Recently, the Dutch government convened a meeting in Marina Town, Celebes Island, to discuss political, financial, and economic issues. The overseas Chinese also actively participated. Among those attending from various ports were Mr. Zhang Tiancong and others.

### Xu Xueyu Discusses Maintaining Pier Order: Thoroughly Eradicating Bad Habits and Establishing a New Atmosphere; Urges Maximum Reporting of Extortion and Malpractice

The theft of goods and extortion at Shanghai port piers and warehouses has already aroused criticism from Chinese and foreign merchants, as well as the attention of the government's Standing Committee. The newly established Shanghai Port Reorganization Committee has repeatedly discussed this issue, agreed on measures, and is strictly implementing them for rectification. According to Xu Xueyu, General Manager of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: since the resumption of operations last year, China Merchants has been determined to rectify the atmosphere and order of the piers and warehouses, and has worked hard to do so. However, due to deeply ingrained habits, the expected results have not yet been achieved. In the future, efforts will continue to thoroughly eradicate decades of bad habits and establish a new atmosphere. Xu also stated: the poor order of Shanghai's piers is due to the past system of dock management monopolized by evil social forces. These evil forces, either through coercion or bribery, would secure a loading and unloading position at a pier and treat it as their personal territory. They would extort merchants and exploit laborers as much as possible, reaping huge profits without laboring. Therefore, they often resorted to various despicable means to compete for territory, even resorting to fighting and bloodshed. After the company moved its office to Shanghai last year, it decided to first abolish the monopoly system and adopt a supervisory system. The aim was to establish a direct relationship between the company and the laborers who actually worked and sweated, ensuring they received all the wages they deserved, preventing contractors from exploiting them, thereby improving the laborers' treatment and increasing their work efficiency and service integrity. Although some progress has been made in the past year, deeply ingrained habits and the laborers' lack of knowledge often led to the supervisory system soon resembling the contractor system again, with various malpractices arising as a result. The company has dismissed and replaced several pier supervisors due to the aforementioned abuses. Employees in charge of each pier who were found to be colluding with supervisors in malpractice were also immediately dismissed, without any leniency. In the future, the company itself will adhere to its original intention and strive to improve as much as possible. At the same time, it is hoped that the Port Reorganization Committee will effectively implement its resolutions, and especially that all sectors of society will provide assistance. If anyone, from responsible personnel to loading and unloading laborers at the company's piers, fails to comply with the company's regulations and engages in arbitrary extortion or embezzlement, please provide responsible reports with solid evidence to the company. The company is determined to deal with them severely and will be responsible for protecting the rights and interests of the informants. Cooperation from all relevant parties is essential to achieve results and prevent these evil forces from using their skills, ultimately leading to their demise. Furthermore, regarding the practice of "tip money," its origin was actually due to merchants voluntarily adding extra money to the stipulated wages in order to expedite the delivery of goods, which later became a customary practice. Therefore, the company sincerely hopes that merchants will pay according to the company's regulations in the future and avoid creating bad precedents by seeking temporary convenience.

### Registration of Land for British Overseas Chinese Property Owners Begins Today; British Consul Visited Director Zhu Yesterday to Discuss the Arrangements

Regarding the registration of land rights and land value tax for British overseas Chinese in Shanghai, Mayor Wu and Director Zhu have repeatedly consulted with the British Consul, and have agreed on principles and various details based on Chinese laws and the actual situation of British overseas Chinese. At 10 AM yesterday, British Consul John Reeves visited Director Zhu of the Land Administration Bureau again to discuss the implementation procedures. The result was quite satisfactory, and ten measures were established, which are excerpted below:

(1) If the registered owner of the land is a British person, but the actual rights belong to a Chinese person, the Chinese owner who holds a "daoqi" (official deed) or a "quanbingdan" (title deed) should directly apply for registration with the Land Administration Bureau. The Land Administration Bureau should promptly list the name of the British registered owner, the name of the Chinese beneficial owner, and the number of the canceled "daoqi" and notify the British Consulate. (2) "Daoqi" or "quanbingdan" issued by Japanese or puppet organizations cannot be used as proof of property rights. (3) The procedure for British overseas Chinese property owners to apply for land registration is as follows: First, the British overseas Chinese property owner should submit the "daoqi" to the British Consulate and fill out a sworn statement, declaring that they are the true owner. After the consulate authorities approve it, they will provide a certificate. Second, the British overseas Chinese property owner should submit the aforementioned certificate, along with the "daoqi," to the Land Administration Bureau to apply for a land ownership certificate. Third, British overseas Chinese who hold other deeds such as "fangdan" (square deed), "tiandan" (field deed), "quanbingdan," and receipts for registration applied for before the war, should submit them to the British Consulate and fill out a sworn statement, declaring that they are the true owner. After the consulate authorities approve it, they will provide a certificate, and the owner will submit the aforementioned deeds and certificate to the Land Administration Bureau. After verification, the Land Administration Bureau will issue a land ownership certificate. (4) The Land Administration Bureau will not charge any fees for British overseas Chinese property owners to apply for registration and exchange land ownership certificates. (5) For British overseas Chinese property transfers before the signing of the new Sino-British Treaty on May 20, 1943, the Land Administration Bureau will waive the transfer registration fee. (6) British overseas Chinese property owners must pay land tax in accordance with Chinese land law. (7) When applying for registration, British overseas Chinese property owners may submit the original "daoqi" and its photo to the Land Administration Bureau. After verification, the original "daoqi" will be returned to the original owner. (8) Land that is not owned by a legal entity may be registered in the name of the legal representative. (9) Land registration for British overseas Chinese property owners in Shanghai will begin today. (10) Further discussions will be held if other difficulties arise.

[Another report] The implementation measures for the land registration of American overseas Chinese have already been agreed upon. Regarding the regulations on the permission of land ownership for the Chinese people by the United States, the provisions of each state are different. The articles of the regulations of each state reported a few days ago were adopted by the Land Administration Bureau from the book "Aliens and the Law" published by the North Carolina State University in the United States. The book was written by Gibson and is not the official document provided by the U.S. Embassy or Consulate. Therefore, the Land Administration Bureau is now requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to obtain this information.

### The Ministry of National Defense Dispatches Personnel to Supervise Military-Funded Education for Youths

It is reported that all schools have complied with the order after receiving it.

Another report: In order to enable youth military veterans from various places to have organized connections for management and mobilization, the Ministry of National Defense has specially set up youth military communication offices in various provinces and cities.

### Wu Weijing Discusses the Textile Industry in the Northeast After Returning from Inspection: There Are a Total of 550,000 Spindles; The Textile Construction Company Only Accepted One-Tenth

[Reported by this newspaper] Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the China Textile Construction Corporation, flew to Peiping in mid-October to inspect the textile industry in the northeastern provinces and investigate the cotton planting situation along the Longhai and Pinghan lines. He spent four weeks in total and returned to the city last Saturday. In an interview with reporters, he stated that he had inspected each of the four areas of Peiping, Tianjin, the Northeast, and the Longhai-Pinghan lines for about a week. The main purpose of the trip to the Northeast was to inspect the textile industry, raw material supply, cloth distribution, and the resumption of work of the factories taken over by the Textile Construction Company. The trip along the Longhai and Pinghan lines was to investigate the production and purchase volume of raw cotton.

Nineteen Cotton Mills Destroyed

When Wu spoke about the textile industry in the Northeast, he first mentioned the cotton spinning industry. Before the September 18th Incident, there was only one cotton mill operated by Chinese, the Fengtian Yarn Factory. Later, the Yingkou Yarn Factory was also established. However, both were successively purchased and merged by the Japanese. Up to now, there are eleven large and small cotton mills in the northeastern provinces, distributed in Shenyang (four), near Dalian (three), Liaoyang, Yingkou, Jinzhou, Andong, and other places (one each), with a total of 550,000 spindles. The four factories in Shenyang have a total of 160,000 spindles. The equipment in one factory has been completely removed by the Soviet army. The equipment in the other three factories was first removed by the Soviet army, then looted by local ruffians, and finally destroyed by fire. Only a few looms remain. These four factories are currently being reorganized by the Dongbei Production Administration. The three factories in Dalian have a total of 220,000 spindles. The damage is not serious, and it is actually the essence of the textile industry in the Northeast. However, they are still under the control of the Soviet army. The factories taken over by the Textile Construction Company are in Liaoyang, Yingkou, Jinzhou, and Andong. The factories in Liaoyang and Yingkou have been visited twice by both the Soviet army and the Communist Eighth Route Army, resulting in the removal of materials and important parts. The factory in Liaoyang has 78,000 spindles and 1,045 looms. Two spindles have now been put into operation. The factory in Yingkou has 55,000 spindles and 1,500 looms. 20,000 spindles have now been put into operation. The factory in Jinzhou has 51,000 spindles and 1,200 looms, and has complete printing and dyeing equipment. The machinery in this factory is the Toyota type from 1938, which is very new. 15,000 spindles have now been put into operation. The factory in Andong has 16,000 spindles. Since Andong has just been recovered, it is reported that the Communist army has not yet destroyed the factory. The Textile Construction Company has sent people to take over, but the details have not yet been reported. Therefore, in total, the eleven factories in the northeastern provinces have a total of 550,000 spindles, and the number of spindles that can be definitively determined to be in operation is probably the 55,000 spindles in the factories taken over by the Textile Construction Company.

Cotton Production Sufficient for Self-Sufficiency

Next, Wu spoke about the cotton planting situation in the Northeast. The Japanese developed agriculture with the spirit of developing industry, which is worth discussing. Before the September 18th Incident, cotton was not planted in the Northeast. However, after the Japanese forcibly occupied the Northeast, they actively planned to plant cotton. By the time Japan surrendered last year, they were able to produce 800,000 piculs annually, which was enough to supply 60% of the raw materials for the 550,000 spindles in the Northeast. The Japanese planned to increase production to 1.5 million piculs within three years, so that the Northeast could be self-sufficient in raw cotton. The Japanese promoted cotton planting through both economic and political means. A total of 18 large-scale cotton ginning factories were established in the cotton-producing areas of the Northeast. The Japanese calculated in advance the area of land to be planted and the amount of raw cotton that should be produced per mu (unit of area). All the seed cotton produced was handed over to the ginning factories for purchase. After the seed cotton was ginned, the good seeds were kept for planting the following year, and the inferior seeds were used for oil extraction. Therefore, there were only two types of cotton produced. One was the Guannong No. 1 American cotton variety, which accounted for 90% of the production. The other was the Liaoyang No. 1 cotton, which accounted for 10% of the production. The former had shorter cotton fibers and therefore matured earlier. The annual yield was also high, and the yield of seed cotton was also high, so it was widely planted and propagated. However, the Japanese were very harsh on those who failed to achieve the expected goals in cotton planting. They often took the old cotton from the clothes of cotton farmers to replace it. Finally, the Japanese invented man-made fibers made from wood pulp to replace raw cotton. The factory in Andong can now produce 100,000 tons of man-made fibers per day. However, the cost of this substitute is too high and it is not as durable as raw cotton.

Annual Production of 130,000 Tons of Hemp

The hemp weaving industry in the Northeast is second only to the cotton spinning industry in importance. There are currently five Soviet hemp weaving factories. They are distributed as follows: one factory in Liaoyang, which is now being taken over by the Production Administration. The loss to the factory was not great. Two factories in Shenyang, which are being taken over by the Ministry of Military Affairs. One factory in Changchun, the situation is unknown. The military hemp bags in the Northeast during the war were all supplied by these five factories. In terms of raw materials, there are green hemp and flax, etc. The Japanese forced the planting of hemp, so the annual hemp production in the Northeast reached 130,000 tons. There are four woolen mills in total. Most of the machines in the two factories in Shenyang have been removed by the Soviet army. One factory in Jinzhou, which is now being taken over by the Ministry of Military Affairs. The situation of the two factories in Harbin is unknown. The four factories have a total of 16,000-17,000 woolen spindles. There are a total of 3.7 million wool sheep in the Northeast, which can produce 70,000 tons of wool annually.

The tussah silk industry is the most developed in Andong, and can produce about 100,000 cocoons annually.

Clothing Problem is the Most Serious

According to Wu's observations, among the three major problems of food, clothing, and housing in the Northeast, the clothing problem is currently the most serious. In the past, because the Japanese controlled cotton cloth too strictly, almost all cotton cloth was supplied to the military. Therefore, the current price of cloth in the Northeast is 10-20% higher than in Guannei (areas south of the Great Wall). The Textile Construction Company is now accelerating the start-up rate of all the factories it has taken over in order to increase the production of yarn and cloth. At the same time, it is launching a campaign to transport yarn and cloth from the south to the north to alleviate the urgent need. In order to promote the cotton planting movement, those who sell cotton to the Textile Construction Company will be given preferential prices for yarn and cloth in exchange for the purchase of more cotton.

National Raw Cotton Production

Again, Wu spoke about the production, transportation, and purchase situation of raw cotton in the country. Wu said that according to preliminary estimates, the production of raw cotton in the country this year can reach 6.2 million piculs. Because the climate along the Longhai and Pinghan lines is good, production can increase to 7 million piculs. According to the investigation, the Northeast produced about 350,000 piculs this season. Xi'an produced 650,000 piculs. Henan produced 600,000 piculs. Hebei produced 1.8 million piculs.

In terms of cotton quality, Shaanxi is the best. More than half of the cotton produced in that area can be used to spin 42-count yarn. The cotton produced in Henan can be used to spin 32-count yarn. The cotton produced in the Northeast and Tianjin can be used to spin 20-count yarn. The cotton produced in Hebei is of the worst quality and can only be used to spin 12-count yarn. There is a situation of adulteration of cotton in various places. Wu sincerely hopes that the government authorities will find ways to inspect and crack down on it. Otherwise, the quality of raw cotton will inevitably decline day by day.

### Difficulties in Purchasing Cotton

Regarding the quantity of cotton purchased, Wu believes that it is not optimistic. The reasons are: (1) Transportation difficulties, traffic obstruction on the Longhai Railway. (2) Tight credit, difficulty in remittance. (3) Lack of packaging equipment. (4) The consumption of cotton by cotton farmers themselves is also considerable. Of the 7 million piculs of cotton, cotton farmers consume at least 4 million piculs themselves. The remaining one million piculs will be shelved due to inconvenient transportation. Only about 2 million piculs can be transported to various factories for use.

Wu concluded by saying that in order to solve the various problems of the textile industry in our country, the first thing is to stop the national military conflict as soon as possible. If peace is achieved, the cotton production in our country will definitely be self-sufficient within three years. This measure will not only be enough to revitalize the rural economy, but also to prosper our country's textile industry.

### Overview of the Hongying Library; Rich Collection of Historical Materials Since the Founding of the Republic of China; Depleted Funds Affect Expansion Plans

[Special Report by this Newspaper] At the intersection of Linsen Road and Fuxing West Road, there is a small two-story western-style house with a pointed roof and red walls. The iron gate of the surrounding wall is half-open and half-closed. If it were not for a long black copper sign hanging next to the door, probably no one would have thought that this place houses the "Hongying Library" with more than 150,000 volumes of books and magazines. For this library, I believe that most citizens may never have noticed its existence, the biggest reason probably being due to the relatively remote address. However, tracing back its history, it has been more than fifteen years. The current managing director, Huang Yanpei, who was also the original initiator, organized the Jiazi Society with Shen Xinqing, Yuan Guanlan, and others in 1924. The work was to select and compile descriptions of human culture, named "Humanities Series." In 1929, Qian Xinzhi and Xu Jingren raised funds to compile periodical indexes, humanities monthly magazines, and related series in addition to historical materials, and prepared for a library. In 1931, the "Jiazi Society" was officially renamed the "Humanities Society." It was not until 1932 that Mr. Ye Hongying donated 500,000 yuan. 100,000 yuan was allocated to run a village primary school, and the remaining 400,000 yuan was used as the library fund. The current address on Linsen Road was rented as the library building, which was the beginning of the establishment of the "Hongying Library."

Rich Collection of Historical Materials

Among the collection of more than 150,000 volumes, there are more than 50,000 books and more than 100,000 magazines. In addition, there are 49 kinds of newspapers. The nature of the books is more biased towards academics, especially Chinese and foreign history and geography, and local magazines are the most complete. Magazines and newspapers are collected completely, from the late Qing Dynasty to around 1924, they are mostly complete. But the most valuable thing is the rich collection of historical materials. From the founding of the Republic of China to 1940, all kinds of historical materials from various newspapers have been selected, clipped, edited, reviewed, and classified and bound, with a total of more than 3,000 volumes and more than 1.76 million pieces.

Relatively Few New Books

The relatively small number of new books and the lack of materials in recent years can explain the suffering of cultural undertakings since the War of Resistance. During the occupation, the enemy also visited, but fortunately they only confiscated more than 1,000 books that were said to contain anti-Japanese ideas, and the rest were preserved. However, due to rising prices, currency depreciation, and the gradual depletion of funds, coupled with the harsh environment, work inevitably stagnated. Although Huang raised nearly 20 million yuan from various parties after the victory, it was only enough to maintain the status quo under the soaring prices.

Number of Readers Per Day

Currently, the average number of people visiting the library every day is only about 40, mostly students from various universities looking for information. Each person is charged a reading fee of 100 yuan. The opening hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:30 PM to 5:00 PM. Although the address is a bit remote, the environment is very quiet.

The "Humanities Society" is constantly seeking to promote its cause. They have always hoped to build a larger library building, expand the equipment for books and magazines, and actively continue to engage in the publication of historical materials indexes, in order to make a greater contribution to society. However, all of this requires funding. They have already started a fundraising campaign with a preliminary goal of 200 million yuan, hoping that the wealthy people of Shanghai can enthusiastically support this cultural undertaking that has already reached a considerable scale.

[Reported by this newspaper] Shibahara Heisaburo, the former captain of the Hangzhou military police during the occupation period, is a Japanese war criminal who used his lewd power to rape hundreds of women in eastern Zhejiang. The military tribunal of the First Pacification Zone has filed a public prosecution against him, but it is still in the evidence-gathering stage. It is now known that Lin Chao, the manager of the New Asia Electric Appliance Factory in this city and a native of Cixi, has long been aware of Shibahara's criminal acts and is deeply angered by the devastation of his hometown. Driven by righteous indignation, he has written to the military tribunal offering to assist in the investigation and evidence collection. He plans to return to Ningbo specifically to contact elders in Shanghai and Ningbo, as well as organizations such as the Ningbo Anti-Japanese Comrades Suffering Association, to conduct separate investigations. He is also willing to fund local victims who report the crimes to come to Shanghai to testify in court, so that the crimes cannot be concealed.
市府接受舞弊案　陳吾嵩要求交保
Municipal Government Accepts Embezzlement Case; Chen Wusong Requests Bail

　　〔本報訊〕市府接收汽車舞弊嫌疑案中已扣押之重要嫌疑犯陳吾嵩，昨向地檢處遞狀，伸辯檢察官認爲對渠最不利之一點——一九三二年式Y10554　之小福特車，在接收汽車淸册上塡「好」。而仍送往萬泰車行修理。陳之狀內述稱；當時該車確係損壞，，未塡「好」。並稱；前在仰光·緬甸戰役中曾遭五次轟炸，受驚後身體裝弱，在押後健康情形更形不佳，故請求准予交保。
[Reported by this newspaper] Chen Wusong, a key suspect detained in the municipal government's automobile embezzlement case, submitted a petition to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday to defend himself against what the prosecutor considered the most unfavorable point against him: that a 1932 Y10554 small Ford car was marked "good" on the inventory of received automobiles, yet it was still sent to Wantai Motors for repairs. Chen stated in his petition that the car was indeed damaged at the time and was not marked "good." He also claimed that he had been bombed five times in the Battle of Rangoon, Burma, and that his health had deteriorated after being detained, so he requested bail.

郭錫麒攝影　新發明綢像　今日起同時展覽
Guo Xilin's Photography and Newly Invented Silk Images Exhibited Simultaneously Starting Today

　　〔本報訊〕中國綢像廠主辦郭錫麒設色攝影及該廠新發明綢像展覽，於今日起至十九日止，每日上午十時至下午五時，在大新公司二樓舉行。郭氏展覽名貴照片計二百餘幀，而綢照明尤爲攝影界一大貢獻。
[Reported by this newspaper] The Guo Xilin colored photography and the newly invented silk image exhibition organized by the China Silk Image Factory will be held from today to the 19th, from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. daily, on the second floor of the Great New Company. Mr. Guo is exhibiting more than 200 valuable photographs, and the silk lighting is a major contribution to the photography industry.

　　按綢像乃已故浙江醫專校長李滇　長公子李振民所發明。李氏聰敏多才於二十歲時，在浙大竺可楨校長鼓勵指導之下，即發明「度量衡計算尺」及「可變萬碼銷」兩種設計，並均呈准專利，李氏自幼即對攝影有極大興趣，數年前開始硏究綢像，乃父以月薪半數供其實騐仿製，起初成續不佳，後雖用荷蘭布試騐，但藥膜總難塗勻，後改用國產紡綢，以滾筒替代刷　，始於二十八年試騐成功，但李氏仍嫌不滿，再經多年硏究改良，始吿圓滿。
It is said that the silk image was invented by Li Zhenmin, the eldest son of the late Li Dian, the president of Zhejiang Medical College. At the age of twenty, under the encouragement and guidance of President Zhu Kezhen of Zhejiang University, Li invented the "Measurement Calculation Ruler" and the "Variable Ten Thousand Code Lock," both of which were patented. Li had a great interest in photography from an early age and began to study silk images several years ago. His father provided half of his monthly salary for him to experiment and imitate. At first, the results were not good. Later, although Dutch cloth was used for testing, it was always difficult to apply the chemical film evenly. Later, domestic spun silk was used instead, and a roller was used instead of a brush. The experiment was successful in the twenty-eighth year [of the Republic], but Li was still dissatisfied and continued to research and improve it for many years before it was completed.

　　製造綢像過程乃以最好之白紡綢，剔去斷絲和起毛部份，在暗房中塗上膠質滷素和銀化物等，亁燥後即可作晒紙應用。然後以一感光正當照片，附着於晒像紡綢之上，在日光下曝露約兩分鐘，綢面即現正影，再經顯影定影手續後即吿完成。最普通色彩爲淡黃，咖啡和藍色。現李氏經友好鼓勵，決定正式設立中國綢像廠製造，以資發揚國產。
The process of making silk images is to use the best white spun silk, remove the broken silk and fluff, and apply gelatinous halogen and silver compounds in a darkroom. After drying, it can be used as photographic paper. Then, a light-sensitive photograph is attached to the silk for exposure, and the silk surface shows a positive image after about two minutes of exposure to sunlight. After developing and fixing, it is completed. The most common colors are light yellow, coffee, and blue. Now, with the encouragement of friends, Li has decided to formally establish the China Silk Image Factory for manufacturing to promote domestic products.

[Reported by this newspaper] At about 9:30 p.m. the night before last, during a performance of the "Blood Droplet" opera at the Punan Zhongqu Theater in Lujiazui, Pudong, several gunshots suddenly rang out from below the stage, causing immediate chaos. Hundreds of male and female spectators were terrified and fled for their lives. Afterwards, the military police and the Yangjing Branch Bureau dispatched a large number of personnel to surround and search the area near the theater, but found nothing. It was later discovered that three male and female spectators were injured: (1) Zhu Fubao, female, 19 years old; (2) Zhu's sister, Tao, who lives at No. 10 Hannan, Lujiazui; (3) Tong Hai He Baolin (14 years old), a young owner of the Xieji Restaurant on Dongchang Road. They were later escorted to the nearby Bo'ai Hospital for treatment by the police.

Ten years ago, Fu married Fu Fengying in Hangzhou. Two years ago, it was rumored that he had an affair and met a woman surnamed Niu. Their affection grew deeper and deeper. After a long time, the affair was revealed. After friends intervened to mediate, Fu brought the woman surnamed Niu home. The night before last, the two women had a disagreement over trivial family matters. In his words, Fu favored his beloved concubine, causing Fengying to become very angry. At 6:00 a.m. yesterday, she secretly swallowed a one-carat solitaire diamond ring, attempting suicide. Fengying suffered excruciating abdominal pain. Later, the maid discovered her and rushed her to Renji Hospital for treatment. After the doctor gave her injections and enemas, the diamond ring was excreted from her abdomen, and she was fortunate to recover.
冒充上海啤酒　印刷所主告發
Imitating Shanghai Beer; Printing House Owner Reports

　　〔本報訊〕本市天平路三十號鴻茂蔬菜舖，兼售啤酒，因品質不佳，銷數甚少，店主閻振德遂思將該項啤酒冒充「UB」商標之上海啤酒，委託江蘇路二八〇號合衆印刷所張志儉仿印「UB」商標紙一萬張，付定洋十萬元，張受託後又向牛莊路七二七號藝　製版公司製造　版四塊，及新閘路二二九號　星印刷所刻製滿圓形木版二塊，各版備妥後，張又轉託聯文美術印刷所鉛印部職負孫瑞鶴代印，事機不密，被所主虞榮發覺，經其報吿上海啤酒廠，由廠方轉報江寗路警分局，將該案破獲，並抄得已製就之僞商標五千張，於一昨日下午由江寗分局將此案解送一地檢處法辦。
[Reported by this newspaper] Hongmao Vegetable Shop, No. 30 Tianping Road, in this city, also sells beer. Due to poor quality, sales were very low. The shop owner, Yan Zhende, thought of imitating Shanghai Beer with the "UB" trademark for the beer. He commissioned Zhang Zhijian of Hezhong Printing House, No. 280 Jiangsu Road, to imitate and print 10,000 sheets of "UB" trademark paper, paying a deposit of 100,000 yuan. After accepting the commission, Zhang also asked Yi [unclear character] Plate Making Company, No. 727 Niuzhuang Road, to make four plates, and Xing Printing House, No. 229 Xinzha Road, to carve two full circular wooden plates. After the plates were prepared, Zhang then entrusted Sun Ruihe, who was responsible for the letterpress department of Lianwen Art Printing House, to print them on his behalf. The matter was not kept secret and was discovered by the owner of the printing house, Yu Rong. After he reported it to the Shanghai Beer Factory, the factory reported it to the Jiangning Road Police Sub-bureau, which cracked the case and seized 5,000 forged trademarks that had been made. Yesterday afternoon, the Jiangning Sub-bureau transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling.

　　（一）手生贅肉
(1) Excess Flesh on Hands

　　黃維明問我是一個男性靑年，身體素健，但近來雙手有小肉生出，不痛不腫，俗稱曰「豬頭肉」我曾用碱與石灰剪破後敷之，尙有效騐，然愈後不久，即又生長於他處，且剪後疤痕不退，誠屬隱憂，不知應如何治療？
Huang Weiming asks: I am a young man in good health, but recently, small pieces of flesh have grown on my hands, without pain or swelling, commonly known as "pig's head meat." I have tried cutting them off with alkali and lime and applying it to them, which has been effective, but soon after healing, they grow again elsewhere, and the scars after cutting do not fade, which is a real concern. I don't know how to treat it.

　　〔張仲明醫師答〕手上之肉疣，宜用手術或電燙根除，若用硝酸銀等腐蝕劑，亦可見效
[Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies] For warts on the hands, surgery or electrocautery should be used to remove them. Corrosives such as silver nitrate can also be effective.

　　（二）麻瘋惡症
(2) Leprosy

　　陸慶祥問　我有一個朋友，不幸患了麻瘋病，現在手指已爛去一節，雖然他有强他的身體，但前途是非常可怕的，曾來滬在「中國痳瘋病院」醫過一次，但他家裏很窮。未能將其治愈，現在我有幾個問題請求解答：（一）中國痳瘋病院在何處？現仍有貧民免費診療否？（二）此病能否治瘉？
Lu Qingxiang asks: I have a friend who unfortunately has leprosy. Now, one section of his finger has rotted away. Although he is trying to strengthen his body, the future is very scary. He came to Shanghai to be treated at the "China Leprosy Hospital" once, but his family is very poor and unable to cure him. Now, I have several questions to ask: (1) Where is the China Leprosy Hospital located? Does it still offer free treatment for the poor? (2) Can this disease be cured?

　　〔張仲明醫師答〕白利南路有一麻瘋醫院，貧民可以免費診療，此症一經發出，就不易治愈，且極易傳染，故患者經醫師證實後，須與常人完全隔離。
[Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies] There is a leprosy hospital on Bailinan Road where the poor can receive free treatment. Once this disease occurs, it is difficult to cure and is very contagious. Therefore, after the patient is diagnosed by a doctor, they must be completely isolated from ordinary people.

Anecdotes of the Youth of the Founding Father of the Nation, Mr. Sun Yat-sen   Lu Danlin

The life of the Founding Father was dedicated to revolution for over forty years, all for the sake of China's freedom and equality, and for the completion of the construction of a nation based on the Three Principles of the People. Such lofty and great character and the spirit of courageous advancement should not be limited to commemorative days but should be constantly remembered and practiced diligently.

An extraordinary person also has anecdotes that distinguish him from ordinary people in his childhood. Now, taking advantage of the anniversary of his birth, I will discuss anecdotes from the childhood of the Founding Father.

From his early years, the Founding Father possessed revolutionary ideas, as if revolution was innate. He never proactively bullied others, but if someone unreasonably insulted him, he would immediately resist. He also had a sense of justice and was not afraid of fighting. One day, the Founding Father was walking in a garden on his way home from school when he suddenly saw dozens of Qing soldiers and yamen runners, armed with weapons, surrounding the house of the garden owner. They dragged out the garden owner and his two brothers, put them in shackles, and escorted them away. One of them was subjected to torture, while the others were imprisoned, and their property was confiscated. The villagers, fearing the tyrannical officials, dared to be angry but not speak out. The Founding Father was extremely indignant and mustered the courage to ask the village chief. The village chief became angry, threatened him with a knife, and forbade him from speaking out. The Founding Father realized that civil rights were not promoted and corrupt officials were rampant, and his resistance to despotic power had already been brewing since his childhood.

On another occasion, the residence of a wealthy merchant in the village was suddenly robbed by pirates. The villagers fled in panic. Upon hearing this, the Founding Father calmly went to the robbed household to investigate. It happened to be when the bandits were searching for belongings. He looked at the fierce faces of the robbers, expressing his disdain. On the one hand, he secretly cursed the local officials for failing to protect public safety and that the locality did not organize itself for self-defense, resulting in rampant bandits, as if the area was deserted.

Seeing the pain of his elder sister's bound feet, the Founding Father advised his mother not to follow the custom and inflict such suffering on her. Unable to overcome the backward customs of society, which could not be changed within the family for a time, the Founding Father was stimulated by this and became even more determined to work hard to transform society.

Da Cheng Gong was a farmer who lived a simple and frugal life. When the Founding Father studied at night, he only lit a lamp if there was no moonlight; if there was moonlight, he would read under the moonlight. When he did use a lamp, he only used one wick, otherwise, his mother would scold him for being wasteful. In such an environment, he diligently recited and reviewed his lessons. He entered a private school at the age of seven. The teacher taught him the "Three Character Classic." Although he could recite it fluently, he did not understand the meaning of the book. When he asked the teacher, the teacher could not explain it clearly, preventing this intelligent young student from gaining understanding.

He would ask his mother how the blue sky was created, what was the meaning of calling the emperor "Long Live," and what happened when people died. His mother could not answer these questions. Later, he realized that death meant the end of everything, so he said, "After I die in the future, I will not let my life end like this." Indeed, his prediction came true more than fifty years later.

Decades ago, people were deeply superstitious about idols. The hand of the idol in the North Emperor Temple in Cuiheng Village was destroyed by the Founding Father and Lu Haodong, which aroused the anger of the villagers. However, the Founding Father knew that those lifeless idols made of wood and stone could not bring blessings or dispel disasters. By destroying them, he expressed his resistance to superstition, letting the villagers know that man-made objects of clay and wood were merely puppets and had nothing to do with people's fortunes.

The various anecdotes from the Founding Father's childhood all reveal his resistance to tyranny, his struggle for human rights, his pursuit of freedom, his breaking of superstitions, and his search for truth. "Seeing the small, one knows the great," and "from the small, one can see the large." The revolutionary endeavors of the following forty years, the expulsion of the Manchus, the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, the constitutional protection movement, and the wars, all began to take shape in his youth.

Sand Grain   Jiang Dun

Silence! Like a silent, solid grain of sand.

A tiny grain of sand, without the brilliance of a gem or the preciousness of gold, seems to have been forgotten by us. However, countless tiny grains of sand silently gather to form beaches, hills, and pave our roads...

We carelessly walk over it, but it kisses our burning feet. Some people who walk with firm steps may have their feet pierced by the sand, leaving a trace of blood, telling them this is the road they have walked!

Sand grains tell us that only stronger and more solid life can be everywhere and can last forever!

Remnants   Gang Wu

It's a pity to throw away what's left after eating.

Xiao Sizi ate a sesame seed cake, and the sesame seeds fell into the cracks of the table. He slapped them down. It doesn't matter if his palm hurts, the materials weren't wasted.

Locals set up banquets, and the pork knuckles and whole ducks are frozen and untouched. Afterwards, they are brought back intact. Even chicken heads and fish tails can be distributed to the students and children to "fill their heads."

But there are many leftover materials, but too little leftover salary!

However, in some corners, there are still many leftover commoners who have never seen leftover materials in their lives. After two months, one could say, "There are those who have not seen it for thirty-six years." We can reuse our leftover energy to engage in several more leftover internal conflicts. Anyway, we are a first-class power, and Heaven will bless us with "post-war" relief!

Public utilities will surely develop greatly. The worry of "no car to go out" is already a leftover concern. Leftover rickshaws will naturally be eliminated. The leftover roads are for jeeps and tigers to gallop on. Citizens cannot squeeze onto public transport, so they can use their leftover leg strength to spend their leftover time.

The appointment of traitors should be limited, so that many leftover traitors can be preserved. A great nation can accommodate them. Wouldn't it be a pity if they became extinct? People are inherently hypocritical, so why take it seriously?

Various countries are researching the atom, and Japan is also requesting to keep it. Okay! Let's make it public and drop a few bombs on them, giving the remaining people groaning in suffering a safe "resting place"!

San'er   Lu Yang

—Memories of First Love

San'er was the childhood name of a female classmate of mine from junior high school. I don't know how everyone found out. For a slightly more attractive member of the opposite sex, boys are sometimes as greedy as hounds. Sometimes, in the dormitories after evening self-study, some older classmates would say some incomprehensible and lewd things. At that time, I was young, just a teenager. But unconsciously, San'er seemed to have crawled into my life, and San'er even seemed to belong to something of mine, but I couldn't explain what it was.

The first time I saw San'er was in the auditorium during a weekly assembly. She was sitting in the back row on the right. A friend from the same dormitory pointed her out to me. When I turned my head to search for her with my eyes, my face inexplicably flushed. But I finally recognized her. The pair of yellow velvet flowers on her black braids confused me first. Her face was not as white and tender as I imagined, but slightly dark. Her big eyes were hazy, like a strange sea shrouded in light mist. Most of her body was leaning against the backrest, and her chest rose and fell like waves, revealing a slender, curved beauty. I couldn't help but whisper: A lithe girl like a snake!

That night, I dreamed that the hair ornaments turned into a pair of yellow butterflies, fluttering in front of my eyes.

Not long after, she happened to join the same wall newspaper group as me. My writing ability and demeanor seemed to gradually attract her attention. A boy's strengths also make girls care, right? I thought, and gained more courage.

I felt that I was in love with her, although I didn't know what love was. I only knew that my spirit could not leave her for a moment. If she wasn't in my life, then everything would become meaningless. And she should only be loved by me, she cannot love others, and others cannot love her.

Hot blood burned in my heart. Every accidental meeting made my heart beat faster and my face flushed. I should pour out this infinite tide of emotions to her! Talk? No way.

Finally, one day, I made an excuse to ask her to read a manuscript, secretly slipping a long letter inside. When I came back, I fell headfirst on the bed, not eating or drinking, as if I had malaria, excited and nervous for a while, and thinking that I was "cooled down" for another.

The next day, when I walked into the classroom with a pale face after a sleepless night, I was surprised not to see her. After calming down, I found her sick leave slip posted on the wall.

For three days, four days, I didn't receive a single word of reply. I really got sick, sick for no reason. I just had a high fever and mouth sores. I was sent to the hospital.

The morning light of Easter, warm and bright, shone on a corner of the hospital bed. A collective chorus of white-clothed angels came from outside the window. It was bright and musical. What a good day!

My health gradually recovered. My mood after despair turned calm. Bathed in the golden sunlight, I happily and lazily dreamed golden dreams. I remembered my hometown, my mother, and the enemy's cruel rule. I also looked forward to my own future, which should be a magnificent and great scene.

"Lu Yang!" I couldn't believe I suddenly heard such a clear and delicate voice in my ears. I opened my eyes as if in a dream. Heavens! Standing at the head of the bed was a face of warmth, shyness, guilt, and a smile, holding two strangely shining crystal gems; it was a pair of fluttering yellow butterflies; it was...

"Ah, it's you?" I seemed to fall from one world into another, unconsciously filling with tears.

I was discharged from the hospital that afternoon.

After that, at school, because of the constraints of the environment, we couldn't have a pleasant and unrestrained conversation. We only shot affectionate and caring glances at each other when we met, occasionally sending a few letters to express our feelings. But no matter what, my heart was full and overflowing with joy, and my feet tapped out the rhythm of a youthful love song.

And don't forget: This was during the war, and it was an occupied area. This summer, our school was closed by the enemy.

What a short period of milky white time!

The night before the parting, I secretly asked her to talk in the auditorium. She arrived on time, but she brought a bodyguard, also a female classmate in the class. I felt quite embarrassed, and I didn't know how to say it. Apart from exchanging plans for the future, there wasn't a deep sentence. The only thing that jumped in my memory was her shy bow, when I glanced at her sideways in the moonlight.

When I returned, I hated and blamed myself for being useless, but I couldn't help but wonder: Why don't girls want their boyfriends to reveal secrets in love, but they often set up think tanks themselves?

Late at night, I wrote a five-page lingering and determined farewell letter.

Goodbye, my love. When I hired a rickshaw to go out of the street, I found her pair of starry, shining eyes, piercing through the morning mist, calling to me "Goodbye." From then on, what accompanied me were poverty, exile, and endless battles. Love will write an immortal epic. From then on, the gap between the free zone and the occupied zone cut off each other's news.

Not long after the victory, I sent her a letter woven with old feelings. Almost a year passed, but there was no reply. In the summer, I happened to meet an old classmate from my hometown, who happened to be the one who first pointed me out to recognize "San'er." He said that he had heard San'er say that she was no longer interested in those things from her youth.

For many days, I pondered this matter. This wasn't love, this was a comedy of youth; no! This was the overflow of emotion when childishness hadn't yet faded.

Let the past bury the old dreams, I should pursue the spring light before me.

Ripe Year   Cai Lin

Rice fears ripening. This autumn, the rice ripened so severely that I watched it almost dry to death. The fields also cracked. The farmers pumped water day and night, finally turning the danger into safety. This year, we have 1.2 harvests per mu. It's a ripe year for rice.

When the cotton was only as long as chopsticks, the heavens didn't help. A strong wind and heavy rain drowned the cotton. The villagers cried and wailed, thinking that this year would be hard to get through. Unexpectedly, the cotton that was submerged in water gradually recovered after the flood receded, and it was a complete harvest. I didn't expect cotton to have a ripe year too.

The hairy crabs in Yangcheng Lake have an especially high yield this year. The "gutless gentlemen" on the crab stalls are busier than the bedbugs in Shanghai's back alleys. Moreover, each one is big and fat. As a result, Shanghai is flooded with lake crabs. For at most 10,000 yuan, you can buy six. This year is also a ripe year for hairy crabs.

Everywhere you turn, you see unemployed people with worried looks. Perhaps unemployed friends also have a ripe year.

Cases of corruption are often heard, and cases of fraud are even more frequent. Can this be considered a ripe year?

Poetry and Reality   Luo Binjia

If a poet can grasp the present every day, and only deal with what is presented before their eyes with a fresh mind, then they will definitely be able to create good or even excellent works, no matter when or where. Even if they occasionally fail, there will be no loss. (Quoted from "Conversations with Goethe")

Coolie   Luo Gannian

Every Inch of Mountain, Every Inch of River, Every Drop of Blood   96   Ye Jingfeng

"Little aunt, I've counted them. Going down the line to the north, there are twenty-nine of these things." "These things" of course refers to the gun emplacements.

"Why do the gun mounts need Sichuan coal blocks for installation?" I asked myself. I thought the devil's plan was probably a two-pronged approach: On one hand, coal blocks could be used to hide the gun emplacements, and on the other hand, coal could be stored as much as possible. Perhaps only the surface layer is coal, and below are concrete gun emplacements and underground ammunition depots! From this, we can also see that the Japanese are meticulous in their crude planning, and the meticulousness contains infinite stupidity. However, setting up such an arrangement in this remote and desolate place is indeed a bit scary. It also shows that the Japanese are extremely unscrupulous in their ambition to harm us.

On top of the coal pile, we could also see the light of the automatic searchlight drawing circles. However, the angle was not high, and the light was not strong, so it couldn't reach here at all.

According to my calculations, time was very tight, and there was no time to carefully study the construction and layout of these gun emplacements. I told Tiger Brother to quickly return to the east side of the coal pile to deal with the gasoline. Just as Tiger Brother was about to move, I grabbed him again and pointed to the westernmost edge, asking what the situation was like and whether he could see it. Tiger Brother said that he had seen it from the top of the coal pile, and the layout was the same as the east side. Outside the stream, there seemed to be a road, but what kind of ground was between the stream and the road was not very clear.

Destroying this large amount of gasoline was not an easy task. The method I had in mind was to open dozens of oil drums in the bottom row of this mountain of gasoline, simply prying open a small hole in each drum with some iron tool, and then drawing as much oil as possible from the oil pool with a spout, spreading it all over this ten-zhang square area, preferably letting the oil flow towards the drum piles. In this way, with just a match, this work area could immediately become a sea of fire, and the openings of the bottom row of gasoline drums could immediately catch fire. As long as these oil drums caught fire, the firepower would be so great that they would surely burn all the oil drums red and cause them to explode.

I told Tiger Brother about this method. Tiger Brother was extremely happy, but he scratched his head, as if there were other difficulties. We walked along the edge of the coal pile, preparing to go around from the south end of the coal pile, and also wanted to see what those tall warehouses were, whether they were really warehouses. This would only take ten or eight minutes at most, and I just hoped for unexpected new discoveries. This area was uniformly built (four warehouses?) and faced the four four-story buildings on the east side from afar, which was quite neat and spectacular.

When we got to the base of the warehouse wall, we saw that the north wall had not a single window opening. We went around from the east to the south, thinking there would be a large door, but who knew that these two high walls only had three rows of small circular windows from bottom to top, each row about eight or nine feet apart, and the area was very small, just a kind of ventilation device. This confirmed that this must be a warehouse. When we got to the western corner, there was a device like a large door at this corner, with two white characters "出口" (Exit) on it, each more than a foot square. I approached it and touched it with my hand, knowing that it was made of steel plate, but it was a whole large piece, without any handles or anything like that, and the whole piece was embedded in the wall, more than a foot deep. I knew that this thing must be controlled by electricity; to open it, you had to start the electric switch and let it slowly rise. From this, I knew that this warehouse must be an arsenal.

We hurriedly ran along the wall to the north end, where there was a door at the corner like the one on the south end, with the two large characters "人口" (Entrance). Just as we were about to rush back to the gasoline drum area to start working, we suddenly heard "Dong, dong" twice, as if it was above our heads. This sound seemed to be coming from a loudspeaker. Tiger Brother and I were startled when we heard this sound. There was nowhere to hide here, so we had to shrink our bodies as much as possible and crouch in the corner of the wall.

Billion National Assembly Hall   Shao Fu

Today, more than a thousand representatives from across the country will gather in the magnificent National Assembly Hall on Guofu Road in Nanjing to discuss state affairs. This grand building was completed before the War of Resistance and has taken almost ten years to truly fulfill its mission. It can be said that its fate has been full of twists and turns.

I have a special affection for this building, not because it hosted a performance of "La Traviata" nine years after it was completed, which I enjoyed, but because in early September last year, after the victory, I flew from Chongqing to Nanjing for the first time and returned to Nanjing after eight years. The first place I stayed was the National Assembly Hall. Although it was quite dilapidated at that time, almost empty, I dare say that everyone in our returning capital group felt very close to this building.

The National Assembly Hall in Nanjing reminds me of the one below Fuxing Pass in Chongqing. After that building was completed, it only hosted one session of the Political Consultative Conference and was subsequently destroyed by enemy bombing. In the rear during the war, with such difficult material conditions, the central government still spent huge sums to build such a grand assembly hall, which shows the government's determination to hold the National Assembly.

In terms of the surrounding environment, atmosphere, and scenery, the assembly hall in Chongqing was far superior to the one on Guofu Road in Nanjing. Unfortunately, that site has now been redeveloped into a National Sports Field.

Zhou Fohai: No Mercy!   Hong Guo

Please Government Must Uphold Original Sentence

The "mystery" of the traitor Zhou Fohai has finally been revealed before justice and national law! We, as the people, hope that everything in the country is on the right track. Hearing this news that the authorities are enforcing the law like a mountain, we can't help but applaud and support it. Unexpectedly, there are even people with connections who say, "We thought that Zhou Fohai, although nominally participating in the puppet government for eight years, was actually beneficial to the people; for example, issuing counterfeit money could indeed resist enemy military tickets, so that the people who had lost government protection could still live in peace. Zhou has now been punished for the crime of traitor and has been sentenced to death, we all feel that the sentence is too heavy"!

The traitor Zhou colluded with the enemy and committed evil deeds first, and then made contributions by contacting our comrades in the War of Resistance later. On one hand, he made a fortune through the Central Reserve Bank notes, and on the other hand, he left himself a way out. If this kind of traitor is not put to death, who will be willing to participate in the War of Resistance if there is a second Sino-Japanese War in the future? We feel that the above-mentioned argument of harboring a traitor with ulterior motives is worthy of attention; therefore, after Zhou has already been sentenced to death in the first instance, we must continue to cry out: Please the government must uphold the original sentence. Everything else can be lost, but the hearts of the people cannot be lost! The people of the country all say that Zhou Fohai should be killed, without mercy!

Seek it from Within   Wu Jun

Six Japanese ships with Band-Aid flags have appeared on the Huangpu River, causing a lot of commotion and making people as nervous as a bow reflected in a cup, greatly alarming, but in reality, there is no need for this. The problem is very simple. If we live up to expectations, we don't need to be afraid; if we don't live up to expectations, we will not only be afraid for the rest of our lives, but also be bullied by others at any time. It's not just a small island country like Japan that will look down on us.

Conversely, the Sino-US Treaty of Commerce has already been signed, and it is indeed equal and reciprocal in itself, but let me ask: They have ships coming over, but do we have ships going over? They have goods coming in an endless stream, but do we have goods going out in large quantities? Therefore, they are actually taking great advantage. We can't blame them for this. Who told us not to live up to expectations?

Therefore, regardless of whether they are enemies or friends, if we don't live up to expectations, the enemy will certainly swallow us, and even if friends don't intend to take advantage, they will still take advantage. Let those Band-Aid ships go, ignore them, and pull ourselves together. That's the right thing to do!

Too Outrageous   Gui Dequ

A ×-style leather coat, a ×-style uniform, leather shoes...; paired with a ××-style pistol; an officer dressed like this was pacing on the sidewalk under the lights of Mingyao Road, casually looking at the shop windows along the street.

A merchant-like person, carrying a briefcase, walked over and carelessly bumped into the officer.

The merchant looked, saw that it was nothing, and continued to walk forward; the officer turned around and chased after him;

"Slap, slap!" Two slaps to the left and right of the other person's face, "Damn it, don't you have any manners?"

"You... hit..."

"Damn it, what if I hit you? You have no manners, go to hell!" Saying that, he gave two more slaps: "Slap, slap."

The merchant hurriedly apologized, bowed, kowtowed, and said sorry.

The result was probably still so-called "going to the team."

The crowd of onlookers shook their heads and sighed. One of the more clever ones said:

"Go home and sleep!"

So the clever people mostly went home to "sleep"—peace, long live!

Marriage Advertisement   Hu Mu

Originally, I wasn't superstitious, but when I was bored, I passed a fortune teller who said I would have a letter this year. I consulted my friends and placed a marriage advertisement in a newspaper, which read: "I was unfortunately born in China, and even more unfortunately grew up in a troubled world. I originally studied politics, but now I am in the military. In times of utter spiritual desolation and poverty, I wish to find a girlfriend to be my wife. The respondents should be the daughters of those who made a fortune from national disasters, or the daughters of those who unscrupulously seized land and robbed people. I don't care about their academic qualifications, only how many gold bars they have, how many houses they own. I don't care about their looks, only whether they don't have pockmarks or limp. Applicants should submit an autobiography, two photos, and a certificate from the Central Hospital proving they have no incurable diseases, and send them to Mr. ×× at ×× Bridge, ×× Road, ×××, this city, for forwarding!"

This advertisement was published in Nanjing newspapers, but no one responded. I am specially copying the original text to "Free Talk" as an article for publication. Readers, please give your advice!

Fire in a Carriage   Xia Yefeng

According to someone from Nanjing, on the 4th of this month, the 5th special express train leaving Nanjing caught fire in a third-class carriage near Benniu. The order was immediately disrupted. The driver heard the sound and braked after about half an hour, but two people had already jumped out of the train and died.

It is said that the cause of the fire was due to a passenger carelessly throwing a cigarette butt into the window panel.

The Chinese have never paid much attention to public morality, especially smoking at will in public places. They only care about having a cigarette in hand and enjoying themselves, regardless of whether others are suffering from headaches and dizziness, or even causing the tragedy of a fire in the carriage this time.

Speaking of smoking, I am reminded of the etiquette of smoking. In other countries, when smoking in public places, if there are women present, you must first obtain their consent and politely ask: "Madam! May I smoke a cigarette?"

Foreigners love freedom, but they also respect the freedom of others at the same time. In this regard, we should learn. This is good etiquette, which is worth considering for our "noble" compatriots who only love their own freedom and disregard the freedom of others.

Smoking in public places (except at banquets) is already very reluctant, let alone smoking leisurely on a crowded train. Isn't it too disregarding the freedom of others?

Therefore, it is necessary to prohibit smoking in the carriage, and it should be strictly enforced.

A train fire, becoming a "fire" train, is probably the first time this has happened on the Beijing-Shanghai line after the victory! After this "lesson," the railway authorities should also pay attention and not neglect smoking passengers, or neglect cigarette butts that can start a prairie fire, for the safety of all passengers!

Cotton and Livestock   Hu Yan

It is said that the number one import of our country is cotton, and the number one export is livestock.

Our country has always been known as an agricultural country, and cotton is a truly local product, but the import of cotton ranks first! From this, it can be seen that although it has been more than a year since the victory, the rural areas have not recovered, and the strong laborers have not returned to farming. Although the land is vast and the resources are abundant, there is still nothing that can be done.

For a product like cotton, as long as there are seeds, land, and manpower, even in our country, where machinery is very lacking, we can find ways to increase production. Setting up supervisory offices in various provinces, providing seeds, providing agricultural loans, and rewarding cotton planting, with everyone working together, we can achieve the goal of increasing production in just one year. Instead of thinking about it from the root, only knowing how to desperately import foreign cotton, isn't it ridiculous? Isn't it scary?

It is really puzzling what exactly the number one export of livestock is. Is it pandas? There probably aren't that many. If I had to guess, it would probably be things like chickens, ducks, and pigs, but our country has never had a large output of these animals. Now, desperately exporting these livestock will eventually lead to a lack of succession. Moreover, it is also somewhat ridiculous and scary for a country to lack livestock as a major export product.

In terms of our country's current economic situation, the number one import should be machinery. On one hand, we should hire foreign engineers and train our technicians, and desperately produce to slightly alleviate the people's difficulties. The number one export should be minerals, silk, tung oil, and eggs; these items have fewer uses in the country and should be collectively purchased and sold overseas by officials and merchants to strive for a balance of imports and exports.

Looking at our import and export goods, I can't help but express the above complaints. Of course, complaints are valuable at the moment!

The Old Revolutionary, Tan Zhen   Dun Fu

The Recently Retired Vice President of the Judicial Yuan

Forty-five years ago, the Changde Middle School in Hunan Province held an opening ceremony for the completion of its library. When the principal finished reading his grand and eloquent speech and was about to dismiss the meeting, a student with a rustic appearance suddenly strode onto the stage, bowed to the teachers and students present, and then gave a grand "speech," scolding the corruption of the Qing court at the time, the Empress Dowager's licentiousness, and praising Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao without reservation. Such "heresy"—at that time, the Empress Dowager was in power. It should have been punishable by death without a doubt. Fortunately, Zhu Shuyi, the prefect of Changde (i.e., the father of Zhu Jingnong), tried his best to protect him and "expelled him from school and deported him." This student who was regarded as "rebellious" was none other than the current Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, Tan Zhen.

After Tan was expelled from school, he studied at Waseda University in Japan. At that time, Japan, at the request of the Qing court, promulgated "Regulations for Overseas Students" to crack down on revolutionary elements among the overseas students. Chen Tianhua, an overseas student from Hunan, committed suicide in the sea out of indignation because of this. All the overseas students packed up and returned to China. Tan founded the Western Road Public School in Hunan and served as its principal. Just as the Qing court was vigorously suppressing the revolution, our Mr. Tan became "restless" again and openly buried Chen Tianhua on Yuelu Mountain. The Qing officials were furious and ordered his arrest. Tan then slipped back to Japan. A year later, thinking that nothing would happen, he slipped back again, but this time, it was terrible and he became a fish that voluntarily jumped into the net.

This time, Tan's life was originally "over," but he did not die. The reason was that the prefect of Hunan Province had some "love for talent." With the help of the prefect's mediation, Tan only received the punishment of being "escorted back to his hometown and imprisoned for life."

When Puyi ascended the throne, it was customary to grant a general amnesty, but our Mr. Tan was in the "ten unpardonable crimes" category and did not receive any "Great Qing grace." However, before long, the Wuchang Uprising broke out, and the whole country responded. Tan was released from prison, changing from a prisoner to a member of the provisional Senate.

When the Kuomintang was reorganized in 1924, he served as a member of the first Central Executive Committee. In 1932, he was elected Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, and later transferred to the Vice President of the Judicial Yuan until now.

Tan's courtesy name is Liming, and he is from Taoyuan, Hunan. His personality has always been informal, and his life is completely ordinary. Before becoming the Vice President, he was often associated with pawnshops. Although he now holds an important position, his situation is still not very good. He is not particular about food and drink, but he likes to eat dog meat and turtle meat. In the past, he was a vanguard of the revolution, but now he has long since "concealed his edge and hidden his sharpness," and no longer has the "drawn sword and cocked bow" temper of his early years. He is cheerful and does not know that old age is coming. Wait a minute! Not long ago, didn't the newspaper say that Vice President Tan resigned due to old age? It is really unbelievable that such an optimistic and open-minded person would suddenly think of "old age." Moreover, Tan is only sixty-three years old this year, which cannot be considered very old. The Central Government has also sent a letter to persuade him to stay. I hope Tan will release the spirit of his early years and be a civil servant for another twenty years!

Special Issue Commemorating the Founding Father's Birthday

The Founding Father's Constitutional Ideal

  This Newspaper's Data Room

For forty years, the Founding Father led the national revolution with the implementation of constitutional government as the ultimate goal of his politics. He explored the advantages and disadvantages of constitutional government in various countries and believed that the root of the problem with the rights-based constitutions of European and American countries was that the power of examination was subordinate to the executive power, and the power of impeachment was subordinate to the legislative power. Therefore, during implementation, various malpractices were inevitable. In ancient China, the application of the three-power constitution already existed, but the legislative, judicial, and executive powers were subordinate to the power of the monarch, and although the power of examination and the power of impeachment were nominally independent, they were still easily controlled by the power of the monarch. The Founding Father, understanding China's political traditions and actual needs, created the five-power constitution. He said in "The Three Principles of the People": "Establishing the five-power constitution is to remedy the past incompleteness. We now want to combine China's examination power and supervision power with the central power and judicial power, to form a very good and complete system, creating a government with five powers separated. Such a government is the most complete and best government in the world. With such a good government, the country can achieve a country of the people, by the people, and for the people." This is the Founding Father's ideal of the five-power constitution.

From the perspective of ideology, the Principle of Democracy in the Three Principles of the People is precisely the embodiment of the five-power constitution. And its perfect application depends on the division of powers and functions and the system of balanced powers. The Founding Father said: "With regard to the country's politics, the fundamental thing is that the people have power; as for those who manage the government, they should be entrusted to competent specialists. The people should have four political rights: election, recall, initiative, and referendum. These political rights are the rights of the people. Government power is five kinds of governing rights: legislative, executive, examination, supervision, and judicial. Division of labor, checks and balances, mutual assistance, and cooperation can enable the government to achieve omnipotence."

Implementing constitutional government and returning sovereignty to the people has always been the Founding Father's consistent ideal. In the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China, which was formulated in Nanjing, there is a clause stating that "The sovereignty of the Republic of China belongs to the entire body of citizens," which was originally proposed by the Founding Father. In the sixth chapter of "Sun Wen's Doctrine," the process by which the state enters constitutional government is also described in detail: "The period of revolutionary progress is divided into three stages: First, the military government period, which is the period of destruction. Second, the transitional period: with a county as an autonomous unit...limited to three years...After the country is pacified for six years, each county that has achieved complete autonomy shall elect one representative to organize the National Assembly to formulate the five-power constitution...After the constitution is formulated, and the president and members are elected, the revolutionary government shall

The National Assembly and the Constitution

Our Newspaper Archives

In July of the 26th year of the Republic of China, the re-elections in various provinces and cities were being intensified, and it was expected that they would all be completed within one or two months to prepare for the convocation of the National Assembly. At this moment, the July 7th Incident occurred, and a full-scale and long-term war of resistance began. The government devoted all its efforts to resisting the strong enemy, and most of the elected representatives from all parties were assigned to the front lines and rear areas to perform tasks directly related to the war of resistance, and were unable to spare the time to attend a meeting for calm discussion. Therefore, the National Government had no choice but to issue an order on October 4th of the 26th year of the Republic of China to postpone the National Assembly. The implementation of constitutional government was thus suddenly frustrated by the Japanese invasion.

The Foundation of National Construction

Although the convocation of the National Assembly was postponed, the government's preparations for the National Assembly did not slacken even for a day during the eight years of arduous war of resistance. For those provinces and cities where representatives had not been fully elected due to the outbreak of the war of resistance, elections were actively continued. Representatives from provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Xikang, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Suiyuan, Xinjiang, and cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Qingdao, and Xijing were elected one after another, and the elections of professional representatives in various provinces were also gradually completed. At the same time, although the government was unwilling to hastily convene a National Assembly during the war of resistance, in order to gather ideas and benefit from all sources, and to enable talents from all over the country to devote their efforts to seeking victory in the war of resistance and success in national construction, it established a National Political Council with the spirit of the National Assembly in the 27th year of the Republic of China. Many democratically elected representatives of the National Assembly from various provinces and cities were recruited to jointly discuss national affairs. By the autumn of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the domestic and international situations were both favorable to our war of resistance, and victory was already in sight. The government felt more and more that the post-war national construction should be laid on a solid foundation before the victory. Therefore, when the Fifth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Kuomintang was held in September of that year, a very detailed discussion was held on the issue of implementing constitutional government, and a resolution on the general report on the implementation was passed as follows:

"At the opening of this plenary session, the President instructed and encouraged comrades with "promoting the actual implementation of constitutional government". After listening to the general report on the progress of the implementation of constitutional government, this meeting deeply feels that even in the face of the serious national crisis of the Japanese invasion, the work of implementing constitutional government can still inherit the legacy of the Prime Minister and carry forward the consistent spirit of the Party's decades of sacrifice and struggle for constitutional government, overcome difficulties, and make efforts to move forward. Now that the victory in the war of resistance is in sight and the foundation of constitutional government has been laid, the whole country should concentrate its efforts to strive for victory and consolidate unity, adhere to the spirit of resisting the war and building the country,恪遵the Prime Minister's hand-written provisions of the Outline of National Construction, convene the National Assembly as soon as possible, and promulgate a law that is believed and adhered to by the whole country, in order to complete the great cause of national construction."

In this resolution, it was also announced that the government would convene the National Assembly within one year after the end of the war to formulate a constitution, and the date of implementation would be determined by the National Assembly.

After the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the National Political Council held a meeting in Chongqing. In order to step up the preparations for constitutional government, a resolution was passed at the meeting to recommend to the Supreme National Defense Council the establishment of the "Association for the Promotion of Constitutional Government Implementation". The Supreme National Defense Council accepted this suggestion, and the "Association for the Promotion of Constitutional Government Implementation" was formally established on November 12th of the 32nd year of the Republic of China. On New Year's Day of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, the Association for the Promotion of Constitutional Government Implementation launched the "National People's Discussion on the Draft Constitution Movement". This movement aroused a wide and enthusiastic response. Many issues of the draft constitution, such as the national capital, the rights and obligations of the people, the organization and functions of the National Assembly, and the division of power between the central and local governments, have aroused enthusiastic discussions in various aspects, and have gained many valuable results.

The preparations for constitutional government have gradually reached a mature stage. In May of the 34th year of the Republic of China, the Japanese invaders were retreating on various battlefields. In view of the fact that victory was in sight, the government decided to end the period of political tutelage early, return political power to the people, and implement a democratic constitutional government. Therefore, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang was held in Chongqing and passed a resolution: "The date for the convocation of the National Assembly is set for November 12th of this year." All parties are also stepping up preparations.

In August of the same year, Japan declared unconditional surrender, and the whole country was busy with the work of accepting surrender and returning to civilian life. At that time, the originally scheduled date for the convocation of the National Assembly was approaching, but the domestic political disputes were also becoming increasingly acute. In order to seek stability and unity after the victory, the government did not hesitate to make compromises and convened a Political Consultative Conference of representatives from various parties and social elites to discuss the plan for the country to transition from wartime to peacetime and from resistance to national construction. The Political Consultative Conference opened in Chongqing on January 10th of the 35th year of the Republic of China. Although the scope of its discussions also included issues such as the cessation of military conflicts and the reorganization of the National Government, the most important, most difficult, most contentious, and most delayed resolutions were still the issues of the draft constitution and the National Assembly. The Political Consultative Conference opened on January 10th and closed on the afternoon of the 31st. The most thorny issue of the allocation of additional seats for the National Assembly was only agreed upon at the group meeting that morning.

After the Political Consultative Conference closed, the "Resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference" were published on February 1st, of which items 4 and 5 were related to the draft constitution and the National Assembly. Regarding the draft constitution, the Political Consultative Conference passed a "Principles for Amending the Draft Constitution". As Chairman Chiang pointed out at the closing ceremony of the Political Consultative Conference, this principle of amendment does not have any binding power on the future National Assembly in legal theory, but only provides the National Assembly with "adoption". However, there was an understanding between the various parties in the Political Consultative Conference that everyone would strive to ensure that these principles of amendment could be passed in the future convened National Assembly. Therefore, although these revised principles do not have a legal status, they also have their factual weight. The amending principles are divided into twelve items, but the joint meeting of the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group and the Draft Constitution Review and Consultation Group later proposed three amendments to these amending principles. These two documents are very important, and readers can conduct comparative research and reference.

Regarding the National Assembly, the following eight points were passed in the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference.

(1) The National Assembly will be convened on May 5th of the 35th year of the Republic of China.

(2) The powers of the First National Assembly are to formulate the constitution.

(3) The passage of the constitution requires the consent of three-quarters of the representatives present.

(4) The 1,200 regional and professional representatives stipulated in the election law remain unchanged.

(5) 150 new regional and professional representatives from Taiwan, the Northeast, and other regions will be added.

(6) 700 representatives from parties and social elites will be added. The distribution will be determined separately.

(7) The total number of representatives to the National Assembly is 2,050.

(8) The constitutional organs established in accordance with the Constitution shall be elected and convened in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution within six months of the promulgation of the Constitution.

The allocation of these 700 new representatives in point 6 is written in the resolution as "to be determined separately". It was mentioned above that this issue was the most controversial and the latest to be resolved at the meeting, but although it was not recorded in the resolution, all parties at the meeting had agreed. That is, of the 700 newly added representatives, the Kuomintang accounted for 230, the Communist Party 200, the Democratic League 100, the Youth Party 100, and social elites 70. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party agreed to give up 10 seats each to the Democratic League. So the result was that the Kuomintang had 220, the Communist Party 190, the Democratic League 120, the Youth Party 100, and the social elites 70. This was the tacit understanding of all parties, and it was not recorded in the resolution.

The Task of the Assembly

The convening of the National Assembly on May 5th of the 35th year of the Republic of China was originally passed by the Political Consultative Conference and unanimously agreed by all parties. However, as the convening date approached, the Chinese Communist Party and the Democratic League refused to submit a list of representatives, citing some other reasons, so that some representatives of the National Assembly had to return home in disappointment even though they had arrived in Nanjing to wait for the meeting. In order to implement the original intention of democratic constitutional government, the government could not bear to see the efforts to prepare for constitutional government for more than ten years fall short, so it had to announce the postponement of the National Assembly to November 12th.

Now, the first National Assembly in Chinese history has been scheduled to open in the capital, Nanjing. The task of this National Assembly, as we mentioned briefly in the first section, is to formulate the constitution and determine the date of implementation of the constitution, but does not include the implementation of the constitution. This point seems to need a little explanation so that we can have a true understanding of the goals and tasks of this National Assembly. We know that the constitution is the fundamental law of a country, and it can show the importance and dignity of the constitution by having a specially established body discuss and formulate it in detail from a detached standpoint. In various European and American countries, the procedures for drafting the constitution have also gone through this stage. For example, after the independence of the United States, in 1787, representatives from various states held a constitutional convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The meeting lasted for four months before the draft constitution was completed and submitted to the temporary national assemblies organized by various states for approval. By 1790, the thirteen states had ratified it one after another, and it became the constitution of the United States of America today. For example, the first Republican Constitution after the French Revolution was also formulated by a specially established constitutional body, and then submitted to the citizens for a vote. Furthermore, according to the Organizational Law of the National Assembly, the National Assembly is a constitutional body, which shows that it existed before the constitution. However, the National Assembly that exercises the constitution must be organized in accordance with the provisions of the constitution, which shows that the two are completely different and should not be confused. If the National Assembly established without following the constitution can exercise the powers of the National Assembly stipulated in the constitution, it is legally untenable. Therefore, the constitutional body and the constitutional body must be separated. Secondly, the draft constitution is drafted by the Legislative Yuan, promulgated by the government, and the people can fully express their opinions and make amendments. The transmission of the people's opinions must naturally go through the representatives of the National Assembly elected by the people during the discussion. The National Assembly has a meeting period of only twenty days. If, in addition to drafting the constitution, it is also necessary to show the various issues of implementing the constitution, it may not be possible in fact. Finally, Article 23 of the Outline of National Construction also stipulates that "when more than half of the provinces in the country have reached the beginning of the constitutional government, that is, the completion of local autonomy in the whole province, the National Assembly shall be opened to formulate and promulgate the constitution." It can be seen that the National Assembly is an institution that existed before the constitution, and its task is to formulate the constitution and not to implement the constitution, which is the legacy of the Founding Father. Therefore, this National Assembly should be called the "Constitutional Convention" or the "Constitutional Assembly" in essence. The real National Assembly must be organized according to Chapter 3 of the Constitution after the Constitution is formally passed. Therefore, in this conference, Chapter 3 of the Constitution concerning the articles of the "National Assembly" is likely to become the center of heated debate.

During these twenty days, the highest code of law for the founding of the Republic of China will be produced, the preamble to the democratic constitutional government, the ultimate goal of the national revolution, will be unveiled, and China will be led to a new historical step. Today, the eyes of 450 million people in China will be on Nanjing, on these more than 2,000 representatives. The National Assembly bears such a sacred and important task, let us wish it complete success in advance.

### News Reporter Air Force Second Lieutenant Bao Wei Zhu Jingnong Follows Wang Xiaolai National Assembly Representatives Report

Zhu Jingnong made a special trip to Nanjing to report. As soon as he arrived at the reporting office, he was surrounded by a group of reporters, talking about the operation of the Commercial Press. When he went through the formalities, he was all smiles. The seat he drew was No. 525, and Yun said: "Fortunately, fortunately, it's not too far."

Among the representatives who have reported, there are the most legislators. Obviously, these legislative experts will definitely show their skills in this conference.

The number drawn by Wang Xiaolai was 1478. There was a young military officer wearing a military uniform and an air force second lieutenant next to him. After he went upstairs to go through the formalities and collect the food and accommodation expenses for him, he walked out the door. Wang talked to him in a low voice with a kind and amiable attitude. Some people said that he might be his young master. (Special Correspondent Ding Kuanghua)

### The Evolution of the Organizational Law of the National Assembly and the Election Law of Representatives Chen Yuxiang

(The above article continues from page 14)

As for why people oppose the validity of the old representatives? The reason can be represented by the five propositions on the National Assembly issued by the Democratic League on March 10th of the 34th year of the Republic of China. The main points are summarized as follows:

1. In the recent eight or nine years, China has experienced an unprecedented foreign war in history, and the world has experienced an unprecedented war, which has had a profound impact on people's psychology and their political awareness. It is practically impossible to use the representatives elected eight or nine years ago to reflect the public opinion that has undergone great changes in the past eight or nine years. Moreover, the draft constitution promulgated by the National Government clearly stipulates that the term of office of the National Assembly representatives is six years. It is only because after six years, the people's intentions cannot but have great changes, and it is natural that their representatives should be re-elected. If the representatives elected in the 24th and 25th years of the Republic of China are still valid, they have exceeded the term of office stipulated in the constitution. If the first National Assembly representatives who have the right to enact the constitution take the lead in setting this bad precedent of violating the spirit of constitutional government, what kind of bad impression will it give the people? This is one.

2. According to the provisions of the National Assembly Representative Election Law, citizens who are 20 years old have the right to vote, and citizens who are 25 years old have the right to be elected. After these eight or nine years, all citizens who were 11 or 12 years old before the war have obtained their legal right to vote today, and all citizens who were 15 or 16 years old before the war have obtained their legal right to be elected today. The total number of both is no less than 30 million. Moreover, these young people are actually the ones who have contributed the most to the war of resistance. The first National Assembly convened to lay the foundation for the country's autonomy and constitutional government has deprived these people of their right to vote and be elected. It is unacceptable in terms of reason and emotion. This is two.

3. After eight years of war of resistance, the situation in various regions has changed greatly compared with before the war. If the feelings of the people in these regions are ignored, and the representatives produced before the war are still used to make various decisions that the people of the whole country must abide by, if the people in these regions rise up and complain when the conference is held, saying that these old representatives are no longer sufficient to represent the recent public opinion in these regions, will the representatives who have attended the conference and have a legal relationship with these regions not be caught in a dilemma? The adverse effects on the country are also innumerable. This is three.

4. When the elections were held in the 24th and 25th years of the Republic of China, it was still the time when the party power was at its peak. At that time, few parties had the opportunity to participate in the elections, and even people from all walks of life who were usually respected in society had little chance of being elected as representatives of the National Assembly. Even some wise people within the Kuomintang were dissatisfied with the election situation at that time. Now that times have changed and the world is in a high tide of democracy, which has come with the force of overwhelming force, and the urgent demand of the times is that the whole country must unite to overcome difficulties together. If we ignore the facts mentioned above and still use the old representatives produced eight or nine years ago to deal with the current difficult and difficult new situation, the so-called democratic unity is just empty talk. This is four.

5. The day when the National Assembly opens should be the time when the Kuomintang's party power temporarily comes to an end. However, according to Article 3 of the Organizational Law of the National Assembly, the executive and supervisory members and alternate executive and supervisory members of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang are the natural representatives of the National Assembly. According to the facts mentioned above, the election held nine years ago was originally presided over by the Kuomintang alone. Now, with the addition of these hundreds of natural representatives, will the atmosphere of one party in the future conference not be a little thick? In case the people do not understand, and suspect that "returning power to the people" is only nominal, and "legalizing party power is the actual requirement of the Kuomintang", how will the wise people within the Kuomintang explain themselves? This is five. The propositions of the Democratic League's declaration are actually the arguments of the Communist Party. As for whether these propositions have their reasons, we will not spend any time here to analyze them one by one. Readers only need to read the context of this article to understand. However, the spread of these views has hindered the convocation of the National Assembly, which is an undeniable fact. In August of the 34th year of the Republic of China, the war of resistance against Japan ended in victory, and the National Assembly was about to be convened. The Communist Party attempted to create internal chaos, so the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party were held openly. On October 10th of the same year, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party issued a summary of the talks, stating that whether the National Assembly representatives should be re-elected and whether the Organizational Law of the National Assembly and the Election Law of Representatives should be amended should be decided by the Political Consultative Conference. The Political Consultative Conference opened in Chongqing on January 10th of the 35th year of the Republic of China, and the case of the National Assembly was one of the most debated issues at the conference.

Various Opinions in the Political Consultative Conference

When the Political Consultative Conference held its seventh meeting on January 17th, the issue of the National Assembly was included in the agenda of the day, and the discussion continued on the 18th. In the Political Consultative Conference, the opinions of all parties on the qualifications of the National Assembly representatives can be divided into (1) the old representatives are valid, (2) the old representatives are invalid, and (3) the conciliation plan.

First, the Kuomintang advocated that the old representatives should continue to be valid. At the meeting on the 17th, Zhang Lisheng first explained the Kuomintang delegation's views on the National Assembly, totaling four points: (1) The National Assembly will be convened on May 5th of the 35th year of the Republic of China; (2) The powers of the First National Assembly are to formulate the constitution; (3) The remaining number of representatives of the First National Assembly, in addition to those who have been elected, can be reasonably increased; (4) The Second National Assembly will be elected and convened in accordance with the provisions of the constitution within six months of the promulgation of the constitution. Regarding the validity of the old representatives, it is believed that it cannot be denied. Zhang's words meant that there is a view in society that the National Assembly representatives who have been elected should be re-elected. Our government and the ruling party also attach great importance to this view and have considered it, but as a result of consideration, there is no reason not to recognize the qualifications of the representatives who have been elected in accordance with the law in the past. There are two reasons: one is based on legal theory, and the other is based on reason and the current political situation. First of all, from the first point, we cannot find a basis in law. We see that Article 1 of the amended Organizational Law of the National Assembly stipulates that "the National Assembly formulates the constitution and determines the date of implementation of the constitution." Article 11 stipulates that "the National Assembly ends its mission after the end of the meeting." According to these two articles, the power of the National Assembly is to formulate the constitution and determine the date of implementation of the constitution. The National Assembly representatives only have this task, and there is no term of office. The government has no legal basis to remove it. Secondly, from the second point, looking at the general trend in the current political situation, what the country hopes for at present is unity and stability. The purpose of convening the Political Consultative Conference is to negotiate. Assuming that the government or any party does not recognize the qualifications of the nine hundred and several representatives who have been elected in accordance with the law in the past, and re-elect them, imagine what these hundreds of representatives will feel psychologically? Today, we believe that various parties have not been able to fully agree on their political views in the past, and we still have to painstakingly convene the Political Consultative Conference by the government. Then, whether the qualifications of these nine hundred and several representatives are recognized or cancelled, will they also organize a group, for example, organize a National Assembly Party, and express its views and wishes to the government in the same way as other parties, and then hold one or even several meetings? How will the government deal with it? Therefore, the government has no basis in law, and it cannot but recognize that the representatives elected in the past are valid in terms of reason and the current political situation.

Chen Lifu expressed his long opinion on the issue of the National Assembly at the Political Consultative Conference (this was his first speech at the Political Consultative Conference), in which he said that Article 2, Item 4 of the Election Law, which stipulates that the government designates 240 representatives, is a remedial measure. Although this method is not absolutely good, it is suitable for China's national conditions, because China is different from Europe and the United States. Those who are qualified to be elected and should be elected often regard themselves as noble and unwilling to run for election, so this method must be used to remedy it. As for the term of office of the representatives, the original text does not explicitly stipulate it, so there is controversy. Some people say that the representatives elected ten years ago have already expired according to the six-year term stipulated in the draft constitution, but they do not know that the term of office should be calculated from the date of assumption of office. Now the National Assembly has not yet been convened, and they have not yet assumed office, so the term of office has not only not expired, but has not actually begun. Moreover, the war of resistance has lasted for eight years, and the failure of the old representatives to take office is a special circumstance. As for the draft constitution, it has not yet been passed in accordance with the law, and it cannot be used to restrict the term of office of the representatives.

Wu Tiecheng made supplementary comments on maintaining the old representatives, saying that the reasons for opposing the old representatives are nothing more than two points: one is that the representatives elected in the 25th year of the Republic of China are not sufficient to represent today's public opinion, and the other is that many people who did not have the right to vote or be elected in those years have now obtained it, and their rights should not be deprived. Regarding the first point, the representatives elected in those years have mostly participated in the war of resistance and service in the past eight years. Their experience and understanding have been improved, and they are more able to represent public opinion. Regarding the second point, the number of people who have obtained the right to vote or be elected today cannot exceed the number of people who had the right to vote or be elected in those years. We should not only take care of the rights of a few people, but not recognize the election results of those who have obtained the right to vote.

Second, the Communist Party and the Democratic League did not recognize the validity of the old representatives. Their reasons for opposing the old representatives have been seen in the declaration of the Democratic League mentioned in the previous section, and their views held in the Political Consultative Conference are still based on this as the main content. Deng Yingchao also raised issues such as the complicated procedures for selecting representatives in the Representative Election Law. Wu Yuzhang, Zhang Junli, Guo Moruo, and others put forward the view that we cannot talk about legal principles, but must take into account the facts. If we talk about legal principles, the Political Consultative Conference is not based on law. The Political Consultative Conference is now being held because of the needs of the facts. Re-electing the old representatives is also a need of the facts, so the theory of legal principles cannot be established. Guo Moruo said that the government wants to maintain the validity of the old representatives because it is afraid that the old representatives will speak and cause social instability; various parties want to re-elect representatives because they are also afraid of causing social instability and the people want to speak. Luo Longji, representing the Democratic League, put forward the following points: (1) If the old representatives are maintained, a public opinion poll must be held, which will be held by intellectuals such as industry and commerce, culture, and students; (2) The old representatives should be used as candidates to hold miscellaneous elections; (3) The National Assembly should not be held, and experts should draft the constitution and the citizens should vote. It goes without saying that the method is impractical.

Third, Wang Yunwu and Shao Congen, who were non-partisan, put forward two other conciliation plans. Wang said that the government has difficulties, which is a fact, and the Communist Party's criticism is also correct. He believed that law and facts should be taken into account. He believed that the foundation of democracy lies in the rule of law. If the law is ignored, this kind of democracy is unreliable. The spirit of the rule of law is that the people should abide by the law, and the government should also abide by the law. The government cannot arbitrarily negate the law, otherwise it will conflict with the democratic position. He admitted that there is a defect in the National Assembly Organizational Law, that is, the representatives do not have a fixed term of office, and there is no way to cancel the qualifications of the representatives. He agreed to amend it, but the representatives elected in the past cannot but be maintained. Because the Kuomintang wants to return power to the people, it has the right to make a decision on how to deal with it. In addition, there are 250 representatives who have not been elected, so there are 950 seats that can be manipulated. Shao Congen advocated that the opposition parties should make concessions to the ruling party on the issue of old representatives. He also put forward a method that he said he had thought of after a night of hard thinking, that is, to solve this problem with three meetings from now on: (1) The first meeting is the Political Consultative Conference, whose task is for various parties to jointly formulate the steps to start democracy, draft and amend the National Assembly Organizational Law and Election Law, and even the Outline of the Draft Constitution, and submit a proposal; (2) The second meeting is still held on May 5th according to the government's proposal, and the Organizational Law, Election Law, and Draft Constitution that we have amended will be submitted to the conference for discussion and decision as the formal Organizational Law, Election Law, and Draft Constitution. (3) The third meeting is the meeting established according to the Organizational Law and Election Law decided by the second meeting, and its task is to draft and implement the constitution.

Under the circumstances that the National Assembly issue was discussed for two days without reaching a conclusion, as mentioned above, each party held its own views.

The Issue of Allocation of Seats for Various Parties

The debate on the National Assembly case in the Political Consultative Conference initially centered on the issue of whether the old representatives should be retained or abolished, and then involved the issue of the allocation of seats for various parties. On January 28th, the Democratic League still firmly believed that the legal system could not be recognized, but the need for political unity should be recognized. It advocated a political solution and attached importance to the guarantee of agreements such as the principles for amending the draft constitution (that is, it required the government to guarantee that the May 5th National Assembly could accept the principles for amending the draft constitution agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference). Based on this so-called "political compromise" principle, the Democratic League recognized that the old representatives could be selected as a party by the Kuomintang, and the parties and non-parties should separately select new representatives. The Democratic League also proposed that the number of newly added representatives elected by the parties and non-parties should account for more than one-third of the total number, with the intention of ensuring that the new draft constitution would not be vetoed by the May 5th Congress, because at this time more than two-thirds of the representatives in the Political Consultative Conference had agreed to the provision that the draft constitution could not be passed. Due to the failure of the Kuomintang to agree to the above opinions, no agreement was reached. As for the various parties' scramble for representative seats, it was even more impossible to have any results. According to the original plan, the Political Consultative Conference was scheduled to close on January 23rd. Due to the difficulty of agreeing on various issues, it was repeatedly extended. As of the morning of the 31st, four of the five issues had been agreed upon three days ago, and only the National Assembly issue was still deadlocked. On this day, Zhou Enlai returned to Chongqing after asking the CCP Central Committee for instructions from Yan'an, so it was decided to hold a joint meeting of the Comprehensive Group and the National Assembly Group. The National Assembly issue was resolved at this point. The Political Consultative Conference also closed on the evening of January 31st. The report of the National Assembly Subcommittee of the Political Consultative Conference was adopted as follows.

This group was entrusted to discuss the "National Assembly Issue". After consulting the "Opinions on the National Assembly" submitted by Sun Fo and other eight members, we held six meetings and a joint meeting with the Comprehensive Subcommittee to discuss in detail. We have achieved results. We respectfully submit this report and respectfully ask for a public decision. Conveners: Yu Jiaju, Deng Yingchao. 1. The National Assembly will be convened on May 5th of the 35th year of the Republic of China. 2. The powers of the First National Assembly are to formulate the constitution. 3. The passage of the constitution requires the consent of three-quarters of the representatives present. 4. The 1,200 regional and professional representatives stipulated in the election law remain unchanged. 5. 150 new regional and professional representatives will be added from regions such as Taiwan and the Northeast. 6. 700 representatives from parties and social elites will be added, and their distribution will be determined separately. 7. The total number of representatives to the National Assembly is 2,050. 8. The constitutional organs established in accordance with the Constitution shall be elected and convened in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution within six months of the promulgation of the Constitution.

When we read the report of the Political Consultative Conference, one is to stipulate that the National Assembly will be convened on May 5th, and the other is to stipulate that the powers of the National Assembly are to formulate the constitution. These were all the wishes of the government, the efforts made, the orders made, the laws made, and what the government proposed in the Political Consultative Conference. Regarding the number of representatives of the National Assembly, the government originally only hoped to maintain the old representatives and make reasonable additions to the new representatives. As a result of the consultation, not only were the 900 and several representatives who had been elected recognized as valid, but the 200 and several who had not been elected were still publicly elected by the government. In addition, 700 representatives from various parties and non-parties and 150 representatives from Taiwan, the Northeast, and other regions were added, and the natural representatives and designated representatives were cancelled. This kind of reasonable addition has actually been announced by the government long ago. The remaining question is how these 700 representatives should be allocated. The Communist Party said that the total number of their representatives should be half of the total number of representatives of the Kuomintang. The Youth Party first said that their representatives should be one-tenth of the total number, and then overturned the ratio they had proposed and demanded that the party should elect 500 representatives; At the same time, various parties and factions demanded that they account for one-third of the total number of representatives, and on the other hand, the Communist Party separately demanded that they account for one-quarter of the total number. In addition to these disputes over the proportion of seats, they also demanded that the Kuomintang should guarantee that the representatives of a certain party must account for a certain percentage. After the closing of the Political Consultative Conference, there were repeated consultations, and it was finally decided that the allocation of 700 representative seats for parties and social elites was: 220 for the Kuomintang, 190 for the Communist Party, 100 for the Democratic League, 120 for the Youth Party, and 70 for non-partisan individuals.

The evolution of the Organizational Law of the National Assembly and the Election Law of Representatives has thus become fixed.

### 跑馬總會債券償還　地院判決千倍計算　原告所持理由根據地產銀價不能作爲標準

[Our Report] In the case of holders of bonds issued by the Race Club in the 23rd year of the Republic of China requesting repayment at one thousand times the face value, the District Court's Sixth Civil Chamber, presided over by Judge Xu Fuji, delivered its verdict at 10:00 AM yesterday: The defendant, the Race Club's legal representative and former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, F.C. Maitland, etc., should repay each plaintiff for the bonds at a rate of one thousand times their face value. Specifically, Dibais, holding bonds worth 17,000 Legal Tender, should be repaid 17 million Legal Tender. Marc Far, holding bonds worth 10,000 Legal Tender, should be repaid 10 million Legal Tender. Su Meng, holding bonds worth 4,200 Legal Tender, should be repaid 4.2 million Legal Tender. Baobaer, holding bonds worth 100 Legal Tender, should be repaid 100,000 Legal Tender. Judge Xu further explained the reasons, stating that according to Article 12 of the Supplementary Civil Procedure Regulations after the restoration, the court should consider the actual situation and make a fair judgment. The two points raised by the plaintiff regarding real estate and silver prices are insufficient to be the basis. The current real estate market is also extremely sluggish and difficult to sell, and the silver currency system has long been abolished. The current black market price cannot be used as a standard either. Therefore, the court, in consideration of all aspects of the situation, has decided to repay at a rate of one thousand times. Both parties can appeal if they disagree with the judgment. According to Cai Wenda, the lawyer representing the defendant, who told the reporter, "The judgment of one thousand times cannot be said to be too heavy, nor can it be said to be too light. It is a matter of opinion, and everyone's point of view is different. The defendant will study the judgment after receiving the written verdict and then decide whether to file an appeal."

### 吳市長邀集總工會理事解釋生活指數　並謀求勞資協調共渡難關

Mayor Wu convened a forum at 4:30 PM yesterday in the City Hall conference room, gathering executive directors of the General Labor Union and the responsible personnel of the Cost of Living Index Compilation Research Committee. Mayor Wu first addressed the meeting, stating: "I sympathize with the workers the most. This is indeed due to the circumstances. Now that the national industry and commerce are about to enter a recession, the municipal government should find ways to reduce this factor." He then gave a detailed explanation of why the price index is not the same as the cost of living index, stating: "The price index includes all kinds of consumer goods, while the cost of living index is compiled based on the goods necessary for the general public. Therefore, there are differences. What is statistically announced in this city is the necessary cost of living index, not the price index." Finally, he declared that the urgent task is labor-management coordination to overcome difficulties together and achieve development. Subsequently, Shui Xiangyun, Zhang Zhusan, and others spoke successively, resolving to seek labor-management coordination to overcome difficulties together.

### 現行指數絕非假造　市長再度聲明

[Our Report] Mayor Wu, at 5:30 PM yesterday, accepted an invitation from the Liaison Association of the Law School of Aurora University in this city and went to the school to give a speech. Because Mayor Wu had just held a meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday in the City Hall conference room with representatives of the General Labor Union, etc., to explain in detail the issue of the workers' cost of living index, he rushed to Aurora University to give a speech after the meeting. Therefore, the content of his speech took the cost of living index as a guide, saying that the current cost of living index in this city has a correct basis and is by no means fabricated, and that the life of workers is indeed superior to that before the war. It seems that there should be no more excessive demands, and he frequently advised students to always take "the country above all else" and "the nation first" as principles, and to work hard forever, and hoped that the civil war could end soon and China could achieve peaceful reunification.

### 于瑞熹談臺灣貿易　糖產缺乏資金發展非易

[Our Report] Yu Ruixi, Director of the Taiwan Trade Bureau, recently came to Shanghai on business and spoke to reporters yesterday about the general situation of the bureau, saying: "The Trade Bureau was established in November last year. In addition to the Taiwan headquarters, there are offices in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Japan, and the Trust Department of the Provincial Bank is entrusted in Fuzhou, and the China Vegetable Oil Factory is entrusted in Tianjin as agents. The main business is to export local products from the province and import necessary materials under the instructions of the Chief Executive's Office, in order to maintain the activities of industry and commerce. In addition, materials are exchanged with Japan through the Central Trust Bureau. In the past year, the main imports have been more than 10,000 tons of soybean cake and other fertilizers, more than 100,000 bolts of cloth, and more than 100 vehicles. The main exports, in addition to Taiwan Sugar, are Formosa tea, camphor, and fruit. The latest batch of barter materials with Japan includes more than 1,000 bags of flax seeds departing from Osaka. As for Taiwan's general industry, it has not fully recovered. Taking the most important sugar industry as an example, the current monthly production is only a few thousand tons. The main difficulty is the lack of funds and the difficulty of turnover. Yu believes that development will not be easy without absorbing foreign funds. In addition, the soybean cake and other fertilizers transported from the mainland, although still applicable to the soil of Taiwan Province, are too costly, costing 400,000 to 500,000 Legal Tender per ton, while the higher quality American fertilizer powder costs only about 300,000 Legal Tender per ton. Therefore, the bureau has recently ordered 200,000 tons of fertilizer powder from UNRRA."

[Our Report] The Sanbei Steamship Company has resumed business in Shanghai after the victory. The Changxing, Mingxing, Yongjia, Ruitai, and Yuanhengli Liang vessels have been successively repaired and resumed navigation. Recently, the Long'an vessel, which was berthed in Chongqing, was towed to Shanghai for repairs. The repairs have now been completed, and the trial run the day before yesterday was successful. It is berthed at the Dada Wharf in Nanshi. Last night, a banquet was held on the ship to entertain guests until around 9:00 PM, when the host and guests dispersed happily. The vessel has a gross tonnage of 1,500 tons and a cargo capacity of 1,000 tons. After this repair, the passenger cabins were refurbished and repainted. The special class can accommodate 20 people, the first class 24 people, and the third class 154 people. The third-class equipment is equivalent to the second class, because the vessel does not have second or fourth-class equipment. It will set sail for Hankou for the first time at dawn this morning, and both cargo and passengers are fully booked.

The Java Company's Zhida Jia arrived in Shanghai on the 9th and set sail for Java yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, loading more than 100 tons of UNRRA goods to Hong Kong, with more than 600 passengers, most of whom are going to Hong Kong.

The China Union Company's Hualian vessel returned to Shanghai from Tianjin this time and arrived at Wusongkou on the evening of the 10th.

It has been rescheduled to set sail for Qinhuangdao next Thursday afternoon. The reason for the change to Qinhuangdao, it is said, is that there is a shortage of new fuel and beverages. If it is transshipped from Tianjin, it will delay the shipping schedule and be uneconomical.
