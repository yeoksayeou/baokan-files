[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 14th] The section between Pingquan and Chengde on the Jin Gu Line was severely damaged by the Communist Army, and it is feared that it will not be fully repaired for two months. The Communist Army planted many landmines in Chengde, and explosions are frequently heard. Although there are rumors that a regiment of the Communist Army is lurking in the city, the local area is extremely peaceful due to strict defense. Prices are gradually increasing, but they are still cheaper than in other places. A dou (30 jin) of rice sells for 600 Northeastern Circulation Notes, local flour costs 35 yuan per jin, pork costs 40 yuan per jin. Daily necessities are extremely scarce, but merchants are quick to act. Jinzhou cigarettes and towels have appeared on the streets. The Eighth Route Army currency has ceased circulation, and the Northeastern Circulation Notes are circulating on the market. The general public is in a very difficult situation. The relief supplies from Madame Chiang Kai-shek for the Northeastern refugees have been distributed to 500 people, with each person receiving 500 Circulation Notes. The refugees are very grateful.

He used a cane to climb mountains such as the Daliu Road and the Rizhao Peak to inspect and find a small base on Lushan for helicopters, which are about to enter a wide application stage. The inspection results showed that there is no suitable, ideal place for reconstruction. The general believes that although future helicopter takeoffs and landings do not require large airports, it is best to choose a flat-topped highland with sparse trees and few houses. He has presented this opinion to Military Attache Xia to forward to the President.

### American Soldiers Search Residents' Homes in Qinhuangdao; This Act Is Detrimental to Sino-US Relations

[United Press, Tianjin, 14th] The Dagongbao published an article in its "Readers' Letters" column, stating that its Qinhuangdao residence was searched by three American military police officers on the 8th of this month, and no Chinese police accompanied them at the time. This kind of behavior by the American military police is an infringement of Chinese sovereignty and is detrimental to Sino-US relations.

According to the US military authorities, this was unintentional. Cao has been hospitalized for treatment after being injured.

### US Ambassador Talks About Current Situation; Resolves to Work with Marshal Ma to Promote Peace; Met with Zhou Enlai Yesterday and Visited President Song

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Zhou Enlai visited US Ambassador Stuart at 10:30 AM on the 14th by appointment, and only left after talking for two hours. Afterwards, according to the spokesperson of the Communist Party delegation, what was discussed today was still the three-man military conference, and a ceasefire must come first before other matters can be discussed. He also formally expressed to Ambassador Stuart on the 14th that he refused to participate in the informal five-person group meeting, believing that the meeting could not solve the problem and was meaningless. The matter of reorganizing the government committee's quota was only a few words on the point of the fourteen places that the Communist Party agreed to, and there was no need to hold a meeting to discuss it. When asked by reporters what attitude the Communist Party would take if the five-person group meeting and the three-man military conference were held at the same time, the spokesperson said: The Communist Party will not participate, and it is also impossible.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] After receiving Zhou Enlai on the 14th, Ambassador Stuart and his personal advisor Fu Jingbo went to Beijige to attend a lunch banquet hosted by President Song. In the afternoon, at 6:00 PM, he went out in response to a friend's invitation, and Fu visited Wu Tiecheng at the same time for talks.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Regarding the United Press report that "Marshal Ma has refused to accept the CCP's request to reopen the three-man military group meeting," the reporter specifically asked Ambassador Stuart about this on the 14th. The ambassador said: This statement is half right and half wrong, because we are still seeking an appropriate way to achieve our original intention, and political consultations must be effective before the three-man military conference can be raised again. He also said: If there is something to be gained politically, then the remaining problems will be easily solved. The reporter then asked what the ambassador thought of the statement made by Wu Tiecheng, the government representative to the informal five-person group meeting, that "the meeting has not failed." The ambassador replied: "That's right," and I also believe that it has not failed. At this point, the existence of the five-person meeting was further confirmed. The ambassador then smiled and said: "The current situation is still hopeful." When asked again by the reporter whether the ambassador would continue to make efforts in this direction, the ambassador said: "I am still working hard. I am more anxious than anyone else. I want to see a new development every day, but until now, it has not been time to announce it."

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Authoritative sources say: Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart both suggested convening an informal five-person group first, and then convening a three-man military conference, to achieve a ceasefire and peace. At first, both sides of the informal five-person meeting had appointed representatives, but then the Communist Party refused to participate, using the US's granting of surplus materials as an excuse. If the five-person meeting can be held, starting with political issues and proceeding gradually, it is possible to reach a ceasefire. Some people doubt that if the government's five demands are mentioned again during the informal five-person meeting, what will happen? It is said that if this happens, the three-man military conference can be convened at the same time, so that military and political issues can be addressed simultaneously.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] According to reliable sources, Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart have been working tirelessly to promote peace. After Marshal Ma went to Lushan eight times, Ambassador Stuart continued to contact the government and Communist Party representatives, hoping to break the deadlock amid numerous obstacles. When the ambassador met with reporters at 5:30 PM this afternoon, he said optimistically: "I am more anxious about the current situation than you, but the negotiations have not yet broken down, and hope has not been extinguished." The ambassador also said, "Marshal Ma and I share the same view, that we should start with political issues and then resolve military issues." The ambassador finally said, "Marshal Ma and I will work tirelessly, even if the five-person group is suspended, we will find other ways."

### Mei Siping, Traitor, Executed by Firing Squad in Beijing; Left Words to Children: "Strive to Study and Serve the Country"

— Our Beijing Correspondent, Pu Dejie

Yesterday morning at 9:50 AM, in the northeastern corner of the grassy grounds of the Capital Prison at Tiger Bridge, Zhujiang Road, Nanjing, with a "bang," the major traitor Mei Siping fell. One year after the victory, on the ravaged and desolate land of Nanjing, the blood of ugliness and treachery was shed for the first time. At 7:25 AM, Mei was awakened from his dream by a bailiff. "The Warden wants to speak with you," he was told. He neatly put on his white spun silk shirt, bluish-gray trousers, and thin-soled black gauze shoes. He stepped out of Loyal Prison, Number Four. He saw the gloomy sky overhead, the gleam of greedy reporters' cameras in front of him, and the merciless earth beneath his feet. His face turned ashen. He understood. "Why didn't you tell me earlier? I haven't said goodbye to my friends. Please bring me a package of books and letters." At that moment, a simple courtroom had been set up in a hall. Chen Shengzu, Prosecutor of the Capital High Court, sat in the center, Prison Warden Kong Xiangxian on the left, and Clerk Jiang Fucheng on the right. The final questioning began: "Are you Mei Siping?" "Yes." "How old are you?" "Fifty years old." "Where are you from?" "Yongjia County, Zhejiang Province." "Where do you live?" "Originally at Number 42, Beiping Road." "Were you imprisoned for being a traitor?" "Yes." "Was the death sentence handed down by the Capital High Court?" "Yes." "Very well. Now, the Capital High Court Procuratorate, acting on instructions forwarded by the Supreme Court Procuratorate and on the order of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, has rejected your appeal, and the execution is to be carried out immediately. Do you understand?" Mei nodded silently. "You don't need to say anything more now. Do you have any last words for your family and friends?" "I do." Mei took the white cloth bundle that the bailiff brought him. "I have already written three letters, but I haven't signed and dated them yet. May I write them now?" "You may." So the bailiff moved the official case documents aside, and Mei bent over the table and wrote his name on each letter. The first one was to be forwarded to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek through Minister Xie Guansheng. It was three pages long, beginning with "Respectfully, Chairman Chiang..." and containing phrases such as "the future of the Chinese nation." The second letter was to Minister Xie and two Vice Ministers, Hong Ludong and Xie Zhou. Mei said, "I am good friends with those three. This letter is to thank them for their friendship and to ask them to forward my letter to the Chairman." The third letter was for his family, one for his brothers, reading, "Zufang, Zuyin, my two brothers, I die for the country, for the two hundred million people in the occupied areas. My conscience is clear... Read extensively the history of the Southern and Northern Dynasties, the Song, Qi, Liang, and Later Wei dynasties..." A couplet for his wife read, "Shouxiang, I have never done anything bad in my life. I have never done anything against my conscience... I hope you will educate our children well and make them useful to society and the country..." For his children, there was a hanging scroll with the eight characters: "Strive to study, loyally serve the country." Prosecutor Chen accepted them one by one, telling him, "I will certainly deliver them all for you." At this moment, Mei said, "I have two requests. First, whether the execution be by shooting or hanging. Second, not to be bound. I also ask the court to instruct its staff not to desecrate my body after my death." The Prosecutor said, "We will try our best to minimize your suffering on the first point, and you need not worry on the second point. Is there anything else you want to say?" "I deeply regret not having said goodbye to my friends who live with me. Also, please tell my family to bury me in Nanjing if possible." Prosecutor Chen nodded, picked up his pen, and heavily wrote the four characters "Death Sentence Executed" on the execution order, drawing a line above and below the three characters "Mei Siping." Two bailiffs helped Mei out of the courtroom, into the empty grassy area behind the prison, and towards the northeast corner of the prison wall. At this point, Chief Constable Zhu Kunfeng, the executioner, raised the Number Two pistol in his hand, and with a "bang," the bullet entered from the back of the head and exited from the right nostril. A gush of blood spurted out, staining a patch of the clean green grass. Mei Siping ended his absurd life. At 10:30 AM, District Court Prosecutor Wang Shaozeng, forensic doctor Ying Cai, and Inspector Song Shihau led bailiffs to examine the body. At 10:40 AM, Mei's younger brother, Mei Zufang, came to discuss the arrangements for collecting the body. Mei said that his brother's family, except for his eldest daughter, Mei Aiwen, who had left the family, were all in their hometown of Wenzhou. Mei Siping's funeral arrangements would be handled by him. At 11:00 AM, the hearse from the China Funeral Parlor took the body of this major traitor out of the back gate of the Dashiqiao Prison. As it passed the back window of "Loyal Prison," several major traitors, led by Lin Bosheng, bowed to pay their respects. These incorrigibly stubborn elements must have had a sense of "the rabbit mourns the fox's death." (Dispatch from Nanjing, 14th)

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] Major traitor Mei Siping was executed by firing squad on the morning of the 14th. Since the Capital High Court began trying traitors, Mei is the first to be executed. Mei was one of the major traitors in the puppet regime, serving successively as minister of various puppet organizations, including the Minister of Propaganda, Minister of Industry and Commerce, Minister of Interior, and Governor of Zhejiang Province, among other important positions. Moreover, he was one of the earliest participants in the aforementioned initial conspiracy to collude with the enemy. The Capital High Court sentenced him to death three months ago, during which time the defendant's family applied for retrial twice, but both were rejected by the court.

Military Traitor Li Zhigan Executed by Firing Squad

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] Military traitor Li Zhigan was sentenced to death for the crimes of gathering crowds for riots and colluding with the enemy to purchase grain. He was stripped of his civil rights for life, and all his property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, was confiscated. The sentence was pronounced at 3:00 PM on the 14th, and the convict was immediately taken to the execution ground and executed by firing squad.

### Intense Debate in the Legislative Yuan on the Organization of the Supreme Economic Council; Generally Considered Unnecessary, Resolution Postponed

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] The Legislative Yuan held its 307th regular meeting at 9:00 AM on the 14th. Sixty-three members of the Legislative Yuan were present, presided over by Speaker Sun. After the report items, the following were discussed: (1) Re-examination of the draft Standard Law, resolved and passed. (2) Draft Organization Law of the Supreme Economic Council, resolution postponed. (3) Draft revised articles of the Income Tax Law, resolved and passed as amended. (4) Draft revised articles 9 and 15 of the Organization Law of the National Government Military Council, resolved and passed. (5) Proposal by Legislative Yuan member Chen Anren: drafting a jury system bill, resolved to be submitted to the Joint Committee on Civil and Criminal Law for study. (6) Revision of the wartime national budget compilation and review methods and subject table, revised budget bill, resolved and passed. (7) Draft revised articles of the regulations on compensation and retirement for school teachers and staff, resolved not to be revised and passed according to the review opinions. (8) Draft revised Transaction Tax Law, resolved and passed. (9) The Finance Committee, together with the Economic Committee and the Commercial Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan, reported on the work of the nine-member committee on finance, economy, and commercial law, resolved to re-examine. Temporary motions: (1) Proposed by Liu Buming, Chen Changqiang, and 14 others, to be reviewed by the Supreme National Defense Council upon the recommendation of the Legislative Yuan. (2) Proposed by Liu Buming and nine others: the tax exemption amount of the Income Tax Law should be adjusted at any time according to the average price index, resolved to be submitted to the Finance Committee for review.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] In today's Legislative Yuan regular meeting, the most intense debate was on whether or not to pass the draft Organization Law of the Supreme Economic Council. Several members advocated rejecting the proposal, for the following reasons: (1) The national economy is in difficulty, and the organization of this council is too large, seemingly established only for certain bureaucrats; (2) This council seems to be a reincarnation of the Production Bureau, but the Production Bureau was still under the Executive Yuan, while this council directly reports to the National Government. Now that the circumstances have changed, it would be best to abolish it; (3) Establishing this institution will not increase the efficiency of the Executive Yuan, but rather reduce it, and even if there is such an institution, it is not enough to increase international prestige; (4) The various departments under this council are equivalent to the relevant economic departments under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, and the personnel are also the same, as if there were two Executive Yuans; (5) Such a dictatorial economic council is unheard of in the world, and it should not exist in theory, and it is equivalent to non-existence in practice; (6) National revitalization should have a grand spirit, and setting up an institution for private individuals is petty; (7) The country has already consumed a great deal, and if this proposal is passed again, the consumption will be even greater, so the Legislative Yuan should immediately propose its abolition to reduce the burden on the people. The above arguments all advocated rejection, and were proposed by members such as Liu Buming, Li Qing, and Chen Haicheng. Subsequently, Ma Yinchu stood up and spoke directly, believing that it may not be possible to reject it in fact. If the central government rejects it, then we can reject it again. If the Legislative Yuan must pass it, the Legislative Yuan can be reorganized and another group of people can be replaced to pass the proposal. At this point, Speaker Sun said: "If the central government's task is rejected, it would be illegal, because it is not an elected Legislative Yuan now. If it is submitted by the Executive Yuan, it can be rejected. Now, it can only be suggested or re-examined." As a result, it was generally agreed that the council was not necessary, and that it was established without legislative procedures, "violating laws and destroying discipline," which was extremely illegal, so it was resolved to postpone the discussion.

### Two Supervisors Illegally Agreed on Changchun Railway Assets, Humiliating the Nation; Northeast Investigation Team Cables Central Government Requesting Punishment

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th] This reporter visited the person in charge of the Northeast Region Receiving Work Investigation Team on the 13th and received details on the case of Senior Supervisors Gao Lunjin and Qiu Weiying of the Changchun Railway Asset Determination Committee illegally signing a resolution that humiliated the nation. According to the report: The Organization Law of the Changchun Railway Asset Determination Committee originally stipulated that meetings would be held in Chongqing, with three members each from China and the Soviet Union. However, on January 24 of this year, Gao and Qiu held meetings with the Soviet side in Qia, totaling sixteen meetings. At the first meeting, Senior Supervisor Gao declared to the Soviet side that the government had granted him full power and recognized the meeting as formal. At the second meeting, Senior Supervisor Gao stated during the discussion that the presence of two of our members was enough of a majority, and if the opinions were consistent, the third member could not object. The fourth meeting resolved that the three main lines of Haman, Hahuan, and Hada, totaling 2,464 kilometers, and six branch lines (Dashiqiao to Yingkou, Jinzhou to Chengzitong, Dafangshen, Liushutun, Nanlingguan to Ganjingzi, Zhoushuizi to Lushun, and Zhoushuizi to Dalian), totaling 62 kilometers, together with all large and small stations and in-station lines, and applied technical houses and buildings, and station equipment, were all designated as Changchun Railway property. The fifth meeting resolved that 17 branch lines and sidings of coal mines, totaling about 400 kilometers, together with all station houses, buildings, and equipment, were all designated as Changchun Railway property. The sixth meeting resolved that forest branch lines and sidings, totaling about 800 kilometers, together with all stations, houses, buildings, and equipment, were all designated as Changchun Railway property. The seventh meeting resolved that the Shichazi lime branch line and siding, totaling about 150 kilometers, together with all station houses, buildings, and equipment, were all designated as Changchun Railway property. The eighth meeting resolved that 51 medical institutions along the line, together with all warehouses, pharmacies, laundry rooms, disinfection rooms, buildings, and equipment, were all designated as Changchun Railway property. In the remaining eight meetings, some were signed and some were passed but not yet signed. On February 27, the team received a fast mail telegram from citizens of Harbin, stating that Gao Lunjin had sold the Songhua River Railway Bridge in Songpuzhen, the Sanke Tree Locomotive Repair Factory, and land in the Shixiangfang area to the Changchun Railway at a price. The proceeds from the sale were not paid in cash by the Changchun Railway, but were used as our country's investment in the Changchun Railway. The Songpu Railway Bridge is the only way to pass for our country's La (Hai) Bin (Harbin) (Hu) Lan (Hai) Lun railways. It is recognized that Gao charges a toll of 75,000 yuan for each train passing over the bridge. Coal is charged a toll of 50 yuan per ton. With 30 trains passing through daily, the country suffers a huge loss. Moreover, the most important thing is that the Mudanjiang to Tuchengzi and Jixi to Linkou lines, as well as the Mudanjiang District line, Angangxi District line, Changchun District line, Sipingjie District line, and Liaoyang District line, a total of six places, are where our country's state-owned railways intersect with the Changchun Railway. It should not cut off our country's money-making roads by ten kilometers and allocate them to the Changchun Railway, making it impossible for our trains to reach the final destination platform. Even if a contract is signed with the Changchun Railway, a large amount of toll fees must be paid, and it cannot be exempted from various restrictions, resulting in the state-owned railway's revenue plummeting. Gao Lunjin and Qiu Weiying's duties were to investigate: which industries belonged to the Changchun Railway before 1905, and which industries were owned by the country after 1905, according to the agenda, the Organization Law of the Asset Committee stipulated that one member should be sent from China and the Soviet Union, and the meeting place for the three-person meeting was in Chongqing. There was no clause that stipulated the number of attendees over half the number. However, Gao Lunjin took advantage of his visit to Harbin to investigate materials and held a formal meeting of the Asset Committee in Harbin without notifying the Changchun Railway Board of Directors. Such acts of national humiliation, selling the country, and extreme illegality have been reported to the central government, requesting punishment.

### 30,000 Taels of Confiscated Opium to Be Publicly Burned on a Set Date

[Our Hankou Correspondent, 14th] The Xiang, E, and Gan District Investigation Team previously suggested that the authorities here burn the received opium in advance. However, the provincial authorities insisted on reporting to the Executive Yuan before it could be handled carefully. Some people also argued that one tael of opium was worth one tael of gold, and requested that it be temporarily preserved, which led to the matter being shelved for a time. It is now learned that the team has received a reply from the Executive Yuan approving the burning of the opium locally, and with the consent of the provincial government, it has been decided to publicly burn the 30,000 taels of opium next week. Moreover, the team's work has not yet been fully completed, and they are considering extending their stay in Hankou.

### Wuchang to Be Established as a City

Editorial

### Is There a Fork in the Road for American Diplomacy?

U.S. Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace gave a speech to the Political Action Committee of American Left-Wing Citizens the day before yesterday, vigorously arguing that there is a need to change the course of American foreign policy. The main points of his speech were four: (1) Britain's adoption of an imperialist policy in the Near East and the Soviet Union's adoption of a retaliatory policy are sufficient to draw the United States into war; unless the United States adopts a clear and realistic policy, it cannot avoid war. (2) The United States should observe the world political situation with its own eyes, and not with pro-British or pro-Soviet eyes; although Americans love the British, it is a mistake to take Britain as the point of the American foreign policy. (3) The United States and the Soviet Union should divide spheres of influence and not interfere with each other. It must be outside the two major spheres of influence; however, for world trade, China should open its doors.

Wallace's speech in his capacity as Secretary of Commerce is originally not worth emphasizing in the United States, where there is freedom of speech; however, Wallace, who previously served as Vice President, had the content of his speech approved by President Truman before giving it, and Truman later publicly expressed his agreement with Wallace's speech. Moreover, Wallace visited China during the War of Resistance, and he is extremely concerned about the situation in the Far East. This speech, which advocates that the United States change its foreign policy, cannot be said to be of great significance. However, are there no difficulties in practice with the new policy proposed by Wallace? Should American foreign policy pave a new path today? Let us state our views:

First, the new policy advocated by Wallace and Secretary of State James Byrnes' policy toward Germany announced in Stuttgart, Germany, not only contradict each other in spirit and substance, but also run counter to each other. Where will American foreign policy go? It has become the most serious problem. Although President Truman said that there are no contradictions between the speeches of Byrnes and Wallace, this statement is too vague, and who believes it? Therefore, people all over the world are still waiting for President Truman's reiterated statement. Internal opinions in the United States are afraid of the inevitable division of ways, and the struggle between the two foreign policy lines will intensify. Perhaps Wallace's speech has caused a great uproar in the American diplomatic community; however, the American people and Congress will choose their path.

Second, cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to jointly create world peace was originally the common and unanimous hope of the people of all countries after the war. Unfortunately, after the war, the three countries, due to conflicts of interest, tended to diverge, which created the current stalemate, so that the post-war world could return to normal as soon as possible. In early December last year, Byrnes also had great determination and personally flew to Moscow to seek a compromise between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, attempting to solve all post-war problems on the basis of trilateral coordination. At that time, when people saw the declaration issued by the three foreign ministers, who was not delighted and thought that the future of the world was full of detailed and bright prospects; however, like a flash in the pan, it soon disappeared. This piece of history is enough to prove that it is not possible to achieve three-way cooperation in one fell swoop. It is easy to share adversity, but difficult to share prosperity! The world is not yet at peace, and the relationship between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union is already like this. Can Wallace not see the reason?

Third, the conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union are not limited to land alone, and the same is true in Asia. Therefore, the United States feels particularly anxious about the China issue. According to the agreement reached at the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers, a decision was also made on the China portion. In short, the three countries do not interfere in China's internal affairs. China is among the five powers after the war, and the three powers declared that they would not interfere in China's internal affairs. In the eyes of the Chinese people, this is already close to insult! Wallace's speech this time states that it will not be included in any sphere of influence, as if this is respecting China's independence. In fact, this still fails to recognize China's position in the Far East, and the Chinese people dare not incline to accept this attitude. Especially ridiculous is that Wallace has not forgotten the "Open Door Policy," which makes us unable to help but speculate on Wallace's intentions in establishing a coalition government. This is as if on the one hand, he said he would not interfere with a friend's diet, but on the other hand, he forced him to eat bread but not rice!

Fourth, there are contradictions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, but how can there be no contradictions between Britain and the United States? How to make all countries satisfied and be able to understand each other is indeed a serious problem. In his speech, Wallace called Britain's policy in the Near East imperialist. This sentence has aroused the indignation of the British government and the public. It is expected that the discord between Britain and the United States is also beginning to appear. The world political situation is really like a mess; if everyone does not realize it, there is no way to sort it out.

### Marshal Ma Ascends Guling for the Eighth Time

The current negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have always been revolving around in circles because the CCP has adopted a "dragging" approach, and no conclusion has been reached, causing our mediators to suffer repeated setbacks. However, the mediators, with the spirit of "never give up" and indomitable, continue to work hard to mediate regardless of any hardship, attempting to break the current stalemate. Special Envoy George Marshall flew to Guling again the day before yesterday. This is Marshal Ma's eighth ascent of Guling! This spirit of knowing that it cannot be done and still doing it makes us both admire and ashamed.

It is said that Marshal Ma's purpose of flying to Guling this time is to convey the central government's proposal to reopen the military three-person meeting, but another saying is that Marshal Ma has rejected this proposal. According to the CCP spokesperson, the CCP believes that the five-person group meeting has failed to obtain sufficient guarantees and is afraid that it will be difficult to achieve peace, so it refuses to participate and wants to go back to the old way and advocates reopening the military three-person meeting. However, no one dares to assert whether the CCP's claim has the slightest sincerity. Because in the eyes of our common people, if reopening the military three-person meeting can break the current stalemate, then quickly convening the five-person group meeting will also be able to achieve peace. Moreover, the military three-person group had no way to do anything before, the ceasefire agreement was signed but was ineffective, and the central government repeatedly issued ceasefire orders, which the Communist Party repeatedly violated, so what is the use of reopening the military three-person group? The CCP is simply playing tricks, and besides the fact that he is deliberately creating complications, there is really no other legitimate reason to be found. Therefore, Special Envoy Marshall was also very indifferent to this, but in order to do everything possible and to pick up his wife, it is also okay to fly to Guling again for a final effort. We really have nothing to say about Marshal Ma's ascent to Guling in the scorching heat and thin clouds, but who wants him to do this? Even if the CCP intends to "oppose the United States," there should be a limit to deceiving people!

Now, the crux of the stalled negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is obviously entirely on the Communist Party's side. They talk about peace in words and say "unconditional peace" all the time, but in practice, the domestic wars are all caused by the Communist Party, and military and political conditions emerge one after another. At the beginning of the enemy's return to surrender, it and the government "contended for surrender"; when the "contention for surrender" came to an end, it relied on its military force and expanded its territory everywhere, but it did not dare to openly claim to be the head of the military. Instead, it hid behind the smoke screen of negotiations and engaged in conspiracies to sabotage transportation. Until today, the hideous face of the Communist Party has been gradually exposed, and its ultimate goal is nothing more than to dismember the country and turn a unified and peaceful China into a divided and warring China! Recently, the CCP has claimed that it will convene a people's representative conference in the "liberated areas" and then organize its "central government," which is both a threat and another explanation of the CCP's ambition. Recently, a reporter from the Chicago Sun Times discussed the current situation in China in detail, saying that "the CCP is obstructing peace and has long lost the sympathy of the people." It is a truly insightful statement.

The Chinese people are too weak and too pitiful! China has already been like this, hostile to the country, and our common people, just like mediator Marshal Ma, are still begging the Communist Party to wake up and "lay down the butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot." In fact, what hope is there? "Those who act unjustly will destroy themselves!" The CCP may have such a day in the future.

### The Smooth Progress of the Investigation is Uncertain; Many Complex Problems Exist; The Amount of Corruption Accepted by Two Bureau Chiefs in Taiwan Province is Staggering

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 14th] Fan Zisui, Wu Cangzhou, and Du Guangxun, the persons in charge of the investigation team in Nanjing, stated that the received lists submitted by various agencies were mostly self-revised. They were unable to read the original lists, leaving them feeling at a loss.

[Our Dispatch from Taipei on the 14th] The investigation team has reported the cases of Ren Weijun, the director of the Taiwan Monopoly Bureau, and Yu Baixi, the director of the Trade Bureau. It is reported that the director of the Monopoly Bureau embezzled 30,000 Taiwan dollars, including 50,000 tons of salt, 84 kilograms of opium, and 2.5 tons of camphor. The Trade Bureau failed to report 22 kinds of received materials, one of which amounted to 3 million. Currently, the deputy directors of the two bureaus are acting on their behalf. Public opinion believes that Chief Chen's insistence on the specialization of special institutions and policies in Taiwan Province has been struck a blow due to unsound personnel arrangements.

[Central News Agency Special Dispatch] Yang Gaogong, the supervisory commissioner of Fujian and Taiwan, and also the head of the first organization of the investigation team in the Fujian-Taiwan region, arrived in Shanghai by plane from Xiamen on the 14th. According to Yang's statement to reporters regarding the receiving work of the investigation team in Fujian Province, there are more than ten receiving agencies in Xiamen and Kinmen, and the investigation has been largely completed. A total of forty-one secret reports from the public regarding receiving incidents have been received. Several cases have been verified, such as the Xiamen Municipal Government's receipt of 1,731 bolts of enemy and puppet woolen fabrics. The results of the investigation revealed that 92 bolts were missing. The missing items are worth approximately tens of millions of dollars. In addition, a certain Mr. Yang, the former director of the Xiamen Municipal Finance Bureau, was found to have received enemy and puppet materials without authorization, and an investigation revealed that many pieces of furniture and goods were missing. Both of the above cases will be transferred to the court for handling. There are also several cases of extortion and malfeasance by receiving personnel, which are serious and complex, and are still under investigation and have not been publicly announced yet.

### Formerly a Prosperous Area; Today Overgrown with Weeds

Most Houses in Nanchang are Destroyed

[Our Dispatch from Nanchang on the 13th] Our reporter inspected the disaster area in Nanchang on the 12th. The northern part of the city, such as Xiaogong Temple and Linggong Temple, used to be a prosperous residential area, but now they are completely destroyed and overgrown with weeds. Before the war, Nanchang had more than 40,000 houses, but only more than 10,000 remained after its liberation last autumn. The destruction rate is approximately 73% or more. The population is now increasing. According to an investigation in August, it has reached 200,000, an increase of about nine-tenths compared to the time of liberation, which has caused a serious housing shortage. Poor citizens are living in tents organized by the Rehabilitation and Relief Administration.

### Rampant Banditry in the Suburbs of Jintan; Security Team's Guns Robbed; Frequent Robberies on Land and Water in Changshu

[Our Dispatch from Jintan] Jiangzhuangpu in Baitazhen, five kilometers from the city, was attacked by more than fifty bandits late at night on the 7th.

### Zhejiang Provincial Assembly Postpones Closing; Requests Acceptance of Chen Bijun's Assets in Longyou; Discusses Countermeasures for Reducing Land Taxes Again

[Our Dispatch from Hangzhou on the 14th] The Zhejiang Provincial Assembly has decided to postpone its closing to the 20th. It also passed a resolution to increase the number of resident committee members to twelve. At the meeting, Senator Yu Shaosong questioned Zhong Pusheng, the director of the Hangzhou Office of the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, asking him to expedite the acceptance of Chen Ni's Shanzun's Shiliting estate in Longyou. The property was purchased at a low price when Wang Ni was the Premier of the Executive Yuan, and it has not been accepted to this day.

[Our Dispatch from Hangzhou on the 14th] The Zhejiang Provincial Assembly sent three representatives to Beijing to petition the central government to reduce the land tax. A telegram has now been received stating that the Ministry of Food has agreed to reduce it from 5.67% to 5.5%, but the Provincial Assembly is still not satisfied and has decided to urge the representatives to return to Hangzhou to hold a secret meeting on the 16th to discuss countermeasures.

[Our Dispatch from Hangzhou on the 14th] In today's Provincial Assembly meeting, senators strongly criticized the Zhejiang Local Bank, accusing it of implementing disguised gold loans, fostering bureaucratic capital, and the general manager using public assets for his own benefit. General Manager Yan had no counter-evidence for the above matters, and he had no specific figures for profits and loans. Therefore, most senators expressed dissatisfaction and ridicule. Some senators also believe that the establishment of administrative inspectors and security commanders in each district is no longer necessary because the war has ended and transportation has been restored. They requested the central government to abolish them in order to facilitate government administration and save expenses. The assembly has handed it over to the review committee for review.

The rolling stock equipment is also incomplete. In particular, there is a severe shortage of passenger cars and locomotives. As for the Wuhan Bridge, the Hubei Provincial Government had previously established a construction committee, and Mao, the deputy head of this group, went to participate in the discussion of the traffic policy. This time, he accompanied American engineers Dihmer and Bowman to re-survey the site and determined that the bridge needs to be actively constructed. The bridge is planned to be built in two sections: (1) from Wuzhi Yellow Crane Tower to Hanyang Dongshan (connecting the Yangtze River); (2) from Hanyang to Hankou (connecting the Han River). The total length of the bridge is approximately 11,000 meters, and the estimated cost is approximately 150 billion yuan.

### The Earth's Landmass is Generally Increasing; Seawater Levels are Lowering, and Temperatures are Getting Colder; Conversation with Dr. Ma Tingying, Chinese Oceanographer

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 14th] Dr. Ma Tingying, a Chinese oceanographer, recently discovered that the landmass on the Earth's surface is generally increasing, while seawater levels are gradually lowering, and seawater temperatures are also gradually getting colder. He is currently the director of the Taiwan Ocean Research Institute and a professor at National Taiwan University. Recently, he went to Penghu, Huoyushao Island, and Suao to collect approximately ten tons of coral and ship-eating mollusk specimens from the oceans in eastern Taiwan Province. He said that the temperature in the deep waters around Penghu has dropped from 13 degrees to about 10 degrees. Many of the corals and pearls around Penghu have been frozen to death. Fish are suffering from colds and typhoid fever due to the cold, and mucus flows from their gills, causing them to become stiff and float on the surface of the sea. Every winter, the fish in the Dongsha Islands float on the surface of the sea, forming a thick layer. Because of the abundance of food, water birds often walk peacefully on the sea to peck at the eyeballs of the fish, resulting in a "fish cannon festival" in the waters of the Dongsha Islands for several months each year. Mr. Ma said that the ocean research in the western Pacific Ocean should be undertaken by us in the future. He believes that Taiwan is surrounded by the sea and is located in a warm and cold exchange zone. The aquatic fish brought by the Kuroshio Current are extremely abundant, and there is still great hope in the next hundred years. He also said that the eastern boundary of Taiwan is the Pacific Ocean, which is more than 2,000 feet deep, while the west is the Taiwan Strait, which is a shallow sea with a depth of only 100 to 200 feet. Therefore, there are many ocean-related problems, which have been regarded as an excellent "battlefield" by the general oceanographic community. He believes that China's research on the ocean is still very backward, and there is currently a lack of talent. After the various specimens collected by Mr. Ma this time are sorted out, they will be classified, printed, and distributed to universities, the fishing industry, and naval authorities for reference. It is also heard that after conducting research around Taiwan, he will depart from the Fujian Sea and collect marine specimens from the North and South Seas to continue conducting field research. He said: If my work is completed, even the Tibet and Xinjiang regions of China can display a set of marine specimens.

### Torpedo Boats Converted into Passenger Ships; Will Sail to Taiwan, Shanghai, and Other Places

### Byrnes in Paris Seemed Struck by Lightning; Wallace's Speech Caused a Great Disturbance; Vandenberg States the Basic Principles of American Policy

[News Report] San Francisco, 14th Broadcast: Byrnes, Connolly, and Vandenberg, after hearing Wallace's speech in Paris and President Truman's approval of the speech, were "thunderstruck." They believed that after this incident, all the efforts made by the American representatives in Paris against the Soviet Union for the past seven weeks had been in vain. All three, Byrnes, Connolly, and Vandenberg will issue statements. Today, they talked several times with Washington from Paris. Byrnes did not know in advance that President Truman had approved this diplomatic policy speech. When he heard about this, he stood silent for a long time. The American representatives did not deny that President Truman had made a big mistake. One representative said, "The Soviets must be rejoicing tonight."

[News Report] Paris, 14th Broadcast: American Senator Vandenberg expressed his views on Wallace's speech. This is considered a response to Wallace. Vandenberg said: American foreign policy relies entirely on the unity of the United States for support, and Paris is now expressing doubts about this unity. Vandenberg said: For the past eighteen months, the two tendencies of policy divergence have been supported by the common ideas of wartime. Most members of the Republican and Democratic parties were able to unite into a unified American front and face the world. This is the only way to find peace and form collective security. Those who abandon this path will harm the goals we have already announced. I am sure that most Republicans will still be happy to seek unity with the government and stand on the basic principles of the United States to implement our foreign policy, without taking the dictatorship of any party, without being hostile or surrendering to other countries, and safeguarding human rights and basic freedoms. However, for so-called unity, we must also seek it within the government agencies themselves. Vandenberg also said: We can only cooperate with one Secretary of State at a time. The political views expressed by Wallace seem to be very different from those followed by Secretary of State Byrnes in Paris.

[News Report] San Francisco, 14th Broadcast: Acting Secretary of State Clayton stated at a press conference yesterday that part of Commerce Secretary Wallace's speech was far from the American foreign policy announced by Secretary of State Byrnes. Clayton said that Byrnes's recent statement is still sufficient to represent American policy. When answering questions, Clayton said that he had not received orders to change American foreign policy to match Wallace's speech. Some sources say that the intention of Wallace's speech is that he favors dividing the world into spheres of influence of great powers and abandoning the United States' efforts to restore the Potsdam promise to the people of Eastern Europe. Byrnes opposed this kind of sphere of influence in a speech this spring. Congress has had different reactions to Wallace's speech. At the same time, non-official observers also believe that Wallace's speech conflicts with the American foreign policy elucidated by Byrnes.

Two Factions Advocate Going Their Separate Ways

[United Press, Washington, 13th] From the current internal situation, two trends are becoming increasingly obvious: (1) Truman now has two foreign policies in his hands that are diverging. One is advocated by the Secretary of Commerce (the only remaining member of the late President Roosevelt's cabinet), and the other is promoted by the Secretary of State. Truman's position can strongly support both foreign policies. (2) Senior officials do not actually want Wallace to change the United States' policy toward the Soviet Union, but it remains to be seen where to go and what to do. Truman needs to make another public statement before the situation can be completely clarified.

Wallace and Byrnes have remained silent about this storm, but several leaders of the Democratic and Republican parties have severely criticized Wallace's speech and the situation it has caused. According to Republican Senator Taft, the president's approval of Wallace's speech is "selling out his Secretary of State." Democratic Congressman Ross wired Truman, saying that approving Wallace's speech is "removing Byrnes's bottom plate and alarming the United States."

Following an Independent Diplomatic Path

Diplomatic circles analyzed the original text of Wallace's speech and found three points that were inconsistent with the current American foreign policy outline: (1) Although Byrnes has repeatedly solemnly denied the existence of a British-American anti-Soviet group, London and Washington have completely parallel policies in dealing with political problems in the Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean. The most important decision made by both parties is to oppose the Soviet Union's military expansion in the Turkish Straits. Wallace's intention is to split the American foreign policy from the British imperialist policy because of this parallel diplomatic action. Wallace did not explain, but diplomatic observers believe that this is the only possibility. (2) For several months, the basic attitude of the United States on all major issues concerning the Soviet Union is that the United States will never compromise on any issues involving American principles and interests. Wallace's statement that being tough on the Soviet Union is of no use probably refers to this. (3) American policy is based on opposing the division of the world into spheres of influence, while Wallace advocates that the United States should not interfere in Eastern European politics. The Soviet Union does not ask about Latin America and Western Europe.

As for President Truman's statement that Byrnes's policy has not changed, he has substantially revised his attitude in favor of Wallace's speech, because the president will fully support Byrnes's foreign policy. There is currently no indication that the president's support of Wallace's speech represents a major change in the United States' relationship with Britain or the Soviet Union. Generally, the president wants to make people believe that under his and Byrnes's leadership, the United States is following a completely independent foreign policy, neither pro-Soviet nor anti-Soviet.

### Wallace's Speech Has Ulterior Motives

[French News Agency, Washington, 13th] Diplomatic sources say that Wallace's speech had ulterior motives. His purpose was to win the hearts of voters so that he could play an important role on the political stage after the 1948 presidential election, but his friendly attitude towards the Soviet Union has been repeatedly attacked. Wallace's speech is sufficient to be called an outline of a completely new policy, acknowledging that today's world is divided into two major spheres of influence, and China is still outside these two major spheres of influence, but only open to worldwide commercial competition. In addition, some government officials believe that because some conflicts of interest between Britain and the Soviet Union are unavoidable, it is extremely difficult to draw a clear line of demarcation between the spheres of influence of the United States and the Soviet Union so that they do not interfere with each other.

### Security Council Postponed

### The Antagonism Between the Two Blocs Becomes More Obvious; Many Disputes at the Paris Peace Conference; The Head of the British Delegation, Alexander, Returns Home

[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th] The head of the British delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander, flew back here from Paris this morning. Lord Alexander denied reports that he had stormed out of the military committee meeting of the peace conference, claiming: "I did not slam the door and leave; I was merely leaving the meeting place to prepare for my departure from Paris."

[United Press, Paris, 13th] Heated arguments occurred in two committees of the peace conference, leading to the British representative storming out of the meeting, and another Soviet chairman quietly leaving the meeting amid a public uproar, resulting in a motion of no confidence being proposed. Earlier, in the military committee, the British representative, Alexander, vehemently argued with the Soviet representative, Slavine, regarding Albania's right to express its opinion on the military clauses of the Italian peace treaty, and then stormed out of the meeting. In the political committee of the peace conference, the chairman of the Byelorussian SSR, Kiselev, refused to express a decision on a British proposal and declared an adjournment, causing an uproar in the meeting place. The U.S. representative, Caffery, objected to the chairman's declaration of adjournment, but Chairman Kiselev quietly left the meeting. Afterwards, eight out of the thirteen committee members unusually passed a motion of no confidence in Kiselev, declaring his adjournment improper. The dispute arose because of a Greek amendment requesting the correction of the Greek-Albanian border under conditions favorable to Greece. The Soviet representative objected, arguing that the amendment was submitted after the August 20th deadline and should not be discussed in the committee. The British representative, Warner, proposed putting to a vote whether the Greek amendment should be discussed in the committee or the peace conference, at which point Chairman Kiselev suddenly declared an adjournment.

LaGuardia replied: The Northeast relief plan was jointly determined with China. If changes are requested, they should be initiated by the Chinese side.

### The "Thirteen" Club

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 14th] Americans often avoid the number thirteen, considering it unlucky. Some people with a penchant for mischief want to mock this superstitious idea, so they have organized the "Thirteen Club" to promote the number thirteen. The club met on the thirteenth day on 13th Street in New York. Members walked up thirteen steps, thirteen people sat at one table, and used the same match to light cigarettes thirteen times. The chairman of the club gave a speech on the issue of superstition. The grand finale was a spectacular performance: smashing a mirror. As of today, no untoward incidents have been reported.

### The City Council: Reports from Various Bureaus Completed; Dissatisfaction with the Current State of Education Leads to Intense Questioning; The Mayor's Proposal to Extend Daylight Saving Time Is Rejected; A Full Review Meeting Will Be Held Today

[Our Own Dispatch] The administrative reports from the city government's various bureaus were all completed at yesterday's city council meeting. The ninth meeting yesterday morning was a report from the Deputy Director of the Education Bureau, Li Ximou, and the afternoon session was a report from the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian. The councilors questioned the Education Bureau Director, with the issue of excessive tuition increases being the most notable. Councilors questioned the Social Affairs Bureau on labor issues, such as providing relief to unemployed workers and organizing labor welfare programs. The two directors answered these questions. The verbal questioning of the Social Affairs Bureau may continue at the next general meeting.

During yesterday's meeting, the following were discussed and resolved: the election of five representatives to participate in the inspection team, the decision on five members of the drafting committee for the City Council Declaration, and changes to the agenda. In addition, the Mayor's proposal to extend daylight saving time to the end of October to alleviate the electricity crisis was not passed by the meeting.

The City Council's agenda was slightly changed by the general meeting yesterday due to the temporary decision to invite representatives from the Executive Yuan's agencies to attend and report. This morning there will be a full budget review meeting, and the ninth group will independently review the budget in the afternoon. Tomorrow morning at the eleventh meeting, in addition to discussing proposals, the Committee for the Allocation of Housing to Shanghai Agencies under the Executive Yuan will be invited to attend and report on the allocation of housing. The twelfth meeting on the morning of the 16th will be changed to the third review meeting, and the meeting on the morning of the 17th will be changed to the twelfth meeting, with a report from the Shanghai Branch of the Executive Headquarters of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA).

### Li Ximou Reports on Education: Expresses Hope that Municipal Schools Can Avoid Becoming Bureaucratic Organizations

The Deputy Director of the Education Bureau, Li Ximou, gave a report at the ninth meeting of the council, stating: The focus of this year's work is: 1. To promote national education and establish more municipal schools. 2. To prepare for the establishment of secondary education districts and promote vocational education. 3. To expand social education and strengthen the mass literacy movement. 4. To implement district supervision and strict enforcement. 5. To establish science and labor centers to concentrate training in order to supplement the insufficient funding of various schools.

The biggest difficulty at present is the lack of school buildings. If the ten districts raise funds to establish schools, it would be a good example to follow. Furthermore, the allocation of municipal schools is not balanced, and there are significant differences in the number of municipal schools in each district. The general shortcomings of schools in the city are the lack of library books and equipment, insufficient cleanliness, hygiene, and health education, and the lack of domestic science training in girls' schools. The Education Bureau hopes that municipal schools can avoid becoming institutionalized and bureaucratic and that there should not be too many staff members. Secondly, it is hoped that school authorities can cooperate with students' parents to form parent committees to solve various difficulties.

Supplementary Report: Regarding private school fees, we have considered them for a long time, and the Ministry of Education also has orders, hoping to be lenient with the fees of various schools. Therefore, the Education Bureau does not restrict the fees of private schools but stipulates that there should be a 20% quota for free students. As for the fees charged by municipal schools, they are used to expand the number of classes.

Regarding the Education Fund, Mayor Qian promised 1 billion yuan, but as of the end of May this year, only 500 million yuan has been received. It has not yet been withdrawn from the Central Bank.

The total amount originally set for the Respect Teachers Movement was 1 billion yuan, and the current amount received is over 88.7 million yuan. This has been audited and verified by the Lixin Accounting Firm. The donation for respecting teachers has received enthusiastic assistance from all sectors of society, with the textile industry providing even more help. Payment items include: 49.419 million yuan paid to municipal school teachers, 20.619 million yuan paid to private school teachers, and an additional 20 million yuan subsidized by the city government, for a total expenditure of 81.7414 million yuan. Because the universities raised 4.965 million yuan, which they will manage themselves, there is still 6.9203 million yuan remaining, which is planned to be distributed to private school teachers or incorporated into the Education Fund.

### Hotel Employees Petition the Council

[Our Own Dispatch] At yesterday afternoon's meeting, while the Social Affairs Bureau was giving its administrative report, over a hundred hotel employees marched to the meeting to petition and distributed petition letters, stating that the hotel owners were intending to overturn the salary system and restore the small account malpractices, and requested that this be stopped. The council allowed the union representatives to go upstairs to listen to the meeting. Later, during his report, Director Wu specifically mentioned the hotels' request to abolish price controls and restore small accounts and made it clear that the government had refused to restore the small account system.

### The Selection of Members of the Drafting Committee for the City Council's Closing Declaration Is Decided

The City Council passed a resolution yesterday to issue a declaration to the citizens of the city before the closing ceremony scheduled for the afternoon of the 21st of this month. Speaker Pan proposed the election of a drafting committee, and the meeting decided to elect five members. Speaker Pan nominated and voted on five people: Zhan Wenhuzi, Luo Qinghua, Zhu Xuefan, Zhuang Horen, and Yan Xiangcheng. Later, Zhu Xuefan declined, and Tao Baichuan was nominated to replace him, which was passed by the meeting.

### Private School Fees Are Too High, Parents Cannot Afford Them; Furthermore, There Are Corrupt Practices of "Examination Escort Teams" Helping Students Cheat; Councilors Question Extensively

After the Deputy Director of the Education Bureau, Li Ximou, completed his administrative report, the questioning began. The councilors criticized the lack of restrictions on private school fees in the city, and the accusations were quite severe. Jiang Huaisu fired the first shot, calling it a painful statement, not a fatigue bombing. Although the Ministry of Education ordered the fees of various schools to be relaxed, it did not mean they should be left unregulated, but the Education Bureau, after detailed consideration, did not impose any restrictions, so that parents cannot afford them. Before the war, elementary school tuition was 4 to 14 yuan, and even if multiplied by 5,000, it would only be 20,000 to 70,000 yuan. Currently, elementary schools charge 60,000 to 120,000 yuan, which far exceeds the pre-war standard. How can this be considered fair and reasonable? Deputy Director Li replied: The Education Bureau is also dissatisfied with the current tuition fees of various private schools, but the Education Bureau and the mayor have spoken with the authorities of various private schools, and the situation is very difficult, and there is a lack of a method that can satisfy everyone. Although the Education Bureau does not restrict the fees of private schools, it stipulates that each school must have a 20% quota for free students to accommodate poor children. At this time, Lu Yinchu stood up and said: Tuition fees should be restricted, and several councilors applauded. More councilors criticized the Education Bureau for being irresponsible and firmly demanded that school fees be restricted.

Deputy Director Li repeatedly replied: The decision has already been made not to restrict tuition fees at present. Changing it would be difficult and hard to implement. If the council decides that school fees should be restricted, the Education Bureau will follow suit in the future. Mayor Wu, seeing that the councilors were paying close attention to the issue of tuition fees, explained the matter, saying: There are currently two problems: 1. Schools cannot fully accommodate school-age children. 2. School fees are too high. These two points seem unrelated, but in fact, they are closely related. Various private schools have held joint meetings and made decisions on fees, and the Ministry of Education has also given instructions. If the Education Bureau strictly restricts fees, private schools may not be able to operate, making it even more difficult for school-age children. The city government has convened a meeting of principals and strictly ordered that elementary schools must have a 20% free quota and secondary schools must have a 15% free quota. School funds are deposited in banks, and interest is calculated together. After the school opens, it will report the entire budget to the Education Bureau, which will send supervisors to strictly check whether the income and expenditure are in compliance, whether the treatment is excessive, whether the expenses are transparent, and whether school funds have been misappropriated privately. At the same time, it is hoped that the council will pay special attention when reviewing education funds and see if they can be increased. However, according to Wang Weizhe, who told reporters that the Education Bureau's allocation of funds is not clearly defined, making it difficult to review the budget.

Regarding other questions to the Education Bureau, Deputy Director Li briefly answered as follows due to time constraints: Rural supplementary schools are being actively prepared. Regarding the abolition of entrance examinations, in the future, graduates of municipal schools may not have to participate in entrance examinations and can directly enter school, but internal school examinations must be strictly conducted. There are "examination escort teams" in various schools who help students cheat. We hope that schools will automatically correct this. We plan to ask party groups to assist in organizing the literacy movement committee. Private schools can be changed to municipal schools after investigation. To rectify the school spirit, district supervision will be adopted. To rectify the teaching staff, teacher assessments will be conducted, and short-term teacher training will be implemented.

### Social Affairs Bureau's Administrative Report: Resolving Labor-Management Disputes Proceeds Smoothly

When the speaker announced that Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau would give his report, the councilors gave him enthusiastic applause. After Director Wu took the stage, he first reported on food administration, saying that food prices soared in May of this year. The bureau took emergency measures to register grain reserves, strictly prohibit the manipulation of illegal rice merchants, and with the assistance of the Ministry of Food, transported rice from Sichuan and Jiangxi to Shanghai, thus averting the crisis. This year's harvest has been plentiful in various places, and new rice has already entered the market. In order to stabilize food prices, the government is maintaining a level of 40,000 yuan per stone. The Food Section of the bureau only manages administration, and it does not handle rice, grain, or funds. Mediation of labor-management disputes is one of the bureau's heavy tasks. At the end of last year, strikes and work slowdowns occurred frequently. The bureau mediated labor-management disputes in accordance with the four principles of the Ministry of Social Affairs: (1) protect the legitimate interests of workers, (2) rectify labor discipline, (3) all negotiations should follow legal procedures, and (4) do not change the base salary or the methods and opinions put forward by the municipal government and the municipal chamber of commerce. The highest peak of labor unrest in the city was in March of this year, with 54 strikes and work slowdowns throughout the month. By the time statistics were compiled in August, none had occurred. The reasons for the elimination of labor unrest are nothing more than (1) the effectiveness of the union leaders, (2) the workers' understanding of the current crisis in industry and commerce, and not making excessive demands, and (3) the government's determination to eliminate labor unrest and stabilize the industrial sector. The district union system at that time was the root of labor unrest. Now, with the assistance of the industrial sector, the bureau is smoothly promoting the reform of the district union system into a factory union system. The Labor-Management Arbitration Committee's resolution of the knitting industry in districts 1, 2, and 3 to reduce wages and pay according to 85% of the cost of living index was a major achievement. Director Wu also reported that the budget for welfare and charitable undertakings was originally 800 million yuan, but so far, the actual amount received is only 80 million yuan. In view of the city government's financial difficulties, the Social Affairs Bureau requested the Executive Yuan to allocate a special fund of 900 million yuan, which was approved, but it was allocated by the Executive Headquarters of UNRRA, and because the Executive Headquarters of UNRRA had no funds, no money has been received to date. The lack of funds and housing is one of the reasons why welfare and charitable undertakings cannot be further expanded. Finally, Wu gave a supplementary report on the large number of private banks applying to resume business and the two principles of the Ministry of Finance. The price controls for the hotel and theater industries have been abolished, but hotels are absolutely not allowed to restore small accounts. In the future, the allocation of household sugar will be managed by the Civil Affairs Department.

### Anecdotes from the Meeting

The council meeting has been going on for six days, with daily trips to and from Yiyuan [a nearby garden]. Not only are newspaper reporters yawning at the meeting, but even the councilors are feeling exhausted. The councilors enter and leave the meeting, each carrying several bags of paper, like students going to school. The councilors themselves also say: "We're going to class!"

Yesterday, after Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau answered verbal inquiries, because there was not enough time for further inquiries, it was proposed to use written questions in the future, but some people still wanted to ask verbally again. Qu Yue expressed his disagreement, saying: "During verbal inquiries, the questioning will go all over the place, like a tram without rails."

Yesterday afternoon, the gallery on the second floor of the council meeting created the liveliest scene since the meeting began. It turned out that hotel employees had come to the meeting to petition, and because what the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau reported and the points questioned by the councilors were closely related to them, they listened with great interest and looked very nervous until they left the meeting at the end.

The Bureau of Public Works will host a visit to the beach embankment project in Pudong for councilors at 8:00 a.m. today, but the agenda for this morning has already been decided to convene a full budget review meeting. The speaker is afraid that all the councilors will run away, and there will be too few people at the meeting, so he specifically reminded everyone.

When electing the representatives to participate in the inspection team, Chu Shiyung [presumably Water, not Chu] voluntarily withdrew because he had served as the recipient of the postal workers' union. Lu Yinchu was a little uneasy and asked if anyone could prove it, otherwise it must be "laziness"!

Jiang Huaisu spoke up for a college student, asking the Deputy Director of the Education Bureau: A college student joined the air force to save the country, so he didn't have time to complete the school leaving procedures, and now he wants to return to school but is not allowed. "Which is more important, saving the country or completing school leaving procedures?"

When Zhu Xuefan questioned the Social Affairs Bureau, there was applause to accompany him on and off the stage. The level of support he received was rare in recent days.

Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau has another talent in answering questions, often asking the council for help, which is moving to hear.

The only female councilor who took the stage to speak yesterday was Tang Guifen, who questioned the Social Affairs Bureau on three points, all of which were women's issues, and she was particularly concerned about the welfare of female workers, showing that she is a representative of working women.

### Participation in the Investigation Team: Zhao Junhao and Five Others Elected as Representatives

Yesterday morning, the council elected five representatives to participate in the investigation team. The results were Wang Xianqing (91 votes), Zhao Junhao (87 votes), He Yuanming (86 votes), Shui Xiangyun (52 votes), and Wang Jian'e (45 votes) being elected. However, Wang Xianqing, having participated in the takeover of the municipal chamber of commerce, and Shui Xiangyun, having participated in the takeover of the postal workers' union, voluntarily requested to withdraw. They were replaced by the next highest vote-getters, Zhu Xuefan (38 votes) and Ma Junshuo (36 votes). Zhan Wenhuan proposed that the assembly pay a certain amount of travel expenses to each representative, and it was resolved that the speaker and deputy speaker should determine the amount. Feng Youzhen proposed that the assembly publicly announce to the citizens' council that it had elected councilors to participate in the investigation team, solicit the opinions of citizens on the receiving agencies, and assist in reporting corrupt practices in the takeover, with confidential letters to be sent directly to the council. The resolution was passed. Finally, Speaker Pan reiterated that the work of the investigation team would be based on a collegial system, and that all cases would be handled by the head of the investigation team, all committee members, and representatives of the council through joint deliberation.

According to He Yuanming, one of the representatives, in an interview with a reporter: The investigation work is extremely difficult and will require a considerable amount of time. The catalog of receiving agencies alone fills several boxes. However, the representatives all hope to achieve two things: "Conduct a fair investigation and live up to public expectations." After receiving a response from the investigation team, the five councilors will hold a small group meeting to discuss a plan of action, and if necessary, will request the investigation team to extend the time allotted for a thorough investigation.

### Eliminating Unhealthy Publications and Vagrants to be Implemented Gradually: Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian, Responds to Inquiries

After Director Wu finished his report, the chairman announced a ten-minute recess, followed by various councilors raising oral inquiries. First, Councilor Zhao Yangxiong spoke, asking how the Social Affairs Bureau could thoroughly eliminate unhealthy children's reading materials on the streets. Councilor Zhang Zhusan then inquired about three issues: why the labor welfare fund was not being implemented according to law, how to provide education for the children of laborers, and whether the Labor Hospital in West Shanghai should be taken over by the government. Councilor Zhu Xuefan raised three points based on newspaper reports: (1) Factories falsely accuse laborers, and union personnel are arrested; the council should effectively protect unions in the future and no longer arbitrarily detain people. (2) After a union is formally established, the appointed instructors should be immediately withdrawn and should no longer be renamed as advisors to continue their existence. (3) How should unemployed workers be relieved, especially unemployed workers coming from the rear; efforts should be made quickly to find relief methods. Next, the only female councilor who spoke yesterday, Tang Guifen, raised three issues related to women: (1) After the prohibition of prostitution, prostitutes should be given a way out. (2) The Jiliang Institute should be established as soon as possible. (3) Female workers who miscarry receive only half of their wages during the maternity leave period, which is extremely unreasonable and should be revised. After Councilor Ke finished his inquiries, Speaker Pan announced a temporary suspension of inquiries and asked Director Wu to respond first.

Director Wu answered in order: The Social Affairs Bureau's responsible department is in charge of examining unhealthy reading materials in bookstores, but there are also cases of private publications that violate the examination regulations. The bureau has worked with the police局 to strictly ban lewd and obscene picture books, and the ban on square yellow publications is also strict. Warnings have been issued separately to the publishers. The capacity of refugee and children's shelters has already been saturated. Although the Social Affairs Bureau intends to eliminate vagrants throughout the city, it is limited by certain facts, resulting in a situation where the will is there, but the strength is lacking. In the future, after financial and material resources are sufficient, it will be implemented gradually. The reason why welfare has not been universally implemented is that the business community is too depressed. If the situation improves, the welfare ordinance will be implemented. The Labor Hospital has a history of more than ten years and has a board of directors. It is not convenient for the government to take it over arbitrarily. If it is not managed well, the government can supervise it to improve. As for factories falsely accusing workers, if illegal situations are encountered, they can be resolved through judicial channels in the court. The Social Affairs Bureau should be responsible for the union and union officials and will definitely guarantee their protection. Relieving unemployed workers is something that should be done, but the relief of unemployed workers coming to Shanghai from the rear is beyond the ability of the local government and should be the responsibility of the central government. Currently, the repaired Gongda Yarn Factory, which was bombed, is being used to house unemployed workers from the rear, with food provided by the Executive Yuan Relief Administration. After a union is established, instructors should indeed be withdrawn. If there are still unwithdrawn instructors, the bureau can be notified for investigation. In response to Ms. Tang's inquiries, Director Wu said: The Caohejing shelter has also taken in some prostitutes, but management is extremely difficult. The Jiliang Institute should be established as soon as possible and experts should be hired to preside over it. Opinions on wages during the miscarriage period of female workers can be sent to the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Social Affairs for use as information when revising the Labor Law. After Director Wu finished his answers, Speaker Pan temporarily suspended inquiries because there were other important cases to discuss. However, Councilor Fan Xichang further asked whether instructors must be filled by Social Affairs Bureau staff. Director Wu replied: There are more than 300 unions in the city, and the staff of the Social Affairs Bureau cannot be allocated, so they can also be hired from other places. Anyone who has experience in popular movements can be appointed. At this point, inquiries were stopped, and proposals were discussed.

### Wu Xin is Actually Enemy Agent Zhang Xiaolong; Li Lihua's Confrontation May Be Cancelled

It is rumored that the Military Law Office of the Garrison Command is handling the case of Wu Xin, suspected of being an economic traitor, and because it involves Hua Ying actress Li Lihua, a summons was issued on the 13th, ordering Li Lihua to appear in court on the 14th for questioning. It is reported that Wu Xin is the alias of Zhang Xiaolong, a well-known enemy agent in Shanghai. During his time in the puppet regime, Zhang engaged in extortion and committed all kinds of evils. After the victory, he hid in Nanjing in an attempt to escape punishment, but was arrested by the Logistics Headquarters in Nanjing and interrogated by the Military Law Office of the headquarters. According to Zhang, he rescued many patriotic people in Shanghai, including Li Lihua, who was arrested by the enemy's gendarmerie. Therefore, the Logistics Headquarters telegraphed the municipal Garrison Command, requesting that Li Lihua be summoned for confrontation. Because Li has left Shanghai, the Garrison Command stated that the matter is not important and it is hoped that it will be cancelled. It is untrue that Wu Xin is being tried by the Garrison Command.

### Shanghai Women's New Life Movement Promotion Association Holds Fourth General Meeting Yesterday

The Shanghai Women's New Life Movement Promotion Association held its fourth general meeting yesterday. Those present included Mayor Wu's wife, Huang Zhuoqun, Committee Member Qian Jianqiu, Zhang Wenxiang, Lu Lihua, and about 60 other women from various fields. The association was founded in 1938 by Madame Yu Hongjun and has a history of nine years. Its purpose is to promote the New Life Movement. During the August 13th Incident, it organized rescue teams to serve the wounded soldiers and promoted relief and education work. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Qian Jianqiu and others convened the members to restore the association's affairs. A members' meeting was held in December last year to discuss work, and voluntary schools were set up to assist poor and sick women.

They encouraged the members to continue to move forward with the spirit of service. Finally, the entire group unanimously elected Mayor Wu's wife as the chairman of the association, followed by the election of directors and supervisors, the revision of the constitution, and the discussion of proposals. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 p.m.

### Sino-American Hotel Closes

[Our Newspaper] The Sino-American Hotel at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Chengdu Road has recently announced its closure due to sluggish business and excessive losses, starting yesterday. The hotel was organized in June of this year by Chen Yuqiao, Li Guangyao, Xu Yikang, Yu Guoliang, Han Zhiling, and others, with a capital of 120 million yuan in legal currency. Xu Yikang also served as general manager. The night before last, checks issued by the hotel, totaling more than 10 million yuan, were returned due to insufficient funds. The special bill holders Wang Qinggeng, Xiang Rensheng, Han Yongfu, Zhao Jinzhi, Chen Linjiang, etc., reported to the Xincheng Police Sub局 after failing to cash them at the hotel. After questioning the hotel manager Chuan Songling and deputy manager Han Bingjun, they were released on bail. It is reported that the hotel's general manager, Xu Yikang, is avoiding meetings, and the board of directors has hired a lawyer to announce the liquidation.

### Merchant Chen Shuding and Others Accused of Fraud; Three Paper Warehouse Receipts are Not Genuine

[Our Newspaper] The court yesterday heard a major fraud case. Cotton merchant Chen Shuding repeatedly borrowed money from Wang Qifu. In June of this year, in the name of Tailai and Runfeng Yarn and Flower Company, he successively issued seven checks from the Daya Bank, totaling 12,558 million yuan, to repay the debt, but all were returned by the bank due to insufficient funds. Wang approached Chen for negotiations, but Chen avoided meeting and repeatedly delayed. Later, in order to show his ability to repay the debt, Chen colluded with the second defendant, Wu Daonan, to give Wang three warehouse receipts for packaged raw cotton owned by the fictitious Hefeng Enterprise Company, totaling 660 bales, valued at more than 50 million yuan, as collateral. When Wang went to pick up the goods, he discovered that they were all waste cotton. Therefore, he filed a complaint in the court, accusing them of fraud. After the court investigated yesterday, it ordered a rescheduling for further questioning.

### Attempt to Sell Black Market Sugar; Fusheng South Goods Store Offers Bribe

At 6:00 a.m. on the 12th, the Hongkou Police Sub局 received a confidential tip that "Fusheng South Goods Store on Wusong Road is transporting 24 bags of white sugar, worth more than 7 million yuan, in a truck, intending to sell them at black market prices." After receiving the report, the 局 immediately dispatched two police officers, numbers 1240 and 3321, to investigate. The store manager, Zhang Songze, appeared panicked and offered the two police officers 2 million yuan in national currency as a bribe, asking for "help." The two police officers believed that the manager's behavior was an insult to the police and reported the details to their superiors. After receiving the report, Sub局 Director Wang ordered the criminal section to seize all the white sugar and the manager Zhang Songze for thorough investigation.

### Anecdotes by the Racetrack: A Page of Foreigners' History of Encroachment

[Special Feature by This Newspaper] Although the issue of horse racing and racetracks has not yet been formally discussed in the Municipal Council's general assembly, the extent of attention and debate among councilors and citizens regarding these two issues in recent days can be described as feverish.

Attention is being paid, and discussions are taking place, but before we make a decision on this matter, we must understand the truth of the matter. Regarding whether Shanghai should continue to have horse racing, we can decide based on public opinion. What this report will continue to cover is the issue of racetrack property rights, which also involves its history.

For this matter, the reporter specially consulted Councilor Chen Cunren, a standing director of the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Association, who is a disciple of Yao Gonghe, an expert on old Shanghai issues. Therefore, he has a deep understanding of various aspects of Shanghai's history. Historical data on the racetrack is now very scarce. Mr. Chen Cunren spent a lot of valuable time searching through various historical materials and found the following complete story:

An Englishman's Horse, Two Lines of Farmers' Tears

The current racetrack is actually the third one operated by foreigners. As early as 1850 (the 30th year of the Qing Dynasty's Daoguang Emperor), four English directors opened a fairly large open space at the original site of the Nanjing Road ball court, now the site of Lihua Company, for playing billiards and throwing balls, hence the name "ball court." At that time, the Shanghai Daotai (local official) and the British Consul, according to the Yangjingbang Regulations (i.e., the lease agreement), stipulated that each mu (unit of land area) could be purchased for fifteen thousand cash. At that time, the area west of the ball court was all wasteland, devoid of human habitation. In 1854 (the fourth year of the Xianfeng Emperor), the directors of the ball court sold all the land and developed further west, opening a "New Park and Racetrack" in the area around the current Wing On and Sincere department stores. The land area was very large, bordered by Hubei Road, Zhejiang Road, Zhifu Road, and Beihai Road. Later, this area gradually became prosperous. Then, in 1860 (the tenth year of the Xianfeng Emperor), they sold all the real estate at a high price. At this time, the "Battle of Mud City" occurred in Shanghai, which was a conflict between the Small Swords Society and British soldiers at the South Mud City Bridge. The battlefield was north of the South Mud City Bridge, in the area of the New World amusement center. At this time, the entire Sichuan Road was a creek called "Zhoujingbang," and on one side was a foreign creek (i.e., the old Avenue Edward VII). The British army stationed troops on a piece of land west of the Zhoujingbang. At that time, China was in the midst of the Taiping Rebellion, and the imperial court did not pay much attention to this banditry case. As a result, the Small Swords Society declared defeat, and after the troops retreated, the British announced the purchase of land west of Zhoujiabang (Xizang Road) as a new racetrack. The British used a horse, starting from the South Mud City Bridge on Xizang Road (the entrance to the New World), and then went west and south through Luhua Tang (i.e., the current Ma Zhai Road), circling a large area until the intersection of Zhoujing Yangjingbang at the original site of the Eastern Hotel. At each point along the way, wooden markers were erected, and ropes were used to enclose the area. This circle became the current racetrack, covering a total area of 430 mu. However, this circle was entirely composed of Chinese farmers' farmland and ancestral graves. There is no doubt that this was an act of forceful occupation. This was in 1862 (the first year of the Tongzhi Emperor). They then began to force the farmers to sell their land, still at fifteen thousand cash per mu. Many compradors and local guarantors "scraped the land" in the middle, enriching themselves with an unknown amount of silver dollars. After the British forcibly occupied the land, they divided the field into inner and outer circles. However, many disputes also arose. Most of the people refused to sell, and the ancestral graves were unwilling to be moved. Recently, Chen Cunren visited Zhao Jinqing, a prominent figure in Shanghai. It is said that the Zhao family had a twenty-mu cemetery dating back five generations. The local guarantor, who was in charge of moving the graves and the relocation fees, only gave him fifty thousand cash, which he refused to accept. In addition, there is a story to tell: there is still a stone archway in the racetrack, and people suspect that it belongs to the Zhao Jinqing family, and some say that it was built by the Zhang family. In fact, these are all unreliable. This archway was erected by "Zhao, the wife of Xu Yuanlai," and was built in the 53rd year of Qianlong. When Zhao was twenty-three years old, her husband died, and Zhao guarded her chastity and raised her adopted son. She died at the age of eighty-three. The archway is called "Jingjie Archway" (Archway of Chaste Fidelity), and foreigners call it "Widow's Honor Archway." Because the Xu family was very powerful in the area, this archway was not demolished.

Enclosing Land and Reselling It: Foreigners Make a Fortune

After the racetrack was enclosed, the farmers inside the circle were all driven out, and Chinese people were absolutely forbidden to enter. The original landowners were beaten out if they entered. Only a very small number of Chinese people wearing Western suits could occasionally enter accompanied by foreigners. However, the stubborn and violent imperialist forces at that time could not subdue the anger of the people. The people inside the circle protested en masse because their private land was occupied by foreigners, the racetrack changed locations twice and made two big fortunes, and the compradors and local guarantors committed great fraud. The Shanghai Daotai was unable to deal with it and had to exchange documents (i.e., notes) with the British Consul. The document stipulated: "This land, after being purchased, shall be used exclusively for horse racing and playing ball, and shall never be sold or allowed to build other houses unrelated to horse racing and playing ball, or rented or sold." Because of this exchange of documents, the racetrack could no longer repeatedly sell and enclose land. According to Fang Jisheng's History of Shanghai, when the second racetrack (where Sincere and Wing On department stores were located) was sold in 1862, it obtained 49,425 taels of silver. However, when purchasing the current Ma Huo Road racetrack, it only cost 12,500 taels of silver to purchase 430 mu of vast farmland. What an amazing way for Westerners to make a fortune!

In fact, there are 325 property owners in the racetrack, of which only 205 have received payment. The other 120 households firmly refuse to go to receive payment. In 1895 (the 21st year of the Guangxu Emperor), the property owners could no longer bear it and specially hired a British lawyer to file a lawsuit with the consulate. As a result, the British directors were ordered to compensate each property owner with ten taels of silver. However, these 120 households were still unwilling to receive the money. The remaining 1,200 taels were used, with 400 taels as lawyer's fees and 800 taels sent by the British Consul to the Shanghai County Yamen (government office), which posted a notice saying: "We hope that each property owner will come to receive the money. If they still do not come to receive it within three months, it shall be deemed invalid." In the end, didn't that money end up in the pockets of the Yamen officials!

But the property owners still refused to accept it. In the 25th year of Guangxu, when the concession was expanded, the British came up with a good idea, which was to invite some of the old landowners to be grooms at the racetrack. On the one hand, they were also allowed to build wooden temporary stands along the Xiaobang (small creek, recently filled in) on Jing'an Temple Road, stretching from the New World all the way to Ma Huo Road. Those stands were made of a few wooden planks placed on long benches, and a few copper coins were charged for people to watch. The Public Works Department did not collect taxes from them and did not require any permits, which was considered preferential treatment for them. Because Chinese people were still not allowed to step into the inner circle at that time, the business of the stands outside the circle was not bad.

By the first year of Xuantong, the British suddenly changed their plan and opened up the inner circle to Chinese people for ticket purchase. As a result, the stands outside the circle gradually disappeared because the business was sluggish and because of inconvenient transportation after many years.

At that time, the stands inside the circle were also very simple. The old stands were demolished in 1933. On February 28, 1934 (the 23rd year of the Republic of China), the new clock tower building was completed. The above is the story of the racetrack.

To Race or Not to Race: Everyone Has a Different Opinion

Next, we want to talk about the land rights issue of the Shanghai Race Club. The current property owners of the racetrack are related. From the perspective of the Race Club, all members of the club have the right to race. Even if the Municipal Council opposes horse racing, I believe they will still "race." What are the reasons for this? There are mainly three points that they can raise: (1) The club itself has the right to race; (2) Horse racing has athletic qualities (non-members cannot race); (3) The racetrack is private property that is difficult to distinguish from public property. Therefore, the resolution of the last temporary council to rebuild the park, etc., could not be achieved.

So, what is a reasonable way to solve the problem? According to Councilor Chen's observation, the first is: All land should be requisitioned in accordance with the Land Law. According to this law, even legal scholars like Fan Ke cannot refuse (but there is not that much money). Second: The cost of requisitioning land is huge. The ideal way must be for the Municipal Council to organize a special committee to seriously study and draft a plan. However, in principle, it may be based on two points: (1) Imitate the Greater Shanghai Plan and re-raise bonds for organization and implementation. If the mayor plans to extract 20% of the savings fund within two years, this is impossible in fact. If calculated at a monthly collection of 500 million yuan, only 12 billion yuan can be collected in two years. This small amount is not even enough to buy a small piece of land for the horse stable. Even if we race day and night, racing for ten years will not help much. However, Mayor Wu's use of diplomatic skills also has unexpected possibilities, because the property rights of the racetrack have changed back and forth between public and private for ninety-six years. It is not clear what is going on. However, it is essential for the Municipal Council to organize a special committee to search documents, interview old landowners, and study methods (2) According to the regulations of the Race Club, "Horse racing has athletic qualities, and non-members cannot participate." Then, selling tickets publicly violates the original regulations, and buying tickets for gambling violates national laws. The government authorities have the right to intervene and prohibit Chinese people from entering for gambling. In this way, unless the Race Club only wants to use the 430 mu of land to exercise the bodies of foreigners behind closed doors and does not want to make money, then unless the mayor has diplomatic skills or we have the money to requisition the land, there is no way to drive them out.

This is a rather serious problem. In the Municipal Council, the reporter often hears councilors talking about the horse racing issue. But after investigation, it seems that most of them do not approve of horse racing, especially not approving of horse racing in the downtown area. Mayor Wu advocates collecting taxes on horse racing and recovering land rights after two years. This does not mean that he approves of horse racing. He just wants to find a way to recover the land. Regardless of whether his method is ideal, his hard work is worthy of praise.

Today, Shanghai has produced a public opinion body. We hope that the wise representatives of the people can plan a most suitable method for the people of Shanghai to recover our own land. Finding the most effective and concrete methods is often better than theoretical debates and explanations.

### Strict Precautions Taken at the North Railway Station: Thirty Traitors Escorted to Shanghai and Directly Imprisoned in the Xiaozijian Prison at Tilanqiao; Major Traitors Such as Chen Bijun Not Among Them

[Report from This Newspaper] The Judicial Administration Department recently instructed that all adjudicated cases of traitors tried in various places near Shanghai must be transferred to Shanghai prisons for execution. The first batch of thirty people from the Third Jiangsu Prison arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning on the No. 71 local train departing from Changzhou. In advance, it was heard that the group of criminals included major traitors such as Chen Bijun and Chen Zemin, so strict precautions were taken around the platform of the North Railway Station. At 1:05 p.m., the train entered the station. The special train for escorting the traitors was in the last carriage, carriage number TBG 947, responsible for security. The military police loaded live ammunition, and photographers aimed their lenses, making the atmosphere very tense for a while, but there was no sign of Chen Bijun and others. According to Han Yuwen, the chief of the security section of the Third Jiangsu Prison, who was responsible for escorting the criminals to Shanghai, and Li Yurui, the clerk of the Suzhou Higher Court, Chen Bijun has been depressed and bedridden since Chu Minyi was executed. Chen Zemin suffers from a serious illness, and Chen Fumin has a crippled foot. A total of ninety traitors have been sentenced in Suzhou, and the first batch of thirty are being escorted first. There are no major traitors among them. The heaviest sentence is eight years in prison, and the lightest is two years and six months. The other sixty people, including Chen Bijun and others, are awaiting orders and will be prepared to be escorted at any time. These thirty petty traitors were handcuffed in pairs, forming a row, and got off the train in order. Each prisoner carried a small bag or net bag. It was raining heavily at the time. After resting briefly on the platform, they were escorted onto two large buses of the Railway Bureau and driven to the Shanghai Prison in Tilanqiao. After personnel from the prison checked the names one by one and confirmed that there were no errors, they were ordered to be imprisoned in the Xiaozijian Prison. The list of these thirty people is as follows:

Zhou Zhishan (Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), Chuan Tiancai (Yinxian, Zhejiang), Li Yuxiang (Tengxian, Shandong), Cai Ke (Wujin, Jiangsu), Zhang Xuesheng (Kaifeng, Henan), Ye Jiugao (Songjiang, Jiangsu), Jiang Mingchu (Jiangyin, Jiangsu), Zhang Tianlong (Gaochun, Jiangsu), Zhou Muyuan (Changshu, Jiangsu), Cheng Chongli (Changshu, Jiangsu), Qi Yulin (Jiaxing, Jiangsu), Hu Shaoqing (Hefei, Anhui), Wang Yuliang (Wuxi, Jiangsu), Xu Xihuang (Hengjiang, Jiangsu), Gao Wenqi (Wujin, Jiangsu), Shi Xiaowuzi (Yizheng, Jiangsu), Liu Shulin (Linyu, Hebei), He Meilin (Yangzhong, Jiangsu), Zhang Qin (Dongtai, Jiangsu), Jing Zhong (Wujin, Jiangsu), Zhu Yuandong (Wujin, Jiangsu), Tong Liangjun (Gaochun, Jiangsu), Zhu Liansheng (Taixing, Jiangsu), Wang Chunzhi (Songjiang, Jiangsu), Xu Qingyun (Jiading, Jiangsu), Han Jiahong (Jiangyin, Jiangsu), Jiang Honggen (Dazhi, Hubei), Lu Mengqiao (Jiading, Jiangsu), Zhang Shaonan (Xuancheng, Anhui), Shen Changsheng (Wujiang, Jiangsu).

### British Tram Company Suspends Service Yesterday; Expected to Resume Today After Mediation by Various Agencies; Two Ticket Sellers Who Injured Patrol Officers Each Fined 1,000 Yuan and Released

(Report from This Newspaper) The ticket sellers of the No. 20 trolleybus of the British Shanghai Tramways Company and three patrol officers from the Changning Road Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau had a conflict near Zhongshan Park due to a dispute over taking the bus. The ticket sellers were taken to the branch bureau for investigation. Yesterday, the company's drivers, ticket sellers, etc., went on strike. To understand the truth, the reporter specially visited the person in charge of the Municipal Police Bureau, who told us the following: At around 8 p.m. last night (the 13th), the No. 350 trolleybus on Route 20, which runs between Jing'an Temple and Zhongshan Park, arrived at the Zhongshan Park terminal. The passengers were extremely crowded and

Struggling to Get on the Bus

At that time, Zhang Desen, Wang Jigang, and Liu Qiyun, three patrol officers from the Changning Road Branch of the Bureau (all in plainclothes), also boarded the bus with the crowd. Zhang and Wang boarded first. When Liu Qiyun was about to step onto the bus, the ticket seller, Dong Lisheng (number 960), suddenly closed the iron gate. Officer Zhang told him that there was still one person and asked him to open the gate, but the other ticket seller on the bus, Wang Guohua (number 1185), slightly opened the gate and then closed it, causing Liu Qiyun's ankle to be crushed. They argued with each other, and the ticket seller actually used the ticket punch to stab Liu Qiyun's left eyebrow, piercing two holes. Officer Zhang also had a piece of flesh pinched from his arm by the ticket punch. At that time, the three officers did not fight back. They then took the two ticket sellers, Dong Lisheng and Wang Guohua, to the Changning Road Branch for investigation. The chairman of the tram employees' union rushed to the branch bureau upon hearing the news and witnessed that the ticket sellers were

Also Injured

Unexpectedly, someone took the opportunity to incite the employees to strike, expanding the disturbance, causing all British trams to stop running today. Trams are public utilities and cannot be interrupted for even one day. This kind of action is disrupting social order. In this turbulent autumn season, there are deep concerns that there are troublemakers inciting from within. The bureau has the responsibility to maintain social security and order. In addition to advising the tram employees to resume work quickly, those behind the scenes will be investigated and punished according to the law.

Furthermore: After the dispute between the police officer and the tram ticket seller at Zhongshan Garden the night before, the company's comprador, Lu Jichun, accompanied by Qiu Changjiang, chairman of the British Tram Industry Union, drove to the Changning Branch,

Requesting Release

### Shipping Industry Decides to Increase Passenger Ticket Prices by Four and a Half Times; Will Be Implemented from the 21st After Approval by the Ministry

The Ministry of Communications, in view of the large number of irregular freighters in various parts of the country and the very few passenger ships operating on fixed routes, which has led to the stagnation of passenger transport, in order to remedy this situation, recently telegraphed the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau to discuss improvement measures with the Shipping Industry Association and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The board of directors and supervisors of the Shipping Industry Association have decided to restore the "Route Committee" and adjust the sailing schedules of each company on each route to suit supply and demand. It was also decided that the government should grant special rights to regular liners that maintain fixed voyages in order to subsidize them, such as exempting them from dispatching military escorts and allocating fuel at relatively low prices.

### To Maintain Shipping, New Fourth-Class Fares Set

Furthermore, the passenger ticket prices on each route have been adjusted for half a year since March 1 of this year. The shipping companies, in view of the current price increases of several times, the sharp increase in expenses such as repair materials and wages, and the fact that the original passenger ticket prices cannot be maintained, and because the ticket prices are too low, scalpers often purchase passenger tickets from the shipping companies in sets and resell them to passengers at several times the black market price to make profits, while legitimate passengers are harmed. At the request of various companies and the Shipping Industry Association to adjust ticket prices to maintain operations, the joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors of the association and the industry meeting discussed it several times, and the passenger ticket prices were decided to be increased by four and a half times the original price. The new fourth-class fares are as follows: Shanghai-Tianjin line 65,000 yuan, Shanghai-Qingdao line 42,000 yuan, Shanghai-Ningbo line 12,000 yuan, Shanghai-Wenzhou line 18,000 yuan, Shanghai-Fujian line 30,000 yuan, Shanghai-Guangdong line 80,000 yuan, Shanghai-Hankou line 52,000 yuan. The association also decided to implement it from the 21st of this month and will submit a request to the Ministry for approval.

### Typhoon Dissipates; Ships Resume Sailing

### City Land Administration Bureau Section Chief Embezzlement Case: Evidence Obtained Exceeds Ten Million

The City Land Administration Bureau is handling the case of embezzlement related to the return of land in Pudong by the Bridge Enemy Hengchan Joint-Stock Company. Following a secret investigation by Zhu Ping, the director of the Land Administration Bureau, evidence has been obtained confirming that excessive payments were indeed collected.

### Grand Parade of Pickpockets: Guilty, Afraid to Raise Their Heads; Orderly Under Armed Surveillance; The District Attorney's Office Suddenly Faces Overcrowding

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The "Grand Parade of Pickpockets" was solemnly held yesterday morning under the strict guard of fully armed personnel. Many of the "Fleas on a Drum" who participated in the parade kept their heads down under the scrutiny of the public, showing a "guilty, afraid to raise their heads" spectacle. The detectives supervising the parade saw that their hard work had not been in vain. After this "escort," the days of hard work had finally come to an end, and they naturally couldn't help but feel a little smug. However, the gentlemen at the District Attorney's Office, who suddenly found themselves with booming business, were overwhelmed and secretly complaining incessantly!

The "escort" was held in two parts. The first was at 10 a.m., involving 321 pickpockets. It was led by jeeps and motorcycles, followed closely by a squadron of security police, then the car patrol, and finally the "Pickpocket Brigade." They were arranged in rows of three, with excellent order and remarkably synchronized steps. There were no stragglers among the three in each row—why? Because they were connected by handcuffs!

The spectators on both sides of the road were a sea of people. Some said, "It's really good to watch, but it's just missing a military band." These unfortunate people were lucky because it started raining just as they arrived at the District Attorney's Office, which was a relief.

The second group started at 11 a.m. It was less sensational than the first, as only 75 pickpockets participated. They were unlucky; they had only reached the middle of Linsen Road when thunder and lightning began, and a torrential downpour turned the "Fleas on a Drum" into "drenched chickens."

Various Types: A Magnificent Spectacle

This pickpocket brigade consisted of 396 people, divided into three squadrons. There was a wide variety of them, making it a magnificent sight. In terms of clothing, some were impeccably dressed, looking like upper-class people, while most were shabbily dressed and looked haggard. Among these 396 people, there were over twenty children and over twenty women!

The District Attorney's Office really couldn't accommodate so many suddenly arriving "guests." With no other choice, they had to open the iron gates wide to welcome these 396 heroes inside, inviting them to rest in the hall. However, roll call and identification took a long time, until dusk. Seeing that the detention center was already overcrowded, another escort was organized, and a large portion was sent to Tilanqiao—because the "housing shortage" in Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison is not currently very serious.

The task of clearing up pickpockets in Shanghai is the responsibility of the Criminal Police Division of the Police Bureau, headed by the Section Chief of the Second Section, Li Junhou. To handle this transfer, he mobilized 250 detectives. They started working from 8 a.m. yesterday, but the District Attorney's Office was inevitably overwhelmed because it had fewer staff—after the District Attorney's Office, there is the District Court; will there be another exciting performance later?

Many Categories: Caution First

The Police Bureau has investigated the twenty-odd categories and methods of pickpocketing very clearly. Because this newspaper has already recorded them many times, except for a few of the more interesting ones briefly explained below, the others will not be described in detail. As for prevention methods, the Police Bureau wrote the four words "Caution First." In other words, it's still: "Take care of your clothes, hats, and belongings." Although "there is no thousand-year defense against thieves," it is always better to be more careful.

Reaching for the Sky: Using a bamboo pole with a small iron hook tied to it, stealing clothes by reaching into balconies, platforms, or windows when people are unprepared.

Both Sides Shining: Also known as Collapsing Pancake, this involves breaking glass windows after first sticking handkerchiefs or paper on the shop's glass display windows to prevent noise, in order to carry out theft.

Muffled Kiln: Sneaking into shops and residences in the evening, hiding first, and then stealing after people are asleep.

Ground Crawl: Gathering three or five or more people outside shops, wharves, stations, etc., and using fake boxes or packages to cover the objects of others, stealing them away when people are unprepared.

Knocking on the Kerosene Tank: Three or five people use rickshaws to solicit business. When passengers sit on the cushions, they use their buttocks to contact the passengers' pockets, taking the opportunity to pickpocket. After succeeding, they make excuses such as a flat tire or other methods to make the passenger change vehicles.

Running Old Plays: Divided into several types such as Flat Ground, Rolling Plate, Vegetable Household, and Bottom. This involves pickpocketing on the road, trams, buses, or vegetable markets. The Bottom type involves pickpocketing on ships. The methods involve using blades to cut bags, pliers to pinch, or scissors to cut open.

Leading the Yellow Ox: An accomplice takes a rickshaw to a destination. Under the pretext of paying the fare, they make the rickshaw pull away with them, while another accomplice steals the rickshaw.

### Xikang Promotes Border Education: Adopts the "Three-izations" Education Policy

[News from Kangding, Our Newspaper] The Education Department of Xikang Province is promoting border education and has now determined three principles to proceed step by step, as follows: (1) Adopting the "Three-izations" education policy, namely Moralization, Modernization, and Assimilation, as the highest principle for promoting border education in Xikang Province. (2) According to the instructions of the Ministry of Education, "Border education emphasizes quality over quantity." Schools in areas that are too remote and sparsely populated will be abolished and merged to strengthen existing schools. (3) Focusing on improving the lives of border residents. Border areas have underdeveloped cultures and primitive production technologies. The construction of border areas should involve communicating the cultures of various ethnic groups and improving the lives of border residents. Therefore, school facilities should focus on improving cultural standards and imparting production technology. The teaching materials and methods used should all be based on this standard. However, border areas lack grassroots administrative cadres, making it difficult to promote administrative work below the county level. Training in the basics of local autonomy is emphasized, and the implementation method is planned to be completed in four years.

### Jinan University Dismisses Professors: Holds Reception for Reporters Yesterday, Chaired by Professor Yu Jianhua

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since Li Shouyong took over as president of National Jinan University, only about forty of the more than one hundred and fifty reinstated professors have been rehired, causing widespread indignation. Yesterday (the 14th) at 3:00 p.m., the reinstated but not rehired professors of the university held a special meeting at the YMCA of the Eight Immortals Bridge in this city to express their views to the press. Over thirty reporters from newspapers and news agencies attended. Professor Yu Jianhua chaired the meeting and first reported on the university's internal situation. During the period of turmoil, the dismissed professors had all moved west with the school, sticking to their posts despite the hardships. However, upon returning, they were treated with such discrimination, which was unexpected. Subsequently, Professor Zou Youhua reported on the negotiations with President Li, saying that although the dismissed professors sent representatives to negotiate with him repeatedly, President Li always prevaricated and did not reach any results, and pushed all the responsibility to the deceased President He Bingsong, claiming that President He had individual criticisms of the original professors. However, this argument is clearly not true. According to Miss He, the daughter of President He, President He first came to Shanghai this spring to prepare for the school's restoration. In April, he sent a letter to the Jianyang campus, saying that the school's restoration was already in order and inviting all professors to come to Shanghai to cooperate. She can testify against President Li's slander. Later, Professor Zhang Li stated that many of the dismissed professors had worked for ten or twenty years. They had long regarded teaching as a lifelong career, so they hoped that the press would give them sincere sympathy and strong support.

### Civil Affairs Department Explains Doubts Regarding Household Registration Law

The Shanghai Municipal Civil Affairs Department recently received an urgent request from the Fourth District Office regarding three points of doubt about the Household Registration Law, and has issued the following clarifications after review: (1) Article 11, paragraph 2 of the Implementing Rules of the Household Registration Law stipulates that "If there are household affiliates with different natures within a household, separate households should be established according to their natures." Its interpretation can refer to Article 8, paragraph 2 of the Shanghai Municipal Household Registration Handling Regulations, "If a household is under the same manager in the same location and serves as a joint enterprise and joint life, it shall be regarded as a joint enterprise household." That is, those not in the same location or not under the same manager are regarded as affiliated in nature and should establish separate households according to their natures. (2) The request to inspect the household registration book or deliver a transcript for a fee is limited to interested parties. If a lawyer requests the household registration director to inspect the household registration book or deliver a transcript on behalf of a party, a letter of authorization from the party must be presented, and the inspection fee or copy fee should still be paid. (3) The amount of the inspection fee and copy fee is too small, and a request to increase it is currently being sent to the central government. After a reply is received, another order will be issued for compliance.

### Total Registration of Pregnant Women Held in the 23rd District

The 23rd District Office recently approved a letter from the Wusong Health Office stating that midwifery work is an important part of promoting maternal and infant health. However, most rural women rely on midwives who are unfamiliar with disinfection procedures, resulting in many maternal deaths each year. A general registration of pregnant women is planned to be conducted to send staff to visit and examine them and to facilitate delivery. The district has now notified all Bao to actively investigate and register. In addition, the 9th Bao of the district (Wusong) plans to add a Jia as the 11th Jia due to the recent surge in residents, and has nominated Bai Rufu as the Jia leader, which has been submitted to the municipal government for approval.

### Reassignment of the 29th District Chief, Dismissal of the Chief Executive Zhou Zhongke

Liu Ding, the Chief of the 29th District of Shanghai, has another concurrent position and does not regularly reside in the district office, neglecting his duties. Yesterday, the municipal government dismissed him. The vacant position has been temporarily filled by Zhu Yougu, the Deputy District Chief. In addition, Zhou Zhongke, the Chief Executive of the District Office, falsely reported a leave of absence and stayed in Shanghai. Yesterday, the municipal government dismissed him. The vacancy will be filled by Shi Zhenting, a discharged youth soldier.

### The Fourth District Examines Bao Secretaries

In order to understand the work of each Bao and strengthen the Baojia organization, the Fourth District Office prepared a weekly work report last month, which was distributed to the Bao secretaries to fill out, and the weekly work report was listed as one of the attendance evaluations. Anyone who is absent from a Bao secretary meeting will receive a reprimand for the first absence and a demerit for the second absence.

### The 26th District Investigates Farmers, Plans to Request the Issuance of Insecticides

The 26th District of Shanghai (Longhua) is located in the suburbs, and most of the people are engaged in agriculture.

Now, the District Chief Chen Kai has ordered each Bao to investigate and fill out information about farmers in order to transfer it to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to allocate UNRRA-JDC disease and pest control drugs for prevention and treatment.

### Q & A on Household Registration Regulations (Continued)

(5) Statistics Category

Q: If a woman has fled and her whereabouts are unknown, which table should she be included in for statistics?

A: When counting migratory populations, she should be included in the outgoing population, but her household registration should be retained.

Q: Can the migration household registration statistics be combined with the establishment and cancellation of registration?

A: The natures are different and cannot be combined.

Q: Can the item "Transfer Registration" in the Household Registration Change Statistics in the Household Registration Statistical Report Form (5) be increased to two items: "Transfer In" and "Transfer Out"?

A: Transfer In and Transfer Out of Transfer Registration are different from Establishment of Registration and Cancellation of Registration. The former is carried out simultaneously and is a procedure to be handled in the transfer registration, while the latter cannot be carried out simultaneously and the procedures are also different. The Household Registration Law has other regulations. After handling the Transfer Registration, separate applications for Registration Establishment and Registration Cancellation are still required. The reason why Transfer Registration is listed in one column in the Household Registration Statistical Report Form (5) is to record the total number of Transfer In and Transfer Out, so there is no need to divide it into two columns.

### Too Many Difficulties in the Knitting Industry: Two-Thirds are Shut Down; Industry Seeks a Way Out as Peak Season Nears.

[Our reporter] recently spoke with people in the knitting industry about the current situation of the industry, and they told me that the industry is currently in a difficult environment. Their specific difficulties are: (1) The Spinning and Weaving Company allocates yarn and thread equally to large and small factories, resulting in large factories having to rely on the black market when raw materials are insufficient, which increases production costs. (2) After the exchange rate adjustment, factories that started production felt even more difficulties. Because the yarn and thread from the black market, and other raw materials such as caustic soda, pigments, etc., all rose in price following the exchange rate adjustment. However, most of the products of the knitting industry maintained their original prices. Even if there were adjustments, they did not exceed 10% at most. The price increase of products and raw materials was not balanced. The general difficulties include: (1) High-interest loans pose the greatest threat to the industry. Generally speaking, a profit of about 1.5% is considered good for the industry. However, the current hidden interest rate is about the same as this profit. Therefore, if short-term loans are used for operation, the profit earned is just enough to cover the interest expenses, and all other expenses still need to be subsidized. (2) Labor disputes are not as serious in the industry as in other industries, but it is still hoped that the labor unions will understand the difficulties of the times and give full play to the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation.

It is reported that there are currently 618 members in the industry association. Among them, only 108 use electric motors, and the rest are hand-operated loom factories. Therefore, large factories account for about one-fourth of the total. Due to the impact of the above-mentioned difficulties, more than 400 factories have shut down. Most of the remaining 200 or so are also in a semi-operational state. Only about 50 factories are really able to operate every day. The operating rate of each factory is only about 20% of what it was before the war. An operating rate of 20% or more is already considered rare. In terms of sock production, the industry could produce about 100,000 dozen socks per day before the war, but now it is less than 20,000 dozen. However, because the production is limited, sales are still good. It is said that the current peak season for knitted products has arrived, and according to the usual practice, supply should be in short supply. However, due to the obstruction of transportation in various places, sales in other regions are greatly affected. In Southeast Asia, although the export price has slightly improved after this exchange rate adjustment, the quantity is very small and is limited to the small Luzon area. In other areas, it is temporarily impossible to develop because the Sino-British Commercial Treaty has not yet been finalized.

The industry is currently planning to find solutions to the current difficulties. The industry association will notify all its members: (1) To assist the government in its decision to stabilize prices and firmly maintain the original prices before the exchange rate adjustment. (2) It is reported that some members of the industry are transferring the cotton yarn warehouse receipts allocated by the Spinning and Weaving Company. This should be strictly investigated and prohibited. In terms of improving the allocation of yarn, the industry association will prepare a recent production status report on the current situation of the industry, clarifying the number of machines in each factory and the actual situation of yarn consumption, so as to provide a reference for the Spinning and Weaving Company to allocate goods. At the same time, it is hoped that the Four Allied Relief Agencies can provide the industry with reasonable loans. For example, when providing loans, do not insist on using raw materials as collateral, but use various real estate, factory buildings, machines, etc. as alternatives to ease the difficulties of merchants. It is also hoped that when the agency lends funds, it can negotiate directly with the various manufacturers to avoid repeated contacts and create abuses.

### Gold Prices are Narrowly Fluctuating, Few US Dollar Transactions

Yesterday, gold initially showed fatigue but then stabilized, possibly due to eager customer sales. It opened at 2.145 million, and after opening, supply and demand were balanced, and trading was narrow. It rose slightly from 2.135 million to 2.155 million. The central bank had some controls, and rallies were curbed. After 10:00 AM, the central bank allocated 120 taels at a price of 2.1425 million. After that, trading was small again, falling to 2.135 million before entering the trading day. In the end, due to the eagerness of customer sales from Fujian and Shantou, buying interest did not wane. At noon, trading rose to around 2.16 million. There was not much trading in the afternoon due to Saturday. As a result, it closed 14,000 higher than the previous close. Decorative gold was quoted at 29,000. Both silver bullion and silver dollars showed little change. The underground discount rate ranged from 14% to 17%.

There were no special changes in foreign currencies. The US dollar opened at 3,390 yuan in the morning and remained around 3,380 yuan throughout the middle of the day. There were few transactions. At noon, it rose slightly to around the morning opening price due to the rise in the overnight price. There was still little change in the afternoon. As a result, it closed 10 yuan higher than the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were slightly stable, closing 5 yuan higher than the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 695 yuan to 705 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 840 yuan to 850 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 11,200 yuan to 11,400 yuan. The US exchange rate remained at the official rate.

### Increased Trading in Government Bonds

Government bonds traded slightly better yesterday, with increased trading. As a result, people inevitably became more bullish. Unified Class C opened at 2,500 yuan, with a high price of 2,570 yuan. There were also more bulls selling, and it retreated to 2,300 yuan at closing. As a result, it closed 80 yuan higher than the previous close. Miscellaneous brands were favored by more people and all saw prosperity. Class A and B bonds were up 150 yuan, Class D bonds were up 100 yuan, and Class E bonds were only up 70 yuan. Transactions reached 6 million yuan in par value. People had mixed views on the Four Allied Relief Agencies' proposal to double the repayment of deposits.

### Autumn Sales Begin, Yarn Market Firm

The yarn market remained firm yesterday. Autumn sales are gradually picking up, and all the gangs have buying interest, with combed yarn being the most popular. However, the supply of spot goods is also low, so the price only increased by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. If there were no government order prohibiting shipments to South China, the yarn price would definitely be even more prosperous. The prices of 16-count and 42-count double-stranded yarn were similar to the previous day, with both gains and losses. People's hearts are stable, and the future is quite optimistic.

### Rayon Actual Sales Are Not Weak

Yesterday, rayon was slightly weak in the morning. 120-count Tianqiao was priced at 2.7 million to 2.72 million yuan. In the afternoon, because actual sales were not weak and because transactions had to be settled the day after tomorrow, the price was raised by another 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Miscellaneous brand 120-count Jin San Ma bright rayon was 2.65 million yuan in the morning and about 2.7 million yuan in the afternoon. Semi-dull rayon was 2.3 million yuan in the morning and 2.35 million yuan in the afternoon. There were no transactions in 75 semi-dull rayon. Factory silk transactions were rare, and prices fluctuated around the original price. Silk fabrics were quite stable, and market prices did not change.

### Eager Customer Sales of Wool Fabrics

The wool fabric market continued to be active. The Sichuan, Hunan, Beijing, and Hangzhou gangs were all strongly adding goods. Melton overcoats, grass green and navy blue gabardine, suit flannels, and Xuanwei were all in high demand. Because the Autumn Festival has passed, actual sales of Chinese and Western wool fabrics are extremely active. The business of various military uniform stores is increasing steadily. Due to transportation issues, if purchases and shipments are not made now, the goods will be late for the sales season. Therefore, winter overcoat fabrics are also being purchased one after another, making transactions even more lively.

### Transaction Tax Temporarily Not Collected, Stock Exchange Set to Open Tomorrow, Commission: 3/1000 for Stocks, 2/1000 for Bonds

[Our Reporter] Yesterday, the stock exchange held its last rehearsal, and the results were considered satisfactory. At the same time, the stock exchange has accepted the suggestions of various brokers to enlarge the blackboards on the east and west corridors and to list the buying and selling prices separately. There are 18 trading counters in the market, of which 6 were arranged in a row, and have been removed. The remaining 12 are arranged in a large circle. The 20 listed stocks are assigned to the 6 trading counters in the inner circle. A new blackboard has been added to each trading right to write the stock buying and selling prices. When brokers engage in transactions in the 6 trading counters, they can clearly see the stock market prices on the blackboards from all sides, without the difficulties of the rehearsal. The stock exchange authorities also said that they would try their best to adopt and implement suggestions from all parties if they have real improvement value.

The Shanghai Stock Exchange held its first second joint meeting of directors and supervisors at the Securities Building yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, presided over by Mr. Du Yong. More than 20 people including Chen Guangfu, Li Fuson, Qian Xinzhi, Xu Jiching, and Xu Weiming attended. The chairman and others reported separately, and then discussed and passed the exchange's organizational outline and decided that September 16 would be the official opening date, first conducting one morning session. The remaining decisions were: (1) Each broker is required to have 5 business clerks. (2) The commission issue will be temporarily assumed by the exchange before the establishment of the brokers' association, including the handling fee. The commission for stock company prices is 3/1000 (ie 30/10,000), and the commission for government bonds is 2/1000. The above is what is charged to customers. (3) The substitutes for the guarantee deposit will be announced by the bank designated by the central bank and sent to various brokers. Temporarily use a written guarantee to exchange securities and real estate within one month. (4) The transaction tax will not be collected temporarily and will be implemented after being passed and announced by the authorities. (5) Report the opening date to the two ministries of finance and economy and send letters to the exchange supervisors. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM. Another report said that the Ministry of Finance had previously stipulated that the transaction tax would be 10/10,000, but it has now been revised by the Legislative Yuan to 5/10,000, to be borne by the seller.

### Autumn Cocoon Loans to Begin Tomorrow, Cocoons Can Be Collected on the 20th

After several consultations with relevant parties, this year's autumn cocoon loans will be officially launched tomorrow (the 16th) morning. The amount of this loan will be borne solely by the China Farmers Bank. The organization of its institutions is very different from the "spring cocoon loans." Its technical personnel and administrative aspects are uniformly managed by the China Silk Corporation. The loan will begin on the 16th. On the 18th, the Shanghai remittance will be paid to cocoon merchants in various places. On the 20th, various places can officially begin to purchase cocoons. The China Silk Corporation has accepted applications from cocoon merchants since yesterday. As of the afternoon, 17 companies had applied, and the total number of companies is about 50 or more. In addition, the China Silk Corporation will send staff to each cocoon firm that has obtained a loan. The tasks of these resident staff members are (1) to be responsible for filling in the daily amount and quality of cocoons purchased, and (2) to supervise the incoming and outgoing accounting of each firm to prevent fraud.

### Subsidy Fees to be Issued Within Days

In order to help silk farmers and manufacturers, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, in conjunction with the China Silk Corporation and the Zhejiang Provincial Government, decided to reduce the sale of autumn seeds by half this year, with the half price being subsidized by the government. It is learned that various silkworm seeds in this province have already been closed, and the government subsidy is stipulated to be advanced by the Central Trust Bureau, totaling 110,000,000 yuan in Jiangsu Province. The various branches of the China Farmers Bank are responsible for handling the matter, and the funds will be issued within days. Seed farms that have not received loans should submit their subsidy requests according to the actual number of seeds sold.

### Hankou Tung Oil Arrives in Shanghai

[Our Reporter] The Changxing ship of the Sanbei Company arrived at the port in the evening of the day before yesterday and berthed at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong, with more than 1,350 pieces of tung oil and more than 300 pieces of flue-cured tobacco from Hankou.

### Chinese Stocks Show Strength in Unpopular Sectors, Foreign Stocks Have Excellent Potential

Chinese stocks also turned prosperous, with unpopular stocks showing even more strength. Most are preparing to launch at high prices when the stock exchange officially reopens in the coming days. Searches are eager. All stocks saw gains along the way, but higher prices struggled. The closing results were higher than the previous close. Yongsha and Meiya each rose slightly, and Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each rose by about 5%. The mid-sized stocks in the more unpopular sectors were stable, and the small stocks also rose by about half a percent. The veteran stocks remained at their original prices. Small stocks that have been approved for listing attract general retail investors to follow due to their low prices, showing more strength.

Foreign stocks turned from stable to firm yesterday. Buying interest was even higher at the close, with excellent potential. Jardine Silk rose from 9,300 yuan to 9,700 yuan, and British American Tobacco rose from 11,300 yuan to 11,800 yuan. The closing results were Jardine Silk, Papermaking, and Shipping up half a percent, and BAT up 10%. Hongkong Land and Jardine Brewery rose slightly, while Hongkong Electric and Hongkong Steel were flat.

### 2,000 Dan of Raw Silk Purchased, Payment Available Tomorrow

[Our Reporter] The Central Trust Bureau's purchase of raw silk made from this year's spring cocoons began on the 10th. As of the weekend, more than 2,100 dan had been submitted to the Central Trust Bureau. Most of the quality was CD grade, with a small number below D grade. F grade has not yet been found. The results are quite satisfactory. The prices to be paid are 3.8 million yuan per dan for D grade and above, and 3.3 million yuan per dan for E grade. In the future, after the value is determined, it will be calculated according to the actual weight, with overpayments returned and underpayments made up. The silk was purchased by the Central Trust Bureau, and checks have been issued to the manufacturers in full today. The Central Bank will deduct the spring cocoon loans, labor loans, and 10% of the autumn cocoon loans when the checks are presented for payment, and then return the balance to the manufacturers. However, because the China Silk Corporation still needs to review the release of autumn cocoon loans before submitting the forms to the bank, the procedures for withdrawing funds from the Central Bank will be delayed until next Monday (the 16th). (Heng)

### 2,000 Dan of Spring Silkworm Dried Cocoons, China Farmers Bank Purchases at Full Price

The China Farmers Bank conducted spring silkworm dried cocoon loans in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces in May this year, with a limit of three months, which has now expired, and the silkworm farmers have not yet sold them. The bank has now decided to purchase them at full price. The target of this loan is the silkworm farmers' cooperatives. After the silkworm farmers dry the fresh cocoons, they mortgage them to the Farmers Bank at 70% of the price, totaling more than 2,000 dan. The Farmers Bank is purchasing all of them this time and has raised the cocoon price to 655,000 yuan per dan. After signing a contract with the representatives of the various cooperatives on the 13th, it immediately purchased more than 1,700 dan and will complete the purchase within days. It is reported that after the Farmers Bank purchases them, it will entrust the Chongyu Silk Factory to reel the silk for overseas sales, which is expected to produce 500 dan of silk.

### Preliminary Discussion on the Valuation of Assets Prepared by Banks and Firms

Before accepting the asset declaration of each member bank and firm, the Silver Money Industry Joint Preparatory Committee should first stipulate the various prices of (1) bonds and securities, (2) investment certificates, (3) real estate, and (4) cargo warehouse receipts for unified regulations. On the afternoon of the 13th, the committee convened experts from various industries in the city at the Bankers Association, with Mr. Li Fuson presiding, for a preliminary discussion. Those present included Li Shuxiong, He Sandao (real estate industry), Yu Mingshi (stock industry), etc. Representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Wang Bietang, representatives from the Central Bank, Wang Liangqin, and Shen Rixin and Wang Yangsu from the Qianye industry were also invited to participate. On the spot, the experts exchanged opinions on the above-mentioned regulations on the property to be paid, based on the current market price. Mr. Li Fuson also proposed on the spot to invite the experts to set up small subcommittees, and integrate them into a valuation committee, and under the guidance of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank, re-evaluate the prices of the properties to be paid. According to the information, the committee previously sent letters to various members to limit the time to determine the amount of assets to be prepared. As of yesterday, more than 100 members have responded with their asset declaration.

### Indica Rice Market Price Continues to Fall, Trade in Miscellaneous Grains Sluggish

Yesterday, the rice market's digestion remained sluggish, with a total of more than 9,000 Shi of goods registered. There were slight differences between the north and south markets. In the north market, the higher-quality freshly harvested indica and japonica rice from the port were firm, but the customer indica rice from Zhongguan was still weak and little traded. The newly produced Yinyuan continued to fall by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. In the south market, the newly produced Baiyuan and Yinyuan also fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Various kinds of indica rice were down by more than 1,000 yuan. The freshly harvested japonica was similar, but the Duxian and Zhanxian were uniformly depressed in both the north and south markets. Flour shops' demand turned strong, rising slightly by 100 yuan, forming a fluctuating situation. Rice bran was flat, Xiaochou and Minhua were sluggish, the Ningbo gang was also relaxed, the north was still, and the market was mediocre. There was a slight arrival of soybeans from the northeast, and they remained highly fixed and slowly sold. Corn from Qingdao was suspended, and the price fell by another 500 to 600 yuan. Sesame from Southeast Asia was suspended, and there were few transactions on the street, with prices falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Broad beans from Guangzhou were not accepted and were shortened by another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, with few transactions. Broad beans were still trending weakly, softening by 300 to 500 yuan. Red sorghum was similar. The supply of the oil market was ample, falling by a small 1,000 yuan. Bean cake was sluggish, falling by 200 yuan.

### Ample Inventory, Paper Prices Unlikely to Rise

According to paper industry insiders, the current inventory of various types of paper in this city is quite substantial. There is also a large influx of Soviet newspapers, which has led to sluggish sales of domestically produced paper and a slump in paper prices. It is unlikely that there will be any improvement in the short term. For example, the Jiangnan and Tianzhang paper mills, which are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, have recently reduced the production of newsprint and are now producing high-quality writing paper and banknote paper due to poor sales. However, the United States has recently experienced a paper shortage, and paper merchants in this city have stopped ordering paper from the United States. At the same time, prices in the United States have also risen, making it more cost-effective to purchase spot goods from the timber market. According to industry insiders, Canada, Sweden, and Finland are the only major paper-producing regions in the world that can export large quantities of paper in addition to meeting their own needs. All other countries must rely on foreign supplies. Although there is currently a large stock of paper in this city, it is said that the various factories under the Ministry of Economic Affairs have planned to significantly increase the production of newsprint next year.

### Chengda Opens Tomorrow

Chengda Bank has a long history and strong reputation in the rear area. The General Manager, Zhang Yuliang, has now established a Shanghai branch on Sichuan Middle Road, which is scheduled to open on the 16th. According to the industry news obtained by this newspaper, the bank has been approved to join the Shanghai Banking Association as a member and has been granted direct exchange number 182 by the Central Bank Clearing House. Chengda is the first bank in Shanghai to join the Banking Association and obtain a direct exchange number.

### Monthly Oil Demand: 36,000 Dans; Supply Reaches 40,000 Dans

Since the establishment of the Review Committee and the revision of the supply and sale methods, the edible oil market in this city has improved. For the past week, the price of rapeseed oil has been capped at 86,000 yuan, and the price of soybean oil has been capped at 93,000 yuan, and has remained unchanged. The price of vegetable oil supplied and sold by the China Vegetable Oil Factory was already 1,000 yuan lower than the capped price on the 13th, at 85,000 yuan per unit, including delivery. Only raw oil has a slight black market, with the capped price being 97,000 yuan and the black market price being 101,000 yuan. This phenomenon should be easy to eliminate. The China Edible Oil Company has more than 10,000 dans of oil in stock, which will be distributed by the China Vegetable Oil Factory within the next week, at 100 barrels per day. If the China Vegetable Oil Factory resumes its plan to supply and sell 200 barrels per month, the market price will certainly not increase again. The monthly demand in this city is no more than 36,000 dans. The Review Committee has decided that the China Vegetable Oil Factory will supply 10,000 dans per month, the China Edible Oil Company will supply 10,000 dans, and private factories will supply 20,000 dans, for a total of 40,000 dans, which is more than enough to supply the market. The market can be stabilized, and there should be no problems.

### Peach Kernel Powder and Dried Noodles Fall Back

Peach kernels, which had risen to more than 400,000 yuan due to shortages, have fallen sharply recently due to continuous arrivals from Hankou. The lowest price quoted was 260,000 yuan. Dried vermicelli noodles have also fallen back by about 30 percent, to only 320,000 yuan.

### Arrival of Goods Causes a Plunge in Job's Tears

The inventory of Job's tears was depleted, and the market price had reached a peak. Now, large quantities have been transported from Yuzhou at very low cost. As a result, market sentiment is weak, and prices have plummeted. Even with a price reduction of 240,000 yuan, there are few inquiries.

### Chen Needle Eyebrow Green Tea: Sales in Africa

Needle Eyebrow green tea, which is sold to Africa, has recently received repeated telegrams requesting the packing of old stock. As a result, the market for this type of tea has been very active in recent days. Other types of tea are also selling well for export, especially Fujian small bud tea. As for the B.O.P. mark Taiwan fine black tea, which is being watched by Indian merchants, the supply is still lacking. Although local tea factories are trying to imitate it, the quality of the product is poor, and buyers are not satisfied, so the price is low, only between 94,000 and 95,000 yuan per dan. However, according to the suppliers, they are reluctant to sell at that price due to high costs, so the situation remains stagnant. Domestic sales of red and green tea, on the other hand, remain brisk.

### Twelfth Bayer Allocation: From the 19th to the 23rd

The Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory Liquidation Office has decided to hold the twelfth allocation of German drugs, starting on the 19th and ending on the 23rd. Late submissions will be considered as a waiver. This allocation involves 238 companies and a total of about 390 groups, each with more than 40 types of drugs, with a total value of 160 million yuan.

### Caustic Soda Shortage: Rumors of Arrivals from Taiwan

Yesterday, caustic soda was uniquely strong because there were few foreign arrivals and local inventories were dwindling. In addition, the Tianjin-Sichuan merchants were purchasing it. It was found that dyeing, weaving, and mercerizing factories in this city were working day and night, and actual sales were increasing. The price rose by 100,000 yuan per 300 kilograms. According to industry insiders, if there are no more arrivals of this product in the future, the outlook may remain positive. There were arrivals of sulfuric acid, and the price plummeted.

The Taiwan Alkali Manufacturing Company has recently been working hard to promote production in all departments. It is said that it is now able to produce solid caustic soda in large quantities and is preparing to transport it to Shanghai for sale.

### Exchange Rate of Northeastern Currency: Black Market Lower Than Official Rate; Executive Yuan Economic Commission Discussing Measures

[Special Dispatch from Shenyang by This Newspaper on the 14th] The official exchange rate between legal tender and Northeastern currency remains at thirteen to one. The black market rate has recently fluctuated between 10.05 yuan and 9.5 yuan for one yuan of Northeastern currency. This black market is controlled by dozens of money changers at Shanhai Pass. The Finance Group of the Executive Yuan Economic Commission is currently discussing plans to regulate it. Some people argue that the rate of thirteen to one should be maintained. Their reason is that if the official exchange rate changes to twelve or ten to one, the black market will change to nine or eight to one, which is beyond prediction, and the government will become passive. It would be best for the Bank of China to set up an office in Yu and exchange large amounts of currency to take the initiative. Others argue that it should be set according to the actual situation, because this issue is of great concern to civil servants remitting family expenses and prices both inside and outside the customs.

### China's Import and Export Situation: American Businessmen Express Surprise; Industrial Raw Material Prices Two to Three Times Higher Than in the United States; Raw Materials Exported, Finished Products Ordered from Abroad

[Reuters, New York, 13th] According to authoritative American manufacturers, although the commercial situation in China has not yet stabilized, the import of industrial chemical raw materials to China is expected to continue to increase. Orders from China are constantly arriving. Due to the excess arrivals, high prices have started to react. For example, a 300-kilogram drum of caustic soda sells for the equivalent of 780 US dollars. However, the market price in Shanghai is generally still two or three times higher than in the United States. However, some Chinese merchants have been forced to sell their inventories at prices below cost, or even without profit. Currently, 2,000 tons of sodium bicarbonate have been shipped or are on their way to Shanghai. The price of a 100-pound bag has fallen from 60 US dollars to 14 US dollars, but demand remains extremely active. Although China has its own sulfuric acid plants, it has recently received an order for 40 tons of sulfuric acid. Other inquiries include tannic acid, whose raw material, gallnut, used to occupy an important position in China's exports.

### The Examination System and Nation-Building

— Cheng Tixuan

It has been nearly eighteen years since the establishment of the Examination Yuan. During these eighteen years, the overall situation has experienced countless storms, and the country has suffered unprecedented disasters. The land is scarred, and everything is difficult. However, in the past, even in the midst of war, the government authorities were able to hold grand talent selection ceremonies to select capable individuals for the country. Now that we have entered a period of peace and national construction, and all kinds of construction require talent, it is even more necessary to strengthen the examination system. The reasons for this, such as (1) meeting the needs of nation-building work, (2) achieving the goal of an all-encompassing government, and (3) avoiding the unrest caused by partisan politics, are already self-evident. Now, please allow me to briefly express my hopes for the examination authorities:

(1) Quantitative Coordination: People, time, place, things, and objects must be coordinated to achieve success. This is the working method that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has instructed us to follow. If we expand its scope, then the location of all large and small institutions in the country, the people they need, the tasks they perform, and the materials they should have, should all have accurate statistics. Because only with accurate statistics can we talk about appropriate coordination; and the central examination agency should be responsible for coordinating all personnel throughout the country. Therefore, I think the examination authorities should first conduct a general personnel survey of all institutions in the country (including central and local ones). After the survey is completed, they should pay attention to its dynamic registration at any time. Even without specific job classifications to rely on, they can at least statistically determine how many people hold senior positions, how many people hold junior positions; how many people are involved in ordinary administrative work, and how many people are involved in professional technical work; what is the average annual death rate? How many people retire or change careers each year? By marking these things out one by one, we can understand the overall picture of the nation's personnel. On the one hand, we can know what kind of talent is most lacking and what kind of talent urgently needs to be supplemented, as a reference for holding various types of examinations; on the other hand, we can use temporary examinations and regular performance appraisals to eliminate those who do not meet the standards, and gradually promote those who pass the examinations. By gradually promoting in this way, we can link the relationship between examination and appointment, and slowly achieve consistency in the quantity of both.

(2) Qualitative Improvement: The progress of the times is constantly changing. The "private secretary" organization and the "bureaucratic" style are no longer applicable to the era of democracy and science. Today, only people with many talents and abilities are sufficient to manage the public and shoulder the affairs of the state. The role of the examination is to eliminate mediocrity and select true talent to serve the country. If the threshold is too low, mediocre people will be promoted, losing the original intention of selecting officials. However, the best way to improve the quality of officials is to proceed separately, starting from the root. That is, the examination authorities and the education authorities should maintain close contact. Examinations are about getting talent, and talent comes from schools. Without good education, how can there be excellent talent? Without talent, how can there be examinations! Since the War of Resistance, due to the unease of wartime emotions and the inadequacy of material conditions, the level of education has inevitably declined slightly. How to try to remedy this in the future, so that the young students in school can all become useful talents to the country, is something that the examination and education authorities should pay attention to. Secondly, the examination authorities should establish objective standards when holding various types of examinations, and be strict in the selection process, preferring to have vacancies rather than to admit unqualified people, preferring to be precise rather than to be too lenient, preferring to go too far rather than not far enough. If we can do this, I think the quality of officials will improve day by day, and at the same time, the function of the examination will become more and more prominent.

(3) Strengthening the Power of Appointment Review: Today, it is almost impossible for the personnel promotion and demotion of all institutions to come solely from examinations. Because: (1) Although China has had an examination system for a long time, whenever there is a time of decline and chaos, the laws are abandoned, and personal feelings are valued in the appointment of people, without a spirit and habit of abiding by the law. The so-called "when one person attains enlightenment, even his dogs and chickens ascend to heaven," this style still has remnants. (2) A group of unscrupulous scholars all regard becoming an official as a talisman and making money as a goal. They are often driven by the desire for profit and run through the back door, without any sense of shame, and abandon the right path of examination. (3) The National Government has been established for less than twenty years. In the autumn of its founding, all streams advanced together, most of which did not belong to the scope of examinations; and there were so-called "recommendation" methods and "exception" discussions. There are many ways to become an official, and the examination is not the only limit. But despite the reality, we should not be satisfied with the reality, but think about ways to improve it. The so-called ways to improve can be divided into two aspects: on the one hand, the law on the appointment of civil servants should be revised to reduce the qualification clauses and emphasize the spirit of examination; and another powerful and effective control is to strengthen the power of appointment review. All institutions must go through the stage of review when hiring new personnel. The Ministry of Personnel has the great responsibility of handling the review of appointments, and should use this as an opportunity for the promotion and demotion of talent. Those who do not meet the standards and regulations should be rejected and not used, waiting for the qualified talents who pass the examination. In this way, not only can the authority of the examination be established, but also the personnel who pass the examination will no longer feel the difficulty of distribution and the difficulty of promotion.

The above three points are my humble suggestions to the examination authorities. Finally, I would like to express my hopes for those who pass the examination.

(A) There must be performance: Among those who pass the examination and start working in the organization, there are many who gain the trust of their superiors and the love of their colleagues; but there are also many who are placed in unimportant positions and regarded as idlers. When we examine the reasons for this, we either say that the ability of those who pass the examination is not necessarily better than those who have not taken the examination, or we say that their experience is lacking. I think a person who is willing to participate in the examination and has passed the examination, his ability will not be too bad. Perhaps he is not used in the right place, so that his ability has no place to develop, or even is wasted. But in any case, I always hope that comrades who have passed the examination must be self-reliant, firm, and overcome all difficulties, demonstrate their own abilities, use their performance to show the value and dignity of the examination system, and use their performance to eliminate the criticism of others and strive for legal protection.

(B) There must be a spirit of learning: Comrades who pass the examination, except for those who are older and more experienced, do have insufficient experience and inevitably suffer criticism from society. But talent is developed through experience, and experience is accumulated. There is no one in the world who is born with experience. As long as you are willing to be humble, you are willing to learn, and you can persevere and persist, then no matter how big or small the matter is, there will be a day when you will be proficient in it.

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated the "institutional school" movement, which is to impart education in work, so that some young civil servants can learn from experienced superiors and colleagues. Therefore, I hope that comrades who pass the examination will always maintain a humble attitude and a spirit of learning. With this spirit of learning, we will not be "complacent" and will be able to make constant progress.

(C) There must be a concept of national scholars: The national scholars referred to here are different from the national scholars advocated by Yu Rang in the past. Yu Rang said, "When Zhongxing treats me like an ordinary person, I will repay him like an ordinary person; when Zhibo treats me like a national scholar, I will repay him like a national scholar." That is only out of a selfish thought, targeting only the individual, not the country. I believe that the meaning of a national scholar should be that those who are capable of governing the country can be called national scholars; at the same time, national scholars must be loyal to the country and know only the public and not the private in everything, in order to be worthy of the name. Comrades who pass the examination are the talents selected by the country, and they should not fail to be those who are capable of governing the country. Therefore, they must develop a patriotic and national salvation enthusiasm, do their best to repay the country, and be "public and just" to everyone and everything. Absolutely do not use public office for private gain or favor one over another because of personal grievances, local interests, temporary likes and dislikes, and praise and criticism. I hope that comrades who pass the examination can take the lead in cultivating this new concept of national scholars, to persuade those who value party and personal interests.

At this time when the country is actively building and needs talent, and also at the time when the Annual Meeting of the Examination and Political Science Association is held, I am only offering my foolishness as a humble gift. (September 12, 1946, in Nanjing)

Female Refugee Student Appeals for Educational Aid

Editor: I am one of the young students who fled from northern Jiangsu (a graduate of the Second Temporary Middle School). I am currently seeking an education, but I cannot fulfill my wishes due to economic reasons. I read in the newspaper that the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association had 100 million yuan to distribute to refugee students from northern Jiangsu. This reignited my hopes of returning to school. I immediately sent a letter to the association, asking for assistance, and attached my refugee registration number to prove that I was indeed a refugee student. Unexpectedly, after the letter was sent, it disappeared without a trace. I have been admitted to the first year of high school at the private Peiming Girls' High School. The school fees are very expensive, and my family really cannot afford it. What I am looking forward to is waiting for the relief association to give me a sum of relief money. The relief money obtained from various fundraising methods in Shanghai is more than 100 million yuan, but it cannot help the refugee students from northern Jiangsu, which I deeply regret! There are many refugee students from northern Jiangsu who are in the same situation as me. In line with the principle of cultivating talents for a hundred years, I respectfully appeal to the authorities to allocate some of this huge sum of money for the relief of refugee students from northern Jiangsu to students who are homeless and have been admitted to school but cannot attend. In that case, I will be grateful for the rest of my life. I also pray that a comprehensive investigation will be conducted to avoid omissions, which would be even more grateful. (Ji Yu)

Please Establish an Engineering Night School

Editor: After reading your newspaper's editorial on the 18th, on the one hand, I feel very admired, and on the other hand, it sparked my thoughts.

I am a high school graduate. After graduation, due to economic and other reasons, I had to give up my wish to continue my studies and enter the workforce. For the past two years, I have used my spare time to read some science magazines and review my old math and science textbooks. I have even completed a calculus textbook on my own. But this self-study, which requires twice the effort for half the results, cannot satisfy my thirst for knowledge. So I thought of a work-study program. But I was very disappointed. Among the existing universities, only Soochow University has a night school for the business school, and there is also an industrial night school, which enrolls students once every two months. The rest are cram schools and the like. There is no proper engineering night school. I believe that in this city, there must be many young people who are interested in industry and who are living the same life as me, wanting to satisfy their thirst for knowledge but unable to, and are waiting for the emergence of an engineering night university. (Like the former Lester Industrial Vocational School night school) (Zhang Linyi)

Iron Factory Apprentices Cannot Afford Medical Treatment

Editor: I am a little apprentice in an iron factory. On the afternoon of the 6th, I accidentally broke my finger. I immediately went to the "Labor Hospital" for treatment. Unexpectedly, the staff at the registration office wanted a registration fee of 2,000 yuan, which is half a month's salary for me, and I don't even know where to get the money for food? So I went back to the factory and let it heal naturally. I remember seeing a plaque inside that said "Benefit Our Laborers" when I treated my foot last time. I think we should do this "benefit" in the future! (Little Apprentice)

Ginling Women's University Enrollment Did Not Show Favoritism

Ginling Women's College of Arts and Sciences Admissions Committee Letter (excerpt) The school's enrollment is always fair, and there is no favoritism or lobbying. In this enrollment in Shanghai, more than 30,000 people applied, and only more than 60 regular students and more than 20 alternate students were admitted. Due to the limited number of places, those who failed were inevitably resentful. Also, a total of six students from Jinde Girls' High School applied, and only one was admitted, which shows that there was no preferential treatment for Jinde students. Even graduates of the school's affiliated high school must participate in the same entrance examination and receive no special treatment. These facts are known to all, so what the contributor said is not true. (Omitted below)

Can I Get Into a Metropolitan Hospital?

Editor: I just came to Shanghai from Qingdao. Because my child suffers from a mental illness, I was introduced to Dr. Wang by a friend. I went to a hospital on Fumin Road last night and took my child out of the hospital this afternoon. In fact, I was only in the hospital for one day, but I was charged for two days, for a total of 110,000 yuan. When I went to the hospital yesterday, I paid 50,000 yuan, which was reduced by 40,000 yuan, and I still owed more than 20,000 yuan. I had to exchange my only gold ring to pay it off before I could leave the hospital. Looking back at my child, his condition is still the same as yesterday, and has not been reduced by a fraction. Alas! The hospitals of the big city, the doctors of the big city, the medical ethics of the big hospitals and big doctors! (Wang Qi)

The Hospital Service Department Charges Too Much

Editor: Because I am weak and often sick, I went to the Sino-American Hospital on the 30th of last month to check my physical condition, which cost 30,000 yuan. I heard that the hospital has a social service department, which specializes in serving the poor, but the fees are so expensive, which is inevitably contrary to the purpose of service. (Lin Feng'an)

In response to a letter from reader Huang Gongquan inquiring about the remittance fee between Shanghai and Yangzhou, which was forwarded by your newspaper on August 2, we hereby inform you that the domestic money order rate of this bureau is based on the money order announcement of the Shanghai Postal Administration. The additional remittance rate for Jiangdu money orders is also based on the Jiangsu Postal Administration's quick mail telegram No. 405 of July 4 and the Shanghai Postal Administration's money order announcement No. 249 of July 6, adding 150 per thousand for special group water supplement fee and 10 per yuan for ordinary group water supplement fee (including 5 cents for the previous water supplement fee, totaling 15 cents). We hereby send this letter for your reference and publication. Sincerely, Shanghai Branch of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau

### Reader Reply: Legal Inquiries

(1) Forced Property Transfer

Zhao Kaijia asks: In the 28th year (of the Republic), a certain Mr. Jia opened a travel agency in a certain place, acting as manager. Later, a certain Mr. Yi, coveting the agency, colluded with the enemy's constable to arrest Mr. Jia, falsely accusing him of contacting Central Government personnel with the intent to frame him. After much mediation by others, Mr. Yi declared that he would only release Mr. Jia on the condition that he take over the travel agency. Mr. Jia reluctantly agreed to the transfer. After the victory (of the war), Mr. Yi fled without a trace, and the county government sealed up the travel agency. Recently, Mr. Yi has been using his corrupt influence to lobby the county government to lift the seal. It is said that the county government has already approved the request. Although Mr. Jia has filed a lawsuit based on reason, it has been ineffective. I would like to ask: (1) What kind of procedures should be used to recover the original property from Mr. Yi? (2) Can this case be directly negotiated with Mr. Yi? (3) The only evidence currently available is the account books from the 28th year to the 32nd year. The share certificates and other documents have been seized by Mr. Yi. Will this have any impact on future litigation?

[Lawyer Qin Liankui answers:] If Mr. Jia's travel agency was indeed subject to Mr. Yi's collusion with the enemy's constable to arrest Mr. Jia with the intent to harm him, and Mr. Yi declared that he would only release Mr. Jia on the condition of taking over the travel agency, and Mr. Jia reluctantly agreed to the transfer, then Mr. Jia's expression of transfer was due to coercion. According to Article 92 of the Civil Code, Mr. Jia may revoke his expression. However, Article 93 of the Civil Code stipulates that the revocation mentioned in the previous article must be made within one year after discovering the fraud or the termination of the coercion. Furthermore, Article 7 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation states that if the period for exercising rights stipulated in the Civil Code or local laws cannot be observed due to war, the rights may still be exercised within two years after the implementation of these regulations. However, if the original stipulated period is shorter than two years, it may only be exercised within six months after the implementation of these regulations. This supplementary regulation was promulgated and implemented on December 18, 1945, and expired on June 18 of this year. However, if the county government's sealing was based on Mr. Jia's lawsuit against Mr. Yi, and it occurred before June 18 of this year, then it can be considered that Mr. Jia has already taken action to revoke. Now, I will answer the listed questions separately as follows: (1) Lawsuits or negotiation procedures can be used within the statutory period. (2) The revocation in Article 92 of the Civil Code originally involves direct negotiation, but it should be done within the statutory period. (3) The emphasis of the evidence is on proving coercion.

(2) Mortgage Loan

Hong Dongling asks: In the 25th year (of the Republic), a relative of mine borrowed money from my mother because he had no capital to start a business. Since there was no cash on hand, he mortgaged a house, an inheritance from my late father, to a certain Mr. Jia for 700 yuan. It was agreed that the term would be three years, and Mr. Jia would be free to dispose of the property after the term expired. From that day on, Mr. Jia would collect rent to offset the interest. The agreement was signed by my mother and my wife, and my father-in-law was the guarantor. It was not signed or agreed to by me. Now, my mother and wife have passed away one after another. I would like to ask: (1) Is the agreement still valid? (2) In order to comply with my mother's will, I intend to repay 200 times the amount, but Mr. Jia insists on 500 times. I don't know if this deed can be reported lost to the Land Administration Bureau and denied. (3) If the agreement is legal, what are the redemption procedures?

[Lawyer Qin Liankui answers:] (1) A mother who mortgages the real estate inherited from her late father by her adult son, or the real estate inherited from her late father jointly inherited with her son, without the son's consent, the adult son can deny the mortgage. However, the son should be responsible for paying off the debt borrowed by the mother after her death. (2) The increased payment for repaying debts is currently subject to fair assessment by the court, and there are no other standards. In order to avoid the tightness of litigation, it seems better to settle amicably. Regarding the recovery of the deed, if a settlement cannot be reached, it can be handled concurrently when suing to deny the mortgage. If it is falsely claimed that it is lost, it will be inconsistent with the facts. As for whether or not to donate to charity, it is also irrelevant to the recovery of the deed. (3) Refer to the answers in (1) and (2) for clarification.

### Drama Education

— Xiang Peiliang

Because dramatic performance itself already possesses a certain educational significance, drama education has been misunderstood. It is believed that as long as the content or theme of the play performed contains moral implications, it can be called educational drama. In fact, this view is not sufficient to correctly explain the meaning of drama education.

This statement refers to the effect of dramatic performance on the audience (i.e., art connoisseurs). Thus, this performance must be a mature artistic activity, and therefore the drama performances of students and children will be rejected. In fact, the most active field of art education is primary and secondary schools. Secondly, strictly speaking, any work of art is moral, especially drama. Therefore, works like Oedipus Rex, Camille, and Salome are all moral, let alone others. Of course, we can call those with clear moral consciousness educational drama, but this is not the main part of drama education.

Music, fine arts, and other arts in art education all educate children from the art activity itself (creation). Therefore, drama education must also educate children from the drama activity itself. The entire process of a performance includes a wide range of activities, simply a concrete representation of the entire life and society. Therefore, the scope of drama education is extremely broad. Also, because the movement of the human body is the most basic activity, its influence on the mind is extremely deep; therefore, the effectiveness of drama education will be extremely great.

Now, I will explain drama education as follows: Drama education is a type of art education. Its scope of activity is mainly in primary and secondary schools, targeting youth and children. Drama education teaches through dramatic activities (mainly performance), which is also a creative behavior. As for the method of educating viewers through acting, although it is also a part of drama education, it is not an important object of research in today's drama education because it has been practiced for a long time both in China and abroad.

### Love Bravely! Reading "Romeo and Juliet"

— Tao Xiong

The great Shakespeare left us "Romeo and Juliet". Let us know: "Youth is easy to pass away" and "The sacredness, sublimity, and greatness of love".

This pair of characters representing youth and love; Romeo and Juliet. Although hatred and obstacles are in front of them, they cannot stop their union.

Pure love always follows youth. Only with lofty feelings and pure hearts can one obtain true love.

In a person's life, youth only occupies a few short years. When Cupid's forehead is revealed, don't hide!

Romeo and Juliet. They ignore the hatred between the two families, the obstacles in front of them, and the sadness of the future; they tightly grasp youth and love boldly. They are the ones who truly understand life!

What is hateful are the stubborn parents, forcing their children to marry someone who is not loved. These stubborn parents have killed the youth and lives of many lovely young people. They have destroyed the love of many lovers and trampled on the wills of many lovers! Until now, this unreasonable demand still exists. Children with wavering wills and weak personalities are still acting as lambs on the altar! Young people should be liberated from the altar! Resist stubborn parents! Eliminate the remnants of feudalism, escape from the cage, and go to the free world! Think about the happiness of the future.

If it weren't for Old Capulet forcing the lovely Juliet, why would she have to use death to conceal her unwillingness! If it weren't for Old Capulet seizing Juliet's will, how could he have caused this pair of lovely youth figures to burn in the flames of love!

A person, from the moment they are born, has already decided their fate as a slave! As long as they are human, they cannot escape this cruel decision. They cannot live like a master, unaffected by anything, unconstrained by anything, uncontrolled by anything. They will obey their own fate like a slave! These slaves with different fates! When you have no love, what else do you cherish in this world?

God created mankind: giving life and love; if God takes back love and only leaves life to people, there will be no warmth in human life. What difference is there between this and a moving clay sculpture!

When you have no love, or your love is rejected, you will feel that life is uninteresting and disappointed in the future! You will hate, hate yourself for why you were born into this world!

Since there has been culture, many great writers and artists have been depicting love in the world! Until now, it has never been interrupted. Shakespeare's greatest work, "Romeo and Juliet", not only tells us about the sacredness and sublimity of love, but also tells us: Youth is so easy to pass away.

Young Romeos and Juliets, hold on tightly to your youth, don't let it slip away stealthily! When Cupid descends, love bravely! Don't let down the life and love that God has given you!

### Subei Dialect

— Yu

The Subei Fellow Association believes that the use of Subei dialect by the petty traitor in "Home of Loyalty and Righteousness" is deliberately insulting to Subei compatriots. In fact, you can't deny that he is Chinese because he speaks the dialect of that place. If it caused protests from Chinese compatriots because he spoke Chinese.

This makes it too difficult for art workers.

New singers Keiser Grelson and Hailin in the film "Seven Affections Flower"

### Seven Affections Flower

— Lin

Pastner is the film producer who created Diana Duping. Almost every one of Diana's singing films is his masterpiece. Now he has joined MGM. "Seven Affections Flower" is the first film he produced at MGM.

"Seven Affections Flower" is a musical film about seven sisters running an inn in a small town in Michigan, USA – seven beautiful Misses. The village has always preserved the customs left by Dutch immigrants and holds the annual Tulip Festival.

Katherine Grayson is the youngest daughter of the innkeeper. In the season of flowers all over the fields, she falls in love with a reporter who comes to cover the flower festival news. The story is simple and gentle, without shocking or dangerous scenes, and without sad or melancholic atmosphere. It is just a faint human touch, mixed with a faint smile, and the beautiful rural background dotted with Grayson's soft songs.

Grayson has an extremely melodious and beautiful singing voice (and is of course very beautiful). According to the miss, after signing a contract with MGM, she received very strict vocal training, and also learned other arts such as makeup, beauty, and expression. Therefore, Grayson represents a new group in Hollywood, the so-called "stars of tomorrow" who have received new specialized training.

Therefore, we can boldly say: Pastner is creating a second Diana Duping.

### Makeup and Color

— Wenquan

Makeup is a necessary procedure and work in completing the external expression of an actor's role. It is one of the earliest assumptions and earliest completed creations in the actor's entire artistic creation process. In any performance situation, it must fully achieve its purpose. Under the highly sophisticated lighting and color usage in modern theaters, makeup must also be meticulously implemented with complete materials. Conversely, if performing in rural squares and open-air theaters, the makeup method should be changed to a simple and exaggerated technique. The use of masks in ancient Greek and Roman dramas was also an extreme exaggeration to meet the needs of a large audience.

In the actor's art, makeup is a static part of the character's stage image. Its expression is non-instantaneous and discontinuous. And its change must be completed during the intermission. Therefore, it must be handled with the knowledge of using invariance to respond to change, and it can coordinate the unity and vividness of various colors of light and emotions.

In addition to the above-mentioned differences from acting, the materials of makeup are also taken from outside the actor himself. Therefore, it is often ignored by general actors as not belonging to a part of their own art. At the same time, in order to value their own distorted star identity, they often ask the makeup manager to do the makeup for them (if it is just asking for technical help in a certain part, it is another matter). I ask, for the role you are most familiar with, do you want others to give you the appearance? Can this fact of disharmony of body and mind promote the completion of your art?

Although the expression result of makeup contains the technical factors of the implementer, this technique must never become a mechanical and formulaic habit. The requirements of modern drama makeup are just like the script is taken from a wide range of life—various races, classes, and different knowledge, different ages, and different personalities. At the same time, the realistic components must be increased or decreased according to the performance type of each play. For example, in Chinese abstract old dramas, if you abolish the mask and replace it with realistic makeup, it will also destroy its unity. Conversely, applying it to all dramas will become neither donkey nor horse, and will not become art.

All colors originate from light. As mentioned repeatedly before, the manifestation of light and color and dyeing, as well as the contrast between colors, have also been described separately. Therefore, the equipment of various colored lights in a complete makeup room also requires actors to have a very correct understanding of color science. There is a detailed record of the use of stage colors in each play. Then, using this detailed record in conjunction with colored oil paint for makeup can give the audience the correct effect. In other words: "Colored oil paint matched with prepared stage colors is the true makeup color." Using this color for makeup can achieve the correct effect.

### About Spring Cold

— Liu Yu

The theme of the play "Spring Cold," recently staged at the Lyceum Theatre, is exactly the same as Ibsen's "An Enemy of the People." The protagonist of "Spring Cold," the old doctor, is a person who bravely stands up, regardless of all the obstacles of social evil forces, and calls for justice and seeks happiness for the public everywhere. For the sake of public health, he carried out the water storage tank water work. He spared no effort, not for personal gain. Even when he was so lonely that he could almost collapse, he still straightened his chest, determined to implement his own proposition and realize his ideals. Anyone can change their course after experiencing countless setbacks and turn with the wind, but this old doctor is not shaken by any evil forces. He even gritted his teeth at the end and announced the secret to his battle with the evil forces: "Hit them in their vital points!"

Ibsen's "An Enemy of the People" also describes the problem of Yonghe bacteria; in "An Enemy of the People," he also created a fighting character who fights against social evil forces.

Therefore, we cannot help but say that the author of "Spring Cold" was influenced by Ibsen. But Ibsen's "An Enemy of the People" was published in 1882, while the birth of "Spring Cold" was more than half a century later. From this, it can be seen that a great masterpiece has permanent value because it can discover and refine the laws of truth—this law of truth is the theme of literary and artistic creation, and it is also the substance and bones of a work.

### A Week of Film Reviews

— Zhu Xi

The box office situation of this week's films is still the same as last week: "Bathing Beauty" and the domestic film "Home of Loyalty and Righteousness" are the best. Four shows a day, every show is full.

Bathing Beauty

The film has a good opening. Red Skelton is much more lively than Esther Williams. The film's editing is not as good as the direction, and the direction is not as good as the acting.

Destination Tokyo

The theme is serious. John Garfield's landing work is not outstanding, which is the failure of the play. The removal of the time bomb is very good.

The Doughgirls

According to the plot, the director should be able to please the audience, but the result is a failure, so there are several places that should be very pleasing but lack a breath. The ending is an example.

The scene of killing Linda Darnell is very clean.

Linda Darnell doesn't have many scenes, and because this type of role is easy to please, it can't be said to be successful. The protagonist, Wright Krieger, is only competent and above. George Sanders' character is not written well enough, and the acting is too simple.

Lady on a Train

The director introduces Deanna Durbin with a three-part sequence of the car, the station, and calling the police, which is not bad. The scene where the villain steals back the sleeping shoes has excellent camera work. The camera moves out from beside Deanna while she is singing, circles the garden, and goes to the villain's back outdoors. Although Deanna is not seen in this scene, she is the center of it.

Can't Help Singing

Although the story belongs to a farce, it lacks rigor; the character Dorothy Lamour in the latter part does not seem to have a good connection with the previous part. The overall performance of the film is not as good as the previously screened "They Got Me Covered."

Bob Hope is still very lively, while Dorothy Lamour is rigid. If you only have one purpose—to relieve boredom—then it is still a good film.

Actors

(1) Red Skelton, in "Bathing Beauty"

(2) Edward Everett Horton, in "Lady on a Train"

(3) Wright Krieger, in "The Doughgirls"

### Gu Zhongyi Lectures on Dramatic Structure

— Chen Mo

Structure is the soul of drama. Structure is to use economical means and clever methods to grasp the audience, not letting them have a single moment of relaxation until the end. The structure of drama is a very strict organizational method. A part of the structure depends on talent, and a part also depends on training. To talk about the structure of drama, the first thing to study is the center of drama. The center of drama is not in the characters but in the actions. There is no irrelevant person, no irrelevant thing, and no irrelevant word in the drama. A drama without a climax is a flat drama.

The structure of a play is mainly divided into three parts: beginning, development, and ending. The opening of any play must attract the audience's attention, curiosity, suspicion, sympathy, or disgust, and there should also be foreshadowing. Development is based on the facts presented in the opening. The main effect of the play is in this scene. To make the actions in the lining drama fully and concretely expressed, and at the same time maintain the audience's interest, the actions in that tragedy must be developed in a complex and intricate way, and displayed in continuous crises. Crisis is the focus of emotions in the development of a play, that is, those situations that contain an emotional conflict. The ending of the play first seeks clarity. The audience must not have any doubts. The development of the actions in the play, and the psychology of the audience, should be reasonable. But the ending should not be too hasty.

Aristotle said: "Structure includes three points: (1) The length of the play. The play should not be too long or too short. Within a period of time, the whole play should be performed perfectly. The time is two to three hours. (2) Structure: Divided into three points: A beginning, B middle, C ending. The beginning must cause the occurrence of complex situations. Development must rely on the continuous display of the law of cause and effect. The ending is the summary of the whole play. And the most feared in the causal relationship are two points: (1) coincidence, (2) irrelevance.

The structure of drama from Greece to the present is divided into two major schools: (1) The classical school method. Emphasizing the unity of the three unities: time, place, and action. (2) The romantic school method. Ignoring all restrictions.

The classical school relies on integrity, compactness, and unified atmosphere. The disadvantage is that the scope is too small; it is easy to be far-fetched, artificial, and the development of the character's personality is greatly restricted, or even no development.

The romantic school selects dramatic scenes with a large scope, richer content, and the characters have the opportunity to develop as much as possible. The disadvantage is that the structure is easy to loosen, not compact enough, and there is no complete atmosphere and emotion.

These two methods have their own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the subject matter and the author's interest to decide the choice of method.

The ordinary classical school uses Greek tragedy as a blueprint, and the romantic school uses Shakespeare's plays as a demonstration.

In the structure of drama, using two methods is the most effective and can best grasp the audience's emotions until the end of the play.

One is "expectation". That is, the most important crisis or the main trend of action in the play, like waves, one wave after another, makes the audience's emotions roll into the flood tide of the plot, and an expectant heart expects how this crisis will be resolved, how it will end, until the end of the play, the problem that the audience expects is finally understood.

The second is "opposite". The crisis is coming, discovered by the audience, but the people in the play do not know it. The result of the play is the opposite of what the audience hopes. The people in the play do not know that they are taking the wrong path, approaching failure and death step by step, until they clearly recognize their situation, but it is irreparable. But his crisis is always seen very clearly by the audience, and they deeply worry about him, expect him, but watch him taking the opposite path from what the audience hopes until he is destroyed!

Spring and Autumn

### Inventions and Creations

— Xu Shiqi

Scientific inventions and artistic creations bring material and spiritual happiness to humanity, exuding the noble meaning of truth, goodness, and beauty in life. William Harvey's old theory from 1300 years ago established the most glorious record in the 17th-century history of medicine.

The genius writer Leonardo da Vinci, based on anatomical research, proved 450 years ago that humans could also use scientific methods to soar in the sky like birds. At the time, he was subjected to people's criticism and ridicule. Fortunately, relying on his outstanding talent for painting, he completed the masterpieces "Mona Lisa" and "The Last Supper," which overshadowed his achievements in science and medicine.

Yun Shouping and Wang Shigu were equally famous in their time. Yun was ashamed to be second in China, abandoning landscapes and specializing in flowers and birds, bringing a unique brilliance to the Eastern art world. Shi Tao commented, "Before the ancients established laws, we do not know which laws they followed. After the ancients established laws, we do not allow modern people to go beyond the ancient laws. For thousands of years, this has made modern people unable to stand out. How unjust!" This spirit of creation is the essence of an artist.

Confucius said politely, "Transmitting, not creating, believing in and loving antiquity." This was misunderstood by lazy countrymen, who used imitation to replace invention and creation, affecting the progress of Chinese scholarship as a whole.

Fascism has fallen, and Germany and Italy have collapsed. Back then, Hitler discriminated against Jews, and Professor Einstein has since been hired by the United States to teach at the highest institution of learning.

Science and art that create peace and happiness are not controlled by time and space. They transcend any era and nation, and they want to infuse new blood, permeating the hearts of all mankind.

### Exploring "Shi Tao's Sayings on Painting" (Part 2)

— Zheng Wei

From these few paragraphs, we know that Shi Tao's "brush and ink" came from "accepting responsibility." This theory of accepting responsibility is like the corresponding, non-action doctrine of Lao Tzu and Zhuangzi. As long as he emphasizes the depth of brush and ink, the flexibility of the wrist, and the emptiness and wonder, it comes from "intelligence and detachment" (that is, Lao Tzu's emptying the mind, filling the belly, weakening the will, and strengthening the bones), to embody the ultimate principle of "non-action yet action, non-transformation yet responding to transformation." Only in this way can one fully utilize brush and ink and fulfill the entire responsibility of the day. Achieving "accepting things without form, fitting forms without a trace," "moving peaks as if already formed, wielding the brush as if non-acting, a small piece of paper containing heaven and earth, mountains, rivers, and all things, while the heart is indifferent." It is also the true meaning of Zhuangzi's Cook Ding dissecting an ox and the craftsman of Ying wielding an axe. As Lao Tzu said, "One who travels well leaves no tracks." In fact, these are all rules, the most brilliant laws. So if we say that Shi Tao has laws and rules, then it should belong to this category. In fact, an artist who can be admired by all living beings must be someone who best understands the "laws" and "rules" of life.

"How to obtain this law" and "rules"? This requires talking about "the One Stroke," which also involves the question of the origin of Shi Tao's artistic conception. To understand the One Stroke, we must first talk about its source. Turning to the first chapter of "Sayings on Painting":

"In ancient times, there was no law, and the primordial simplicity was not dispersed. Once the primordial simplicity was dispersed, laws were established. Where are the laws established? Established in the One Stroke. The One Stroke is the origin of all beings and the root of all phenomena."

These few words can summarize the birth of Shi Tao's artistic conception, and also the origin of the universe and all things. This, of course, should be said to be Shi Tao's own mind taking in the universe. But I also want to say that he borrowed a huge background: the Taoist thought, representing Eastern nourishment, to assist in its incubation. Lao Tzu, Chapter 28:

"When the uncarved block is split, it is made into implements." And Chapter 42:

"The Tao produces one, one produces two, two produces three, and three produces all things."

The uncarved block is complete, but it is not without use. If there is use, there must also be a distributing function. Therefore, it is dispersed and made into implements (implements refer to use, which is what Lao Tzu called "one produces two," where "one" refers to this inherent "sameness," the master that the equator reaches and returns to). "The Doctrine of the Mean": "Because it is unique and not twofold, it produces things unfathomably" (responding to this and achieving mutual benefit, hence the sage holds to one and becomes the model for the world). From this, we can know the importance of this "one," this "sameness," in the universe. "Understanding the One" is to use it to discover all "differences." Shi has a deep understanding of this, but because his position is in painting, he uses the "clarity" of the "One Stroke" to understand all "differences," achieving the "transformation" of the One Stroke. Furthermore, the chapter on Entrusting Responsibility says:

"Responsibility does not lie in breadth, but in controlling what is possible."

"Controlling" means regulating. Inheriting clarity from sameness all originates in his complete and undivided worldview. Although the principle of the One Stroke lies in the complete uncarved block, the method of the One Stroke is "hidden in use by man." This is what was mentioned above, how Shi Tao discovered a "self," what a brilliant awakening. The "self" comes from sympathy for things. (Indian scientist Tagore's 1926 article on the meaning of art, given at the Deccan School in Bengal, India, also expounds this idea). The "self" is only an individual, but to express the complete mystery of the universe, it cannot be done without the individual. Shi Tao was able to discover the "self" in the existence of all things, understand the existence of all things from the existence of the individual "self," and meet the "sameness" in their reality, achieving the wonderful use of the One Stroke (the gate of all wonders), thereby connecting all uses. The chapter on the One Stroke:

"Traveling far and climbing high all starts from a small patch. The One Stroke encompasses everything beyond the primordial chaos. Even billions of brushstrokes all start from this and originate from this."

Only by enriching the completeness of the individual can there be a mutual and related effect with billions of brushstrokes (using use to achieve essence). Shi Tao calls it all laws returning to one. Therefore, the chapter on Honoring and Accepting Responsibility:

"The One Stroke contains all things within it, fully receiving ink. Ink receives the brush, the brush receives the wrist, and the wrist receives the heart, like the creation of heaven and the completion of earth. This is why it is received." The chapter on Combining:

"Exhausting the One means seeing the roots of the past masters." The chapter on Mountains and Rivers:

"From one to ten thousand, from ten thousand to one, transforming one into a complete whole, all the great accomplishments in the world are completed." Conversely, the chapter on Mountains and Rivers:

"If one is not clear, then all things are obscure. If one is completely clear, then all things are orderly." The chapter on Understanding the Law:

"From the heart" can enter the realm of "non-action and transformation." Because there is no action, there is no failure; because there is no attachment, there is no loss (Lao Tzu's words). Without failure and without attachment, one becomes one with heaven, and the artwork becomes a "collaboration between heaven and man." Being able to accept responsibility, understand the accumulation of nurturing life, understand the laws of reality from nurturing life (the meaning of the rotation of heaven and earth), understand the universe of transporting simplicity from the laws of the One Stroke (the effort of governing ten thousand with two), reaching the realm of harmony between heaven and man. Then, one can understand Shi Tao clearly in mind and vision, and it can be said that one has thought halfway through the philosophy of Confucianism and Taoism for thousands of years.

Here, the author wants to use two passages of his own to annotate Shi Tao. The chapter on the Seashore:

"The sea has great waves, and the mountains have hidden depths. The sea has swallowing and spitting, and the mountains have arching and bowing. The sea can entrust spirit, and the mountains can carry pulse. The mountains have layers of peaks and ranges, deep valleys and steep cliffs, towering and protruding, with mist and dew in the air, and clouds arriving, just like the great torrent of the sea and the swallowing and spitting of the sea. This is not just the sea entrusting spirit, but also the mountains residing in the sea. Even chess and astral distribution can be used to infer the source of water and the dragon's pulse. If one gains from the sea but loses from the mountains, or gains from the mountains but loses from the sea, then one must be subject to it. My reception is that the mountain is the sea, and the sea is the mountain. Knowing me through mountains and seas is all in the elegant demeanor of a person's brush and ink."

Nature is a great torrent, and Shi Tao is a hidden energy. Nature swallows and spits, and Shi Tao has the ability to arch and bow to it (accepting responsibility). Nature entrusts spirit to Shi Tao, and Shi Tao's dragon pulse is connected (inheriting nurturing life). These spirits of nature, Shi Tao's many secluded emotions and magnificent colors on the painting, are not just based on the entrusting of nature's spirit, but are Shi Tao and nature's spirits mutually blending. Shi Tao himself believes that he is nature, so although Shi Tao and all things can be divided, they are intimately connected in responding to spirit and connecting pulse. If we can explore the spirits of all things, we can also find where Shi Tao's bloodline is. If one obtains all the laws but loses Shi Tao, or obtains Shi Tao but loses all the laws, then it is to be subject to it for the person seeking to excavate this artist. True understanding is to see the complete and non-dual in Shi Tao and all laws, and the reason why the author dares to say so is because in the "elegant demeanor" that the master left us in brush and ink, this is what is called "Shi Tao." In the chapter on Mountains and Rivers:

"This is me fifty years ago, not yet separated from the mountains and rivers. It is also not discarding the essence of the mountains and rivers and making the mountains and rivers selfish. The mountains and rivers make me speak on behalf of the mountains and rivers. The mountains and rivers are born from me, and I am born from the mountains and rivers, searching all the strange peaks to make drafts. The mountains and rivers and I meet in spirit and transform in form, so in the end, it all returns to Dadizi."

Only in the realm of forgetting both self and things is the complete and natural value of the universe revealed—this is what is called "Dadizi."

### Interlude

— Zi Rong

——Artistic Terms Series 5——

The English term is "Interlude." During the reign of Queen Elizabeth in England, the playwright John Heywood began to create a type of short play that could be performed in a short time as entertainment during banquets, etc., and it was named "Interlude."

### Problem Novels · Problem Plays

——Artistic Terms Series 6——

This is a tendency that arose in modern literature and art. Novels that use social problems, moral problems, religious problems, women's problems, etc., arising in modern life as topics are called problem novels. When this tendency is expressed in scripts, it is called problem plays. Ibsen's plays are good examples of problem plays.

### Every Inch of Mountain and River, Every Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng 33

[Previous Summary—During the eight years of the War of Resistance, millions of heroic Chinese sons and daughters in the front lines, the rear, and the occupied areas shed their bright red blood across every inch of the motherland to defend it. We have collected these tragic stories to commemorate the hardships of recovering lost territories.

The first story—“Seven Secret Documents”—records how the Japanese pirates colluded with several war demons in Europe, and made seven secret documents to ravage the world, to destroy all culture.

Young He Xiong Wang, from the cradle to the graduation of the Army University, received "aggression education." Perhaps due to pure blood, he was full of a sense of justice, and could not stand the broken style of Japanese pirates and warlords—rape, plunder, arson, murder, gambling, drug trafficking, extortion, all kinds of criminal behavior. Just as he was starting to feel disgusted, he accidentally discovered that he himself was a direct descendant of Mr. Gu Jihan, an old Tongmenghui comrade. At the same time, he heard about the content of the "Seven Secret Documents" and tried to expose them to save this disaster of widespread suffering.

He only had one pain—he found that he was in love with Ji Yaoqun, a beautiful and outstanding daughter of the Northeast. Fearing that he would fall into the trap of love and delay the great plan, he rushed into the tiger's den to find the "Seven Secret Documents" with a determination to die, but entrusted his close friend Yue Jun—a freelance writer—to act as the secret radio station of Changxindian, and also asked Yue Jun to introduce Yaoqun to Mr. W, the director of the East District counter-espionage organization, to participate in the work of eliminating traitors.

Yaoqun was also able to understand He Jian's painstaking efforts, so she stayed up all night with Little Tiger—a thirteen-year-old martial arts expert from the north—to complete the procedures for joining the ranks, and hurriedly embarked on the journey to work in Tongzhou.

Yue Jun went to Beiping, completed Yaoqun's affairs, and immediately prepared to work at the Changxindian regiment. At this time, it was after "July 7th," and the Wanping battle was about to break out. What lay before him was a cruel "death line"...]

### Galloping Horse

— Written by Zhang Yizun

### Lonely Riverside at Dusk

— Song Ling

"The sunset is infinitely good"—It is nearly dusk in early autumn! The rolling waves, green then yellow, yellow then green.

The edge of the island gradually entered the line of sight from afar. Where the cargo ship passed, a large yellow scar was suddenly cut open on the vast expanse of misty waves. In the air, the whistle spewed out several circles of fantastic patterns, telling people that there would be another docking soon.

Thousands of lives, thousands of hopes, and thousands of translations, began to stir slightly. In the ocean, the empty worries given to this small, millet-like boat were once again filled with existence.

For those from the mountains who have just experienced sea travel, the dock should have a special warmth.

When the sunset left only half of its face at the intersection of the sky and water, the ship had already berthed at the wharf; although the wind was still timidly brushing the sea, it was no longer hot and irritable inside.

A brewing human flow erupted like a surging torrent.

Passengers, goods, money... another exchange.

A swarm of hawkers tore their throats and shouted unfamiliar sound waves. There were old men, little girls, and young men; one basket, three cages, one basin to carry; some holding, some carrying on their heads, on the deck, on the shore... the same trembling voices, the same sallow faces, tattered clothes, and a pair of eyes shining with hazy, longing light.

A carrying pole, two circles of hemp rope, bare-chested coolies, spinning rapidly in the crowd, humming powerful primitive songs in the cargo hold.

The world is full of sounds, noisy, lively...

Strength is flowing everywhere...

In the west, faintly, the sunset intentionally or unintentionally painted the dim dusk with obscure colors.

A military card sped through the crowd to the dock, another frantic commotion; suddenly a sharp cry of a girl rang out! A basket of tea eggs was thrown far away with force... and on the other side, in front of that open-air food stall, someone seemed to be beating fiercely...

The sound, the sound of people, spread out from here and was transmitted from elsewhere. Mixed, whole, continuous, the urban atmosphere was noisy, and it was impossible to distinguish whether it was joy, anger, sadness, happiness, resentment, sighing, or elation.

It should be lively, powerful, or majestic! But isn't it also withered, lonely, and desolate!

The mysteries of life are not easy to explain seriously. From this base to another foothold, who is not experiencing hope, desire, waiting, drifting, struggling...

The ship floated on another, even more distant voyage, a large, yellow dragon-like footprint stretching endlessly forward...

Thousands of beautiful expectations are sailing and swaying.

The water dock faded from blurry to disappearing!

It should be the same! At this time, time has fallen from chaos and noise back into silence, silently watching the sun mixed with people and sea water sweep the aftermath.

Chapter 4 On the Death Line

The next morning, before dawn, Yaoqun and Little Tiger, carrying the secret order from the Action Headquarters, hurriedly embarked on their journey to work in Tongzhou. Thanks to Mr. W's kindness, he repeatedly insisted on me staying in Beiping for a day, on the one hand, to do his best as a host, and on the other hand, to take this opportunity to discuss some ways of future cooperation.

From Mr. W's conversation that day, I got a few reports on the national situation; but compared with the information we got from Changxindian, it seemed to be slightly different. I think the following few points are more important, now written behind, you may wish to refer to:

"Ping (referring to the Beiping Action Headquarters): 7.10. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted a written protest to the Japanese Ambassador to China because of the illegal action on July 7th, requesting the Japanese side to fulfill (1) formally apologize to China and punish the responsible personnel; (2) compensate for all losses of deaths, injuries and destruction; (3) guarantee that similar incidents will not occur.

Xin (referring to the Japanese telegram received by the Changxindian secret station): Nanjing diplomats actually want to ask me for an apology, punishment, compensation, etc. in three points on the basis of the July 7th Incident. What status will this put my empire in? Where should I put the prestige of the Imperial Army? My leaders now think that this unreasonable request need not be answered, so they set it aside; because the opponent I am currently negotiating with is General Song Zheyuan, Chairman of Hebei and Chahar."

Free Talk

### Art Trafficking

— Shaofu

I was chatting idly with a few friends in the art world the other day and learned that a very bad phenomenon has been popular in Shanghai recently, which they consider to be very dangerous and urgently needs to be corrected.

This phenomenon is that collectors are almost entirely abandoning silk and taking paper for the collection of calligraphy and painting.

According to my friends, the formation of this trend is entirely due to the operation of profiteering philistine collectors. Because silk is easy to damage, and paper can be sold at a high price. Little do they know that ancient art, especially paintings before the Tang and Song dynasties or of the Tang and Song dynasties, is mostly silk. In this way, it is no different from cutting off the continuation of the life of ancient art. After a few years, the source of our cultural relics will be unknown, which is likely to lead to the annihilation of a nation's history.

According to this friend, Shenzhou Guoguang Society and Youzheng Book Bureau used to focus on reprinting (i.e., reproducing) books and paintings on art. Although their work was not perfect (for example, those art picture postcards only simply wrote a line next to the painting: Painted by a certain person in a certain dynasty, unlike the Japanese, they would explain the era, author, and advantages and characteristics of the painting in detail, popularize art knowledge, and guide readers to appreciate art), they still tried their best in preservation and popularization. But who is engaged in it now?

The worship of money is spreading fiercely and rapidly, and the people of Shanghai can't breathe. Open this skylight and let everyone wake up and improve their tastes!

Anecdotes

### The Origin of the Racecourse

— Gan Lai

The "Legacy" of the Old Era

After the "Opium War," in 1842 (the 22nd year of Daoguang), China and Britain signed the "Treaty of Nanjing," which stipulated that five ports should be opened for trade. Shanghai was officially opened as a commercial port on November 14, 1843. The Shanghai Daotai and the British Consul George Balfour negotiated and delineated the boundary line for foreign residence, which at that time only had an area of 138 acres. Later, China and Britain signed the "Supplementary Treaty of Humen," which stated in Article 7 that British people were allowed to rent land to build houses in the five trading ports, but there were no "Land Regulations" and "Settlement Regulations" at this time. It was not until 1845 that the Shanghai Daotai Gong Mu Jiu signed the "Land Regulations" of 24 articles with the British in his personal name, which became the basis for the creation of the British concession. In 1848, the American concession was established, and in 1863, the two concessions were merged into the Public Concession.

The "Land Regulations" of the Shanghai Concession were revised three times in 1854, 1869, and 1898. The Chinese side was not invited to send anyone to attend the revision, and they only issued a notice to China after they had made the arrangements, which became an accomplished fact. In 1904, the Shanghai Daotai issued a statement allowing the Bureau of Works to directly negotiate land with Chinese owners, and foreigners could arbitrarily expand their property rights in the concession. The current site of the racecourse originally belonged to the fourth Tu of the 25th Bao of Shanghai County. It was a deserted area, and after it was purchased by the British, the property rights became their own.

The first Shanghai racecourse appeared in 1850, located west of Nanjing Road and Henan Road today. It can be mutually verified by old newspapers: "From the fifth to the seventh of April, Westerners held a horse racing meeting. They enclosed several acres of land as a racecourse two miles west of the city. They built a wooden fence around the perimeter, and dug ditches outside the fence. Western men and women built high stands inside the enclosure to watch, and placed money to bet on the outcome. Several riders were dispatched at the same time, dressed in five colors to distinguish them. It was also a grand sight to chase the wind and step on electricity." After two relocations, they finally chose Jing'an Temple Road for construction and established the Racecourse General Association. Every spring and autumn, horse races were held as usual, with prizes and ticket sales, which were the same as gambling, and the profits were amazing. In May 1933, the old site was dismantled, and the magnificent new building was completed on February 10, 1934.

During the period when the enemy and puppet forces occupied the area, horse races were still held on the original site from time to time, but the Chinese people were not very interested in it, and the business was not prosperous.

Currently, the "horse racing" is revived, and there are many rumors. There will be a heated debate in the council. What will happen next? Let's wait and see for the next breakdown! However, to say something objective: whether the horse racing is restored or not depends on the government, and the absolute majority of citizens firmly oppose the opening of the horse ban! I think: the government really doesn't have to resist public opinion for this move!

### Tram Strike

— Yiqun

When I came out of my house yesterday morning and walked to the tram station, I only saw a few people standing idly. The scene of queuing up like a long snake in the past no longer existed. Because the situation was abnormal, I became suspicious, so I asked the people next to me, only to know that the tram was on strike again today!

Later, after reading the newspaper, I learned that two tram ticket vendors were detained for assaulting someone, so all the tram workers went on strike to express their assistance or resistance? Unless the murderer is released, they will not resume work.

We really feel that the unity of the tram workers is quite great. In the past, they once went on strike because their request for a salary increase was not granted, and then went on strike again because they were not allowed to borrow salaries. Once, two workers fought with workers from a certain yarn factory and went on strike. Tram workers often use weapons for private disputes involving a small number of people, which seems to be too clever. Leaving aside the past, let's take yesterday's strike as an example. Two ticket vendors were detained for assaulting someone. The matter is very simple. The right and wrong must be proved by facts, and the guilt or innocence must be based on the law. If the tram workers abide by the law and understand the truth, they should handle the matter according to the law. If there is any grievance, they may as well make it public to the society and let everyone criticize it. If they say that they use strikes as weapons, threaten the law on the one hand, and try to win the sympathy of the society on the other hand, I think how is this different from climbing a tree to catch fish?

The tram is one of the public utilities, which is related to public transportation. Please tram workers, do not frivolously go on strike due to private disputes, so as not to hinder public transportation. You must know that the spirit of your service and the attitude towards passengers have their own public opinion. Why use weapons arbitrarily—strike!

### Gambling and Taxes

— Yang Ren

I once joked with a friend: Now everything is waiting to be revived, and the national treasury is short of money. All local undertakings have no way to start. If the government can use the gambling psychology of the people and openly set up a gambling house in every township, and stipulate a "gambling tax," the income must be considerable. Then "the people are never satisfied with money, and the country gets taxes and grows richer," killing two birds with one stone. There is no better way to make money than this!

### "Shanghai Emperor" Long Live

— Xi Ting

If there were an election for "Shanghai Emperor," I would definitely choose the drivers and ticket conductors of the British-owned tram company.

Apart from the few automobile owners, countless citizens are subjects of this emperor. When the emperor needs to collect taxes from his "people," he will say "Sorry!" in a friendly manner. (At this time, you paid two hundred yuan but only received a ticket worth one hundred and fifty yuan.) Every time they softly and kindly say "Sorry" to me, I always feel flattered and overly nervous, not knowing what to do, because I have not forgotten the emperor's intimidating face when I boarded the tram. I have not forgotten the anger I felt every time a very empty tram passed by the station without stopping, drifting away. However, it is precisely because they are so stern when they don't want me to board that when they change and become as loving as a parent to their children, I feel it is an exceptional favor, and therefore I feel obligated to pay the required "tax." Even if I am unwilling in my heart, I always comfort myself in an Ah Q-like manner: I should be a broad-minded citizen. What happened earlier should be forgiven and forgotten. Now that they are smiling and asking me for money, why should I be so stingy?

At the same time, I always treat the scolding of the ticket conductor emperor as imperial decrees, daring not to resist in the slightest, because otherwise, if an incident of insulting the emperor were to occur, all the emperors might go on strike, wouldn't I be guilty of a crime deserving ten thousand deaths?

Recently, I've heard that disputes often occur between the tram people and the tram emperors. I greatly admire the "audacity" of these "passenger subjects". I don't even dare to look at these emperors!

One, two, three: "Long live the Shanghai Emperor!"

### The Newly Appointed Vice Commander-in-Chief of the Navy - Some Facts About Gui Yongqing

— Chong Zheng

Gui Yongqing, the head of our country's military delegation to the United Kingdom, has been summoned back to the country and honorably appointed as Vice Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, temporarily acting as Commander-in-Chief. With his current position, among those who graduated from the Whampoa Military Academy, few can compare except for Hu Zongnan, Du Yuming, and Guan Linzheng.

Gui is a native of Guixi, Jiangxi province, and a graduate of the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy. After graduation, he served in the military, from platoon leader to regimental commander. In this phase, he climbed the fastest among his first-class classmates. In the Northern Expedition, he was a brave and skilled lower-level officer, and at the time, he was highly regarded by General He Yingqin.

Rising Through Climbing City Walls

I remember once when attacking a certain county town, Chairman Chiang personally commanded and supervised the battle. After fierce fighting for several days and nights, they still couldn't break through. Unable to find a solution, he ordered General He Yingqin to organize a suicide squad. However, they had all kinds of talent, but lacked someone skilled in climbing the city walls to become an internal operative. While General He was hesitating, Gui volunteered to step forward. In reality, he didn't know how to climb city walls, it was just his courage. As a result, they captured the city in one fell swoop, creating a major victory. The Chairman was extremely pleased and immediately asked He Yingqin, what was the name of the officer who climbed the city wall? He replied, "Gui Yongqing." The Chairman immediately ordered his promotion by one rank. From then on, the names "Gui Yongqing" were deeply imprinted in the minds of the Chairman and General He Yingqin.

His achievements in the Northern Expedition led to his promotion to major general and commander of the Training Corps. Before the war, the Training Corps was a national model army. The officers were all from military academies, and the soldiers were intellectuals. The education was German-style, so the Training Corps was famous throughout the country and became a model unit praised and admired by the people. General Gui's fame was also largely due to leading the Training Corps.

When the War of Resistance broke out, the Training Corps took the initiative to participate in the war. At the time, Chairman Chiang did not want them to sacrifice themselves. However, the brave soldiers led by General Gui repeatedly insisted. Their slogan was "Loyalty to the Party and Love for the Country". When the country was in a critical moment, it was the opportunity for soldiers to defend their territory and repay the country. As a result, the Training Corps did their best. Even when only one bullet and one person remained, they continued to fight bravely. Therefore, they all made a heroic sacrifice. This spirit of not knowing personal interests was the result of General Gui's strict military training and education. However, Chairman Chiang wept bitterly after hearing the news, believing that the sacrifice of this group of energetic young soldiers was a great loss to the country!

Fighting in All Directions

After the fall of Shanghai, Gui continued to command a large army, fighting on battlefields in all directions, until after the Battle of Lanfeng, he was transferred to serve as the education director of the Military Affairs Committee Training Corps. Therefore, many people were unfamiliar with him during the War of Resistance. In fact, he had always stood on the front lines of the war. The batches of students who graduated from the Military Affairs Committee Training Corps were the result of Gui's education.

In 1944, Gui was ordered to serve as the head of the military delegation to the United Kingdom. After Germany surrendered, he went to Berlin to study European military affairs, and to research new military tactics with Allied generals, as well as plans for the occupation and control of Germany. He was already a figure praised by British and American military personnel.

Recently, General Gui Yongqing has returned to the country and has been appointed as the Vice Commander-in-Chief of the new navy. We hope that he will live up to the enthusiastic love of the people and make some achievements for the rebuilt navy!
