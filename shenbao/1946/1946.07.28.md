### Ambassador Stuart Arrives in Kuling Yesterday; Immediately After Unpacking, He Meets with Marshal Ma and Formulates New Suggestions for Our Overall Situation

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanking, 27th] Ambassador Stuart arrived in Kuling at 11:10 AM today, following Marshal Ma's departure from Nanking to Kiukiang and then to Kuling. As the KMT-CCP negotiations are about to resume, the visit of the two men to Lushan has brought a sense of calm to the political atmosphere here. It is reported that both men will return to Nanking next Monday. Marshal Ma and Stuart's purpose in going is to convey to Chairman Chiang the opinions offered by Zhou Enlai in his separate discussions with the two men. It is said that the Communist Party's insistence is for an immediate and unconditional comprehensive ceasefire and the resumption of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), and that a document similar to a ceasefire agreement has been drafted and taken to Lushan by Ambassador Stuart. This place is currently quietly awaiting the return of Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart. It is speculated that the current point of contention between the two sides is that the government wants to reach an agreement on restoring transportation, reorganizing the army, and a ceasefire before implementing the decisions made by the past PCC, item by item. The Communist Party's insistence on immediately convening the PCC is unnecessary because all basic issues have already been agreed upon in the past PCC. Moreover, since the beginning of the talks, the Communist side has lacked sincerity, and whenever the negotiations are about to conclude, they raise new demands, causing complications and overturning agreements. Although the government has repeatedly made concessions and shown tolerance, it has been unable to make progress in the negotiations. Therefore, based on past lessons, the government has to insist on signing after reaching an agreement on everything, so that the Communist Party cannot repeat its old tricks. Although the whole country is paying attention to whether the Chairman will issue a ceasefire order when the two men go to Lushan again, the entire future depends on the fundamental attitude of the Communists.

[Dispatch from Reuters, Nanking, 27th] Before leaving for Kuling today, Ambassador Stuart stated that he hoped this trip would break the deadlock in the negotiations by the end of the week. He said: "New suggestions have been drafted by Marshall and me to strive for mutual acceptance by both sides. I have high hopes for this because the difficulties lie not in fundamental issues, but only in procedural matters."

[Dispatch from United Press, Washington, 27th] Ambassador Gu Weijun stated today that regarding the KMT-CCP issue, the Chinese government hopes for a peaceful resolution and does not believe that the Communist Party is willing to bear the responsibility of "plunging the country into civil war."

### Changchun Forward Detachment Announces Discussions on Establishing a Buffer Zone; Agreement May Also Be Reached on Power Transmission and Prisoner Repatriation

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 28th] While the flames of war have not yet subsided in China Proper, the Northeast presents a picture of peace. Certain minor issues, such as prisoner repatriation, power transmission, and buffer zones, may be resolved. Regarding the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war and Japanese nationals from the Communist-controlled areas, the Communist Party has indicated that there is no problem in principle. Colonel Bavin and Lieutenant Colonel Mullin of the U.S. Prisoner Repatriation Group of the Executive Headquarters are currently in Changchun to discuss specific measures with the Communist Party. An agreement should be reached soon. Regarding the issue of power supply from Xiaofengman to Shenyang, the Shenyang electricity shortage is severe because a section of the line in the middle is occupied and damaged by the Communist army. The government and the Communist Party have now agreed that the Communist Party will repair the damaged lines in the Communist-controlled area, and the government will repair the lines in the government-controlled area, and then they will be connected to transmit power.

### Internal Strife Among the Democratic League; Zhang Lan and Luo Longji Debate Neutrality

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Nanking, 27th] An internal dispute over neutrality has recently broken out within the Democratic League. The fact that League Chairman Zhang Lan and Luo Longji had a public dispute over this issue today clearly shows that the two men have different views on neutrality. Zhang, a proponent of neutrality, stated in his article "The Attitude and Style of the Democratic League," published in the Chengdu Huaxi Evening News a few days ago: "Mr. Luo Longji said in a speech in Shanghai that our Democratic League is not neutral towards the KMT and the CCP, but has a sense of right and wrong. This was a personal statement and a small error. Our Democratic League has always stood on the position of the Democratic League, and must adhere to neutrality towards the KMT and the CCP. Standing on the position of the country, we must clearly distinguish right from wrong in the actions of the KMT and the CCP." Zhang also said: "The Democratic League is willing to abide by the Three Principles of the People and is also willing to support Chairman Chiang. If the Three Principles of the People can be implemented, and political democratization and military nationalization can be achieved without being empty words, our Democratic League will be devoted to the ruling Kuomintang, not just become its tail." It is understood that after Zhang's article was published, Luo Longji reportedly told people that his remarks in Shanghai stated that the Democratic League stands on the position of the Chinese people and is not neutral towards the Chinese civil war. Only foreigners need to strictly adhere to neutrality. Luo believes that Zhang Lan's remarks may have been caused by a misunderstanding of the content of his remarks. Luo also said: The headquarters of the Democratic League is now in Nanking, and his personal remarks have their own basis. In the future, the documents of the Democratic League should be based on those published by the headquarters. As for Zhang's articles, they may have been ghostwritten by others.

### Minister Peng Hosts Shanghai Reporters, Condemns "Unconditional Ceasefire": The CCP Merely Seeks to Delay, The People of North China Provinces are Suffering Deeply from Blockade

[Our Correspondent] Peng Xuepei, Minister of Information, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 25th. Yesterday (the 27th) at 4 p.m., he hosted reporters in the Shanghai Municipal Government conference room. Minister Peng began by stating: "I had the pleasure of hosting you all here three weeks ago. I am especially pleased to reconvene today. I am willing to answer any questions to the best of my knowledge." Subsequently, reporters from various newspapers successively rose to ask questions, which Minister Peng answered in detail.

Kunming Incident

(Question) What is the situation regarding the Kunming assassination case?

(Answer) The government attaches great importance to the case and has dispatched key personnel to Kunming to investigate. The Executive Yuan has ordered all regions to take responsibility for protecting the lives and property of the people, and it is especially important to strengthen protection during these tense times. Twelve members of the Democratic League in Kunming sought refuge in the American consulate. The Executive Yuan specifically telegraphed local authorities instructing them to provide protection to those who seek government protection without hindering their freedom of movement. Although there are leads in the case, we do not intend to speculate before the full truth is revealed. However, once the truth is determined, those responsible, regardless of their affiliation, will be severely punished.

(Question) It has been reported that a certain young master was involved. Can you share the details?

(Answer) This is a legal matter. I prefer to disclose the full truth after it is fully understood.

Peace Negotiations

(Question) Since Ambassador Stuart's arrival, there is hope for a breakthrough in the KMT-CCP negotiations. Ambassador Marshall is now returning to Guling. Please provide an update on the negotiations and the military situation. On the 22nd, Moscow Radio criticized the United States for failing to complete the withdrawal in accordance with the decisions of the Three Foreign Ministers Conference. What is the government's view on Moscow Radio's urging of the US military withdrawal? The Wenhui Bao was suspended for seven days by the Shanghai Police Bureau. What is the legal basis for this?

(Answer) The rapid progress of the peace negotiations is detailed in the news. I have nothing further to add. The government initially ordered a two-week ceasefire, which was later extended by ten days. The duration of the negotiations cannot be considered short, and a beneficial resolution should have been reached, but it has not been. The government feels that the key lies in the reorganization and unification of the army, and the restoration of transportation. These two points are equally important. To date, the CCP still only proposes "unconditional ceasefire." We are all striving for a ceasefire. However, we cannot ignore several pressing issues that urgently need to be resolved. If we ignore these issues and only talk about "unconditional ceasefire," its meaning will be tantamount to the unconditional secession of the Northeast, the unconditional interruption of transportation, and the unconditional competition in army expansion and increased military spending. In short, this will be tantamount to unconditionally prolonging the chaotic political and military situation and trapping the country in difficulty. The CCP's suggestion of an "unconditional ceasefire" is due to the CCP's violation of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, occupation of most of the Northeast, and its attempt to prolong economic chaos to gain "revolutionary" opportunities. I will now briefly cite several pieces of evidence to illustrate the economic suffering, high prices, and the people's lack of livelihood, which are largely due to the CCP's blockade of Shandong, Henan, and Northern Jiangsu. The reason is that once the two major railways, Jinpu Railway and Pinghan Railway, are cut off, the north-south freight transport is interrupted, prices soar, and refugees cannot return home; The main coal producing areas are in Shandong and Henan provinces. Today, they are either destroyed or produce very little, almost at a standstill. Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and other places must rely on Qinhuangdao for long-distance coal supplies, so the price is as high as 230,000 yuan per ton; The food supply for Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, and Qingdao has always relied on areas outside these cities. The monthly rice demand for Beijing and Tianjin is 600,000 dan, and for Jinan and Qingdao it is 240,000 dan, all supplied by villages in Hebei and Shandong provinces. Today, due to the CCP's blockade, they must be supplied by Beijing and Shanghai, but Beijing and Shanghai are not rice-producing areas, so it indirectly affects the food problem in Beijing and Shanghai, which becomes more serious and spreads throughout the country; According to a 1936 survey, Hebei produced 8 million dan of salt, Shandong produced 7.5 million dan, and Northern Jiangsu produced 9 million dan. The total national production was 48 million dan, and consumption was 34 million dan. Now, one-third of the salt production area in Hebei is occupied by the CCP, and most of the production areas in Shandong and Northern Jiangsu are in the hands of the CCP, so salt cannot be transported out, causing salt shortages in North and Central China. From this, we can see that economic difficulties are closely related to the CCP's blockade policy. The restoration of transportation is of vital importance to the people and cannot be delayed any longer. Therefore, the ceasefire is what the government has always advocated, but various urgent issues other than the ceasefire should also be resolved together.

Regarding the second point, the US military has provided assistance in China for many years and is greatly related to the victory. Even after the victory, its assistance was significant in all aspects such as the repatriation of POWs. We are all grateful for this. Currently, their assistance is still needed for POW repatriation. In the future, we also hope that they can provide technical assistance in military reorganization. Most of the US military has now withdrawn, leaving only a very small part in China, which does not harm our sovereignty. Last year, the US government announced its policy toward China, stating that it would provide economic assistance to China under the condition that the government's foundation is expanded. We firmly believe that the US motivation is based on sincere friendship, and we have worked hard to achieve it. This is also our goal. However, the CCP's procrastination in resolving problems makes us suspect that the CCP is delaying its cooperation with the government as it learns of the US intentions. The CCP's attitude is to avoid resolving various issues and hope that economic difficulties and a chaotic situation will allow them to seize national power in the near future. This strategy is clearly sufficient to destroy the ultimate goal of US policy toward China and infinitely delay the realization of Sino-US cooperation and mutual assistance.

Regarding the third point: The Wenhui Bao was executed according to martial law and the publication law by the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, and the Ministry of Propaganda has no objections. I only hope that during this tense period, we should be especially cautious in our writing and hope to cooperate with the government.

Other Questions

(Question) The National Assembly is about to convene. Does the government have any plans for reorganization before the convention?

(Answer) The government can reorganize at any time, and the scope of the reorganization can be large or small, but all basic issues must be effectively resolved first. If all practical solutions cannot be obtained, then political forces will not be able to achieve true close cooperation.

Minister Peng pointed out that the Soviet Union's "Izvestia" attacked the National Salvation Daily, saying that our press should handle speech related to diplomatic relations with extreme care. He stated: "The opinion of one newspaper cannot represent the opinion of the majority. However, at present, we should avoid articles that stimulate the feelings of allied countries, whether it is toward the Soviet Union, the United States, or the United Kingdom and France. During this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for construction, we should bury our heads in hard work for thirty to fifty years and never casually criticize foreign countries." He also said: Today, there are a few newspapers with various attacks on the United States, which should be avoided.

At this point, it was 5:15 p.m. Because Minister Peng still had to host foreign reporters, he announced the adjournment of the meeting.

### Local Correspondence

The Price of Indigo in Xiyi is Low, Requesting Government Purchase

[Our Correspondent in Wuxi] The preparatory office of the Wuxi County Cooperative Federation stated that since the government had lent 70% of the funds to farmers as relief during the spring rains this year, the farmers did not sell their dried indigo. Selling at the current market price of indigo would result in huge losses. It has telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the Construction Department to appeal for relief, requesting the government to order the China Silk Company to purchase the indigo at the standard price plus interest. After the telegram was sent, the Ministry of Economic Affairs instructed that the Shanghai China Silk Company had been ordered to handle the matter.

Changshu: Pirates Caught in Military Grain Robbery Case

In September, the military transported more than 1,000 dan of military rice from Wuhu, which was robbed by a young general outside the mouth of Hupu. All the military rice was robbed. The case has now been solved. The main culprits are Bai Fengxiang and Deng Jiabin, the heads of the notorious pirate Xia Dehai's subordinates. The headquarters of the 21st Division of the National Army stationed in Kunshan discovered clues and sent personnel to Changshu to cooperate with the garrison and the Hupu Self-Defense Force.

Editorial

### Who is Peace For?

Special Envoy Marshall flew from Nanjing to Guling again the day before yesterday, running around for peace in China. He and Ambassador Stuart, at such advanced ages, braved the summer heat and the rain, traveling between Nanjing and Guling, all in the name of seeking peace for China.

As ordinary Chinese citizens, we feel ashamed and indignant to see that after the country's victory, we still have to trouble our allies so much. Ashamed because why can't the Chinese take care of their own affairs? Why can't the kind guidance of our allies inspire the conscience of the Chinese people to save themselves and seek peace? Indignant because the Chinese people, especially the approximately 80% who are farmers, have suffered from natural and man-made disasters and are on the verge of death, and yet there are still ambitious politicians who rely on force, create internal strife, and divide the country. They claim to solve the problems of the farmers, but in reality, they are making the farmers wander around, abandoning their fields, and ultimately "unable to return home," forced to be coerced and slaughtered. Amidst this intertwined complex of shame and indignation, as Marshall and Stuart are enthusiastically running around for peace, we can no longer bear it and want to ask one question: "Who is peace for, after all?"

Let us first straightforwardly answer ourselves: "Peace is for the Chinese people!"

Some may think that this question is superfluous, but it is not. Because some Chinese and foreign people have overlooked the most important point: the reason why China needs peace is to allow the Chinese people to live and work in peace and contentment, to allow the people to breathe after the war, to achieve peace and contentment, and to revive and build the country. However, if they disregard this key point, they will inevitably misjudge things to some extent, thinking that China wants peace so that parties can divide power, or thinking that China wants peace so that the Chinese issue will not cause World War III. In fact, these have nothing to do with the Chinese people. Even if there is some relationship, it is not direct, let alone the immediate pain of the people. What the Chinese people care about most is that they can return to their hometowns, return home, cultivate their fields, have factories and mines to work in, and have open railways and sea routes to transport goods back and forth for business. In short, their most basic and simple requirement is the four words "live and work in peace and contentment." Those who seek peace and those who engage in the peace movement, whether Chinese or foreign, must focus on this in order to find a proper path and obtain concrete results. If they do not think about how the people can live and work in peace and contentment, but only think about how a certain party or faction can get a share of the power or occupy a province or city in military power, that is simply abandoning the root and pursuing the branches. Although the efforts are great, it is still a big question whether it will be effective.

We dare to say: Peace is a means, and the people's peaceful life and work is the goal. The government's responsibility to the people is to enable them to live and work in peace and contentment. If peaceful methods can allow the people to enjoy the blessings of "peaceful life and work," we can negotiate peacefully. We not only do not object, but also welcome it; on the contrary, if the government is only focused on peace negotiations, but the people still cannot return to their hometowns, cannot return home, cannot live in peace, cannot work in contentment, and even increase their pain of being displaced and unemployed, as is the case in Northern Jiangsu, Southern Shandong, and Central Shanxi, how will the government be worthy of the people? To give a few more examples: How can the industries and businesses in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao, and Jinan recover? Needless to say, it must rely on the production of farmland and coal mines in Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Henan. If the Huai River basin at the junction of Northern Jiangsu, Northern Anhui, Shandong, and Henan is always occupied by the CCP's army, which attempts to divide China, disrupting railways and highways and failing to supply food and coal, how can we expect the industries and businesses in these places to recover? The situation is the same in the Beijing-Tianjin area. If the CCP's army in Shanxi and along the Jinpu and Beining Railways continues to jump around, how can cities like Beijing and Tianjin recover and prosper? Therefore, we believe that the problem today is not really whether there is peace or not, but whether the government can protect the people's peaceful life and work. This is the government's responsibility! The government must not use the obstruction of a certain party or faction or the disruption of a certain army or division as an excuse to close the door to peaceful resolution, and just watch the people suffer forever, wander, and be displaced and unemployed without saving them! If the government only knows how to pretend to be "peaceful" and ignores the life and death of the people, all the evils in the world will spread under the protection of the "peace" amulet, then the people will hold the government accountable.

Speaking of this, we cannot but admire the correctness of the New York Times' observation. The New York Times' commentary on the 24th believed that if there is "any protest about the Chinese peace issue, it should not be directed at the National Government and its supporters, but should severely condemn those who oppose the government and divide China." This is a truly insightful argument. All the problems in China today stem from the fact that there are some people inside and outside who are trying to "divide China!" Because they vainly attempt to divide China, they do not hesitate to oppose the National Government, do not hesitate to slander the leaders of China, do not hesitate to lower China's international status, do not hesitate to create internal strife in China, do not hesitate to use brutal prisoners of war and have them use their weapons to kill Chinese people, do not hesitate to coerce kind Chinese farmers, thereby destroying railways, robbing goods, and harming the credibility of legal tender, provoking resentment between labor and management, and disrupting the entire financial and market situation. All their methods aim to prevent China from being peaceful, to prevent the Chinese people from having food to eat, to prevent the Chinese people from living and working in peace and contentment after the war, and even more to prevent China from achieving, as we hope, a strong, unified, and democratic China in the years after the war. Their mantra is "peace," but their actions all run counter to the peace that the people hope for.

Therefore, today, we are willing to sincerely remind the party leaders in China who claim to be third parties and the fair-minded friends in the United States: If you truly want to seek peace for China, sincerely ask the people what they hope for. The Chinese people only long for two things: The National Government, recognized by China and foreign countries, will automatically move towards democracy and progress in politics, expand the foundation of the government, and quickly implement the Three Principles of the People, especially the economic policies of the Principle of People's Livelihood. The National Government, recognized by China and foreign countries, must thoroughly implement its national policy of unifying military and political orders in military affairs, be responsible for protecting all kind people, and enable them to live and work in peace and contentment in the short term, and there is absolutely no reason to allow this half-dead situation to drag on. In particular, we want to urge those who intend to promote peace in China to quickly realize that the more you overemphasize the CCP, which is known for its broken promises, the more the CCP will be smug and act recklessly, making it even more difficult to achieve peace in China. Everyone must turn around and think about the people, not just the Communist Party, and then the peace in China that we achieve will be the true peace of China, the permanent peace of China.

### Demanding the Publication of the Treaty Drafts; US Receives Replies from Three Countries; Opinions Not Yet Fully Consistent

[United Press Washington, 26th] Diplomatic officials announced today that Secretary of State Byrnes has made some progress in negotiations with relevant countries regarding the immediate publication of the European treaty drafts by the US, Soviet Union, Britain, and France. The other three governments have submitted replies to the American note. The British Foreign Office's reply does not agree to the publication before all the countries invited to participate in the conference have formally received the treaty drafts. The French Foreign Office's reply largely expresses agreement but does not allow for unilateral publication in Paris, advocating for simultaneous publication in the capitals of the four countries. The Soviet reply stated that the Soviet government does not see why it is necessary to publish parts of the treaty that have not yet reached a consensus among the relevant countries. Washington interprets this statement as implying that the Soviet Union has agreed to partially publish the treaty drafts.

[United Press Washington, 26th] Secretary of State Byrnes announced today that US troops will withdraw 90 days after the Italian treaty takes effect, implying that British troops will do the same.

### Asahi Shimbun Discusses Nanjing Massacre: Japanese Army's Shameless Atrocities; People Were Deceived

[United Press Tokyo, 27th] The Asahi Shimbun discussed today the testimony regarding the Japanese army's atrocities in Nanjing given at the Far East International Military Tribunal yesterday, stating: The Nanjing atrocities were known to the world at the time, but only the Japanese people were kept in the dark about the shameless behavior of their army. The military's news reports concealed the Nanjing atrocities. The Japanese people did not suspect that such terrifying atrocities were occurring while they were waving flags and celebrating victory. At that time, Japanese newspapers were filled with war exploits and did not contain a single word about the truth of the Nanjing Incident. Recalling this, one cannot help but feel regret. The commander of the Japanese army involved in the atrocities was praised, and none of his subordinates were punished, which clearly proves that Japan had lost all conscience at the time.

### Items Seized During the Sino-Japanese War; Our Request for Return Unsuccessful; Allied Headquarters Said It Had No Authority to Handle

[Agence France-Presse Tokyo, 26th] Several iron anchors, hoards of tools, iron chains, and shells from Chinese warships captured during the Sino-Japanese War (1895) were displayed as war trophies in a certain park in Tokyo.

### US Chief Prosecutor Declares Five Major Crimes of German Nazis; All 22 Principal Criminals Should Be Executed

[United States Information Service Washington, 26th] US Chief Prosecutor Jackson's speech is divided into four parts. The first part is a brief introduction. The tenth part is titled "Crimes of the Nazi Regime," including the following five points: Seizing power and turning Germany into a police state. Preparing and waging aggressive wars. Conducting war without regard to international law. Enslaving and plundering the people of occupied countries. Persecuting and exterminating Jews and Christians. The third part is titled "Common Plan or Conspiracy," and the fourth part is titled "Common Defense Against Charges of Joint Responsibility."

### Many Japanese Industries to Be Taken Over by US Military

[United Press Tokyo, 27th] Many Japanese industries used to pay for reparations will be taken over by the US Eighth Army and the US Navy in the near future. Based on the suggestion of Commissioner Pauley, it is expected that the factories to be taken over will include machine tool manufacturing plants, shipyards, steel mills, power plants, aluminum and magnesium manufacturing plants, and some chemical manufacturing plants. There are already 390 Japanese factories, such as aircraft factories and ordnance factories, that were taken over by MacArthur's headquarters in January of last year. According to Pauley's provisional recommendation: half of the machine tools, equipment, and parts in Japan's 20 shipyards should be removed, and the equipment of the remaining coal-fired power plants and 20 caustic soda manufacturing plants, as well as the production of aluminum and magnesium, should also be reduced by half. This would make it so Japan is soft to manage. The work and production of some Japanese factories will be temporarily suspended, and the production of the remaining factories will also be gradually reduced. Under the supervision of the US military, the Japanese side will classify and prepare a list of the equipment of each factory and send it to Washington for the Far Eastern Commission's reference. Countries that are to receive Japanese reparations will submit their compensation requests based on the list.

### Soviet Union Closes in on German Intellectuals; Adopts Appeasement Tactics

[United Press Berlin, 26th] The Soviet Union is taking a two-pronged approach to win the friendship of those in the German cultural sphere, taking into account both the pride and vanity of the Germans and their stomachs, a tactic that the British and Americans have not matched. According to a certain German intellectual, the Soviet Union never makes us feel like a defeated country, while the British and Americans often make us feel that they are the victors at certain times. A famous German playwright said that if we want to publish or stage a script, we have to contact the Americans ourselves to make it happen. The Soviet side does not hesitate to take the initiative, even using special material conditions to induce artists to cooperate. According to some Germans, at a time when bread is scarce in the country and money is especially important, a waitress in the American-occupied zone earns more to fill her stomach than the best musician. In the current situation in Germany, it seems that only wages that fill the stomach are the most important.

### Brandy Risks Danger on Official Duty; Personally Inspects Bikini Atoll; Suffers Atomic Radiation Attack

[International News Service Bikini, 27th] Today's News: General Brandy suffered excessive atomic radiation yesterday while inspecting the target ships "Long" and "Pennsylvania," exceeding the limit by 5%. Colonel Warren, director of the Hydrogen Radiation Safety Protection Team, said: "If General Brandy had stayed there for a few more minutes yesterday, he and his entourage would have suffered serious damage."

### Analysis of the German Governance Problem; Translated by the United States Information Service from "US News"

The establishment of European peace has encountered difficulties due to the question of whether Germany should remain unified or be divided into four parts. The US and Britain advocate maintaining German unity and merging the four occupation zones into one. The US and Britain now spend 500 million dollars annually on their occupying forces in Germany. If their proposal is realized, perhaps the number of occupying forces can be reduced. Byrnes suggested that American military force should still be used for 25 years to guarantee that the rebuilt Germany remains demilitarized and does not disrupt peace. The Soviet Union and France oppose German unification. France advocates separating the Ruhr and Rhineland regions from Germany and governing them separately under international control. According to France's idea, if France is not to be threatened by German aggression, Germany must be a semi-independent, weak, and loose federation. The Soviet Union seems to have no concrete plan on how to deal with Germany in the future, but it clearly opposes the new American plan. Currently, Germany has already been divided into four parts.

The Four Powers Act Independently

Therefore, extremely high isolation barriers have been built around the four occupation zones. The Soviet occupation zone is east of the Elbe River, and major changes are now taking place in the zone. The Soviets have begun to close banks and confiscate assets. They have divided all the assets of the Junker families among the farmers, and they have also formed powerful trade unions for the workers in the mines and factories, in a form similar to Soviet trade unions. The Soviet authorities are making factory owners choose between two paths: either the factory is operated according to the orders of the trade union, or it is dismantled and sent to the Soviet Union. American observers report: the Soviet zone is like an extremely tense beehive, and the number of unemployed people seems to have decreased. The current production of factories has reached 90% of their productivity. The land in the Soviet-occupied zone accounts for 27% of Germany's arable land and is sufficient to feed the 21 million people in the zone.

The American Occupation Zone

In western Germany, the area is similar to the Soviet-occupied zone, but in all other respects, they are unlike each other. The land, raw materials, and industries are not enough to feed and employ the 18 million people in the zone. The mines and factories in the zone were once estimated to account for 20% of Germany's production, but at this moment they are useless because they lack coal, oil, steel, rubber, and other raw materials. Although the US has shipped large quantities of rice, the zone is still suffering from a rice shortage. The production of factories that have been decided not to be dismantled for reparations is only 10% to 20% of their productivity. As a result, nearly one-third of the workers are unemployed, and most of the population in the towns and cities, whether employed or unemployed, is not fed, clothed, or housed well. Under these circumstances, the American side finds it difficult to rebuild the occupation zone like America, according to capitalist democracy. As a result of implementing the plan to eliminate Nazi forces, 300,000 Nazis have been discovered, but the scourge of the Nazi Party is still taking place underground. Although anti-Nazi parties have been revived, so far they seem to have no clear direction. As for the British, who occupy the industrialized Ruhr region, they have also encountered political difficulties, but the economic situation is much better than the American side.

The British Occupation Army Government

Has enabled the zone's industry to recover to 40% of its pre-war output. However, Ruhr coal usually supplies three-quarters of German industry and half of European industry's needs, but current production is only 35% of pre-war levels. Before the war, Germany produced 22 million tons of steel, with the Ruhr region accounting for two-thirds of this amount. This year, it can only produce 2 million tons. The British occupation zone is so important because the Ruhr has the potential for coal and steel production that is greater than any other region in Europe. As for agricultural production, it is still far from being self-sufficient. The zone has a population of 23 million, and the need for food imports is extremely high. In terms of industry, the Ruhr region accounted for 36% of Germany's total pre-war production. The British hope to increase the Ruhr's production to near pre-war levels as much as possible in order to help rebuild Europe and to open up the European market for British goods. However, France has always feared that the Ruhr will become a strategic powerhouse for Germany, unless the Ruhr can be separated from Germany and co-managed by the Allied countries, including France. Britain has informally proposed a compromise plan: the Ruhr is co-managed internationally for 50 years. French observers suspect that Britain's plan will be implemented when the Allied military occupation of Germany ends. If this is the case, the British will gradually Anglicize the Ruhr in a few years and tighten British control over the region.

From the Perspective of the French

The French occupation zone is another reason for French concern about the industrialized Ruhr. Among the four countries' occupation zones, the French occupation zone is the smallest and poorest. Its land, industry, and population account for only 8% of the total of Germany. Since the beginning of French rule, it has been trying its best to sell coal and building materials and transport them to France as soon as possible. In short, the Soviet Union is developing its occupation zone according to the ideals of Soviet communism. Therefore, land reforms have been carried out, trade unions manage industries, and the German Communist Party is politically very powerful. The British have already nationalized coal mines in the occupied zone and are planning to deal with other industries in the Ruhr region according to the policies of the British Labour Party. The United States promotes free enterprise and hopes to use the advantages of capitalism and democracy to eliminate the disadvantages of Nazism. The French occupation zone is reflecting France's chaotic and experimental situation. Due to each acting independently.

Economic Isolation in the Four Zones

Difficulties are increasing. There is still no unified currency, financial, or accounting policy in Germany. Prices vary in each zone. Trade between zones is small and irregular, often carried out through long military negotiations and barter trade. Even transportation is hindered by zonal boundaries. In terms of Germany's four parts, no zone can obtain the raw materials needed to manufacture its required goods. Therefore, the result is economic depression everywhere. On a larger scale, economic depression has also occurred throughout Europe. The goods that Europe urgently needs for reconstruction cannot be adequately satisfied due to the lack of German coal and , German technology and transportation networks. Politically speaking, the German Communist Party is trying to merge with the German Social Democratic Party. The smaller Communist Party hopes to promote the newly formed organization through this merger and expand its influence to all occupation zones. This is indeed a political control approach. What Western Allied countries are most concerned about is that the economic depression in western Germany may just be clearing the way for the German Communist Party's influence. Recently, American publishers traveled to the American-occupied zone in Germany and felt that the current policies must be changed. The reason is this. They believe that establishing a central government and amending the Potsdam Agreement may revive the European economy and tear down the separating walls that divide the four powers and Germany. The principles of the four-power treaty on Germany recently proposed by the US Secretary of State are also the same as those of the American publishers.

### Gunfire as Dense as Interlinked Beads Outside the Chongxin Yarn Factory: Robbery of Huge Sums, Police and Bandits Engage in Fierce Battle, One Bandit Seriously Wounded in a Crossfire, Two Cars Stolen and All Escape

[Our Correspondent] Yesterday, at the Chongxin Yarn Factory located at No. 1 Tanjia Ferry, West Guangfu Road, Zhabei, was the day for paying wages. At approximately 11:40 AM, over 45 million Legal Tender was withdrawn from the bank. The funds were transported by car to behind the No. 7 Factory of the China Textile Corporation on Changshou Road, where several employees carried them onto a ferry, fearing accidents. They requested a patrol officer for escort, who accompanied them across the Suzhou Creek. As the boat approached the opposite bank, two employees, each carrying a paper package containing 10 million (totaling 20 million) had just stepped onto the dock when two bandits, lying in wait, produced firearms, ordering them not to make a sound, and seized the 20 million. At this time, the patrol officer was still inside the cabin, witnessing the scene, realized it was a robbery, drew his gun and fired repeatedly until his ammunition was exhausted. One bullet struck a bandit in the back of the head, causing him to fall to the ground, bleeding profusely. Simultaneously, more than ten accomplices scattered around also opened fire to resist arrest, firing as many as thirty or forty shots. Two police officers inside the Chongxin Yarn Factory, hearing the dense gunfire like interlinked beads, fired several rifle shots from the upper floors towards the bandits. The bandits, caught in a crossfire, fearing they would be overwhelmed, hurriedly supported the wounded bandit and fled. After traveling about ten yards, they saw a red car decorated with flowers parked on the roadside (belonging to Chongxin, license plate 36149). The bandits swarmed into the car, the wounded bandit was also carried in, and one of the bandits drove eastward. At the intersection of Zhongshan Road and Gonghe Road, a gray ten-wheeled truck (license plate 272969) from the Transportation Department's Highway Administration, carrying several crates, was approaching. The bandits, finding that the flowered car had a mechanical failure and could not move forward, fearing pursuers, stopped the truck, forced the driver out at gunpoint, and one of the bandits drove it straight towards the urban area on Qishan Road. According to eyewitnesses, one of the wounded bandits in the red car fell out of the car due to the rough road, unconscious. Later, his accomplices carried him back into the car. Upon receiving the report, the Pulu Precinct immediately ordered all officers to pursue in all directions, and notified all precincts to be on the lookout for the Highway Administration truck that was robbed. Finally, at 9:30 PM, the truck was discovered on Tongzhou Road in Tilanqiao, empty.

### Japanese Sailors Stranded in Shanghai to Board Ship for Return to Japan Today

After the Customs dredged the Huangpu River, the 76 Japanese sailors and one captain who came to Shanghai with the ship were requested by the Dredging Bureau to be sent back to Japan by the Port Transportation Command. However, the last repatriation ship had already departed Shanghai on the 11th of this month, leaving the repatriation of this group of Japanese sailors problematic, and they were stranded in Zhanghuabang. Later, a request was telegraphed to MacArthur, and a small destroyer was dispatched from Japan to Shanghai to carry the stranded Japanese sailors. The ship has now arrived in Shanghai and will set sail for Japan today.

They were selected to go to the United States last year after the victory, to study and train in railways, postal services, telecommunications, highways, shipping, etc. for nearly a year. They have gained a lot of knowledge and skills in the latest European and American transportation. Various agencies of the Ministry of Transportation in Shanghai, such as the Two Roads Administration, the Shanghai Office of the Highway Administration, and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works, gave them a warm reception. It is reported that all personnel will go to Beijing at the end of this month to report to the Ministry of Transportation. The principle is to restore the positions they held when they were sent out, but the specifics will be determined by the Ministry of Transportation after they report to Beijing.

### Urging Reports of Wartime Public and Private Losses

During the War of Resistance, the casualties and losses of public and private property nationwide were appalling. These are blood debts that should be compensated by those responsible. It is learned that the Executive Yuan's Compensation Investigation Committee is responsible for investigating the losses of population and property nationwide, and has instructed provincial and municipal governments to conduct detailed investigations and report them. The Shanghai Municipal Government had already issued a notice and instructed subordinate departments to investigate and report. However, many organs, organizations, industrial and commercial circles, and individuals in the city have submitted loss reports, and they are being compiled and statistically analyzed. Now, the Municipal Government has received an urgent telegram from the Executive Yuan's Compensation Investigation Committee, urging them to report within a time limit, and has ordered them to step up their work and complete the report before August 15th. If any sectors have suffered wartime losses and have not yet reported them, they can still supplement their reports before the deadline; otherwise, they will no longer be included in the compilation.

### Lack of Raw Materials and High Interest Rates: Severe Crisis in the Handkerchief Industry

Industry Association Hosts News Media to Report

[Our Correspondent] The Shanghai Handkerchief Weaving Industry Association held a reception for the local news media at its association headquarters at 3:00 PM yesterday. Xu Zixin, manager of the Hanyang Handkerchief Factory, and Cai Ruomin, manager of the Wanxiang Handkerchief Factory, reported on the severe crisis facing the handkerchief factories. They stated that the domestic handkerchief weaving industry is centered in Shanghai, with very little production elsewhere. There are currently 72 handkerchief factories in the city, but if politics and the economy do not get on track, it is predicted that half of them will close down within the next few months, because even if there are factories, machines, and employees, there is still no hope of starting work. The reasons are fivefold: too high interest rates, lack of raw materials, declining sales, too heavy taxation, and unreasonable labor relations. Mr. Cai finally stated: The handkerchief weaving industry is now at its wit's end, and they hope that all sectors can sympathize and provide assistance, otherwise they will be forced to suspend operations voluntarily.

### Xie Baosheng, Not Entirely Without Merit, Sentenced to Two and a Half Years, Thanks the Court, Claims He Disagrees and Will Appeal

[Our Correspondent] Xie Baosheng, former Deputy Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Police Department under the puppet regime, was sentenced yesterday by the High Court to two and a half years of imprisonment, deprivation of civil rights for three years, and all his property confiscated except for what is deemed necessary for the living expenses of his family.

Xie is a "celebrity" in Shanghai's underworld, running businesses such as the Xianle Dance Palace, the Kade Bathhouse, and the Xinzha Hotel. He is also known as "Ma Fu Baosheng" (Groom Baosheng) because he used to trade horses in the Northeast. Yesterday morning, after reading the verdict, the presiding judge explained to the defendant that because he had some merit in resisting the Japanese, his sentence was reduced by half. If he disagreed, he could apply to the Supreme Court for review within ten days of receiving the judgment. Xie heard the sentence and said "Thank you" to the court, but also claimed that he disagreed and would appeal.

Yang Guangzheng Sentenced to Three Years

Also sentenced yesterday morning was Yang Guangzheng, director of the Shanghai branch of the "Sino-Japanese Cultural Association," to three years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for three years. Chen Fenghao, the puppet Baozhang (local head) of Junwang Township in Taixian County, was sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment. Former Finnish Consul in Shanghai, Hama Ke, was found not guilty due to insufficient evidence.

Two Cases Scheduled for Sentencing

On the same day, the cases of Shen Weiya, chairman of the puppet Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Association, and Ma Le, an informant for the Suzhou enemy gendarmerie, were concluded and scheduled for sentencing at 9:30 AM on the 31st of this month. In addition, the cases of Du Li, a grain procurement officer for the puppet General Power Company in Bengbu, and his translator Lu Falang, were postponed for further questioning.

### Impersonating Police Officers, Seizing Newspapers and Magazines, Clearly Sabotage

At around 11:00 AM yesterday, three people suddenly arrived in a car next to a certain newsstand, jumped out of the car, and, impersonating police officers, forcibly took away the English-language "Free Forum Newspaper," "Millers Review," and the Chinese-language magazines "Democracy" and "Jianwen Weekly," claiming that they were "confiscated under orders." After the police were notified, they sent officers to investigate, but the three people had already escaped without a trace. According to Director Xuan of the Police Bureau, this was clearly sabotage by unscrupulous traitors, attempting to achieve their conspiracies. He added that when police officers perform their duties, they must carry identification documents. In the future, if the same situation occurs, it is hoped that citizens will cooperate and assist, and immediately hand over such unscrupulous elements to the police for punishment according to law.

### Beijing-Shanghai Special Express Telegrams Limited to Three Hours

In order to improve the efficiency of telegrams, the Directorate General of Telecommunications of the Ministry of Transportation has designated that special express telegrams received between Beijing and Shanghai will be delivered within three hours.

### Active Flood Prevention Work in Western Shanghai Being Carried Out by the Bureau of Public Works

Shanghai often suffers from flooding after heavy rains, especially in the western part of the city. The Fourth District Engineering Office of the Bureau of Public Works had proposed a fundamental solution, designing an entire sewer system, but it requires a huge amount of money, about 330 billion yuan. Considering the current financial situation of the Municipal Government, it is not easy to do so in a short time. Therefore, only the most urgent and critical projects that cannot be delayed are being actively carried out. The projects currently underway are: Dredging the east and west Keham of Jiangsu Road, including all of Ham numbers 9, 10, 11, and 14, and part of Ham numbers 5, 6, 7, and 12. Dredging Ham number 15, that is, the section of Fahua Ham north of Zhengxi Road, removing sludge. Dredging projects for Ham numbers 1, 2, and 5. The next priority is the arrangement of drainage pipes at the intersection of Jiangsu Road and Changning Road. The replacement of 15-inch drainage pipes in Wangjia Lane on Zhengxi Road, and the replacement of two 3-inch diameter drainage pipes on the east side of the Gongda Yarn Factory on Yuyao Road, totaling 331 meters in length, have been successively carried out. In addition, the road surface in the Kangding Road area is low-lying. For a permanent solution, in addition to the simultaneous dredging and pipe connection projects, the road surface in that area has been raised by 784 square meters, and 170 meters of curb stones have been added. This project started on the 17th of this month. Unless there are other special circumstances, all of the above will be completed by the end of August.

### A Meeting with "Double Gun" Ma Kun: Heroic, Enthusiastic, and Speaks Frankly, Always Followed Premier Sun, Dedicated to Revolutionary Work

"Premier Sun is truly a great man, a heroic warrior!" General Ma Kun (pictured) said with emotion. Although he repeatedly stated on the phone that he had nothing to say, so there was really no need to interview him, but when Premier Sun was mentioned, excitement finally shone in his eyes.

The "Ma" in "Ma Kun" is Morris, and "Kun" is Cohen. General Ma Kun is also the well-known "Double Gun Ma Kun" ("Two Gun" Cohen). This is an extraordinary nickname, and what this nickname represents is also an extraordinary character: heroic, enthusiastic, and speaks frankly, without any hesitation. Since 1908, he has followed Premier Sun, dedicating himself to the revolution against the Manchus. This time when he came to Shanghai, his hair was already completely white, but he was still vigorous and full of rosy complexion. Looking at his energetic appearance, it is really hard to tell that he is already an old man in his sixties.

He said that since meeting Premier Sun in Canada in 1908, he had never left the Premier. "I often stayed by the Premier's side, watching him work hard to organize those speeches, often accompanying him late into the night. He went to many places to speak, and I was always by his side. Even when he passed away, I was still with him." His voice gradually became serious: "Afterwards, I escorted his remains all the way to the place where they are now enshrined."

He stood up and paced back and forth on the thick carpet, then suddenly turned around, stood still, and said, "But, I will never forget what the Premier said to me not long before his death. He said that our Kuomintang has succeeded in overthrowing the Manchus, but we should also establish a government that is better than the Qing Dynasty, which has not been achieved to this day."

His words reminded me of "Time Magazine". Sure enough, on the small coffee table by the window, a gust of cool breeze was blowing the pages of "Time Magazine".

Ma Kun said that the Premier's words "The revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades still need to work hard" really refer to this point.

"There is another point that you should also tell everyone. The Premier said that China is a new country, so we can take the essence of the systems and ideas of various countries that are most suitable for China's needs, without having to imitate any one country. The Premier said that Columbus took a detour to America, but we can go straight there."

He emphasized the greatness of the Premier's personality. He said that after working hard, the Premier often went out for walks to relax. Whenever he saw poor old farmers by the roadside, he often chatted with them very kindly, asking them what their suffering was, and talked for a long time. "He didn't know that they were talking about politics, he was just sincerely concerned about them." He suddenly became excited and shouted, "I am a member of the Kuomintang. I don't care about left-leaning, right-leaning, or neutrality, I just think that the common people are the most important thing!"

Indeed, this "Double Gun General" is a very straightforward person, but to say that he is naive is probably not true. Perhaps, after being in China for decades, no one should be naive anymore? General Ma Kun does not seem to be a diplomat, so his every careful step made him very difficult, and the weather was so sultry. So, I happily shook his huge hand and walked out of that exquisite and comfortable room with satisfaction. (Ping Su)

### Director of Social Affairs Bureau's Statistics Office Takes Office, Plans to Compile "Wage Index"

[Our Correspondent] Cao Xiaodeng, the newly appointed Director of the Statistics Office of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, took office on the 23rd. According to him, the work of the Statistics Office in the future, in addition to continuing the usual work of the past, such as organizing statistics on labor disputes, will be to carry out a great plan jointly with several public organizations in the city, that is, to compile a "wage index." Today, the Municipal Government's Statistics Office publishes a monthly cost of living index, which is really helpful for adjusting the wages of salaried people. However, how many times the difference between today's wages and pre-war wages is, there are still no accurate statistics that can be compared. As a result, labor and management are prone to disputes over the wage multiplier. If the plan to compile a "wage index" can be realized, then such disputes can be easily resolved. However, wages have various different standards, with thousands of complexities, such as the distinction between staff and workers, the distinction between skilled workers and professional workers, the distinction between beginners and experienced workers, etc. It is not easy to set statistical standards. Therefore, what Mr. Cao said is still in the planning stage. However, it is learned that once approved by the superior authorities, he will cooperate with organizations such as the Shanghai Labor Association to work together. Mr. Cao is a native of Funing, Jiangsu. He served in the Statistics Office of the Chongqing Municipal Government and taught statistics and other subjects at Fudan University. He flew from the wartime capital to Shanghai and has been here for less than ten days.

### Xue Jianqiu Accused of Being a Traitor After Being Released from Kidnapping, Falsely Posed as a Fellow Villager to Hide the Ransom Ticket, Captain of the Municipal Government Guard Corps Imprisoned

[Our Correspondent] The case of the kidnapping of Xue Jianqiu, which occurred in the Housing Allocation Committee a few days ago, and the process of solving it have been detailed in this newspaper. However, the process of how to place the ransom ticket in the Municipal Government Guard Corps is tortuous. The main culprit, Zhang Xifu, and the Captain of the Municipal Government Guard Corps, Fang Baoyang, are from the same village and have a close relationship. When Zhang, accompanied by the ransom ticket Xue Jianqiu, returned from the riverside restaurant late at night, it was already 12:00 AM. So he folded into the Municipal Government Guard Corps and falsely told Fang that two friends from his hometown had suddenly arrived, and because it was late at night and there was no place to open a room, could they temporarily stay overnight in his place. Fang replied that there were no beds here, and Zhang said that it was fine to sleep on the floor in the summer. Fang did not suspect anything else, so he readily agreed. Xue, because he had served as a secret agent for the enemy and puppet regime in the past, was extremely apprehensive and allowed himself to be manipulated, not daring to say a word. It is learned that Fang Baoyang was arrested by the Second Criminal Division of the Police Bureau yesterday and imprisoned.

Also, the ransom ticket Xue Jianqiu was reported by Police Officer Zhou of the Huangpu Precinct to the General Bureau, stating that Xue Jianqiu served as a translator for the enemy Mei Unit and a special agent for the puppet Zhuji Political Security Bureau in Zhuji, Zhejiang from 1942 to 1945. He led the enemy forces into Hengshan Creek, Beifeng Bridge, Zhuji, burning down more than 1,000 houses, forcibly seizing grain from the people for the enemy, and framing our underground workers. Zheng Zhong, the current Deputy Director of the Investigation Division of the Garrison Command, was subjected to his torture. The informant was imprisoned by him for 16 months, and his leg was stabbed, and the scars are still visible. The Municipal Police Bureau is currently conducting a rigorous investigation.

### Another Accomplice Arrested in the Dade Li Kidnapping Case

[Our Correspondent] In the case of the kidnapping of the child Lu Liangyuan from No. 12, Heng An Fang, Dade Li, North Sichuan Road last month, the Hongkou Precinct rescued the ransom ticket in the countryside of Nanxiang and arrested several accomplices. Another accomplice, Shi Qimeng (26 years old, from Qidong), the Fifth District Public Office of the Qidong Refugee Government, has returned to his original home. After being detected by Director Shi of the Kongkou Precinct, officers were sent to Chongming Mingxing Town on the 22nd to arrest the criminal and escorted him to Shanghai on the 24th. It is reported that Shi was once a pirate, and in December 1945, he robbed cotton boats several times in the Chongming area outside Wusongkou. The main culprit in the kidnapping of Lu Liangyuan is still at large and is currently being urgently wanted.

### Enemy Property Review Committee Approves the Return of the Property Rights of Three Silk Factories

The Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regions held its 110th regular meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday, chaired by Zhang Fuyun. Committee members Xu Ji 　, Zhang Zi 　, Yang Xiren, Hu Yunqiu, Xie Haoling, Xu Shihao, Chen Shouchang, Liu Gongyun, etc. attended, and the chiefs of various sections and groups of the handling bureau were present. The following were approved: The Second Factory of the Jia Rang Shou Company was transferred to the Materials Supply Bureau, the property rights of the Hua Xin, Yong Tai, and Long Chang three silk factories in Wuxi were returned, and the Qinyi Xin Paper Mill was put up for auction.

### Low-Rent Housing Department of the China Trust Bureau Plans to Solve the Housing Shortage: Building New Houses First for Public School Teachers and Civil Servants, Currently Organizing Enemy and Puppet Real Estate

[Our Correspondent] The reporter interviewed Mr. Jiang Liang, Deputy Manager of the Real Estate Department of the China Trust Bureau yesterday about the general situation of real estate in the city. According to him, since the victory, the government, in view of the serious housing shortage in various places, has entrusted the Central Trust Bureau to build as many new houses as possible to solve the problem. The city is already preparing for the plan. Once the supply of funds, the regulations on interest rates, and the methods of payment are determined, construction can begin in batches. The first batch will be houses for public school teachers and civil servants, followed by houses for workers and ordinary people, and then accepting commissions from private individuals and organizations to build more exquisite houses. Currently, there are many empty plots in Shanghai, although most of them are in Jiangwan, Zhabei, and Western Shanghai, but as long as there are houses, it does not matter how far away they are. However, construction cannot be completed overnight, and it will take about a year before significant work can be done. The main task is to organize the enemy and puppet real estate that has been taken over. This real estate is handed over by the Enemy Property Management Bureau, inspected and measured, and property registration is carried out, and then sold publicly to fill the national treasury. However, very little has been sold so far, and most of it is temporarily borrowed by various agencies. In addition to collecting usage fees, the bureau also retains the right to sell. In addition, for some properties that were originally owned by British and American people and were occupied by the enemy and puppet regime, after taking over, our side will retain the leasing rights for one year, and after the expiration of the term, they will be returned to the original owners.

[Another report] According to reliable information, the Municipal Government will soon take various practical and effective measures to solve the city's housing shortage. The content of these measures can be divided into two points: Reduce the burden on land to increase land investment profits. Although the specific implementation methods have not yet been fully determined, it is heard that the land tax and various taxes on land transactions and house donations may be reduced or even suspended for one or two years within a certain period. Encourage the financial sector to invest heavily in housing construction and provide low-interest housing loans. It is heard that Nanjing and Hangzhou have already implemented this. Because there is a lot of floating capital in Shanghai, if the funds can be shifted to construction, it will be the most active and effective way to solve the housing shortage.

### From DDT to the Seriousness of Fake Medicine

— Chen Fangzhi

DDT is a crystallization of science and the number one hero in the victory of World War II. It was originally intended to save the country and the world, but in the hands of the Chinese, it has become a deceptive front, which is quite sad.

Recently, various newspapers have been full of articles about DDT. After reading them all, I can summarize their intentions into two points: first, to publicize the efficacy of the medicine; second, to expose the dark secrets of fake medicine. But I feel that their weight is not enough, so I am here to supplement some of my ignorant opinions.

The function of DDT is to kill insects, and its ultimate goal is to prevent diseases. Because most severe infectious diseases are related to insects, their nature can be divided into two categories: (A) Insect-borne diseases. These diseases cannot be transmitted without insect vectors; such as mosquitoes transmitting malaria, lice transmitting relapsing fever and typhus, sandflies transmitting sandfly fever, and phlebotomine flies transmitting kala-azar. (B) Non-insect-borne diseases. From a medical point of view, these diseases are not transmitted by insects, but insects can act as bacterial mailmen, spreading the bacteria everywhere; such as fleas transmitting plague bacteria from rats to humans; and flies carrying cholera, typhoid, and dysentery bacteria from filth to food. Not only that, when troops are camping in the wilderness, the bites of all kinds of small insects, even if they are not enough to cause infectious diseases, are enough to hinder sleep and cause skin diseases. Therefore, the US military used DDT everywhere in the South Pacific to wipe out all insects, which was a great contribution to improving combat effectiveness.

However, the function of DDT cannot be demonstrated by sloppy use. Its method of use must be chosen appropriately, and its dosage must be calculated sufficiently. For example, to kill insects flying in the air, the spray evaporation method can be used, but to kill bedbugs, fleas, lice, and other small things, dripping or injection is necessary. A small amount can be used in a room or a small group, but to kill insects in a large city, it is necessary to calculate a large amount according to its area and volume. This time, DDT was spread by airplanes over Nanjing, but the effect was weak, and gnats were still flying around the streets. Public opinion was not good, and some people even doubted science itself. This is probably because the method used was not thorough enough.

Speaking deeply, DDT is not a luxury item for the rich, but a necessity for public epidemic prevention. To prevent epidemics, it is essential to start from poor areas. It is not of great significance to the overall goal of epidemic prevention for wealthy people to buy a few bottles of DDT and spray them around. Therefore, the crime of unscrupulous merchants who use DDT as a front to cheat money is not enough to send them to the eighteenth level of hell.

The greatest danger of fake medicine is in mineral drugs, penicillin, Salvarsan, and Atabrine. Fake products can directly endanger human life. These unscrupulous merchants deserve to die ten thousand times. These kinds of drugs are life-saving drugs. Even if they are not fake, but shoddy products with insufficient content due to cutting corners, they are enough to endanger human life.

When I was in Chongqing, a friend of mine suffered from relapsing fever. He bought a bottle of Bayer Salvarsan himself, but it had no effect after being injected. Later, he carefully examined the glass tube. The lion imprint on the bottle label was exactly the same, but the half-drop of yellow liquid left after injection did not turn black even after three days, obviously containing no arsenic and being completely fake. The content of Atabrine and Plasmochin is often insufficient, leading to delays in treatment. The counterfeit Ding of Dajianhuang and the content problem of Xiaozhilong are even more absurd. It was prominently reported in the newspapers that China could manufacture penicillin by itself, but what was manufactured was a long-lasting liquid. This level of bragging can be called unfathomable. However, endangering human life is the same as murder. Where is the law? Where are the eyes and ears of the Department of Health!

I believe that this kind of medicine that harms people and cheats money is by no means a matter of social knowledge, nor is it the responsibility of a city's health bureau, but a legitimate issue for the central government. Because chemical drug testing, especially the analysis of drug ingredients, requires equipment and talent, which is definitely not within the capacity of a city in China's current situation. However, the central government's responsibility cannot be ignored. The ineffectiveness of the law, the deception of the people, and the chaos of medicine must not be turned a blind eye to.

### Morning Dance Attracts Crowds, Police Bureau Orders Prohibition

[Our Newspaper] The two establishments on Nanjing Road, East Asia Once More Building and Nanguo Restaurant, have recently been utilizing their idle morning hours to hold morning dances, attracting customers, especially loafers. Upon discovery by the New Administration Department of the Municipal Police Bureau, it was determined that this type of morning dance not only wastes the morning hours but also corrupts the social atmosphere. The heads of the two restaurants were summoned to the bureau and ordered to cease holding the dances immediately. The Laozha Sub-bureau in charge has been instructed to dispatch police officers to enforce the order.

### Children Prohibited from Entering Theaters, Police Bureau Approves Revocation

[Our Newspaper] Previously, the Municipal Health Bureau, due to the prevalence of meningococcal inflammation, requested the Police Bureau to instruct all theaters to prohibit children under the age of twelve from entering in order to prevent the spread of infection. Recently, as the period of the meningococcal inflammation epidemic has passed, the theaters specially submitted a request to the Municipal Police Bureau to revoke the above prohibition. It has been learned that the Police Bureau has received instructions from the Municipal Government to approve the revocation, but infants in arms are still prohibited from entering.

### Election of "Miss Shanghai" to be Held at a Garden Party - Registration Form for Candidates Drafted

It has been decided that the election will be held in conjunction with the garden party. Director Du and Deputy Director Wu of the association will personally execute the event.

### Two Landing Craft Recruited for Commerce, Trial Voyage Successful

The National Merchant Shipping Bureau received fifteen landing craft from the United States. Previously, because the internal equipment of the craft was not suitable for carrying passengers and cargo, all of them were handed over to the Jiangnan Shipyard for modification after reception. More than a month has passed since then. It is reported that two "He" class vessels, with a carrying capacity of 300 tons each, have been modified and were test-sailed outside the Wusongkou yesterday afternoon, with satisfactory results. From now on, it is expected that one vessel can be completed every three days, and the entire project should be completed by mid-August.

### Gambler Zhu Shunlin Sentenced to Four Years in Prison and Fined 100 Million - Expresses Willingness to Serve

[Our Newspaper] Gambler Zhu Shunlin opened gambling dens such as Huaming and Dasheng in Nanshi during the enemy and puppet period and served as an inspector general in gambling dens such as "Hollywood" and "Six Nations Hotel" in western Shanghai. After the victory, he was arrested by the authorities and handed over to the High Prosecutor's Office, which filed a public indictment against him on charges of treason. After hearing the case, the High Court found the evidence insufficient and could not convict him of treason. However, he was transferred to the District Court on charges of gambling. After two trials by the District Court, the case was concluded. The verdict was announced yesterday morning by Judge Ji in the Third Criminal Court. The main text stated: "Zhu Shunlin, with the intent to profit, continuously provided gambling venues and is sentenced to two years and three months of imprisonment and fined 100 million yuan. He also continuously assisted others in providing gambling venues and is sentenced to two years of imprisonment. The sentence is four years of imprisonment and a fine of 100 million yuan." Zhu Shunlin expressed his willingness to accept the sentence in court. It is reported that Zhu has accumulated a great deal of wealth since opening gambling dens, and a fine of 100 million yuan is just a small sum.

### Blinded by Greed, Apprentice Deceived, 200,000 Yuan Brought from the Bank Turns into Counterfeit Currency in an Instant

Chen Xinliang, a sixteen-year-old apprentice at the Sansheng Department Store at 77 Liuhe Road, was ordered by the store owner Hu Shanhe yesterday afternoon to collect 200,000 yuan in legal tender from the Futaihe Money Exchange on Henan Road. After Chen collected the money, he wrapped it in yellow paper and carried it in his hand, walking back to the store. While walking on the sidewalk in front of 43 Shandong Road, a man of about thirty-five years old, wearing a black Xiangyun gauze shirt and pants with a Ningbo accent, suddenly walked over, bent down and picked up a green flowered cloth bag from the ground next to Chen. He then cunningly told Chen that there was money inside, instructed him not to make a sound, and offered to split it with him. Chen Xinliang, being young and inexperienced, was blinded by greed and fell into the trap. He followed the man to a farmer's lane in Yuantaili on Shandong Road. The man in the black Xiangyun gauze shirt and pants pretended to open and read the cloth bag. At this time, a man of about thirty-six years old, wearing a white striped cloth shirt and pants, rushed in and claimed to have lost a cloth bag containing 100,000 yuan in legal tender. The man in black hid the cloth bag behind him. The man in white stripes demanded to see Chen Xinliang's paper bag. Chen did not suspect anything and allowed him to flip through it. After reading it, he returned it to Chen. Taking the opportunity, the man in black handed the cloth bag to Chen, ordering him to leave quickly. Chen then left the alley with the bag, crossed the East Zhongzheng Road, and opened the cloth bag. It was filled with 500-yuan counterfeit bills totaling 100,000 yuan. He then opened his own paper bag and found that the 200,000 yuan collected from the money exchange had all turned into 10-yuan counterfeit bills. Only then did he realize that he had been deceived. He rushed back to Yuantaili to look for the two men, but they had already disappeared without a trace.

Civil Affairs Briefs

### Importance of Reviewing Public Office Candidates Civil Affairs Director Zhang Xiaosong Speaks

In order to implement constitutional government on a regular basis, return power to the people, and establish people's representative bodies at all levels within a limited time, as well as democratically elect township heads, district leaders, and other autonomous personnel, the Central Government attaches great importance to the review of public office candidates in this city. It has repeatedly urged the wide mobilization of citizens to participate in the review, in order to prepare a large number of candidates. Because the more candidates there are, the easier it is to select outstanding individuals, so that people's representative bodies at all levels and local autonomous organizations can be soundly established, which is extremely important.

Judging from the number of public office candidates at all levels in this city, with a total population of 3.5 million, 362 official and alternate municipal councilors, 64 official and deputy district heads, 4,212 official and deputy district people's representatives, and 2,106 official and deputy ward chiefs can be produced, totaling 6,744 public office personnel. If we conservatively estimate an average of five candidates per position, there would be 33,720 candidates. In other words, at least 33,720 people in this city should currently participate in the review of Type A and Type B public office candidates. Since the implementation of the review in this city, only 1,320 have qualified for Type A and only 1,410 have qualified for Type B. There are 1,215 cases of orders for supplementation due to insufficient qualifications or incomplete procedures, which is far from the aforementioned minimum number of candidates, and is a major obstacle to the promotion of democratic politics.

One reason is that this is the first time that the review of public office candidates has been held in this city, and the general public has not yet fully understood it. Those responsible for autonomy should promote it more at any time. The second reason is that the general public believes that they will not participate in this election, so they have not submitted for review. There are also citizens from other provinces who believe that they will have to change jobs and have no intention of living here for a long time, so they are unwilling to submit for review in this city, which is due to a lack of understanding of the review laws. Because once the examination is passed, the permanent qualification of a public office candidate is obtained. If you do not participate in this election, you will be qualified to be a candidate in any future election. Moreover, you can not only participate in the election in the area where you submitted for review, but also if you move to other provinces and counties and obtain citizenship, you can also participate in the election in that area. The third reason is that the qualification certificates are lost, and it is impossible to obtain proof from the original school, the original service organization, and the higher-level organization, so they cannot participate in the review. The Public Office Candidate Eligibility Review Committee of this government raised this point for discussion at its seventh meeting. In order to take into account the actual difficulties, a flexible method of supplementing certificates has been adopted. It is proposed that Type A be allowed to be certified by the district office in charge, and Type B be allowed to be certified by the ward chief in charge. This method is now being reported to the Examination Yuan Examination Committee for record.

When district heads and ward chiefs are elected by popular vote in the future, a large number of candidates will need to be reserved. This government is mobilizing citizens to actively participate in the review in the near future, hoping to reach the aforementioned minimum number of 33,720. The methods are: 1. Mobilize all party and state organs, schools, and people's organizations in the city, and those who have Type A and Type B review qualifications can participate in the review. 2. In each ward in the urban area, at least 50 people must be mobilized to participate in the review, and in each ward in the suburban area, at least 30 people must be mobilized to participate in the review, which must be completed within a time limit.

### Term of Office for Jia Chiefs Set at Two Years

### Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Explains the Reasons for Taiwan Sugar's Direct Allotment
  Sugar Merchants May Be Allotted in the Next Period

Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau recently explained the 7th period of sugar distribution by Taiwan Sugar Corporation as follows: (1) Reasons for changing the allocation method: From the 1st to the 6th period, Taiwan Sugar Corporation directly allocated to the Sugar and Vegetable Association, but the market price gradually increased, and public opinion was in an uproar, which was contrary to the original intention of stabilizing prices. Therefore, the Bureau negotiated with the company and agreed that the 7th period of sugar distribution would be limited to retail merchants, manufacturers, and cooperatives, so as to avoid manipulation by a small number of sugar merchants. (2) Hopes of this Bureau: This time, the Bureau is acting as an agent for the review of sugar distribution, which is originally of a trial nature. The outcome remains to be seen. The only hope is to stabilize the price of sugar and spread the benefits widely, which depends on the cooperation of all citizens in the city. (A) Retail merchants should sell the original packages at 81,000 yuan per dan according to regulations, and retail the unpacked sugar at 860 yuan per jin. They must not raise prices, change the quality, or hide the sugar without selling it. They should also post the approved price in front of the store. (B) Manufacturers of tea food, confectionery, biscuits, canned goods, and pharmaceuticals should reduce the price of finished products proportionally, and should not be complacent with the current short-term interests. They should look far ahead and compete with the low-priced imported confectionery and biscuits to maintain the permanent survival of the industry itself. (C) Hospitals and cooperative members should no longer purchase from retail stores after purchasing directly allotted sugar, so as to avoid unequal distribution. (D) Buyers of retail sugar should maintain order and not rush to buy. Taiwan Sugar Corporation has sufficient sugar in stock, and it will be distributed once a week thereafter, so there is no fear of sugar shortage. Moreover, the price of sugar distribution will not only not exceed the price of 76,000 yuan per dan in the 10th period, but may also be lowered period by period. (3) Attitude towards sugar merchants' petitions: Most of the sugar firms in this city have a long history and should be protected by law. However, after the 6th period of sugar distribution, the association stated that it could not fully sell to the retail market in order to make up for the previous shortfalls, and that the price of sugar in the 4th and 5th periods was higher and had not yet been sold, so the prices before and after had to be leveled out and could not be sold at the regulated price. Therefore, the Bureau had to adopt a direct distribution method. Now that the Sugar Industry Association has come to the Bureau to petition, it only needs to verify the sales situation of the 6th period of sugar distribution, and it can be fully considered. (4) Application procedures for sugar use in other cities: Sugar merchants from other cities who come to Shanghai to purchase allocated sugar should present a certificate from the local competent authority or chamber of commerce, which will be submitted to the Bureau for approval and transfer to Taiwan Sugar Corporation. The allocated price is the same as in this city.

### US Dollar Rises, Gold Price Follows

Gold was initially weak but then stabilized. It opened in the morning at 1,885,000 yuan. Although the Guangdong trading firms were supplying, money exchange businesses seemed hesitant, and the price hovered, falling from 1,895,000 to around 1,880,000 before leveling off. After 10:00 AM, the central government distributed 120 bars at a price of 1,890,000 yuan. After that, the price remained extraordinarily stable. Later, due to the rise of the US dollar, securities firms also had to settle gold accounts for Saturday, and the price rose to over 1,920,000 at noon. In the afternoon, the market was even more deserted due to Saturday. As a result, the closing price was 35,000 yuan higher than the previous close. Gold ornaments also rose to 1,000,500 yuan. Silver ingots and silver dollars remained flat. There was no change in the underground money market, and the interest rate remained at around 1.2%.

Foreign currency was initially weak but then recovered. The US dollar was still uncertain at the opening, once falling from 2,500 yuan to around 2,470 yuan. US prices are still controlled, and the call for inflation is gradually declining, leading to more gold sales for dollar purchases. Due to arbitrage, there was also some buying for storage purposes. At noon, the price rose to around 2,530 yuan. The afternoon was quiet. As a result, the closing price was 45 yuan higher than the previous close. Hong Kong currency was also pushed up by 8 yuan, with the exchange rate at 545 to 555 yuan. Indian currency was at 660 to 670 yuan. The exchange rate for British currency was 8,700 to 8,900 yuan. Transactions were not brisk. The US exchange rate was mediocre and unchanged.

### Stocks Rise Then Fall

The high prices of Chinese stocks were difficult to sustain. Due to the Saturday effect, there was some profit-taking before the close. There were more sellers than buyers in accounts, and the market eventually rose then fell. At the opening, the high price of Yongsheng Cotton Mill was 710 yuan, Meiya 4,900 yuan, Jingfu 290 yuan, Xinguang 285 yuan, and Qinxing 128 yuan. After that, the market gradually became smaller, and by noon, all prices had fallen to lower levels. Yongsheng was at 660 yuan, Meiya 4,280 yuan, Jingfu 250 yuan, Xinguang 245 yuan, and Qinxing 180 yuan. Trading volume had decreased slightly. As a result, Yongsheng Cotton Mill fell slightly compared to the previous close, Meiya fell more than 5%, and Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing also fell about 5%. The medium-sized stocks that were relatively cold were flat, while the smaller stocks made some progress. The old stocks were also stable.

The foreign stocks were still dull due to the low volume of transactions. At the opening, Yisha once rose to 9,700 yuan, but soon fell due to profit-taking. The decline of Chinese stocks near noon made it even more difficult to maintain the price. For a time, supply exceeded demand, and prices fell significantly. Some even had no transactions. As a result, compared to the previous close, Jardine Matheson, Chartered Bank, Steel, and Paper were flat, while Yisha, British American Tobacco, and Aviation fell slightly.

### Public Debt Market Flat

The public debt market was quiet. The supply and demand for each bond varied, and the market price fluctuated. Unified Type C opened at 730 yuan, fell and then recovered in the middle, reached a low of 700 yuan, and then closed at 760 yuan. As a result, it was 50 yuan higher than the previous number. Types A and B remained flat. Type D rose by 1 yuan, and Types C and E fell by 20 yuan.

### The Truth About China and the Soviet Union's Tea-for-Goods Negotiations; China Trust Bureau Handles Barter Trade Not Limited to the Soviet Union

[Our Newspaper] This reporter recently inquired with a responsible person from the Central Trust Bureau about the issue of exchanging Chinese tea for Soviet goods. It was reported that the Ministry of Finance's Trade Commission originally entrusted the Fuxing Company to handle the barter trade with the Soviet Union. After the Fuxing Company concluded its business at the end of last year, the Central Trust Bureau was ordered in early March of this year to continue taking over the Fuxing Company's business. However, the Central Trust Bureau's handling of foreign barter trade is not limited to the Soviet Union alone. As for the exchange of Chinese tea for Soviet goods, the government authorities have indeed been in discussions with the Soviet Union's Commercial Representative, Mr. Shulaev. However, since the quantity and price have not yet been agreed upon, a contract has not yet been signed. If a contract is signed in the future, and the government needs to entrust the Central Trust Bureau to purchase tea leaves, it will also plan to make comprehensive purchases in the production areas, rather than sporadically searching for them in the market. Furthermore, since the beginning of this year, the Bureau has also accepted commissions from the Resources Committee, the Ministry of Communications, China Silk Company, and others to handle barter trade with the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan for coal and iron from Huainan, and etc. The transaction materials that our country exports are salt and bran. The transaction materials imported by the Allied Supreme Command include copper, various equipment, railway vehicle materials, sleepers, silkworm eggs, mulberry seeds, etc. To date, the amount of barter trade is not large. However, railway materials account for the majority.

### Sluggish Yarn and Cotton Trade

Yesterday, the yarn market was sluggish and unable to recover. The volume of transactions was rare in recent times. 20-count Shuangma yarn could still hold at around 1.3 million yuan, but small and medium-sized yarns could not sustain, continuing to decline by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. 32-count and 42-count threads also dropped by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. People's confidence remains extremely low, and the trend is still weak.

Yesterday, New York American cotton futures fell another 100 points per pound, with the opening for [illegible] day at [illegible]. [illegible] new cotton for [illegible] delivery was 29.13, and spot cotton was 33.06. All spot Yang cotton transactions in this port were suspended, because American cotton has been falling for four consecutive days, and also because of the Saturday relationship. [illegible] nobody inquired, so the transaction was quiet.

### Industrial Syndicate Turns Out to Be Just Hot Air

[Our Newspaper] A certain news agency recently reported that major commercial banks in this city will organize a large-scale industrial investment syndicate. This reporter inquired with several leading figures in the commercial banking sector in this city about this news, and they all said that they had not heard of this matter.

### China Tobacco Can Barely Maintain; Average Monthly Production of Approximately 5,000 Cases; Wholesale Price Has Risen 10% Since the Beginning of the Year

[Our Newspaper] This reporter recently visited the Ministry of Economic Affairs-administered China Tobacco Company to inquire about the recent production situation. It was learned that after the company took over the original China Tobacco Factories No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3, it immediately started operations at Factories No. 1 and No. 2. On average, about 40 [illegible] cigarette machines are started each day, with an average monthly production of about 5,000 cases. This includes the Quanlu, Shuangfu, and Zhinan brands. The delivery price at the beginning of this year was about 300,000 yuan per case, and recently it has been about 400,000 yuan, an increase of just over 10%. Taking the Quanlu brand as an example, the retail price per small package (20 cigarettes) is about 200 yuan. Based on the current cost of raw materials and labor, it is not expected to result in deficits, but it is no longer possible to make profit.

### Rice, Sugar, and Salt All Arrived Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] The main food staples such as rice and sugar continue to arrive. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jianghan ship arrived in the port yesterday morning with 1,000 tons of Sichuan rice from Yichang. The Haiwan ship also imported 1,000 tons of sugar from Keelung, Taipei, yesterday. Also, the Haikang ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Lianyungang, carrying 1,900 tons of salt. The salt was originally to be transported to Bengbu, but due to the recent interruption of the Longhai Railway, it was changed to be transported by sea, and then transferred to Pukou for loading onto trains to Bengbu.

### Rice Market Firm and High, Secondary Stagnant; Oil Prices Not Allowed to Rise Further

Yesterday, over 7,000 piculs of rice arrived in the north and south markets. The market for high-quality goods was brisk, and prices were firm. The middle and lower grades were still lacking in transactions and lacked vitality. There was slight interest in high-quality glutinous rice, but the middle and lower grades had no inquiries. Baiyuan stores are selecting and purchasing high-quality rice, but there are still few transactions in middle and secondary grades. Flour retail was brisk, rising by 300 to 400 yuan. Factories are reluctant to open. Retailers are still picking high-quality wheat, and there are still transactions in high-quality goods, with prices firm, up by 300 to 400 yuan. Transactions in middle and secondary grades are still scarce. Bran is selling well in rural areas, continuing to rise by 300 to 400 yuan. Soybeans are balanced between arrival and sales, and the market is firm and stable. Most of the new soybeans are being used to make bean curd, and arrivals are sporadic, being sold as they arrive, with no changes for the time being. Soybean cake is in peak season during the hot summer, and although sellers are firm, sales are not very brisk, with prices rising slightly by 100 to 200 yuan. The Oil Association was instructed by the Social Affairs Bureau today that oil prices can only be lowered in the future and cannot be raised further. Since there were not many goods arriving from Qingdao, no trading was done.

### Number of Brokerages Passing Preliminary Review Will Not Exceed 500

[Our Newspaper] The preliminary sorting work by the securities exchange preparatory committee's subcommittee for reviewing the qualifications of brokers is about to be completed within the next few days. It is heard that the number of those who smoothly pass the preliminary sorting will not exceed 500. It is expected that a full preparatory committee meeting will be convened around next Tuesday to conduct a thorough review of the brokers who have passed the preliminary sorting. It is estimated that in another week or so, the list of brokers can be submitted to the Ministry for verification.

### Central Government Takes Over Cocoon Loans; Interest Rate Reduced to 1.8%

The Central Bank has decided to take over the spring cocoon loan syndicate. Starting on August 1st, all of the syndicate's debts will be transferred to the bank for processing. As of now, the syndicate's funds used for lending amount to 16.9 billion yuan, and the lending units include the China Silk Company, totaling 53 companies. The borrowers were all recommended by [illegible]. The interest rate for fixed guarantees and mortgages was 4.5%. After the Central Bank takes over, it will be reduced to 1.8%. With such low-interest loans, costs can be reduced.

### Severity of Returned Checks Not as Bad as Reported; Usually Around 2-3 Billion

[Our Newspaper] According to news from the Shanghai Clearing House, the total number of checks exchanged by the House in recent days has averaged over 50,000 per day. The total amount exchanged has averaged over 130 billion yuan per day. The number of returned checks has averaged over 1,500 per day, with the amount averaging 2 to 3 billion yuan per day. At the end of June, the market was somewhat tight due to the settlement of accounts by the banking industry. However, the highest amount of returned checks was only over 14 billion yuan, and that was only on June 29th. The percentage of returned checks and amounts to the total amount exchanged is extremely small, indicating that the overall financial situation is quite stable.

### Reorganization of the Clearing House Awaiting Approval from the Ministry of Finance

[Our Newspaper] It is learned that the Shanghai Clearing House will undergo a partial reorganization. The new organization after the reorganization will be a clearing house purely organized by commercial banks and money shops, and its nature will be a completely independent institution. It is heard that it is currently awaiting approval from the Ministry of Finance, and it can be reorganized and established as soon as it is approved. The current Clearing House was originally entrusted by the Central Bank and began handling the check exchange business of the city's financial industry on November 1st of last year. To date, 175 banks and money shops have participated in the House.

### Tallow Slightly Improves

***

### Wood-Oil Sold for 88,000

Tallow prices were slightly depressed last week due to the impact of tight money, but soap factories are in high demand, and there is also demand from yarn factories, so sales are in season. Recently, the supply from Zhejiang has gradually become scarce, so the goods in stock by local merchants in this city can only be sold tightly. As a result, the market has returned to the state it was half a month ago, and even surpassed it. This is especially true for wood-oil. It is heard that in Jiaxing and other places, it has been sold for over 80,000. The selling price in this city also has to be increased accordingly. The prices are: Heben tallow 88,000 yuan, Neiping tallow 82,000 yuan, Duque tallow 76,000 yuan, Degan tallow 76,000 yuan, Ordinary [illegible] tallow 71,000 yuan, and Macheng tallow 70,000 yuan.

### The North Coast of Qiantang River

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng Reports from Hangzhou on the 10th of this Month

The north coast of the Qiantang River refers to Zhapu, Haiyan, and Haining, which is the famous Hangzhou Bay in geography. The eastern major port planned by the Founding Father is also located between Ganpu and Zhapu. The residents here live by the sea, either by boiling salt or fishing. However, they are not the majority in the population, because as long as there is a little soil, it is very fertile and can be cultivated for self-sufficiency. The reporter got an opportunity to investigate the coastal areas and the seawall that is undergoing urgent accelerated repairs.

Muddy Road

On this day, the new rain had just cleared, and the roads were still very muddy, especially when a car stepped onto this Hangzhou-Shanghai highway, it had a special taste. The bumping and shaking were so severe that people with seven or eight years of driving experience could not imagine it. The big pits and sections of muddy soil on the highway made it hard to believe that you were driving on a highway, but rather traveling in a muddy field. The people sitting in the car were thrown very high, and their hearts and organs were constantly vibrating. It is said that when Chairman Shen went, he used some tiles and bricks to pave a little, and Mr. Shen was sitting in a small car, but it was still unbearably bumpy.

Arriving in Haining

It was not easy to reach Haining. We made a special trip to walk around the city. Here, it was truly a scene of broken walls and ruins. Tall houses stood only with a piece of wall, a pile of broken tiles, and one or two charred wooden pillars. No more than two-tenths of the houses were intact. The county government borrowed a room in a civilian house, but when we went, the county government had already moved to Xiashi. There was only a county government office here. The county party headquarters had also moved to Xiashi. The county chamber of commerce was still here. There were a few shops in the city, and a little market outside the city. I asked the local people, and they said: "Haining is getting worse and worse. In the past, all the streets here were very prosperous, and many important people also lived here. There was electricity and newspapers, but now the streets have been burned down. Some families have torn down their houses to sell them, and many rich people who are outside will never come again." I asked them if the enemy had fought in this place? They also told me, "Did the enemy fight here? The enemy wanted to move the white stone lions in front of the Sea God Temple, but they couldn't move them, so they looted a lot of the equipment in the temple."

Children of the Sea

The people here do not completely rely on the sea for a living. The sea is close to the seawall and cannot be used to boil salt. When the tide is not coming, the sea is too shallow to fish. Only a very small number of people live by repairing the seawall, and the rest are mostly engaged in farming. We went to see the residence of the famous Minister Chen from the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. Legend has it that Yongzheng had no son, only a daughter. Later, Chen Yuangao exchanged his son for the daughter and married the daughter to his son. This son was Qianlong, and Chen became the emperor's father-in-law. Seeing his majestic gate and flagpole standing around, we could still recognize where horses were tied and sedan chairs stopped in the past. We walked into the gate, which was also dilapidated. Chen also sat in Haining in the past to supervise the repair of the seawall. In the past, civil and military officials had to come to Haining every year to pay their respects or visit. Qianlong also came twice and inspected [illegible].

Sea God Temple

Then we went to the Sea God Temple. The magnificent palace architecture, the exquisite lions carved from white stone, and the two white stone arches outside the temple made people imagine the prosperity of the past. It can be seen that there is nothing left in the temple now, and even the Sea God doesn't know where he has gone. The old sites of the county government and the county party headquarters were also quite grand, but now only some broken pillars and tiles remain.

Some people say that the county government will be permanently moved to Xiashi, because Xiashi is a commercial center and a distribution center for [illegible] rice. Thinking about it carefully, this [illegible] is not quite right. In the past, the government's reason for establishing the county government in Haining was to control the seawall, because Zhapu has salt fields and Haiyan also has salt fields. The tide is not very strong, but only the tide in the Haining area is the strongest. Many seawall workers in Haining also say this. Therefore, Haining is actually the sea defense gateway of the seven counties of Jiangnan and also the protector of avoiding floods. In the past eight or nine years, the enemy and puppets moved the county government to Xiashi in order to squeeze the people's wealth, which caused the seawall to be neglected and almost caused a catastrophe. Now that the county government is moving to Xiashi again, this is really a matter worth considering!

Tide Watching Place

We also went to the tide watching place in Haining. There is a tide watching pavilion, a tide watching platform, and several iron oxen. The tide watching dike has a viewing platform that is more than ten feet long. There are ruins of parks on both sides of the tide watching pavilion. According to the local people, when the tide rises, there are really crowds of people here, and some even rent houses to live in before the tide rises. It is said that foreigners came to Haining to watch the tide. The pre-war legal tender spent in Haining was estimated to be over 10 million yuan, which is comparable to the peak seasons of West Lake in spring and autumn.

Repairing the Dike

We came out of Haining and arrived at the "Du Gao Zhong Li" dike in the east. The brushwood dike here is almost completed. The engineers told me: After the brushwood dike is completed, the collapsed stone dike in front will be demolished, and a new stone dike will be repaired this winter. We saw farmers, both men and women, old and young, carrying mud to make earth dikes and cutting wood to make brushwood dikes, working very hard. I asked a farmer who was cutting wood, "How much flour can you get every day?" He said, "Nine catties, which is worth only 300 yuan." I also asked the supervisor of the Relief Administration, who was supervising the work, and he said, "We give flour based on work efficiency. It takes seven catties to plant a piece of wood, and each person can make two pieces of wood a day, so they can get fourteen catties of flour." We came back from the stone dike and saw a group of farmers having lunch on the construction site, eating rice and a dish of pickles.

New Mud Dike

Arriving at the "Ying Huan Gong Guo" numbered dike, the newly built mud dike there was washed away. Then we went to the "Hui Han Hui," "Gan Wu Ding," and "Duo Shi Ning Jin Chu" numbered dikes near Chen Wengang on the Haiyan side. Some were moving to repair small parts of the unfinished mud dikes. However, according to the engineers, "The mud dike can only block weak tides, so a layer of brushwood dike must be built in front of the mud dike, and a stone dike in front of the brushwood dike, which is even safer. But now to repair the stone dike, rapid development is not allowed, so we can only get the brushwood dike done first." However, the large master's brushwood has not yet arrived, and the piles of very few brushwood are not enough for anything. And the fifteenth of July is coming soon, and we, the people of Jiangnan, should pay close attention to this matter.

Haiyan City

We did not go to Haiyan City, but we knew that Haiyan was also destroyed by the enemy near Haiyan. Most of the local people are still engaged in farming, and fishing and salt are also their side jobs. The same is true for Zhapu and Pinghu. I inquired with many knowledgeable people there, and they all agreed that the center of gravity of the seawall is indeed in the Haining area. If the Haining area is not protected, then Jiangnan will become a swamp. So I asked them for the reason why I thought Haining should be the county seat, and they also thought it was an absolute reason.

Car Overturns

On the way back, I thought about the meaning of "Jiangnan is rich, the world is rich," and people across the country should pay attention to the importance of returning to the seawall. How can we make the seawall never collapse and ensure the prosperity of Jiangnan? We should move the Haining county government back to Haining and engage in reconstruction.

When we were about seven kilometers away from Haining, the mud road collapsed, and our car overturned. I suffered a slight injury that didn't matter, but the chief engineer of the Seawall Repair Committee, Feng Dan, was injured.

Weekend Forum

### Save the Rural Areas!

— Xia Gaobo

1. We Are Ashamed to Call Ourselves an Agricultural Nation

We have always proclaimed ourselves an agricultural nation.

Our country is located in the temperate zone, with suitable temperatures, and the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins are fertile lands, making them ideal for agriculture. Yu the Great managed the waterways and cultivated over 900 million mu of land. At that time, the population was just over 13 million, with an average of nearly 70 mu per person. Mencius said that during the Xia Dynasty, one farmer was allotted 50 mu, which was very possible at that time. Today, although the average cultivated area per person is not as large as in ancient times (details later), according to general statistics, at least 75% of the national population are farmers (some say 85%). Therefore, the phrase "agricultural nation" does not seem incorrect.

However, if we compare our country's "cultivation index" and "average acreage per person" with those of other countries, we truly feel ashamed to call ourselves an "agricultural nation." The "cultivation index" is the percentage of cultivated land in relation to the total national area, and the "average acreage per person" is the average acreage of cultivated land divided by the total population. Let's compare it with other countries in a table:

(Country) (Cultivation Index) (Average Acreage per Person)

Denmark 61.2% 12.4 mu

Poland 48.6% 10.0 mu

India 45.9% 8.1 mu

Germany 43.7% 5.2 mu

France 41.8% 9.0 mu

England 23.8% 2.0 mu

United States 18.0% 19.3 mu

Canada 2.5% 40.0 mu

China 15.4% 3.4 mu

We call ourselves an agricultural nation, but our cultivation index is far lower than that of industrial countries. As for the "average acreage per person," it is only higher than that of England; it cannot compare with the others. However, it should be noted that England's population density is also higher than China's, so the average acreage per person is naturally lower. Our country has vast land and a sparse population, so the low "average acreage per person" is truly unexpected.

According to a survey by the former Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, the increase in abandoned farmland in our country from 1914 to 1918 is shown in the table below:

(Year) (Acreage)

1914 358,225,867 mu

1915 404,369,948 mu

1916 390,361,021 mu

1917 924,583,899 mu

1918 848,935,748 mu

In a country that calls itself an agricultural nation, the amount of abandoned farmland has increased by over 136% in five years. Although precise statistics are not available for recent years, continuous warfare, occupied territories, farmers leaving their homes, enemies looting at will, arson, and exorbitant taxes have naturally led to an increase in abandoned farmland.

In this light, it is no wonder that the import surplus of foreign rice increases year by year, and once foreign rice is smuggled in, we will taste the bitterness of soaring grain prices. We are truly ashamed to call ourselves an "agricultural nation" and are extremely apprehensive!

2. The Rural Areas During the Eight-Year War of Resistance

The War of Resistance seems to have spurred progress in various aspects, but it seems to be an exception for the rural areas. Farmers are the great heroes of the victory in the War of Resistance. The Chairman said in his broadcast speech celebrating the victory last year: "During the long years of this War of Resistance, the replenishment of troops and the burden of national war expenses have largely fallen on the shoulders of the farmers." The War of Resistance is victorious, but the farmers are on the verge of bankruptcy because of it.

First, Exorbitant Taxes and Fees and the Increase in Abandoned Farmland: It is undeniable that abandoned farmland increased year by year during the War of Resistance. Warfare and unrest made it impossible to live in peace, and rising prices and huge costs naturally affected cultivation. In addition, in the recovered areas, the enemy and their puppets exploited at will during the occupation, in addition to land taxes, there were Baojia levies, defense levies, "voluntary" contributions, military rations, departure fees, comfort fees, "Imperial Army" hospitality fees…a wide variety of fees, coupled with "grain control" and forced requisition of military rice, forced farmers to unwilling to cultivate. The Taihu Lake area, famous for its silk production, could no longer afford to raise silkworms during the occupation due to the high cost of labor, charcoal, and insufficient funds. They even chopped down mulberry trees to sell for money and eat. Furthermore, bamboo forests and mulberry trees were cut down because the enemy feared that they would be used to hide soldiers. In the free areas, there were also many exorbitant taxes and fees during the War of Resistance. Various public grains and military and political funds emerged one after another, and military rice was often forcibly bought at low prices. Naturally, the abandoned farmland increased. After the victory, it was expected that there would be a respite, but the exorbitant taxes and fees did not change. It is reported that in Xiaoyue Township, Shangyu, Zhejiang, the situation is as follows: Last December, there were items such as Allied Victory Public Bonds, special professional fees from the county government, old debts for military and public food, township expenses and public grain, raising funds to purchase military grain, the town's fund for purchasing equipment, the central national school fund, and training and expenses for the security team, etc. An ordinary household had to pay 972 yuan in national currency and 107 catties of white rice. This January, there were items such as military and public food for the 32nd year of the Republic, township-level public grain for the 33rd year of the Republic, the first phase of demobilization expenses, the price difference for purchasing wood for the Hao-Sheng highway, and additional gun purchase fees, etc. An ordinary household had to pay 1440 yuan in national currency and 104 catties of white rice. In February, there were items such as losses from purchasing military grain, military and public warehouse grain, town expenses, entertaining garrison troops, and purchasing non-staple food, etc. An ordinary household had to pay 84 catties of white rice (the amount allocated to each household above is calculated according to the number of family members). Of course, there were also expenses in March and April. This is just one example, but similar situations are common everywhere. The poor villagers cannot bear such numerous items and heavy burdens, but they not only dare not speak out but also dare not be angry. This is a serious problem!

Second, Crude Fertilizers and Lack of Agricultural Tools: The second serious problem during the War of Resistance was the widespread lack of agricultural tools and the crudeness of fertilizers. For thousands of years, there has been no improvement in agricultural methods in our country. The fertilizers used are still mainly soybean cake, human manure, animal manure, ditch mud, and aquatic plants. With the war, prices rose daily, and soybean cake and human manure were beyond the means of the poor. Animal manure was too expensive due to labor costs, and there was no time to collect it, so most farmers had to use ditch mud and aquatic plants. Naturally, the output decreased sharply. Many places have also changed to planting miscellaneous grains and vegetables because of this. The lack of agricultural tools is also a serious problem. According to Mr. Hong Ping's statistics in the Economic Weekly: "In Yi and other areas, approximately one cow was shared by two and a half farm families. Now, it is difficult to find one cow for five families. In the rural areas of Nanling, Xuancheng, Dangtu, Fanchang, and Jingxian in southern Anhui, there was one cow for every three or four families before the war, but now there is only one cow for every thirty or forty families." (See Economic Weekly, Volume 1, Issue 8). This is also a very common phenomenon. The reasons for this are: first, poor farmers have no funds to buy them; second, they are easily stolen. As for other plows, harrows, and waterwheels, they are too expensive, so people make do with what they have. In addition, labor is expensive, so cultivation is done carelessly. After the victory, everything was expensive, and prices rose wildly, so it was naturally not the time to purchase agricultural tools.

Third, The Gradual Decline of Major Agricultural Products: Mr. Liu Dajun once conducted a survey and compiled a "crop index" (which is the percentage obtained by adding up the area occupied by various crops in a year and dividing it by the total area of farmland). He found that the area of rice fields in our country has been gradually decreasing. The pre-war rice import surplus also suggests that this trend is credible. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the erosion of land, high costs, and annual decline in both the occupied areas and the rear areas were particularly concerning. In the occupied areas, the enemy occupied land, implemented grain control, and changed to planting miscellaneous grains and vegetables. The production of cotton in Pudong also declined year by year due to price controls, as planting miscellaneous grains and vegetables was more profitable than planting cotton. In the free areas, the average output was 352 catties, but after 1940, the average output per mu decreased to 265 catties. Cotton production also declined due to the control of the cotton market. Taking Shaanxi, the province with the highest cotton production in the country, as an example, the estimated production in 1935 was about 800,000 dan, but after 1944, the annual production was only about 300,000 dan. After the victory, although there was no more control, many other reasons have not been resolved, and the capital problem is even more serious than before, so it is probably not unfounded to worry that the increase in major agricultural products will be difficult to achieve in the future.

Fourth, The Disappearance of the Spirit of Thrift: Farmers in our country have always possessed the virtues of thrift, diligence, and hard work. During the War of Resistance, prices rose daily, and maintaining a livelihood and safeguarding wealth could not be accomplished by mere thrift. Farmers were not good at trading and did not expect wartime economics to be like this, so they suffered greatly. Over the years, the clever ones have long changed careers to become "shuttle traders," or work as "shuttle traders" part-time, while the foolish ones keep working to death, and that's their fate. In addition, due to unrest, exorbitant taxes and fees, and the daily devaluation of currency, what is saved today is not as good as what is spent yesterday, so life is difficult, but people do not pay much attention to money. In addition, since it is difficult to work hard, gambling and idleness are everywhere, and the steady and thrifty style has disappeared invisibly. Unscrupulous people take risks and become thieves; the ignorant are easily incited and are used by others. The current environment has not improved, and it is probably not yet possible to talk about reviving diligence and thrift.

The War of Resistance is victorious, but the farmers are also on the verge of bankruptcy. Although we are not worthy to call ourselves an agricultural country, it is a fact that more than 75% of the population are farmers. What a serious problem the failure of the rural areas will be! The proverb says that there will inevitably be a bad year after a major war. Although popular sayings are not necessarily to be believed, the climate in the Yangtze River area is warm in winter, with no snowfall, and the inland is not cold either. In addition, the various unfavorable conditions for rural areas during the War of Resistance have not been completely resolved with the victory, and the future is not optimistic. This is true. Without the revival of the rural areas, economic construction cannot be discussed, and becoming an industrialized country is even more of a dream. Therefore, we must raise this urgent appeal: Save the rural areas!

3. The Development of Agricultural Credit Cannot Wait

Looking at the current rural problems in China with a far-sighted and thorough perspective, to address the fundamental issue, we must of course start with solving the land problem. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said: "If we want to increase food production, we must enact laws to encourage and protect the rights of farmers, so that farmers can get more harvest themselves. If we want to be able to protect the rights of farmers, and how can the farmers themselves be able to get more harvest, it is about the equalization of land ownership....The farmer problem is truly completely solved, it is to 'tillers own their land'!"

However, the author's personal opinion is that the urgent solution is to develop agricultural credit in a practical way!

It is not to say that there is no agricultural credit in our country now, but that there is no "real" agricultural credit in China now. Talking about the past, most of our lenders of agricultural credit were individuals (farmers' relatives or landlords). Although there were pawnshops, they exploited too much. The interest rates were too high, so the loans farmers obtained were not for future development purposes, but purely for emergency relief, or even to save lives, so they were unwilling to borrow easily unless they were on the verge of starvation. Most loan methods were to mortgage land, and the loans obtained were not for future development, but for life-saving needs, so it was often difficult to repay after borrowing, easily leading to the land being sold outright after being mortgaged, so farmers did not dare to try easily. We not only dare not advocate this kind of agricultural credit, but also hope that it will disappear soon.

As for modern agricultural finance, it should be centered on the Farmers Bank of China. In recent years, the Farmers Bank of China has abandoned commercial finance and focused on agricultural lending, which is commendable. However, we dare not casually flatter its efficiency. First, the Farmers Bank of China's lending method is indirect. According to the bank's emergency agricultural loan regulations, the targets are cooperatives, farmers' associations, and other agricultural organizations, which then re-lend to farmers. Second, even if we acknowledge that the Farmers Bank of China's review of loans is quite strict, it has not paid attention to the actual use of the loans. Judging from past situations, the people who ran cooperatives in the past were not very capable. Village associations were mostly controlled by local bullies and bad gentry. Many unscrupulous people mixed in, used cooperatives and village associations to dominate farmers, and exploit farmers. How can loans lent through these people have good results! As for the truly cooperative comrades who develop cooperative side businesses for the sake of principles and the country, they are not only a very small minority, but also often isolated from farmers. There are also few who can truly go deep into the rural areas. Therefore, heroes have no place to use their talents, and loans lent through these scholars, although harmless to farmers, are also of little practical benefit. This is the reason for the failure of agricultural lending in the past.

Our government has also realized this drawback in recent years, so it intends to rectify and promote cooperative side businesses, pay attention to the increase in quantity, and also pay more attention to the improvement in quality. In the future, this agricultural loan transfer agency should be able to improve a lot, and the key to facilitating farmers lies in this. It is heard that the Shanghai Cooperative Treasury will soon be established. This is an institution that regulates and nourishes cooperative finance, and it is the central bank of cooperatives. We have great expectations for it.

It is certainly good if cooperatives do a good job in transferring agricultural loans, but unfortunately, cooperative side businesses are too uncommon today, and there are too few cooperatives in the countryside. A small number of cooperatives cannot complete this major mission. In this interim period, since the Farmers Bank of China itself realizes that it has not yet penetrated deep into the rural areas, the author's personal opinion is that it may be advisable to simultaneously invite postal remittance bureaus in various villages to transfer loans to make up for the current shortcomings.

The author has described many shortcomings of our rural areas in the previous paragraphs, among which the most important is that there has been no improvement in farming methods for thousands of years. In other words, agricultural tools are outdated, fertilizers are simple, technology is not refined, and seeds are not good. If this continues, tea, silk, and tung oil will not meet export standards, and none of the rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains can fully meet the needs of the people. This is the most dangerous thing. Today, the Farmers Bank of China is not confident in directly handling agricultural loans, and indirect handling of agricultural loans has not been satisfactory. On the other hand, farmers everywhere are in dire need of help, and there is a famine all over the country. The stability of foreign exchange is completely dependent on the large export of agricultural products. Now that American experts from the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation have come to China, why doesn't the Farmers Bank of China make efforts in improving agricultural tools, seeds, fertilizer manufacturing, experimental planting, etc. to save the farmers in dire straits?

Our farmers have too little knowledge and too little financial resources. They cannot talk about improving agricultural tools, fertilizers, seeds, and technology. They are not qualified to shoulder this mission. It is most ideal for the Farmers Bank of China to launch this task. We should not expect too much and should not immediately think about fully mechanizing agriculture. We should improve step by step based on reality. Set up our own factories to manufacture fertilizers, and use the lever principle to transform the clumsy wooden waterwheels into iron ones, so that the old cows can also expend less effort while accelerating the water flow. Organize experimental farms to improve seeds and planting methods. The author has a friend who is an agricultural expert. He and his family cultivate their own land in Pudong, abandoned his Western-style suit, and went deep into the countryside. He discovered the poor quality of the seeds of nearby farmers, the waste of their sowing and the obstacles to seed development, their untimely application of fertilizer, their helplessness in the face of insect pests, and their neglect of the use of fallow periods. So he painstakingly taught them one by one. As a result, it was proven that the new methods were indeed satisfactory, so they were prosperous. These and those things, the author believes, are not difficult, and the effect is very high. Assuming that similar experimental farms for guiding farming are widely introduced into rural areas, and after truly integrating with the farmers, we can also use this to promote agricultural loans, lend them money, teach them methods, and rent agricultural tools to them. In the author's personal view, this is truly beneficial to the relief of rural areas, and this is a kind of agricultural loan that is beneficial to the country. If we use superficial relief methods, forcibly giving farmers in rural areas a few suits or even lipstick and high heels, it can be said that we are barking up the wrong tree, and the more we try to save them, the worse it gets. Farmers everywhere are indeed in dire straits. They need help, and they need this kind of real help!

Fiction

### Tian Tarou (Tian Taro)

— Chi Zhao

In late autumn, the west wind swept up the fallen leaves in the campus. Ever since I arrived here, the sky has always been so gloomy, with the rain falling in small drizzles: intermittent, drizzling, as if there would never be a sunny day.

Tonight, I was awakened again by that singing. Although I don't understand what they are singing, the tone, both tragic and desolate, always allows me to understand the singer's heart. The sound of raindrops drips in my ear, further stirring my thoughts.

Our school is a three-story western-style building, with a playground and campus. During the occupation, it was seized by the Japanese and used as a ×× facility. After the victory, we reclaimed a portion of the second floor, but the rest is still occupied by Japanese nationals awaiting repatriation. Among them are high-ranking figures, professors, students, small merchants, and more, mostly intellectuals. The school, fearing unforeseen events in the future, first sent me to oversee the school building. Since I arrived, I have become their master.

They always show a self-deprecating, polite, and submissive attitude towards me. When meeting or talking to them, they always bow at a ninety-degree angle. However, their silence, perseverance, and humility make me feel doubtful and fearful, especially when I think about the impression the Japanese soldiers left on me during the war: square, cold faces, squat torsos, and clumsy, heavy footsteps. The grotesque faces, crude behaviors, and painful memories involuntarily appear in my mind, and I truly feel like I am in the realm of ghosts. So, at first, I always kept a weapon under my pillow while sleeping, in case of an accident.

That singing mostly comes from a corner on the third floor. I know they often drink alcohol and start singing in the middle of the night. Every time it wakes me up, it causes me unease. The more I think about it, the more afraid I become. Several times I mustered the courage to yell at them, and only then did they fall silent. Tonight, I think I can't let them continue like this every day. Tomorrow, I must negotiate with Tian Taro and stop their nighttime singing.

Tian Taro is the leader of the Japanese residents living in the school. I heard that he used to be an important figure. Several Japanese people live in each classroom in the school building, but he and his wife occupy a large room on the third floor all to themselves. His wife is a White Russian named "Lucy Chuanzi." I think it is a strange Japanese-Russian combination of names.

Tian Taro has the typical short, stout body of a Japanese person, with a pair of small, shiny black eyes, and a mustache like a "Jintan" (medicine) advertisement on his lip. His face doesn't show much expression, and his smile seems forced. He is about forty years old. He can speak English, Mandarin, and Shanghainese. He also likes to drink alcohol and falls asleep after drinking, sprawling on the tatami like a confused person. But the other Japanese residents bow and greet him, every day. He never "drunkenly sings."

He sometimes gathers the resident Japanese, or groups of students, for meetings. They all seem to respect him very much. Although I don't understand Japanese, their contemplative and tense expressions, and Tian Taro's agitated and trembling tone, always make me feel suspicious and afraid. However, every household has a Chinese national flag hanging, and some even have portraits of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek.

The students living on the second floor spend all day quietly reading books. Tian Taro or other professor-like figures sometimes take it out on them when they are drunk, and the students always seem to be receiving severe lessons. When they say a word, the students bow and respond: "Yes," not daring to retort even once. Sometimes they even pull their hair or shake their shoulders, but they don't resist, which I find incredible.

I don't have good feelings towards Japanese people. I should press them to relocate. Because Tian Taro is their leader, I have more opportunities to contact him. He is always so humble and submissive towards me, his expressionless face always wearing a smile, which often makes me unable to get angry. However, in front of the Japanese residents, he is haughty and stern.

He once said that I was lonely, and sometimes invited me to drink alcohol upstairs. At first, I refused him several times, but later I couldn't resist his repeated bows, so we gradually became familiar from the starting point of drinking alcohol, and my suspicion and hatred towards them also disappeared.

In our conversations, I always wanted to find out Tian Taro's views on this war, but he always darted his black eyes and changed the subject. I also asked him about his prospects for our country's future, but he often looked out the window—the window was gloomy and raining. Once, I asked too closely, and he forced a smile and said: "You, people from Shanghai, called us 'Eastern gentlemen' during the war, but now you call us 'Eastern devils.' In the future, uh..." He paused for a moment, "In the future, I don't know how you will call us." His words really stung me a little.

I remember one time, an officer from the × unit came and wanted to use the school building to station troops, wanting to drive them away. Tian Taro rushed to find me. For the purpose of my arrival and the sovereignty of the school, I stepped forward and negotiated with that officer. As a result, because the facts were all on my side, and that officer was also from my hometown, he dismissed the idea. But when he left, he drove away their ×× facility's car. He came to ask me for help again. I knew that negotiation was a waste of time, so I refused him. He then said with indignation: "Your country is still like that!" I don't know if he regretted his slip of the tongue. Then he changed his face and politely chatted with me, which really made me unable to understand his psychology.

Tian Taro, in my eyes, is such a person!

The next day, I woke up, and the sky was still not clear. I took the opportunity to run to Tian Taro's room, wanting to negotiate with him about last night's matter. His room seemed particularly quiet. Lucy Chuanzi was also sitting silently with her knees bent, nodding when she saw me. Tian Taro showed his expressionless "smiling face" to greet me:

"Ohayo, (Good morning) ×-san (Mr.), please sit down."

I made small talk and told him my intentions. He said seriously:

"×-san, yes, yes, I will stop them, but they are also singing because they are too bored." His eyes darted for a moment and then said: "However, the order has been issued, and this batch of us will be sent back to our country the day after tomorrow." After he finished speaking, he handed me a cigarette and lit one himself, inhaling it wildly. The room fell silent immediately, and Lucy Chuanzi seemed even more dazed. I felt that the air was too stifling, so I excused myself. As I was leaving, Tian Taro broke the silence and said:

"×-san, tonight, please come to drink alcohol, will you give me the honor!"

After drinking alcohol at Tian Taro's place, I walked back to my room. The night rain was drizzling. I thought about the scene just now and felt a little lost. As I was cleaning up to go to bed, I suddenly heard a knock on the door.

I opened the door, and unexpectedly, Lucy Chuanzi rushed in, carrying a handbag. With red eyes, she said to me in English:

"Mr. ×, Tian Taro wants to drive me away, saying that he can't take me back to his country. Although he gave me all the jewelry and money, I am still reluctant to leave him, and where can I go? Mr. ×, please speak to him for me, thank you." After speaking, she wiped her face with a handkerchief.

I sympathized with her, and I walked out of the room. Everything outside was quiet. The other Japanese people didn't seem to be affected by this matter. I walked to Tian Taro's residence. The door was locked. I knocked on the door. At first, there was no sound. I knocked harder, and then I heard Tian Taro's reply:

"×-san, this is my country's and my own business. I can't take Chuanzi back. Please don't interfere in our affairs."

After that, no matter how much I said outside the room, there was no reply. I walked down and told Lucy Chuanzi with an apologetic attitude. She could only sigh, and we both fell silent.

"He has this kind of temper, and he is determined and stubborn in doing things. I also know that he doesn't not love me, but it's raining, where can I go at night?" She started to say, "Mr. ×, can you let me spend the night in your room?"

For fear of accidents, I had to gently refuse her.

"Then, Mr. ×, please help me call a rickshaw, okay? Thank you," she then changed her mind and said.

I agreed to her, put on my raincoat, and walked out of the school with her, carrying her handbag.

"Miss Chuanzi, where do you want the rickshaw to go?" I asked.

"Oh: this..." Lucy Chuanzi said blankly, "I also have no purpose. Let me think about it in the car, just please help me call a rickshaw, thank you."

The car came, she sat on it, I gave her the suitcase, she held my hand, which made me unable to remain silent.

"Mr. ×, goodbye, thank you," she said, directing the rickshaw driver to move forward.

Raindrops fell on my face, and I was startled to wake up. Her car also drove far away, and I quietly walked back to the school. Everything was still quiet.

On the third morning, it was still raining. Those Japanese residents were packing their luggage. I had gone to visit Tian Taro. The door of the room was ajar, and he was still lying on the tatami, asleep. The room was messy, and I didn't want to wake him up, so I walked down.

In the afternoon, when they set off to the assembly point, Tian Taro seemed to have come to see me on purpose, with a somber face and none of his usual smile.

"Mr. ×, thank you for your kindness last night. I didn't want to abandon Chuanzi, but I couldn't take her back to my country, and I gave her everything," his black eyes darted for a moment, "Mr. ×, you are here, you will always have a chance to meet her, you tell her for me..." He said excitedly and quickly, "In a few years, I will definitely come back to your country to find her."

Hearing Tian Taro's words, I couldn't help but be stunned. I felt infinitely ridiculed, and the bad impression that the Japanese people had given me surfaced in my mind. I was about to flare up.

"Sayonara" (Goodbye), Tian Taro walked out with his head held high, not paying attention to my attitude at all, and without bowing to me, contrary to his usual behavior.

I couldn't help but be angry, but when I looked at the sky, it was still so gloomy, and the rain was falling intermittently, as if there would be no sunny day, and I unconsciously dissipated half of my anger. I looked out the window again, and in the drizzle, Tian Taro led a group of people who were proceeding in an orderly manner towards their destination, without chaos or sorrow. It stirred up in my mind again that impression of "square, cold faces, squat torsos, clumsy, heavy footsteps..." and I couldn't help but feel suspicious and bewildered again.

However, the sky was still gloomy, and the rain was still falling intermittently. The sky has been gloomy for so long, and the rain has been falling for so many days, which is really depressing.

"Tomorrow, tomorrow it should be sunny!" I prayed silently.

### Summer Night

— Ming Yi

If summer is a piece of prose, summer night should be a poem. Each night is a different little poem: lyrical, narrative, rational...

At that time, the poisonous flames left by the God of Summer during the day have been driven away by the evening breeze, the human voice gradually subsided, and the moon slowly came up. You may be lying alone on the vast grassland, subconsciously counting one or two... stars embedded in the sky, reminiscing about the past of childhood.

Or you have such good luck to have a close friend together. You shoulder-to-shoulder and hand-in-hand, slowly walking on the avenue lined with straight plane trees, slowly walking, murmuring your wishes. The dim street lights will never come to laugh at your infatuation. The road ahead is an endless plain, long.

Perhaps you are now sitting quietly in a corner of the night garden, silent. Schubert's serenade gently drifts from afar, reminding you of the life of such a young musician, regretting that his eighth symphony was never completed. Or when you silently recite Du Mu's "The jade stairs are bathed in the cool hues of night, I sit watching the Herdboy and the Weaver Maid," you turn around and ask your young friend, "Do you know which one is the Weaver Maid?" She shook her head, so you both looked at each other and smiled.

At this time, of course, you will not like to listen to the plaintive and resentful "Farewell Waltz", but its euphemistic and lingering melody after all stirs your calm heart. You say, "Let's dance"?—When you are dancing, you also seem to be a departing person who is about to go to the border, reluctant to say goodbye. You swirl, swirl, swirl... So, the heat of the summer night disappears in the endless lingering, disappearing imperceptibly like a kitten touching its toes. When she says in a low voice, "Let's go back?" almost everyone has left. You tidy up your clothes, which are slightly stained with dew, and stand up. The setting moon has set in the west, and the stars are also tired and sleepy. The dark night sky wraps the gloomy woods even tighter.

### Returning Voyage (Selected World Famous Paintings)

James Clark Hook was an English painter, born in 1819 and died in 1907. In his early years, he had a passionate love and yearning for the ocean. His first art exhibition was when he was eighteen years old. In 1846, he traveled to Italy via Paris and Switzerland, which had a great influence on his painting style. Hook's works on landscapes and the ocean are widely loved by people.

Long Serial

### Flying Together (98)

— Zhao Qingge

Dong Shaoling also laughed, pinched Lihua's nose and said:

"Yes! I just like to see your smile often."

Lihua picked up Huang Shaoling's left hand and looked at the embedded watch. She hurriedly wiped her tears and said:

"It's getting late, I should go back." After saying that, she shook his hand tightly and looked at him deeply.

"I'll see you off at the station tomorrow." Dong Shaoling said, seeing her off.

"Thank you!" Lihua still smiled and nodded.

Dong Shaoling watched Lihua go away, feeling a little lost. Back in the house, he pondered over Lihua's every move just now, feeling that they all seemed to have a hidden meaning, but the impression was so vague. So he couldn't help but joke to himself: "A person who lives in 'drama' all year round is so used to being entangled and lingering, so don't be sentimental!" Dong Shaoling laughed to himself. He shook his head, clearing away his chaotic thoughts. He quietly picked up the book again.

Lihua lowered her head and walked out of the gate of the Huang Da Wang Temple, carrying a heavy mood, and walked out of Kaifeng, where the yellow sand used to fly! She looked back again and again! Looking back at the winding ancient city walls; looking back at the towering Iron Pagoda; looking back at the solemn and square Drum Tower; looking back at the dilapidated Huang Da Wang Temple; looking back at Dong Shaoling, who was always lying on the desk, handsome and bookish, enthusiastic but indifferent...

[Flying Together]: End of the First Part

When "Flying Together" was first written, it was originally thought that "flying" 100,000 words would be enough to "settle down", but now that 100,000 words have already flown past, the story itself has only gone halfway. The next half of the journey is quite bumpy, so I estimate that it will take another 100,000 words to settle down. This is something I never expected, because I am only a worker in the literary and artistic undertaking who hopes to express a little conscience. I have no big ambitions or ambitions! I have never dared or had any arrogant plans of hundreds of thousands of words in advance, but this time I unintentionally burdened myself with a heavy load of 200,000 words, making it "difficult to get off the tiger". It's a pity if I don't continue to write! It's a bit hesitant to write on! In any case, the first step is to bring the serial to an end. If I don't serialize it, I may still be able to write it down calmly. When serialized, my pen feels the unnatural pain of being spurred by life, and my mood is not as pleasant and relaxed as writing for literature and art. So, I decided to grit my teeth, give up this limited manuscript fee income, and end the first part of the novel as of now, and the second part will no longer be published!

"Flying Together" is a long and complex novel that I plan to write about the various social phenomena in several major eras from the establishment of the Republic of China to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The romance of thirty-five years cannot be written in a few words, but I have tried to simplify it as much as possible! I dare not say that I can definitely write this touching story well, but I dare to say that I am writing it loyally and simply in accordance with my conscience!

### The Knowledge and Morality of Film and Drama Critics

— Tao Xiong

Drama critics and film critics are the bridge between the stage and the screen and the audience. They are also the audience's discerning eyes and the judges in front of the stage and screen! Just think: they bear such great responsibilities!

Drama critics cannot write about what Aristotle said "how, how" anytime, anywhere; film critics cannot write about "montage" in every review; because you need to know that the criticisms you write are not just for insiders, they are presented to countless readers, and these countless respectable readers do not fully understand the jargon. They don't need to know what Aristotle and montage are; they just need to know what's good and what's bad.

We often see critical texts blaming the performance goals of film and drama. Some even absolutely subjectively point out how it should be done. That's still wrong. A critic is just a fair critic, not a reviser. At the same time, he must know whether the scale of criticism he uses is suitable for what the play shows. If people are measuring rice, and you use a ruler to measure it, you can't get a result; if people are measuring cloth, and you use a peck to measure it, you can't get a result either; you must use a peck to measure rice and a ruler to measure cloth to get the correct conclusion. Critics must also stand in the position of the playwrights, directors, actors and all the technical staff to criticize, find out the shortcomings and mistakes from the purpose they want to express, and also point out their perfect things and tell the audience.

I have seen a lot of texts criticizing actors, only saying: "So-and-so performed very well", "So-and-so performed badly"; but where are the standards for this good and bad? Unknown. It is best to be able to cite examples of their strengths and weaknesses, so that others can see them at a glance, so that the critical text can be effective, and not waste ink!

Drama critics and film critics must have rich knowledge of film and drama; they must have unique insights that are superior to others. Because their responsibility is to point out the advantages and disadvantages of film and drama, both the concrete and abstract parts, to tell the audience the advantages that the audience cannot see, and to point out the parts of the play that have not been expressed to these artists, so that they have the opportunity to improve.

Drama critics and film critics must have high morals and an objective attitude. I remember in the 30th year of the Republic of China, a critic in Jiangxi criticized the actors on the stage, saying: "It is best to eat more aspirin before performing." This is too subjective and excessive. If the critic has a personal hatred with the actor and uses this opportunity to vent his anger, then the critic is not qualified to be a critic because he has no morality. To be a critic, you must have the same fair and serious attitude as a judge!

Critics are experienced old horses, and they must lead the audience to the right path; if the critic writes blindly, then he will lead the audience astray. We can't let the audience lead the critics!

### Stagecraft Talks (9) Appended Discussions on Color Perception

— Wen Quan

Recent scholars have quite divided opinions on the explanation of color perception. People like Young, Helmholtz, and Maxwell all advocate the trichromatic theory of color vision. Hering, on the other hand, advocates the opponent process theory. Wundt completely denies both, establishing a stage theory.

The trichromatic theory of color vision originated earlier. In 1802, Young, based on experiments with color light mixing, corrected the old theory of red, yellow, and blue as primary colors, believing that the primary colors of light were red, green, and violet. His hypothesis was based on the idea that three types of nerve endings are distributed on the retina of the human eye. When the first type of nerve ending is stimulated by incoming light, it produces a sensation of red; the second produces a sensation of green; and the third produces a sensation of violet. When all three are stimulated simultaneously, a sensation of white is produced. Also, if two or three of these are stimulated simultaneously with varying degrees of intensity, then the sensation of all other mixed colors is produced. Later, in 1868, Helmholtz modified this theory, believing that the three types of nerve endings each have a specific color sensitivity, but that they are stimulated more strongly by certain colors, not that they are completely insensitive to other colors. The so-called primary colors are still red, green, and violet. Later, Maxwell used more precise experimental methods to prove the credibility of the primary color sensation, but the third primary color was blue, not violet. Most proponents of the trichromatic theory now follow this view.

In 1878, Hering published a new theory. His theory roughly stated that the nerve endings of the retina of the human eye are composed of various visual substances. These are categorized into three pairs. Under the stimulation of various incoming light rays, either a physiological dissimilation process (i.e., a destructive or consuming action) or an assimilation process (i.e., a constructive or replenishing action) occurs, thus resulting in various color sensations. The approximate breakdown is as follows:

Visual Substance Assimilation Process Dissimilation Process

First Black-White Visual Substance Black Sensation White Sensation

Second Red-Green Visual Substance (Cyan-Green) Sensation Red Sensation

Third Yellow-Blue Visual Substance Blue Sensation Yellow Sensation

Color sensations other than the above six are obtained through the combined action of these six. However, regardless of the color sensation, it always causes dissimilation of the first visual substance to some extent, hence there is always some sensation of white light. If the dissimilation processes of the second and third visual substances occur simultaneously and are very balanced, then the color sensations cancel each other out, leaving only the dissimilation process of the first visual substance, hence the sensation of white or gray. (Gray is the sensation of both assimilation and dissimilation processes occurring simultaneously in the first visual substance.) This theory best explains the phenomenon of complementary color mixing, and also explains the phenomenon of afterimages (i.e., after a visual substance has been subjected to one type of process, the opposite process must occur to restore it, hence the afterimage). Therefore, many people believe in this theory more.

(1) All nerve substances have two processes: excitation and inhibition. When the retina is undergoing inhibition, it produces a sensation of black, which is combined with the stimulation of an incoming light to produce various sensations of brightness and darkness. When the stimulus is removed, inhibition continues and the sensation of darkness remains.

(2) When the retina is stimulated by light, in addition to achromatic excitation, there is also chromatic excitation. The hue of the color is changed by the wavelength of the light, and the saturation is changed by the amplitude of the light. Since achromatic excitation is related to the amplitude of light, all color sensations have differences in brightness.

(3) The process of chromatic excitation results in a series of photochemical processes. These processes and wavelengths change in stages and tend to proceed cyclically. Light waves with similar wavelengths have similar chemical reactions caused by their stimulation, while light waves with different wavelengths have gradually diverging reactions. When it comes to complementary colors, the two reactions are opposite and cancel each other out. Beyond this limit, the two reactions gradually become similar again. The process of achromatic sensation is the same in this example, but the change in wavelength only makes its strength different, resulting in a linear change.

(4) Every light stimulus causes both chromatic and achromatic excitation to occur simultaneously. When the light is very weak, the achromatic sensation dominates, so it is seen as gray. When the light intensity is moderate, the chromatic sensation dominates, resulting in saturated colors. When the light is too strong, the achromatic sensation dominates again, resulting in a sensation of whiteness.

(5) After the photochemical excitation is removed, it continues temporarily, producing a positive afterimage of the same color. If the stimulation is excessive and the vision is fatigued, a negative complementary color afterimage is produced. Sometimes the recovery from fatigue and excitation repeats, resulting in rhythmic reverberations.

(6) After light stimulation, achromatic excitation occurs faster and earlier, and its decay is also earlier. Therefore, after a long time of any color sensation, there is a lingering chromatic aftertaste of the afterimage.

The phenomenon of color sensation can be largely explained by Wundt's theory. Wundt also believes that all sensations have emotions at the same time. Vision uses chemical changes as a medium, which can cause extremely complex emotions that cannot be simply generalized as pleasant or unpleasant feelings. (End)

### Cover Girl: Rita Hayworth - Biggest Expense is Making New Clothes, Doesn't Know Housework, Likes to Dance

— Xin Fang

Rita Hayworth, the star of "Cover Girl," has had a meteoric rise in recent years. Since completing "Cover Girl," she has also starred in famous films such as "Gilda," becoming a star in her own right. Her reputation in Hollywood can overshadow that of the old Garbo and the current Montand. Below is an interview with Rita Hayworth by an American reporter, from which we can learn about her life off-screen, or even gain a deeper understanding of Hollywood artists in general.

Q: When you're not filming, what time do you usually get up?

A: When I'm not filming, I often sleep until noon. I don't admit to being a late sleeper, because most of the year is spent filming, and getting up at 5 a.m. is very common when filming.

Q: What is the biggest expense for a movie star?

A: The cost of clothing. Whether I'm attending a broadcast or a charity performance, I feel that wearing a new outfit is essential. A movie star should look like a movie star, the general public expects that, and we can only do as they expect.

Q: Have you ever been discouraged since you started acting?

A: Everyone is bound to encounter times of discouragement. Nine years ago, when I was assigned to star in "Only Angels Have Wings," I was kicked out because my reputation in Hollywood wasn't as good as Loretta Young's. I almost cried about it!

Q: Are you shy in public places?

A: If the people around me only recognize me as an ordinary person, then everything is very ordinary. But when there are idle people, every move I make is their concern. I'm still a 28-year-old girl, inexperienced in the world, so in this situation, my natural shyness often shows on my face.

Q: Which performance do you think was the biggest failure?

A: Playing the unfaithful wife in "Tales of Manhattan" was the biggest failure. This role didn't seem to suit me in terms of age or demeanor, so failure was expected.

Q: What experience do you have in handling all household chores?

A: I started learning to dance at a very young age, and I stepped onto the silver screen at the age of sixteen, so I can say that I have simply never learned anything about household chores. Now I may be more advanced in acting, but I really admire the work of an ordinary housewife!

### Talking about Dance

— Qian Zonglian

Chinese dance symbolizes Buddha, while European and American dance symbolizes God. The difference in the nature and form of dance among different ethnic groups is due to the difference in the objects they imitate. Later, because of social progress and the needs of the people, the nature and form of dance also changed. Up to now, European and American dances are roughly divided into two categories: one is stage dance, and the other is ballroom dance. Stage dance is for dedicated performance, such as Wu Xiaobang, Dai Ailian, and the four female disciples of the Wu family in our country. Ballroom dance is used for social interaction, and can also be called social dance. There are many new types, in addition to party dance, most are dances for couples.

In European and American countries, social interaction is open, and dance is a courtesy for social gatherings and banquets. For example, when girls from the middle and upper classes in England reach adulthood, their parents will hold a dance party for them, inviting relatives, friends, and prominent social figures to introduce their daughters into society and begin social interaction. In addition, when Europeans and Americans encounter banquets and receptions, they often hold dance parties to add enjoyment and to connect with guests, promoting friendship. Therefore, they regard dance as extremely noble and extremely honorable!

The current ballroom dance is roughly divided into two styles: freestyle and standard. The former does not adhere to any form or posture, only requires lively movements and agile footwork, and can be mastered with practice. The latter emphasizes posture, footwork, direction, and everything must conform to the rules.

The standard style of social dance is reviewed and approved by British dance experts. They have specific styles and reasonable regulations for posture, grip, footwork, direction, body twist, tilt, and rise and fall movements, as well as the coordination of rhythm.

Most people who frequent dance halls do not follow the rules, do not follow the rhythm, and just dance randomly. For this reason, freestyle dancers make up the majority. Even these people cannot dance to the standard of freestyle. Although we cannot criticize too harshly, everything must follow the rules. If you dance without following the rhythm, what is the use of music? If you dance randomly without following the footwork, what is the meaning of dance? Even if you dance freestyle, you must follow the rhythm and footwork, otherwise, you should not enter the dance hall, and the dance hall should be closed down! Because it is not a noble place for social interaction, but a gathering place for the vulgar! Leading pure and good young men and women astray!

I sincerely hope that the original intention of art can be promoted. At the same time, I hope that people who truly love dance must use an artistic mindset to improve the level of dance in our country! Do not let it become low-level.

### Formalism in Acting (Continued)

— Ye Zi

The appeal to the audience is direct and indirect at the same time; it frankly takes the audience as the audience, and also as a kind of vitality of the drama, this drama is to be created jointly by the entire theater, stage, and audience.

By giving people's experiences to the people with sharper and more vivid blows, life and the theater merge into one, the audience is the actor, it is their own drama.

Beginning with the performance of "Dawn" in 1921, it is characterized by constructivism, the dynamics of dynamics, and simplified movements. The application of these two indicates that Meyerhold continues to engage in abstract constructivism, abstract scenery, which, in fact, had already been tried before the revolution.

Many critics of constructivism believe that it attempts to express the mechanical age in the form of scenery. This may be partly true.

Constructivists seek different metals, wood, glass with new usages, to express the purpose of its use, these elements were never used in the Russian theater before. Meyerhold valued the emotional effects that a certain raw material could produce, and the platforms and runways in the scenery of many plays were mostly built of wood and bamboo.

Using powerful movements with abstract rhythm to evoke emotions and convey ideas is as old as art itself. The primitive dances and ceremonies that originated in drama, in which the movements are symbolic, but their appeal to the audience is direct, is based on this. Mechanical dynamics is partly a return to that kind of art, but with modern interpretations derived from Taylorism, and improved by Pavlov's principles of reflex action, replacing the original power of emotion with the psychological and neurological original power of action, this attempt can be said to be new in the theater. An actor at the Art Theater once said: "I make these movements because my emotions force me to do so." The mechanical actor, however, said: "I make these movements because I know that by doing them, what I want to do can be done easily and directly."

Practicing the theory of this movement allows one to understand its characteristics, simplification, abandoning the complexity in the movement that he believes controls emotions, and finally he only needs "pure movement" that is unrelated to the traditional movements that express emotions. This is completely in line with psychology and physiology. When a person pricks his finger or sits on a nail, he jumps up, this is not because it is controlled by emotions, this is only a nervous reaction, nothing else, the tiger jumps, not in response to its emotions, but it instinctively knows that its jump can immediately get what it wants, observing this fact and behavior, Meyerhold discovered a new system.

This theory has acquired the abstract Marx theory in art—replacing the intuitive method of emotion with the practical creation of psychological functions. It is because of this that Meyerhold is close to being a revolutionary leader. (To be continued)

### Reason and Sentiment

— Shao Fu

Two children from a relative's family are studying at the same elementary school. This elementary school is known for its "long history" and "remarkable reputation," and the parents of students are all proud that their children can study at this school. Recently, the end of the spring semester has passed, and the autumn semester is about to begin. Old students who continue to study must register and pay fees. The school has issued a notice stipulating that all fees must be paid off yesterday. My relative was too busy with public and private affairs, and was occasionally careless, so he forgot this important day. When he remembered, it was already the next morning. He rushed to complete the payment procedures, but the school said: "You have delayed paying the fees, which shows that you have no intention of continuing your studies. At the same time, the school has already recruited new students to supplement the vacancies. Now, we can only regretfully inform you that we are full."

In fact, there were many people who asked to complete the payment procedures today besides my relative. Most of them were there because they could not raise enough money yesterday and came to pay today after raising the amount. However, the school officials, regardless of whether you were "unintentionally forgot" or "unable to raise funds," treat you all as "intentionally dropping out of school" and refuse to "make exceptions." When you waste a lot of words, and even say things like "Please help me," the final answer they give you is "There are many schools, you can change to another one!"

Listen, how much pride, contempt, and schadenfreude is contained in this light sentence!

Indeed, the school can freely set the payment date, but as the saying goes, "The law is unforgiving, but sentiment is pardonable." National laws must be based on the principle of not violating human sentiment, let alone school rules, let alone the payment date freely set by a school. The school can stipulate that fees must be paid on that day, but this regulation should not violate human sentiment. First, the deadline should not be set so early, and second, the opportunity for children to attend school should not be sacrificed as punishment. Now, I think it is a violation of human sentiment to refuse students to enroll because they paid one night late!

However, I finally found the reason why the school does this: it turns out that an old student only pays more than 10,000 in fees, while a new student, with the addition of many items, can receive as much as 50,000 or 60,000.

### A Motiveless Murder Case - Mentally Ill Criminals in America

In a Chicago apartment, a woman was murdered in the bathroom. The killer left a message on the wall in lipstick: "For God's sake, catch me before I kill again! I can't control myself!"

According to the police, this is a motiveless murder case.

In the Chicago Police Department's files, there are two other horrific murder cases: a middle-aged woman in a black leather coat walked into the room of a 55-year-old wealthy woman in a hotel and shot her to death. There were furs worth 35,000 US dollars in the room, untouched. This is also a motiveless murder case.

A government official in the Price Administration had his six-year-old daughter kidnapped and murdered. The police believe that the little girl was immediately dismembered after being kidnapped. If it was for ransom, they would never have torn the ticket so quickly. Then, why was this little girl killed?

These crimes are all the work of mentally ill patients. American society is increasingly feeling the threat of mentally ill patients.

A famous criminologist said: "Maybe one of these murderers is your neighbor. One is the waiter who serves you food, or the guy in the car shop, or that beautiful woman at the cocktail party."

### Two Million People Suffer from Mental Illness

Mental illness has become a widespread and serious problem. President Truman recently stated in Congress: "At least two million people in the United States suffer from mental illness; at least ten million people will need to live in a hospital to treat mental illness at some point in their lives."

If mentally ill patients receive proper care and treatment, at least 50 percent of them can be cured and discharged within 18 months. If left to their own devices, that person may spend the rest of their life in an insane asylum.

American judges and doctors unanimously agree that a comprehensive "anti-mental illness campaign" should be launched in courts and prisons. A small oversight may cost a great price.

For example, in a large city, a department store clerk, about 40 years old, stared at a woman on the street and followed her for several blocks. She felt annoyed and reported it to the police on the corner.

The judge fined him ten dollars and said, "I don't want to see you in court again."

Two weeks later, this clerk murdered two police officers.

According to a report by a psychiatric expert, "This person has severe mental illness. For a long time, he has felt that he is being persecuted. After he was fined ten dollars, he concentrated all his resentment on the police. He got a gun, and as soon as he had the opportunity, he shot and killed two police officers."

This clerk's mental illness had been around for a while, his brother knew, his landlord knew, everyone knew, only the people in the court didn't know. And when they found out, it was too late.

There are many examples of this kind. A prisoner, only 24 years old, was arrested 18 times, and released each time. In the end, he became famous for murder. If his mental state had been noticed at any time, perhaps this tragedy would not have happened!

Preventing crime and combating mental illness is an urgent and meaningful task.

### School Affairs

— Xin Yun

Some people say: the way students spend money in elementary, middle, and universities are all different. Elementary school students spend all their money on snacks. Middle school students spend money on snacks and movies. University students are completely different, they save their money for dates with their lovers.

Walking into an elementary school classroom, all you hear is the sound of fighting. Walking into a middle school classroom, all you see are chalk pieces flying around, mixed with singing. Walking into a university classroom, all you hear is high-sounding talk, including politics, news, and love.

Teachers in schools, because their income from teaching is meager and they cannot afford three meals a day, resign from their teaching positions as soon as they have another job. Therefore, some school timetables have more than 30 lessons per week, but in reality there are only more than 20 lessons. No wonder a book that should be taught in one semester is only taught one-third or one-quarter by the end of the semester.

High schools with business majors are the worst for students. Without fixed classrooms, it's one classroom one moment, and another classroom another moment. And there are a lot of empty classes in between. It is impossible to ask students to prepare their lessons during these empty classes. And most of them don't have empty classrooms. So they all just play around idly. In terms of academic progress, the effectiveness is reduced.

Schools with boarding facilities, if you visit them at meal times, you will definitely be amazed. Because almost all schools provide their own bowls, so you can see some people eating with mouthwash cups, some with rice bowls, and some even with steel lunch boxes, truly a mixed bag.

### One Must Have Skills When Buying Secondhand Goods; Being Greedy Must Also Have Limits

— Zuo Qi

Having walked Card Road, and after turning west onto MacGregor Road, one arrives at Wuding Road, a secondhand market as famous as Avenue Pétain.

The gathering of secondhand stalls on Wuding Road dates back to before the Pacific War. Because there were so many refugees, the number of secondhand stalls increased day by day. They bought secondhand goods from every corner of the city and gathered here at night for one last transaction, then took their day's earnings home. Wuding Road already had several shops that bought scrap copper, iron, and wastepaper bottles. Under this mutually beneficial situation, more shops opened, and secondhand stalls gathered here even more.

Gradually, some of the secondhand stalls set up shop here all day long, and business was very good. Because this was the passage from the bustling area to the factories in Western Shanghai, the majority of the bustling traffic consisted of workers and junior staff. The secondhand stalls gained the advantages of favorable timing, advantageous location, and the convenience of people, and quickly formed a secondhand market. Later, the things being bought and sold gradually increased, such as men's and women's clothing, furniture, kitchenware, clocks, and ornaments, it was practically like walking into a department store. They were also very good at adapting to the needs of buyers. For example, during hot weather, they sold mosquito nets and sunglasses, and when it got cold, they sold cotton batting, hot water bottles, and foot warmers. When the Lunar New Year arrived, each stall added many hot pots and candlesticks. Recently, they have also sold DDT solution and sprayers to meet customer needs. However, many people are afraid of being deceived when buying secondhand goods. If they don't choose carefully, they may be subjected to the stallholder's curses. In fact, buying secondhand goods only requires skill, and you won't suffer losses. The most important point is to first determine a rough price in your mind before asking the price and haggling. Often some people argue with the secondhand sellers for a while, and in the end, no deal is made. At this time, the more polite stallholders will start cursing, and the more ruthless ones will gather their gang and force you to buy it. Also, being deceived when buying secondhand goods is mostly due to being too greedy. There is a humorous joke about a countryman who bought a "Swiss Made" gold watch for seven thousand yuan, and ended up being scammed, losing both his money and goods. Although this joke is somewhat exaggerated, similar situations do exist. Therefore, things that are too far from the market price should not be bought, especially goods being peddled.

There are about a hundred secondhand stalls on Wuding Road. Around six o'clock in the evening, when the mobile stalls converge, the number doubles. At this time, people buying and selling things are piled together, which has a great impact on traffic and hygiene. However, because about one or two thousand people directly and indirectly rely on secondhand goods for a living, the police department has allowed them to set up stalls and trade under the condition of not obstructing traffic and hygiene.

### Although There is a Bus Stop, the Bus Doesn't Stop. Why Bother Having a Bus Stop?

— He Ting

A few days ago, I had something to do and wanted to go to Hongkou. I originally wanted to ride my bicycle, but remembering G's tragic death, I didn't dare.

My house is on Avenue Petain, so I went out and headed to the red bus stop at the intersection of Avenue de Collery and Avenue de Sieyes. However, something unexpected happened: five empty buses in a row didn't stop, and there were only three or four people at the bus stop. But the bus just didn't stop, what can you do! Helpless, I had to walk to the Avenue du Roi Albert stop, and the bus still didn't stop. I was really angry, but being angry didn't help. Helpless, I had to walk another stop, to Route Ghisi. This time, I finally got on the bus, but before I could even stand still, the bus started moving, almost causing an accident.

Later, I heard people say: The Avenue de Collery is considered a small stop, so buses don't stop there. You have to run to a big stop like Route Ghisi to get on the bus. But this is really strange, a "stop", whether it's a big stop or a small stop, is still a "stop". It's a "stop" that the public transport company sets up. You can't make passengers walk a long and undeserved way because of the convenience of the drivers and conductors!

### Miscellaneous Poems on Current Affairs

— Hao Xu

Respectfully Presented to Gentlemen Gongzhan, Cangbo, Yusheng, Jianzhong, and Zhen of Shanghai Political Circles

Exchanging letters hasn't formed an alliance yet,
Through twisted roots and complex paths, how many times have we gone?
The air of war is hard to dispel, the people's strength is exhausted,
The common people sigh and wait for the Yellow River to clear.

Salt and iron in the state of Qi have been strong since ancient times,
Huan Kuan and Guan Zhong held the same views.
Exploiting the mountains and boiling the sea is commonplace,
It all lies in the single thought of being benevolent to the people.

Guan Zhong governed Qi by focusing on salt and iron. Huan Kuan's "Discourses" share the same views. Today, Shandong is a key transportation hub between the north and south, and a coal and salt production center, but it is blocked and stagnant, leading to a shortage of food and goods, and rising prices.

Hearing of refugees, tears have long dried,
The image of hell is clearly hard to depict.
When will we happily hear of recovering Northern Jiangsu,
The old and young supporting each other, returning to their old homes?

Crossing the ocean, raising the flag of righteousness,
Fighting arduously, shoulder to shoulder for a long time.
The friendship of comrades-in-arms is enough for eternity,
Having caught the fish, how can we quickly forget the trap?

The American army came from afar, fighting shoulder to shoulder, their friendship is touching. Yet a few people loudly make anti-American arguments, which is truly incomprehensible.

### Sent to My Deceased Wife, Feng Jun (19)

— Zhou Shoujuan

There is one more important thing to report to you, and that is that I have decided to rebuild our main house. Originally, when Zhenhou and his wife, Brother Zan, came to Suzhou to offer condolences during your forty-ninth day after death service, they saw me living in that three-room dilapidated wooden shed, and thought there was a possibility of danger at any time. In the autumn, hurricanes often occur, and this shed, which has no foundation and has barely been supported for nine years, may not be able to withstand it and be carried away by the wind. Therefore, for safety reasons, the main house must be rebuilt. If I don't have the strength, he is willing to lend me a hand. In addition, several friends in Suzhou, such as Zou Jinglao and Zhou Youhong, and brothers Mo Jing, Mao Pu, and Cheng Xiaoqing, also advised me to do it immediately, that it shouldn't be delayed, and that I might as well build it simply. Therefore, through Brother Pu's introduction, a upright and honest Architect Zhu was hired to undertake the work. Because of insufficient funds, it will still be a bungalow, and it will be completed in about two months. In order to use the old materials, it is necessary to dismantle this wooden shed. Therefore, I had to remove your memorial tablet on the day of your sixtieth day after death service, after hiring a Taoist priest. This is another very regrettable thing for you. As usual, I can no longer offer food and vegetables at noon every day, I don't know if you will be hungry? But your portrait is still enshrined, and I still offer you flowers, fruits, cigarettes, tea, and snacks. Every day I still call your name several times and talk to you, just like usual. After the wooden shed is demolished, it will be moved to the study. I imagine that with your virtue during your lifetime, you will definitely be able to understand my difficulties after death, right? Zou Jinglao and others, because I am guarding my home alone after losing you, think it's inevitably too lonely. Therefore, after the twenty-first day service, they invited me to go to the Youth Association for tea and conversation to relieve my boredom every evening. Old and new friends, joking and laughing, really helped me eliminate a lot of the pain in my heart. Sometimes I also watch movies and plays, giving my body and mind two or three hours of solace. But without you by my side, I can't help but feel a desolate sense of loss!

Since you left, my mind seems to have gone with you, I don't know where it is lost. Except for going out in the afternoon, the rest of the time I am always dull and keep company with flowers and trees, and I don't even want to get close to ink and books. My inspiration is blocked, my wisdom disappears, and I can't even start to write one or two articles mourning you or ten or twenty poems lamenting your death, I only feel a thousand thoughts, like a tangled mess. If I don't write, I feel sorry, so I delayed it until the forty-ninth day after death service before deciding to write you a letter and communicate with you through the afterlife. Who knew that if I didn't start writing, it would be fine, but once I started writing, it would evoke all kinds of memories. Thinking of the past and feeling the present, it's all material for sadness and heartbreak. Often tears would fall with the pen, and I would throw away the pen and couldn't continue writing after only writing a few lines. So this letter took more than two months to finish, which is the slowest work I have ever written in my life, how ashamed I am to say it! When you receive this letter, if there are any unclear words, you can ask Rong'er nearby. If you can meet me in a dream, then that will be considered receiving your reply. Because everything can be discussed face to face, and I can tell you all the pain of missing you these past two months. Alas! Feng, oh Feng, I hope that in the near future, you will gracefully enter my dream, show me a new path in life, give me the greatest courage, and let me live well! Feng, I'm waiting for you, waiting for you desperately; come to my dream soon! With leftover thoughts, I wish you happiness and health! Your old partner of twenty-nine years, Juan, wiping away tears with his hand. June 30th.
