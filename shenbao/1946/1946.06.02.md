[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The Ministry of National Defense was established today. At 7:30 AM, the newly appointed Minister Bai Chongxi, a general, and Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng, a general, gathered over a thousand officers above the rank of major at the ministry's auditorium on Huangpu Road.

He hoped that all personnel would work together to accomplish their mission. Chief of General Staff Chen then spoke, briefly stating that the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense marks a epoch-making reorganization of China's military organization. Future national defense will adopt the military system of a democratic country, making the military subordinate to politics. He then explained the advantages of this system: (1) Applying the theories of military theorists Clausewitz and Ludendorff, and analyzing China's Confucian philosophy, which holds that the military is subordinate to politics. (2) Strengthening the connection and unified command of the army, navy, and air force, which will be established with the formation of the Ministry of National Defense. (3) The division of powers of the Ministry of National Defense is in line with the spirit of China's three-branch administrative system, because the power to decide military policy will rest with the Executive Yuan and the Minister of National Defense. Furthermore, the swearing-in ceremony of Bai and Chen will be held during the National Government Memorial Week next Monday, at which President Chiang will preside and deliver instructions.

### Over a Million Jin of Soviet Grain: Left to Rot in Warehouses

County Government Takes Over for Charitable Purposes

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 1st] There are no less than a hundred warehouses left behind by the enemy and puppets in Suzhou, containing countless materials, especially grain. Since the takeover began last September, although it has been transferred several times, it has remained in storage, with no news of any disposal. Since September, much of it has rotted. At a time when grain prices are soaring and people are struggling to survive, abandoning this precious grain to rot is a social contradiction of the utmost gravity, and the people's resentment is extreme. The Second Inspection Team for the Collection of Surrendered Military Armaments and Materials of the Ministry of Military Affairs, recognizing this, has specially approved the distribution of the rotten grain in the warehouses to the poor for relief. Yesterday, it sent a letter to the county government for receipt and distribution, in order to benefit the poor. After receiving the letter, the county government, considering the large quantity of grain, decided that a one-time distribution would only be a passive relief effort, and decided to transfer the grain to a charitable fund for long-term use. It also established a Committee for Receiving and Handling Rotten Grain in Suzhou Warehouses to take charge of proper handling. It is understood that the grain includes 1,146,000 kilograms of rice, wheat, beans, and flour, but unfortunately, it is all rotten.

### Pukou Sulfuric Acid Plant: Lacking Funds to Start Production

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The Pukou Sulfuric Acid Plant, famous in the Far East, is a chemical giant in the north, and the first large-scale industry established in Central China by the Yongli Company before the war. The fertilizer that the plant can produce accounts for 15% of the total output in the Far East. Since the victory, the person in charge of Yongli has returned to Nanjing to reorganize it, and has agreed with General MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo to ship back the large set of machinery looted by the enemy from the plant. Currently, the reorganization work is already in place, but a large amount of circulating capital is needed, as simply starting up the entire power system requires 100 million yuan, and three months' worth of raw materials must be purchased in bulk before the work process can be completed. It is reported that the company authorities previously applied to the government for a loan of 3 billion yuan, which was resolved by the Four Banks Joint Office and handed over to the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications for review, but there has been no concrete decision in two months. At a time when Taiwan and other regions urgently need fertilizer, the prolonged shutdown of the plant is deeply regretted by all parties.

### Trip to Tianjin Canceled Due to Official Business: President Chiang to Return to Nanjing Soon; Visited Wen Tianxiang Shrine in Beiping Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] As of tonight, Nanjing has not yet received the exact date of the President's return to the south. However, it is generally observed that President Chiang will personally preside over the Central Memorial Week on the morning of the 3rd.

### Salt Prices Fall in Various Provinces: Free Sale Permitted

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] According to salt administration authorities speaking to reporters, the supply of Huai salt is relatively small. Most of the salt on the market is supplied by Shandong and Fujian. Now that transportation has been restored and can be smoothly transported, the salt prices in the southeastern provinces have fallen. For example, two months ago, the salt price in Hunan was 700 yuan per jin, but now it has fallen to over 300 yuan, and it may continue to decrease. In order to adjust the salt tax, the authorities specifically formulated regulations, which were strictly implemented. From January to May of this year, it was the first phase. Because the salt tax in the rear area was originally higher than in the recovered area, the tax was 7,000 yuan per dan, while the recovered area was taxed at 4,250 yuan per dan. From June to August, it will be the second phase. The salt tax in the rear area will gradually decrease slightly to maintain the status quo. From September to December, it will be the third phase. The salt tax in the rear area, the recovered area, and even the whole country will be completely uniform. The Salt Administration Bureau will adopt a circulation policy for future salt administration, allowing free transport.

### Marshal Drafts Concrete Plan to Promote Peaceful Reception in Northeast: To Be Presented Upon President Chiang's Return to Nanjing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] It is learned that Marshal Marshall has drafted a concrete plan to promote a peaceful resolution of the reception problem in Northeast China. This news was revealed today by people close to Marshall, who stated that this will be a formal expression of the five-star general's determination to mediate the Northeast problem. It is said that it will be provided to the government for reference after President Chiang returns to Nanjing. Luo Longji, Minister of Propaganda of the Democratic League, met with Marshal Marshall today to discuss the current situation. Furthermore, Yu Dawei, the newly appointed Minister of Transportation, who has met with Marshal Marshall many times in the past, has drafted a comprehensive plan to restore transportation based on the demands of the people of the country and the intentions of the government.

[Central News Agency, this city] According to sources in the Youth Party, Lei Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday to visit Zuo Shunsheng and Chen Qitian, explaining that the Coordinating Small Group may be restored after President Chiang returns to Nanjing and urging the Youth Party representatives to go to Nanjing to prepare for discussions. Some Youth Party representatives are scheduled to go to Nanjing on the 6th, and Lei is scheduled to return to Nanjing this morning.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] A reporter from the Peace Daily here recently discussed the Democratic League's attitude towards the current situation with an observer. According to him, the attitude of Democratic League figures such as Zhang Junmai is still considered fair, but unfortunately, they have failed to grasp the real power of the Democratic League. As for Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, and others, the so-called pro-communist faction of the Democratic League, they are completely speaking for the Communist Party and covering for the Communist Party, which has been known to people for a long time. For example, in the previous Political Consultative Conference, every time the National Assembly issue was discussed, the Communist Party insisted on re-election of representatives, and the Democratic League echoed it. Recently, the Democratic League secretly spoke for the Communist Party, attacking the United States, believing that the United States' aid to the national army in the north was incomprehensible. In fact, the United States' aid to the national army in receiving sovereignty is an obligation that the United States should fulfill to the Allied countries, and it is also known to the people of the country. The Communist Party used violence to obstruct the national army from receiving the Northeast, and turned to hate the United States, but did not dare to openly oppose the United States, so it used the pro-communist faction of the Democratic League. Clear-sighted people can see through it at a glance.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 1st] Observers here believe that the recent speeches by senior officials and generals have clarified the government's policy towards the Communist Party. Now it remains to analyze the Communist Party's ambiguous attitude. They all said that the speeches by Sun Ke, Xiong Shihui, and Du Yuming have clarified the government's determination to receive the entire Northeast at any cost. As for the possible policies that the Communist Party may adopt, there are three: (1) The Communist Party may insist on force to the end, (2) Or it may abandon its demands, (3) Or it may delay time. Everyone expects that the Communist Party, knowing that its military strength is weak and the call for national peace, may not adopt the first policy. The most likely policy is to delay.

### Jiangsu Province's Food Problem: Not as Serious as Rumored

The reporter specifically asked Liu Yunheng, Director of the Jiangsu Grain Office, and according to him: (1) The food problem in Jiangsu is not as serious as rumored. Regarding the stabilization of grain prices, we are currently following President Chiang's instructions to ensure the smoothness of the source and maintain transportation and sales, and have investigated the grain reserves in various counties. All those who have more than enough grain for their own consumption will be ordered to sell it at a fair price and avoid hoarding.

It was resolved that the entire proposal be submitted to Chairman Chiang for final approval.

Therefore, a temporary... road was rebuilt, starting on April 12th, and was built day and night. It was completed in just over ten days and opened to traffic on May 1st. Currently, there is one passenger train running between Wuchang and Qu... and many... trains running in opposite directions on other sections. This completes the transportation artery connecting the three provinces of Hubei, Hunan, and Guangdong. Currently, only a small section of the entire line remains, from Qujiang in Guangdong to Tan... which is being rushed day and night, and it is determined that the entire line will be open to traffic before June.

### Kunming's Speculative Capital Runs Rampant; The Four Banks and Two Bureaus Temporarily Suspend the Supply of Shanghai Exchange; Foreign Cigarettes Are Dumped, Causing Tobacco Factories to Suffer Losses and Close Down

[Our Kunming Dispatch, 31st] The Kunming financial market suddenly appeared hectic on the 30th and 31st. This was because the June exchange settlement was approaching, and Shanghai markets were transferring funds to Kunming in droves. The Kunming Four Banks and Two Bureaus temporarily suspended the supply of Shanghai exchange, causing the Shanghai exchange rate to rise to 60 yuan, which was still difficult to obtain. Although the market was tight on funds, speculative capital was still rampant. The gold market has not diminished its power, but the price is between 1,200 yuan. The Kunming market has now become the tail of the Shanghai market. Recently, fluctuations in various commodity prices have mostly shifted with the Shanghai market. Cotton yarn rises and falls with the price of gold. Transactions in the cloth district are balanced. Daimaru cloth is said to be priced at 125,000, while carded cloth is gradually weakening. Recently, due to the few Shui Ke (traveling merchants) from Guizhou coming to Kunming to purchase goods, the Kunming market has become weak due to the decline in.... The supply of cigarettes is still pouring in, but major dealers are struggling to maintain market prices, so the price of foreign cigarettes has risen slightly, while the price of domestic tobacco remains weak. There were about 100 large and small cigarette factories in Kunming. Recently, due to the dumping of foreign cigarettes and... cigarettes in Kunming, and the excessive tax rate in Kunming, the factories have suffered huge losses, leading to continued closures. To date, only about 20 remain. The once-prosperous domestic tobacco brands "Double Ninth," "Three Sheep," and "Grand Canal" have all been unable to ship due to losses of over 200,000 yuan per case. In order to demand a reduction in the tax rate, the factories have repeatedly petitioned the Yunnan Commodity Tax Bureau. They once planned to launch a march of 30,000 people, but it was called off due to mediation from all sides. As a result of their petition, the Tax Bureau agreed to reduce taxes by 20%, and the factories can uniformly resume work starting on June 1st.

### Labor Strikes Occur Repeatedly in Kunming; China National Aviation Corporation Branch Suspends Work

[Our Kunming Dispatch, 31st] The strikes at the clothing factories in Kunming contracted by the Logistics Department have lasted for over a month and have not yet been resolved. Yesterday, a worker at the First Clothing Factory used a handgun to forcibly demand a dismissal fee of 350,000 yuan from the manager, and said that if this amount was not..., the result would be the manager going to the hospital and me (the worker claiming) going to court. After mediation, the worker.... Also, the Kunming...method... workers have also demanded... for adjusting salaries. In short, in recent months, there has been a wave of demands for adjustments from civil servants, teachers, and workers in Kunming. The reason is that the special prices in Kunming have mostly returned to... status, making life still extremely difficult. People generally believe that since the War of Resistance has been won, they should no longer suffer, which is one reason. Some institutions have higher salaries, leading to cries of injustice. The reason given by... large professors is that the salaries of technical workers have increased twenty times compared to before the war, while their goal is only half or a quarter of that, which is the second reason. There are also many problems caused by demobilization fees or dismissals, but there are still many who take the opportunity to demand higher salaries during the demobilization period when rear area talents are increasingly shifting. In addition, the air crew of the Kunming branch of the China National Aviation Corporation stopped working on the 29th, closing the doors, demanding that their salaries be paid in foreign currency. It is reported that the Ministry of Communications is doing its best to mediate, and work may resume in early June.

Weekly Forum

### Several Perspectives on the Northeast Problem

— Jiang Junzhang

(I) Introduction

The development of the Northeast problem has been truly tumultuous, causing us anxiety, fear, worry, and lament. We know that the Cairo Conference declaration affirmed our sovereignty in the Northeast, and the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance stipulated the specific methods for the Sino-Soviet handover of the Northeast after Japan's defeat. This was the time when the Northeast problem turned from darkness to light. However, since last September, the Communist army gained the advantage of entering the Northeast before the National army, and the Soviet army's withdrawal was repeatedly postponed, so the Northeast problem, which had initially seen a glimmer of hope, was once again shrouded in darkness. When the Soviet army withdrew from Changchun, the Communist army occupied key strongholds such as Changchun and Harbin, and established "regimes," the Northeast problem entered a more critical juncture. Now that the National army has recovered Changchun and continues to advance north, as long as the Communist Party can see the general trend and recognize that the country needs unification at this time, and voluntarily abandons its attempt to divide and occupy Harbin, Qiqihar, and the areas along the Chinese Changchun Railway, the Northeast problem may still see the light again.

The author believes that the crux of the Northeast problem can be divided into two parts: internal difficulties and external difficulties. If it were only internal difficulties or only external difficulties, the solution would be easier. Unfortunately, the Northeast problem is a difficult and complex case of internal and external interaction. Under mutual influence, it has become deeply entrenched. If the Communist Party has not abandoned the delusion of using external forces to divide and occupy territory, it will inevitably deviate from the path of solutions that are beneficial to the country and the nation, and go further and further away. The author, with a clear understanding of the importance of the Northeast problem, will conduct a concise review of the nature of the Northeast problem from the perspectives of the world situation, China's future, and the goals of the Chinese Communist Party.

(II) Viewing the Northeast Problem from an International Perspective

The Northeast problem is not simply a problem between China and the Soviet Union, but a major part of the entire world peace problem. Especially under the Soviet Union's current national policy, we are even more convinced that the Northeast problem is inherently international. What is the Soviet Union's current national policy? The Soviet authorities have not announced it to the world. However, many facts may help us understand it.

The Soviet Union's west was originally shrunk to the eastern end of Finland. During the German-Polish war, the Soviet Union annexed Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and eastern Poland. The current Polish government, whose predecessor was the Polish Committee of National Liberation under the Soviet Union's wing, naturally follows the Soviet Union's policies closely; Poland's territory may expand to eastern Germany in the future. To the southwest, the Soviet Union has taken Czechoslovakia into its control and placed Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Yugoslavia under its wing. Austria in Central Europe is already a must-have for the Soviet Union, and Greece at the southern end of the Balkans and Turkey, which spans Europe and Asia and controls the gateway to the Black Sea, have also become areas of concentrated attention for the Soviet Union. To the south, there is the Iranian problem. Did Iran not contribute to the Soviet Union's fight against Germany, and did it not jointly issue a declaration with Britain and the United States after the Tehran Conference respecting its sovereignty and independence? However, although the Soviet army has reluctantly withdrawn, anti-national autonomous movements have occurred in the Soviet army's defense zone and have not been clarified until now. Looking at our Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Northeast to the southeast, Mongolia has broken away from our motherland for more than twenty years under the stationing of Soviet troops, and now it has achieved independence through the exchange of notes in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. The Yili Incident in Xinjiang has created a situation for China that is the same as the situation created for Iran by the Azerbaijan autonomous movement. As for the Northeast problem, allowing the Communist troops to gain the convenience of entering, and creating the month-long war in the Northeast, whether there will be other developments in the future, cannot be predicted at this time.

From the above, we can see that a part of the Soviet Union's post-war national policy is:

First, to expand its borders. This border, according to the current situation, has already reached the extent of the Tsarist era in the west; in the east, Soviet leaders have also clearly put forward the demand to restore the rights of the Tsarist era, and in fact they have achieved it to a considerable extent; in Iran, Tsarist Russia and Britain delineated spheres of influence, and Britain and Russia jointly invaded Iran during the First World War. The Azerbaijan incident seems to be a further step; in the Balkans, the policy of Tsarist Russia's pan-Slavism has been realized, which can be said to be a superior achievement.

Second, the Soviet Union's method of expanding its borders can be divided into the following types: one is to merge into the Soviet Union's territory or organize socialist republics to join the Soviet Union; the second is to establish pro-Soviet governments, making them foreign elements of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia is an example; the third is to establish Communist Party regimes, creating a situation of division and occupation of neighboring countries, so that the Soviet Union's neighbors no longer have unified and powerful countries.

Third, the Soviet Union's common methods of creating pro-Soviet regimes or Communist Party regimes are to develop the Communist Party or similar organizations during the period of stationing troops, and its appeals are either democratic or nationalistic, depending on the local environment.

After we understand the above international situation and a part of the Soviet Union's national policy, we can know that the occurrence and development of the Northeast problem has its background of the times and is inseparable from the Soviet Union's national policy. In short, the Soviet Union is implementing the establishment of pro-Soviet or communist outer-defense regimes, to make its neighboring countries become easily controlled weak countries or small countries. The national policy promoted by our Chinese government is to be friendly with the Soviet Union and the United States, and to try to get the United States and the Soviet Union to approach and be friendly because of China's mediation. Especially in economic development, China's help to foreign countries, whether it is the United States or the Soviet Union, is welcomed without discrimination. China's construction is about its own prosperity, happiness, and the guarantee of independent and autonomous rights and interests. Therefore, the policies that China implements internally and externally, in the Soviet Union's view, may be somewhat different from the policies implemented by the Soviet Union, especially as China approaches the United States, which makes the Soviet Union suspect that a future powerful China may give the Soviet Union a major disadvantage, thus strengthening the implementation of its original policies. The Soviet Union's various actions in the Northeast, and the Communist Party's mess in the Northeast, were brewed in this kind of imagination.

(III) Viewing the Northeast Problem from the Perspective of the Chinese Communist Party

The Chinese Communist Party is a key player in the development of the Northeast problem, so we should pay attention to how the Communist Party views the Northeast problem. To understand the Communist Party's views, we must first understand the following points:

First, the Chinese Communist Party is a political party that calls itself Marxism-Leninism. The characteristic of this doctrine in political activities is to seize power by means of armed rebellion, and to create a socialist country by means of one-party dictatorship. This socialist country has a motherland, and it is a sacred duty to obey the orders of the socialist motherland. Since the Chinese Communist Party is a Marxist-Leninist party, it naturally has these characteristics. Another point is that the Marxist-Leninist party calls itself the most progressive party, and the socialist country is also called the newest type of democratic country. Because of this, they always look at people with a bit of distrust and discrimination, and suspicion seems to have become their nature. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to talk about credibility with the Chinese Communist Party.

Second, since the Chinese Communist Party is a Marxist-Leninist party and has the sacred duty to obey the orders of the socialist motherland, the Chinese Communist Party views the Northeast problem, rather than standing on the market of China's interests, it can be said that it stands on the position of the Soviet Union's interests. In fact, the Chinese Communist Party cannot but do so, because if the Chinese Communist Party replaces the position of the socialist motherland with the position of the nation and the country, it will immediately lose the Soviet Union's trust. On the other hand, if the National Government can accommodate the Soviet Union's interests in planning the Northeast problem, then the Soviet Union may give the convenience given to the Chinese Communist Party to the National Government.

Third, since the Chinese Communist Party has consistently taken armed rebellion to seize power as its central proposition, so-called peace, so-called consultation, etc., are naturally just temporary gestures. The favorable conditions in the Communist Party's mind are national chaos, people's unrest, and terror everywhere, rather than stability and prosperity. This point coincides with a part of the Soviet Union's current national policy. Here, we can understand the Communist Party's confidential order of "continuous conflict, continuous negotiations." China has gone through more than eight years of war against Japan, and people are tired of chaos and eager to live and work in peace and unity. This is a major trend that cannot be violated. However, this major trend is exactly the opposite of the Communist Party's favorable conditions. How to use this opposite trend to make it a factor that is beneficial to the Communist Party? The Communist Party's method is this: when Japan first surrendered, on the one hand, it competed with the government for the right to accept the surrender, and on the other hand, it issued seven orders to attack large cities, transportation centers, and transportation lines. Under the name of uprising, restoration, and liberation, it expanded the occupied areas, creating a basis for the preparation of civil war. At the same time, it put forward slogans such as anti-civil war and peace movement, and even negotiated a truce, ostensibly seeking peace, but in fact to protect its occupied areas. But resolutions are resolutions, actions are actions, and after the resolution, the propaganda must do its best to exaggerate the other party's destruction of the resolution, in order to launch another attack, so that people in the country will not suspect that they are opposing peace and obstructing unification.

Fourth, as far as the Chinese Communist Party itself is concerned, from the Xianggan Uprising, the establishment of the Soviet in southern Jiangxi, to the 25,000-mile Long March to the Yan'an area in northern Shaanxi, they were all in the interior, and they were all far away from the socialist motherland. In other words, they were all fighting alone in barren land, and development was very difficult. Therefore, after the Chinese Communist Party captured Zhangjiakou, it had a tendency to abandon Yan'an and move its center to Zhangyuan. The Northeast has a large population and abundant resources, and it is adjacent to the socialist motherland on three sides, so it is naturally an ideal base for the Chinese Communist Party. During the period when the Japanese occupied the Northeast, the Communist troops could not get in, which was a major regret for the Communist Party. This time, under the wing of the Soviet army, the Communist Party divided and occupied the cities of the Northeast. What is missing is a legal issue. Therefore, the Communist Party and its foreign elements put forward the slogan that the Northeast problem must be resolved through consultation, on the one hand, making the most of the opportunity to create ready-made facts, and on the other hand, doing its best to publicize and shirk responsibility on the other party. When a negotiated solution cannot be obtained, it does not hesitate to use force, and uses a full-scale civil war as a backing. This shows that the Communist Party regards the Northeast as something in its pocket.

We must pay attention to the facts of the development of the Northeast problem. The government, based on the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and its annexes, requested the withdrawal of troops and the establishment of government agencies, and after many compromises and negotiations, it obtained some results, and the withdrawal of the Soviet army took so much back and forth and wasted so much time to realize a part of it. Therefore, whether the Communist Party abandons its attempt to divide and occupy the Northeast is a major key to the domestic peace problem in the future. (Continued on page 3)

[Our Newspaper News] London, 1st Broadcast: Two wars broke out in the Far East today. French and Vietnamese troops in Hanoi have once again clashed, with casualties on both sides. The Siam-Vietnam border has been quiet. The French authorities are exaggerating war reports. In East India, there were also serious conflicts today, with sixty Indians killed or injured.

[Our Newspaper News] London, 1st Broadcast: The French Commissioner in Cochinchina, Mr. Sédille, declared: "An independent Republic of Cochinchina has been proclaimed within the Vietnamese Federation of the French Republic." He stated: The first task of the new republic is to organize a plebiscite to decide whether to join the Viet Minh Free State formed by members of the Annam Nationalist Party of Hanoi. The Viet Minh State has been recognized by France in March as an independent republic under the Vietnamese Federation of the French Republic, while Cochinchina has been under direct French colonial rule for eighty-four years.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 31st Dispatch] The Siamese government today notified the United Nations organization that the government is prepared to accept all the constraints stipulated in the United Nations Charter. At the same time, it once again notified the United Nations Secretary-General Lie, recounting the relationship between Siam and France and accusing the various incidents that have occurred along the Mekong River since last year. The various incidents are as follows: (1) France arrested Siamese overseas Chinese and used rifles and machine guns to attack the Mekong River bank on the Siamese side.

### Yoshida Shigeru and Our Newspaper Correspondent Discuss Domestic Issues in Japan; Says There is No Place in the World for Japanese Immigrants; Admits Respect for Chairman Chiang's Kind Treatment of Prisoners of War

[Our Newspaper, Tokyo Correspondent, 31st Dispatch] Since Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru formed his cabinet, our newspaper's Tokyo correspondent made his first solo visit to the Prime Minister's official residence yesterday. It began at 3:00 PM and lasted for forty minutes, ending at 3:40 PM. Prime Minister Yoshida met with the reporter in his personal office, without any members of parliament, and spoke in English. He also allowed the reporter to take photos, etc. This was the first time because he usually dislikes meeting reporters, and he is especially unwelcome to photography reporters. During the conversation, Yoshida claimed: Some foreign reporters have criticized his reluctance to meet reporters, which is true because he personally dislikes publicity. As for the "so-called national crisis in Japan," Yoshida replied: He has only been in office for a short time and has not had enough time to study the serious problems he has seen. Regarding the food problem, he said: In the future, Japan must import soybeans from Northeast China, chestnuts from North China, pears, and glutinous rice from the Yangtze River Basin, while Japan will export agricultural tools to China. Then they talked about how to solve the problem of Japan's outward population expansion. He said that the Japanese may move into the South Pacific or some other area in the future. Yoshida told the reporter frankly: There is really no place in the world for the Japanese to move into. The only way is to make Japan highly industrialized. Then he raised the current political situation problem. He said that he had no preparation to become Prime Minister in advance. It is well known that he is now planning to resign and let the capable take over, but no one is willing to take over the position of Prime Minister. He also said: He expressed great admiration for Chairman Chiang's speech to the Chinese people forgetting the past and treating the Japanese who were disarmed kindly. Yoshida also said that when he visited Shanghai in 1932, he had talked with his old friend Mr. Huang Guoguang about some methods to promote new relations between China and Japan, and asked him to convey them to the Chinese government for the sake of China and Japan. The result was good, but when he brought the plan back to Japan, it failed because the Prime Minister at the time was Admiral. He did not value the suggestions he made. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he felt disappointed. The people of the two countries follow the same Confucian religion, so they should love each other like brothers. Regarding how to rebuild Japan, he said that if we want to rebuild Japan's industry, the first condition is to have sufficient food to feed the people, otherwise nothing can be done. Yoshida finally said: He likes the Chinese people very much and hopes to convey to your country people his gratitude to your country people through your newspaper and forgive our past mistakes.

### Japanese People Rush to Withdraw Savings; Bank Accounts are Limited

[United Press, Tokyo, 1st Dispatch] Japanese people fear that the government may freeze citizens' savings after the weekend as a tighter measure to suppress inflation, so they are rushing to withdraw their maximum savings from banks. In front of the gates of banks and post offices in Tokyo, there are long lines of nervous people. The new Minister of Finance, Ishibashi Tanzan, publicly denied that the government intended to take this action. The amount of currency issued by the Bank of Japan has been reduced to 15.2 billion yen. In the past thirty days, due to food shortages and rising prices of daily necessities, another 5 billion yen has been issued. Officials believe that if it continues to expand, there is a danger that the amount of issuance will reach 60 billion yen in August.

However, on the other hand, it is believed that the court will take several days to review the motions of both the defense lawyers and the prosecutors, so the defense lawyers' request to postpone the reopening for a week will be realized. The American defense lawyers have basically arrived to prepare for the trial, and they have been gathering in the court to discuss defense methods in recent days. Among the newly arrived American defense lawyers, Gaeta, who is responsible for Tojo's defense, is well-known in the United States for his debating skills, and is expected to have fierce debates with the prosecutors.

### British Scientists Suggest the United Nations Should Internationally Control Atomic Energy

[Reuters, London, 31st Dispatch] The British Atomic Scientists Association has issued a memorandum, preparing to submit it to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. The memorandum recommends abolishing the existing regulations on atomic secrecy, disclosing basic scientific information, and allowing free and open research on atomic energy, but the main results should be reported to the United Nations organization. Atomic energy should be internationally controlled, and the United Nations should appoint investigators who have the right to investigate in any country to prohibit them from going beyond the scope approved by the United Nations and engaging in the manufacture of atomic energy. The raw materials of atomic energy should also be managed and operated by the United Nations. The Atomic Energy Commission should establish large-scale factories to manufacture atomic raw materials. These factories should be distributed all over the world to achieve balance. Bombs and explosives should be directly controlled by the United Nations. The final goal is to completely abolish the manufacture of these items. American Deputy Secretary of State Acheson issued a report from the Atomic Energy Commission appointed by the State Department in March, classifying atomic energy activities into "safe" and "dangerous" categories. This suggestion is quite approved by our association. We believe that all countries will be able to cooperate and establish a new environment of trust, and conduct joint research to reduce the danger of war.

Amidst negotiations to curb the labor unrest, seven major maritime labor unions suddenly raised demands for increased wages and related working hours. They are requesting a 40-hour work week with wages of $0.22 to $0.35 per hour.

[Associated Press Washington, 1st] Maritime union leaders and ship owners, amidst an atmosphere of hostility and pessimism, agreed to continue negotiations today to seek to avoid the maritime workers' strike on June 15th.

### Violating the Moscow Conference Resolution: Britain and the US Protest to Romania, No Elections, No Freedom of Speech. Romanian Prime Minister Claims General Election Will Be Held in Early Autumn

[United Press London, 1st] The British Foreign Office announced today that it had delivered a note to the Romanian government protesting Romania's failure to hold elections and its lack of freedom of speech.

[Reuters London, 31st] The Soviet Union and the other three powers seem to have abandoned their uncooperative attitude on transportation and technical issues in Germany and Austria. This change is a symbol of improved relations between the non-Soviet powers. This is evidenced by two things: first, the Soviet Union agreed to the British, American, and French proposal to establish a Central European Railway Vehicle Exchange Bureau in Vienna, covering Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Austria, and the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, which will greatly facilitate the flow of goods within Central Europe and between Central and Western Europe; second, the Soviet Union allowed Austria to participate in the Central European Inland Transport Office. Austria is the center of Central European water and land transportation, and it is expected to greatly benefit the recovery of the European economy.

### Two Knots in the British Transportation Line to the Far East: Egypt and Palestine (Part 2)

— Our Newspaper's London Special Correspondent Xueyan

Appeasing the Arabs Offends the Jews

Looking east from Egypt, across the Red Sea, is Palestine. Palestine is a legacy inherited by Britain after the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire in World War I, entrusted to Britain by the League of Nations under a mandate, and is now also a field of controversy. As early as 1917, before the end of the European War, when this land was under British rule and the legal status was undecided, Britain was already interested in this land. Foreign Secretary Balfour issued the famous Balfour Declaration, saying that he would take this land to settle displaced Jews and turn it into a Jewish national homeland. But at the same time, it was also declared that the principle was not to harm the interests of the original inhabitants. This resounding declaration won a lot of praise. As a result, the League of Nations entrusted Britain to govern this land according to this principle. But strangely enough, although the Balfour Declaration was concise and resounding, it was extremely difficult to implement. Appeasing the Arabs who live there offends the Jews. The opposite is also true. The two are mutually incompatible and have never been reconciled. In addition, the gradual popularization of Arab nationalism and the increasing number of Jewish immigrants have led to constant conflict. Although Britain has sent several investigation teams to seek a compromise solution for both parties, the results have never been satisfactory. Superficial peace relies on armed forces to suppress it. Until the end of last year, the British government, with the consent of the United States, sent another joint British-American investigation team to investigate the truth, with a deadline of 120 days to submit a report and suggestions for the two governments to refer to and adopt. British Foreign Secretary Bevin even said when announcing this policy that he was willing to bet his political future on its success, which shows his great confidence.

Investigation Team's Recommendations

Cannot Break the Difficult Deadlock

After this policy was announced, the members of the investigation team immediately determined the organization and began work. Before the deadline arrived, the report had already been submitted, and it contained ten suggestions that were quite contrary to Britain's current policy. After a week of research by the British government, Prime Minister Attlee submitted the report to the House of Commons, saying that he would not criticize it until he had fully consulted the opinion of the US government. He also hinted that if the British government wanted to adopt the ten recommendations in the report, it would adopt them all, otherwise it would not consider any one part of them. But the opinion of the US government seemed to be just the opposite. After studying it, US President Truman issued a criticism, only pointing out one point that the US government has always supported, saying it was very good, but did not say a word of support for the other points in the recommendation. At the same time, when the investigation team was working, the Jews opposed it very strongly. The British government sent a large army to Palestine to suppress it, and as a result, terrorist incidents launched by Jews often occurred. After this report was released, the Jews silently recognized it after studying it. On the contrary, the Arabs were quite quiet during the investigation process, but after the report was released, they immediately indicated that it was inappropriate and had issued a warning of their determination to oppose it. The content of the report was slightly biased towards the Jews. If it is implemented in the future, the resistance and disturbances of the Jews may be expected to calm down, and the rebellion of the Arabs will definitely replace it. On the contrary, if it is shelved and there is no other better new method, then the unrest initiated by the Jews in Palestine now will still be unable to relax. The United States is concerned about the future of the Jews because there are many Jews in the United States. On the contrary, Britain has many Arabs under its rule, so it must take into account the resistance of the Arabs. The recommendations of this investigation team are unlikely to break this difficult deadlock, and they also expose the differences in opinion between Britain and the United States in this regard.

Determine the Goal First

Two Ethnic Groups Rise to Equality

As for the ten recommendations of the investigation team, in summary, they can be briefly described as follows: The lives of Jews in various parts of Europe who have been poisoned by the Nazis are very miserable. All countries in the world should open their immigration doors and allow Jews to immigrate. Palestine is the place that Jews are most willing to go to, and they should be allowed to immigrate. However, Palestine alone cannot accommodate so many Jews, so it must be shared by various countries. Before various issues are agreed upon, 100,000 people should be allowed to immigrate to Palestine within one year. After these 100,000 people immigrate, Palestine will continue to be opened, and the number of people immigrating each year should be determined according to production capacity. In view of the mutual incompatibility between the local Arabs and Jews, Palestine cannot be allowed to be independent for the time being, and the mandatory governing country should continue to assume responsibility, and later be governed under the United Nations trusteeship. And first determine the goal, neither to make it an Arab country nor to make it a Jewish country, but a country where the two ethnic groups coexist and prosper. At the same time, Palestine should strive to develop its resources and build water conservancy projects so that it can support the ever-increasing population. In addition, it is necessary to find ways to improve the living and education standards of the Arabs, so that they are equal to the Jews, so that the two ethnic groups can achieve true equality and there is no need to be suspicious of each other.

Although there are many lofty and ambitious plans in this construction. But those that are lofty and ambitious are inevitably long-term and have a bleak future, and are impractical. On the contrary, the point of immigrating Jews is very concrete and can be seen immediately, and the 100,000 people immigrating within one year must be handled immediately. We know that Palestine is a small place and its production is not very good, and it can only accommodate at most more than 2 million people. Now there is a population of about 1.8 million, and the number of Arabs and Jews is almost equal. Not to mention the continued immigration in the future, just these 100,000 people squeezed in already feel a great weight. Arabs oppose this. Secondly, the Arabs now demand independence, and the suggestion says that it is not allowed, which is naturally one of the reasons for opposition. On the contrary, improving education and living standards is quite empty talk, and the saying that the two ethnic groups coexist and prosper is even more unguaranteed. Once the Jews occupy the majority, it will be difficult for the Arabs to hope for equality again. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Arabs oppose this suggestion. (End)

### Several Views on the Northeast Problem: Continued from Page 2, Weekly Review

(4) Looking at the Northeast from China

We Chinese ourselves have a unified view on the Northeast issue. That is, the Northeast is our Chinese territory and the lifeline of the Chinese people. The purpose of our eight-year War of Resistance was to recover the Northeast. Our recovery of the Northeast has long been agreed upon by the Allied nations. Even the Soviet Union has given us a clear stipulation in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. In terms of law, we already have sufficient grounds, but the evolution of the facts has led to such chaos. We are truly filled with emotion. Our patience is limited, and we are already inexpressibly grief-stricken.

We Chinese people deeply understand that the Northeast and our North China are interdependent and share the same fate. Our Chinese history fully proves this relationship. Not to mention the distant past, just take the Song and Ming dynasties as examples. The Khitans, the Liao, and the Jin all rose in the Northeast. The Song dynasty was always in a state of temporary peace. After the Qing dynasty rose in Jianzhou, the Ming dynasty was always exhausted by the defense of Liaodong, and ultimately perished because of this. Looking again at the period after September 18th, when the Northeast was in the hands of the Japanese, our North China was even more insecure and in a precarious situation. Therefore, we Chinese people firmly demand that the special status of the Northeast not be allowed to exist and that the Northeast must be unified under the central government of the country. We cannot tolerate the situation after the victory of the War of Resistance repeating itself today. We cannot bear to imagine what the ending of the Song and Ming dynasties was like? We are even more reluctant to recall what the ending after September 18th was like? Therefore, we must take precautions and eliminate all evil causes to avoid the recurrence of evil consequences.

We also understand that high-altitude areas are important for air transportation and national defense surveillance. Former US Vice President Wallace once visited our wartime capital. His journey passed through Xinjiang. He said, "I came from the front door of China." In fact, we have two front doors: one is Xinjiang, and the other is the Northeast. In terms of Sino-US air traffic, the front door is actually the Northeast, while Xinjiang is still a side door. The northward shift of China's external military focus is an inevitable result of the air age. The relationship between this gateway and our national defense will become closer with the progress of the times. We Chinese people will also have to redouble our efforts to maintain our ownership of this gateway because of the mission of the times!

Finally, we have a deeper understanding of this, which is recognized from the vicissitudes of the Northeast's international relations. We know that the Northeast in the late Qing Dynasty became a battleground for Japan and Russia. The ebb and flow of the two countries' power once evolved into the tragedy of the Russo-Japanese War. After September 18th, Japan exclusively occupied the Northeast. Shidehara said, "It's like watching a bomb," and it eventually evolved into World War II. When we investigate the reasons, in a nutshell, it is because China's national power declined and power was lost. The current situation in the Northeast, coupled with the gunpowder atmosphere in the international community, may very well lead to World War III. We Chinese people absolutely love peace and deeply know that war will only destroy China. Therefore, we are extremely unwilling for the Northeast issue to not have a reasonable solution. Now, to be honest, the various disagreements between the United States and the Soviet Union will inevitably affect our China. Especially the differences of opinion on the Korean issue have a greater impact on our Northeast issue and a greater threat to world peace. If a special regime with the nature of a Soviet periphery is established in the Northeast, it will be tantamount to a fatal blow to China's survival and a major threat to US security and world peace. Only by integrating the Northeast completely into China, under our unbiased national policy, can we reduce friction between the United States and the Soviet Union and gradually approach harmony, and jointly devote ourselves to building the foundation of world peace. This is another important task for us to maintain the Northeast.

(5) Conclusion

In summary, we can see that the Northeast issue is, on the one hand, the most important part of our domestic party issues. It can be said that it is the key to whether domestic peace can be maintained in the future. On the other hand, it is a corner of a complex international issue, and the maintenance of world peace in the future is also greatly affected by this.

Secondly, we must pay attention to the fact that China after the long-term War of Resistance must not have long-term chaos. Our people must use sharp eyes to distinguish who is trying to create long-term chaos. Our people must use calm minds to objectively examine national outlook, national sentiment, and socialist state positions, and see which one is most beneficial to us. We also ask the Chinese Communists to make the above considerations. We need an independent and autonomous country, we need an orderly society, we need construction and prosperity, and we need political parties to not forget that they are organized by Chinese people.

Furthermore, for the sake of the survival of the country, for the sake of the people's lives, and for the sake of world peace, we demand that unnecessary international disputes should be avoided as much as possible, and we should take out sincerity to think about peace and happiness. The Northeast is a region where our life and death are at stake. China is a great power in name only. China's possession of the Northeast will never be a threat to world peace or infringe on the interests of any country. In fact, China does not currently have this ability, and even if it becomes a powerful country in the future, there will never be the above danger. This can be found in history and in the view of Chinese national character. There is no need for the Soviet Union to support another Communist regime on the Chinese border as its security guarantee.

Finally, we also have a sincere expectation for the Chinese Communist Party. First, the position of the socialist motherland, at least in China in the next few decades, cannot be called for, especially since it violates the spirit of Chinese national character and historical education, and this path will inevitably not work. Any clever means or ingenious propaganda, if this meaning is not considered, will inevitably lose faith in front of the Chinese people and only lose the country's vitality, sacrificing the strength of the CCP. Second, the concept of seizing power by force must be truly abandoned, and the right path of democratic countries must be followed, and power and ability must be won in the parliament with policies. If they continue to create chaos and disturbances in order to seize power, the result is that the goal is difficult to achieve, and the country is destroyed, the people are killed, and the CCP itself is also destroyed. If the CCP accepts this point of advice, then any problem is very easy to solve, and the Northeast problem will naturally no longer be a problem. Our people have the right to demand that the CCP accept our expectations. We must take out the strength of the masters to make it accept our demands!

### Social Affairs Bureau Convenes Industrial and Commercial Sectors to Discuss Resolving the Current Crisis; Minister Gu Attends and Announces Government Policies; Warns Vegetable and Meat Industries; Mayor Wu Will Not Tolerate Illegal Price Gouging

[Report from this newspaper] Due to frequent labor unrest in the city's industrial and commercial sectors, coupled with a shortage of raw materials and high costs rendering them unable to compete with foreign goods, business has plummeted, pushing them to the brink of bankruptcy. In addition to taking various effective measures to prepare for a rescue, Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang recently came to Shanghai from Nanjing to announce the government's policies for handling labor unrest to those in charge of various labor unions, strictly prohibiting illegal strikes and slowdowns. Mr. Gu came to Shanghai again yesterday morning to attend a discussion meeting convened by the Social Affairs Bureau in the afternoon with those in charge of various trade associations. Mayor Wu also attended and delivered a speech. Attendees included Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, Special Commissioner Lu Jingshi of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Director Zhao Banfu of the Labor Affairs Office of the Social Affairs Bureau, Chairman Wang Xiaolai of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and over two hundred representatives from various trade associations. After the formalities, Chairman Wu Kaixian explained the significance of the meeting, stating that everyone is deeply concerned about the current industrial and commercial crisis. Minister Gu had already convened those in charge of various labor unions to give instructions. Solving the current problem requires not only workers to take responsibility and obey order, but also the industrial and commercial sectors to cooperate with the government's policies to help resolve this crisis.

Following this, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, stating: Shanghai is the commercial center of the country, with imports and exports accounting for nearly ninety percent of the total. Therefore, Shanghai's prosperity or decline has a significant impact on the entire country. Assuming office as the Mayor of Shanghai, I feel a great responsibility, and it is my greatest responsibility to support industry and commerce and to resolve the current economic crisis. Tell me your suffering and dissatisfaction, brothers, and I will gradually improve things. I also hope that officials and the people can work together as one, and that there is no separation between the people and the government. He then stated several points to those present: (1) Promote frugality and hope that advanced industrial and commercial leaders will set an example, saving manpower, financial resources, and materials for national construction and production. (2) Suppress speculators and ask all sectors to assist in this. Violators will be severely punished. Grain prices have already begun to fall. The result of this grain registration is only over 400,000 dan. However, it is known that various firms registered at 60% of their actual reserves. The municipal government is not unaware of this, and has already investigated. In addition to detaining Wu Changmi and Rong Yongming again, over three thousand packages of unregistered grain from the Santai Company have been confiscated. The registration deadline is now extended to the evening of next Tuesday (June 4th). If you do not register after the deadline, you will be completely confiscated after being reported. (3) I warn the trade associations of the vegetable and fresh pork industries that the recent increase in the market price of vegetables and pork is even greater than that of rice, and decisive action will be taken to suppress this. If there is extortion, report it to the municipal government for severe punishment. In short, the prosperity or decline of Shanghai affects the whole country. It is my responsibility to eliminate violence, protect the good, increase production, and develop commerce. I will follow the central government's policies and implement them thoroughly, so that Shanghai can restore its former glory.

### Minister Gu Provides Detailed Explanation of the Policy for Handling Labor Unrest

Minister Gu then spoke, first stating that he originally intended to invite Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu to come together, but Minister Wang was unable to attend due to various matters. Therefore, what he will say today is limited to matters within the scope of his ministry. Economic issues will be addressed by Minister Wang on another day. Minister Gu said that the government is determined to improve economic difficulties and support the proper development of industry and commerce. He explained the following key points regarding the government's handling policies and what the industrial and commercial sectors should understand: (A) Government labor policies and the policy for handling the current labor unrest: 1. The main spirit of the labor policy: (1) Support workers' organizations, improve workers' lives, and raise the status of labor. (2) Promote labor-management coordination, improve labor efficiency, and develop productive enterprises. 2. Policy for handling labor unrest: (1) Workers' legitimate interests should be protected. (2) Labor discipline must be rectified. (3) Labor-management disputes should be handled in accordance with legal procedures. 4. Adjustments to wages should be handled in accordance with the prescribed principles. (B) What national industrialists should understand: 1. To seek the development of productive enterprises, they should assist the government in stabilizing prices and suppressing speculation in order to stabilize social and production order. 2. Rescuing the industrial crisis requires not only eliminating labor unrest but also improving all production conditions. 3. Increasing production must pay attention to labor welfare. 4. Respect the personality, status, and legitimate rights and interests of labor. 5. Labor-management disputes should be handled in accordance with the law in order to achieve a reasonable solution. (C) Several points that are hoped the industrial and commercial sectors will achieve: 1. Improve the organization of industrial and commercial groups and help stabilize prices. 2. Formulate factory regulations in accordance with labor laws, submit them to the government for approval, and implement them conscientiously. 3. Implement factory meetings to promote labor-management cooperation. 4. Allow workers to legally form factories and should not have a discriminatory attitude towards labor unions. 5. Quickly develop welfare undertakings to improve workers' lives and increase work efficiency. 6. , salaries should be handled in accordance with the prescribed procedures. 7. Without government approval, do not suspend or close factories without reason. 8. Fully trust and obey the government and handle labor-management disputes in accordance with the law. 9. Colleagues should not poach workers from each other or increase wages without authorization.

### Stabilizing Prices Requires Cooperation

Mr. Gu stated: Stabilizing prices cannot be achieved by individual strength or government laws alone, but relies on the understanding and cooperative efforts of colleagues to be effective. The laws and policies stipulated by the government are not intended to give special protection to a certain class, but are determined in consideration of the comprehensive interests and needs of all parties. The government's policy is the people's demand, so it will never be biased towards one side. Labor welfare and production efficiency are closely related, so capital should develop labor welfare as much as possible. Mr. Gu also emphasized that today's criteria for judging someone are not based on wealth or official rank, but on their contribution to humanity. Therefore, capital should respect the status of labor because labor-management cooperation comes from mutual respect and love. Regarding labor union organizations, Minister Gu used a precious knife as a metaphor: it can be used to kill people or to protect people, it all depends on how it is used. Therefore, labor unions are not necessarily bad, as long as they are properly led, they can be very helpful to production. Therefore, capital does not need to be afraid of them, and if you want workers to obey discipline, and want the government to maintain production discipline, there are many considerations that capital must improve. In short, past individual efforts have failed, and in the future we should cooperate together to resolve the current crisis. This is not for the benefit of any individual, but for the benefit of the entire nation.

### Mayor Wu Makes Conclusion and Announces Governance Policy

Regarding the incident in which unemployed workers who came to Shanghai from the rear area took unauthorized action at the Social Affairs Bureau the other day, Minister Gu stated: Minister Bu sympathizes with the unemployed workers and also considers them to be contributors to the war effort, so he will handle the matter leniently, but labor discipline must be strictly enforced, and the government will strictly implement it. Finally, Mayor Wu made a conclusion, announcing three governance policies: (1) Maintain and protect legitimate industry and commerce to encourage production. (2) Suppress speculation and stabilize prices. (3) Promote frugality to enrich the country and promote prosperity.

At this time, representatives from the handkerchief and silk weaving industries stood up one after another and appealed to Minister Gu, Mayor Wu, and others, expressing the heavy burden of current interest rates, the arrogance of workers, and the inability to maintain business, forcing them to the brink of bankruptcy, and various other crises. Luo Qinghua, representing the industrial and commercial sectors, described the difficulties of each industry, hoping that the party authorities would provide practical assistance and relief at this critical juncture of survival, and asked Minister Gu to appeal to the central government to take effective measures. There were many speakers following this, but because Minister Gu was busy with official duties, Wang Xiaolai announced that if there were any opinions, they could be submitted to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for forwarding to Minister Gu for review, and the meeting adjourned at around six o'clock.

### Travel Industry Complains; Price Limits Mean Inability to Maintain Operations; Traveler Burden Increases Rather Than Decreases

Yesterday at 7:00 PM, the Commercial Trade Association of the travel industry in the city held a reception for news reporters at Xinghualou Restaurant. During the reception, Xu Wenzhao, Sun Qiubing, Chen Songtao, and others in charge of the association successively described the difficulties faced by the industry. Their main points were: (1) Since the implementation of price limits, the impact of fluctuations has made it impossible to balance income and expenditure, resulting in heavy losses and leading to labor loan disputes. If this is not urgently improved, it will be impossible to maintain operations and will lead to total collapse. (2) Labor and management should help each other, otherwise, capital will be unable to operate. The reason for the inability of labor and management to coordinate is caused by price limits. (3) After the implementation of price limits, travel agencies had to increase room rates to compensate for expenses. The tip is a reward given by the customer to acknowledge good service and is given voluntarily, therefore, the burden on travelers actually increases rather than decreases. The association is currently submitting a report to relevant agencies such as the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting a return to the original state in order to survive.

### Seventeen Movie Theaters Implement Reserved Seating

The seventeen first and second-run movie theaters in the city, including the Grand Theater, have followed the order of the Police Bureau and implemented reserved seating for all shows starting yesterday.

### Kong Xiangxi Denies Buying Sassoon House; Claims He Has No Money to Buy a House

[Report from this newspaper] Kong Xiangxi, Chairman of the Bank of China, denied buying Sassoon House and other properties at a mayoral reception yesterday. Mr. Kong told reporters: "I simply have no money to buy a house. Even if I had property, I would invest it in businesses, not buy houses." Regarding the issue of labor unrest in the city, Mr. Kong believes that there cannot be labor unrest in China at present. The issue of labor unrest should be handled with consideration for both labor and management. China's industry is backward at present, and we should immediately develop industry and increase production. If the reduction in domestic production is due to the lower prices of imported goods, it is a major crisis. Also, Mr. Kong is quite willing to travel more within the country in the future, and plans to stay in his hometown of Shanxi for a while, but the date has not yet been decided.

### A Mine Exploded in the Wusong River; Houses in the Entire Town Shook Violently

At around 3:30 PM yesterday, a wooden box floated in the Huangpu River in Wusong and was discovered by a nearby small sailboat, which immediately went to retrieve it. At that time, various sampans also went there, thinking that there must be valuables hidden in the box, and they scrambled to grab it. When they opened the wooden box to inspect it, it suddenly exploded with a bang. White waves flew into the sky in the Huangpu River, and blood splattered everywhere. Houses throughout the entire town of Wusong were violently shaken. Upon hearing the alarm, the water and land authorities immediately mobilized and announced special martial law. According to a reporter's investigation, it was learned that the wooden box that was retrieved contained a mine. When it was hit and exploded, several sampans were shattered to pieces. More than twenty people, large and small, were killed, all with dismembered limbs, a gruesome sight. Forty to fifty people were injured. After local clinics bandaged their wounds, they were sent to various hospitals in Shanghai for treatment by car.

He confessed to serving as the bogus acting president of the Chinese Daily, but denied being a confidant of Lin Bisheng. As for participating in the "Greater East Asia Writers' Conference" in Tokyo, he said that he stayed in Tokyo for two days and did not discuss any issues, and claimed: "This is just the enemy's ridiculous trick, wanting to bring representatives from the occupied areas of China and Southeast Asia to Tokyo to show co-prosperity." After the interrogation, he was still detained. Also, Xue Qichou, station master of the Wusong Station Interrogation Station, Yan Zhongcheng, director of the bogus Suzhou Police Station, Pan Amao, a spy of the enemy Gendarmerie, and Qian Xiaomin, were all interrogated yesterday and ordered to be re-interrogated at a later date.

### Arch-traitor Liang Hongzhi; She Aizhen, who Assisted Her Husband in Evil Deeds; Both Male and Female Criminals Are Scheduled to Be Interrogated on the 5th

[Report from this newspaper] The case of Liang Hongzhi, the leader of the puppet Reformed Government, has been scheduled for its first trial on the afternoon of the 5th of this month at 2:00 PM. It has been found that Liang is a native of Changle, 64 years old, residing at 150 Bixun Road. He successively held important positions in the three puppet organizations of the Nanjing "Reformed Government," the Beiping "Joint Committee of the Chinese Government," and the Nanjing "National Government." The High Procuratorate charged him with occupying the capital, usurping administrative orders, changing the national flag, recruiting troops, creating a confrontation with the central government, fueling the enemy's aggressive flames, shaking the military and civilian's will to resist, disregarding the interests of the country and the survival of the nation, and brazenly colluding with the enemy to betray the country. He is truly an arch-traitor and a heinous criminal, and has committed the crime of colluding with the enemy to plot against the country under Article 2, Item 1 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors. On the same afternoon, She Aizhen, wife of the bogus special agent demon Wu Shibao, will be interrogated. It has been found that She is a native of Guangdong, 46 years old, residing at 7, Lane 349, Yuyuan Road. Here is an excerpt from the prosecutor's indictment: "The defendant Wu She Aizhen has confessed that Wu Shibao recruited accomplices, arrested underground workers of the central government, and killed employees of the Bank of China, but she does not admit that she manipulated and planned everything in Wu's illegal and reckless acts. However, according to the report of Shen Fenggang, director of the Second Division of the bogus Special Service Headquarters, "Wu Shibao is illiterate, and many things must be approved by Wu She Aizhen before they can be carried out," which proves that she did indeed do these things, and there is no need to deny it. She also confessed that she had been a long-time accountant for the guards of the bogus Special Service Headquarters, examined the thoughts and behaviors of the guards for Wu, participated in extrajudicial interrogations of so-called "political prisoners", protected gambling dens, and accepted subsidies, which are consistent with the descriptions in the Military Intelligence Department's records. The facts of the crime have been clearly established."

(Another report) Lin Kanghou has been scheduled for his first interrogation in the Criminal Division of the High Court at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 7th.

### Displaced and Suffering; Overseas Chinese Leader Huang Enshi Talks About His Experiences Upon Arriving in Shanghai

[Report from this newspaper] Huang Enshi, a leader of the overseas Chinese community in Batavia, recently told reporters that order in the Dutch East Indies has not yet been restored. Currently, the British-Dutch Allied Forces, the Dutch government, and the Republican government are in charge of political affairs in various places, forming a situation of three rulers in one country. The war is frequent, and prices are soaring. The business of the one million overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies has completely stopped, and most of them are only relying on selling furniture to survive. They are displaced and suffering terribly. Currently, the Republican government is located in Solo in central Java, the original site of the Governor-General's Palace, while the Allied Forces have established their headquarters in Bandung. In Bandung, a railway runs across the city, dividing the city into north and south districts. The southern district is the central area of the overseas Chinese, and the northern district is the headquarters of the Allied Forces and also has an airfield. The prices in these two districts are extremely different. For example, in the southern district, an egg sells for two Dutch guilders, while in the northern district, it costs fifteen guilders. The current exchange rate is 2.6 guilders to one US dollar, so prices are actually much higher than in Shanghai. The searches between these two districts are very strict. In March and April, nearly 100 overseas Chinese disappeared. Five to six hundred overseas Chinese shops have closed their doors. The overseas Chinese have always been known for their hard work and endurance, but now their lives are becoming increasingly difficult.

### The Dutch Government Authorities Have Good Feelings Towards Our Country

However, the Dutch government and the Republican government both have very good feelings towards China and greatly admire Chairman Chiang. They will bow and salute those Chinese residences displaying portraits of the Chairman. When the Japanese occupied the Dutch East Indies, they hung pictures of the four major leaders of the United Nations in the amusement park and allowed visitors to shoot arrows at the pictures for amusement, but no one ever took such action against the Chairman's portrait, not even the Malays. Later, the Japanese army finally took down the Chairman's portrait. During the occupation, there were such facts, which shows the respect and admiration of all people in the Dutch East Indies for the Chairman. Mr. Huang said that the current situation of war and disaster in the Dutch East Indies has plunged the people into deep water and fire. If our government sends senior officials to the Dutch East Indies, it will not only boost the morale of the overseas Chinese but also achieve great results in resolving the situation.

### Malays Speaking Chinese: A Source of Pride

Within the Republican government, all agencies are titled in Chinese, such as "Department of Propaganda" and "Post Office," all using Chinese plaques. Among the indigenous people, many possess extremely elegant Chinese calligraphy skills. The mutual benefit government deeply admires Premier Nehru's advocacy for aiding weaker nations and jointly seeking national liberation. The Dutch government also declared that without China's eight years of heroic resistance, they would not have been able to return to the Dutch East Indies. Currently, Malays consider being able to speak fluent and beautiful Chinese a source of pride, reversing the previous trend of not understanding Chinese or recognizing Chinese characters. Mr. Huang's visit is intended to prepare for an airline company, opening a route from China to the Dutch East Indies, currently still under negotiation. Huang is currently the General Manager of Batavia Yuansheng Import Trading Company and concurrently a commissioner of the Guangdong Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Guidance Committee. He remained unyielding during the Dutch East Indies' fall, highly respected by overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies.

### Toyoda, Murakawa Transferred to Military Tribunal

[This Newspaper's Report] Toyoda, the president of the Japanese Residents Association who orchestrated underground work for the Japanese side, and Murakawa Shun, the former Japanese Deputy Consul-General in Shanghai, were transferred from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to the military tribunal in this district at 2 PM yesterday. It has been verified that Toyoda was employed by the Japanese Embassy and the Shanghai Consulate-General during the War of Resistance, responsible for intelligence work in the Shanghai area. Murakawa Shun was a resident of Yagito Village, Kitakawachi District, Osaka Prefecture, Japan, and a graduate of the Harbin Japanese War Association School. He came to China in August of the thirtieth year of the Republic, serving as the Deputy Consul-General in Shanghai. During his tenure, he abused his authority to the fullest extent. In the thirty-fourth year of the Republic, he was reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and in July of the same year, he was transferred to the Shanghai Embassy Office as the head of the Reporting Section, subordinate to Toyoda, responsible for intelligence work in the Shanghai area. During his tenure, he arrested and killed countless of our compatriots. After the victory of the War of Resistance, he infiltrated the Japanese residential area, using the former intelligence agencies to collect information and plot evil schemes. After being arrested by order of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the investigation took as long as a month due to the complexity of the case.

### Shimoda Jiro Retried Yesterday

### Notorious Bandit Xu Liansheng of Chuansha Dominates Pudong, Running Rampant; After Arrest, He Escapes; Killed on the Spot in Second Encirclement

[This Newspaper's Report] Xu Liansheng, a notorious bandit from Chuansha County, is the son of Xu Hongfa, the traitorous former commander of the Chuansha puppet security brigade. He is only 27 years old. After the War of Resistance, relying on his father's influence, he specialized in kidnapping for ransom and raping women in the Pudong area, committing numerous crimes. His father, the traitor Xu Hongfa, was assassinated by our patriots during the War of Resistance. At that time, the bandit disappeared for a while. Unexpectedly, after the victory, taking advantage of the unstable local order, he recruited bandits again, making a comeback in various parts of Pudong and doing whatever he wanted. The bandit usually indulges in opium and heroin. In March of this year, while he was smoking heroin in a den in Chuansha County, the county magistrate Wang Yali heard about it. Without making a sound, he rushed to arrest him, but the bandit preempted him, capturing Magistrate Wang and confiscating all the guns of his guards.

### Plan for Peace Education Developed by the US Delegation to the United Nations; Restore World Education and Culture to Its Former State

[Reuters, New York, 31st dispatch] Hovde, a specialist secretary for the United States delegation to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in London, stated: "We must use education to make people deeply believe that war is not necessary; otherwise, the United Nations organization and any other stabilization mechanism will be nothing more than decorations. We must develop a global 'Peace Education' plan, using classrooms, radio, newspapers, movies, and speeches as the medium for disseminating this education." Peace education should include the following points: (1) Educating the people of all countries to know how to make full use of their domestic resources to improve their living standards. (2) Nations with resources should share their materials with nations without materials. (3) Improve the morality of international individuals. In addition, international co-management of atomic energy, providing food aid to the starving, trusteeship of defensive bases, exchange of news, information and international students, and eliminating extreme ideologies in textbooks can all promote international friendship and eliminate hostility. In order to restore cultural and educational centers around the world to their former state, the United States should donate 150 million US dollars to promote its success. This is enough to prevent cultural decline and allow the world to save itself by following the path of art and science.

### Guanghua Cup Football Tournament Opens, Donghua to Face Italian Navy, Kickoff at Yiyuan at 10 AM This Morning

The Guanghua Cup Football Tournament, organized to raise funds for the restoration of Guanghua University, has invited four strong teams from China and the West, Donghua, Qingbai, British Navy, and Italian Navy, to participate in the competition. It is a knockout system, with a total of three matches. The opening match between Donghua and the Italian Navy is scheduled to take place at Yiyuan at 10 AM this morning. Tickets are priced at 2,000 and 5,000 yuan, and there are also 100,000 yuan honorary seats available inside the venue, which can be used for all three matches.

Donghua's lineup has been slightly adjusted due to the departure of Zhuang Youren and Song Ling. Its strength is inevitably somewhat affected. Also, midfielder Fu Fuzhen has recently suffered from dysentery and originally planned to rest, but due to the lack of manpower, he had to take the field despite his illness. The team defeated the Western Union team with a partial lineup last week, which proves its extraordinary strength. Today, facing the Italian soldiers, it is hoped that they can overcome the enemy and achieve results.

The Italian Navy is the Anquili fleet that recently arrived in Shanghai. It defeated the British Navy 5-2 in a friendly match. This time, it has also borrowed the three musketeers, Taiboka, Kartza, and Bertattini, Corumb, which is even more icing on the cake. When they first meet the strong Chinese team, there will definitely be a wonderful performance.

Donghua: Zhang Banglun, Li Ning, Zhang Lingen, Han Longbo, Tan Fuzhen, Shen Jinda, Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Han Longhai, Han Longgen, Jia Youliang, Zhen Mingzhe.

Italian Navy: Taiboka, Keimi, Teroka, Monfuti, Xi Kele, Luofu, Bertattini, Corumb, Migaojie, Dimiqi Lie, Pompeii, Bapilie.

### Answering Readers' Questions, Medical and Health

(1) Hu Bonian asks: My sister is 26 years old. Starting in October of last year, her fingers and toes often turn pale and numb, and blood flow stops, but it returns to normal in about five or six minutes. Doctors said that there is nothing wrong with the blood vessels and nerves in her limbs, but her condition has been getting worse day by day. Her hands and feet have turned completely white. A month ago, she suddenly had knee pain, followed by pain in her head, neck, back, waist, and legs, which was unbearable and she could not move. Her appetite has gradually decreased, and she only drinks thin porridge all day. She is mentally exhausted. Is this phenomenon neuralgia? What medicine should she take? Is there any special medicine and specialist doctor?

(Dr. Yu Xin'en answers) The disease is called Raynaud's disease, which is caused by a disturbance in the vascular nerves. There is no special medicine. You can try taking thyroid hormones and applying moxibustion and massage locally. If it is ineffective, you can try surgery.

(2) Li Xingyuan asks: I have long admired your column for its enthusiasm in serving the society, and people from all walks of life have benefited greatly. My mother has been suffering from stomach problems for more than ten years. She is now 57 years old. At the beginning, she could still eat baking soda to treat it, but because my third brother died the year before last and my fourth sister died last year, and she was repeatedly threatened by the enemy puppets in the countryside, her condition has worsened in the past three years. Baking soda is no longer effective. Recently, she has been experiencing pain in her upper body, frequent vomiting, and has vomited coffee-colored filamentous blood. She cannot eat. I have consulted Chinese and Western doctors, but the treatment has been ineffective. The doctor said it is stomach cancer. Please advise on treatment methods.

(Dr. Yu Xin'en answers) It is indeed stomach cancer. If it is in the early stages, it can be surgically removed. Once it has metastasized, surgery is ineffective. Taking medicine and folk remedies is absolutely ineffective.

(3) Wang Yiqiu asks: Before my wife gave birth, her breasts were high and shapely. During her second childbirth, she breastfed, but after weaning, her breasts were not as good as before. Now, after her third childbirth, her breasts have become completely flat after weaning. Her breasts are no longer visible even with clothing on. My wife is very unhappy about this. Please advise on what methods and effective medicines can make her breasts high and restore their shapeliness?

(Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers) This is caused by a lack of internal secretion. You can try injecting female hormones, which should be effective.

(4) Guan Pinqiu asks: (1) There are small, red, swollen bumps on my face. When I press them with the side of my hand, there is a white, sauce-like liquid. This one heals, and another one appears. What method can be used to treat this? (2) My head is unbearably itchy, and the scalp is falling off in layers. Is it effective to wash it with a potassium permanganate solution?

(Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers) (1) This is acne, which can heal on its own. If the white serum squeezed out is made into a serum and injected into the body, it can be cured earlier. This is the so-called autogenous vaccine therapy. (2) It may be effective to rub your scalp with a 5% salicylic acid alcohol solution.

### Donation Report

(1) All employees of the China Textile Factory No. 17 jointly donated 1,460,650 yuan for the Hunan-Guangxi drought to save the drought-stricken people. This amount was handed over to this office for transfer to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for separate handling.

(2) The "National Construction Contribution" initiated by readers in February of this year has received a total of 93,000 yuan. This amount was transferred to the Respect Teachers Campaign Committee yesterday to be used as respect teacher funds.

(3) The eight feet of clothing material (deputy silk) published on the 12th of this month for collection, if not claimed within the time limit, will be priced and transferred to charity. Since no one has claimed it, this office has priced it at 10,000 yuan and transferred it to the "Respect Teacher Fund" to benefit the loser.

Yu Zengqing Donates Wind-Heat Relief Medicine

Mr. Yu Zengqing, a reader of this newspaper, personally sent 80 boxes of first-aid Wind-Heat Relief Medicine produced by Sino-European Rongji Huafang yesterday, instructing us to distribute them to the poor and sick masses. As the hot summer is approaching, Wind-Heat Relief Medicine is a common household medicine. People from all walks of life who are poor and sick and in need can get it from this office. We express our sincere thanks to Mr. Yu for his enthusiasm for public welfare.

Seeking Ye Tianshi's Secret Formula for Treating Teeth

To Whom It May Concern: There was a prescription from Doctor Ye Tianshi of Suzhou for treating toothache, which distinguishes between heart fire, stomach fire, lung fire, and liver fire, and adds a few more flavors according to the upper, lower, left, and right sides. It has been repeatedly tested and proven to be miraculously effective. It not only saves the trouble of seeing a doctor, but also saves on medicine costs. Unfortunately, it was lost during the war, and none of my relatives and friends have it either. I am borrowing a corner of your newspaper to publish this letter. If readers have this prescription and transcribe it to be published in your newspaper, it will greatly benefit the common people and is a truly immeasurable deed. Zhang Yanqi

After ten o'clock, it hovered around 1.79 million. The Bank of China allocated 21 strips, priced at 1.785 million. After that, it struggled around 1.79 million. In the afternoon, it was even more mediocre. As a result, it fell by 30,000 compared to the previous close. Gold jewelry was 190,000, and silver ingots and silver dollars were flat. The demand for private lending was inconsistent. The lending side was loose for insiders and tight for outsiders. The interest rate was 13 to 15% for insiders and 18 to 20% for outsiders.

Foreign currency, US dollars, was stable, with a high price of 2,335 yuan and a low price of 2,310 yuan. The market was very narrow, and it continued to struggle around 2,300 yuan until noon. The afternoon was the same. As a result, it fell slightly by 5 yuan compared to the previous close. There were rumors of a depreciation of Hong Kong dollars, falling by about 5 yuan. Robi and Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were still being sold at the previous price. The official and unofficial US exchange rates did not change, and transactions were difficult to facilitate.

Public bonds were initially weak and then stable yesterday. A weaving industry idle fund bought them after they fell, and the market atmosphere became active again. The Unified C opened at 6,700 yuan in the morning, but soon fell below 6,500 yuan before it was maintained. It once rose to around 6,850 yuan in the middle, but it was difficult to maintain, and it continued to be sold, falling again to 6,500 yuan. It stabilized slightly at noon. As a result, it still fell by 300 yuan compared to the previous close. A and B fell by 150 yuan, D fell by 200 yuan, and E fell by 100 yuan. Chinese stocks continued to weaken, and buyers temporarily stopped looking at the wind.

### Yarn Prices Gradually Decline, Spot Cotton Trading is Still Good

The yarn market turned weak again yesterday. Sales of green cotton were not sustained, and gold prices fell. The Shuangma cotton was initially stable in the morning, but it gradually declined as more and more people sold it, to 1.3 million. The other branches also fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan compared to yesterday. Due to the fact that the Shangri-La textile factory had a blue phoenix double-strand supply, the demand in the market decreased, and the price of 42 blue phoenix could not be sustained and retreated, closing at 2.52 million, a drop of more than 60,000. Yesterday, the "New York and American Cotton Telegraph" reported an increase of 10 to 12 pounds. The spot price for cotton was 28.05 for near-term US dollars, 28.63 for far-term, and 28.67 for spot cotton. Spot cotton trading in this port was still good. Private yarn factories slightly purchased cotton. The raw material price for Pootung textile machinery cotton 16s sent to the factory was as high as 100,000 yuan, which is on par with fine velvet raw materials.

### The Cloth Market is Slightly Weak

Profits from the cloth market were being sold, and at the same time, it was the time for China Textile to start selling, and many parties slightly sold off, so the market trend became weak. In the morning market, plain cloth and serge fell by 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan. However, as the shilin cloth gradually entered the peak season, the market conditions were no longer as sluggish as in the past. In the afternoon, it was heard that the goods listed for sale by China Textile were still very few. Only the V dragon head was available for 12-pound fine cloth, and the 3A color ball was limited to dyeing factories. Only 34 households were eligible for light green serge from No. 132 to No. 1042, with each household being allocated 20 pieces.

### Chinese Tallow Gradually Improves

The situation of Chinese tallow has gradually improved since the soap factory took over. Seventy to eighty percent of the goods stored in this port have been shipped out. Most of the prices are 40,000 yuan, while high-priced goods have fewer customers. Because the distribution sites and merchants do not have low stocks and do not lack materials. Only the goods from customers are slightly thin. The prices in Hankou and Hangzhou are similar to those in Shanghai. Therefore, it is not cost-effective to transport from there to here. As a result, the incoming goods are not very lively. If the weather is hot and soap use continues, it may improve again. Merchants sell to soap factories for 50,000 yuan, Sima scale, delivered to the factory, and sell for 60,000 yuan for this truck, 52,000 yuan for Neiping oil, 50,000 yuan for Dedian oil, 48,000 yuan for Du 砠 oil, 45,000 yuan for Lan oil, and 42,000 yuan for Macheng oil.

### China Farmers Bank Promotes Agricultural Loans, Reaching 6 Billion in Shanghai

The countryside is devastated after the war. Since the China Farmers Bank resumed business in Shanghai, it has actively promoted agricultural loans, and it has handled loans for fertilizers, cotton, fisheries, agricultural tools, tea, and various grains separately. At present, the bank focuses on silk loans. The bank has sent personnel to conduct direct loans with silk farmers in Wuxi, Jiangyin, Suzhou, Wujiang, and other silk-producing areas, and has established agricultural loan offices in Wuxi and Suzhou to facilitate silk farmers. This time, the bank's silk loans are separately loaned for silkworm seed production, processing, and transportation. It is heard that 1.41 billion yuan has been loaned out, of which cocoon drying and mortgage account for 770 million yuan, with a weekly interest of 4%, and a term of three months. Currently, when silkworm cocoons are on the market, the market price is only 100,000 yuan per dan, while the actual cost is 150,000 yuan. It is a big question whether the market price will rise in the future, and whether it can rise above 150,000 yuan after the rise. It is heard that the China Farmers Bank has decided to expand the scope of agricultural loans as much as possible. In addition to the 1.41 billion yuan in silk loans, a total of 5.11 billion yuan has been loaned for fertilizers, tea, fisheries, and cotton cloth. Among them, fertilizer loans have been loaned 600 million yuan in Jiangyin, Fengxian, Songjiang, Jinshan, Nanhui, Suzhou, Changshu, Kunshan, and other eight counties, cotton loans have been loaned 160 million yuan in Taicang and Jiading, earth cloth loans have been loaned 150 million yuan in Jiangyin, fishery loans in this city are 200 million yuan, and tea loans are 4 billion yuan.

### Escalating Increase, Gradual Decline: Rice Prices Drop Another Thousand Dollars; Food Administration to Purchase Vietnamese Rice Soon; Selling Price Not to Exceed 40,000 Dollars

Yesterday, rice market activity slowed, buyers were hard to find. Japonica and Indica regular rice both fell by over a thousand dollars. Flour dropped slightly by one to two hundred dollars. Soybeans arrived and sales were even. The market was peaceful. Red beans were scarce, rising sharply by over a thousand dollars. Corn prices decreased by over a thousand dollars. Mung beans increased slightly. New broad beans, originally from this area, were dried along the dirt roads, and prices rose by two to three thousand dollars. Soybean cakes were being watched by buyers, but the situation was weak, with a slight drop of two to three hundred dollars. The oil market was firm in the morning but weakened in the afternoon. According to information from the rice market, yesterday's rice arrivals in the city included seven types such as white japonica, totaling over seven thousand dan (石). The types and amounts in dan (石) are as follows: white japonica 3,578, thin rice 936, early rice 901, sheep indica 415, Du indica 177, Wu indica 888, white regular 354.

Furthermore, according to news from the Food Administration Special Commissioner's Office, in addition to contacting the United States and Canada for large quantities of food, they are also directly purchasing from nearby areas such as Annam and Qianluo. Recently, the office's order for rice from Annam has been shipped from Haiphong and is expected to arrive in Shanghai within days. The office has decided to sell it at the lowest price, with a price per dan not exceeding 40,000 dollars. As for the sales method, it will not be sold through the rice market but will be distributed fairly. In the future, if there is a large amount of imported rice, it will be distributed according to the household registration. It is reported that the rice ordered by government and merchants from Vietnam will arrive in Shanghai in large quantities of over ten thousand tons from mid-June onwards.

### Silk Trading Scarce, Silk Fabrics Reportedly Rising Across the Board Due to High Labor Costs and Taxes

Yesterday, there was limited trading of No. 120 Great Bridge raw silk futures. Spot prices first called for 1.4 million dollars, with the lowest bid at 1.34 to 1.35 million dollars. The final price was 1.37 to 1.38 million dollars, slightly lower than the previous day by 20,000 dollars. Trading was quiet, and sentiment was weak, with a generally pessimistic outlook. Factory silk, 75% evenness, ordinary quality, had over ten bales purchased yesterday at a price of 2.125 million dollars. The price of raw silk for users was relatively stable. Dried silk was being purchased by Hangzhou merchants, with asking prices increased by 40,000 to 50,000 dollars, but transactions were scarce. Silk fabrics continued to be strong. American-Asian quilt covers rose by 10,000 dollars per hundred. Dachang checkered crepe was 4,360 dollars per yard, an increase of 50 dollars from the previous day. Hangzhou fabrics like Luo and spun silk were reportedly increasing in price across the board due to increased labor costs. Shengze goods were no exception. It is reported that local taxes will be levied soon, further increasing costs in Shanghai.

### Woolen and White Goods Decline

The woolen market, due to the seasonal lull and reduced pre-sales, saw buyers from this area and elsewhere delaying purchases. Except for seasonal goods selling well, most items were average. Yesterday, items such as white broadcloth, white straight tribute, white canvas, and top-quality white Shetland were generally declining in price. Their selling prices had reached their peak, and even with a drop of two to three thousand dollars per yard, they were still difficult to sell. High laundry costs and the high cost of living were also contributing factors.

### New Roasted Green Tea from Huzhou Looks Promising

Domestic tea sales of various types were seen by shops and dealers in this area and in Suzhou, Wuxi, Tianjin and other places, so buying interest was maintained. Supply also responded quickly, so the trend continued to be firm. However, the new roasted green tea from Huzhou has been favored by the industry since its introduction. Unfortunately, both arrivals and inventory of this type are scarce. Although negotiations are underway, holders are heavily speculating, and the outlook is expected to be bright.

### Sugar Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday's sugar market saw spot shortages, and prices continued to rise. The association's quoted price for medium-grade white granulated sugar was 72,500 dollars, later rising to 73,500 dollars, an increase of 1,500 dollars. The company's warehouse price was 68,500 to 69,500 dollars, a similar increase. Four-and-a-half carloads of white sugar was 94,500 dollars, an increase of 2,500 dollars. Raw sugar was 65,000 dollars. Local cotton white sugar was 77,000 to 77,500 dollars, an increase of 1,500 dollars. Xinghua red sugar was 57,500 to 60,000 dollars. Xinghua white sugar was 70,000 to 72,000 dollars.

### Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau Explains Recent Raw Silk Inspection Situation

Raw silk exports account for a large proportion of China's export trade, and all parties attach great importance to this for the development of international trade. Cai Wuji, Director of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, issued the following statement regarding the Bureau's work on raw silk inspection: (1) Regarding the quality of raw silk, the raw silk currently inspected is mostly old silk from several years ago, with poor toughness. In addition to limiting domestic sales of silk gum that has deteriorated and moldy silk, and prohibiting export, the Bureau strictly inspects other slightly damaged silk, issues a quality inspection certificate, and lists the inspection results in detail, so that exporters can choose accordingly. (2) Regarding transportation vessels, due to the recent lack of sea transport vessels, the inspected raw silk is often delayed in export due to waiting for shipping schedules, or the inspection results are inevitably affected due to poor storage or careless handling. Therefore, the quality inspection certificate issued by the Bureau has instructions on the storage and time after inspection to indicate restrictions. (3) Regarding inspection work, honesty and speed are the Bureau's consistent policy. However, since the resumption of the Bureau after the victory and the start of inspection on February 21 this year, the housing is narrow, and the human, financial, and equipment resources are far inferior to those before the war. However, it still strives to overcome difficulties. For raw silk, it cooperates with the China Sericulture Company, and in addition to the specified time, it inspects overtime every day, and the quantity has doubled. Since April, it has averaged 4,000 bales per month, and it will continue to find ways to increase it in the future to increase the export trade of raw silk.

### Continued Imports of American and Indian Cotton

[Our Newspaper] The American Steel Company's "Flascoe," carrying 4,000 bales of cotton from Seattle, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and is currently unloading at floating docks 16 and 17. Furthermore, the British Company's manager "Stanhal," carrying 27,300 tons of cotton from Karachi, arrived at Wusong anchorage on Tuesday and is expected to be imported tomorrow, scheduled to berth at Qichang Warehouse for unloading.

Furthermore, the Minsheng Company's "Minzu Transport" departed from Shanghai this morning directly to XuanChang, carrying 250 pieces of cloth and over 100 pieces of cotton yarn for shipment to Yi and transferred to Yu (Chongqing).

### New Taiwanese Grain Arrives

(Taipei, May 31st Dispatch) The supply of grain in Taiwan Province has recently been abundant, and rice prices have gradually declined. In addition, this year's harvest in Kaohsiung, Pingtung, and other places is still abundant, and new grain has already arrived on the market at a selling price of only about 1,000 dollars per 100 catties.

### Transportation Prices for Sichuan Grain Have Been Set by the Ministry of Food

The transportation prices for 30,000 tons of grain transported from Sichuan to relieve Beijing and Shanghai have been set by the Ministry of Food and various shipping companies: (1) Chongqing to Yichang is 91.200 dollars per ton, plus a return-trip subsidy of 57.000 dollars; (2) Chongqing to Hankou is 124.800 dollars per ton, plus a return-trip subsidy of 78,000 dollars; (3) Chongqing to Beijing is 158.400 dollars per ton, plus a return-trip subsidy of 99,000 dollars. The above transportation prices are equivalent to the transportation prices for commercial goods, and the return-trip subsidy is a subsidy, which all shipping companies are satisfied with.

[Another Dispatch] President Chiang's hand order in mid-month called for accelerating the transport of Sichuan grain. The Ship Allocation Committee immediately increased the allocation of ships and strengthened the transport from Chongqing to Yichang. However, after the ships arrived in Yichang, they continued to sail downstream for various reasons, so the transport volume from Chongqing to Yichang was actually small. According to statistics, from May 1st to 27th, a total of 1,345 tons were transported.

### Another State-Owned Enterprise: China Petroleum Corporation; Total Capital Temporarily Set at 100 Billion National Currency; Weng Wenhao Appointed Chairman of the Board and General Manager

The state-owned China Petroleum Corporation was officially established at 9:00 yesterday morning. Weng Wenhao, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the Board of the company, came to Shanghai from Nanjing to preside over the opening ceremony, which was very simple. The economic community in the city congratulated him. The total capital of the company is temporarily set at 100 billion national currency. The General Manager is also held by Chairman Weng, and the Assistant Managers are Zhang Zihui, Jin Kaiying, Yan Shuang, and Guo Keshe. It is reported that all enemy and puppet petroleum factories will be handed over to the company for takeover. According to Weng, due to China's industrial backwardness, the geological aspect was also lacking in detailed investigation and records in the past. Before the War of Resistance, only small-scale oil field exploration work was carried out in Shaanxi. Until after the war against Japan broke out, due to the enemy blockade of the coast, foreign oil supplies were cut off. In order to persist in the War of Resistance and increase fuel production, the government established the Gansu Oil Mining Bureau with the greatest strength and determination. After geological surveys, drilling and mining, and oil refining in the Laojunmiao area of Yumen County in Gansu Province, nine oil fields were completed, with a monthly oil production of more than 400,000 gallons. This oil completely supplied the Northwest transportation and made a great contribution to the War of Resistance. And in Sichuan Province, the Longchang, Nanan Petroleum Gully, and Jiangyou areas, after years of effort by experts, have completed the geological and drilling projects. There is now natural gas production, and it is generally believed that the three places have abundant oil reserves. The Sichuan Oil Mining Exploration Office is currently responsible for the mining and oil refining design projects. The oil mines and refineries in Taiwan received after the victory, although the factories and mines are slightly scaled, the oil production is very small, so the oil fields are also lacking. The company will add new oil refining machinery to Taiwan Province in the future in order to increase production. In the Northeast, there are also several oil refineries received, which are all using coal to refine oil, such as the Jinxi Oil Refinery and the Dalian Oil Refinery. According to the investigation results, the equipment is complete, but the output is limited. Now that the company has been established, it will supervise the national oil mines and oil refineries and start work one by one according to the steps, and the technology and equipment of each factory and mine will also be improved and added according to the actual situation, hoping that in a few years, China's oil can be self-sufficient. Weng does not plan to stay in Shanghai for a long time. The daily affairs of the Shanghai company will be handled by the Assistant Manager. Assistant Manager Jin Kaiying is also allowed to fly to the oil mining areas in Taiwan Province within days for further detailed investigation.

### Business Summary

### Textile and Construction Host News Media to Report on Recent Business Overview; Daily Production of Shanghai Factories: 1,000 Bales of Cotton Yarn, 20,000 Pieces of Cloth, and Yongjun Cotton

China Textile Construction Company yesterday afternoon specially invited the city's news media, by the business office deputy director Zhang Silu and Jiang Dixian, etc. reported, according to Yun: "Textile Construction Company recently Shanghai part of the textile factories start work has become more smooth, cotton arrived increased, spinning and weaving machine parts of the lack of problems are gradually resolved, skilled workers have returned, so the start work situation has achieved a better turn, start yarn spindles cloth machines gradually increased according to plan, day and night operation, daily production of cotton yarn of 1,000 pieces, cotton cloth of more than 20,000 pieces, cotton yarn in addition to a part of the factory self-use, the rest of the production of yarn and cloth, are sold in large quantities, in order to supplement the postwar domestic yarn and cloth is insufficient. According to the mid-May report, Qingdao's started spindles had increased to 173,408, and cloth machines to 4,217. Tianjin's started spindles had reached 177,058, and cloth machines to 5,097, which are still being actively increased. The production of Qingdao's factories is about 150 pieces of cotton yarn and 3,000 pieces of cloth per day, and the factories in Tianjin produce 148 pieces of yarn and 4,000 pieces of cloth per day. Due to insufficient electricity and lack of parts in the textile factories in the above two places, only daytime work is started.

In terms of business, due to the domestic shortage of cotton goods, the government has listed the export of cotton yarn and cloth as a ban, and temporarily adjusts the domestic needs and stabilizes the market price. The products sold are all spot goods, and no futures are sold to prevent hoarding and speculation. Taking the market price at the beginning of January this year as the base number 100, the main price changes in May were rice 785, oil 308, coal 238, cooked food 215, and 20-count yarn was only 148, and 12-pound fine cloth was 140, and the yarn and cloth showed a stable image.

According to the person in charge of the company's business office, in order to take into account the needs of yarn and cloth in various places and the parity price, the company is actively shipping goods to Chongqing, Guangdong, Tianjin, Yihang and other places for flat sale. The United States and Mexico have recently arrived in large quantities and need to be sorted out urgently, so they will not be able to respond to sales in the first and second phases. Once the internal sorting is completed, they will be sold as usual.

### Cocoon Loans of 15 Billion; Zhejiang Cocoon Crop Best in Jiaxing

The 35-year spring cocoon loan syndicate of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces was established on the 7th of last month, with a total loan amount of 20 billion. The method is that the syndicate manages the funds and allocates receipts and payments, and the China Sericulture Company supervises the use and distribution of loans. It is reported that there are 53 silk companies that have been approved by the company, including 89 silk factories and 528 cocoon businesses. As of yesterday, the approved and paid loans have exceeded 15.2 billion. As for the loan standard, it is based on the number of silk vehicles of each company's affiliated silk factory, its production efficiency, power and cooking inspection equipment, etc. Each silk vehicle is purchased from three to twelve loads of dry cocoons as the standard. According to statistics from the China Sericulture Company, a 10 billion yuan loan is sufficient for use.

Also, Zhejiang Province's silkworm breeding has more local species, so the cocoon crop is also earlier. For example, places such as Wuxi are all improved, so it is slightly later. Recently, they began to be busy with purchases, and the spring cocoon harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year is best in Jiaxing, Zhejiang.

### Prelude to the Retreat of Cantonese Communist Armed Personnel to the North; Our Newspaper's Guangzhou Air Dispatch on the 25th; Special Correspondent Liang Feng

A Long-Pending Issue Comes to a Conclusion

The issue of the Chinese Communist armed personnel in eastern Guangdong, along the East River, has been in dispute since last year. The Chinese Communists claim to have a certain number of troops there, but the General Headquarters argue that there are no Communist troops, only bandits. If they were troops, they would have unit designations and clear banners. Since they have no unit designations but are armed, they are naturally bandits. Thus, each side stuck to its position, and the issue remained unresolved from last year to this year.

On January 25th of this year, the 8th Group of the Peiping Military Mediation Department arrived here, including U.S. representative Colonel Miller, Communist representative General Fang Fang, and government representative Major Gong Weile. However, after their arrival, they could not begin their mediation work until the existence of Communist troops here was confirmed. The issue remained unresolved even after General Zhang Fakui and Mr. Zhou Enlai had private talks in Nanjing. Later, the representatives of the Three-Man Group Military Delegation, Colonel Cha Min, government representative Colonel Pi Zonggan, and Communist representative Cheng Zhi, came to Guangdong and consulted with the 8th Group and the authorized representative of the General Headquarters, Fu Du. The General Headquarters, complying with the following three principles instructed by Chairman Chiang, assisted in the implementation.

(1) The boarding location is Dapeng Bay.
(2) The number is over two thousand (not to exceed three thousand).
(3) The time is limited to one month, from the date of the start of the investigation to the date of boarding, and must not exceed.

Under these three principles, the General Headquarters representative negotiated ten resolutions with the delegation, including the transportation of 2,400 Communist armed personnel from the southern and northern regions of the East River and the northern Guangdong region to the Dapeng Peninsula, where they would board American ships and disembark in Yantai, Shandong, as well as specific details regarding the withdrawal of the Communist armed personnel. Thus, this long-pending issue was finally brought to a conclusion.

### Communist Armed Personnel Begin Retreat to the North

These resolutions were announced on April 4th. However, by mid-May, these so-called non-bandits Communist armed personnel not only delayed their departure but also, during the relocation of troops stationed in the northern and southern regions of the East River, engaged in large-scale disturbances, looting everywhere, kidnapping and extorting, killing people, and extorting road tolls. This could not help but make the people of Guangdong worry again. Everyone was wondering: Are they really going to leave? When will they finally leave?

Finally, news came out on May 23rd that the Communist armed personnel had scheduled their retreat to the north, and that May 25th was set as the first day of the one-month period agreed upon. If no new problems arise, they should be completely withdrawn by June 24th according to the agreement.

### Four Executive Subgroups, Withdrawal Procedure

Regarding their centralized withdrawal, the 8th Group already had a meticulous plan, which was implemented in accordance with the agreement. Four executive subgroups, A, B, C, and D, were sent to the southern, northern, and northern Guangdong regions of the East River. The routes and withdrawal procedures distributed by these four subgroups were as follows: Groups A and B, from Sandu Zhu to Pingshan, concentrated in Danshui on the third day. Group C, from Henghe to Longxi, Jinlong, arrived in Danshui for concentration on the third day. The longest route was Group D, from Fuxi in northern Guangdong, arriving in Zhoutian on the first day, and then, in order, passing through Datang, Longkou, Shatian, Zhangkeng, Baimang, Huilong, and Yazaipu on a daily basis to reach Danshui. A total of nine days to reach Danshui, then concentrated and moved to Dapeng Bay to prepare to board the ship. During the waiting period, they were stationed in Huangyuyong, Xintian, Pingshan Hui, Henggang Hui, and Shatoujiao. During their stay, U.S. medical personnel examined their physical condition and performed vaccinations and inoculations to prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases. The procedure for transporting the baggage train and boarding personnel was thoroughly discussed by the 8th Group and the Communist representative. After the date was determined, the U.S. ships were notified to prepare to transport these 2,400 Communist armed personnel to Yantai. The U.S. military's first group, including military transport, communications, and medical personnel, totaling fourteen people, led by Colonel Deling, had already arrived in Kowloon from Shanghai and was about to go to Dapeng Bay to assist the 8th Group's work.

### Develop Medals and Signs for Protection Along the Way

For the convenience and safety of the executive subgroups and the Communist personnel during concentration, they developed some medals and signs. The executive subgroup personnel had heart-shaped armbands, blue on top with the white characters "Military Mediation," and red on the bottom with three white circles and a rectangular red-bordered breast badge. The Communist personnel had square flags, with a red triangle in the upper left and a white triangle in the lower right, with the words "Guangdong Communist Armed Personnel, Group/Team" written horizontally below. The flags were raised in front and behind the team for identification. In addition, each person was issued a blue-bordered breast badge with the words "Guangdong Communist Armed Personnel" on top and the name, age, and number below. These badges were issued by the 8th Group with a stamp. There was also a "Guangdong Communist Armed Personnel Reintegration Certificate," which was printed with the following text: "In accordance with the mediation of the Representatives of the Three-Man Conference, the armed personnel of this unit, except for 2,400 who will be transported to Shandong by U.S. ships for concentration, will all be reintegrated. Wang Heng, Major General, Representative of the Commissioner of the Guangzhou General Headquarters, has decided to guarantee non-discrimination. Comrade ×××, of Unit ×××, has been approved for reintegration and will return to × Province, × County. It is hoped that the military camps along the way will provide protection, and the local government of the member's hometown will provide settlement and employment. Given to ××× for safekeeping.

### All Expenses Required for Retreat to the North Have Been Resolved

Secondly, regarding the expenses required for the Communist personnel to retreat to the north, the General Headquarters has borrowed 373.686 million national currency from the Communist side, of which 100 million has been given to the Communist representative, and the rest has been used by the General Headquarters to purchase grain, which will be paid after the purchased grain is converted to funds. In this way, the main difficulties in the retreat of the Communist armed personnel have been largely resolved.

At the 8th Group's reception for reporters on the 23rd, Communist representative Fang Fang said: "This retreat of the Guangdong Communist armed personnel to the north is to implement the promise of 'retreating armed personnel south of the Yangtze River,' and peace is the demand of the people of the whole country. This move by the Chinese Communists is enough to comfort the elders of Guangdong..."

Here, some may ask: Why was it said that there were no Communist troops here at first? This can be answered by General Wang Heng, representative of the General Headquarters, in his speech at the banquet hosted by Communist representatives Fang Fang and Hui Sheng on the 22nd for the U.S. military representatives of the 8th Group, the General Headquarters, and government representatives. He said: "In the past, the Communist armed forces had no unit designations or clear flags. It was impossible to distinguish between troops and bandits, and the issue of public order was of paramount importance, so pacification work was carried out. This did not mean that the Communist personnel were bandits. Later, the Peiping Military Mediation Department telegraphed that Director Zhang fully respected the opinions of the Military Mediation Department and established the Northern Mediation Agreement..."

### Special Compilation on the Headquarters’ Organization: A Record of Atrocities

In short, the retreat northward of the Communist armed forces is what the people of Guangdong truly desire. Regardless of whether they were Communist soldiers or bandits in the past, the facts of their ravaging of local areas, robbery, and massacres are too numerous to mention. We can see this from the memorandum issued by the Headquarters yesterday, numbered 行字第廿三 to the Eighth Group. It stated, in part: "The Headquarters has repeatedly received complaints from the people of the Beijiang area that, in recent months, scattered bandits in Beijiang have been causing disturbances towards the border of Jiangxi, looting Changjiang Market twice. Furthermore, on April 19th, they abducted Deng Juntang, the deputy chief of Changjiang Township, and Zhou Zhenmin, Liu Yuchao, and three other merchants, seizing all their property. Evidence found in documents proves that these actions were purely committed by armed personnel from the Communist side. Such inhumane acts of massacre and harm to people's lives and property by the Communists should be the responsibility of the Communist side for compensation, as requested by your group…" It also stated: "In recent months, Communist armed personnel have been colluding with bandits everywhere, taking advantage of the period before the start of the Northern Transportation to commit countless robberies and massacres. We have compiled a 'Record of Communist Atrocities' detailing the most egregious of these incidents, attached for your review, and respectfully request that it be included as part of your investigation materials…" Although this "Record of Communist Atrocities" has not been published, it is clearly titled as such, and we can naturally understand its meaning.

### Oriental Venice: The Charm of Liangxi

— Wuxi, 20th [of May] Dispatch, Gao Wuhong

Wuxi, a major town on the Nanjing-Shanghai railway line, a land of fish and rice with beautiful mountains and rivers, prosperous industry and commerce, and stunning scenery, has a population of over one million. People call it "Little Shanghai." This Jiangnan water town is also sometimes referred to as "Oriental Venice" along with Suzhou, but many who have visited Wuxi say that Wuxi possesses an even richer "Venetian" charm. Wuxi is also known as Liangxi and Ronghu. Another name is Xishen, because Mount Xi was originally named Mount Xishen. Legend has it that Mount Xi originally produced tin, but the tin mines were eventually exhausted, hence the name Wuxi (Without Tin). After the founding of the Republic of China, Jinqui County was also incorporated into the territory of Wuxi.

### Backed by Mountains, Surrounded by Water, Facing Taihu Lake

During the occupation, Wuxi was battered by artillery fire, and almost all of its best features were destroyed, leaving behind ruins and desolation. Everyone thought that after this catastrophe, it would be difficult to restore the city to its former glory, but the people of Wuxi possess an unbelievable capacity for reconstruction. Before long, the destroyed buildings in the bustling areas were gradually rebuilt. By the time the enemy surrendered, it had been completely restored as a magnificent city, and due to the rapid increase in population and the importance of political, military, industrial, and commercial aspects, it is even more prosperous and lively than in the past.

Before the war, Wuxi already had a plan to demolish the city walls and build a ring road. According to the current population and the development of industry and commerce, Wuxi may be re-established as a municipality in the future. Therefore, there are plans to widen all important streets to eight meters in the future to meet the conditions for establishing a municipality. The second is to demolish the city walls and build a ring road. In addition, there are plans to repair the Seventy-Two-Ring-Hole Stone Arch Bridge, which was destroyed when the National Army withdrew, and to build a model new village. Regarding these matters, the Construction Department of the County Government has prepared a detailed plan, which will be implemented soon. After the plan to build the new Wuxi is realized, we can sit in a car, enjoy the full view of Wuxi, and tour the scenic spots of Wuxi.

"To appreciate the charm of the Six Dynasties, build a thatched cottage by Mochou Lake." The reporter believes that if you want to "appreciate the charm of Wuxi scenery," then you must "tour the scenic spots around the lake." In terms of mountains, Wuxi's famous scenic spots include Huiquan Mountain, where the Second Spring Pavilion is well-known. As for the lakefront, there are Liyuan Garden, Yuzhuang Village, Dongda Pond, Meiyuan Garden, Xiaojishan Mountain, and Turtle Head Isle, all of which are destinations for tourists. Backed by mountains, surrounded by water, facing Taihu Lake, there is a unique majestic scenery. Compared with West Lake, one is a graceful maiden, and the other is a towering hero. Of course, the scenery of Wuxi inevitably lacks a sense of curvilinear beauty.

After the war, all the buildings in these places were demolished. In particular, Meige Pavilion only has a fragmented outline left. Doors and windows have disappeared without a trace. When people reflect on the past and lament the present, they can't help but feel infinite sorrow.

The most luxurious enjoyment for tourists is to hire a motorboat, plus a brightly painted and spacious barge, to take you to visit various places. The boatman can also prepare a sumptuous Wuxi boat meal for you. However, this expense is not affordable for the average person.

### Smokers Go Up the Mountain: Group Smoking Cessation

Today, when the eradication of opium is being carried out vigorously, Wuxi is also taking the same steps as other places. Without prior self-registration, a strict search found a total of 451 smokers. This group of smokers has been concentrated in the Wanan Zen Temple on Zhongdu Mountain for compulsory detoxification, giving them a chance to start anew.

Zhongdu Mountain is a small island in Taihu Lake. Wanan Zen Temple is located on the top of the mountain on this island. The location is very desolate, and people rarely visit it at ordinary times. Choosing this place is also a good way for them to repent. Among the four hundred smokers, women accounted for one-tenth. The age ranges from seventy-two to eighteen years old, and the eighteen-year-old is a woman. There is also a monk among them. All kinds of people from all walks of life are gathered here.

The mountain is heavily guarded, with a sentry every fifty steps. Smokers can't even think about crossing the line. A supervision office has also been established to manage these smokers. The smokers' lives are very hard, and their food is rough. They have a deep feeling of "knowing today, regretting not in the first place." I hope they can train themselves in hardship and start a new life!

### Cultural and Educational Undertakings Are Gradually Becoming Active

Jiangsu Provincial Xishi Teachers' College, Jiangsu Educational Institute, and Wuxi Guoxue College have been restored. The school buildings of Private Xizhong were destroyed and cannot be restored. Except for Furen Middle School, the rest have also moved back to Wuxi, gradually returning to the pre-war state.

National Fudan University and the Frontier School have decided to move to Wuxi. Fudan's school buildings are at Daleizui, and the Frontier School has chosen the Taihu Hotel and Zongjing Villa in Meiyuan Garden as school buildings. As soon as the construction is completed, they will move to Wuxi to start classes. In the beautiful environment, Wuxi, this ancient city that has put on new clothes, will go further and occupy an important position in education.

Before the war, Wuxi's newspaper industry ranked first among local newspapers. During the occupation, the newspapers were under the control of the enemy and puppets, and only one "official" "Wuxi Daily" was full of absurdity and had no achievements. After the war, the newspaper industry took the opportunity to rise, and the newspaper industry, which had been silent for eight years, became lively. There are now four daily newspapers: Xibao, Jiangsu Minbao Wuxi Edition, Renbao, and Daxibao. Except for Daxibao, the other three have their own printing facilities. In addition to competing in business, there are few improvements in layout and content.

The more commendable one is Xibao, with its new layout and fast news. It also has dispatches from special correspondents from all over the world. The editorials do not seem to be too important. The supplement is biased towards the Shanghai style, which, from a business point of view, is to cater to the psychology of readers. Strictly speaking, it is somewhat low-level.

Wuxi is a large rice market and a distribution center for rice and grain. Rice and paddy from the surrounding rice-producing areas are concentrated in Wuxi and then transported to various ports. Therefore, the amount of rice and grain stored in Wuxi and the rise and fall of prices are enough to affect the entire rice market.

This time, the skyrocketing rice price, as observed by the reporter, is mainly due to the Shanghai Grain Administration issuing a huge amount of grain loan funds. The rice worms got this money and went to various production and sales areas to purchase. The local rice reserves were gradually emptied by them, forming a phenomenon that supply exceeded demand. Within a month, the rice price in Wuxi jumped from 27,000 yuan to over 60,000 yuan. The culprits should first ask the rice merchants who got the grain loan funds!

This time, the soaring rice price seems to be a planned action by the rice worms. Banning exports and forcibly suppressing prices are not fundamental solutions, but only create better opportunities for unscrupulous merchants. Now, just ask them: Do you want to starve to death the compatriots who have suffered from war after seeing today's victory? (May 20th)

### A Plea for the Compatriots of Northern Jiangsu!

Editor: For the sake of human justice, for the sake of world civilization, and even more for the sake of our suffering people of Northern Jiangsu, I respectfully appeal to the government, and appeal to just people in society, hoping that the government will pay attention, and hoping that people in society will provide relief, to save Northern Jiangsu from its misfortune, and quickly save our people who have fallen into the "Liberated Zone"!

Ever since the New Fourth Army arrived in Northern Jiangsu, the people have not had a single day of peace. The fat of both the rich and the poor has been squeezed dry. What is most heartbreaking is that they loudly shouted the slogan of "fighting the Japanese devils," but in the end, they did not fire a single shot. Instead, they completely gave the towns and cities of Northern Jiangsu to the enemy, causing us to suffer the life of a subjugated slave for several years unjustly. And what did they do? They engaged in behind-the-lines movements, using the guise of resisting the enemy to seduce young people, using local thugs, and using unscrupulous means to deceive, plunder, and destroy, trying to expand their military power and extend their territory day by day, regardless of the life or death of the people.

After Japan surrendered, their fake anti-Japanese sign lost its effect. At the same time, the stimulus of rent reduction, tenancy strike, and strikes no longer aroused the interest of farmers. So, they staged an extremely barbaric tragedy, the so-called "forty-five days of great struggle, no democracy within three months"! That is, landlords were killed, middle peasants were killed, rich peasants were killed, bosses were killed, gentry were killed, intellectuals were killed, local self-government personnel were killed, rural military and political party members were killed, and impartial ordinary people were also killed. They were killed one by one, and the relatives and friends of the victims were also implicated. They called it the work of removing the root of the tumor.

In recent months, the people of Northern Jiangsu have been dying, fleeing, filling the household [with corpses], and those who cannot leave are waiting for the arrival of the god of death, living a life of suffering like ants on a hot pot. Every day, they mobilize a group of local thugs to find you to confess, to find you to fight, forcing you to create debts out of nothing, forcing you to confess to trumped-up charges (Nationalist spies, hoping for the Central Government, undercover agents, and what kind of curved line, comfortable, economic, ideal, mobile, etc. traitors), and then tell you to first suffer live torture, and then suffer the death penalty, and then add the punishment of confiscating property. Their achievements are indeed not bad. The following is a summary of their recent brutal performances and secretive deployments: (1) Killing: Their killings have no factual basis, no legal standards, and are promoted by the county government sending the government to various districts. The so-called "suppression of traitors" work rewards local thugs for reporting good people, and mobilizes militiamen to hold meetings to make public decisions. On the surface, it holds public trials, but in fact, it has been secretly decided long ago. The victims are first beaten to death, and then stabbed with knives indiscriminately. The families are not allowed to collect the bodies, and the corpses are exposed in the fields to feed the dogs. The number of people in Northern Jiangsu who have been sacrificed under this cruel torture is countless. For example, Liu Shouming, Liu Mianzai, Miao Kejun, Miao Lianbai, Zhou Youmin, Cai Shunyan, Cai Junjie, etc. in Dongtai County, they either have a little knowledge, or a little property, or a little reputation. Because they are not used and not deceived, they are suspected and inexplicably killed.

(2) People's Prison: This is also a kind of punishment that mobilizes the militia to suggest public decision. The victims are sentenced to a certain period of imprisonment, with a wooden sign of a prisoner hanging on their necks, shackles nailed to their feet, and they supply their own prison rations. If they take a step out of the house, anyone can beat them to death. There are too many people suffering from this crime, such as Huang Xitao in, Qian Buqing, Wu Shuhai, Wu Shanzhi in Shuangdian, Cai Zhongheng, Miao Xiusheng, Xu Linan, Miao Chengcheng, Kang Hanchen, and Miao Xixuan in Tea, who are temporarily exchanging their lives under this kind of punishment.

(3) Tattooing: This is a disguised form of people's prison, which is popular in Chahe, Matang, and other areas of Rufou County. The so-called Ming traitors (those who participated in puppet organizations), the greedy traitors (those who did not participate in puppet organizations, but were mobilized by them with the militia, indicating the rogue, insisting that you are an ideal traitor, a curved-line traitor), the Chiang Kai-shek faction, Nationalist spies (leaning towards the central government or having Kuomintang membership), if they escaped the death penalty, they could not escape ink torture. The words "traitor" are tattooed on your forehead, and a certain area is designated for you to move around. If you leave the circle, you will be killed without pardon.

(4) Parading through the streets and villages: This is the most common punishment. In the towns of the Liberated Zone, gongs and drums are played every day, and the streets are paraded. All men and women wearing long gowns and cheongsams are hard to escape. For example, Ren Xiaoan in Shuangdian, Liu Zeren in Rushishi, Li Zheng in Chahe, and Miss Han Er in Hai'an were reported by the gangsters, wearing paper-bag hats and parading in red cloth pants.

(5) Confiscation and Fines: Many people have already been sentenced to death or imprisonment, but this is not enough. In addition, the farmland is confiscated, the houses are demolished, and you are killed and your property is emptied, so that everything is clear. For those who can barely make ends meet, their government encourages local thugs to settle accounts with you. Again and again, the endless accounts are settled, and each settlement is a fine. Hundreds of loads and five hundred loads are spoken casually. If you can't get them out, the farmland will be auctioned, the houses will be demolished, and if it's not enough, you have to sell your sons and daughters to settle it. For example, Liu Zhoucheng, Ren Jiyu, Xie Yuan, and Ji Yucheng in Libao, Miao Yunong and Miao Boming in , Chen Zhonghua in Juegang, etc. have all suffered this kind of bankruptcy loss.

(6) Kowtowing: People sentenced to this kind of punishment are fined to kowtow along the door, which is a kind of lingering punishment. You will bleed and slowly die within a day. For example, Zhang Qiangjiu and Wu Mou in Fengli, Guo Yukun and Chen Zaitang in Matang, etc. all died under the kowtow punishment.

(7) Special Organizations: (1) Smelling incense team, specializes in investigating which family eats well. Once found, they come to the door to struggle and identify. (2) The eavesdropping team is a more powerful organization than Zhou Lizheng's censorship. They listen in the streets and alleys during the day, and hide in people's doorways and corners at night, listening to family whispers. If there are private words complaining about their tyranny, you will be killed on the third day.

(8) Others: (A) There are many tricks, too many to count. There is also the punishment of hoping for the central government, hanging people high on a tree and asking if you see the central government. Then the rope is untied, and you fall into a puddle of flesh. (B) A person surnamed Zhang in Rufou said in a teahouse: "Eat more and talk less." He was fined to eat twenty bowls of rice. As a result, his stomach and intestines burst, and he died immediately. (C) During the Lantern Festival in the first month, there was a lantern riddle "Japan surrenders," playing a famous ancient person. At that time, someone guessed it was "Qu Yuan." They were not very satisfied and insisted that it was "Su Wu." Everyone, what do you think is the reason for this? (D) Those who are considered sinners by them are all listed on the paper list, posted for circulation. The executed prisoners are written on the white list, those who have been punished and temporarily released are written on the green list, and those who have not been sentenced are placed on the yellow list. But those who have not been sentenced and those who have not died should be happy for the time being, because there is a good chance that your yellow list will be promoted to the green list, and the green list will be promoted to the white list. (E) At first, they used candles to confuse workers and peasants and launched struggles. The grain they demarcated was unable to be paid by the capitalists. They sold the farmland to the tenant farmers at auction. The price of the land was used to pay for the fines, and each household was required to pay 200 catties of rice per mu for the tax deed fee. In this way, they obtained countless food, which they transported away by sea, causing famine in Northern Jiangsu.

At first, we were fascinated and hoped that the Political Consultative Conference would be successful and that China would peacefully enter democracy. But the facts tell us that the Communist Party has no sincerity at all for the word "consultation," but uses the name of consultation to delay time, expand its territory, and wait for an opportunity to satisfy their ambition to redden the whole country. Therefore, they have recently killed and expelled non-party people, burned books and buried scholars, emulating the First Emperor of Qin, forcing young and strong people to fill their military power as much as possible, searching for materials, attacking the National Army, destroying the system, and loudly calling for the slogan of liberating the five continents (Tongzhou, Yangzhou, Taizhou, Xuzhou, Zhengzhou). Therefore, the more lenient the government is, the more the Communist Party will expand, and the more the people will be ravaged! If you don't believe it, please come to the "Liberated Zone" and taste the taste of their "democracy"!

Their most recent secret grassroots organization and deployment in the Liberated Zone is a very strict and extremely dangerous organization. (The following is the structure in one of their townships.)

(1) Township (Town) Government: Under the command and supervision of the instructor, the township (town) chief and deputy lead the following five organizations: (A) Grain Restoration and Micro-Collection: The director leads the cashier, investigator, manager, and accountant to manage the search of grain, taxes, and materials in the whole township (town). (B) Village and Group: According to the terrain and area of the whole township, several villages and several groups are divided, controlling several households and several strong men, and promoting all their administration. (C) School: In addition to implementing children's education, there are several hours of adult education every day, the purpose is to adopt the purpose of education and change of thought. (D) Conscription and Military Service: The regiment leader leads the two groups of preferential treatment and consolation, attracting young and strong people by any means, and attracting blind followers, with the principle of achieving the goal. (E) Personnel Research: The autonomous secret leadership leads the research and reconnaissance of two groups, using unscrupulous means to investigate, research, the remarks and beliefs of the three-capital elements, and the military, political, and party members in the field, whether there are hostile trends, how can they be used, and how to attack and eradicate all kinds of conspiracies.

(2) Militia Brigade: The instructor supervises the brigade commander (deputy) to command the following three organizations: (A) Militia sub-team: The principle of compiling is one sub-team per village, and three or four villages per company. During the active period, several brigades can be assembled at any time to form a national camp, distribute weapons, such as rifles, grenades, bayonets, etc., to serve as the outer perimeter warning of its main force, or the vanguard force during the attack. (B) Backbone Team (formerly known as Model Team): Selected from the militia to form a strong man. They are often equipped with weapons, long and short guns, grenades, bayonets, and sometimes equipped with light machine guns and grenade launchers. They move in the area. The military appearance is young and strong, sometimes disguised, sometimes armed, the lineup is sometimes neat and sometimes sparse, and even lurking motionless, it is not easy to detect. His activities are sometimes like a storm, and sometimes like a few morning stars. (C) Special Agent Team: Selected excellent members from the very backbone team, strictly organized, led by the team leader to destroy, contact, kill (also known as removing traitors), enemy work, etc., four groups secretly implement all work.

(3) Civil Movement: The instructor supervises the township head (also the branch director), and the directors of the Youth, Labor, Agriculture, Commerce, Science, Students, Women, and Fishery Federations (formerly known as the Anti-Japanese Association) lead the directors and group leaders, instigate hints, mobilize blind followers, cause disputes, and create massacres. Nothing more than disturbing the society, taking advantage of Zhang Renqing, and so on, countless tricks. Above two to three townships, below the district level, there are also district party branches, party committees of various departments, security organizations (assassination leadership agencies), traffic branch stations, industrial and commercial bureaus and industrial and commercial management bureaus (specializing in searching for donations and taxes to control materials), enemy work detachments, and other leading agencies and secret organizations.

What is urgent now is the issue of summer harvest. They dispatch troops from all directions and are active in the countryside, the so-called "defending the summer harvest." At the same time, the work of their grassroots personnel is also very tense, preparing for grain levies, badges, grain offerings, fines, conscription, and other tasks of searching and expanding the army. The bitter life of the people of Northern Jiangsu, when will the time of starvation end!

The dead are gone. How will the tens of millions of refugees who have escaped from the hands of death and are living on the starvation line survive, or go back to be slaughtered by the Communist Party, or wait to starve to death outside? In addition to rescuing us, the government must know that Northern Jiangsu is close to Beijing, and it is dangerous to become a separatist situation! Therefore, the Northern Jiangsu issue is by no means a minor issue, and it must not be compromised or delayed any longer! Lv Guojun, Liu Yiguo, Miao Sicheng, Miao Yijin, Zhou Renfu, and Zhou Zaixin, representatives of the refugees in exile from Qin County and Dongtai County, Jiangsu Province, May 22, 1946.

### "Sichuan Brocade" in Poverty and Sickness

— Chengdu, 22nd Day (Air Mail) Zhou Yangquan

In terms of clothing, people consistently say "Hangzhou Silk and Suzhou Embroidery (also called Zhou Embroidery), Beijing Satin, and Sichuan Brocade" together. They are praised as the four famous products of our country, enjoying a great reputation not only domestically but also internationally as treasures. Now, leaving the first three aside for the moment, we will now give a brief introduction to the current situation of Sichuan Brocade:

Sichuan Brocade, at the mention of this name, anyone who has appreciated it will praise its artistry. Especially people from outside the province admire it and long for it. Allied friends, when they came to Chengdu in the past, were most attracted by this beautiful Sichuan Brocade. Sichuan Brocade, it has blossomed with many years of honor for Sichuan. When people think of it, they will think of Sichuan.

### Crystallization of Handicraft, Forged from Blood and Sweat

Sichuan Brocade can be said to be a crystallization of handicraft. It is forged from blood and sweat. There is no machinery involved at all; it all relies on hands, the hands of millions of people creating it. On the Chengdu Plain is the concentrated area where it is born. In the urban area of ​​Chengdu, those who specialize in Sichuan Brocade are numerous. According to investigations, before the War of Resistance, there were more than 1,000 families. Now, due to the decline of industry and commerce, it has been reduced to more than 700 families. The maximum number of looms per family is seven or eight, but those with two or three looms account for more than half. On average, each family has about three looms, which amounts to more than 2,000 looms based on 700 families. These looms are all wooden. The most common length of the loom is twelve feet, quite similar in structure to wooden weaving looms, except that the number of warp threads can be as high as eight layers. Because of this, the finished product can exhibit a silky sheen. As for the shuttle, it is also slightly longer, with iron tips about five inches long at both ends. The workers send it back and forth with their hands, little by little. The upper end of the loom where the threads are drawn is high up in the middle of the house, while the lower end where the weaving takes place is sunk below the excavated ground level. Therefore, the looms are all installed on mud ground, dug into a pit more than three feet deep.

### With Each Pass, Beautiful Patterns are Woven

Each loom requires two workers. One is called the "Upper Hand," who is responsible for pulling the threads and raising the patterns at the upper end, occasionally organizing the warp threads. The other is called the "Lower Hand," who is actually responsible for the weaving. He sits on the loom, with most of his body below the pit. The craftsmanship of the "Lower Hand" must be higher than that of the "Upper Hand." Thousands of patterns are engraved in his mind, and with each pass of his hand, he can weave various animals, birds, flowers, and all kinds of beautiful patterns. There are no models, no templates, all relying on memory. Even the most skilled painter would marvel at it.

### More Than Four Thousand Workers Live in Gloom

More than two thousand looms, more than four thousand workers, they live in gloomy, poorly ventilated old-fashioned houses. It is strange to say that finished Sichuan Brocade products are all displayed in the most prosperous downtown areas, while the places where they are made are hidden in narrow alleys and remote streets. Who would have thought that beautiful and pretty Sichuan Brocade would be born in such dusty and filthy places! They are mostly hired workers. In addition to the food and lodging provided by the owner, their wages are based on piecework. The "Lower Hand" can get more than a hundred yuan per foot, while the "Upper Hand" only gets seventy or eighty yuan per foot. A ten-foot-long quilt cover can be delivered in two days. They work from morning till night, the looms making slight clattering sounds. Their lives are dull and monotonous. On everyone's forehead are deeply carved lines of worry, their faces pale. Furthermore, due to the demanding memory required for raising patterns and dividing silk, many older people have bald heads. With no rest and no entertainment, they work like oxen, spending their arduous years from morning to night, from spring to autumn, year after year. On the walls of the house, there are wads of red silk thread that they have chewed, and those clumps of silk thread can make people mistake them for horrifying blood clots, which gives sensitive people a somewhat terrifying feeling.

It is estimated that the entire urban area can produce several thousand feet of finished products per day. Because of the shortage of funds, they rarely stock goods; most are based on orders or pre-orders from merchants. Therefore, sometimes when they accept pre-orders and silk prices rise, they not only have to weave for others with pain but also have to endure losses with pain. It is said that this year, sales have been hampered, and merchants are unwilling to buy in large quantities. In addition, this year's spring drought has greatly affected silk production, increasing the cost of purchases, making it even more difficult to sell goods, and bringing them closer to bankruptcy. A "Lower Hand" sitting on the loom told the reporter that they had to follow their master for four years when they were young. Because raising patterns and dividing silk are difficult, he has been doing it for fourteen years now, and he still feels that he has not "mastered it." With infinite sighs, he said, "Our trade can no longer be done." Seeing how many mouths and how many hands are becoming more and more convulsive in this industrial and commercial bankruptcy, the reporter left the dim workshop with a heavy heart.

### A New Look for Mount Lu: Preparing for a Summer Academic Lecture Series

— Nanchang, 25th Day (Correspondence) Deng Guihua

Mount Lu's scenery is serene and secluded, making it a famous summer resort in the country. The Jiangxi Provincial Government, with the summer vacation approaching, expects visitors from home and abroad to come to the mountain for recreation. At the same time, there is news that Chairman Chiang will also be stationed at Guling for office work and summer relaxation. Therefore, all restoration and construction projects are being carried out diligently.

The 13-kilometer road from Jiujiang to Lianhua Cave has had its renovation funds submitted to the Central Highway Administration for allocation. To save time, the Highway Department has advanced 20 million yuan from the Central Government's allocated funds for various engineering projects. The Xun (Jiujiang) -Gu (Guling) telecommunications line is currently being actively repaired by the Directorate General of Telecommunications of the Ministry of Communications and will be able to provide telegraph and telephone services in one or two weeks. The roads from Guling as the center to various famous scenic spots were completed by Japanese prisoners of war a long time ago. Scenic areas and various buildings in the mountains are also being thoroughly renovated. Chairman Chiang's residence has also been repaired and renovated. It is heard that in order to promote academics, the province will hold a summer lecture series in Mount Lu, divided into eight groups: education, physical education, English, mathematics and physics, chemistry, natural history, literature and history, geography, and art. The time is tentatively set for one month, from July 15th to August 15th. At that time, famous scholars and dignitaries will gather, and the famous mountain will surely become even more colorful. The Jiangxi Provincial Government, considering Jiujiang as the gateway to Jiangxi, which was destroyed by the enemy during the eight years of the War of Resistance and is now in a dilapidated state, has ordered the county government to renovate and refresh the three main trunk lines in order to welcome Chinese and foreign summer visitors who will soon arrive.

### Human Waste Utilization: Chengdu Smokers Dredge Riverways

— Chengdu, 26th Day (Air Mail) Zhou Yangquan

The municipal government's use of smokers to dredge the Jin River and Yu River has been completed for several months.

Recently, a primitive forest was discovered in the Shennongjia area of ​​the Wushan mountains, towering and lush, reaching into the clouds, with three types of trees. According to investigators, the timber produced in that area, if felled, could supply the needs of the entire country's railways for fifty years. Relevant authorities will jointly form a company to carry out large-scale development.

Before the National Government moved its capital, Chairman Chiang's instructions upon arriving in Chengdu were printed by the provincial government as a military handbook and distributed to various government agencies, organizations, and schools for reference. Chairman Zhang Qun of the Provincial Government, Yue Jun, wrote a "Respectful Reading" article on these instructions, attached to the end, so that readers could understand it more deeply. The separate edition is being rushed into print.

The Chengdu Municipal Government has designated South China West as an experimental demonstration district. In the recent election of Jia chiefs, university presidents, professors, etc., participated, and Zhang Linggao, president of China University, was elected as the district chief. The Bao residents' enthusiasm for registering for public office with the Municipal Government was very high. Among them, Provincial Governor Zhang Cui and University Professor Chen Zhushan will be candidates for Bao chief.

The Municipal Government is planning to build a social hall for the masses. At the same time, it will open a public theater for the masses in the Zhengzheng Public Hall (formerly renamed Shao City Public Hall). All detailed measures are being planned.

The Municipal Government is actively improving traffic in the city and has decided to renovate the road surface. It is stipulated that the center of the street will be four meters wide and made of cement, and both sides will be made of crushed coal cinders. Depending on the degree of dilapidation and traffic needs, repairs will be made in order of urgency. The materials will be paid for from the collected engineering benefit fees, and the workers will be slightly adjusted by national compulsory labor.

Sichuan Province is reforming and modeling itself as a model province. The provincial government is currently accelerating the discussion of the five-year plans of various departments. Those that have been discussed and completed include: education, construction, land administration, health, accounting, tobacco ban, security, and social affairs. The other eight departments, such as civil administration and finance, will also be completed soon.

Electricity supply in Chengdu initially stopped once every ten days, then once every three days, then every other day, and finally stopped every day and at any time. However, recently, the Qiming Electric Factory repaired the Jiaozijie and Yongni Zhai factories and announced the restoration of the three-day shutdown system. From this, we can know the content of Chengdu's electrical expertise.

The construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has been decided to start in July this year. Construction Director He Beiheng is currently in Shanghai negotiating materials.

The municipal government used smoking offenders to dredge the Jin River and Yu River, which has now been completed, which can truly be said to be "utilizing waste."

The past month or so has been an eventful autumn for the education sector in Chengdu. Three cases of shooting and murder have occurred one after another: (1) Wen Ziguang, a fourth-year student at Chenghua University, was killed by Company Commander Xie Fengchun near Songxian Bridge. (2) Zhang Guogong, a student at Lida Middle School, stabbed Zhu Peisheng, the director of training, with a sharp knife. (3) Long Shizheng, a student at Huangpu Middle School, stabbed his classmate Sun Wenzhong to death. All three cases are under investigation in the local court.

### Children of Okinawa

Children of Okinawa play outside a schoolhouse covered with thatch. The people of the island, under the supervision of the U.S. Military Government, manage their own government. After the victory, the island began construction work, which has now reached a considerable scale.

### Military-Civilian Cooperation in Zhuji. 20th Day, Zhuji Correspondence.

— Dang Dai

The Zhejiang Security Second Regiment and the 187th Division are stationed here. The officers and soldiers of the latter unit have hardly had any minor frictions with the common people. For example, they are very polite when borrowing things, and return them after use. If there is any damage, they will compensate at the price without any complaint. For example, when shopping in the street, they never argue fiercely about prices. If they can afford it, they buy it. If they can't afford it, they walk away silently. I once saw with my own eyes: Once, an officer was walking on the road and was unfortunately hit by a reckless firewood carrier, and his skin was scratched. But he didn't make a sound, immediately got up, patted off the mud (it was raining that day), and walked away as if nothing had happened.

The officers and soldiers of the 187th Division are very enthusiastic about public welfare undertakings. Recently, they selected 400 brothers to assist the county government in rushing to repair a section of road from the railway station to the city station, without receiving any hospitality, starting their own fires, and working voluntarily, and automatically decided to complete the rush repair within one month. Recently, the merchants in the urban area automatically raised money, a pig, and a jar of yellow wine, preparing to comfort them.

Movies and Drama

### Protest Against the Sale of Publicly Owned Theaters

— Kang Tai

Several cinemas in Shanghai that were taken over by the local authorities from the enemy are now publicly seeking owners and are decided to be auctioned off. It is said that the reason for the auction is that "public operation" cannot continue (or is not effective), and the income cannot offset the expenditure, resulting in too much loss, so it was decided to publicly auction them in order to obtain some cash to辦辦 other public utilities.

We do not study whether the reason for this is true, and we do not want to ask about the motive for the auction. In short, we are firmly opposed to the sale of publicly owned theaters.

Any advanced country not only has a national theater (located in the capital) but also has publicly owned separate theaters in each city. These theaters are different from the nature of private commercial ventures. Private commercial theaters will do everything possible to make money and profit, which is beyond reproach, while national theaters or publicly owned theaters, in addition to adopting the same business methods in order to use the income to maintain the theater's expenses, also focus on how to strive to use the theater as a public place for educating the public. In other words, the operation of this kind of theater is only a means, and cultural service is the minimum purpose.

Our country has always been unable to establish a national theater due to material constraints, and of course, publicly owned theaters have been even more unable to be established. This time, we were fortunate enough to take over several theaters from the enemy, and they were also beautifully called "publicly owned theaters." Unexpectedly, after less than a few months of operation, they are going to be auctioned off to businessmen again. The local authorities' measures are lacking thorough consideration. We object. As for the fact that the so-called "publicly owned theaters" have not had the slightest "public operation" effect in the past few months, it is not discussed in the final article and will be discussed later. We hope to remind everyone of this matter and ask the wise local authorities to consider it carefully. Re-do!

### China's "Spiritual Food" Famine is Serious

— Tang Shaohua

According to the survey statistics of the World Food Conference: The entire world is suffering from a serious food shortage, and China's food shortage is the most serious. But in today's Shanghai, I believe that the poverty of spiritual food, which is equally silent as the food shortage, is also very serious. In terms of general cultural publications, although there are some in quantity, there are really too few that can be called spiritual food - pitifully few!

I am closer to the film industry, so I will take the more familiar films as an example. Shanghai is the concentration of Chinese film production, but since the victory, only the Central Film Studio's Second Factory has produced a film called "The House of Loyalty and Righteousness" with great effort. Other companies are still just rumours. This kind of output is too small. There are more than 40 cinemas in Shanghai that show movies. Except for a few two or four-wheel cinemas that occasionally show two outdated old domestic films, nearly 40 cinemas regularly show foreign films (95% are American films, and the number of British and Soviet films imported is also not large). I have no intention of excluding foreign films. On the contrary, in terms of films, China is too backward, and we should welcome the supply of excellent foreign films. But the question is whether the content of the films supplied to us by foreigners is excellent? And can it be called "spiritual food"?

From the 1,300 or so American films imported by Shanghai in the nine months since the victory, more than 80% are promoted by pornography or weirdness. This kind of romantic and absurd content is most likely to affect social customs and human relations. The general public in our country is very imitative, especially for foreign bad habits, it is easier to accept, which is a very terrible and serious problem. We are losing a very large amount of foreign exchange every day, every month, and every year, and what we are getting in return is some bad influences that are harmful to our country's society and people, which is really unfair. We would like to appeal to American film producers and distributors, hoping that while relieving the world's food shortage, they will also consider the relief of "spiritual food," especially in China, where the "spiritual food" shortage is the most serious. By the way, we want to formally inform the Chinese big bosses who are in charge of distributing Hollywood films in China that while striving for "business acumen," they should also put their hands on their conscience and plan for their compatriots. We have already spent such a staggering amount of money, hoping to exchange it for a little "spiritual food" that can educate our compatriots!

"When the Lilacs Bloom Again," starring Deanna Durbin and Franchot Tone. A comical story, with pleasant songs. Opening Saturday at the Majestic.

### How to Appreciate Drama: Mr. Huang Zuolin's Lecture at Shanghai University

— Bao Zhongji

I feel that most of the drama criticism in the current newspapers and magazines focuses on the actors, and does not analyze the acting skills, but only writes some after-viewing feelings, which cannot be regarded as true drama criticism, nor is it a true attitude to appreciate drama. Then how to appreciate drama? It can be divided into three aspects.

Script Aspect: The most important thing affecting drama is the script. If the content of the script is very meaningful, the structure is very compact, and the lines are very beautiful, then it will definitely win the audience's praise during the performance; on the contrary, if the content of the script is empty, the structure is loose, and the lines are vulgar, it will definitely not get satisfactory results. Unfortunately, in the recent drama scene, we can see a trend, that is, the more meaningful the script, the lighter the box office, and the play with gimmicks as the appeal, but there are many "appreciators," which shows the decline in the audience's level, and it can also be said that they do not yet have the ability to appreciate drama.

Acting Aspect: Speaking of acting, it includes the actors' acting talent and their degree of use of body language. The talent that an ordinary actor has can be measured by five methods: that is, whether their ability to imitate, sensitivity, responsiveness, imagination, and attraction can reach the standard? Especially the ability to imitate is the most important. Although it is everyone's instinct, there are differences in degree. A good actor will be freed from the various constraints of geography, climate, social religion, and customs, so that his performance truly reaches the realm of "lifelike"; as for sensitivity, it is also a condition that every artist should have, especially when acting as an actor, it is even more necessary to have a high degree of dramatic sensitivity; responsiveness is a kind of sensitivity on stage, because the actor has to have a close relationship with other actors or stage lighting on stage, and must be able to adapt to the situation, and only paying attention to reciting the lyrics is the most undesirable. I can give an example to prove that, like a certain drama troupe with a long history, their protagonists often act in the middle of the stage, one person steals the show, so that other actors have to turn their backs to the audience to act, and actors who lack responsiveness will eventually be eliminated; also, although an actor has rich life experience, imagination is still indispensable. For example, if the script requires a scene of killing people, and they have no such experience in real life, then the actor's imagination is extremely needed at this time. They can think of the nature of killing an annoying mosquito (this is possible to get life experience). Expanding and expressing it with imagination, it will appear realistic during the performance; finally, it is necessary to mention attraction, which can be divided into two types. For example, Hollywood's selection of talents often only focuses on the appearance of attraction (appearance, physique, etc.), and today's Shanghai drama industry often makes this mistake. In fact, in addition to the appearance of attraction, there is a greater need for internal attraction such as personality and demeanor. As for the use of the actor's body, it refers to the use of the muscles of the face, torso, and limbs. There are often many actors who have no expression on their faces, or their expressions fall into a stereotype, because they only use part of the muscles, and they also need to know how to use inspiration and muscle coordination. I have seen Indian dancers who wear many copper rings on their limbs. They can use any one of the rings to make a sound. The use of this body can be said to be the most beautiful. Of course, the use of voice is also a great factor in "talk" dramas, and it can be used to assist the lack of expression.

Performance Aspect: Most of it is the director's responsibility. The director, in the performance of drama, is not only arranging the position of the actors on the stage, but the most important thing is to help the actors understand and recognize the personality of the characters in the play, but not to teach the actors to do every action. The actors of a dictatorial and autocratic director often cannot give full play to their skills, which affects the effect of the entire drama. Because drama is like a big tree, the actors are the leaves on the tree, and the director is only responsible for supplying nutrients. I think the director should read a script at least three times: the first time is pure appreciation, the second time is careful analysis, and the third time is to criticize and improve. Pay attention to the mood when rehearsing, and once it is hot, a script can be put on the stage for performance.

An audience who can pay attention to the above points is a true drama appreciator.

Drama Appreciation: 1. Script: Playwright. 2. Director. 3. Actor's acting skills: Use of body, Use of voice, Testing of talent: Imitation ability, Sensitivity, Responsiveness, Imagination, Attractiveness.

### Recent Work by Dorothy Lamour

— Jiang Xinming

"Sarong Girl" Dorothy Lamour should be quite familiar to film fans in Shanghai. Her charming eyelashes and adorable face have left an indelible impression on them. Especially in films like "Hurricane," "Typhoon," and "The Jungle Princess," her swimming and dancing were truly admirable. Since the victory, several of her films have been shown in Shanghai, including "Dixie Dugan," "Rainbow Island," and "Star Spangled Rhythm." Her performance in "Dixie Dugan" was the most critically acclaimed. Despite Marie McDonald's prominence in today's film industry, fans still enjoy Lamour's films, proving that her popularity has not diminished.

This year, Paramount Pictures is releasing two films starring her, which are specially introduced below: (1) "Road to Utopia": It's a huge farce, featuring not only Lamour but also Bing Crosby and Bob Hope. It's the same old team from "Road to Singapore," "Road to Zanzibar," and "Road to Morocco." Today, these three major stars are equally famous. Yet, they continue to collaborate, which is commendable, and this film is truly a rare masterpiece. Although it's being released this year, it was filmed two years ago. The entire film is filled with comical scenes and expressions, interspersed with the singing and dancing of the three stars. It is indeed a top-notch comedy.

(2) "Masquerade in Mexico": Lamour co-stars with Arturo de Córdova, who played the male lead in "Dixie Dugan." In this film, they perform novel dances, accompanied by exquisite South American music. It is directed by the renowned director Mitchell Leisen, whose masterpiece is "Frenchman's Creek."

### Recollections of Wu Yonggang Filming "The Road to National Construction"

— Guan Yu

The Second Factory of China Film Studio's "Loyal Family" will soon be seen by audiences in this city. This film is the first domestic production since our victorious return. I remember that in the autumn of 1944, the film's director, Wu Yonggang, led a large crew from Chongqing to Guizhou via Guiyang to film "The Road to National Construction." The cast included Hu Die, Wei Heling, Xie Tian, Ye Gao, Fang Bo, and over forty others. The film's content depicted the cooperation between the Han and Miao people in completing a railway that was of great military importance. Unexpectedly, just as this large crew reached its destination and began work, they encountered a military shift within a few days. The factory's people retreated from Hunan to Guangxi, along the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway all the way to Guiding, almost reaching Guiyang. The Guizhou provincial government also issued notices evacuating residents. By the end of November, most of the shops in Guiyang City were closed for business! The crew was in a desperate situation, unable to find cars, with bridges blown up and trains not running. So, they had no choice but to escape on foot! They walked all the way from Guangxi to Guiyang, losing all their clothes and luggage! They carried the "camera" back to Chongqing. Initially, everyone wanted to find transportation, and director Wu Yonggang volunteered to find connections and make arrangements. People were worried that Fang Bo, a very heavy man, wouldn't be able to walk, so they asked him to accompany Wu Yonggang and leave a day earlier. Who knew that the further they retreated, the less likely they were to find a car. Therefore, everyone decided to walk! They had no food to eat along the way and no place to sleep at night. They only slept under trees, using ropes to hang bedsheets on trees to block the dew. For several days, they encountered heavy rain, soaking the bedding. This was around November 20th of the lunar calendar, and the weather was cold. They were exhausted from walking during the day, and when they found a tree to sleep under at night, the wild wind blew, and the ground was cold. As a result, many people fell ill. The director contracted dysentery, plus malaria, and his feet were also blistered. He could only try to wrap his feet in cloth and continue walking, one step at a time, groaning in pain. Sometimes, they were so hungry that they couldn't even get a bowl of boiled water. In this way, they managed to drag themselves to Guiyang. The first thing they did was take a bath, rest for two days, take some medicine, and then find a car back to Chongqing. When he met me, his first words were, "I never thought I would see you again." At this time, his face was yellow and thin, and he didn't even have the strength to walk.

Now that we have won and returned to Shanghai, his first victory film is almost entirely completed. This time, filming "Loyal Family" and his previous experience filming "The Road to National Construction" in Guizhou-Guangxi are worlds apart. Therefore, I feel that the completion of this work is not an easy thing.

Those who have not personally experienced the hardships of filming "The Road to National Construction" cannot know what it tastes like!

### Hollywood Moguls Discuss This Year's Film Industry Trends

— Xin Fang

Darryl Zanuck (20th Century Fox): "The future of the film industry will inevitably move towards globalization. Hollywood is preparing to establish branches in both the Eastern and Western hemispheres to produce and promote various films that promote the American democratic spirit."

Hal Wallis (Paramount): "The most important task for this year's film industry is to discover new stars; because the average number of films that ordinary red stars make in a year is very limited; in other words, if you are just starting out and hoping to enter Hollywood, this year is the best opportunity."

Jack L. Warner (Warner Bros.): "During this war, many new weapons were discovered not only on the battlefield, but also a new era has entered the screen. Whether viewed from a scientific or artistic perspective, future developments are unpredictable."

N.J. Blumberg (Universal): "Just as some people now hope that the future world will be 'one family under heaven,' we in the film business also hope to take our work on the same path."

Harry Cohn (Columbia): "The film industry has indeed made a lot of progress in technology in the last ten years. However, in addition to technical issues, what is more important for today's films is that the themes and content of the films we make should capture the attention of audiences around the world."

### Stage and Literature

— Li Jianwu

Seventeenth-Century France

Seventeenth-century France was a remarkable era. Classical literature reached its zenith during this time. Just in the theater alone, Corneille, Racine, and Molière, whether tragedy or comedy, all became shining examples for later generations to emulate. Molière, in particular, is almost as famous in China as a Chinese playwright.

Their status in literary history is so high that almost every play became a masterpiece. However, this is from the perspective of literary value. If we discard the flowery language of the academy and take the actual stage performances of the time as the standard, it's a completely opposite situation. It's almost laughable that hardly any masterpiece was embraced by the audience. Some of Molière's masterpieces simply failed. Those famous works that we hear our teachers extolling in the classroom, just to give a few examples, were only performed four or five times before quietly disappearing.

Take Molière, for example. "The Miser" is so popular that it has been adapted several times in China. Cao Yu has a script called "Money Madness," and Yuan Zhongyi has a script called "Gold Obsession." But at the time, it completely collapsed. Meredith calls "The Misanthrope" the peak of high comedy, and there have always been translations of it in China. At the time, it also made Molière lose face. Two other masterpieces by Molière, "Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme" and "Les Femmes Savantes," suffered the same fate as "The Miser."

I'm not mentioning Racine here, the great tragic playwright revered by poets. His famous "Phèdre" has a Greek story, but the human nature is modern. Our "Thunderstorm" is such a story, a stepmother loving her stepson. I mean, his "Phèdre" also failed to win the audience's favor at the time. Several other masterpieces of his did not win him any honor. Corneille, the father of French tragedy, was not much better than his younger peers. He sometimes stumbled in their hands. It was truly tragic.

So who succeeded? Corneille had a brother who also occasionally wrote plays. Once, he took a story from a popular novel and adapted it into a tragedy, creating the highest record on the seventeenth-century stage. It was performed a full eighty times, equivalent to three or four hundred times today. Only when the actors were tired of performing did they voluntarily stop. The name was "Timocrate." That popularity can be compared to "Autumn Begonia," which was also adapted from a popular novel.

The highest record for comedy was also not taken by Molière. His masterpieces earned him the lowest record, never the highest. So who succeeded in this area? Again, it was a non-canonical figure named Boursault. He wrote a comedy with a very beautiful title, called "The Comedy Without a Title," which was performed a full sixty-two times and then replayed until it was exiled in the eighteenth century.

Of course, Molière also had a few successes, such as "The Imaginary Invalid," which was performed forty-two times. "The Flying Doctor" also reached forty times. But compared to those victors, his old brand was truly smashed.

After reading these facts, we must have a great feeling. Is there really a chasm between stage value and literary value? Is there really no connection between audiences and readers? Or does time accumulate, and is there no fixed standard for right and wrong? This is a fun question, and I don't want to be long-winded. Perhaps some people think I'm deliberately making excuses for cold plays.

### The Success of a Sculptor

— Zhang Chongren

The great French sculptor Rodin said, "The people who are active in moving around are by no means stupid." This is what he said when referring to the many sculptors who competed with him at the time. "If you want to compete with these people, you must at least waste as much time as they do." "However, if they could put more effort into the sculpture studio, they would definitely have more beautiful productions." Rodin participated in many competitions for great human statues, but he was almost always unsuccessful. His statue of the poet Victor Hugo and the writer Balzac, which are now immortal masterpieces of sculpture, were both kicked out by ignorant judges in the statue competitions. The statues that were selected and erected at the time were mostly mediocre and uninteresting, unrecorded in history books, unmentioned in the art world, standing on streets and roads, sometimes moved from important locations to secondary intersections, and after a while moved from secondary intersections to cold corners of walls and gardens, regrettable to destroy, useless to keep, becoming redundant on the city's appearance, and finally forgotten. However, Rodin's creations were first unused by people and placed in the depths of the studio, and were finally excavated by people for admiration for all ages, and there is a reason for this.

I admired the works of the great German sculptor Letterer in Berlin. Letterer was the most famous sculptor in contemporary Germany. The Chinese Embassy issued me a letter of introduction, and I was able to visit him. When the door opened, large and small plaster statues stood in groups. I asked where the master was, and one of the statues moved. It was Letterer wearing a pure white work uniform walking out of the statue group with a kind face and a casual attitude. He shook my hand and said, "Do Eastern artists also like my works?" We didn't say polite things and directly talked about various aspects of sculpture art. He put forward many of his views on sculpture art, which were very profound and unique. He put a lot of effort into the block and constant points. When I was in Berlin, I went to visit him every three or five days, always in his sculpture studio. He was kneading clay and talking to me at the same time. I was afraid of disturbing his work, so in my second meeting with him, I told him that I requested that he teach me when he was not working. He said, "I spend my whole time in the sculpture studio and rarely go out. It is most convenient for you to find me in the sculpture studio. I rarely leave traces in other places." I realized the factors that made Letterer so successful.

In 1931, I went from France to Belgium and entered the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, knowing that Lomba and Rosa were the two major sculptors in Belgium. Lomba was known for his masculinity, and Rosa for his softness, and their names shook all of Europe. The British government wanted to purchase modern sculptures from Belgium to enrich his art museum, so he purchased Lomba's marble statue "First Dynasty" and displayed it in the Teate Gallerie Art Museum in London, as the representative work of contemporary Belgian sculpture. The following year, I was able to study sculpture with Professor Lomba. He taught me things about the continuity of surfaces and lines, the starting and ending points of forces, the competition between concavity, convexity, light and shadow, the flexible use of the center of gravity, etc., that could not be heard from other artists or read in books. You can see it in his sculptures, but you need a considerable level of understanding. He was most impatient, and students who were slightly negligent in their practice would be scolded out of the door. When Belgian Emperor Albert died and the new Emperor Leopold ascended the throne, all the Belgian sculptors went to contact him, hoping to carve a statue of the new Emperor and Empress in the palace. Only Lomba buried himself in the sculpture studio and did not go. The new Emperor sent someone to invite Lomba, and Lomba agreed to make a statue for him, but he refused to work in the palace. He said, "The palace has too many rules and is too restrictive. Please have Your Majesty come to the sculpture studio." So the new Emperor brought his guards to Lomba's sculpture studio for an hour every day until the clay sculpture was completed. A writer who is buried in his work will not be buried.

One day, I mistakenly wore leather shoes and rushed into the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, climbing the stairs to practice clay sculpture. The students said: I was embarrassed and smiled. I didn't know why. A classmate came close to my ear and said, "You mistakenly wore leather shoes, and people are laughing at you." I looked down and blushed and couldn't lift my head. This was such an embarrassing thing. I am a Chinese, and my clothes are so disheveled in front of foreigners. The students kindly told me, "It's okay in itself, but in our European customs, no one wears mandarin duck shoes." I then declared, "We Chinese don't either. I was confused myself." The door rang and Professor Lomba came in, and everyone laughed. Lomba asked why they were laughing and I was even more embarrassed. I walked up to the teacher and explained: "I practice sculpture with Maria every night and come home late and tired. I take off my shoes at will, and this morning it was raining and dark, so I wore the wrong shoes. Don't blame the students for laughing. I am laughing at myself too." Lomba said: "This is nothing strange. I have forgotten to tie my tie and entered the art academy more than once. You can ask the students." So everyone laughed again. Lomba continued: "When you use all your brainpower on work, you often can't take care of those trivial things." The following year, in the sculpture competition, I was lucky enough to win the first prize and win the Belgian Emperor's Gold Medal. Lomba said to the contestants in a humorous tone: "Today you see, the one wearing mandarin duck shoes ran to the front." I said: "I was lucky to win the first prize, because I knew that three or four people's styles were better than mine, and I often asked them for advice. However, in this competition, they were probably a little nervous. Because I knew that I had no hope of winning the prize, I settled down to work, so I was lucky enough to win the first prize." Lomba smiled in his rich white beard and said: "Chinese people pay attention to politeness and humility, which is also the attitude that artists should have." The contestants gathered around and took my arms and asked me to treat him to coffee, and asked for a glass of beer each. Tomorrow morning, the model will change her posture, and we will plunge into the tense atmosphere of work again. Sculpture, a three-dimensional art, is viewed from all sides, occupies space, the rotation of lines, the constant competition of blocks, the sense of volume inside, the tactile sensation of the surface, posture, movement, meaning, implication, ... etc., many, many conditions, and practicing in a very limited time cannot solve them. Speaking of sculpture, bronze and marble are completely different techniques, so every great sculptor laments that the length of human life is too short to complete their ideals. Kneading clay for three to five years, doing nothing and being busy for a while, and spending most of the day on things other than making, will not achieve anything. The unanimous conclusion of the masters is that sculpture, an art, requires extremely mature skills for the difficulties of tools and materials, and genius alone is not enough. But to develop these skills, you need years of continuous practice, but this refers to sculptures with artistic value, otherwise it doesn't matter if you just knead a few shapes. Students of Western painting have all studied sculpture for one or two years, and children of five or six years old can make a round ball or even a dog when they hold mud.

### Memories of Rongcheng (Chengdu)

— Liu Dajie

I lived in Chengdu for more than two years, and what I loved most was the spring there. At that time, I wrote dozens of poems praising the spring in Chengdu, but they have all been lost. The Hundred Flower Pond, the Thatched Cottage Temple, Xue Tao Well, and the Wangjiang Tower – those beautiful places are unforgettable to this day. I often thought of writing something to preserve those scenes, but I am always caught up in a busy and impoverished life, hardly able to relax my mind for a moment. Today, I will write down a little of it, but it will only sketch out a small outline.

The weather in Chengdu is never too hot when it's hot, nor too cold when it's cold. There's plenty of moisture, and the weather is unpredictable, which is suitable for growing flowers and trees, but not for raising people. Therefore, people who live in Chengdu don't have good complexions, but the flowers and trees are all thriving. Fine plum blossoms, which are not easily seen in the areas around Beiping and Jiangnan, can be found in Chengdu. Magnolias measuring three or four zhang (about 10-13 meters), and oleanders two or three zhang high, which are not seen outside, can also be found in Chengdu. According to a botanical expert, there are more than 270 species of orchids in Chengdu. Orchids, which are treasured outside, are truly everywhere in Chengdu, as cheap as rapeseed flowers in the Jiangnan area. Before the war of resistance, a large bunch could be bought for three cents. Friends who come from outside invariably complain about the Chengdu weather, but no one dislikes the flowers and trees of Chengdu.

The city of Chengdu has a hint of the Beijing style. Planting flowers and bamboo, enjoying wine and tea, occupies an important part of life. Even a poor person's house has several flowers and trees in the courtyard, blooming with bright flowers throughout the year, adorning the lovely greenery. They all know how to cultivate them, and how to arrange them artfully. Red plum blossoms are set off by small bamboos, and orange trees are planted near roses. This kind of arrangement and support shows harmony and avoids monotony.

The spring in Chengdu probably starts more than a month earlier than in Beiping. From mid-February to mid-March is the time when plum blossoms are in full bloom. The color of plum blossoms is everywhere, in the streets and alleys, in the courtyards and between walls. Green plum blossoms are superior for their freshness, cinnabar plum blossoms for their vibrancy, and pink plum blossoms are not of high quality, but most of what you see in the Plum Garden of Wuxi and Deng Wei's place in Suzhou are this type of pink plum blossom. "Sparse shadows slant across the clear, shallow water, a faint fragrance floats in the dusk" – Lin Hejing's poem is truly well-written. I wonder if the many fine plum blossoms in Chengdu have ever seen it? Emerald green, snow white, pink, deep red – various colors are coordinated appropriately and naturally, truly worthy of the three characters "Sea of Fragrant Snow."

By the end of February and March, plum blossoms and orchids have already passed their prime. Replacing them is a lively scene of crabapples, magnolias, peaches, apricots, pears, plums, and winter jasmine, all kinds of flowers and trees competing for beauty. Willows have already trailed their soft, charming branches, swaying gently by the waters of the Hundred Flower Pond and Huanhua Stream. Large birds and small sparrows, with beautiful colors whose names I do not know, fly back and forth, singing songs. Xue Tao Well Park is also full of spring, with old poets strolling there, some playing the xiao (vertical flute) and singing songs, some fishing and playing the zheng (zither). That kind of sentiment is completely different from the scenery on West Lake.

The Flower Festival is the day the Chengdu flower market opens. The location is the Qingyang Taoist Temple outside the Twelve Bridges in the south gate. The flower market lasts for a month. This is a time of liberation for young men and women in Chengdu. The flower market is somewhat similar to the Bathing the Buddha Festival in Shanghai, but in Chengdu, it mainly focuses on selling flowers, supplemented by various amusements and local products from various places. Normally, we don't easily see women in gorgeous attire on the streets. At this time, the people of Chengdu come out in droves to sell flowers, sell flowers, look at people, and be looked at. Shoulder to shoulder, they are truly crowded beyond belief. Embroidered shoes, lace pants, peach-colored clothes, curly hair – colorful and bizarre, everything is there. It's less of a flower market and more of an exhibition of the people of Chengdu. It's as if the people of Chengdu, who have been cooped up for a year, want to take this opportunity to let loose. Those who are drunk are very drunk, those who are rowdy are very rowdy, and the happiest are the children, holding windmills and pinwheels, chewing candy in their mouths, singing and shouting. Thinking of the poet's line "No one returns without having seen the flowers," it is truly the most appropriate thing to say.

Going for a walk to the Hundred Flower Pond, the scene is also extremely beautiful. Across from it is the Thatched Cottage of Du Fu. A pair of ferries with canopies are always ready there. You wave your hand, and they will come to take you across. The water in the pond is so clear that it is strangely lovable. You can see the swimming fish in the shallow water very clearly. No matter when you go, there is always a group of people fishing there. Regardless of whether there are fish or not, they can patiently sit there, chatting and laughing, only returning to the city in groups at dusk. A dozen large willow trees on the embankment hang their newly green branches, the tips brushing the water's surface. When the breeze passes, they stir up beautiful ripples on the water.

When you have nothing to do, you can sit in a teahouse. Teahouses are truly everywhere in Chengdu. A bamboo chair, a makeshift wooden table – you can brew a bowl of tea and sit for an afternoon. There, you can see many things you don't usually see. Some sell calligraphy and paintings, some sell prints, some sell old clothes. Sometimes, you can buy some very good items for the least amount of money. Some teahouses in the suburbs are by the river, some are under flowers and trees. You can sit there, drink tea, eat peanuts, and leisurely appreciate nature, or read a book, or sleep – you will be very comfortable. If you get excited, you can also order one or two dishes and half a catty of wine, and get thoroughly drunk. Sitting in a rickshaw back to the city, all you feel is relaxation and leisure. You won't feel the kind of tense atmosphere that exists in outside cities at all. I often think that if a person lives in Chengdu for too long, they will become a lazy person, a lazy person who just gets by.

### Night

— Fei Cun

Night once again compels people to contemplate:

The eternal mystery within the black curtain.

"Quietude and sweetness,"

Say a pair of lovers on their pillows.

A child says timidly:

"You hide a green-eyed cat demon,

It transforms into an old woman sucking our brains;

And a long-tongued, red-haired hanged woman,

Leaps from an old tree in the wilderness

To the dreams of those who sleep alone."

A debauched libertine suffers,

Saying: Night is a glistening mirror,

Reflecting the maggots wriggling in his heart.

An old woman in an ancient house sobs:

"Ah, night, you are the most lingering

And touching epitaph,

Bringing the smile of the deceased to our pillows,

To exchange for our desperate and helpless tears."

### Pride and Sorrow

— Shi Jimei

Once, I heard a friend sigh with melancholy: "In the past, I had the pride of the solitary, now I only have the sorrow of the solitary." At first, I liked that he said it cleverly, but after further reflection, I knew that besides the words being used in a seemingly reasonable way, the meaning was foolish. In fact, what the solitary person is proud of is nothing but his sorrow, and his sorrow is caused by his pride.

Anyone with a healthy mind will not be proud or sorrowful, because life can never be lonely. In our surroundings – this vast sea of people – there are not a few faces that are not unfamiliar. We have many acquaintances; and even one or two close friends. Yes, that is enough to not be lonely. Can you still blame heaven and man by shouting about loneliness?

In the lonely garden, the pine's steadfastness, the bamboo's humility, and the plum's purity make them the Three Friends of Winter. Chrysanthemums are not incapable of withstanding the cold, but they are too self-admiring. In the garden of friendship, those who are proud and sorrowful are like chrysanthemums. Their loneliness is not caused by the environment, but by their own creation of this special habit. We certainly don't need "thousands of reds and purples," but excessive "self-admiration" is not a good thing.

Don't you believe me?

Tolstoy died, and Gorky recalled him: "When this man was alive, I was no longer an orphan living alone in the world." Clearly, with Tolstoy, Gorky was not lonely.

Zhuge Liang's Eulogy to Zhou Yu has "... If your spirit is conscious, use it to see my heart, from now on there will be no more kindred spirits in the world..." From this, we understand that although Zhou Yu had made things difficult for him several times, Zhuge Liang cried for his kindred spirit with sincere tears, because with Zhou Yu around, Zhuge Liang did not feel lonely. He hoped that kindred spirits would live forever, and would rather his enemies not die.

Such a great Gorky, such an extremely intelligent Zhuge Liang, and they had times when they were not lonely. Could it be that it is even more difficult for us to encounter one or two friends we like? Could it be that you have never shed tears because of a sincere letter or a few heartfelt words? Could it be that you have never been moved by some lovely things? Could it be that in your memory, there are really no shadows that you can cherish for life?

The heroes who travel the world know that "going out depends on friends." In the greenwood, the emphasis is on generosity and righteousness. In the dust of a foreign land, even if Han is not familiar, once they meet by chance, they will laugh loudly and shout, "All within the four seas are brothers." After a few words, they swear an oath over a handful of earth and become sworn brothers. What is more heartwarming than this in the world? If "love at first sight" is a predestined relationship from a previous life, then how could "feeling like old friends at first meeting" not be a good fortune from three lifetimes? I always yearn for the friendship of "why must we have known each other before we meet?"

Do you still want to say you are lonely? Then, dear, think about the old saying! "This world is a mirror, if you smile at it, it will smile back at you; if you cry, the mirror will also cry." I don't dare to scold you for being self-righteous, but I am thinking, imagine you are so aloof and incompatible that it is difficult for people to approach you. Actually, instead of spending too much time thinking about yourself, why not appreciate others a little? You will be happy, if you are willing.

Those lonely people, I call them "pitiful people who are proud and sorrowful." They have cleverly climbed up a high and unmanned dangerous building, looked around, but then inexplicably shouted: "Loneliness! This world has abandoned me." Who knows if it is the world that has abandoned him? Or has he abandoned this world?

Friendship has painted this world with pleasing colors. If there are no friends, then what is the use of these mountains, this blue sky, the magnificent sunset, poetry and painting, and elegant musical movements?

Life is friendship.

### Morning Glow

— Sudan

Look, how bright and beautiful it is! That faintly red morning glow.

Why are you ignoring me?

Ah! Why aren't you speaking? Are you afraid of startling the March seasonal wind?

What's wrong? You're crying! Child, don't be like this, why are you crying? Don't you know that crying is a disgrace? You should be strong, wipe away your tears! Are you cherishing the parting? Or are you afraid of the long road ahead?

You are still young! Be brave, brave the hardships, be a traveler in the world, taste some of the morning wind and night dew! Let me tell you, now, the green grass of Jiangnan has withered.

Why are you sighing so sadly again? Are you sighing that the dream of a distant sail is bleak? Don't be like this, don't shrink your feelings so heavily, smile lightly! Think more about happy things, parting is not so sad, and you will reunite soon!

Although I have a broken voice, let me sing a song of praise to welcome the spring for you, to send you off.

Are you still hesitating? You say, what are you attached to? Nothing? That's great! Raise your head, don't look timid, young people should stand tall and walk with big steps.

Let us shake hands tightly one more time, don't hesitate, take advantage of this dawn, when the morning glow is still brilliant, start your journey! I hope you will have a bountiful harvest.

Okay, go! Take care!

Distant traveler, ah! May your life always be the morning glow, brilliant.

### Flying Together (42)

— Zhao Qingge

(10)

Shi Yulou privately hired a qin player. Like the Four Great Dan actresses, he had his own tuning. If it wasn't a familiar qin player, it was difficult to cooperate with him. And the success of a performing actress, thirty percent depends on the help of the qin player. So, the relationship between a qin player and a performing actress is very important. Qin players rely on performing actresses for food, and performing actresses cannot perform without qin players. In general, performing actresses in ancient and modern times respect qin players. Moreover, often a performing actress's skills are taught by her qin player. Because a qin player can also sing many opera excerpts, otherwise, he would not be able to accompany the performing actress.

Shi Yulou's qin player only started working with her after she came to Beijing. This qin player's name is Zhang Xian, and he is very young, only twenty-four or five years old. He has a pair of triangular eyes, and always looks at people with a bit of deviousness. He has a hooked nose and a square mouth. Even without speaking, he makes you feel a little afraid of him. But although his appearance is not very presentable, he has talent. His qin skills are said to be no less skillful than the qin player of Mei Lanfang. He has also read some books and can write opera excerpts. Therefore, he is very self-important and also very proud. He not only accompanies Shi Yulou, but also often corrects Shi Yulou's errors in the wording of opera excerpts. So Shi Yulou gives him a large salary, almost taking up half of Shi Yulou's monthly earnings. Despite this, he is not satisfied. He often threatens Shi Yulou, saying: "Being a qin player doesn't make as much money as teaching opera. If I take in three or five apprentices, I can earn a hundred and eighty strings of cash a month." But now, he can only get a salary of forty strings of cash a month. Forty strings of cash is definitely not much for him, because his expenses are quite high: eating, drinking, whoring, gambling, he does it all. It is said that this is also a way to show off his talent.

Shi Yulou was panicking because of this threat. Coincidentally, Mrs. Mo was willing to let Lihua learn opera, and Second Mrs. Weng was also willing to let Liyun learn opera. This was truly an opportunity that fell from the sky! Shi Yulou's taking in apprentices is fake, he is only helping Zhang Xian drum up business, so that he can control Zhang Xian.

When Zhang Xian heard this news, his heart blossomed with joy! Now he can be said to have achieved two things at once. On one hand, he continues to work as a qin player, and on the other hand, he takes in apprentices. He is very grateful to Shi Yulou for his consideration. In order to repay Shi Yulou for this favor, he humbly conceded on the tuition very politely. He was only willing to charge twenty strings of cash a month for both Lihua and Liyun. But it was agreed that gifts must be sent on the three major holidays of the year as usual. Also, after they officially go on stage, he would be given twenty percent of their monthly earnings, which is called a pension, for a period of ten years. Shi Yulou discussed these conditions with Mrs. Mo and Second Mrs. Weng. Mrs. Mo did not understand the rules of this industry, so she could only let them say whatever they wanted and agreed to everything. And Second Mrs. Weng, although she understood, only complied with everything in order to please Shi Yulou. When Zhang Xian saw that this deal was done, he chose an auspicious day to hold the apprenticeship ceremony.

The ceremony was held in Shi Yulou's room. Mrs. Mo bought some gifts for Zhang Xian beforehand. Shi Yulou hosted the banquet on this day, and he explained that another purpose was to welcome Mrs. Mo.

Lihua and Liyun were like two small puppets, at the mercy of the adults. First, they kowtowed to the patriarch of the pear garden, and then they kowtowed to Zhang Xian. Temporarily, Zhang Xian also asked them to kowtow to Shi Yulou, because Shi Yulou's assistance was needed to teach skills, because it was more convenient for Shi Yulou to teach while he was performing.

The room was brightly lit, and filled with guests, like a scene from the New Year. After the ceremony was over, everyone praised Lihua for being beautiful. Everyone estimated that Lihua's appearance on stage would definitely be beautiful and she would definitely become popular. Because the point of being on stage is to be visually appealing. So it was decided at that time to make Lihua a Qingyi Huashan actress, and Chenyun a bearded actor. Firstly, it was imagined that Chenyun would look very suitable with a beard; secondly, they could also work together in the future. Hearing these words made Mrs. Mo's heart itch, as if her daughter was about to turn into a money tree. She never thought her luck in her old age would be reflected in her daughter! Zhang Xian was also very happy. He thought: As long as the apprentice has hope and can become popular, he doesn't have to worry about the price. Moreover, he really liked Lihua.

Lihua was very bewildered at this time. She didn't know that at this time she had become the financial pillar in the minds of two people! But she only felt that these people did not have good intentions towards her. Quietly leaving them, she returned to her room, (now, Mrs. Mo also lives in this apartment,) closed the door, and for some reason, a wave of sadness surged up and she couldn't help but lie on the bed and cry! She resented that Mrs. Mo had once promised her to come to Beijing to let her study, but now it was just a lie! So at this time, she deeply missed Mr. Mo, missed the education that Mr. Mo had given her in her childhood, and also missed Binling. She regretted not learning Binling, and insisted on staying at home! She remembered that Mr. Mo was often angry with Mrs. Mo for watching opera. She instinctively realized that "opera" was not a good thing, but she was forced by Mrs. Mo to learn opera! She was so sorry to Mr. Mo! She always believed that Mr. Mo was right, because Mr. Mo was knowledgeable. But Mr. Mo was gone, so she could only follow Mrs. Mo on the wrong path, or even on the bad path! Although she was unwilling, she had no choice but to obey Mrs. Mo, she was her mother! Therefore, Mrs. Mo had the right to dispose of her at will. Perhaps Mrs. Mo was well-intentioned, but this goodwill was wrong! She knew these things, but didn't know how to escape this terrible future? Her fragile little heart began to tremble!

Liyun happily knocked on the door and came in. Lihua simply didn't open it, no matter how loud Liyun shouted, she ignored her! Because she was a little angry at Liyun at this moment. She was angry that she was so happy! She was angry that she couldn't help or comfort herself at all!

### Beheading

— Shao Fu

Who is it that deprives us of rice?

Unlawful grain merchants, corrupt grain officials.

They manipulate, raise prices, hoard, speculate, making rice prices soar, making rice gradually scarce in the market, making us eat expensive rice, making us unable to afford high prices to buy rice, so that we have no rice to eat.

It is they who want the lives of millions of people in our city. Not "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth," for the sake of survival, most of us have reason to take the lives of a few of them.

It has now been found that there is a suspect in the unlawful use of grain loans, namely the manager of San Tai Rice Shop, Wu Rongsheng, and the manager of Wu Chang Rice Shop, Rong Yongming. If the evidence is conclusive and the above-mentioned circumstances are true, the citizens of our city have the right to demand that the authorities impose severe penalties to warn other illegal grain merchants and corrupt grain officials:

The method of beheading and public display may be too barbaric, but is the method of letting us starve to death considered civilized?

In times of chaos, use heavy penalties. This chaotic Shanghai is simply not like a world. After one or two heads fall to the ground, the air may be a little clearer.

### Sun Dianying and Pang Bingxun

— Willow Catkins

Forward

Sun Dianying and Pang Bingxun are probably not unfamiliar to many Chinese people, especially those in the Yellow River basin. Their "achievements" and "careers" have constantly and directly or indirectly brought disaster to our people, thus arousing our deep attention and concern. Mr. Sun's "Tomb Raiding of the Eastern Mausoleums" and "Struggle for Suiyuan," and Mr. Pang's participation in the Battle of Taierzhuang and capture in the Taihang Mountains, were all vivid and dramatic performances. Although the events have passed, their echoes still linger, making people wonder what kind of roles they really were. "Greenwood Heroes," "National Traitors," "Meritorious Officials," "Han Traitors," and "Underground Workers"—they seem to have played them all, and often played them so skillfully and aptly, like versatile actors who are proficient in all roles: male, female, painted-face, clown, and supporting. It is not easy to judge their identities clearly. Fortunately, the facts are all there. As long as we carefully consider them, they can serve as a reference for our conclusions.

Captured? Surrendered?

The Taihang campaign of the summer of the thirty-second year (1943), lasted from April to August, a full five months. The enemy launched four divisions and three brigades, making it a major campaign in terms of duration and strength.

Sun Dianying and Pang Bingxun were both captured in this campaign. While the dates and locations of their capture differed, the circumstances of their capture also varied greatly. First, Sun Dianying was captured in a small village in the Linqu County area. There was no fierce battle beforehand, only a few artillery shells as a prelude. The enemy then easily entered his headquarters, and he surrendered very docilely. According to records in the Taiyuan newspapers, more than three hundred of his staff and guards were captured at the same time. Each person had self-defense equipment of more than three guns—a rifle or light machine gun, a pistol, and two opium pipes. However, they did not waste a single bullet. They all very obediently watched as an enemy lieutenant and chairman approached Sun Dianying and gave him a very respectful salute.

Pang Bingxun was captured near Sanjiaokou, at the intersection of Lingchuan, Huguan, and Lin counties. He was hiding in a mountain cave, a very hidden location that was not easy to find. It is said that Sun Dianying sent his secretary as a guide to search for him. When captured, he had three followers and his son with him. He originally wanted to commit suicide with a pistol, but he probably lacked the courage. His son dissuaded him from doing so, which is a great pity. The distinction between "national traitor" and "meritorious official" rested entirely on that small pistol bullet.

The Fate of the Troops

Sun Dianying's New Fifth Army and Pang Bingxun's Fortieth Army both had extremely strong feudal habits. They centered their faith in the individual and had not entered the ideal state of nationalized armies. Therefore, after Sun Dianying was captured, the New Fifth Army, from privates to high-ranking commanders, all surrendered under the banner of "Harmony and Movement." One regiment after another, one division after another, they went to Xinxiang to register in a planned and orderly fashion.

The situation of the Fortieth Army was different. They had integrity and weight; they were unwilling to be Han traitors and slaves. After Pang Bingxun was captured, the troops, under the command of Deputy Commander Ma Fawu, gradually approached the Twenty-seventh Army in Lingchuan and Huguan and continued to fight fiercely until they received instructions from the central government. Then they crossed south to Luoyang to regroup and train. Not a single officer or soldier made a spontaneous and base surrender. From this point of view, the Fortieth Army was superior to the New Fifth Army, and Pang Bingxun was superior to Sun Dianying. The facts have already told us in great detail, without the need for any superfluous confessions or defenses from them.

Lone-Wolf Drug Dealers

Sun Dianying also did something that wronged the country and the nation. His cadres were all famous drug dealers who used their military status as a cover for drug trafficking, which truly humiliated the country and the nation. We often saw one or two officers and soldiers from the New Fifth Army frequently running between Luoyang and Linqu, always carrying high-quality black goods in their waists. Occasionally, there would be batches of livestock carrying large quantities of opium, red pills, and white powder, openly transported from the Taihang Mountains to Luoyang to absorb legal tender. It seemed that a tacit understanding had been established with the Luoyang command and the river defense troops, and no one ever asked about the trouble from beginning to end!

Why Hide in a Cave?

Pang Bingxun was the commander-in-chief of the Twenty-fourth Army Group, commander of the Fortieth Army, chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, and the highest military commander of the Taihang Mountain Military Region. As such a leading figure, why did he abandon control of the troops and hide alone in a mountain cave when the situation became tense? This enigma has not been factually answered to this day.

It is said that Pang Bingxun was a cripple who limped when he walked and was overweight. Whether marching or fighting, he often needed four people to carry him, otherwise, he could not move an inch. We should know that the Taihang Mountains are not like Shanghai or Nanjing, with smooth and flat asphalt roads. Instead, they are full of narrow mountain paths and steep cliffs. Besides walking, there is no way to accommodate other means of transportation. So he had no choice but to hide in a cave, trying to escape this great disaster.

This explanation may be far-fetched, but there is no other way to explain it. Unless there are other reasons, we cannot make speculative guesses before we obtain the facts. Only God knows the truth.

Not Violating Conscience

In this battle, there were no precise statistics on the number of officers and soldiers captured. We can only use "many" to represent this question. Sun Dianying and Pang Bingxun set up reception centers in Xinxiang, specializing in accommodating the scattered officers and soldiers of the Twenty-fourth Army Group and receiving prisoners led over by the enemy. They were not entirely devoid of conscience. As long as you were unwilling to join the enemy, they would generously help you cross to the south. Even if large units broke through and returned, they could provide convenience as long as the facts allowed. The Eighth Column and part of the Forty-fifth Division, with more than a thousand soldiers, broke out of the enemy's multiple encirclements in a roundabout way. Sun Dianying and Pang Bingxun did provide some minor assistance on the side.

### Aristocratic Cafe - Ten Thousand Dollars Per Cup of Coffee

— Feng Rao

Amidst the economic downturn, cafes continue to stand tall without any sign of decline. It is said that there are currently seventy or eighty cafes in Shanghai. Several more are said to be opening soon, including an "absolutely aristocratic" cafe on Chengdu Road. It is said that the price of each cup of coffee is set at ten thousand dollars. It was originally intended to be named "Aristocratic Cafe," but because the word "aristocratic" was too provocative, there is talk of changing the name to "Sino-American." According to people in the industry, "Shanghainese people like to eat and drink; an expensive price can attract attention." This can be said to reveal the vanity of Shanghainese people in one sentence.

It is also learned that the background of "Sino-American" is the "Four Sisters," and the decoration costs alone amount to one hundred million dollars. How can the public not be ashamed of these young ladies' boldness! The saying "Comparing people makes you mad" is indeed a wise saying.

The city's brothel registration has been approved for more than six hundred, but only two hundred prostitutes have passed the examination. In this proportion, will prostitutes inevitably have to work in several brothels in the future? It is unknown how the authorities will deal with those who are "unqualified."

It has recently been learned that in Hankou Concession, there are many all-night dance halls, and the scenery is no less than that of Shanghai. Recently, the authorities have formulated measures stipulating that female dancers must be at least eighteen years old to operate, and those who are seventeen years old will be ordered to change careers. It is expected that Hankou dance hall girls will "forever be eighteen years old" without a doubt. But the most puzzling thing is, what is the "big difference" between eighteen and seventeen years old?

### Wang Yunwu Used to Pull Rickshaws

— Yu Qian

Wang Yunwu is now the Minister of Economic Affairs.

This gentleman is large in stature and loud in voice. Every time he attends a meeting of the Political Council, his words often shock the audience, much like a painted-face singer in Peking opera. Some people regard him and Wang Xiaozai as the standard loud voices of the two Wangs in the Political Council.

He has done a good job in presiding over the Commercial Press. In Chongqing, he lived in the branch of the Commercial Press on Baixiang Street in the lower half of the city. He used an umbrella and walked to and from the city, like a comrade of Wu Zhihui.

Someone once talked to him about the secret to success in life and work. He had an analogy, he said: "I seem to be pulling a rickshaw in Chongqing. When walking uphill, I try my best to pull upward with all my strength; when walking downhill, I try to be slow, hold the handlebars steady, step by step, without panic."

Everyone may wish to think carefully about this principle.

### Church Satire

— Li

There is a church in Shanghai, and its location is ironic. You say: Which church is this? Where is it located? (Answer in tomorrow's edition)

### Don't Be Perfunctory

— Xu Yulin

There is a Chinese saying: "A day-laboring monk strikes the day's bell." This sentence describes people who live a perfunctory life. Currently, most of the large companies, manufacturers, and even municipal agencies in this city are presenting a perfunctory situation. People are perfunctory in human relations, and they are also perfunctory in official affairs. Because everyone is perfunctory to each other, everyone holds an attitude of just getting by. The impact directly reduces administrative efficiency or stagnates the business of manufacturers, and indirectly causes national weakness and social depression. Whether it is a public institution or a commercial factory, if the staff all hold a perfunctory mentality, it is equivalent to everyone not cooperating. I would like to ask, if a factory, if the factory director and employees are all perfunctory to each other, can they still achieve the ideal of reducing costs and improving products? Similarly, a local agency, if everyone likes to be perfunctory and is unwilling to cooperate sincerely with one heart and one mind, don't even think about promoting local administrative efficiency.

So I think that now to solve the country's problems and eliminate local insecurity, one thing is very important, that is, we should eliminate the perfunctory atmosphere in society, so that administrative efficiency can be improved, and industry and commerce can achieve practical development. This will enable our motherland to keep pace with the major powers.

### Comic Strip - Sanmao Joins the Army (Twenty-One)

— Drawn by Zhang Leping

### Red Tassel Hat

— De Ping

The police have changed into grass-green summer uniforms.

I remember the "Shanghai Yi Field Scenery" of the twentieth year of Guangxu (1894) said:

"The police set up by the Municipal Council are half Westerners and half Chinese. The Chinese are guaranteed by those with occupations, and their clothes have Chinese and Western numbers. There are Chinese and Western numbers in the left and right circles, so that people can easily identify them. They are divided into sections to patrol the streets, and they hang dark lights around their waists at night. Western police officers carry knives, and Chinese police officers hold batons, patrolling all night long."

The re-edition of "Shanghai Tourist Guide" in the twelfth year of the Republic of China (1923) has the following records:

"In the past, Shanghai Chinese police officers wore ordinary people's clothes and melon-skin hats, but there were two white lines embroidered in circles on the front of their short clothes, which were the Chinese and Western characters of the serial number."

"Later, they changed to wearing red tassel hats with the front cut, and cool hats in summer. There were shiny copper buttons on the chest, a lacquered leather belt around the waist, white socks in summer and black boots in winter, which seemed majestic. Until recently, they wore leather boots and military hats, and there was no distinction, and the situation was the same as that of soldiers. The hats worn by today's Chinese police officers are the same as those worn by Western police officers in the past. Thirty years ago, Western police officers changed to wearing copper hat styles, which have not been changed to this day."

Now, when I think back to a red tassel hat swaying on the streets of Nanjing Road, what a scene it was.

### Flesh Transplantation

— Gang Ren

All diseases are the great enemies of mankind. They destroy people's bodies, eliminate people's lives, and there are many incurable diseases. But human scientists and medical scientists are not afraid, and with their fearless spirit, they are committed to overcoming diseases and rescuing humanity, step by step.

The International Medical Union—the American Rockefeller Foundation—in its most recent report, in addition to reporting on the past year's research on overcoming various diseases such as typhus, malaria, yellow fever, and tuberculosis, also suggested organizing an international medical union to jointly study various airborne infectious diseases, promoting the work of prevention and elimination; on the one hand, using the convenience and speed of air transport to replace the old-fashioned passive methods of abandoned seaport quarantine.

Gospel for the Blind—The New York Hospital in the United States recently united with its nearby nineteen hospitals to organize the establishment of an "Eye Bank." It stores live cornea—the transparent body that covers the eye; it is stored in a closed container with hot and cold equipment, and the container is filled with special medicines. It is prepared for those who have been blinded by fire, viruses, and other damaged corneas, as a means of regaining sight, because those people's other parts, such as the nervous retina, are all complete. Although the work of "eye transplantation" was discovered long ago, its formal and large-scale application is still for the first time.

When the deceased has given his life or the legal person has given permission, the cornea of the deceased can be removed and maintained within four hours; babies who are born and die are also "donors"; and people with incurable blindness can also contribute their perfect cornea. Now, with this method, one out of five blind people can regain their sight.

New Uses for Milk—Milk will be an important and valuable raw material in the chemical industry of the future; American scientists have extracted many kinds of products from it: such as anesthetics, pigments, rubber, and flexible glass. Various extremely useful drugs can be extracted from milk whey, such as the famous "penicillin," a bactericidal anesthetic, and a kind of lactic acid, which is used to make the blood after severe trauma or surgery, and other special military drugs, which, if used in peacetime, will equally increase human happiness.

New "Meat" Transplantation—The American Red Cross has made people's "blood transfusions" into plasma for wartime rescue services, and recently there have been improvements, that is, making plasma containing fibrinogen, etc.; the new meat skin transplanted for the wounded, when used for surgery, first soak the plasma liquid, the components automatically promote the adhesion of fibrin, which not only stops bleeding at the same time, but also makes places that surgeons cannot suture, such as between fingers and toes, adhere successfully.

New Drug for Treating Tuberculosis—People have taken another step forward in the work of overcoming tuberculosis. Drs. Miller and Lake discovered another penicillin-related product, chlortetracycline. Although it has not yet been tested on humans, human tuberculosis germs, transplanted into guinea pigs, are 100% fatal, but after injection for several days, although the drug, like penicillin, can only inhibit reproduction and indirectly kill; it has been found that the bacteria has failed. The two doctors are further studying what elements have such effects.

Use of "Tantalum" in Manufacturing—Tantalum has been found to be the most ideal metal for surgical instruments that has been sought for a long time. Because it is strong, flexible, stainless, non-toxic, and harmless, it can be made into various forms, and has no "electrolytic effect" when encountering blood; and it can be used to repair human defects. Tantalum sheets, wires, and foils can be used to repair damaged parts of the bones of the brain and nose; tantalum has an important position in surgical medicine.

Councilor Lu Qian once wrote a couplet for the air-raid shelter, which can be described as made by heaven and earth. It reads:

### Before and After Victory

"After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, everyone had a misconception that life would be better and they could enjoy themselves after the victory, even myself. But now I know it was wrong."

Mr. Pan Xulun is naive and will admit his mistakes himself.

I know that some friends couldn't even afford to ride a rickshaw in Chongqing before the victory, but now they are even preparing to use ten or eight gold bars to buy a car.

Who is willing to endure hardship again?

### Heaven is High, the Emperor is Far Away, There are Few People, but Many Livestock

Chairman Chiang personally stated that those who manipulate and hoard grain will be shot to death upon verification. Indeed, if we want to "not" let the rice weevils act strangely again, the most effective way is to chop off the heads of a few unscrupulous merchants. When the character for rice is chopped off, it becomes the character for "not," and perhaps it will be possible to "not" act strangely again.

Mayor Wu repeatedly said at the Tsinghua alumni welcome party and the press conference that workers should know that if they want to eat chicken eggs, they must not kill the hen first. Now the hens that are seen have not been killed, and they will also die themselves. It is very likely that in the near future, Shanghai will suffer from chicken plague. We certainly hope that those who want to eat chicken eggs will not kill the hen, and at the same time, we also hope that the owner has proper methods for raising chickens.

The Ministry of Finance stipulates that banks are not allowed to make gold collateral loans. A number of gold collateral loans were discovered by the Chongqing Bank due to a theft case. Is this what is called accidental?

The "pigsty" is the one who is enthusiastic about starting work! This is a fact. According to the report, "The pig workers at the No. 1 Slaughterhouse on Shajing Road and the No. 2 Slaughterhouse on Nanyang Bridge clashed due to opposition to the exploitations and reneging of the pig party." In this way, the pigs in the slaughterhouse, although they will eventually be cut down, can at least prolong their lives for some time.

"Heaven is high and the emperor is far away, there are few people but many livestock;" the situation in general corrupt institutions can be understood from these two sentences.

Tang Yiming, a giant businessman from Chongqing, initiated the idea of ​​reconstructing the Chongqing Xiaochangkou Square into a garden and building a seven-story garden building. Therefore, I connected to how the Chongqing Great Tunnel should be utilized. In this hot summer (Chongqing has been very hot recently), if you store a boat of Rongyu in the cave, it would be a summer resort, comparable to the Sang Geng books of Qiuyuan.

The Beijing News reported that "Officials are conducting a door-to-door investigation of vacant houses. If the homeowner is still detained and does not rent them out, the municipal government will rent them out on its behalf. Those who own houses and wait for a good price to sell are all panicked and are scrambling to find suitable tenants." This is exactly what the proverb says, "The meat in the walnut will not come out without knocking." There are not fewer walnuts in Shanghai than in Nanjing; the peach shell is not afraid of being hard, only afraid of no one picking up a stick to knock.

At a banquet, I heard the female worker representatives of a certain factory sing several popular famous songs in public, and they unanimously praised the high level of the female workers. In fact, ten or twelve years ago, female workers could also sing a few songs, only the tunes of the songs were different in the past and present. Is it the progress of the songs? Or the progress of the female workers?
