[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] The Government Organization Group, the first group committee of the Political Consultative Conference, held its first meeting at 3:00 PM today to discuss the opinions raised by various members. It is scheduled to hold a second meeting tomorrow to continue the discussion.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] The agenda for the sixth meeting of the Political Consultative Conference on the 16th will be to discuss military issues, and Vice Minister Lin of the Ministry of Military Affairs will be invited to report on the military reorganization situation. The proposals include: a proposal by member Zeng Qi and four others on "Ceasing Military Conflicts and Implementing Nationalization of the Armed Forces," and a proposal by member Zhang Laisheng and eight others on "Implementing Nationalization of the Armed Forces and Conducting Large-Scale Troop Reductions."

(United Press, Chongqing, 15th) The Political Consultative Conference has today accepted the draft government reorganization plan, which will still grant the Kuomintang the leading position and entrust Chairman Chiang as the chairman. His powers, under the system of checks and balances, will be somewhere between those of the American President and the British King. This plan has only been accepted in principle; the technical details will be agreed upon later. The Kuomintang will still retain the power to appoint the transitional government, but all parties and factions will have the power to decide policies in the reorganized National Government Committee. The National Government Committee will replace the Supreme National Defense Council and become the highest legislative body of the country, supervising all ministers within the government in terms of budget allocation. The ministers will not be responsible to the National Government Committee except for the budget constraints. The Political Consultative Conference debated heavily this morning on expanding the government to accommodate various parties and the distribution of seats on the National Government Committee.

[United Press, Chongqing, 15th] The Political Consultative Conference has formally received Chairman Chiang's plan to accommodate various parties and expand the government. However, no decision has yet been made on the Chinese Communist Party's request to release Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng.

[Report from Our Newspaper] A broadcast from San Francisco on the 15th stated: The Chongqing Political Consultative Conference held its fifth meeting this afternoon. The Chinese Communist Party representatives presented eleven proposals to guarantee the freedom of the people and explained them in detail one by one, which took a considerable amount of time.

### No Proposals for Government Program; Members Only Exchange Broad Opinions; To Be Summarized and Discussed by Committee Before Being Presented to the Assembly

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] The Political Consultative Conference held its fifth meeting at 9:00 AM today (the 15th) to discuss the issue of the government program. Representatives from various parties and non-party representatives did not submit any formal proposals but only exchanged opinions broadly. Speakers today included Liang Shuming, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Shenfu, Wu Tiecheng, Dong Biwu, Zhang Bojun, Chang Naide, Luo Longji, Chen Bulei, Li Zhuchen, and Shao Congen. It was decided that the group committee would summarize opinions from all sides and then present them to the assembly for discussion. Secretary-General Lei Zhen reported that 32 members were present, and members Wang Shijie and Deng Yingchao were excused. Interim Chairman Sun Ke immediately announced the continuation of the discussion on the unfinished issue of government organization and the agenda item for today, the government program, inviting members to express their opinions. Liang Shuming spoke first, reiterating the issue of local government power, to be placed in the (Government Reorganization Plan). At that time, the agenda discussion shifted to the government program issue. Huang Yanpei hoped that the government would first propose a draft government program based on the Outline for Resisting Japan and National Reconstruction to facilitate discussion. Zhang Shenfu said that the Democratic League's draft had not yet been prepared and that the main task of the Political Consultative Conference was to produce a common program. As for the content and form of the program: (1) there should not be too many clauses, (2) it should not be entirely principled but somewhat concrete. The content should include politics, economics, military affairs, diplomacy, education, academics, culture, society, relief, and post-war rehabilitation. Regarding the creation of the program, Zhang believed that it could be proposed by the government or produced through negotiation.

Wu Tiecheng spoke, saying that it was very difficult to discuss the government program today because no party had submitted a plan. He wanted to present opinions on the methods and principles of the government program: (1) Without dividing into categories, during this transitional period, anything that should be implemented and can be implemented can be listed as inclusive clauses. (2) Following the format of the Outline for Resisting Japan and National Reconstruction, it should be divided into departments such as politics, military affairs, diplomacy, education, and economics, with each department defining several principles. (3) He participated in a symposium yesterday, and some people outside the meeting said that the Political Consultative Conference was not convened according to law and that its members were not elected, so its nature was no different from a party meeting, even criticizing them as a "distribution conference." Since the majority of those participating in the Political Consultative Conference are party members, it would be better to directly change the common program to a (Political Agreement), such as the kind of agreement made by various political parties in the wartime coalition cabinet in Britain. This was the opinion of people outside the meeting, which he reported for reference. As for the content of the program, it should abide by the National Father's Outline of National Reconstruction, and the Outline for Resisting Japan and National Reconstruction, the political program and policies passed by the Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang, and the 35th-year administrative policy passed by the National Political Council can all be used as a basis for discussion. Since no party has submitted a proposal, it is best to have a broad exchange of views first and then submit it to a subcommittee for study and discussion before presenting it to the assembly.

Dong Biwu presented the Chinese Communist Party's main points for the government program: (1) the basic policy of peaceful national reconstruction, (2) the people's freedom and rights, (3) expanding the foundation of the National Government, (4) preparing for the convening of a National Assembly, (5) local autonomy, (6) military reform, (7) post-war rehabilitation, (8) reform of finance and economy, (9) reform of culture and education, (10) international peace and security. Dong also explained each of these points in detail.

The meeting then recessed for five minutes before continuing to discuss the name of the program. Zhang Bojun, Chang Naide, and Huang Yanpei advocated calling it the Peaceful National Reconstruction Program. Zhang also explained that the purpose of formulating the program was to solve current problems and lay the foundation for future constitutional governance, to accomplish the mission of inheriting the past and paving the way for the future. Chang Naide, representing the Youth Party, presented his opinions on the government program, the principles of which were (1) brevity is better than extravagance, (2) reality is more important than theory, (3) removing evils is more important than promoting benefits. The key points of the content should focus on (1) national unity and stability, (2) China's responsibility to the world, (3) the coordination and application of the entire system, (4) the basic guarantee of democracy and freedom, (5) the economic capacity and support of the people, (6) the full development of education and culture. As for the drafting and discussion methods of the program, the Outline for Resisting Japan and National Reconstruction should be used as a blueprint, and five people should be appointed to draft it and present it to the assembly. The content should separately define the protection of people's rights, the reform of central politics, the issue of local autonomy, post-war relief, the reorganization of finance and banking, and the support of production industries. Chang also said that the preamble to the program should state the significance of the nation first, the nation first, implementing democratic politics, maintaining world peace, paving the way for constitutional governance, and solving the current urgent problems. Luo Longji said that the creation of the government program is based on the needs of the people. Luo also commented on the programs proposed by the Chinese Communist Party and the Youth Party. Chen Bulei emphasized that a calm and harmonious spirit should be maintained during the meeting, and unnecessary terms commonly used outside the meeting, such as "coalition government," should not be used, and it is best to avoid them altogether. Because the so-called (coalition government) only exists in democratic countries in times of war, it is not applicable to the current organization of China. Regarding the name of the Peaceful National Reconstruction Program, now that military conflicts have ceased, the word "peaceful" has lost its object, so it can be simply called the National Reconstruction Program. Furthermore, regarding the drafting of the program by a subcommittee and the presentation of the draft to the assembly, more time should be given, because the opinions put forward by various parties involve the issue of local government organization, which is more complicated and should be fully negotiated so as not to hinder national unity. As for the military aspect, it should be decided whether and how to include it in the program after the military subcommittee has reached a resolution. Finally, he hoped that all parties would submit a written version of their oral statements to the secretariat so that the subcommittee would have a basis for negotiation. Zhang Shenfu said that this meeting should not only produce a program and ensure its implementation, but it must also be supervised by the people. Li Zhuchen elaborated in detail on solving the difficulties of farmers, developing water conservancy, revitalizing agriculture, strengthening industrial production, and promoting industrial construction. Fu Sinian wanted to speak, but because it was past noon, he stated that he would leave it for the next meeting. Huang Yanpei mentioned again the content of the program, believing that attention should be paid to local politics, labor-capital disputes, and the Provisional Constitution during the period of political tutelage. He also said that this meeting is to jointly plan national affairs, and words such as "distribution" used by outside critics should not be brought up in the meeting in the future. The chairman announced that the opinions of the members would be studied and negotiated by the group after being recorded, and then submitted to the assembly for discussion. Secretary-General Lei read out the list of members of the group committee and scheduled the sixth meeting for 9:00 AM tomorrow, and the meeting adjourned at one o'clock.

### Harmonious Atmosphere at the Fifth Meeting; Discussions Focus on Guaranteeing Freedom

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 15th] At the fifth meeting, the government program was discussed, and no party put forward a concrete plan. The chairman asked the members to put forward their opinions, and all sides unanimously agreed that creating a program was necessary. Regarding the name of the program, Zhang Shenfu first proposed "Common Governance." Dong Biwu explained that the Chinese Communist Party had already drafted a Peaceful National Reconstruction Program. Chen Bulei said that since the War of Resistance had ended, the word "peaceful" had no object and advocated using the National Reconstruction Program. Regarding the nature of the program, it was recognized that it should be a common code for the transitional period before the implementation of constitutional government. Zhang Shenfu believes that it was not elected by the people and doubted whether the agreed program was legal. Wu Tiecheng explained that the outside opinion believed that it was a political consultation of various parties. Luo Longji greatly supported the Magna Carta of England, proving that even an agreement of various parties could be legal. The members spoke a lot on the principles and content. Chang Naide's three principles of brevity, reality, and the elimination of abuses were highly praised. The content put forward by various parties was very broad, including politics, finance, economy, military affairs, diplomacy, post-war relief, culture, and education, all of which focused on guaranteeing the freedom of the people. As for the program proposal, Huang Yanpei repeatedly advocated that the government should put it forward first. Wu Tiecheng proposed that the Outline of National Reconstruction, the Political Program of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, the National Administrative Policy of the National Political Council for the 35th year, and the Outline for Resisting Japan and National Reconstruction could be used as the basis for the drafting of the proposal. Zhang Bojun proposed that the laws of the National Government and the political programs of various parties should be added as reference points. Zhang Shenfu proposed that the program should have a preface. Chang Naide advocated that the preamble should include (1) the nation first, the nation first, (2) the politics of the whole people, (3) guaranteeing world peace, (4) preparing for the implementation of constitutional government, (5) urgent measures at the moment, and other meanings. As for the military method, it is still to be negotiated.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 15th] (1) There were frequent grand speeches at the meeting, and the atmosphere was very harmonious and lively. (2) Zhang Shenfu spoke, declaring that the Democratic League was not a political party, and hoped that the members of the League would speak, and if they were right, they would belong to the League, and if they were wrong, they would be responsible for themselves. (3) When Dong Biwu reported on the content proposed by the Communist Party, he said that the freedom of the people should include the right to strike and demonstrate. A male reporter from a major newspaper asked a female reporter from a small newspaper if there was freedom to strike. (4) Industrialist Li Zhuchen cried out that if labor disputes in factories are not resolved, please withdraw the party's activities from the factories. (5) Li Zhuchen proposed, the national farmers and workers, talked eloquently, hoping that the government would use great efforts, do great things, and seek great benefits, and not compete with the people for small profits. (6) When all parties talked about improving the lives of farmers, they all mentioned the 25% rent reduction, but Luo Longji, who was eloquent and good at words, mistakenly said that it was a 25% rent increase. (7) The chairman announced a 15-minute break, and many members went out to use the toilet. Wang Yunwu said, we are here waiting for the public bus. (8) When Luo Longji heard someone quoting outside criticism, there were many dirty words in it, and he asked everyone not to use harsh words such as distribution of spoils. Chen Bulei said, the word harsh is also harsh. (9) When Dong Biwu proposed the political program today, he admitted that he was an amateur in industrial construction. (10) The chairman asked Fu Sinian to speak, and he saw that the clock was 12:30, because he was humble that the day was long, and he would not speak today. However, because he was going to participate in the subcommittee, he wanted to speak again. Zhang Laisheng picked up his briefcase and shouted, is there not enough time? Why bother! (11) Zhou Enlai did not speak today, only when Cao Biwu reported, he left his seat to spit phlegm once.

### Military Mediation Department Acts Quickly; Sends a Three-Person Team to Jehol; To Convey the Order to Stop the Conflict in the Chifeng Area

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] The Military Mediation Executive Department recently issued its first communiqué stating that the newly established Military Mediation Executive Department took swift action today to stop the conflict in the Chifeng area of ​​Jehol Province. This morning, a three-person peace team was dispatched to the area with a ceasefire order. The three committee members arrived here in just over a day and a half. The order to stop the conflict was issued in Chongqing just six days ago, and the Executive Department has already begun to act, fulfilling its mission to stop the conflict between the National Government and the Communist Party. The troops on both sides in the Chifeng area may not have received the ceasefire order due to broken communications. This morning, a U.S. Marine Corps fighter jet dropped leaflets in the area, urging both sides to stop the conflict, and the leaflets requested the Communist-led forces in Chifeng to prepare the local airport for the landing of the peace team's C-47 aircraft. The members of the team are Major Gu Hanli, representing the National Government, ××× representing the Communist Party, and Colonel Dutille, representing the U.S. military. The team carries the ceasefire order issued by Wang Bingnan in Chongqing. They will first fly to Jinzhou to obtain direct orders from General Du Zhangming's headquarters, as the National Government troops in Jehol are under the command of General Du. They also carry letters signed by the three committee members requesting protection and assistance. After presenting their instructions, the team will investigate the situation in the conflict area and report to the Executive Department headquarters.

[United Press, Yan'an, 14th] Thirteen representatives of the Chinese Communist Party to the Military Mediation Executive Department, led by Li Kenong, Director of the Chinese Communist Party's Office in Chongqing, flew to Beiping this morning on a C47 U.S. transport plane to assist Ye Jianying in implementing the order to stop military conflicts and restore transportation. Li Kenong will serve as the Secretary of the Military Mediation Executive Department in Beiping.

### Communist Troops Violate Ceasefire Order, Continuing Attacks in Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Shanxi Provinces

[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou by Our Newspaper, 15th] Communist troops are still active in Lincheng on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway. General observation suggests that the actual ceasefire process will begin in North China and end in northern Jiangsu. Since the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters is located far away in Beiping and is still in the process of being organized, it is unrealistic to expect the Communist troops along the Pinghan and Jinpu Railways, as well as in the mountainous regions of northeastern Anhui and southwestern Henan, and even in the marshlands of northern Jiangsu, to keep their word and immediately cease their political activities. Even if the ceasefire order from Yan'an has indeed been issued, it is doubtful whether there is only one version of the order from Yan'an. Fair-minded individuals in the capital today generally believe that the ceasefire order issued by the Communist troops has been dazzling, but there is no need to be pessimistic. After the government recently announced that Communist troops were continuing military actions in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, northern Shanxi, and northern Jiangsu, the Xinhua Daily did not refute it, and Zhou Enlai did not loudly protest, probably excusing it by saying that the order had not yet reached remote areas and that it was okay to gain a small advantage. It is a pity that the Communist troops are not seizing this precious opportunity to win the hearts of the people and quickly cease hostilities. If the work of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters cannot be quickly advanced from north to south, reaching Anhui and Jiangsu, it will be difficult for the refugees north and south of the Yangtze River to avoid suffering more hardships. The minimum request is that Robinson, Zheng Jiemin, and Ye Jianying should take the Jinpu Railway to Nanjing in the shortest possible time.

[Dispatch from Chongqing by the Central News Agency, 15th] A spokesman for the Military Commission stated on the 15th that, according to the Xinhua Daily of the 14th, "On the third day after the ceasefire order was issued, the 94th Army invaded Fengrun." On the 15th, the newspaper continued to publish news that after the ceasefire deadline had expired, the Nationalist army in southern Henan attacked Guangshan, and the CCP representative office issued a telegram on the 14th stating that the National army in Hebei and other places had not stopped attacking. All of this disregarded the final deadline for the cessation of conflict (12:00 noon on the 13th of this month) and the true state of affairs, which is regrettable. After the committee telegraphed the agreed-upon measures for both sides to cease conflict and restore transportation on the evening of the 10th to all units for strict compliance, it successively received telegrams of reply from He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Army Headquarters, directors of various headquarters, directors of various pacification headquarters, commanders of various war zones, commanders of army corps, commanders-in-chief of various garrison commands, commanders-in-chief of guards, chairmen of various provincial governments, commanders-in-chief of various group armies, and army commanders, stating that all parts of the country had complied with the deadline. According to reports from various unit commanders, the Communist army continued to launch large-scale attacks in northern Jiangsu, Shandong, Shanxi, Northeast China, and southern Henan after the final deadline for the cessation of conflict (12:00 noon on the 13th of this month) had passed on the 14th. The commanders of these units have telegraphed requesting that the responsible persons of the CCP be notified to quickly and effectively stop the attacks. To clarify the situation for everyone, the Communist forces' attacks in various places after the expiration of the specified deadline for the cessation of conflict are recorded as follows:

(A) The situation of Communist army attacks within the specified deadline for the cessation of conflict (until 12:00 noon on the 13th) (omitted).

(B) The situation of Communist army attacks after the expiration of the specified deadline for the cessation of conflict. Northern Jiangsu: (1) The Communist New Fourth Army gathered five or six regiments and launched a fierce attack on the government army west of Jiangyan Town (east of Taixian County) on the morning of the 14th. One battalion commander and many soldiers were killed. The attack is still continuing. (2) The Communist army continued to occupy the Damiao Station on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway on the morning of the 14th and burned the station's machinery and sleepers. (3) The Communist army continued to besiege Xin'an Town on the 14th.

Shandong: (1) The Communist army attacked Yanzhou, Lincheng, and Chuanshan on the 14th with increased ferocity. (2) On the morning of the 14th, the Communist army launched attacks on Zhoucun and Zhangdian on the Jiaoji Railway. (3) At 3:00 a.m. on the 14th, the Communist army on the Jinpu Railway line from Lincheng to Hanzhuang and the Lanzao branch line once stopped attacking. The Communist army on the front line of Wang Hanzhuang even sent a letter to the government army, roughly stating: We (the Communist army claiming themselves) have received a ceasefire order. If the National army attacks, we will defend ourselves, etc. However, by 3:00 p.m. on the same day, the Communist army resumed attacking Zaozhuang and the Zaozhuang coal mine, and continued to attack government troops in various places for twenty-four hours.

Southern Henan: (1) The government army had already entered Guangshan City before the specified deadline for the cessation of conflict. According to a report from Commander-in-Chief Sun Weiru, there was not a single Communist soldier in Guangshan City on the 13th. It is evident that the Xinhua Daily's claim that the Nationalist army attacked Guangshan City after the expiration of the deadline for the cessation of conflict is entirely fabricated. (2) At dawn on the 14th, the main force of the Communist army under Li Xiannian launched a fierce attack on the 185th Division of the government army south of Luoshan from Dingyuandian (35 kilometers south of Luoshan). The division, strictly adhering to the order to cease conflict, did not retaliate, resulting in significant losses and was forced to retreat to the area 35 kilometers southeast of Xinyang.

Northern Henan: (2) On the afternoon of the 14th, the Communist army increased its forces to Anyang and Xiuwu, while intensifying its siege of the two cities.

Shanxi: (1) The 28th, 29th, and 30th Regiments of the Second Military Sub-district of the Communist Taihang Military District, totaling more than 2,000 troops with multiple artillery pieces, under the command of Lu Ruilin, Commander of the Sub-district, besieged Shitie Town, 30 li northeast of Jincheng on the Zhengtai Railway, on the morning of the 14th. By 4:00 p.m., the Communist army had increased to more than 4,000 troops, and the siege intensified. (2) On the morning of the 14th, Communist army units attacked the Fen Shui Ling belonging to Wuxiang, southeast of Shanxi. (3) More than 2,000 Communist army troops were approaching Fenyang County City on the west side of the Tongpu Railway on the morning of the 14th. (4) The Communist army is still besieging Zhongyang, Jiaocheng, Quwo, Yicheng, and other places. (5) The Communist army is still extensively destroying transportation lines in Shanxi. All of the above demonstrate that the Communist army has failed to comply with the provisions for the cessation of conflict and continues to attack in various places after the deadline, while the government army has strictly adhered to the order and repeatedly made concessions. The facts are clear. As for their claim that the National army entered Guangshan after the ceasefire, it is also a complete fabrication. In addition to notifying the Military Mediation Executive Department to handle the matter, this committee originally intended not to publish it, to show the government's tolerance and determination to cease conflict. However, because the Communist newspaper obliterates the facts and falsely accuses the National army, it has no choice but to refute it.

[Dispatch from a United Press Correspondent with Troops in the Northeast, 15th] According to sources here today, three hours after the order to cease conflict in various parts of the Northeast was issued at midnight on the 13th, the Communist army launched a counterattack and retook Yingkou. It is reported that the National army had recaptured the city five days earlier. It is also alleged that 5,000 Communist troops simultaneously violated the ceasefire order and occupied Goubangzi, Panshan along the Yingkou railway line. However, the National army repelled the Communist army and completely occupied the area today. According to reports, when the Communist army attacked Yingkou, a small number of National army stationed there resisted in an attempt to defend the city, resulting in some casualties. The number of Communist troops was at least five times that of the National army. Initially, there was only a small conflict, which then escalated into a large-scale war.

### Xu Kan Flies to the Capital Today

Representatives of the people from southern Anhui came to the capital to request the Ministry of Food to appropriately reduce quotas, improve grain collection and transportation methods, and severely punish unscrupulous public officials at the grassroots level of Anhui's grain administration. The Ministry of Food has accepted all of these requests and will discuss solutions after Minister Xu arrives in the capital.

### The Ministry of Finance Resumes Payment of Matured Bonds and Coupons

### Three Thousand Factories Left as Empty Shells, Difficult to Fully Restore Within Three Years

[Dispatch from Shenyang by the Central News Agency, 13th] The essence of Japan's 14 years of construction in the Northeast is all in Shenyang, which is also the crystallization of the blood and sweat of the 35 million compatriots in the Northeast over the past 14 years. According to experts, the high level of industrial development in Shenyang has surpassed that of Japan itself. As a result of Japan's concentrated efforts in construction, it had achieved the leading position in light industry in the Far East by last year. The total amount of investment by the Japanese in the more than 3,000 large-scale factories in Shenyang is still unknown, but one thing that can be said is that the total amount accounts for more than half of its total industrial investment in the country. Within three days of Japan's surrender, all factories in Shenyang were intact and undamaged. Unfortunately, they were soon destroyed, and all the essence was reduced to ashes. Among the factories operated by the Japanese in Shenyang, the larger ones numbered about 3,000, divided into (1) the western railway district, 489 factories; (2) the Dadong district, more than 400 factories; (3) the northern district, including the Haicheng district, more than 300 factories; (4) the Xiaoxi district, more than 300 factories; (5) the Nanshi district, more than 200 factories; (6) the Beishi district, more than 200 factories; (7) other urban areas, more than 300 factories. In the western railway district, where factories are densely located, 90% of the factory buildings have become empty shells, and even the windows and doors have been removed. The factories in the Dadong district have been burned down, and embers still remain. In the Dabeiqu and Xiaoxiqu districts, only broken machinery is scattered all over the ground. Major components are missing. The factory buildings in the Nanshi and Beishi districts are lying in deep snow, making it difficult to distinguish them. According to experts, it is unlikely that all factories in Shenyang can be restored within three years. In order to supply rice and wheat, the Shenyang Municipal Government is currently trying to put the rice and flour factories into operation. A small number of other factories may also be restored first.

### UN General Assembly Holds Meeting on the Eve, Discussing the Selection of the Secretary-General, Churchill, Wallace, and Lie Are All Mentioned, Britain Will Propose the Establishment of a World Security Council

[News from Our Newspaper] London, 15th, broadcasted that US Secretary of State Byrnes visited British Foreign Secretary Bevin tonight for a long and confidential talk. British Prime Minister Attlee will host a banquet for all representatives of the United Nations General Assembly tomorrow and deliver a speech. The United Nations General Assembly passed two important resolutions this afternoon: (1) To establish an atomic energy committee chaired by the five major powers and Canada; (2) The British motion to increase assistance to the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration was referred to the Economic and Financial Committee and the Legal Committee.

[Dispatch from the United Press] London, 15th, the United Nations General Assembly continued its policy debate today. At that time, Gu Weijun, the acting chairman representative of China, will deliver a speech. In addition, the five major powers have not yet reached an agreement on the candidate for the Secretary-General of the United Nations organization.

[Dispatch from Reuters] London, 15th, the foreign correspondent of the Conservative Party's Daily Mail reported today that the United Nations General Assembly discussed the issue of inviting Churchill to serve as the first Secretary-General of the Assembly last night, but the foreign correspondent of The Times said that although several names were mentioned again, no candidate was selected. The Daily Mail also stated that this development may indicate the difficulty of the representatives in making a decision and the feeling that only a person of great qualifications is suitable for this position. Most members at the meeting last night were quite doubtful whether Churchill would accept this proposal. The annual salary of the Secretary-General of the Assembly is 9,000 pounds in British currency, and is exempt from taxation.

[Dispatch from the United Press] Washington, 14th, a party proposed former US Vice President and Secretary of Commerce Wallace as Secretary-General of the United Nations Organization. The report stated that a certain "Soviet group" had proposed Norwegian Foreign Minister Lie as a candidate for Secretary-General of the United Nations Organization. Lie denied this today, saying that he did not know of any so-called "Soviet group." As for whether he would be willing to be nominated as Secretary-General, it was all speculation.

[Dispatch from the United Press] New York, 14th, the New York Times today carried a London dispatch stating that Britain will propose the establishment of a World Security Council at the United Nations General Assembly this week. The differences between this "World Parliament" and the existing United Nations organization are two: (1) The five major powers do not have veto power in this parliament; (2) How to deal with countries that violate the law in the future should be voted on by this parliament, not just by the Security Council.

Britain Plans to Transfer African Trust Territories to the Trusteeship Council, but Will Still Retain its Administrative Power

[Dispatch from Reuters] London, 15th, according to well-informed sources, Britain will formally notify the United Nations General Assembly that it intends to transfer the British trust territories in Africa, namely Tanganyika, Cameroon and Togoland, to the United Nations Trusteeship Council, but Britain will still request to retain its administrative power within these lands. What Britain hopes for now is that the Trusteeship Council will take over the original tasks of the Mandates Commission. Regarding the future status of Palestine, Britain advocates that a decision should be made only after the British-American Palestine Investigation Committee completes its investigation.

[Dispatch from the United Press] London, 14th, British officials today expect that British Foreign Secretary Bevin will issue a statement on Britain's transfer of the League of Nations trust territories to the United Nations Organization for trusteeship. According to British officials, the key to the dispute over the trusteeship system in the committee lies in the Soviet Union's suspicion that the trustee powers will be unwilling to transfer their trust territories to the trusteeship system. The Preparatory Committee's report on the trusteeship system contains a resolution calling on the trustee countries to "take practical steps" to transfer the trust territories to the trusteeship system.

Minority Nationalities and Parties Send Telegrams to the United Nations General Assembly to Petition, Arab Countries Express Their Wishes

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency] London, 14th, according to the Secretariat of the United Nations Organization, the United Nations Organization has received a total of sixteen telegrams from minority nationalities and parties from various countries in the world, requesting the United Nations to take action on the issues raised by them. Classified, three of them are about the current Spanish government, four are about Indonesia, two are about the Jewish issue, and two are about Northern Ireland. One comes from the "Armenian National Committee," requesting membership in the "Republic of Armenia." Another comes from the "Slavic National Committee" requesting Slavic independence. Jeb, Secretary-General of the United Nations Preparatory Committee, has prepared a memorandum for this telegram and sent it to the United Nations General Assembly Committee, which is scheduled to hold a second meeting on the morning of the 15th. Some of the requests are clearly unreasonable, but some may be considered.

[Dispatch from Reuters] London, 15th, a political reporter from this agency stated that the five Arab countries currently participating in the United Nations General Assembly in London plan to work together to obtain representation on the Trusteeship Council. If Iraq can join the Trusteeship Council, then the planned goals of the five countries, Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon, can be fully achieved. Egypt and Lebanon have each obtained a seat on the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council, while Syria has also obtained membership in the Fifth Committee. Therefore, their aspirations have been 75% fulfilled. The victory of the Arab countries in the election is due to the assistance of Britain and South American countries.

### Byrnes Advocates for the Establishment of a Special Committee to Jointly Manage Atomic Energy

[Dispatch on the 15th] The United Nations General Assembly held its first policy debate yesterday. US Secretary of State Byrnes delivered a speech, requesting the General Assembly to quickly establish a special committee based on the proposals of the United States, the Soviet Union, and Britain to manage atomic energy and ensure that this great new invention is used to seek human happiness, rather than to be used for more cruel mutual slaughter of mankind. Byrnes also called for an immediate start to ensure that countries place their land, sea, and air forces under the command of the Security Council, so that they can be used when necessary to stop aggression or restore peace. Byrnes also said that the establishment of a committee to deal with various issues arising after the discovery of atomic energy is closely related to security issues and cannot be separated. This is the only urgent task for all countries in the world. It is hoped that the General Assembly can quickly pass the US government's proposal to consult with the governments of Britain, the Soviet Union, China, France, and Canada, so that the committee can start working on weekdays. Byrnes continued, "Americans did not fully understand their responsibilities twenty-five years ago. Now, the US government and people have a deep understanding of their responsibilities. I dare to represent and guarantee the full and sincere cooperation of the United States. The United Nations Organization was produced by many countries and many peoples in unspeakable suffering and pain, and it must survive. In this atomic age, common interests should unite all free countries to maintain a friendly and peaceful world, which is far more important than any conflict of interest that can cause countries to disintegrate." Countries should cooperate in the United Nations Organization to develop a spirit of mutual understanding, not mutual suspicion. Both large and small countries should regard their power as a sacred right to serve the happiness of all mankind, not for selfish purposes. At this initial stage, it is unacceptable to expect "miraculous" solutions to all kinds of problems. In short, "We must be vigilant against stubborn unbelievers, and we must also be vigilant against stubborn enthusiasts."

### Whether the Japanese Islands Occupied by the US Military Should be Handed Over to the United Nations, the President Has the Right to Decide

[Dispatch from the United Press] London, 15th, according to official sources today, the US delegation to the United Nations General Assembly has not yet reached a consensus on whether the Japanese islands occupied by the US military should be handed over to the United Nations Organization for management. Diplomats in the US delegation favor handing over the Japanese islands to the United Nations for trusteeship, but General Kenner, the military advisor, advocates that those islands with military value should still be occupied by the US military. The final decision will be made by President Truman. The US military believes that if the islands obtained by the United States through war are handed over, there may be a danger of having to use troops to recapture them in the future, which is not a good strategy and should not be done. The United Nations Organization originally agreed to implement a preliminary trusteeship plan when it met in San Francisco. This issue will be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion this week.

### Meeting Highlights: 400,000 Documents Released, 50 Miles of Telephone Wire

[Reuters, London, 15th] The United Nations organization's first General Assembly is being held in the Central Hall, built by London lawyer Sir Buck, who has constructed numerous canals, bridges, and docks worldwide. He purchased the vacant land in Westminster a decade ago and built this Central Hall. Within the blue and gold meeting hall, 250 delegates from the United Nations gather, delivering over 12,000 words of speeches daily. Thirteen British and American stenographers and six French stenographers work in 15-minute shifts, meticulously recording every sentence. Each stenographer can record 250 words per minute. The newly installed telephone lines in the hall stretch for 50 miles, serving 250 telephones used by representatives from 51 countries. In the four days since the assembly convened, over 400,000 documents have been released. Before the assembly, various departments had already published 2.36 million documents, ranging from one-page news bulletins to 350-page reports from preparatory committees, with 2,000 copies of the latter printed. The United Nations organization's cafeteria serves 2,000 meals daily. Politicians from various countries, some of whom have never experienced queuing, must now hold their trays and wait in line. The British Red Cross first-aid station located at the Central Hall averages five patients daily, with a potential for further increase.

### War and Culture: Ancient Artifacts Discovered During Underground Defense Construction

[United Press, Washington, 14th] The National Geographic Society reports that numerous ancient relics have been discovered during underground defense construction projects in various countries during World War II. According to the society's 1945 excavation report, the following findings were made: (1) Caves dating back to pre-Roman times were discovered in Gibraltar, containing human jawbones, vertebrae, deer antlers, and pottery and stone tools. (2) Evidence of Celtic temples dating from 500 to 300 BC was found during the construction of an airfield in England. (3) Ruins of an ancient city dating back to 43 AD were discovered in the Canterbury region of England while inspecting bomb craters. In 1945, ancient settlements dating back 25,000 to 100,000 years were also discovered within the Soviet Union, along with a new island in the Laptev Sea in northern Siberia. Soviet scientists unearthed fossilized bones of an ancient giant, with a skull circumference of 33 inches and a femur length of 33 inches. The University of Chicago claims that layers upon layers of ancient city ruins were discovered 250 miles underground near present-day Baghdad, with evidence of ancient nomadic life unearthed in the lowest layer. Human settlements predating the Bronze Age have been discovered near Baghdad. An expedition team from the Geographic Society's seventh division discovered an ancient city in southern Guatemala, with eight major cities. Investigations suggest it is a relic of the Olmec civilization, predating the Mayan culture. When a British expedition team flew over the Arctic region, they confirmed that the North Magnetic Pole is indeed located at the center of the Sverdrup Islands, about 530 miles closer to the geographic pole than the Boothia Peninsula, which was long believed to be the North Magnetic Pole's location.

### US, UK, and Soviet Responses Delivered to France; Drafting of Peace Treaty to Commence; Italian Deputy Prime Minister Visits London

[Associated Press, London, 14th] According to US officials, the representatives of the five major foreign ministers may resume drafting the peace treaty this week. France requested clarification on the draft peace treaty proposals decided at the Moscow Conference, and US Secretary of State Byrnes delivered the response to French Foreign Minister Bidault yesterday. The response was endorsed by the British and Soviet governments. After receiving the response, Bidault immediately departed for Paris.

[United Press, London, 15th] According to official sources, Italian Deputy Prime Minister Nenni is making an informal visit to Britain and is scheduled to meet with British Foreign Secretary Bevin, Undersecretary Noel-Baker, and representatives of the Labour Party today. The specific topics of discussion are unknown, but it is believed to be related to the peace treaty negotiations. Nenni will undoubtedly take the opportunity to gather the latest intelligence. It is also rumored that Nenni will raise the issue of the eastern border of Italy, which is related to the dispute between Italy and Yugoslavia over the Venezia Giulia region. The future disposition of Italian colonies and all of Italy's international issues will also be discussed. Nenni also intends to strengthen the relationship between the Italian Socialist Party and the British Labour Party.

[United Press, Rome, 14th] The Italian Parliament discussed foreign policy yesterday, while the public held demonstrations demanding the return of Trieste.

[United Press, London, 14th] The United Nations Secretariat announced today that the "Tunisian-Italian Committee" submitted a petition regarding the status of Italians in Tunisia to the United Nations Secretariat, but declined to disclose its contents. In addition, several other petitions have been received from various sources and will be formally submitted to the General Committee of the General Assembly for processing.

[Reuters, Paris, 15th] The Allied Reparations Agreement, established last month in Paris by eighteen nations, took effect yesterday after being ratified by seven countries: Britain, the United States, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Yugoslavia. Since the reparations amount from these seven countries exceeds 80% of the total reparations amount of all signatory nations, the agreement immediately came into effect.

[United Press, Washington, 14th] Wedding rings, dental gold, jewelry, and other items confiscated by Nazi Germans from victims before they were sent to gas chambers will be used to fund the post-war care of liberated prisoners from Nazi concentration camps. (The value of these metal jewels is $5 million.) This decision was approved at the German Reparations Conference in Paris.

### France Attempts to Advance into Hanoi, Creating Tense Atmosphere; French Empire Ruled Vietnam for 80 Years, Neglecting River Maintenance and Causing Years of Famine

[United Press, Hanoi, 14th] The atmosphere here is unusually tense today. Of the city's 180,000 residents, 20,000 are French. The Chinese occupation authorities have prohibited the French from carrying weapons, but armed Vietnamese soldiers of the Viet Minh Republic can freely move around the city. Mr. Bellin, the director of the Hanoi branch of the French Banque de l'Indochine, was recently assassinated in broad daylight. A French spokesperson stated: "The entire north has fallen into anarchy. There are no police in the city, coal supplies are cut off, and trains are stopped. From the French perspective, the situation in Tonkin has not improved since the Japanese surrender. If we are allowed to send troops here, order can be restored in a short period of time." There is currently no indication of when the Chinese troops will withdraw.

[United Press, Hanoi, 14th] Both French and Vietnamese sources indicated today that between 600,000 and 2 million people in Vietnam will inevitably die this year. Due to food shortages and severe cold, deaths are occurring one after another. Within two days, a United Press reporter found 400 bodies in one location in Hanoi. Vietnam has been experiencing famine for years, and this is now the second consecutive year. According to French official estimates, at least 600,000 people died of starvation last year. Viet Minh Republic President Ho Chi Minh announced that the number was closer to 2 million. The food shortage is due to the collapse of dikes in seven provinces of northern Vietnam (Tonkin), causing flooding of the Red River and submerging large areas. The French attribute this flood to the Viet Minh Republic, claiming it is completely incapable of managing the areas left behind by the Chinese occupation army, failing to utilize machinery, and preventing the French from carrying out repairs. The Viet Minh Republic President blames the French, stating that during their 80 years of occupation in Vietnam, they never taught the people how to protect the dikes. Although the American occupation of the Philippines was short, they taught Filipinos how to manage themselves. Rice for Tonkin used to be supplied by Cochinchina (southern Vietnam), but it is now occupied by the French, and the Viet Minh government receives very little. Before the surrender, the Japanese also tried their best to collect rice. The French also use agricultural production to supply themselves. In the disaster areas, supplies must also be provided to the Chinese occupation army and Japanese prisoners of war in concentration camps, further complicating the situation. Vietnamese workers must also be given small rations. The French claim that the Vietnamese have refused their offers to transport rice to help the people, but as soon as transportation is permitted, they will transport rice to Haiphong for relief, even if the Vietnamese seize it and distribute it themselves. The Viet Minh Republic President stated that the Vietnamese do not want the distribution to be managed by the government or French organizations. If the United States or other neutral countries distribute the rice, he would formally offer assistance.

Easing of Attacks on French [Central News Agency, Hanoi, 12th Special Dispatch] The disputes involving attacks on French people that have occurred in the Hanoi city area for the past three days have completely subsided today, thanks to the efforts of the Chinese military authorities responsible for security. Since the Japanese surrender and the entry of British and French troops into southern Vietnam, the poor discipline of the British, French and Indian troops and the improper handling by some military officials have led to continuous incidents of suffering for overseas Chinese since mid-September of last year, causing countless losses of robbery, death, and destruction to the overseas Chinese in Cochinchina. The overseas Chinese in Tonkin, motivated by righteous indignation, formed an organization to support the Southern overseas Chinese disaster relief effort. Unexpectedly, three days ago, an announcement was torn down by the French, leading to conflict. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Vietnamese revolutionaries transformed the situation into Vietnamese attacking the French, with more than a dozen incidents of French people being attacked in the past three days. Our military authorities stationed in Vietnam regret this unfortunate incident. Since our troops entered northern Vietnam to accept the surrender, we have maintained a neutral attitude towards both the French and Vietnamese. Now, in light of the strong public sentiment among overseas Chinese, we have immediately urged overseas Chinese to consider the overall situation and cease all activities. The planned memorial meeting for deceased overseas Chinese and the parade will not be held.

### List of Candidates for the Supreme Soviet

[United Press, Washington, 14th] The list of candidates for the Supreme Soviet was released today. General Colonel Kovalev will succeed Marshal Zhukov as Chairman of the Soviet Council of People's Commissars. Marshal Voroshilov was nominated as a candidate at the same time as Stalin, Molotov, and Rodionov last week, but his new position has not been specified. Ambassador to the United States Maxim Litvinov and Ambassador to the United Kingdom Gusev are both candidates, but former Ambassadors to the UK and the US Litvinov and Maisky are not on the list.

### Prime Minister Shidehara Resumes Duties After Recovery, Attends First Cabinet Meeting; Implementation of MacArthur's Directives Still Faces Difficulties

[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] Prime Minister Shidehara, who had been resting at home since January 26th due to pneumonia, has resumed his duties today after twenty days of convalescence. He arrived at the Prime Minister's official residence before 10:00 AM and attended the first meeting after the cabinet reshuffle. According to various newspapers, the government is encountering significant difficulties in implementing MacArthur's directive to purge politics. The status of most of the 47 local governors is questionable, and the cabinet is struggling to cope. According to MacArthur's directive of January 4th, all key officials who participated in local branches of aggressive parties such as the Imperial Rule Assistance Association must be purged. However, many Japanese local governors also served as heads of local branches of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, creating a problem. According to Asahi Shimbun, the government is reluctant to replace local governments. The original plan was to apply this directive only to the secretaries-general of local branches of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. However, the new Minister of Home Affairs, Mitani, stated in his first interview with the press that he would replace local governors as soon as feasible. In addition, the cabinet finds it difficult to decide on the future of hundreds of other civil servants within the scope of the directive. Regarding the election date, MacArthur has granted permission for it to be held anytime after March 15th, and final preparations are underway. The abolition of military pensions is also a major issue for the Shidehara Cabinet.

[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] Japan is scheduled to hold a general election around March 15th, an unprecedented event in history. Several Shinto and Buddhist monks and two Christian leaders will also join the election.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th Special Dispatch] Tokyo Governor Nagahiro Hisakuni resigned from the Ministry of Home Affairs today. His resignation was influenced by MacArthur's headquarters' order of the 4th, which required more than 20 people to resign. During the war, Nagahiro was a director of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association.

### Tokyo Abolishes Licensed Prostitution

[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] Police authorities announced today the abolition of 61 licensed brothels scattered across five concentrated areas. This is the latest development in Japan's democratization. This measure follows the abolition of human trafficking, which has been in effect in Japan since 1886, allowing impoverished families to sell their daughters into slavery. The abolished licensed prostitutes number 300, but they can continue to operate under the guise of "hostesses." It is estimated that there are currently over 2,500 unlicensed prostitutes in the Tokyo area, and their numbers are increasing due to the influence of the black market.

### To Commemorate the Late President Roosevelt, Various Countries Issue Commemorative Stamps; Roosevelt's Stamp Collection to Be Publicly Auctioned in New York, Becoming a Major Event of the Year

[United Press, New York, 15th] The name of the late President Roosevelt will continue to hold a significant place at this year's philatelic celebrations. At least five countries are planning to issue Roosevelt commemorative stamps. The public auction of his stamp collection in New York will also be a major event.

The most recent country to announce a Roosevelt commemorative stamp is the Republic of Haiti in the West Indies. It is said that the country will issue two black stamps, 20 centimes and 60 centimes, on January 30, Roosevelt's birthday, in commemoration.

Other countries preparing to issue Roosevelt commemorative stamps include China, Greece, Nicaragua, and Cuba. Liberia already has a 2-cent airmail commemorative stamp and two other ordinary commemorative stamps on the market. Nicaragua's commemorative stamps will be officially issued in June of this year, with six ordinary stamps and five airmail stamps currently being printed at a company in Philadelphia.

There are several Roosevelt photos on the stamps. One is of President Roosevelt sitting and examining his stamp collection with a magnifying glass. Others include a photo of Roosevelt with former British Prime Minister Churchill, Admiral King, and Admiral Stark during the Atlantic Charter discussions in August 1941; the signing of the declaration of war against Japan; and a photo with Churchill and Stalin at the Tehran Conference in November 1943. A photo taken in Casablanca in early 1943 with Churchill, de Gaulle, and Giraud will also appear on Nicaragua's commemorative stamps.

The US Post Office has only confirmed the issuance of two new stamps this year. One is the aforementioned 5-cent Roosevelt commemorative stamp, and the other is a military transport commemorative stamp, which will be issued in February. However, the design has not yet been announced.

Sweden will issue a new blue stamp to commemorate the 125th anniversary of the Swedish savings movement. The face value is 10 öre. The stamps are uniformly square, without serrated edges, but are only sold in books. The remaining 10-öre and 40-öre stamps with serrated edges will also be issued at the same time. It has been exactly 25 years since airmail service to the Americas began. Colombia has printed three stamps to commemorate the anniversary.

### Churchill Arrives in New York, Denies Rumors of Retiring from Political Life, Will Visit Roosevelt's Home in Hyde Park

[Reuters, New York, 15th] Churchill, accompanied by his wife, arrived in New York aboard the Queen Elizabeth. Hundreds of people welcomed him. After disembarking, Churchill was surrounded by 200 journalists who bombarded him with questions. One journalist asked if the rumors that he was retiring from British political life were true. Churchill seemed surprised and said, "This is the first time I have heard of this. I have not considered it yet." Regarding Palestine, Churchill believes that this issue should not be handled by one country alone. He also told reporters that he hopes to visit Hyde Park and Roosevelt's home. A reporter asked if he was satisfied with the report that Hitler was dead, and he replied, "I believe Hitler is no longer alive." Regarding the secret of the atomic bomb, Churchill believes that the secret should not be given to others until there is a proper international agreement for its control. When reporters asked him to express his reaction to the British Labour government, he declined, saying he did not want to discuss domestic politics.

[United Press, New York, 15th] Churchill said: "I hope to meet with President Truman in Fulton, Missouri, on March 5th and plan to give a speech there. I do not intend to stop leading the Conservative Party immediately, but must wait until there is a substitute."

### War Criminal Koki Hirota Turns Himself In to Sugamo Prison

[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] Former Japanese Prime Minister Koki Hirota turned himself in to Sugamo Prison today to be tried as a war criminal.

[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] Japanese Navy Lieutenant Commander Otaki, who was arrested on November 6 of last year on suspicion of being a war criminal and detained in Sugamo Prison, has been released due to insufficient evidence. Otaki is very familiar with the living conditions of important Japanese war criminals, such as Japanese military leaders, cabinet members, and industrialists, in Sugamo Prison. He said that all important Japanese war criminals now have a fatalistic attitude. Before going to Manila for trial, Lieutenant General Homma expressed that the world has changed and that even the issue of the Emperor's survival is being discussed. Homma's words can represent the psychology of war criminals in general. Former Prime Minister Tojo often sits alone with his head down, looking dejected. The only book he reads in prison is "The Door of Power." Former Minister of Justice Matsuzaka, during whose tenure Sugamo Prison was built, once said: "If I had known I would be imprisoned here, I would have made sure to build it better." Former Commander of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Toyoda, no longer has the same prestige. He wears his military cap and often strolls around the prison, looking arrogant. War criminals sometimes gather to chat, but never mention the issue of trials. They are called outside by American military police for exercises, and they enter in single file for meals and sit down in order. Tojo sometimes does duty. He believes this method is in line with democratic ideals. In addition to working, war criminals also play cards during their free time and take a walk in the yard for one hour every afternoon. American prison guard Harley personally inspects the prison and listens to the complaints of the prisoners without any resentment. He approves all requests from the prisoners within the possible range.

### United Nations Delegation to Leave for Japan This Week

[United Press, Washington, 15th] According to US State Department sources, the United Nations delegation planning to visit Japan to investigate the textile industry is expected to leave for Tokyo this week. Although the date has not been confirmed, it is believed that preparations will be completed by Saturday at the latest. It is said that the main purpose of the delegation is to study what methods can be adopted to restore the production of the Japanese textile industry as soon as possible to meet the daily needs of the Japanese people. In addition, the delegation may also consider a long-term production plan for the Japanese textile industry.

### Soviet Union Promotes Plan to Develop Far East Fisheries

[Reuters, Moscow, 15th] After launching seven lightning strikes against Japan and gaining control of South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, the Soviet Union is now thoroughly managing them with full force. The fishing industry is gradually recovering and expanding. Factories are being established, and port facilities are also being increased. Workers and experts from the western Soviet Union are flocking to this new region. The Soviet Union has stipulated that the harvest of the country's Far East fisheries will be doubled this year. The Soviet Union has a far-sighted and ambitious plan to develop its Far East, and the recent design for South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands occupies a key position in the plan.

### US Wartime Officers Demobilized

[United Press, Washington, 14th] Of the 1,558 US wartime army officers, more than half will be demoted or discharged. A total of 469 generals will be demoted. The remainder will either retire or be discharged. Their names will not be released here, but may be announced at the front. Approximately 500 remaining officers will continue to serve after July 1, 204 of whom will be demoted. Colonels and other battlefield officers will be reduced in rank and number in order to conform to peacetime military systems.

### US Labor Strikes Continue

[United Press, New York, 14th] Although the nationwide telephone workers' strike has ended, new strike actions loom across the country. Since the end of the war, the United States is entering one of the most serious weeks of labor negotiations. National and long-distance telephone service, after a three-day interruption, has now been restored.

[This Paper's Report] A San Francisco broadcast on the 15th stated: "The US labor strike is intensifying. 200,000 electrical workers went on strike today. In addition, 200,000 to 335,000 packinghouse workers, butchers, and others are also preparing to strike."

### Major Losses for Overseas Chinese in Dacca Fire, India

[Central News Agency, Calcutta, 14th Special Dispatch] A major fire occurred at the Overseas Chinese industrial center of Dacca, five miles from Calcutta, last night. 50 out of 200 leather factories operated by Overseas Chinese were burned. Property losses are estimated at over 4 million rupees. There have been no reports of casualties so far. The Consul General of our country stationed in Dacca visited the site this morning to investigate the cause of the fire and plan for the relief of the affected factories.

It is reported that a total of over two hundred traitors are to be arrested and imprisoned, and their confiscated property will be placed under the custody of a liquidation committee, pending transfer to the judicial authorities after a certain period. Furthermore, the Zhejiang High Court, considering that Zhang Juansheng, the former head of the puppet Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, Lu Shanshi, the former head of the puppet Department of Finance, and Wang Wuquan, the former chairman of the Hangzhou puppet Chamber of Commerce, conspired with the enemy and their guilt was conclusively established, especially Wang, who offered the enemy money and materials worth over 260 million puppet currency to Jiangxi, an unpardonable crime, has filed public prosecutions against them in accordance with the regulations for punishing traitors.

Wuxi: Russian Loses Huge Sum of Money in Train. Three Russian-American employees of the Shanghai Jiangwan Airport repair shop, Ivordin, Broshaekov, and Iseshkani, took a special express train to Nanjing the night before last, intending to transfer to Qingdao. When the train passed through Wuxi station, the three, feeling hungry, returned to their compartment to eat. They entrusted two leather bags to someone for safekeeping. After eating, they returned to their seats but the person entrusted with the bags was gone. The overcoat and 7.5 million yuan in legal tender inside the bags were completely stolen. Upon arriving in Nanjing, the station telegraphed Shanghai, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou stations to investigate, but no clues were found. Yesterday, Ivordin and the other two returned to Wuxi from Nanjing to inquire at the station, but there was still no news. They then returned to Shanghai to report the theft and request investigation.

Changzhou: Implementation of a Surprise Household Registration Check. The commander of the XXX Army stationed in Changzhou, in order to effectively maintain local security and strictly prevent undesirable elements from mingling with the population, specially ordered the Political Department of the Army to launch a surprise household registration check on the evening of the 12th. The operation was conducted by the department, in conjunction with the special commissioner's office, military police, and local party and government agencies, mobilizing over a thousand officials and police officers, divided into one hundred and ten groups. At 9 PM that night, the groups gathered at the Army Political Department, where Deputy Director Guo gave detailed instructions on the precautions to be taken during the check. The groups then set out, with the urban area and suburbs designated as the areas for implementation. Soldiers from the Army's directly subordinate units were responsible for security. After the personnel of each group departed, they were accompanied by the heads of the respective towns and villages to check each household, until the operation concluded at 7 AM the following morning. As a result, a total of 324 stragglers and suspicious individuals were found (including 22 women). The 23 individuals with more serious offenses were interrogated and dealt with by the military law department of the military headquarters, while the remainder were sent to the county government for separate handling.

Songjiang: Establishment of Charity Fund Arrangement Conference. The board of directors of the charity funds and properties of the former Songjiang district had already been appointed by the special commissioner's office of this district to reorganize them during the occupation. Now that the reorganization period has expired, the inaugural meeting was held yesterday (the 13th) at Zuibaichi. Zhang Zhuocheng, Zhang Huanzhi, Shen Siqi, and three others were elected as executive directors, and eight important proposals were passed.

Pinghu: Newly Appointed County Magistrate to Take Office on Schedule. The newly appointed county magistrate of this county, Mr. Zhong Shuren, is scheduled to arrive in Pinghu from Hangzhou on the 26th of this month to assume his new post. In recent days, the various departments of the county government have been preparing to finalize the handover procedures, and the accounting office is currently auditing various accounts in order to hand them over. Yesterday, the county party headquarters and the Provisional Council held a special banquet to bid farewell to the former County Magistrate Guan.

Jiaxing: Silk Factories in This County Prepare to Resume Operations. The silkworm silk industry in Jiaxing has always been developed. During the occupation period, the enemy puppets controlled it, arbitrarily cutting down mulberry trees in the countryside, so the silkworm silk industry was worse year after year. Now that victory has been achieved, the China Silk Company is paying close attention to the Jiaxing silkworm silk industry, and the backbone of the Jiaxing silkworm industry plans to prepare for the resumption of operations of the Hedifu Hing Company to help unemployed workers. A preparatory meeting has been held in Shanghai, and it has been decided to raise a capital of 50 million yuan to purchase raw materials to prepare for the resumption of operations.

Huzhou: Youth Army Returning from Abroad Arrives in Hangzhou. The Second Division of the Youth Army, which recently returned from India, Manila, and Burma, arrived in Hangzhou the day before yesterday and is temporarily resting at the original site of Zhijiang University at Zhakou. It is reported that a unit of troops will be transferred to a certain location in the near future to be stationed for defense.

Xi'an: Opening of the First Provincial Assembly. The first session of the Shaanxi Provincial Assembly was held at the Shaanxi Social Service Office at 9 am on the 5th. Eighty-seven members attended, and heads of various agencies and local elders were also invited, totaling about 200 people. Chairman Wang Zongshan presided over the meeting and delivered a speech, saying: "This conference is held after the victory, and we should follow the instructions of Chairman Chiang, perform our duties faithfully, but I feel that my knowledge and experience are shallow, and I am afraid of failing the trust, and I hope that all parties will give more guidance, and I hope to be loyal to the party and the country, seek welfare for the people, and plan for local autonomy and development," etc. Deputy Director Li gave a reply.

### Peace and Unity Cast a Thousand Rays of Light: The Consultative Conference Opens a New Page

January 10th, 1946 at 10:00 AM is the starting time of a new history. The Political Consultative Conference, hoped for by the people of the entire nation, opened in Chongqing.

After the new rain in Bashan, the flowers and trees in the National Government were especially green, verdant and bright, setting off the infinitely lofty and majestic palace, and the atmosphere was especially magnificent. In the hall, dark red curtains were low, and the yellow velvet carpet was thick and soft. The camellias on the rostrum smiled and welcomed people.

The honor guard lined up in front of the National Government gate, solemnly saluting each representative. Except for Mr. Zhang Junmai and Mr. Modale, who have not yet returned to Chongqing, all thirty-eight representatives took the small cars allocated by the Secretariat and arrived early. The seventy-five-year-old Mr. Shao Congen was still supported by a young lady as he had been previously, and walked up the steps to enter the venue.

Zhang Qun and Zhou Enlai Took the Lead. Mr. Zhang Yuejun and Mr. Zhou Enlai arrived before the meeting began. At 8:00 AM, they were in a small parlor at the residence of Special Envoy Marshall in Yiyuan, conducting negotiations on the signing of the ceasefire order. Therefore, when they walked into the venue, the entire room focused on Mr. Zhang Yuejun's smiling face. This smile brought unlimited joy to the conference.

The representatives' seats were divided into two rows and four rows, and behind them were newly opened seats for reporters and special guests.

Chairman Chiang Entered the Venue to Thunderous Applause. After all the attendees were seated, Chairman Chiang, amidst enthusiastic applause, stepped into the venue from the door in the right corner of the venue. The Chairman wore a grass-green military uniform, snow-white gloves, and shiny black leather boots. He was mighty and radiant, and his face was full of benevolent and joyous expressions, illuminating the entire venue. For a time, apart from the rise and fall of the spotlights and the sound of cameras, the attention of the entire venue was completely focused on the Chairman's smiling face. He nodded frequently to the representatives and slowly walked up to the podium.

The Announcement of the Ceasefire Order Filled the Room with Joy. Secretary-General Lei Ting reported the number of attendees and the meeting began:

The Chairman respectfully read the will of the Founding Father and, in his address, first said in a clear and joyful voice: "The negotiations on the cessation of military conflict have yielded results, and the ceasefire order can be issued today." This was like a thunderclap in spring, causing applause throughout the room, like a myriad of flowers blooming. The mercury lights flashed brightly, and everyone's face flashed with joyful and dazzling brilliance because of this good news.

At the end of his address, the Chairman announced four major events that should be implemented immediately, such as guaranteeing the people's freedom, which made the representatives of all parties present admire and be inspired, and the enthusiastic applause lasted for a long time. Amidst this expression of infinite respect, enthusiastic and prolonged applause, the Chairman stepped down from the podium and sat down in the first seat on the right.

The Old Man's Loud Appeal Touched the Audience. Next, Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Communist Party, and Zeng Qi, the representative of the Youth Party, gave speeches. Mr. Shao Congen, a representative without party affiliation, cried out in an old and moving voice: "This conference can only succeed, not fail. The so-called success is the success of the country, the success of the nation!" He also said: "Congen is seventy-five years old this year and came here with illness. Today, I am saying this with tears in my eyes." Listening to the old man's call for the country, everyone in the audience was moved.

The Meeting Ended and a New History Unfolded. The meeting ended at 11:35 AM. However, the new chapter in China's peaceful unification began to unfold from this moment.

### Surviving Minsheng Steamer Assists in Re-establishment Transportation Work

The Minsheng Company, which was established in the upper reaches of the Jialing River in 1925, initially started with shipping, raising a capital of 50,000 yuan and ordering a shallow-water tanker from Shanghai, 75 feet long, 14 feet wide, and 5 feet deep, with 904 horsepower. It was completed in the summer of 1926 and named "Minsheng." Risking flood dangers, it sailed upstream on the Yangtze River and began operating between Chongqing and Hechuan.

Trial Operation Taking Into Account Both Passenger and Cargo Transportation

When Minsheng started operating, in order to avoid competing with failing colleagues, it decided to operate on the newly opened Jia Lingjiang Chongqing to Hechuan route. Generally speaking, peers mostly focus on cargo transport, shipping schedules are not regular. Minsheng changed to focus on passenger transport, trial operation of regular sailing, in order to benefit passengers. However, during the dry season, the river water drops and cannot be sailed, so the Chongqing to Fuling line was created. Although there are fewer passengers, but also cargo transport, business is still not bad, for Fuling prosperity, has a considerable contribution. At the same time, it was decided to build a more shallow oil tanker, hoping to be able to sail through the Chongqing Hechuan line all year round. In 1928, a new ship arrived in Chongqing, and the Chongqing Hechuan line had ships coming and going every day. At that time, Chongqing lacked repair shops, so a machine factory was set up in Chongqing to solve the repair difficulties. Later, a slightly larger shallow-water tanker was purchased, and three rounds were used to sail the Chongqing Hechuan and Chongqing Fuling lines. With the efforts of the crew, ships were able to depart every day. During the dry season, one ship sailed from Chongqing to Yibin. In 1929, Liu Fuсheng, the post-war relief director of Sichuan, felt that it was necessary to reorganize the shipping industry at that time, and firmly invited General Manager Lu to serve as the director of the Sichuan River Shipping Administration.

After General Manager Lu resigned from his position at the Shipping Administration and returned to the company, he moved the company from Hechuan to Chongqing. At that time, various Chinese steamship companies were still extremely scattered, each acting on its own, and their business was very sluggish. The Minsheng Company knew that the shipping problem in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River was of great importance to Sichuan's external transportation and future development, and the critical situation could not be ignored, so it increased capital and took over steamships that were heavily indebted and unable to operate independently, or negotiated with companies that could merge with Minsheng. In 1931, it discussed with various companies between Chongqing and Yibin, and in the following year, it merged the companies and took over 11 steamships. In 1932, it further reorganized the shipping industry between Chongqing and Yichang, taking over 7 steamships within half a year, merging 4 domestic shipping companies and 1 British shipping company, and extending the route to Shanghai. It also took over 3 ships between Yibin and Chongqing, merging 3 domestic shipping companies, purchasing a Taikoo steamship that was sunk at the bottom of the water, salvaging it and repairing it, and re-purchasing a Standard Oil steamship. After another year, it took over 5 ships from the American Jiejiang Company. At this point, except for the British Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Japanese, German, French, Jufu, China Merchants, and Sanbei companies, the Chinese steamships sailing on the Yangtze River in Shanghai presented a more orderly and unified situation.

Despite Many Difficulties, It Created Three-Stage Sailing

1. After Minsheng acquired a large number of steamships, it encountered a major difficulty. Because the acquired ships were old and in disrepair, and some were simply not suitable for sailing and needed to be thoroughly transformed. The slower ones were used for loading cargo, those with fewer passengers were used for more coal, and those with special passengers were either lengthened, the hull was improved, or the machinery and boilers were used to build new hulls, so as to maximize the speed and reduce coal consumption.

In 1937, the company mobilized all its personnel to collect steamships of all sizes and sailed in three stages to maintain uninterrupted transportation, creating the famous "three-stage sailing" in the history of the shipping industry in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.

As Soon as the War Started, Minsheng's Tasks Increased

When the War of Resistance Against Japan started in 1937, Minsheng had a total of 46 steamships, large and small, with a total tonnage of over 24,000 tons, except for 7 ships still in the dockyards that had not been completed. At that time, Jiangyin was blockaded and Shanghai was cut off. Some pessimists believed that the life of the Minsheng Company was coming to an end. However, Minsheng believed that the start of the country's foreign war was the start of the company's mission, so it took the lead in mobilizing to participate in the war. By 1939, there were 37 steamships with a total of over 36,000 tons. When Nanjing, Hankou, and Yichang were successively evacuated, Minsheng went all out to evacuate government personnel and public property, school teachers and students and books and instruments, and people who took refuge. The withdrawal of various ordnance factories, steel factories, aviation equipment, and private factories was completed in two months in the first phase of 12,000 tons, and in more than half a year in the second phase of more than 80,000 tons, which was transported to Yichang. Two months later, all personnel and equipment were transported west from Yichang. At that time, the ships did not stop for a day, and no time was wasted. Because the upper reaches of the river were rapid and the shoals were dangerous, they used daytime for sailing and nighttime for loading and unloading. The ships arrived at the dock and the hatches had already been opened, and the cranes had been raised. The equipment on both sides was pre-loaded on barges to be loaded. When the ships arrived, the cones had not yet been thrown, and they were towed to the side of the ship by tugboats to load cargo. The workers worked day and night in teams of several or dozens, singing songs. The songs and the sounds of the cranes and whistles on the ships matched and formed a tragic symphony, showing the power of the Chinese people to mobilize and resist the enemy. The tense situation was comparable to "Dunkirk."

After the completion of the evacuation of various places, Minsheng still assumed the responsibility of military transportation on the water in the rear and general transportation. The ticket fees and freight rates were set by the government, but the expenses could not be limited and rose a hundredfold, resulting in insufficient income. The balance of payments was out of balance. After the War of Resistance, there were losses every year, and the support was difficult. Many of the main steamships and crew members were also sacrificed.

Continuous Investment in Business and Large-Scale Expansion

Shipping is the main business of the Minsheng Company. The machinery industry developed along with the shipping industry is the Minsheng Machinery Factory, which is directly operated. After the war, it developed to be able to undertake the repair of all steamships, and more than a dozen new ships and machine factory buildings were newly built. To avoid enemy air raids, in addition to dispersing to the surrounding area, a very large air raid shelter factory was opened in the mountains, where work could continue as usual during air raids. It is the only largest private mechanical factory in the rear and the only boiler manufacturer. The earliest indirect investment of Minsheng was in coal mines, assisting several coal mines in the Jialing River to build a light railway, forming the North Sichuan Railway Company, and promoting the joint organization of various mines into the Tianfu Mining Company, acquiring the machinery and materials of the Zhongfu Company, and mechanizing the mines, with a daily output of more than 1,000 tons of coal, supplying more than one-third of the wartime capital and Minsheng's coal.

After the Scars, Still Hope for More Construction

After eight years of hard work, one victory, the Minsheng Company's steamships first transported the National Army and demobilized personnel to Yichang, Hankou, Nanjing, Shanghai, and other ports. Minsheng currently has more than 6,000 employees on land and water, and more than 80 ships, which is less than 30,000 tons, and less than 2,000 ships can travel on the Chongqing-Shanghai line. The company took on the arduous task of the War of Resistance before reaching adulthood, and it helped the country. It is hoped that all sectors will give more support so that it can quickly develop and move forward after the scars, so as to enhance our recovery and construction. (Ke Zeng)

### The Myriad Ugly Scenes Spread Throughout Guangzhou: Public Trial of Traitor Chen Hongci

— Special Correspondent in Guangzhou, Liang Feng

After the news of the public trial of the arch-traitor Chen Hongci on the morning of the 7th was revealed in the newspapers, it immediately caused a sensation throughout Guangzhou. This was because it was the first case of a public trial of a traitor, and everyone wanted to see it. This man, who had served as the puppet Guangdong High Court President and concurrently as the Military Law Department Chief of the Puppet Pacification Headquarters, was not only a prominent member of the "Wang Jingwei Clique" but also held the power of life and death in this area in the past. Today, he would stand in the very place where he had entrenched himself for five years, where he had sat high on the judgment seat and interrogated countless people, but now he had fallen to the status of a prisoner being interrogated. People wanted to see what kind of face he would show.

A Hook-Nosed, Rat-Eyed, Old, Cunning Scoundrel Reveals His True Form

The time arrived! The presiding judge, associate judges, prosecutor, and clerk, wearing their solemn official robes, entered the court in single file. The bailiffs, holding summonses, brought in the traitor Chen Hongci. He struggled to get through the crowd packed in front of the gate. Hundreds of pairs of eyes, like electricity, were focused on this one spot. Apparently, traitors also know shame, as he lowered his head and walked in, as if knowing the rules, to stand in the defendant's position in the court, bowing deeply to the presiding judge. One wonders what he thought when he saw the judge sitting above him.

Chen Hongci, under the gaze of thousands, was a tall man of six feet. He wore a bronze-colored cotton gown, covered by a gray long robe, Chinese-style leather shoes, and his hair was half bald and streaked with gray. His face was full of wrinkles, his eyebrows and the corners of his mouth drooped downwards, and the right side of his upper lip bulged slightly. His small eyes revealed a cunning glint. From his hooked nose and his composed demeanor, one could see that he was an old, cunning scoundrel.

Vehemently Scolding Wang Jingwei Sounded Particularly Jarring to Listeners

After the presiding judge inquired about his age and birthplace, he began to state his history and self-deceptive traitorous fallacies in an orderly manner, with a slight stutter but still in a vigorous voice.

"Sixty-four years old, from Panyu. In the 30th year of the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty, when Zhang Renjun was the education commissioner of Guangdong and Guangxi, I was admitted as a government-sponsored student to study in Japan. Zhu Zhixin, Hu Hanmin, Gu Yingfen, Li Wenfan, and the traitor Wang Jingwei, among sixty others, were all my classmates..." When he mentioned the traitor Wang Jingwei, the entire court burst into laughter. Everyone felt that the word "traitor" coming from the mouth of a traitor was particularly jarring and amusing. He seemed to have forgotten that he was also a traitor, and openly scolding Wang as a "traitor," such an attitude only earned everyone a burst of laughter. He, however, showed no embarrassment and continued to narrate clearly:

Knowingly Violating the Law, He Calls Himself an Old Judge Who Has Driven a Car for Ten Years

"After studying abroad for four years, I returned to China in the 34th year of Guangxu and served as an instructor at the Qingdong Law and Politics School. In the first year of the Republic, when Hu Hanmin was the governor of Guangdong, I was appointed as the director of the Military Law Bureau of the Governor's Office. In the second year of the Republic, when Yuan Shikai declared himself emperor, I was wanted. At that time, Long Jiguang occupied Guangdong and echoed Yuan, so I had to flee, following Zhu Zhixin, Deng Zhongyuan, and other earlier leaders, to do revolutionary work in Hong Kong and Macau. In the third year of the Republic, when Yunnan revolted, the wanted order was canceled, and the case inside was closed. In the ninth year of the Republic, I served as the director of the Xiamen High Court Trial Office in Gaoyao. In the eleventh year of the Republic, when Sun Yat-sen came to Guangdong, Chen Jiongming rebelled, so I lived in Shanghai with my father. In the fifteenth year, I returned to Guangdong and served as an administrative official, having served as the magistrate of Lechang, Qingyuan, Sanshui, and Dongguan counties. After the purge in the sixteenth year, I returned to the judicial field, serving as the president of the Zhaoqing, Chaozhou-Meizhou, and Shantou District Courts. I resigned in the twenty-first year. In total, I have been a judge for about ten years." When he mentioned Sun Yat-sen, he immediately stood at attention, and everyone, seeing this pretentious and strange behavior, couldn't help but laugh again. At the same time, when he said that he had been a judge for about ten years, everyone sneered at him, probably because he knew the law and violated it, truly wasting his life.

Stuttering and Shaking, He Only Admits to an Ideological Error

The presiding judge used a humorous tone to stop the laughter of the crowd and asked, "When did you join the puppet organization? Why did you join the puppet organization?" He answered, "I arrived in Guangzhou in August of the 29th year, and on September 1st, I joined the puppet government. At that time, the puppet provincial and municipal governments had already been established for four months! (He strengthened his tone, as if being a traitor was not his intention, otherwise he would have returned to the mainland earlier!) I am very ashamed to say that I was forced by hunger and cold. When I was in Hong Kong, Wang Jingwei sent someone to send me a letter, asking me to help establish a judicial institution and saying that he had not broken off relations with the central government and that he had returned to save the country and the people. Therefore, I fell for Wang Jingwei's trick."

The judge asked, "Joining the enemy is a heinous crime. Why didn't you consider it carefully? Even if you returned to the rear, the central government would not deny you food!"

He looked a little embarrassed and replied in a stuttering and trembling voice, "This was my ideological error. This was due to my previous blind faith in Wang Jingwei's character."

Foaming at the Mouth, He Asks the Court to Declare Him Not Guilty

The presiding judge further asked, "The Japanese invaded China, saying 'coexistence and co-prosperity' in words, but in fact, many things could reveal their conspiracy. Why didn't you come over to the right side?"

"I always believed that what Wang Jingwei said was true, and I did not do anything to harm the country or the nation." Chen Hongci argued stubbornly, citing his "meritorious deeds" during his tenure, in which Japanese agents and liaison officers were sent to interfere with the judiciary, but he rejected them sternly. The presiding judge then said humorously, "The Japanese are unreasonable. They don't care who you are. Moreover, did the Military Law Department try cases of anti-Japanese patriotic spies and guerrillas?"

Chen Hongci quickly stated, "The Military Law Department only tried theft cases. Anti-Japanese political cases were all tried by the police department, and the Military Law Department only had the power of trial and no power of decision." He vehemently argued that this crime of his was only a criminal "act" but without the criminal "intent," that he was only deceived by Wang Jingwei, that he did not rely on the power of the enemy puppet regime to cheat, and that he had the "saving the country and the people" facts. He spoke as if he had a strong case, with a colorful and impassioned delivery, waving his arms and foaming at the mouth, revealing the complete behavior of a traitor. Finally, he even shamelessly requested to be declared not guilty and presented a personally drafted defense statement of thousands of words.

The Defendant's Lawyer is Unwilling to Defend a Traitor

The defendant's lawyer, Chen Qipei, then stood up from the lawyer's seat. He only submitted a statement, clearly showing that he was unwilling to appear in court to defend a traitor who was abandoned by the people.

Chen Hongci's hands trembled constantly as he held his confession. After signing the confession, the presiding judge announced that the debate could not be concluded and that the trial would be adjourned to a later date. The court adjourned! Chen Hongci, in a dejected manner, was escorted away under the watchful eyes of the crowd.

The sunlight shone on this seemingly ordinary but infinitely authoritative criminal court. Everyone had listened attentively to the "wonderful arguments" for more than two hours, and now they finally breathed a sigh of relief. The reporters packed up their notebooks and exchanged knowing smiles. This wonderful scene had come to an end! (Guangzhou, January 8)

### First Record of the Tense Negotiation Meeting: Pu De's Untimely Letter from the Provisional Capital - Seeking Peace Amidst Fierce Battle - Zhang Qun's Humorous Demeanor

At the first plenary session of the Political Consultative Conference, Zhang Qun said frankly and humorously, "In order to achieve a successful agreement, the government has finally made concessions on Chifeng and Duolun as conditions to achieve the CCP's desire to unconditionally cease conflicts." Wang Shijie stood up and said, "Last time, Mr. Mao Zedong came to Chongqing and talked for forty-three days. The Political Consultative Conference was postponed for two months. I hope that these fourteen days will be enough." The reporter guessed that Foreign Minister Wang might still be concerned about the conference in London.

The Mysterious Thirteen Provinces and Regions: Due to Zeng Qi's questioning, Zhou Enlai recited the names of the thirteen provinces and regions with current conflicts (according to the Central News Agency report). However, the reporter and several other colleagues there seemed to only hear twelve. It is not known who is right and who is wrong. Now, we can only rely on the Central News Agency's report. Perhaps this is due to the difference in each person's "hearing"? Liang Shuming and Zeng Qi debated and spoke nineteen times, and there were also several times when they stormed out of their seats. According to the new psychological theory, a person's mental state cycles every thirty-three days, and perhaps he was just in a low period. We prefer to listen to verbal battles and fear the sound of gunfire. "Gentlemen use their mouths, not their hands." This is not an Ah Q-style approach; this is a modern democratic approach.

Gladstone's Fist Marks: It is said that the situation in the British House of Commons is even more heated. There is even a fist mark left by Gladstone on one of the seats! Moreover, this is only a new beginning in China! Seeking peace from verbal battles and finding common ground from differences is precisely consultation, and this is precisely the path that the Political Consultative Conference should follow! (Chongqing, January 11, night)

### Fifty Years of Struggle, Eight Years of War Resistance Result: A New Situation Unfolds in the Northeast

— Jiang Junzhang, Special Contribution to This Newspaper, Part Two

The Sino-Soviet Alliance: The Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration were the confirmation of principles, while the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was the specific confirmation. This is because both Britain and the United States are far from the Northeast, and only the territory of the Soviet Union is adjacent to the Northeast. Moreover, there has been a complex diplomatic relationship in the past. Therefore, the convenience given by the Sino-Soviet treaty to China in recovering the Northeast is even more important than the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration.

The Treaty Itself: The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was signed in Moscow on August 14 of this year. The treaty contains five items and two notes exchanged between the Soviet Union and China. The main points are extracted below.

The treaty itself contains eight articles. The main purpose is to jointly defeat Japan and prevent Japan from rising again to invade. Based on this purpose, there is military cooperation, joint use of bases, and joint management of railways. In addition, it is also agreed not to conclude a separate peace with Japan and not to join opposing groups.

Changchun Railway: The agreement on the Changchun Railway contains eighteen articles. The main purpose is to respect each other's rights and interests, strengthen the friendly relations and economic ties between the two countries. The method is to jointly manage and operate the railway, which will be returned to China after thirty years. Its scope includes the Chinese Eastern Railway and the South Manchurian Railway, namely the main and branch lines of the East Qing Railway in the Tsarist Russian era.

Dalian Agreement: The agreement on Dalian contains six articles (with a protocol attached). The Soviet Union recognizes Dalian as an inseparable part of China. Administrative power belongs to China. It is stipulated that import and export are free, and Soviet goods passing through are given convenience or preferential treatment. The effective period is also thirty years.

Lushun Agreement: The agreement on Lushun contains nine articles, stipulating that the port will be jointly used by China and the Soviet Union as a naval base to prevent Japan from rising again to invade. The defense of the area is entrusted by the Chinese government to the Soviet Union, while administration belongs to China. The appointment and removal of administrative personnel in the urban area will be carried out by China with the consent of the Soviet Union. The effective period is also thirty years. There is also an attachment that specifies the waters of Lushun.

Soviet Troops in the Northeast: The agreement on Soviet troops entering the three northeastern provinces contains seven articles, stipulating how the national government will establish institutions, implement rule, and cooperate with the Soviet commander after Soviet troops enter the Northeast for operations against Japan. An additional record states that Soviet troops will begin to withdraw within three weeks after Japan's surrender and will complete the withdrawal within a maximum of three months. (Note: The starting date for the withdrawal has now changed.)

In addition, the Soviet government sent two notes, the first of which stated: "Respect the sovereignty of China in the three northeastern provinces and reaffirm the recognition of its territorial and administrative integrity." The Soviet government also declared that "the assistance given to China in terms of military supplies and other materials is entirely provided to the central government, that is, the national government."

Chinese Sovereignty: In this treaty, we can say that the Northeast has been conditionally recovered. The basis for this condition is the war against Japan and the prevention of Japan's reemergence. The nature of this condition is different from the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Lushun and Dalian leased territories in the era of Tsarist Russia. The differences are: first, administrative power still belongs to China, and the Soviet Union has made a special statement on this point; second, joint management and joint use. All these two points are progressive points in the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and can also explain the general situation of the Soviet Union's friendly attitude towards China.

American Merit: In addition, there is one point that we cannot fail to know, that is, the establishment of this treaty was greatly facilitated by the United States, as can be seen in the report of former US Ambassador to China Patrick Hurley. This point shows that the United States hopes for Sino-US friendship but is even more willing to have Sino-Soviet friendship. In fact, the peace in the East can only be maintained with the friendship and cooperation of the United States, China, and the Soviet Union. The Sino-Soviet treaty provides a concrete solution to the Northeast issue, the fuse of this Sino-Japanese war, which further proves that both China and the Soviet Union accept this trend.

Ensuring Results: Now, I want to draw a conclusion. From the above, we can see that the Northeast is an important issue in recent international politics. We Chinese have struggled for fifty years for the Northeast issue. Li Hongzhang came up with a method of uniting with Russia to control Japan in desperation. Due to the incompetence of the Qing government and the ambition of Tsarist Russia, many abuses arose, and the Chinese regime only managed to survive in a state of limbo. As a result of this long-term war of resistance, we have abolished unequal treaties, and we have transformed from a weak country to one of the five powers. This Northeast issue has also been satisfactorily resolved in law because of the victory. We have also said that the entry of the CCP army into the Northeast has caused setbacks in the reception work. From this, we can know how important unity is to solving national problems. We have struggled for the Northeast issue for fifty years to achieve this result. We must resolutely and firmly maintain this result no matter what.

Under Germicidal Lamps: Revolutionary American Drug Invention - New Penicillin Formulation Process

Inside an American laboratory, pharmacists wear uniforms, stand under germicidal lamps, and mix penicillin with oil and egg yolks. Injections of this new mixture allow the penicillin to circulate more slowly in the bloodstream, slowing its rate of absorption. Injections of penicillin alone often cause dramatic effects in the bloodstream, and the levels drop quickly, so repeated injections are necessary to control the spread of infection.

### Peaceful and Bright, Still More Effort Needed

In the past few days, the Chinese political situation has suddenly presented a peaceful and bright atmosphere, which can be said to have made great progress compared with three or four months ago. However, if we take a deeper, quieter look at the general situation and social conditions, it seems that the peace and brightness at this time are still in the initial stage, and how to cultivate this atmosphere still requires the continued efforts of the people of the country.

According to a special dispatch from this newspaper in Beiping, Robinson, Zheng Jiemin, and Ye Chuangying will heal the wounds of North China in the cooperative atmosphere of the Union Hospital. Zheng has strongly advocated not settling old scores, and Ye also very much wants to integrate rural and urban areas, as if what negotiations could not resolve in nine years could really be completed satisfactorily in two or three weeks. To talk about peace, it is indeed extremely peaceful. However, hearing that Marshal Marshall is disrupting the agreement and advocating for those responsible to be reported is puzzling. The ancients said: Great faith is silent. When it comes to restraint and reporting, the word "faith" has actually been discounted. Confucius said "believed without being told," is difficult to find everywhere today, and is forced to seek the next best, but one hopes to be able to say and have faith, has been satisfied. Since the ceasefire order took effect at midnight on the 13th, logically speaking, if everyone is trustworthy, what supervision is needed? What are you afraid of being destroyed? What's the use of reporting? However, the Jiawang coal mine in Xuzhou Northeast is still being destroyed, the railway north of Lincheng has been demolished, and the Communist army near Hashan is still rushing to work on fortifications. Such things are unavoidable, and there is still some violence in the peace!

According to a dispatch from Chongqing, in the fourth session of the Political Consultative Conference, the Kuomintang representatives proposed a plan to expand the organization of the national government, and before the implementation of constitutional government, they first expressed harmony and co-operation and opened up the regime to show their public spirit. As for the four measures to protect the people's freedom, the government also limited the abolition or amendment of the existing laws and regulations within ten days, hoping to implement them as soon as possible. There are a number of representatives who are passionate and generous, saying that the latter must be done within two or three days, otherwise they cannot discuss the reorganization of the government, which is aggressive and does not seem to be a consultative attitude. Forgive us for saying something unpleasant, the "Political Consultative Conference" is not an organ for the exercise of political power, and the people have not authorized the "Political Consultative Conference," and the reason why the national government convened the Political Consultative Conference today is nothing more than to discuss with all parties and factions and comfort the people, so the gentlemen of the Political Consultative Conference should all think about how they can live up to the people, and they must not think that the national government should be responsible to the "Political Consultative Conference." To hope that the "Political Consultative Conference" is successful, we can only advise everyone to negotiate in a harmonious manner and not to be angry. If you leave in a fit of anger, and if you do not attend, if you do not change your old temper, you will definitely not learn "democratic demeanor," and the peaceful atmosphere will inevitably make people feel thin.

Looking at society again, let's not talk about other places, even if we talk about two or three recent events in Shanghai, we also feel that we have to work hard to be peaceful and bright. Seriously punishing traitors is not only what the people desire, but also the responsibility of the government. However, there are legal procedures for how to report, how to investigate, and how to try cases. In a democratic country, the people value the cultivation of the rule of law, and there is no exception in handling traitor cases. As long as the reporter is willing to bear legal responsibility, the High Court will accept it. At most, any other organ can only assist, not its supervisor, so there is no need to rush around and interfere too much. And the reporters should also recognize the path, be responsible for filing the complaint, and no longer use the mass movement approach, which only makes the society seem to have a state of lack of spirit of law, making the people in the recovered areas seem to be in danger. But on the other hand, the organs or chief officials who should be responsible for the report, knowing that people suspected of being traitors are at large and not asking questions, should not let the people be angry. Just to give an example, for example, Vice Minister of Education Hang in Beijing said that it has been decided to punish the traitors in the education sector, but we do not know when the report will be made? The Central Propaganda Department took over the film institutions during the period of the puppet organization, but who are the traitors in the film industry? For example, those who printed the primary and secondary school textbooks compiled by the puppet Ministry of Education to anesthetize the youth in the recovered areas, which bookstores were they? Which scum are in charge? We only hear a wave of take-overs of bookstores, but we have not seen a report of a bookselling traitor. Like this indiscriminate drag on, it is not necessarily a bright atmosphere.

Prices are rising, and the cost of living is high, so the society is full of air of increasing tuition, raising wages, and strikes. We must admit that people are rational and need food, clothing, housing and transportation. If the life of some people in food, clothing, housing, and transportation, even the minimum level is not enough, and other people are wasting their time, eating, drinking, and having fun, the society will naturally accumulate grievances. But on the other hand, as Wu Kaixian said, in the future international commercial competition environment, how to protect the lives and status of workers will be even more difficult. This difficult future is faced by the entire Chinese industry, not only the workers. Therefore, both labor and management must be of one heart and one mind, tolerate each other for the sake of the country, in order to overcome this difficulty. If you do not see this, and insist on taking extreme measures, then the misfortune of the Chongqing industrial community may spread to Shanghai, and both will be hurt, what is the benefit! As for the matter of increasing tuition fees for private schools in Shanghai in the next semester, it is also worth noting. If the increase is too high, how can the parents of students bear the additional burden? The number of out-of-school children will inevitably increase. If the increase is too small, the school is not enough to pay the expenses, and the teachers have no way to make a living. During the War of Resistance, the lives of public school teachers were the most difficult. In fact, those who wear long robes and rely on salaries are all worried. Now that the war has ended, if we allow the teachers to continue to tighten their belts, can we say that it is fair? The central and local governments should, on the one hand, stipulate the fee standards of private schools, and on the other hand, they should also take into account the difficult life of teachers. They may wish to extract some of the proceeds from the disposal of enemy and puppet industries or other taxes to subsidize the expenses of private schools and designate subsidies for teachers, so that the treatment of private school teachers is not far from that of public schools. We must know that educating people for a hundred years is a national plan, and the government must not be reluctant to spend this money. What's more, we value teachers the same, and we can't create a significant disparity in the treatment of public and private schools among teachers. To hope that the society is full of a peaceful and bright atmosphere, only from all kinds of places can the unequal factors be eliminated in the invisible. If there is no peace, there will be a protest. All peace, all brightness, must start from the word "peace"!

### Gold Notes See Slight Decline, Government Bonds Also See a Reversal, Chinese Stocks Appear Indifferent to Foreign Stock Plunge

Spot gold opened slightly higher yesterday morning, at 883,000, and hovered around 880,000 for quite some time. Later, major Chinese stock holders sold stocks for gold, and general speculative funds followed suit, leading to demand exceeding supply, and a sudden rise to 895,000. At this point, the exchange rate against U.S. dollars rose to 605 yuan per ten taels, leading to some selling of gold for notes, loosening the supply. In addition, as noon approached, short-term holders couldn't hold out, so under the activity of sellers, it dropped to 863,000 at noon. In the afternoon, it fluctuated around 870,000, ultimately closing 7,000 lower than the previous day. Gold jewelry was listed at 94,000, fine silver at 700 yuan, and silver dollars around 440. The black market exchange rate was tighter due to cigarette settlements, with tobacco merchants needing more funds. At the same time, rumors spread of tightening credit, causing slight tension, with interest rates standing at 10 to 12 cents.

The U.S. dollar market saw weak demand from securities firms, and major players were inactive, while retail investors also held a wait-and-see attitude. The market could only follow spot gold. The spread between spot and forward prices widened to around 605 yuan, slightly attracting arbitrage purchases, and the market rebounded to around 1,465 yuan. At noon, it fell due to the decline in the gold market, eventually hovering around 1,440 yuan, closing 7 yuan lower than the previous day. Hong Kong dollars were supplied by the Swatow banks, where the rate was as low as 210 yuan compared to Shanghai, causing both old and new issues to fall due to abundant supply, closing 5 yuan lower for old issues and 1 yuan lower for new issues.

Many government bond holders sold, loosening the market. Intermittent speculative funds provided some fleeting rebounds. Class C bonds initially reached 1,410 yuan, but large holders sold government bonds to buy foreign stocks, disrupting the upward momentum. The market then fell to 1,295 yuan, with retail investors still buying on dips. At noon, it struggled around 1,350 yuan. The closing results showed Class A and B bonds down 80 yuan, Class C bonds unchanged, Class D bonds down 60 yuan, and Class E bonds down 50 yuan.

Chinese stocks fluctuated wildly, with an uncertain trend. Although many profit-takers sold stocks for gold, loosening the supply, the downward pressure was slightly greater than before. General speculative funds continued to participate in the stock market due to the upcoming New Year. There was no shortage of buyers after the decline, and securities firms rallied the market in the final hours, pushing it up again at noon. The closing results showed Wing On Cotton Mill up 120 yuan, American Oriental Bank up 50 yuan, Sincere Company up 30 yuan, King Fook Jewellery up 5 yuan, Sun Kwong up 6 yuan, and Dah Shing up 3 yuan. Unpopular stocks declined slightly due to the earlier closing of the retail market.

Foreign stocks were still driven by Chinese speculative funds, with miscellaneous surplus funds also participating, making them quite popular. Foreign merchants sold heavily at higher prices. When Chinese stocks turned downward, buyers became more cautious, and the market fell by 5% to 10% from the high. At noon, all stocks were priced lower for the closing, with Jardine Matheson down 100 yuan, Wheelock down 1,300 yuan, and Jardine Brewery and China Paper each down 100 yuan.

### Silk Market's Rising Trend Flattens, Silk Fabric Buying Interest is High

The price of artificial silk has gradually stabilized. Yesterday morning, No. 120 "Tianqiao" opened at 1,000,000 yuan, with the highest price being 1,020,000 yuan and the lowest closing at 967,000 yuan. "Dantong" opened at 830,000 yuan, with the highest price being 880,000 yuan and the lowest at 790,000 yuan. Rumors suggest that a large quantity of spot goods will be sold, and the market price may continue to weaken. Retail buyers and regular customers are tentatively buying, leading to high prices. Silk fabric transactions are frequent, and buying interest is very high. Natural silk fabrics have risen by 10% from the previous day. The China Silk Company sold each hundred "Meiya" bed covers at 720,000 yuan, and each yard of "Da Lai Ge Qianbi Crepe" was 2,050 yuan. Artificial silk fabrics like "Minsheng Brocade" and "Huajin Crepe" remained at the previous day's prices, and transactions were quite active.

### Rice Prices Tighten Again

The rice market saw prices rise by 100 to 200 yuan due to gradual increases in production areas. Indica rice and white rice both increased by 200 to 300 yuan. Flour from Nanyang moved without vigor, and prices remained stable. Soybeans from Zhoushan and Fujian remained in demand, and prices rose by another 200 to 300 yuan. Soybean cakes from Swatow were selling well and continued to rise by 100 to 200 yuan. Raw peanuts remained scarce, and sesame seeds were also scarce, with prices remaining unchanged. Although affordable oil was being sold, the oil market saw a sharp increase of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan due to the scarcity of shipments from Ningbo.

### Northern Goods Market Trend Flattens, Dried Longan Production Price Reported High

The northern goods market has seen the trend turned to stability because it rose too much for the last few days, and the dealers were watching. The demand gradually became stagnant. According to a telegram from Quanzhou via Wenzhou, the production price of dried longan was higher than before, and even the price for Shanghai shipment was more than 30,000 yuan. In addition, the time for handling and shipping to Shanghai will be longer, and the interest will inevitably increase sharply, so the profit would only be slight.

### Dyeing and Weaving Industry Resetting New Prices, Effective from This Week

The dyeing and finishing group of the Dyeing and Weaving Association, with 30 factories that also provide dyeing services for customers, has recently adjusted its products and unified the labor costs. Starting from the 14th, the prices will be slightly increased. It is reported that the reasons are the lack of fuel and the long-delayed delivery of goods by De Fu Foreign Firm. The new dyeing prices are listed below (from Grade A Mercerized Shilong to light-colored standard cloth, all are 12 pounds and 40 yards of fine cloth, from Mercerized White Poplin to handkerchief cloth, all are 30 yards of grey cloth, and the last yellow-gray rainproof cloth is also 40 yards of fine cloth, unit of dyeing price: yuan)

### Jianfeng Textile Tender Below, Yarn Market Transactions Few

The yarn market was sluggish yesterday, mainly because Jianfeng Textile Company tendered a large amount on the previous afternoon, which greatly impacted people's confidence. The market price fell by 40,000 to 50,000, and buyers waited and watched, resulting in few transactions. The market situation suddenly became a state of oversupply.

### Lumber Sales Still Good

Recently, the actual sales of lumber in this city have been fairly good, because small carpentry workshops are mostly purchasing materials for decoration, such as Lauan plywood, etc. Building construction in Nanjing is about to start, and several batches have already come to Shanghai to purchase, so the market is quite stable. As for large-scale construction, it will have to wait until the lunar spring. The arrival of foreign lumber is also expected to be around April.

### Tea Sales Active, Market Prices Generally Rising

Since the gradual opening of transportation routes, the flow of red and green tea in this city has gradually recovered. Recently, in addition to the continuous shipments to Tianjin and Jiangbei, other places such as Hankou have also shown signs of recovery. The tea inventory in this city is very weak. Currently, the source mainly relies on land transportation, and there are still arrivals. As for waterways, due to the winter season and shallow river water, it is difficult to load and unload smoothly. Therefore, the market is always regretful for the situation of demand exceeding supply, and prices are also rising rapidly. Yesterday, the price of each variety increased by 4,000 to 7,000 or 8,000 yuan per dan, and the transaction volume did not decrease.

### Tinplate is Scarce and Pricey

24-gauge tinplate is a necessity for manufacturing rollers in cotton mills. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the stock on the market has been almost completely requisitioned. After this victory, small cotton mills are gradually resuming work, and are quite willing to purchase, so the remaining stock is even thinner. It is difficult to find whole boxes, but scattered transactions can still be met. The current price is 7,500 yuan per sheet. The price of other tinplate is also strong. 100-pound double-connected tinplate is selling for 75,000 yuan per box, and 112-pound kerosene tinplate is shouting as high as 35,000 yuan per box, creating an unprecedented new record.

### This City's Business Tax is Collected by the Central Government, Distributed to Local Areas

[This Newspaper News] It has been decided that the business tax in this city will be collected by the Shanghai District Direct Tax Bureau, and a portion will be allocated to subsidize local finances, starting from October 21. It is heard that the business community hopes to continue the simplified collection method of the Finance Bureau, that is, the business tax should be allocated according to the business scale.

### White Tung Oil is Tight

White tung oil has suffered the most since the war. Since the victory, international trade has gradually resumed, and exports are becoming more and more lively. When the prices of other goods fell, only tung oil could maintain its original state. Recently, the prices of other goods have also seen an upward trend, and tung oil has also become tight. The price of tung oil that meets the export requirements is 32,000 yuan per dan, and the price of tung oil that is only for domestic sales is 28,000 to 29,000 yuan. Genuine goods of old brands of Hongjiang oil will be shipped soon, so local products are currently selling for around 22,000 yuan.

### Britain Lifts Trade Controls on China

Effective January 9th This Year

Reuters, London, 15th - The British Board of Trade officially announced that trade controls on China have been lifted. Effective January 9th, 1946, restrictions under the Trading with the Enemy Act on former Japanese-occupied areas of China (including the Northeast) have been lifted, and controls on foreign exchange for trade with China have also been modified.

### Summary of Market Conditions

The price of sugar has slightly declined today because the increase has reached the saturation point, but this factory's white sugar is still not available on the market.

Northern and southern goods, such as walnuts and persimmon cakes, have continuously arrived, and sales are relatively smooth, so the market has loosened.

Stationery is limited by the tonnage of cargo ships, and large items are retained here. Only small packages are transported to Kunming, Chongqing, and other ports by air, and the market is in a swirling situation.

The demand for caustic soda remains strong, and prices continue to soar. It is estimated that the arrival of overseas orders will take about three months. The factories are constantly importing, and the remaining stock is decreasing day by day, so the market price has risen by a huge 40% compared to last Saturday.

### Ministry of Education Holds First Press Conference

Vice Minister Hang Reports on Handling of Peking Provisional University Incident, Reporters Raise Opinions on Strict Rectification of Academic Morale

[Special dispatch from this newspaper in Nanjing] At 3 PM on the 14th, the Ministry of Education held its first press conference in the conference room. More than 30 people attended, including Fang Canglang and Zhang Anyu, reporters stationed in Nanjing for this newspaper, and Cao Tiancong and Wang Muliang, reporters stationed in Nanjing for the News Daily.

Vice Minister Hang Liwu presided over the meeting, reporting on the handling of the incident caused by a few students in the supplementary classes of the Provisional University of the Capital, and the work plan of the Ministry of Education for recovery, roughly as follows:

Recovery Work [Vice Minister Hang referred to himself as a recovery worker], arrived in Beijing in December last year, and strived to implement the measures based on the Post-War Education Conference in Chongqing. In order to facilitate the direct handling of educational administrative affairs in neighboring provinces and cities, the Ministry of Education established offices in Chongqing, Nanjing, and other places in the rear. Therefore, the educational administration of the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai, and the five provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Jiangxi, is currently handled by the Beijing office. Before January 6th, the Ministry of Education had already planned to improve various facilities for education in the recovered areas and rectify academic morale. Unexpectedly, a few students from the so-called "121 Student Association" in the supplementary classes of the Provisional University suddenly caused trouble, demanding the public release of English test papers and improved treatment, resulting in an unfortunate incident. He then reiterated the cause of the incident and the Ministry of Education's handling process. (Details have been seen in previous newspapers, and will not be repeated here). The Vice Minister mentioned that twenty years ago, when studying in Europe, he was a special reporter for newspapers such as News Daily and others.

Provisional University Incident This incident at the Provisional University has been consistently supported by various newspapers, guiding young people to the right track, for which we are deeply grateful. The English professor invited by the Provisional University is a first-rate professor with many years of teaching experience. The reason for the English test is that students in the enemy-occupied areas had too few English hours, resulting in low levels of proficiency. Although they are called university students, some are not even as good as junior high school students. After the test, those with poor proficiency will be given additional tutoring in order to gradually merge them into the class, and there is no malicious intent. As for student welfare matters, the Ministry of Education has tried to order iron beds, add bedding, and provide relief to poor students and students whose families are in the bandit areas. The students receiving relief account for one-third of the total, divided into two categories, A and B. Category A can borrow 3,000 yuan per month, and Category B can borrow 1,500 yuan. We are also in contact with the Army Headquarters to obtain coal to reduce the burden of student meals. The Ministry of Education is determined to thoroughly rectify academic morale, and hopes that all newspapers will support it. He then reported on various matters that the Ministry of Education has recently handled and plans to handle.

Inspect Various Regions (1) Send Ministry Inspector Peng Baichuan to inspect the education recovery work in various recovered areas, such as the extent of damage to school buildings and equipment, and the necessary supplements for recovery. All of this is related to funding, so the investigation must be based on facts in order to achieve practical coordination. (2) Send senior officials from the Ministry and hire experts to jointly supervise the education recovery work in the southeastern provinces and cities, hoping to fully recover within one year, the sooner the better, so that all students in the recovered areas have books to read. This matter is being actively prepared and will begin in Beijing and Shanghai first.

Standardize School Buildings (3) In the planning stage, there is national education. We will strive to standardize the school buildings and classrooms of elementary schools across the country, taking into account lighting, ventilation, student exercise, and physiological hygiene. Engineers will be invited to participate in the design and guidance, so that the future buildings will be very suitable for schools. They will be divided into three categories, A, B, and C, depending on the funding and environmental conditions, but at a minimum, there must be a Category C school building. Special attention will be paid to physical education for elementary school students. (4) For textbooks for primary and secondary schools, the Ministry of Education will unify the nationally designated editions in order to achieve appropriate uniformity after the war. We have entrusted Zhengzhong, Commercial Press, and other publishing houses to jointly print them as soon as possible, and to review and approve the nationally designated and approved textbooks for primary and secondary schools for use in various schools. (5) For social education and mass education, it is necessary to increase the training of civic awareness among the people in the recovered areas. We plan to use radio stations and educational films to popularize the facts of the eight-year war of resistance to farmers in rural areas.

Hold Examinations (6) Urge the holding of examinations for teachers and staff in secondary schools, as well as examinations for teachers and staff in vocational schools and above, and examinations for university graduates. University graduates under the puppet organizations can still be hired on a trial basis. When the Ministry of Personnel later conducts examinations, those who have passed the examination will be issued a certificate by the Ministry of Education, stating that the student is equivalent to a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Laws, etc., but not naming the university from which they graduated. Vice Minister Hang also reported that he is a member of the Committee for Investigating Lost Cultural Relics During the War. The cultural relics investigated and received in various places will be cleared by the Central Government, and people will be sent to Japan to investigate and compile a catalogue, which will be used by our government to demand compensation from Japan in the future. After Vice Minister Hang finished his report, Counselor Zhao Taimou reported that the purpose of the trouble caused by a few students in the Provisional University was to maintain the original student status of the puppet Central University. In terms of administration, many compromises and concessions have been made in accordance with the resolutions of the post-war education conference in Chongqing, and he added many supplements to the details of the incident.

Reporters' Opinions Subsequently, Ma Xingye of the Central Daily News put forward three points, and hoped that the Ministry of Education's educational administrative measures would continue to hold similar talks when necessary in the future in order to exchange opinions. Then, female reporter Pu Lide of the Heping Daily pointed out that special attention should be paid to correcting music, so as to avoid hearing the chaotic, decadent, and inappropriate sounds of the enemy and puppets in the capital again. Gong Debai of the Jiuguo Daily expressed his agreement and expressed his opinion that the Ministry of Education should strictly rectify academic morale. The Ministry of Education expressed its acceptance, and the guests and hosts parted happily. (Fool)

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] Vice Minister Hang answered questions from reporters at the press conference: (1) Various agencies have not refused to hire graduates of puppet universities, but this is only a trial period. During personnel evaluation, it is necessary to rely on the certification documents after the examination by the Ministry of Education. This document only proves their equivalent degree and does not specify which school they graduated from. (2) The Ministry of Education is currently clearing the documents of the puppet Ministry of Education, and will punish education personnel who willingly collaborated with the enemy according to law. (3) The Ministry of Education has telegraphed famous professors such as Feng Youlan and Gu Yuxiu to lecture at various temporary university refresher courses.

### Mayor Agrees to Discuss Economic Assistance Measures for Private Schools with the Bureau of Education

[This City News] Representatives of private primary and secondary schools in this city visited Director Gu of the Bureau of Education yesterday (15th) at 2 PM to discuss subsidies and tuition fees. Director Gu had already heard about the private schools' voluntary implementation of economic transparency measures, and the appropriate increase in tuition fees for students from better-off families, in order to expand the number of free places and provide relief to poor students. Therefore, he repeatedly praised this during the meeting, promising to plan for subsidies and to formulate flexible measures for tuition fees. As for the principals' request for instruction on the 18th, the Director has also approved it. The representatives then rushed to the City Hall, where Mayor Qian immediately summoned them. He inquired in detail about the situation of private schools, and quite agreed with the schools' opinions on enriching their content. He also said that attention should be paid to sports facilities and health education. After being informed that the school buildings of various schools had been occupied, he immediately recorded it in his diary. As for the economic assistance measures for private schools, he agreed to discuss them with Director Gu.

### Ministry of Education Issues a Notice to Ban Puppet Textbooks

[This Newspaper Chongqing News] The Ministry of Education issued a special notice to all education bureaus to strictly ban the circulation of puppet textbooks in various recovered areas, as some bookstores were still publishing puppet textbooks and some schools were still using them, which was inappropriate. (Parrot)

### Middle School Students Should Temporarily Not Participate in Political Activities

Bureau of Education Convened Principals for Discussion Yesterday

[This City News] The Municipal Bureau of Education believes that in recent days, students from various schools have often participated in off-campus activities such as parades, which may affect their studies. Also, the case of the French Consul General obstructing our country's sovereignty may lead to serious international disputes. Therefore, it convened some public and private school principals to the Bureau for a talk at 3 PM yesterday. Attendees included the principals of Jin Yuan Middle School, Lequn Middle School, Shanghai Girls' High School, Minli Girls' High School, and other schools, totaling more than 20. Director Gu first reported the main purpose of convening the talk, stating that middle school students are not proficient in their studies and lack understanding. He hoped that the schools would encourage students to focus on their studies and temporarily not participate in political activities. Subsequently, the principals of various schools reported on the recent situation of students' off-campus activities. However, there were also cases where the names of schools were published in newspapers, but the students did not participate. After discussion, it was decided that on the 18th of this month, the Municipal Bureau of Education would, in the name of all public and private secondary schools in the city, send a telegram to the Political Consultative Conference and the Ministry of Education, appealing to all parties and factions not to allow middle school students to participate in political work, so that they can focus on their studies. Jin Tongyin, the principal of Jin Yuan Middle School, was designated to draft the telegram, and it was hoped that the principals of the schools would go to the Bureau on the afternoon of the 18th to sign and seal it, so as to ensure its timely dispatch and show its importance.

### Education Recovery Funds Approved for 60 Million Yuan, Jiangxi Provincial Government Stipulates Usage

[Dahua News Agency Nanchang Dispatch] The Central Government has approved 60 million yuan for education recovery funds in Jiangxi Province. The Provincial Government has stipulated the usage as follows: (1) All existing schools should be relocated back to their original locations and properly allocated according to administrative regions. Each region should have one or two middle schools and normal schools, and vocational schools should be allocated appropriately. (2) Students should register themselves before the start of school, and no travel expenses will be provided. Travel expenses for the relocation of teachers, staff, and public property should be handled in accordance with the Central Government's measures for the payment of various expenses for the recovery of personnel from agencies in various provinces. (3) The original principals of the schools taken over from the enemy and puppets should hand over all school property for application. (4) Students should be assigned to study after examination, and teachers should be hired after examination. (5) The school buildings of the relocated schools should make full use of existing or received school buildings, and should be repaired and applied as much as possible, without the need to rebuild.

### Brief Reports

The Jiashan Xiuzhou Middle School is currently undergoing restoration. Alumni in Shanghai have scheduled a general meeting for 3:00 PM on the 17th at the Xiqiao Middle School on Dihua Road to celebrate the school's reopening and strengthen friendships.

The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education's Shanghai Municipal Vocational Tutorial Schools, Nos. 3 and 4, began accepting applications on the 14th at the bureau. The deadline is the 19th, and the entrance examination will be held at 8:30 AM on the 20th at the Sapo Sai Elementary School.

### Relieving the Economic Panic of Private Schools

— Zhang Yiqu

Should Promote Three Major Movements: Saving Schools, Respecting Teachers, and Rewarding Scholarship

After the victory of the War of Resistance, educational construction has become a top priority, which no one can deny. However, in Shanghai, private schools in general, whether middle schools or elementary schools, are experiencing extreme economic panic during this period of transformation. To find ways to alleviate this and move forward on the road of "educational construction," I believe we should actively promote the following three major movements:

(1) Saving Schools Movement. Originally, the conditions for establishing a private school were, first, to have a board of directors, and second, to have a foundation. However, the situation in Shanghai is unique. Most private schools only have nominal boards of directors and no fixed foundation. The funding is generally raised through two methods: either lowering teachers' salaries or increasing student tuition. With the cost of living continuing to rise, if tuition is increased, students will not be able to afford it and will inevitably drop out; if we consider lowering teachers' salaries, teachers will not be able to maintain their livelihoods and will inevitably have to change professions. If students leave and teachers leave, can the school itself still exist? Even if a few students who can afford tuition can decorate the school's facade, the school will only be able to hire incompetent teachers who fill the ranks, which will only mislead the students. The existence of the school is worse than its non-existence. To maintain the normal existence of these private schools, we should universally promote a "Saving Schools Movement." The main purpose of this movement is to immediately reorganize the board of directors of the school, invite enthusiastic people from the community to serve as directors, and have the government give honorary commendations to those responsible for raising school funds and stabilizing the school's permanent foundation.

(2) Respecting Teachers Movement. Teachers should receive special preferential treatment from the country and society, which is a universal principle at home and abroad. However, the salaries of teachers in private schools in Shanghai are almost less than those of ordinary shop assistants, and even less than the wages of an ordinary servant. Teachers in primary and secondary schools, who bear the important responsibility of cultivating the nation's young seedlings, receive such meager treatment. Isn't the so-called "teachers first" equal to a series of uncashed blank checks? Therefore, we should actively promote a "Respecting Teachers Movement." The main purpose of this movement is to enable the government and the people to work together to build a psychology of respecting teachers. In addition to raising the salaries of teachers in general, we should also widely collect teachers' aid money to subsidize teachers and stabilize the lives of teachers who are suffering.

(3) Rewarding Scholarship Movement. In the transitional period of raising school funds on the one hand and immediately increasing teachers' salaries on the other, reducing student tuition is not an easy task. If students drop out due to the inability to reduce tuition, it is a phenomenon that the number of students entering a new country suddenly decreases. Isn't this a great shame and a great loss to the country and the nation? Under Chairman Chiang's creed of "Education First in the Period of National Construction," we should not only promote loan programs for poor students, but also actively promote a "Rewarding Scholarship Movement" for general students to complete the new educational construction of a new China. The main purpose of this scholarship movement is to select students with excellent academic performance and give them bonuses to show encouragement; for those who are even more outstanding, give their parents honorary certificates or medals so that parents can develop a mentality of "cultivating children above all else," and save on other expenses to do their best to plan a considerable amount of tuition for their children.

In order for Shanghai's private schools to overcome the current difficulties and to increase the basic construction power of education in the new China, it is hoped that these three major movements can be agreed upon and promoted by the government authorities and school authorities, and enthusiastically supported by the general public, and that they can produce significant and widespread results in the short term.

### Mr. Patterson Receives Reporters, US Policy Towards China Remains Unchanged, Discussed War Zone Situation with General Wedemeyer Yesterday

[Report from this newspaper] US Secretary of War Patterson received reporters at 4:00 PM yesterday on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel. More than 50 representatives from Chinese and foreign newspapers and news agencies attended, accompanied by Patterson's aide, Colonel Gibsper.

Patterson first reported that he arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and discussed the situation in the China War Zone and subsequent issues with General Wedemeyer, Commander-in-Chief of the US Forces in the China Theater, yesterday morning. In addition, he also attended a meeting of 20 US military representatives, who requested to return home. Several requests were made at the meeting, and General Wei was also present at the time. Patterson also said that after leaving here, he would go to the Philippines for inspection and expressed regret that he could not visit Chongqing due to a delay in his scheduled itinerary.

Soldiers' Demands Will Be Considered. Patterson then answered questions from reporters regarding the points raised by the US military, Patterson decided to consider them. The question of the US military's mission in China and whether they could return home immediately would be carefully considered. Patterson added that General Eisenhower's speech to Congress yesterday was very important.

Consistent Policy Remains Unchanged Patterson stated that the US military mission in China and other issues discussed with General Wei were only details and did not involve US policy. US policy was decided by President Truman, and once decided, it would not change. The US policy towards China has three points: (1) to help create a democratic and united China, (2) to eliminate Japanese forces in China, (3) to help China transport Japanese soldiers back to their country.

Situations Differ in Various Places Patterson did not sell the US military's assemblies protesting, etc. He believed that they should appeal to the authorities and request consideration in a proper manner. As for other places, the situation is slightly different from here. Patterson did not see any protests in Japan. In Korea, only five or six people made the same request. Patterson does not intend to have further talks with the soldiers here.

When asked for his opinion on the US military's occupation in China, Patterson said that after the reports from General Wei and Admiral Kirk, commander of the Seventh Fleet, yesterday morning, the US military's occupation force in China was considered very small, which was far different from the US military's occupation force in Japan and Korea.

No Opinion on Marshall Regarding the Allied Control Commission for Japan, it is not yet known when it will meet, but when Patterson left Japan, representatives of the Far Eastern Commission had arrived in Japan and began their work. As for the liaison between the United States and the Soviet Union in Japan, a meeting was held yesterday by the liaison committees of both sides. When asked about Patterson's criticism of Marshal Marshall in Chongqing, Patterson said that although he and Marshal Ma were friends and colleagues for many years, they had not communicated recently, and all communications were only personal matters and had no opinion on their mission.

Regarding the question of Eisenhower's work, it was considered that General Ai had only been Chief of Staff for two months, and he himself did not think that General Ai had any reason to resign.

The Department of the Army Agrees to Set Up an Advisory Group There is currently no feedback from the United States on the establishment of a military advisory state in China. Mayor, Secretary-General Shen Shihua, heads of various municipal bureaus, British and American military and political officers, Deputy Commander Li and Lan of the Garrison Command, people from all walks of life in the city, and reporters, totaling more than 200 people, did not disperse until about 7:00 PM.

While the banquet was in full swing, the lights suddenly went out, and the entire venue was plunged into darkness. Only the glow of cigarette butts and joyful laughter could be heard in the dark. A minute later, the lights came back on, and the male and female guests all raised their glasses to celebrate the coming of "Chongqing's Brightness."

Patterson and Wei Visited Mei's Opera This time, the Chinese Seamen's Union and the National Diplomacy Association, the US Department of the Army quite agree with this move.

Secretary Patterson is scheduled to leave Shanghai for the Philippines today or tomorrow, and then go to various parts of the world for inspection, but the duration of his trip cannot be determined. Patterson stayed in Japan for a week.

Wei Held a Cocktail Party General Wedemeyer held a cocktail party at the French Club at 5:15 PM yesterday to welcome Patterson. Qian, and the four groups of the Chinese Women's Mutual Aid Association came to the city. In order to raise funds to help the families of the martyred sea carriers, Dr. Mei Lanfang and Mr. Gao Hua were invited to hold a charity performance. Last night, US Secretary of War Patterson and General Wedemeyer went to the Empress Theater to admire the wonderful performances of Dr. Mei, Mr. Gao Hua, and the actors, and expressed their appreciation.

### Urge the French Consul-General to Reflect, Students' Parade Out of Patriotism, Lü Huaijun Talked to Reporters Yesterday

Since the French Consul-General in Shanghai, Fei Lihao, secretly arrested the Nazi criminal Frenchman Kako Pino in Shanghai and handed him over to the French warship Berdin for smuggling out of Shanghai, all sectors of this port have expressed indignation and telegraphed the government to take effective action in accordance with the law to protect national rights. The day before yesterday afternoon, 15,000 students in this port held a demonstration against France. Yesterday, the reporter specially visited Lü Huaijun, secretary of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and asked about the latest developments in this case. Mr. Lü answered the following points:

Mr. Li first said that regarding this case, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now in contact with the French government through the French ambassador to China. Before receiving orders from the Ministry, this office does not intend to take any further action. Regarding the rumor that the French Consul-General in Shanghai is still secretly arresting some criminals, this office has not heard of it, but considering the long-standing friendship between China and France, it is believed that the French Consul-General in Shanghai will not take any actions that harm China's legal rights and hinder Sino-French relations.

The reporter asked what the office thought of the demonstration by students in this port against the French Consulate. It was answered that our country is now a democratic country where the people have freedom of assembly and association. The people's assembly within the legal track has its own freedom of activity. Yesterday's student assembly and parade in this port was said to be in very good order. The speaker had seen this kind of thing abroad in recent years.

As for the rumor that the students who demonstrated yesterday took down the French flag from the flagpole at the French Consulate, the speaker had not heard of this and believed that the rumor was not true, because the students who participated in the parade were forced by patriotic enthusiasm, and the purpose was to urge France, which has a long-standing friendship with us, to reflect. The parade was in very good order, and it was said that our military police were guarding the consulate at the scene to prevent individual students from taking actions outside the legal track, so the speaker did not believe that the above-mentioned rumors were true. It was also heard that the Shanghai Student Union had stated that it had not taken the above-mentioned actions. Even if this happened, it should be dealt with in a separate case and should not be confused with the French consulate's violation of our legal rights.

Finally, the reporter asked when the passport visa would be opened. It was answered that this matter is being requested from the Ministry, and the method will be announced soon.

### Fourth Phase of Affordable Flour to Begin Selling Tomorrow

The fourth phase of the Relief Administration's affordable flour sale has been scheduled to begin on the 17th. Every large cake stall, American cake stall, cut noodle shop, and steamed bun shop in this city will be allocated ten bags of flour, and the price will still be 1,900 yuan per bag (including the bag deposit fee of 200 yuan). The empty cloth bags must be returned in full before the fifth phase of the sale, otherwise the right to be allocated in the future will be cancelled.

Payment and Delivery Will Be Handled by District To reduce trouble and abuses, the General Administration will handle payment and delivery by district this time. Those who have already received the flour purchase certificate should pay attention to the number on the flour purchase certificate and go to the designated Shanghai Bank Zhongfu Bank Credit to receive the flour. The flour purchase certificate is green in the Huxi District, light cyan in the Central District, red in the Yangshupu Hongkou District, blue in the French Concession to Xujiahui and Huazhen, yellow in the Nanshi to Gaochang Temple area, light brown in the Zhabei Jiangwan District, and light red in the Pudong area. If there are those who have registered but have not been issued a flour purchase certificate, they are currently under investigation. Once the investigation is confirmed, the flour purchase certificate will be issued immediately, and the payment and delivery will be made to the designated bank with the certificate, and there is no time limit.

A Large Amount of Flour Will Be Released The first, second, and third phases of the affordable flour sale, the wholesale price also includes the bag deposit fee of 200 yuan. The General Administration has recently ordered all sellers to return the flour bags to the Fuxin and Fufeng Office in Renji Road Zhongfu Bank before the 31st of this month and receive the deposit back. Otherwise, it will not be accepted. The Finance Department of the General Administration has decided to release a large amount of flour in this city to meet the needs of the market and balance the price of flour in this city. Those who need to purchase it can purchase the flour at the price from the Fuxin and Fufeng offices at any time.

Fourth Phase of Sugar Price Revised The fourth phase of the enemy and puppet property disposal food affordable sale is about to begin. Each person is limited to purchasing one city catty, and the price is revised to 440 yuan per city catty, including the packaging fee. In addition, the Sugar Industry Association is entrusted to publicly sell 4,000 bags in order to suppress the sugar price. The meat, beef, and pork will continue to be sold at an affordable price, and the price will remain the same. Each person is still limited to purchasing five city catties of salted meat, 40 city catties of beef, and ten city catties of pork. The bureau will also entrust 5,000 boxes of Huangxiangmao soap to 1,000 Class A members of the Tobacco Exchange Association to start selling at an affordable price, with each box priced at 7,500 yuan. 63 tons of calcium carbide will be entrusted to the Japanese-China Oxygen Co., Ltd. and China Industrial Gas Co., Ltd., which are taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, to start directly distributing to oxygen purchasing households and other industrial users at an affordable price.

### French Business Shashadian Workers Began Slowdown Yesterday Morning

[Report from this newspaper] From 8:40 AM yesterday morning, all employees of the French Business Water and Electricity Company implemented a general slowdown. At the same time, French Business trams and buses stopped selling tickets, but still drove as usual.

Five Requirements Proposed The reporter specially visited the company's labor union and learned that the slowdown was caused by the company's reply yesterday, which was unwilling to consider the employees' written requirements. The requirements can be divided into five items: (1) The salary in December of last year cannot be less than that in November, (2) The company once promised to consider the year-end bonus issue after adjusting the ticket price, but has not yet implemented it, (3) Adjustment of state base salary, (4) Assisting in the establishment of a labor union, (5) Abolishing the contracting system to protect veteran workers, etc. A labor representative once told this newspaper reporter, "Our slowdown does not affect public order, and we still take care of the public's transportation. Office staff also work as usual, and the water and electricity supply is as usual. If a reasonable solution cannot be obtained, we will continue to do so." As of the time of writing, it is still in a slowdown state.

Before the victory, Du Kelesituo, the general manager of the French Business Water and Electricity Company, had flattered the Japanese and presented the Japanese army with 15 buses, five large engines, gasoline and diesel tires, etc. The company's employees are now collecting various evidence to prepare to report it.

Year-End Bonus for Telephone Employees Resolved Liang Yongzhang, a representative of the Telephone Company Labor Union, told reporters yesterday that the company's request has been responded to by the company, stipulating that employees who have worked for more than five years will receive a month's salary as a year-end bonus, those who have worked for less than five years will receive half a month, and those who have worked for less than one year will receive one-twenty-fourth of a month's salary. The subsidy from December is 5,670 yuan. If there is less issued before, the company will allow it to be made up on the 23rd of this month. After the company's employees met last night, they were willing to accept it. As for the adjustment of the base salary and the same salary for the same level, the discussion will be reserved for later. It is also known that the Shanghai Telephone Company is also affiliated to the US headquarters. It has telegraphed to express sympathy for the strike of US telephone workers.

Six Major Companies Request a Salary Increase The labor unrest in major public utilities in this city has been frequent. This trend has also extended to the six major companies on Nanjing Road. The monthly salary of the employees of these companies is only 8,600 yuan. They are now demanding that the minimum salary should be 35,000 yuan. This request was made on the 12th, and as of yesterday, a sincere response from the virtuous party has not yet been obtained. They jointly requested the mediation of the Municipal Party Committee.

### Female Workers at Four Cotton Mills Strike Yesterday Afternoon

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, female workers from four mills in the city, including the Third Factory of the Wing On Cotton Mill, the Hongzhang Textile Factory, the Ninth Factory of the Shenxin Cotton Mill, and the Xinyu Cotton Mill, totaling more than 4,700 people, went on strike due to unmet demands for increased wages, year-end bonuses (50,000 yuan uniformly for both new and old employees), and the free distribution of half a bolt of cotton cloth per person. The Social Affairs Bureau received the news at 3:00 PM and immediately dispatched Zhu Guilin to mediate between labor and management. Simultaneously, the city's Party Headquarters also sent Fang Rusheng to attend. However, the efforts were stalled because the labor side could not produce formal representatives. The authorities are now willing to seek a solution within the scope of state-run cotton mill compensation to prevent the labor unrest from escalating.

### Overseas Vietnamese Issue Declaration to Break Away from French Rule

Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the United Committee of Overseas Vietnamese in Shanghai held a general assembly. In addition to the more than 700 Vietnamese soldiers and 500 Vietnamese police officers stationed in the city, most overseas Vietnamese residents in Shanghai also participated.

A Committee member of the Overseas Vietnamese read the official English Declaration of Independence from French rule. This was followed by speeches from reporters from various newspapers, wishing the Vietnamese independence movement success.

### High Court Criminal Division Continues Hearing Traitor Cases; Gan Deyun Arrested After Being Reported by the British Navy

The traitor Gan Deyun, also known as Gan Weilu, is 62 years old, a native of Chaozhou, Guangdong, and resides at 17 Panlong Street, Zhapu Road. His father was British, named Gan Wei-luo-pai-te, and his mother was Cantonese. He naturalized as a Chinese citizen in 1926. He obtained a lawyer's license from the Ministry of Justice of the National Government and joined the Lawyers Association in 1936 to practice law. In the spring of 1940, through Wen Shu-ni, he met Chen Gongbo and joined the puppet organization, serving as a member of the puppet Legislative Yuan. He resigned at the end of 1942, continuing to practice law. He founded the publication "The Voice of New China," advocating for the expulsion of Britain and the United States. After the victory, he was reported by the British Navy's Shanghai Office to the Municipal Police Bureau, arrested, and transferred to the court. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, presiding judge Zhu Zonghai of the High Court Criminal Division opened an investigation court to hear the case.

(Question) You are also British, why did the British Navy report you? (Answer) Twenty years ago, I wrote an essay strongly criticizing Britain's policy in China and presented a photograph personally inscribed by Chairman Chiang. It was inscribed to me because I helped with the recovery of the British Concession in Jiujiang in 1926.

Witness Explains Spreading Leaflets

Xu Lianyang, who claimed to be Gan's secretary and printed leaflets, testified that Gan did order him to do so and proved that Gan published "The Voice of New China," encouraged China to reclaim extraterritorial rights, and was committed to opposing Britain's expansion of Chinese sovereignty.

Lin and Wu's Cases Rescheduled for Retrial: At the same time, the traitor Lin Meicun was also interrogated yesterday. Lin, alias Shen Jianren, is 50 years old. Judge Zhu asked him when he served as a puppet inspector, chief of the Narcotics Bureau Investigation Brigade, and director of the Wujiang Collection Office, and how he used his power to exploit the people. The defendant did not confess truthfully, only admitting to serving as a collector in the Wujiang Collection Office of the Su-Wu District Office and claiming that Lü Xiubai falsely accused him due to failed blackmail. The court adjourned for investigation and retrial.

[Report from our newspaper] The Xinhua Shipping Company's Fuxing motor sailing vessel, which departed for Taiwan on the 6th, encountered an accident near Keelung on the 10th, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. The Fuxing was a 330-ton vessel, originally built by the Japanese Navy. Before completion, Japan surrendered, and the vessel was taken over by our Navy Department. The Navy Department then offered it for sale, and it was purchased by Xinhua Shipping Company through bidding. Subsequently, Taixi Shipping Company at 110 Sichuan Road leased it to operate to Taiwan. On the 6th, it departed from Shanghai for Taiwan carrying 219 tons of cargo, including 2,000 bags of flour and over 5,000 soybean cakes. On the 10th, it arrived near Keelung and was about to enter the port when it was struck by a strong wind and ran aground and sank in the Tamsui waters. The captain, Zhang Meibin, immediately sent a telegram for help. Fortunately, it was near the port, and various ships rescued some of the crew members who reached Taipei. However, after the ship's accident, the company had not heard anything until the Taiwan Provincial Government's Shanghai Liaison Office received a telegram from the Taiwan Secretariat inquiring about the passenger and cargo situation. The company then learned of the accident and yesterday reported the tonnage of the cargo and the details of the 27 crew members. It is also learned that the vessel was a cargo ship and did not have passenger berths, so it did not carry passengers.

### Reborn from a Cruel World

— Our reporter to Suren

Why does everyone pay attention to Hui Zhu? Because she is young, beautiful, affectionate, and has committed suicide. However, these are all things of the past. Now Yan Xuanzhu is "Willow leaves are not drawn for a long time," she converted to Catholicism, and said that only God's grace can save her and make her suddenly have a sense of belonging. Forget the past, be a new person, devote herself to drama, and embark on the path of true life.

Following Mr. Mei's careful study of art For friends who care about her, she expressed her heartfelt thanks; for those who abuse attacks, she hopes to have facts to prove them in the future. Dao said that the biggest reason for coming to Shanghai this time is to prepare to follow Mr. Mei Lanfang for a long time and accept Mr. Mei's artistic teachings. Because Mr. Mei has passed the age of fifty and will not have many opportunities for her to observe, he should meet Mr. Mei every day to ask for advice and watch every scene.

Social ruthlessness prompted her to become world-weary: The reporter met Ms. Yan and she told me these words. Then, she narrated the reasons and process of her suicide in an extremely frank manner, which was the same as Mian's suicide note. The biggest reason for her world-weariness was that she felt the coldness of the world and the ruthlessness of society. Various rumors are certainly caused by something, but she thinks that there is no need to make a fuss about a normal social interaction. A female performer is also an ordinary person with flesh and blood and emotions. She needs friends and the comfort of love like others. She believes that she has this right and admits that she is considering marriage. She said that marriage does not conflict with career.

The white cap of the nurse gave her inspiration: At three o'clock in the middle of the night on November 8 last year, in the former capital, a woman quietly swallowed a large number of sleeping pills, without tears, without pain, she asked for a release, like every smart person asked. It was not until twenty-seven hours later that she regained consciousness, heard familiar voices, and saw the morning light of the clear morning. But she did not give up the idea of leaving the world. Her heavy and weak limbs made it impossible to end her life. She wanted to go on a hunger strike, but the doctor told her: Injections can also prolong life. Just when she was at a loss, the white hat of the female nurse in the German hospital gave her the light and courage of life. She thought that others were working busily, serving for faith and for the people, why couldn't she do this? She can also be active. With this inspiration, a woman who was about to fall into hell converted to the Lord and was baptized with great sincerity, doing Mass every morning and evening. In this way, she gradually calmed down her moving heart. She was saved, she was reborn.

Reforming Pingju and working hard to move forward Now, religion and art are her two pillars. The former only requires sincerity and persistence, while the latter also depends on her own initiative. She said that the dance surface of Pingju must reform the color of big red and big green, and the arbitrary movement of the viewers is enough to distract the audience's attention. As for the original essence, such as singing, posture, and all symbolic techniques, should be preserved so that Pingju can show the full oriental color. She said that Mr. Mei has almost completed these points. She herself has recently performed "Xi Shi's Rebuilding the Country" in Beijing, and she has done her best to improve in this regard.

Madam Chiang's letter is earnest and sincere: At the end of last year, President Chiang visited Ping, and she once wrote a letter to defend herself, because the Commercial Daily had published that she had dealings with the enemy and puppets. Later, the newspaper was reorganized. She also wrote a long letter to Madam Chiang, mentioning women's issues. Half a month later, a reply came, expressing sympathy for the ground and encouraging her to live bravely.

Conflicting psychology creates misfortune In the quiet corner of the D.D.S. cafe, during a two-hour conversation, I could feel that a woman who had been through a lot of hardships had an extremely conflicting psychology. In the past, she sometimes wanted to go up, but unconsciously, she made a net and dragged herself back in again. As the saying goes: "Reflexively being smart", Yan Pingzhu is such an unfortunate woman.

### Qian Dajun Encourages Students from Various Schools to Accumulate Talent and Dedicate it to the Country: Demonstrations and Protests Must Obtain Permission

Shanghai Mayor and Commander-in-Chief of the Songhu Garrison Command Qian Dajun issued a statement on the recent demonstrations and protests in the city, stating: "Several demonstrations and protests have occurred in the city recently, none of which have been approved by the Songhu Garrison Command, and they were held without authorization, which is very inappropriate. The city is still under martial law, and according to the provisions of the Martial Law Act, such actions are prohibited without the approval of the Martial Law Commander.

Should be prohibited, but considering that the participants this time are, The actions are not too excessive, and they may not be fully aware of the martial law orders, there is no understanding, so it was not forcibly stopped. Huai Ci is only a special case, and should not be considered a normal practice or imitated. In the future, if there are demonstrations, you must submit an application for approval in advance in accordance with the regulations. If the demonstrations are approved, the Garrison Command will be responsible for ensuring their safety. If you take action without permission, it will not only violate the law, but also It may cause accidents, I hope all sectors pay close attention and try to avoid it. It is also important to note that the majority of the participants in this gathering and march are students. Students are the future foundation of the country and should pursue learning as the primary goal. The eight-year war of resistance, the relocation of schools, and the lack of equipment

The lack of equipment has had a huge impact on students' studies. Now that the war has come to an end, the schools are gradually returning to normal. Students from all schools should take this opportunity to work harder to make up for the past and encourage the future. Moreover, our country is now in a great era of national construction and needs a large number of specialists. Students must also encourage themselves to study hard and contribute to the country. Parents and teachers of all students are responsible for teaching their children and cultivating young people. They must repeatedly explain this meaning and teach them earnestly so that young people can accumulate talent and contribute to the country, which is what we hope. At the cocktail party, Mr. Patterson shook hands warmly with the citizens of Qian

### A Trip to the Cemetery to See the Flowers

— Tang Liyan

The cemetery used to be a place for the people of the city to relax and enjoy themselves. After the enemy invasion, the flowers, trees, pavilions, and terraces were almost completely destroyed. Three years ago, the poet Tang Liyan went to Beijing to pay his respects and wrote a piece called "A Trip to the Cemetery to See the Flowers," which was in the spirit of Du Fu's "Lament by the River." Now that the enemy has been driven out and the country rebuilt, when the hibiscus flowers bloom again, he revisits the old place. What will his feelings be?

—Editor's Note

In the third month of Jiangnan, spring is like a sea,
Countless flowers sway in the breeze.
After three years, I revisit Moling,
The scenery is unchanged, though the river has been altered.
I remember when the flowers in the cemetery were at their best,
Willows with green foliage were mixed with spring grass.
I met you with a smile in a carriage on the road,
Whose young lady dropped her whip, leaving a jade ornament?
Whose young gentleman is so charming,
The emperor's son has no worries, Lady Mo Chou has no sorrow.
Every night, songs of "Jade Tree" are sung in the back courtyard,
Every morning, the Cold Food Festival is a spring outing.
The women of Wu and Yue have faces like jade,
Their curved bodies bring spring to life, charmingly adorned.
Walking among the flowers, I see no one,
People are like flowers, never tiring of looking.
Among them are several relatives of imperial concubines,
With bright earrings and emerald feathers, even more outstanding.
Their embroidered shoes and silk stockings are worth a thousand gold,
The five colors are dazzling, gathering like clouds.
One day, the barbarian cavalry filled the land,
The nine-layered city produced smoke and dust.
The country was overthrown because of the beauty of three women,
The flowers that bloom are all that remain of the Six Dynasties' spring.
Everything is like this, following the turning candle,
The chess game is repeatedly overturned.
Li Bai sings "The Road to Shu is Difficult,"
Du Fu, the old man of Duling, swallows his tears and cries!
Returning like a crane, I stop at the country's gate,
The wind and rain of Maoling want to turn to dusk.
Spring is growing old on Le You Yuan,
Plum blossoms have fallen, and cherry blossoms are flourishing.
Alas! Though the cherry blossoms flourish, they also fade quickly,
We will see tomorrow that the wind and rain will be terrible.

### The Victory that Dazzled Her

— Mang Di

Many, many self-examinations, or opinions, complaints, and even urgings, are constantly modifying and restraining her new demeanor—victory.

It's as if she had just put down the wooden bucket for milking cows—that inferior thing—and was invited into a magnificent hall of the upper class. She felt excited wearing such a gorgeous dress, adorned with such beautiful red flowers, and standing among these esteemed people. Perhaps she simply couldn't contain herself. Then, she felt someone was watching her.

Jealousy? Contempt? But it certainly wasn't a look of kindly praise! So she examined herself, restrained herself, and began to feel that her footsteps were too heavy; no, that her shoes were too tight; her skin too rough; her teeth too black; or even that her body was too short... She whispered, as if scolding her reckless younger brother in front of relatives: Be careful! Be cautious! Don't be so unrefined and lose face!

But she felt constrained! She really couldn't learn their way of walking—so generous and leisurely—perhaps because she couldn't exchange these too-tight shoes? She secretly massaged her face and the back of her hands, but it hurt and didn't remove the rough skin! Impossible! Ashamed! Everything...! She began to angrily and dejectedly complain about herself, cursing herself, but she seemed unwilling to take off and hide the glorious gains—the dress, the red flowers, the status—and pick up the wooden bucket for milking cows—that inferior old companion—to strive for her success and future. She no longer trusted that in this inferior, old company, she could find new, real success. She didn't understand the distance and interests between her and those esteemed people, and she was obsessed and dazzled by this new demeanor. She thought that such fashionable adornments would only allow her to aimlessly wander among those esteemed people, but that was always better than the effort from that inferior, arduous, old life.

She really disagreed: Before one has real success like those esteemed people, there's no need for empty restraint, modification, and cursing. One should stand on one's own ground and continue the efforts, whether old or new, that one can do for oneself. She was really obsessed and dazzled by the new demeanor—victory!

### Winter Night

— Qian Cao

Tonight, I heard the call of the wilderness, and my heart began to feel restless. Although we all have passionate hearts, filled with the flames of love, who can understand whose heart?

People need to be honest with each other. But when a naked stranger stands before you, takes off his mask, you will surely find him hideous, even say that he is inhumane.

In fact, I also know that honesty is precious.

Then let me honestly tell you: I want to tie tonight's moon and tomorrow's sun together with a long rope.

However, tonight's moon? Tomorrow's sun? This is simply a dream.

Tonight, even the moon's shadow is imprisoned, so what else can be said?

In the frosty night, the sky is very heavy. Walking on the deserted street, I feel infinite desolation. Alas, why don't I go back? What am I doing wandering the streets?

The frost of winter nights will freeze my heart.

The winter night sky will not have blue lyricism.

I returned from wandering the streets, bringing back infinite coldness, making me tremble, making me feel desolate.

Tonight, my pillow is soaked. Ah, am I really crying?

I have never shed tears easily, just as I don't cherish my feelings. I often sacrifice my feelings unconditionally and without value, and what I get in return is only some ethereal poetry.

But tonight I shed tears because I couldn't suppress the impulse of my emotions.

I didn't dare to cry out loud, I just buried my head in the quilt and sobbed. I didn't want anyone to find me crying.

Why bother? My heart is already broken. Why deceive others' tears with my own sadness? Every tear has its price.

### I Returned Empty-Handed

— Xiao Meng

I returned empty-handed, still wearing the tattered gown I had when I left home; a gust of wind blew it, making it dance like a butterfly. Looking again at the scar on my leg, the mark from the battle at X Mountain. With a mocking tone, it also looked directly at me. I felt bottomless bitterness... Thousands of faces, familiar faces. Following me, mocking me, ridiculing me. Making me unable to lift my head.

"Idiot. Hah! Such a stubborn spirit, doesn't being an official mean getting rich?" I remember the nickname the pointy-headed special agent gave me behind my back—"Yu Zi" (Stubborn).

Yes, I am a stubborn one, a small stone in the stream that refuses to go with the flow, with many thorns and angles. But I remain calm in the face of these insignificant cold barbs and hot sarcasm. On the contrary, my few heartfelt words when I said goodbye to my subordinates brought tears to my dry eyes. This was perhaps the first time in my life that I was truly saddened? Tears flowing from the bottom of my heart!

"Comrades: Open our weak eyes and look! Is the motherland healthy? The so-called celebrities and big shots who know how to get ahead and cheat have deceived the world. Yet they sit high on the throne as great heroes and big shots. China, China..." I shed tears for my own painful, trembling tone. The brothers were also moved to tears, silently, the sound of tears and hearts intertwined.

This was what I said to my brothers when I asked for a long leave and it was approved, before we parted. I shed hot tears, wetting my clothes. Go, go! Shameful and despicable tears, take back these bitter tears. Now I will never cry again—I am a traitor.

Now I return empty-handed, still wearing the tattered gown I had when I left home; a gust of wind rises...

Pen Under Heaven

### "Officials" and "People"

— Xie Dongping

The bureaucratic politics of China for thousands of years have clearly divided officials and the people into two separate lines. Officials are a class, the so-called scholar-official class. Officials can always be officials, and they can be rich generation after generation. Officials not only govern the people but are also always above the people. I really hate the nice-sounding term "scholarly family." In reality, the so-called "scholarly family" is just a big family that talks about formality, hypocrisy, superficial rituals, and a strong official air.

If the bureaucratic system is not broken, any talk of democracy is empty. The so-called "returning power to the people," this return just returns the power to the officials. Therefore, it doesn't matter whether it's returned or not.

In Chinese society, officials have always led the lives of the people. On the one hand, officials seem to be setting an example, and on the other hand, they enjoy special rights and interests. As the saying goes, "The magistrate is allowed to set fires, but the common people are not allowed to light lamps." This "setting fires" is the special right and interest of officials. You cannot light lamps because you are not an official but a commoner.

Now that times are different, this situation should be reversed. The so-called reversal is not "commoners are allowed to set fires, but the magistrate is not allowed to light lamps," but rather the leadership of officials by the people should be transformed into the leadership of officials by the people. The people ask the officials to do things, but the officials must listen to the people.

In Chinese society, it's infuriating to say, ordinary people are not qualified to speak. If you say something, those official-minded people will ask you, "What qualifications do you have to say these things?" In fact, his qualifications are the highest. He is a commoner. He can control the officials. He has the right to say anything to the officials.

If the people really lead the officials, and the officials no longer have any special rights and interests to enjoy, then those who are enthusiastic about being officials will no longer want to be officials. The position of official will be given to those who are enthusiastic about doing things. The status of the common people will be raised, and everyone will be willing to be a commoner. The world will be peaceful, and that will be the much-touted democracy.

### A Pair of Lovebirds (5)

— Zhao Qingge

Mrs. Mo was two years younger than Mr. Mo. She had considerable beauty, liked to dress up, and came from a noble family, so she was very particular about enjoying herself. Perhaps this was her shortcoming; because she couldn't endure hardship and couldn't be frugal with her life, she didn't have any savings.

Mrs. Mo met Mrs. Weng the Second in Beijing, and now they met again in Jingzhou. Mrs. Weng the Second's situation was similar to Mrs. Mo's. Mr. Weng married Mrs. Weng the Second in Beijing, and then sent her to Jingzhou. Mrs. Weng the Second was exactly the opposite of Mrs. Mo. Her character was as weak as rubber. You could knead her into any shape, and that's what she would be. But she was prettier than Mrs. Mo and could sing a few arias from Peking opera. It was said that Mr. Weng married her for these two advantages. But later, she got old, and Mr. Weng lost interest in her. Mrs. Mo sympathized with her situation, so they became good friends. Mrs. Weng the Second relied on Mrs. Mo to make decisions for her in many things. Although some people advised Mrs. Mo not to get too close to Mrs. Weng the Second because of her somewhat improper background, Mrs. Mo didn't listen. Mrs. Mo thought that the more proper a person was, the more improper things they would do. So Mrs. Mo stubbornly sympathized with Mrs. Weng the Second and helped her. They were inseparable every day. Later, Mrs. Weng the Second simply moved into Mrs. Mo's house. This went on for four years until Mr. Weng and Mr. Mo returned from Beijing, and then they separated.

Mr. Mo and Mrs. Mo lived separately in the north and south, each trying to find pleasure and enjoyment as much as possible. Neither of them invested in property, so when the end came, they were all very poor!

The last days of the Qing Dynasty finally arrived! The Revolutionary Party swept away the imperial family in Beijing and established the Republic of China. All the wealthy officials of the Manchu banner people were turned into commoners. It was at this time that Mr. Mo, along with Mr. Weng and Mo Sheng, the old servant who had served him for more than ten years, fled to Jingzhou in a panic and surrendered to the ladies.

With this, Mrs. Mo became even more lively and tried her best to torment Mr. Mo. She wanted to retaliate against him for the ways he had wronged her in the past. She not only did this herself but also taught Mrs. Weng the Second to do the same. These two gentlemen became prisoners of the two ladies, and these two prisoners sympathized with each other and became good friends.

For the first half of the year, they were still able to get by. In the second half of the year, they had to rely on the thirty or so piculs of rice harvested from the few dozen mu of land that Mrs. Mo bought to support the family. Not to mention not being able to eat bird's nest and white fungus for breakfast, even Western food gradually became vegetarian. When Mrs. Mo was craving something, she would invite Mrs. Weng the Second to go to a small restaurant to nourish herself. Or she would buy some fish or meat, and the two of them would hide in the room and enjoy it secretly. The two gentlemen didn't get any, and they didn't dare to express any opinion.

Mrs. Mo also assigned Mr. Mo a job, which was to teach their precious son, Baoling, to read. In this way, Mrs. Mo saved the cost of hiring a teacher, and Mr. Mo didn't feel like he was being supported for nothing. In fact, Mr. Mo himself didn't want to sit at home and do nothing, but he didn't have the opportunity to work. He couldn't be an official again, and he couldn't live the way he used to.

Baoling was already nine years old at this time. He was very smart and had seen some of the estrangement between his parents, so he often used innocent actions to try to mediate their atmosphere and ease their feelings. But it was useless. Mrs. Mo was unmoved and didn't forgive Mr. Mo at all. She didn't let Baoling call him "father" and told Baoling that Mrs. Weng the Second was his "father."

### Small Office Workers Have a Hard Time Getting Around, Asking for Free Tram Rides, Because the Round Trip Fare is Too High

Dear Editor: I have long admired you as the voice of the people, dedicated to serving society. The public has benefited a lot from your help. I have an opinion that I would like you to appeal for. The reason is that there are so many banknotes circulating on the market now, with counterfeit money piled up, and legal tender still in large stacks. Using it is really like throwing money away, making poor scholars unable to use it and feeling a little envious. Take the small office worker of the salaried class as an example. The monthly salary is very small. After calculating, you first have to pay rent, then buy rice, then buy firewood, and buy vegetables. A small family of three or four people already feels stretched to make ends meet with the seven necessities of life. Expenses for clothing and entertainment are simply out of the question. As for social engagements, of course, they cannot be included in the calculation, but they are often needed. The even bigger problem is that you must first take out a portion from this very meager salary as tram fare, to get from home to the office every day. Before, when the fare was small, the round-trip fare was already painful to pay. You must know that these people are not in the ranks of department heads, and there will be no cars to pick them up. They must also arrive at the office on time to sign in, so they have to take the tram. Now that the tram fare has been increased, the authorities, in order to be considerate of business difficulties and avoid labor unrest, have allowed them to increase the price, but they have neglected the small office workers who don't have the fare. If they rely entirely on running with two legs, how can they get to the office on time? I saw an author in a certain newspaper talking about "hoping to give preferential treatment to students taking the tram." That's right, there are many poor students who should ride the tram for free, but small office workers in various agencies must also receive the preferential treatment of riding the tram for free. The authorities should sympathize with this and issue an official document. Businesses will not refuse to accept it. But what is this little bit of income worth to businesses! Once it can be realized, a group of small office workers will all be convenient and everyone will benefit, and they will inevitably sing praises of virtue all the time. Respectfully wishing you good health, Zhou Jun, a reader.

### Inquiry About Relief for Students Who Have Lost Their Schooling

Editor Gusheng: As I live in a remote place with limited access to information, I am unaware of the organizations currently providing assistance to young students who have been displaced from their schooling.
