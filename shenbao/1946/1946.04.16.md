### The Situation in Changchun is Extremely Tense; Communist Troops Attack the City from Multiple Directions; Nationalist Troops Moving Northward Stationed in Siping Street

[This Newspaper's Beiping Dispatch on the 15th] The situation in Changchun has become extremely tense. This morning, the Air Force received a telegram from Changchun stating that the Air Force ground personnel at Changchun Airport lost contact with personnel in the city from the morning of the 15th. It is possible that the airport has been captured by Communist troops. Nationalist troops moving north from Shenyang have now reached the vicinity of Siping Street, and Communist troops are attempting to prevent the Nationalist troops from advancing north. Siping Street is approximately sixty-odd kilometers north of Changchun.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10:00 AM, 15th] Changchun is currently under heavy siege by Communist troops. Fighting has continued unabated throughout the night, with the sounds of gunfire as dense as a string of pearls. Communist troops have attacked the city from multiple directions, and the situation is extremely critical. The reporter's telegraphic work has been hampered. All sides are eagerly awaiting reinforcements.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 15th] According to reports, the advance troops of the Nationalist forces moving north to take over defense entered Siping Street at 10:00 AM on the 15th. Communist troops in both the old Siping Street and Bamian City fled northwards in disarray. Furthermore, according to sources in the transportation sector, the Yujin section of the railway, which was damaged, has not been open to traffic for over a week. Recently, under the protection of Nationalist troops, engineering teams have worked day and night to complete repairs, and the line can be opened to traffic on the 15th. Passenger trains will also resume service.

[United Press, Changchun, 15th] The battle for Changchun is already underway. After Communist troops occupied three airfields outside the city, they have pressed closer to the urban area. Nationalist defense commander Major General Chen Jiazhen is currently retaining his main force to defend the central district. This area is densely fortified with long trenches, barbed wire, obstacles, and gun emplacements constructed from earth and stone. The Nationalist headquarters is located in the Central Bank Building. Many other buildings are also piled high with sandbags. Communist troops are currently attacking the train station from the north. A Nationalist armored train is traveling back and forth, firing at the Communist troops. The weapons being used in the fighting include rifles, machine guns, direct-fire cannons, hand grenades, and mortars. The Communist forces also have artillery to assist in the battle. It is reported that the Communist troops are commanded by generals from the New Fourth Army, utilizing Japanese weapons in their combat. The Nationalist side believes that these Japanese weapons were transferred to the Communist troops by the Soviet army several months ago.

### The Trial of the Traitor Chu Minyi Has Concluded; Sentencing on the Afternoon of the 22nd; After Several Hours of Defense, He Voluntarily Chooses Death

The Jiangsu High Court convened the trial of Chu Minyi on the afternoon of the 15th at 2:25 PM, with Court President Sun Hong still serving as the presiding judge, Criminal Court President Shi Meiyu as the chief judge, and Judge Lu Jiarui also present. The chief prosecutor was Han Jun, and the clerk was Qin Dali. The traitor Chu was escorted to the court at 2:20 PM in the horse-drawn carriage he has always advocated in his life. After questioning his age and place of origin, Chu read aloud his lengthy and tedious defense statement for nearly three hours. At 5:05 PM, the court adjourned for a ten-minute recess. After questioning, it was announced that the investigation of evidence was completed. Chief Prosecutor Han Jun rose to make his prosecution speech, followed by a debate between Chu and Gao Rong, the public defender of the High Court. At 7:15 PM, the court announced the conclusion of the debate, and the sentencing was scheduled for 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 22nd of this month. Chu was then escorted back to prison. On the 15th, the spectator seats in the courtroom were still extremely crowded, no less than during the trial of Chen Gongbo. A total of 385 spectator passes were issued, but the number of spectators exceeded this by far, and those who arrived late had almost no place to stand. At the opening of the court, Clerk Qin stood up and announced: "Today, we are hearing the case of the traitor Chu Minyi." When the court asked about his age and place of origin, the traitor Chu stated that he was 64 years old, from Wuxing, Zhejiang. He had been away from his hometown for many years and resided at 21 Xikang Road, Nanjing. When the court asked about his occupation, he replied: "I came from a scholarly background and studied in France and Japan, earning a doctorate in medicine. After returning to China, I served as a professor at Guangdong University, and as president in the 14th year of the Republic. In the 15th year of the Republic, during the Northern Expedition, I served as the Director of Logistics for the Revolutionary Army. Before the Incident, I was engaged in education, medicine, and party affairs. My family includes [blank character] and three sons and two daughters." When the court asked about his property, he replied: "It is very regrettable, I only have a house at 34 Yihe Road, Nanjing, which was built before the war. I have no property in Shanghai."

The Prosecutor's Accusations

Then, Han announced the prosecutor's accusations, stating in brief: "The defendant joined the Nationalist Party very early and held important positions such as Central Executive Committee member and Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan. However, in the 27th year of the Republic, when the traitor Wang Zhaoming conspired with Japanese bandits for peace talks, he traveled between Nanjing and Shanghai, conspiring with them. He conspired with the Maintenance and Provisional puppet organizations to form a puppet government, which was finally established in March of the 29th year. Wang served as the puppet chairman and concurrently the president of the Executive Yuan, with the defendant assisting him, also serving as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He accompanied the traitor Chen Gongbo to Japan to express gratitude, and also signed the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty with the Japanese and issued the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration, humiliating the country and forfeiting its sovereignty, recognizing the puppet Manchukuo, and betraying the four northeastern provinces. He also served as the puppet ambassador to Japan, contacting various countries, and the puppet government obtained recognition from nine countries, including Germany and Italy. He returned to China in September of the 30th year and continued to serve as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, declaring war on the Allied nations of Britain and the United States. The defendant made every effort to have various countries recognize the puppet government, in effect regarding it as a formal government, which was no different from opposing the central government, and his declaration of war on the Allied nations was in effect no different from declaring war on the central government. In October of the 32nd year, he re-signed the Alliance Treaty with Japan, and in November, he accompanied the traitor Wang to participate in the Greater East Asia Conference, colluding with enemy countries and plotting to resist our own country. His crimes are extremely evident. Furthermore, during his tenure as Vice President of the Executive Yuan, he allowed the enemy to establish the North China Revitalization Company and the Central China Revitalization Company in its occupied areas, and established fifteen branch companies under them. Administration, transportation, food, and minerals were all under enemy control and at their disposal. During his tenure as the Governor of Guangdong Province, he conspired with Matsui, the liaison officer of the enemy, to increase the Guangdong customs tax by 80 million, with half going to the enemy and half going to the province, which further exacerbated his crimes of aiding the enemy. Therefore, he should be tried according to the law."

The Traitor Chu's Defense

Presiding Judge Sun then ordered the traitor Chu to respond, and Chu immediately put on his tortoiseshell spectacles and spread out his defense statement. However, this document was extremely fragmented and trivial, with many points that were irrelevant to the case. In brief: "(1) Although he and Wang were relatives, they were classmates when studying in France. After joining the Tongmenghui, they were comrades. He studied under the traitor Wang, and after taking office, Wang was his superior and he was his subordinate. Therefore, the depth of their relationship was more than just because of kinship, and he deeply admired Wang's character. (2) Before the Incident, he devoted himself to party affairs, education, and medicine, and was not affected by political forces. When he was in France, Wu Jingheng and others loved and cherished him very much and advised him not to engage in politics, but to establish a Chinese-French National Industrial Specialized School, and later he served as the principal of that school. Before the January 28th Incident, Jiang and Wang were sometimes united and sometimes divided, such as the Zhongshan Warship Incident, the Ninghan split, the Expanded Conference, and the Extraordinary Conference, he did not participate in any of them. In the 21st year, when Wang served as the President of the Executive Yuan, Zeng Zhongming wanted to transfer to become the Director of the Railway Department, so he succeeded him as the Secretary-General. In December of the 22nd year, Wang was assassinated and resigned, and he also left. In the 25th year, he served as the Deputy Director of the National Congress Representative Election Office (the Director was Jiang Zuobin). In the 27th year, he went to Hankou and Chongqing twice, both times to raise funds for the Chinese-French School, which had nothing to do with politics. Wang and Yingzuo and Imai, he did not know about the secret agreements. (3) Wang went to Nanjing and Qingdao twice to organize the Maintenance and Provisional puppet organizations. He was just one of the staff members. The conditions for peace and the establishment of the government were all Wang's proposals. He only heard about them. The establishment of the Nanjing government was two years and four months after the fall of Nanjing. During this period, the people had suffered extremely. The establishment of the government could allow the people to suffer less from direct Japanese rule. Wang advocated negotiating with Chongqing because he believed that resistance was to save the country, but peace was also to save the country. After reading Yandian, he suspected that this was a division of labor (Mr. Jiang is martial and Mr. Wang is literary). He once participated in the peace movement (a book was sent to the court). Wang believed that resistance had already begun and was easy to maintain, while peace was not easy. He told Mr. Jiang, 'You do the easy thing, I do the difficult thing,' and he firmly believed that different paths would inevitably lead to the same destination. Wang's organization of the government also restored the party organization, which indicated that he had not betrayed the party or the country. The year and the national title were the same, unlike the Maintenance and Provisional government, which established separate names. The yellow cloth strip on the national flag was also removed after Wang came. Therefore, Nanjing was actually indirectly resisting Japan, indirectly resisting Japan, and peacefully resisting Japan. (4) After he signed the treaty with Japan, the sovereignty and land did not decrease as a result, so it cannot be called humiliating the country and forfeiting its sovereignty. The name 'Alliance Treaty' is better than the 'Basic Treaty' in terms of wording, and he did not countersign these two treaties and is not responsible for signing them. He also did not sign the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration. Puppet Manchukuo was an established fact, and we had no choice but to endure the pain for a while to obtain Sino-Manchukuo relations and gradually try to recover it. (5) The declaration of war against Britain and the United States was issued by the National Government in Wang's own name, without the involvement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, because Britain and the United States did not have diplomatic relations with the puppet government. At this point, he praised the Sino-Japanese joint anti-communist proposal, saying that the abolition of joint anti-communism on May 4 of the 34th year was the main reason for Japan's failure. He considered that the recovery of concessions after the declaration of war against Britain and the United States was a 'joke.' The Axis countries' recognition of the puppet government was a trend of the times and not his doing alone. (6) During the enemy occupation, all departments were able to negotiate with the Japanese. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs only sent people to welcome and send off guests. In fact, it was a 'social department.' He engaged in social and cultural undertakings in his spare time, such as hygiene, music, and movies."

Voluntarily Accepting Punishment

He then boasted of his achievements, saying that he alone had come to the mausoleum to silently read the Premier's will and sing the party song alone. He also said that China and Japan are of the same race and culture and share the same Buddhist faith, so he had renovated temples and obtained the sarira of the Tang monk Xuanzang, and replaced an eleven-foot-tall Thousand-Hand Guanyin with a 33-foot-tall Guanyin carved from a single tree in Nagoya. "(7) He allowed the people in the occupied areas to continue party activities under Japanese rule, and he did not betray the party or the country. (8) The Central China and North China Revitalization Companies were recognized during the Maintenance and Provisional government periods and were not within his authority. The Guangdong tax increase of 80 million was fabricated by the court, and the confession was more harmful than being beaten. In fact, the crimes he committed were sufficient to warrant the death penalty. He asked the prosecutor not to add unfounded charges against him. He knew on the 13th that Chen Gongbo had been sentenced to death, 'and I will certainly be sentenced to death as well.' But he had received a telegram from the Chairman saying, 'He is guilty of joining the enemy, but considering that he has followed the Premier in the revolution for many years and maintained law and order in Guangdong after the Japanese surrender, he can be dealt with leniently.' Although it is difficult to distinguish between truth and falsehood, he voluntarily chose to die." At this point, he read out the addendum to his defense statement, titled "A Few Words for the General Peace Comrades," stating in brief: "There is a lack of talent at present. People are forced by livelihood, and the officials, large and small, who worked in the puppet government should be treated leniently." He also criticized the Military Intelligence Bureau for not having the legal authority to arrest people and for using deception when arresting them. He also criticized the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors in a pedantic manner and pointed out that the suffering of the people in the occupied areas of Chongqing was not as severe as the suffering of one-two-hundredth of the people after the victory. He concluded by saying, "I deserve to be punished and can follow Mr. Wang underground, leading those waiting for punishment, without any regrets." At this time, the court announced a brief recess. The court reopened at 5:25 PM. The presiding judge first presented the puppet appointment letter, the Guangdong Provincial Government meeting records, the joint statement, the records of the puppet National Government officials going to Japan to express gratitude, and Chu's "World Situation and East Asian Unity" to Chu for him to read and asked: "How many times have you been to Japan?" He replied, "In the 29th year of the Republic, I went to Japan with Chen Gongbo to express gratitude. I served as the ambassador to Japan in the 30th year. In that year, Wang visited Japan for the first time. I went twice in the spring and autumn of the 31st year. In the autumn, I accompanied Wang on his second visit to Japan. In the 32nd year, I went to the Greater East Asia Medical Conference. On November 5 of the same year, I went to Japan to attend the Greater East Asia Conference. In the 33rd year, I went to visit Wang when he was ill. Wang attended the Greater East Asia Conference, and I was in attendance." The court then played his broadcast recording "The Review and New Understanding of the September 18th Incident," which contained statements such as "Jiang Jieshi is stubborn and self-willed, harming the country and the people" and "Empty words deceive the people." Chu appeared very uneasy while listening and said, "I can hear that it is my voice." The court asked, "Did you go to Japan specifically to have the Axis countries recognize the puppet government?" He replied, "Yes." The court asked, "When were they recognized?" He replied, "It was the trend of the times and not my doing alone." The court asked, "Did Wang sign the treaty himself? Did you not handle it?" He replied, "I sometimes participated in the discussions." The court asked, "During your tenure as the Governor of Guangdong Province, did you ban opium?" He replied, "Yes. The Opium Prohibition Bureau was directly under the Opium Prohibition Supervisor. I assisted the special envoy of the Opium Prohibition Bureau and requested the airline in Shanghai to transport 30,000 taels of opium to Guangdong in June." The court asked, "It is good to ban opium, but why did you transport it in large quantities?" He replied, "Public sale." The court asked, "Then it is not banning opium, it is selling opium?" He replied, "Yes, it is prohibition through taxation, and it is the responsibility of the Opium Prohibition Supervisor, not the provincial government." The court said, "The telegrams were between you and Chen Gongbo?" He replied, "Only the economic aspects were related to the provincial government." The court asked, "Regarding the 80 million opium tax with Matsui, although you do not admit it, the records show a conversation with Matsui in which it was said, 'The tax revenue can be increased by 80 million, half of which will be submitted to the central government as a subsidy for the province, and half of which will subsidize the Japanese army.'" He replied, "There was such a discussion, but it was not implemented."

The Prosecutor's Accusation

The court then announced the completion of the evidence investigation. Chief Prosecutor Han rose to make his accusation, stating in brief: "(1) The defendant considered himself to be saving the country and the people, but Chongqing already had a central government. The establishment of the puppet government in Nanjing was actually adding to the suffering of the people. The puppet government not only did not relieve the suffering of the people, but also increased taxes and extorted money. (2) Peaceful resistance is a joke. To 'resist,' you need guns. Moreover, the puppet government repeatedly stated that it would share weal and woe and even live and die together. (3) Since the September 18th Incident, the country has never recognized that the Northeast has been lost and vowed to recover it. That is why there was resistance. The puppet government was the first to sign a treaty, recognizing that it was an ally with the enemy. Although Wang signed it, the defendant, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, cannot deny that he knew about it. (4) After the declaration of war against Britain and the United States, although he claimed that it was to remove extraterritoriality, has the puppet court ever tried a Japanese person? The recovery of the concessions has nothing to do with the defendant. (5) The defendant considers the return to the capital as a merit, but the return to the capital of Wang Zhaoming and a few other traitors is simply treason. (6) The defendant also knows about the harm caused by the Central China and North China Revitalization Companies. The tax increase of 80 million would have been implemented if the war had not ended. (7) The suffering of the people in the occupied areas is so deep. How can there be no legal sanctions? The defendant's claim that the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors cannot be applied is absurd. (8) The defendant criticizes the law improperly, but this seat can only accuse him according to the law and has no need to refute this point." At this point, the court ordered [blank character] to respond. [Blank character] stated in brief: "Resistance can be done orally or in writing and does not necessarily require guns." He claimed that it was very difficult to organize the puppet government and that there were too few talented people. Therefore, corruption and espionage were indeed facts. He also praised the Vichy government and Petain for enduring humiliation for the sake of the country.

Publishing the Defense Statement

At this point, the traitor Chu was exhausted and hoarse, and his words were fragmented. He claimed that he had violated Article 2, Paragraph 1, Clause 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors and asked the presiding judge to sentence him to death, saying that life imprisonment was too uneconomical. He concluded by saying that he had always supported peace and that he had not changed his mind to this day. The presiding judge then supplemented his question, "Did the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Declaration go through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs?" He replied, "It was handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The declaration of war against Britain and the United States did not go through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs." The court asked, "What about the Basic and Alliance treaties?" He replied, "They were handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but I did not sign them." The court asked, "Have you seen the original draft of the declaration of war?" He replied, "I saw it after it was published. It was handed over to the Propaganda Department by the puppet government." The court asked, "Did the puppet government plan to cooperate with the Nationalist army when the American army landed in the later stages of the war? Was there any contact with the central government about this?" He replied, "I did not communicate with Chongqing. I heard Chen Gongbo talk about it. There was communication." The court asked, "Is there any basis for this statement?" He replied, "Yes, everyone agreed verbally. In fact, if we did not cooperate internally, we would be attacked from both sides. Chen Bijun called me to Guangdong and ordered me to maintain law and order during the transition period." At this point, Gao Rong, the public defender of the Jiangsu High Court, rose to defend him, stating in brief: "Before the victory, many people thought that Wang and Chongqing had a tacit understanding and that peace and resistance would lead to the same destination. The defendant truly believed that they would lead to the same destination and his situation is pitiable. Even if he sold opium, it was for prohibition through taxation. The people of the Northeast and North China were indeed more miserable than the general people of the Nanjing puppet government. He is tired of the world and seeks death and should still be sentenced according to the law." Finally, the traitor Chu also cited the example of the traitor Chen Gongbo and requested that his defense be published. The court approved it and announced the conclusion of the debate and that the sentencing would be at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 22nd. The traitor Chu then said: "I will come again on the 22nd," bowed, and left. The time was already 7:15.

### Passing Through Honolulu to Tokyo; Marshall Hurries Back to China; Gillen, Qin Decun, and Others Hold a Meeting in Shenyang

[United Press, Honolulu, 14th] President Truman's special envoy, Marshal Marshall, and his wife departed from Washington, D.C., to return to their post in China. They arrived here today and declared: "We do not know how long we will stay in China." Marshal Marshall did not express his opinion on the purpose of this trip or the fact that his family members were traveling with him. He will depart from here tonight, traveling through Tokyo to China.

[United Press, Shenyang, 15th] The representatives of the Military Three-Person Group are coming to Shenyang to investigate the truth. Their mission is scheduled to be completed tomorrow, and they will return to the capital to report to the three members of the group. According to the opinion of people here, even if special envoy Marshall returns to China and uses his great ability to mediate and prevent bloodshed, it is still doubtful. There are currently two fierce battles underway in the Northeast, with heavy casualties on both sides. According to government sources, the New First Army is slowly advancing towards Siping, encountering a fierce attack from 40,000 Communist troops. Thirty miles southeast of Shenyang, two divisions of the Nationalist 52nd Army are surrounded by Communist troops in the Benxi iron mining area and are currently trying to repel the Communist troops. Now that the fighting is underway, the executive group is helpless. Marshall is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo on the 16th and will definitely arrive in China within a few days. The situation that Marshall is now encountering is, if not more difficult, certainly as difficult as when he began trying to unite the Nationalist and Communist armies in China and jointly preserve lasting peace last December. This is well known and no secret. Three-person group representatives Gillen, Qin Decun, and Chen Shiqu met with representatives from the city for two hours on the 15th and then inspected the factory area. Slogans have been found throughout the city, loudly shouting "Oppose the division of the Northeast" and "Oppose negotiations with bandits."

### The Government Decides to Reorganize as Soon as Possible; The Chairman Hosts a Tea Party for Members of the Political Consultative Conference Small Group; All Parties Accept Instructions to Conduct Consultations

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] Chairman Chiang invited all members of the Comprehensive Small Group of the Political Consultative Conference to a tea party at the National Government at 4:00 PM on the 15th. Those in attendance included Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Shao Lizi, Zhang Qun, Wang Shijie, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, Chen Lifu, Zhou Enlai, Lu Dingyi, Chen Qitian, Zhang Junmai, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, Wang Yunwu, Fu Sinian, Wu Dingchang, and Lei Zhen, totaling more than a dozen people. Chairman Chiang first explained that it had been more than two months since the closing of the Political Consultative Conference and that the reorganization of the government should be realized as soon as possible to stabilize the people's hearts. The convening of the National Congress on May 5 was originally decided by the Political Consultative Conference. Now that the deadline is approaching, the procedures for selecting and announcing representatives will still take a considerable amount of time. It is hoped that the lists of representatives to be submitted by all parties will be submitted to the government for processing before April 20. It is also hoped that the list of National Government Committee members will be submitted at the same time so that the government reorganization can be completed before the return to the capital. Otherwise, the reorganization should be carried out as soon as possible after the return to the capital so that the work of peaceful national construction can be gradually implemented. After the Chairman finished speaking, members Zhou Enlai, Zhang Junmai, Wang Yunwu, and Chen Qitian expressed their opinions one after another and accepted the Chairman's instructions. They hoped that designated personnel would be appointed to conduct consultations. The Chairman immediately appointed members Shao Lizi, Zhang Qun, and Zhang Lisheng and Secretary-General Lei to be responsible for inviting all parties to consult within three or four days to ensure that the government reorganization could be realized as soon as possible and that the National Congress could be convened as scheduled. It is heard that Shao and others will begin consultations separately from the 16th. In addition, the drafting small group for the draft constitutional amendment of the Political Consultative Conference was originally scheduled to convene on the afternoon of the 15th, but due to Chairman Chiang's invitation to all members of the Comprehensive Small Group of the conference to a tea party, it was changed to 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 16th.

### The Verdict and Defense of the Traitor Chen Gongbo are Being Reviewed by the Supreme Court; The Families of the Traitors Chen and Chu Prepare for the Aftermath

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The verdict of the traitor Chen Gongbo and the traitor Chen's defense statement have been delivered to the Supreme Court. According to a certain judge, although the traitor Chen did not appeal, the Supreme Court must still review the traitor Chen's confession, the verdict of the Jiangsu High Court, and the traitor Chen's defense statement in accordance with legal procedures. The fate of the traitor Chen can be decided within the next three days. If the Supreme Court upholds the original verdict in its final ruling on Chen's crimes and sentences him to death, the method of execution may not be hanging, but shooting. The execution site should ideally be in Nanjing, but to avoid the trouble of escorting him, it may be possible to have him die in Suzhou. It is heard that the family of the traitor Chen has begun to prepare for Chen's funeral. It is heard that the family of the traitor Chu Minyi has also begun to prepare Chu's clothes and coffin. Furthermore, according to a certain gentleman close to the legal community, the major traitors of the puppet government may die on the same day, in the same place, and in the same manner, so that China Electric can film a large-scale scene to show the dignity of the national law.

### The Capital Begins Investigating Male and Female Traitors Today

Furthermore, the capital's work on investigating traitors is ready, and the investigation will begin on the 16th. It is said that the first to be interrogated will be major traitors such as Lin Baisheng, Li Shengwu, Mei Siping, Chen Junhui, and Mo Guokang. It is said that the female traitor, Mo Guokang, has been crying all day since Chen Gongbo was sentenced to death, muttering to herself when she sees people, and saying, "I am willing to die in the same lake as Chen Gongbo."

### Iran Suddenly Withdraws Complaint Hours Before Security Council Meeting; Members Repeatedly Reject Soviet Request; Tudeh Party Mutiny Creates Emergency in Iranian Political Situation

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 15th Broadcasting: Hours before the Security Council meeting, the Iranian government suddenly announced that it had instructed its representative to the Security Council to immediately remove the Iranian issue from the agenda. Before announcing this decision, the Iranian Prime Minister had met twice with the new Soviet Ambassador, who assured him that the withdrawal of Soviet troops could be completed before May 6. However, for the sake of caution, the Security Council will nominally keep the Iranian issue on the agenda until it receives confirmation of the Soviet troop withdrawal on May 6.

[United Press, New York, 15th] At today's Security Council meeting, the member states decided to reject the Soviet Union's request to immediately remove the Iranian issue from the agenda, even if Iran asked them to do so.

[United Press, Tehran, 15th] It has been learned here today that the powerful leftist Tudeh Party successfully mutinied yesterday in the industrial center of Isfahan, completely controlling the city, and its influence has expanded to about 300 miles along the Persian Gulf and the southern British oil fields. This mutiny has created a sudden emergency situation for the Iranian government.

[United Press, New York, 15th] A new dispute will erupt at today's Security Council meeting. The Iranian issue will be the first case on the agenda, and the case of Poland requesting action against the Franco regime in the West may be debated on Wednesday. The Polish representative has been preparing their case over the weekend, and this case will again cause a dispute between the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain.

[United Press, Madrid, 15th] The Spanish Minister of Education formally denied last night that any German scientists were conducting atomic energy or other scientific research in Spain, and said that those who accused Spain of this "know very well where German scientists are researching the atomic bomb," but he did not specify the location.

### Truman's Speech at "Pan American Day": People Seeking Happiness Must Have International Cooperation; Foundation of American Good Neighbor Policy is Solid

[United States Information Service, Washington, 15th] The United States commemorated Pan American Day yesterday. President Truman delivered a speech to the Council of the Pan American Union, stating briefly: History will also record how President Roosevelt and his great Secretary of State Hull worked hard to prevent war before 1939 and spread this Good Neighbor policy to the rest of the world. He was hampered by the madness and dreams of world conquest of the Axis dictators and aggressors. However, when the United Nations fought against Nazi fascism, the United States began to lay the foundation for a Good Neighbor policy towards the whole world. You also know how solid the foundation of the Good Neighbor policy is. The United Nations, based on these foundations, has now launched a common cause. I am convinced that the cause of the United Nations will succeed, and must succeed. Before us is a new era, in which the power of atomic energy has been unleashed. In this era, either there will be complete destruction, or the labor of people all over the world will be reduced and the standard of living will be raised. In order to maintain lasting peace, the people of the world have now shown that they are willing to use force when necessary to prevent aggression or the threat of aggression. Everyone is aware that the existence of this force, although it may prevent aggression from running rampant, cannot in itself eliminate the causes of unrest. Like the causes of World War II, beneath the madness of the Nazis were the material difficulties and spiritual hunger caused by poverty and despair. Unless these economic diseases that constitute the causes of war are completely eliminated, the danger of war cannot be completely eliminated. Therefore, we must achieve a material, cultural, and spiritual life that all people in the world have the right to enjoy. We must contribute our energy and resources to this goal. Apart from the word "democracy," I don't know any other word that encompasses this goal. Democrats are fighting for a better life for free people everywhere today. We all feel that the word "democracy" has different meanings in different languages. This term will have different interpretations in different parts of the world, but fortunately, American countries have a common basic understanding of the word "democracy."

Freedom first requires certain political rights, namely freedom of speech, publication, and assembly, freedom of conscience, and the right of the people to choose their form of government. This goal obviously depends on the efforts of each country itself, but if we have learned anything from the past decade, we should know that no country can survive alone. Only through genuine cooperation can the whole world achieve this goal. They need international cooperation in military power to jointly expand production, increase world trade, and develop natural resources, so that all efforts to improve living standards can be established on a solid foundation. The principles that have guided Pan American work in the past already contain this spirit of cooperation. We must, in the days to come, put these principles into practical action and generate concrete results.

### British Instruct Representatives to India to Quickly Find a Solution; Opportunity to End Rule in India is Ripe

[Reuters, London, 15th] The political secretary of the British Independent Labour Party, Brockway, declared yesterday at a mass meeting of the British Indian Association here: The British Labour government has instructed the three cabinet members, Lawrence, Cripps, and Alexander, who are going to India for negotiations, to reach an agreement with Indian leaders before returning home. There are three reasons why the Labour government issued this instruction: (1) The British government knows that the Indian problem must be resolved, and the Indian naval rebellion especially requires Britain to end its rule in India immediately; (2) Britain is now the third strongest country after the United States and the Soviet Union, and knows that Indian discontent will threaten Britain's international policy; (3) Britain needs to find new markets for its goods, which has changed the political landscape. Brockway continued that if the British Labour government wants to convince the Indians of its sincerity in resolving the Indian problem, then the following two things must be done first: (1) Release those who have been detained in court for political reasons; (2) Immediately abolish the salt tax.

### Re-discussing the Housing Shortage Problem in Shanghai

This newspaper discussed the housing shortage problem in Shanghai yesterday because the Executive Yuan recently promulgated measures for allocating housing to various agencies. In fact, the scope of the discussion was only to examine whether the measures stipulated by the Executive Yuan were desirable, and it was still unable to thoroughly investigate how the housing shortage problem could be solved. The meaning was still not exhausted, and we must elaborate further.

Last night, this newspaper received two letters from readers, both expressing their views on the housing shortage problem. One provided supplementary opinions on the Executive Yuan's measures, and the other contributed to this problem from the perspective of government legislation. Here, we will first excerpt the main points of these two letters and then explain our views.

(1) Mr. Xie Yunyi's letter stated, in essence: "The provisions of the Executive Yuan's measures are undoubtedly the proper way to solve the housing problem in this city. However, if there are any imperfections in the implementation of the measures, they should be improved, and the interests of the state and the people should be taken into account. Therefore, these measures should have supplements: First, the principle that this law does not apply retroactively, in order to safeguard the interests of the people, it should be stipulated that households who have already legally rented before the promulgation of these measures should still be regarded as valid after the Housing Committee reviews them and finds no evidence of fraud. Second, except for legally rented houses, houses not owned by enemies or puppets should be uniformly leased by the Central Trust Bureau. As for how to apply for, review, and allocate houses uniformly leased by the Central Trust Bureau, there should also be clear regulations, which should be announced at any time to show great trust. In short, regarding the current housing problem in Shanghai, the government and the people feel the same difficulties. The people should understand and support the government's emergency measures for the urgent need for restoration, and the government should also carefully safeguard the interests of the people. The power of the government should be emphasized, and the freedom of the people should be respected. Only by considering both the national economy and the people's livelihood can we solve the housing problem in Shanghai properly."

(2) Mr. Zhang Etang's letter stated, in essence: "The reason why the supply of houses in Shanghai cannot meet the demand should also be thoroughly explored in terms of government legislation. The wartime housing lease regulations promulgated by the government on December 13, 1943, were originally necessary emergency measures to adapt to wartime needs, and the legislative spirit should be strict, which is understandable. However, on March 18, 1946, the Shanghai Municipal Government revised and promulgated the regulations on housing lease management and the standards for housing rents in Shanghai. The restrictions on the rent and other fees set for landlords are open to discussion in the current social situation. According to these two regulations, the main provisions regarding rent include (1) Landlords shall not collect key money or petty rent from tenants in addition to rent. If they violate this, tenants may sue the court for return. (2) For houses with rent agreed upon before August 13, 1937, the calculation standard should be 60 times for commercial houses and 40 times for residential houses. For those after August 13, 1937, the rent should be calculated according to the same building section and estimated value as in the previous paragraph. Now, this standard has been changed to 180 times and 140 times by the municipal government meeting a few days ago, which is indeed fairer than before. However, according to the current price expenses, landlords who rely on rent income for a living will inevitably still feel difficult. If they ask tenants to adjust and increase rent, they will definitely refuse to pay attention to the regulations. Because large landlords have no profit to be made, they will inevitably prefer to leave the houses idle and not rent them to others, or they are unwilling to invest in building houses. Furthermore, according to Article 11, Paragraph 5 of the Regulations on Housing Lease Management, if a tenant sublets a house and the rent charged exceeds 30% of the original rent, the landlord may terminate the contract. This makes sub-landlords unwilling to sublet vacant houses to others. For example, if a sub-landlord sublets a house with a monthly rent of 1,000 yuan to others, the rent charged cannot exceed 300 yuan at most. Currently, just the deposit for water and electricity guarantee that the sub-landlord bears usually requires paying 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, which is equivalent to wasting interest, although it can be recovered in the future, and other house repair costs are now mostly borne by the sub-landlord, not to mention. Because the profits obtained by the sub-landlord are too limited, they do not compensate for the losses. Unless they want to ask for trouble, they will sublet the house to others, so that most sub-landlords are currently willing to close the door and live alone, enjoying spacious comfort. Before the war, there were advertisements for rent everywhere. During the enemy-puppet period, because there were regulations in the subletting license that the rent charged could not exceed a certain percentage, the advertisements for rent gradually decreased, and now they are simply not seen. In this situation where the index of everything has risen more than a thousand times compared to before the war, there is no legal sanction, but only the rent is forced to not be increased. Such a deformed and unreasonable situation can only serve to unilaterally suppress the rise in rent, but in fact, it only increases the degree of housing shortage. As far as I can see, (1) Key money and petty rent are close to unjust enrichment and must be strictly prohibited. If landlords violate this, not only can they sue the court for return, but the government should also impose heavy fines. (2) Rent should still be determined by mutual agreement in accordance with the Civil Code as a principle. At most, only the monthly rent charged by the landlord for renting out a house should be restricted to not exceed a few thousandths of the original building's valuation. The monthly rent charged by the sub-landlord for subletting a house should not exceed the total amount of the original rent. If the situation changes, it can be increased or decreased with the mutual consent of both parties, or the Housing Management Committee can be asked to mediate. In this way, the rent charged by the landlord for renting out a house will not be without a standard. Sub-landlords can also make a small profit by subletting houses, except for the losses that cannot be shared with the tenants, so as to avoid the disadvantages of closing the house and not renting it. (3) In Article 9 of the Regulations on Housing Lease Management, which stipulates the reasons for terminating the lease, a clause should be added, such as "If the tenant no longer needs the leased house." Because the rent in Shanghai is too low, many residents are greedy for convenience, or prepare it as a place for travel, or the population is small, occupying a large portion, or they rent it out instead of using it. Such situations are not uncommon. When the demand for houses exceeds the supply, strict laws must be enacted to prevent tenants from hoarding houses to harm others and benefit themselves."

The opinions of the two readers quoted above can all be regarded as calm and rational discussions, and they have considerable reasons. We believe that the authorities, looking at the overall situation, will adopt them if they are desirable and can be expected to be adopted in moderation. Here, we would like to add a few more points:

First of all, we believe that the method of uniform leasing by the Central Trust Bureau stipulated by the Executive Yuan should not only be applicable to ordinary private real estate not owned by enemies or puppets, but also should be moderately applicable to houses owned by enemies or puppets. Because if we really want to solve the housing shortage problem, we must focus on this theme. The more houses opened, the better. It does not seem appropriate to simultaneously consider providing a lump sum income for the national treasury. If it is only as stipulated in the original method, "Houses occupied by enemy aliens and owned by enemies or puppets shall be uniformly received and sold by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District," then this large amount of houses will inevitably be exclusively occupied by a few wealthy merchants, and may not be widely rented to civil servants and ordinary citizens. Moreover, it makes people feel that the enemy and puppet real estate received by the government is only sold, and not rented to various agencies and civil servants for housing. Instead, it forces private real estate to be uniformly leased by the Central Trust Bureau, which does not seem fair. The handling of all things in the world should be fair, and if it is not fair, people will naturally complain. Therefore, in order for the government to show its sincerity in solving the housing shortage, it is especially important to take the lead in setting an example of how to uniformly rent out the real estate that the government can control in the future. Moreover, whether there are actually all kinds of subjects in the method of uniform sale. It also seems very questionable at this time whether you are willing to bid for high-priced real estate from the government. The government's temporary lump sum income may not be guaranteed, and it must first force the residents who originally lived in this enemy and puppet real estate to move out within a time limit before it is sold, making them have to compete with other citizens for other types of housing, which seems to increase the degree of housing panic.

Secondly, the uniform leasing of private real estate by the Trust Bureau should be regarded as the principle of the method, and exceptions cannot be tolerated within a reasonable scope. This so-called exception is not to open a door of convenience, but to respect the legitimate rights and interests of the original owners and the legitimate leases of various agencies or civil servants, which must be done in this way. For example: If the house was actually used by the owner himself before the war, and there is a household registration record in the neighborhood, but it was forcibly occupied or rented by the enemy or puppets due to the war, and now the owner has either returned to Shanghai from afar, or moved back to the Hongkou Jiangwan area from Haman, and still needs to use it himself, and can find a reliable guarantee, whether in terms of emotion, reason, or law, he should be allowed to use it himself and exempted from uniform leasing. Furthermore, if the owner has indeed entered into a legal lease with various normal agencies or restored civil servants before the promulgation of these seven measures, then from the original intention of the government's uniform leasing, it cannot be considered contrary to this. The owner has neither met with illegal and illegally obtained key money or petty rent, and his tenants are also the objects to whom the government must allocate housing, then why should the government "re-lease" them once again, which is not afraid of trouble? We hope that the responsible committee and the Central Trust Bureau should carefully consider such matters. As for Mr. Xie's principle that this law does not apply retroactively, acknowledging the validity of all previously signed leases is theoretically feasible, but it should be noted whether these signed leases have the fact of being handed over and backdated? It is said that recently, when the enemy aliens vacated a certain large alley on Shigaota Road in Hongkou, the owner, a certain real estate company, turned it into zero overnight, turning it into several owners. Each building became the owner's own use, but in fact, the real estate company collected huge amounts of key money and petty rent and signed separate leases. This kind of behavior will naturally be unbearable for the poor civil servants who have returned from the rear!

Finally, we would like to discuss the issue of rent. Mr. Zhang believes that the rent restriction is too low, hindering the construction of new houses, which is partly true. However, it is not certain at this time whether allowing the rent to be increased can satisfy the landlord's desires and encourage their interest in building houses. It must be known that the current market interest rate is often above 10%. May I ask whether the rent can be so high even if it is high? Assuming that the cost of materials and labor is estimated, a single building will cost 10 million yuan. Can the monthly rent be stipulated to be 1 million yuan? Even if the government does not restrict it and allows it completely, may I ask which ordinary citizens can rent this kind of single building? To be honest, in today's deformed market, unless interest rates return to normal, the major event of building houses to please the people is something that probably no private individual is willing to invest in unless the government takes responsibility for it! Moreover, the method of allowing the rent to be increased and determined according to the cost valuation ratio can only be applied to newly built houses. As for houses that have been built for a long time, even if they can be allowed to be increased moderately, they are not allowed to be rented according to this calculation, because the value at the time of construction was indeed low. Now, after the war, the houses still exist, which is equivalent to the fact that the cost they paid at that time has preserved its monetary value. If the interest is calculated based on this increased value and the rent is determined, then the rent must be surprisingly high, and this kind of excessive profit for the landlord is nothing more than the exploitation of the blood and sweat of ordinary poor people. We admit that large landlords are mostly unprofitable at this time, but please ask them to make a big calculation. After eight years of bloody war, they were still able to preserve the houses, which is equivalent to preserving the monetary value. They are very lucky. What should be required for them is that at this time, the transfer or lease of real estate should not unduly force them to pay excessive taxes, so that the sale and purchase of real estate can be circulated. We also admit that sub-landlords are not all bad, and third tenants are not necessarily all deceived, but in any case, sub-landlords "rent land as self-produced," and after renting a house, they can ask for a price for the key money, but the owner has no right to ask questions, which is ultimately the main reason why the owner is bored in the future. Therefore, when studying the housing problem today, we must first use political power to fully protect the owner's sovereignty within the scope of the law, and increasing the rent is secondary.

Tai County and Xinghua County

Communist Troops Capture the Intellectual Class

Since the county seat of this county was recovered by the National Army, Huangqiao Town in the Fourth District is still occupied by the Communist army of Chen Yusheng's unit. Conscription and requisition of grain are the basic tasks of this army. In recent months, the approach has been greatly changed, with what is called "two months of undemocratic rule". All township and village chiefs and paochia heads, as well as those with some assets and knowledge in the areas controlled by the army, are given the title of "Nationalist Special Agents" and subjected to large-scale arrests and extortion of property. Any resistance is met with brutal killing. The citizens of the town are living in dire straits. Recently, postal services between the city and Huangqiao have also been blocked. After the local post office was forcibly taken over by the Communist army last month, on April 1st, all Chinese Communist Party (CCP) stamps were uniformly used, and the use of legal tender was strictly prohibited. The original post office staff were forced to undergo training and were not granted freedom. It is now known that the former postmaster Lei Zuolin, who was forced to resign, escaped to Tai County and Xinghua County yesterday taking advantage of an opportunity.

### Important Nazi Intelligence Agency Uncovered; Leader Was a Confidant of Hitler; All Culprits Arrested by American Troops; May Be Tried in China; Yesterday Already Transferred to the Ward Road Jail

[Special Dispatch from the United Press, Shanghai, 15th] After the surrender of Germany, its intelligence agencies in China continued to operate until the Japanese aggressors surrendered. It is reported that seven German intelligence officers, after several months of investigation, were arrested by the American military today, along with one Japanese national. They will all be listed as war criminals for endangering the United States. This is an important batch of international war criminals arrested by the Far East Command. It is rumored that these individuals may be tried in China. Among those arrested, Lieutenant Colonel Anhalt is the most "famous". Anhalt's other names are Ernst Wagener, and he is also known as Count Schwerin. US Navy Lieutenant Farrell has been assigned to handle the Anhalt case since last September. According to him, Anhalt was a confidant of Hitler and served as the leader of the German Fifth Column in the Balkans in the 1930s. Anhalt is nearly sixty years old but is very energetic. He had great influence in the Nazi regime and had the authority to discuss national affairs with major ambassadors. Among the other arrested are Herbert Natter, a German code expert. The American coastal defense code was once deciphered by him, so German submarines were once very successful in sinking American ships, and he received a medal for this. One Japanese person was arrested, named Takashima, 29 years old. When Japanese General Yamashita visited Germany before the signing of the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy and Japan, Takashima served as Yamashita's adjutant and is rumored to be an important figure among Japanese spies.

During the war, all communications between Germany and Japan were handled by him. Takashima served as the president of the Central China Promotion Company, which was established by the Japanese and was a powerful agency for controlling Chinese materials. Takashima was an honorary major in the Japanese Army. The other German arrested was Lejeune, 43 years old, who was the personal pilot of former German Air Force Commander Goering. His important duty was to gather air force intelligence. War criminals were sent to the free areas of China to investigate the situation of the US Air Force stationed in China. Another German, named Schenk, was a German correspondent in China. He is rumored to be a spy with rich experience, outwardly pretending to oppose the Nazis,

Supporting Chongqing,

Even writing articles attacking Hitler, to gain the trust of the Chinese people. It is said that he discovered the route for Americans to escape to the free areas of China. In addition, two people named Rossi and Montevini, who were radio operators on the Italian ship "Conte Verde", were also arrested for being employed by Anhalt to engage in espionage. Two others, Rudolf and Detlef, are already in custody. Rudolf was a German naval captain, rumored to have come to China with Anhalt in 1942. Detlef was a

Code expert.

Lieutenant Connell of the US military court's prosecutor's office in China notified the defendants this morning to report for investigation. The group gathered in one room, and three US military police ordered them to line up and state their names. The group felt caught off guard by the arrest. They have now been sent to the Ward Road Jail, and it remains to be decided when and where they will be tried. The Chinese side is also interested in this case, as the defendants' actions clearly endangered China. However, it is believed that the US will obtain permission to handle the case freely. The US military authorities announced today that no German spies have escaped so far. Farrell and Gores of the US Special Intelligence Group began to handle this case immediately after Japan's surrender, sparing no effort. During the investigation, they traveled to Guangzhou, Beijing, and other places.

### Last Batch of Japanese Nationals Leave Shanghai by Ship

Today, eight American ships will repatriate the last batch of Japanese nationals. The remaining technical personnel and staff of the Japanese Residents' Association, numbering four to five thousand, will be sent back in succession later. As of today, a total of 98,553 Japanese nationals and 32,3039 Japanese prisoners of war have been repatriated.

### One Japanese War Criminal Escorted from Hong Kong to Shanghai

Fukuchi, the chief of staff of Lieutenant General Tanaka, the commander of the Japanese Southern China Expeditionary Army, was escorted from Hong Kong to Shanghai yesterday aboard a US Navy destroyer. He will be tried here. Fukuchi is accused of being responsible for the murder of US pilot Major Hawk.

### First Meeting of the Housing Allocation Committee

Recently, the Executive Yuan, in conjunction with military and political organs, organized the Shanghai Organs Housing Allocation Committee, stipulating seven specific measures. The details have been recorded in the newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the committee held its first meeting. Qian Dajun, Peng Xuepei, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jilun, Li Jilan, Liu Gongyun, Huang Bo, Song Siyi, Wang Guanghan, Xue Cihua, and Chen Guanqiu were in attendance. It is reported that the content of the meeting included the decision to additionally appoint Huang Bo as the deputy chairman of the committee and Xue Cixin as the secretary-general. The organizational regulations were also discussed, with the secretary-general being responsible for handling routine tasks, and four groups were established: general affairs, allocation, investigation, and execution. The committee will convene another meeting within days.

### Fourth Batch of Han Traitors Escorted; Seventeen Individuals Including Pseudo-Propaganda Department Vice-Minister Zhang Ke; Eleven Taiwanese War Criminals Escorted to the Military Law Supervisory Department

(Report from this newspaper) The Han traitors arrested in Shanghai by a certain military organ after the victory, since the beginning of the wooden month (Month of the Wood Sheep, likely August) of the year, have been sent in three batches to the Shanghai High Procuratorate and the Nanjing Army Headquarters Military Law Enforcement Supervisory Department. Yesterday, the fourth batch was escorted. Yesterday morning, two large military jeeps escorted fifteen people from the Shanghai Prison, including Zhang Ke, the pseudo-vice-minister of the Propaganda Department; Li Fang, the chairman of the United Association of the Chinese Hung Society during the enemy occupation; and Zhao, Bi Jianbo, Ma Le, Jin Jianhong, Ren Ke, Xu Hengbo, Wang Weicai, Tang Yaoliang, Ling Jia, Du Li, Xue Qishou, Lu Bingyuan, Tao Ci, etc. On the same day, Zhang Yuqing and Yu Shaoting were escorted to the Army Headquarters.

In addition, eleven Taiwanese war criminals were also escorted to the Army Headquarters Military Law Supervisory Department for trial yesterday. The reason for the transfer is that Taiwanese people who committed crimes during the War of Resistance should be dealt with under international law, according to Interpretation No. 3078 of the Judicial Yuan. Those escorted from a certain military unit yesterday included: (1) Liu Yaohua, secretary of the pseudo-China Model Youth Corps; (2) Chen Xingcun, manager of the Nanhua Tobacco Company, who used huge amounts of money and military supplies to aid the enemy and took advantage of the enemy's power to seize the property of our people; (3) Hu Qiyi, general affairs of the Nanhua Tobacco Company, who was involved in the same case as Chen Xingcun; (4) Wu Canggui, translator for the enemy's Tsuchibashi and Koga units; (5) Lin Bohu, translator for the enemy's Shanghai West Gendarmerie; (6) Huang Tingliang, temporary translator for the enemy's gendarmerie at the Shanghai Racecourse; (7) Ye Renhui, supervisor of the enemy's Nanshi prisoner-of-war camp; (8) Zhou Lintian, administrator of the enemy's prisoner-of-war camp; (9) Zhu Haichuang, registrar of the enemy's prisoner-of-war camp; (10) Cai Sen, guard of the enemy's Morita unit prisoner-of-war camp; (11) Hong, guard of the enemy's Nanjing military prisoner-of-war camp.

Zhao Zunyue and Others Interrogated Yesterday

[Report from this newspaper] The High Procuratorate interrogated a large number of Han traitors, and many have been indicted. Yesterday, the High Procuratorate also interrogated Zhao Zunyue (pseudo-Minister of Propaganda), Chen Guoquan (pseudo-Chairman of the Rice Control Committee), Xu Weizhen (pseudo-President of the Shanghai High Court), as well as Li Zuyu, Li Yimin, Ni Nongxiang, etc.

### Pseudo Rice Control Committee Secretary-General Zhou Chunyu Sentenced to Eight Years

[Report from this newspaper] The High Court announced the verdict on two Han traitor cases yesterday: (1) Zhou Chunyu, Secretary-General of the Pseudo Rice Control Committee. Main text: Conspiring with the enemy to resist this country, sentenced to eight years of imprisonment, deprived of civil rights for eight years, and all property confiscated except for the necessary living expenses for family members. (2) Huang Junjie, member of the Pseudo Shanghai Security Command Investigation Team. Main text: Colluding with the enemy and serving in military positions related to military affairs, sentenced to five years of imprisonment, deprived of civil rights for five years, and all property confiscated except for the necessary living expenses for family members.

In addition, the cases of Li Wenqi, Zhang Xiaodao, and Xing were interrogated yesterday. As a result, it was decided to postpone the investigation and interrogate them again at a later date. Furthermore, the arguments in the cases of Zhu Ruilin and Huang Jiang were concluded, and the verdict was set for the 22nd.

### First Members' Representative Assembly of the Three Principles of the People Youth League

The first Members' Representative Assembly of the Shanghai Branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League opened at 10 a.m. the day before yesterday. The assembly was held at the site of the Provisional Council and was scheduled to last three days. On the first day (the day before yesterday), the opening ceremony was held, and the newly elected supervisors and inspectors of each district branch took their oath of office. Xuan Tiewu, a special delegate sent by the Central Ministry stationed in Shanghai, attended to supervise the oath-taking ceremony, which was presided over by Director-General Wu Shaoshu. Youth League instructor Qian Dajun and Central League representative Xuan Qianwu also delivered speeches after the chairman's opening remarks. Finally, Gu Yuxiu delivered a speech on behalf of all the guests. Yesterday was the second day of the assembly, and the agenda included a review of work and discussion of proposals.

### Electricity Bills to Increase Surcharge; Additional 26 Yuan per Kilowatt-Hour; Explanation of Reasons by Public Utilities Bureau Officials

The surcharge on electricity prices in this city will increase by 26 yuan per kilowatt-hour from April 16th. According to officials of the Public Utilities Bureau, the price of electricity in this city has always been based on the price of coal. The coal used by the power plants in this city is allocated by the government, so the price of electricity is lower than in major domestic cities. For example, the price of electricity for small households in Chongqing is 150 yuan per kilowatt-hour, and in Nanjing it is 140 yuan. However, due to the increased cost of coal mines, the price of coal in January increased to over 23,000 yuan per ton, but the price of electricity in this city was not increased. In March, the price of coal changed again to over 29,000 yuan, which is lower than the market price, but the income and expenses of various companies cannot be offset, and losses are increasing daily. The Shanghai Electric Power Company loses 800 million yuan per month, the French Electric Light Company loses 140 million yuan per month, and the Chinese Three Electric Power Company also loses 130 million yuan per month. Therefore, considering the actual situation, in accordance with the method of increasing the surcharge approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, a coal jin surcharge of 26 yuan per kilowatt-hour will be added to each level of electricity consumption, that is, the price of electricity for small users will increase from 24 yuan to 50 yuan per kilowatt-hour, in order to maintain the company's business. If the supply of coal is abundant and the price of coal is low, it should still be reduced. Furthermore, the power generation capacity of various companies in this city is limited by the amount of equipment, and it is already insufficient. It is hoped that citizens can make every effort to conserve electricity.

### Number of Senators to be Elected; 181 in the City; Election Scheduled for the 28th of This Month; Approximately 2.5 Million Voters

[Report from this newspaper] The election of city senators in this city has been scheduled for the 28th of this month. According to regulations, the basic number of senators to be elected in the city's regional elections is 19. For every 30,000 people exceeding 100,000, one additional senator is added. The total population of this city is based on the statistics from the household registration survey in February of this year, totaling 3,345,875 people. Therefore, an additional 108 senators should be elected, for a total of 127 senators. The city senators to be elected by professional organizations account for three-tenths of the total number of senators, totaling 54 senators. Therefore, there are a total of 181 city senators in the entire region. The number of senators allocated to each electoral district in this city is determined in accordance with Article 9 of the City Senator Election Regulations, based on the proportion. That is, one senator is produced for every 26,345 people; the remainder is allocated to the districts with the largest fractional numbers in order. However, it is found that the national identity cards in the city have not yet been fully distributed. The municipal government has now decided to distribute the receipts for national identity cards as temporary substitutes before April 20th, which can be used to collect ballot papers in the future. It is estimated that there are approximately 2.5 million voters in the city, and more than half are expected to register to participate in the election. As of yesterday, a total of 1,189 candidates for public office had been

Successfully inspected. Among them, 1,039 are from various districts, and 150 are from professional organizations. Among the districts, Taishan District ranks first with 112 people, Huangpu District ranks second with 90 people, and Xincheng District ranks third with 84 people. Among the professional organizations, the Free Professionals Organization ranks first with 45 people, the Chamber of Commerce ranks second with 40 people, and the Labor Union ranks third with 36 people.

### To Send Food to Detained Han Traitors; Must Designate Yong'an and Sincere to Purchase

The Temporary Detention Center of the High Court is specifically established for detaining Han traitors. Now, in order to pay attention to the health of the detainees, eight provisional measures have been formulated. The contents are excerpted as follows: "Hereafter, in addition to sending in clothes, which will still be handled according to the original regulations, if food is to be provided, a permit to purchase and send items to support detained criminals must first be obtained from this office and taken to Sincere and Yong'an Companies designated by this office for purchase (limited to canned goods, bread, and fruits). The companies will send the items directly to this office for delivery to the recipient. Family members of the detainees are not allowed to send in items themselves. In order to increase the detainees' exercise time, the cells will be opened three times a day in rotation, including one outdoor exercise and two indoor walks. However, if the age is over 60, or if the illness has been diagnosed by the physician of this office as requiring treatment, the chief of the detention center may extend the closing time as appropriate. Detainees who need beds may be allowed to prepare their own, but only No. 3 canvas beds are allowed. Family members or friends of the detainees may also send in a considerable amount of reserve funds, but it should be handed over to the custody section of this office for safekeeping. If the detainee needs necessary items, they may be purchased on their behalf after being reported to and approved by the chief of the detention center.

Beds Allowed

### Request to Temporarily Exempt from Demolishing Houses; Residents of Avenue Petain Petition

The Municipal Council is Considering Remedial Measures

### Poverty, Hunger, Famine, and Pestilence: Jiangxi on the Brink of Disaster. The People are Shouting in Desperation for a Way to Live.

— South Nanchang Dispatch, April 1, by Li Guohua

The war has been over for half a year, and most of the enemy troops within Jiangxi have been sent out of the country. However, this Yu Cao Plain, ravaged by the invading army for seven years, is now facing another, even more terrifying enemy: the widespread poverty, hunger, famine, and pestilence that plague the entire province.

Rapidly Rising Grain Prices: A Sixty-Year-Old Woman Eats Vegetable Roots

Let's take Nanchang City as an example: Since the victory, prices have been soaring, especially the price of grain, which has taken the lead. In six months, it has increased twentyfold, from 1,200 yuan per shi of rice to over 25,000 yuan today. The black market price is even 30,000 yuan, and it is still rising! The people in the occupied areas and the displaced refugees have suffered from the oppression and plunder of the enemy, and they have no grain left in their homes. They cannot even find a piece of broken cotton clothing to keep warm, and they huddle in the broken walls and weeds, suffering from the cold wind and rain of spring! How can they afford even a sheng and a half of rice to fill their stomachs? They can only dig up tree roots and grass to cook and barely survive. During the last days of the lunar year, the Provincial Winter Relief Association distributed relief rice. One group encountered an old woman in her sixties, Liu Zhao, living in a dilapidated house at No. 7 Fenghuang Slope in the city, cooking tree roots. The relief workers immediately tasted the sliced and boiled tree roots. They were tasteless and hard, difficult to swallow, and left a bitter, uncomfortable feeling in the stomach! But in Nanchang City alone, there are about 20,000 impoverished and helpless people who use these bitter, hard-to-swallow tree roots as their food to prolong their lives!

Everything is Gone: Spring Famine Closely Follows

Nanchang is still a large city in Jiangxi! What is the situation in other disaster-stricken counties? For example, Gaoan, Dean, Fengxin, and Shanggao in western Jiangxi were all prosperous counties before the war. Now, in many places, there are no signs of human habitation for dozens of miles, and three to four million mu of land are barren. The draft cattle in the rural areas have all been slaughtered, and even the rice seeds that were left for planting were looted by the retreating enemy last autumn. Batch after batch of refugees return to their ruined homes, with nothing to eat, nowhere to live, and facing weed-filled wastelands. The draft cattle, plows, and seeds are all gone. How can they reclaim the land? How can they cultivate it? At the same time, pestilence takes the opportunity to invade this group of hungry and suffering people, snatching away their remaining lives!

In the Pingxiang area of western Jiangxi, the great illness of seven years has not yet slightly healed, and last year they suffered a drought unseen for decades. The early rice harvest was nil, and the late rice harvest averaged less than 30% for the entire county. The Pingxiang area has always been a grain-deficient county. Even in a year of full harvest, they would still be short of three months' worth of grain. How can the people of western Jiangxi withstand such devastation, with enemy disasters and natural disasters striking one after another! Judging from the current situation, a severe spring famine is likely to follow the drought this year!

Due to the retreat of enemy troops along both banks of the Gan River in Guangdong province last spring and summer, the counties in southern and central Jiangxi suffered even greater losses. In particular, in the three counties of San'nan on the border of Guangdong and Jiangxi, the enemy implemented a planned policy of burning, killing, and looting. Everything they could not take away was burned. The draft cattle and livestock were slaughtered, and even the fish in the ponds were killed with lime. The major market towns along both banks of the Gan River, such as Sanqu Tan and Xiajiang in Wan'an, Taihe, Ji'an, Jishui counties, as well as Xingan, Zhangshu, Fengcheng, and Shiwu, were all severely destroyed. In particular, only a few buildings remained in the cities of Wan'an and Xiajiang counties. The fields were filled with human corpses and cattle hooves. From Fengcheng down to Nanchang, nine out of ten houses on both sides of the river were destroyed, and Shiwu was completely burned to the ground. The severity of the disaster can be seen from this.

The Black Hand of the Plague Spreads from Eastern Jiangxi

After the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line battles of 1942, the counties in eastern Jiangxi suffered greatly from the enemy's devastation. In the past two years, the local vitality has not yet recovered, but the plague, which is even more terrifying than war, is quietly spreading in this area. This "Black Death," capable of killing thousands upon thousands, spread from Guangze to Nancheng in the winter of 1942. It is said that during the peak of the epidemic, the dead could not even buy coffins, and some infected families even perished together.

Disease and germs have always accompanied the god of war. After the war, the plague in eastern Jiangxi naturally accelerated its spread, preying on the impoverished people. Therefore, the plague in Nancheng re-emerged in October last year, even more rampant than in the early summer of last year. The epidemic area has expanded to more than sixty or seventy li outside the four villages. At the same time, two types of plague cases were discovered: pneumonic plague and meningitic plague. According to Professor Liu Nanshan of Zhongzheng Medical College, these two types of plague are transmitted through the air, and their rate of spread and mortality are more than twice that of ordinary plague. For example, when someone in Nancheng died of the plague, relatives and friends who came to mourn were infected and died after returning home. Later, even the coffin carriers who carried the deceased's coffin were infected. Also, a certain country squire in Zhuliang Township thought that the plague was caused by demons, so he cast out demons. But within a few days, Zhuliang Township was affected by the plague, with as many as ninety-nine patients. Stories of rampant plague like this have become very common in the besieged city.

This spring, the black hand of the plague has reached Nanfeng! The first discovery was in a household at No. 1 Liushuxia outside the north gate of the county. Two dead rats were first discovered, and later relatives from the countryside brought a one-year-old boy and a ten-year-old girl as guests. The boy suddenly fell ill and died two days later. The girl became ill one day after the boy's illness and died two days later. The symptoms were all blackening of the body, tearing, and runny nose without coughing. Then, Yuan Hu, a woman living at No. 1 Chengxia outside the north gate, also suddenly developed a high fever, headache, conjunctival congestion, and lethargy. She was treated that evening by the director of the Nanfeng Health Institute and the captain of the Jiangxi Epidemic Prevention Third Team, but the next morning, swelling of the lymph nodes in the groin on both sides was discovered. Her complexion was cyanotic, and she coughed and vomited before dying that night. A dead rat was found under the bed after her death. According to the neighbors of this woman, they had seen four dead rats the day before she fell ill, and one rat went out to drink water during the day and died immediately. Up to the beginning of this month, although no new patients have been discovered, dead rats have been found every day and have spread to Zhonghua East Road in the city.

Contagious Diseases: There is a Risk of Outbreaks Everywhere

Nancheng and Nanfeng counties are geographically the center of eastern Jiangxi and an important town in the Min-Gan junction area. Nancheng is only 160 li away from Nanchang to the north. After the war, refugees from Ganbei (northern Jiangxi) and other provinces in the Gan Dongnan (southeast Jiangxi) area all passed through here on their way back home. If strict precautions are not taken, the plague will be transmitted to various places by the movement of refugees. Therefore, the spread of this epidemic is no longer just a serious problem in one corner of Jiangxi!

In addition to the terrifying plague, other types of prevalent infectious diseases are breaking out everywhere. This spring, meningitis broke out in Juyin Pit, an important market town in Yudu. In less than a month, more than fifty villagers died. Cases have also been discovered in Xingguo, Yongxiu, and Shicun and the urban area near Nanchang. Recently, the prevalence of measles and smallpox in Nanchang and Jiujiang can be said to have broken all previous records. The rampant epidemic is certainly a seed planted by the war. The enemy slaughtered people and livestock everywhere, and the rotting corpses are the best breeding ground for germs. In addition, the winter was unusually warm, and there has not been a heavy snowfall to this day. This abnormal climate has become a breeding ground for germs this year. According to doctors, the prevalent infectious diseases in Jiangxi this summer are bound to be much more serious than in previous years!

There is Nothing to Eat: Where Would Surplus Grain Come From?

"Severe war disaster!" "Rising prices!" "Epidemic prevalence!" News like this has occupied a considerable amount of space in Jiangxi newspapers almost every day for the past three months, and reports of representatives of public opinion organs in various counties appealing to the authorities for relief are even more numerous.

Whenever I meet these elders from the disaster areas, they mostly say with tears in their eyes: "There are no draft cattle! There are no seeds! Even the farming tools are gone! When we go back, everyone stares blankly at the ruins. There is nothing to eat, and they still want to requisition surplus grain. Alas! How are the common people supposed to live?"

Once, I met a gentleman from Xiajiang County who said: "After the enemy's intrusion, the population of Xiajiang is only more than 30,000, but the quota for requisitioning surplus grain is as high as 100,000 shi. According to the current population, even including infants, each person has to contribute three dan of grain. In reality, we don't even have enough to eat ourselves, so where would surplus grain come from!"

Heavy Apportionment: Petty Officials Urgently Demand Payment

In addition to the huge quota of two million shi of grain pressing on the shoulders of the starving people of Jiangxi, there are also blood-sucking worms sucking blood from the impoverished people. These blood-sucking worms are those unscrupulous local petty officials. I remember that Mr. Liu Wendao, representing the central government, came to Jiangxi to comfort the people a month ago. When he visited the rural towns near Nanchang and entered a small restaurant, a middle-aged woman was sitting at the counter, holding an infant who had not yet been weaned. After exchanging a few pleasantries, Mr. Liu asked about her living situation. She said, "My house was burned down by the Japanese army. Now I rent this small shop for two dan of grain a month, and my daily business is only about 1,000 yuan." She went on to say, "It's really not easy to make a living. At the same time, there are many apportionments, and the payment is urgently demanded. Since we came here a month ago, the Baojia (local security system) has apportioned more than 3,000 yuan." Mr. Liu hurriedly asked, "What kind of donations are they?" She said, "Every month, everyone, regardless of age, has to contribute three sheng of rice and 100 yuan. When it was the New Year (Gregorian calendar), each family was also assigned 200 yuan. There are also road repair fees and sanitation donations. Even this small child who has just turned one week old has to be assigned to repair roads. If he can't do it, he has to hire someone. For those of us who run restaurants, we also have to provide bedding for ten days every month. My family of four only has one bed. How can we spare it? If we don't, we have to pay a rental fee of 50 yuan per night to rent bedding to send it in." Mr. Liu asked, "Are there receipts for the apportioned donations?" She shook her head and said, "Never." Mr. Liu asked again, "What are these donations used for?" She repeatedly said, "I don't know."

And this is still a rural area less than twenty li away from Nanchang, the location of the provincial government!

President Truman and former President Hoover discussed at the White House about saving domestic food to help the impoverished countries in Europe and Asia.

### Promoting Peace with a World Language

—

The human race is diverse, and there are many languages. When crossing from country A to country B, language barriers arise; various affairs often require the assistance of translators, which is very inconvenient. Especially at the beginning of the atomic age, international boundaries have been eliminated, so a common world language is necessary. If there is a common world language, one will not encounter language difficulties and various barriers when traveling around the world. Extending this further: if languages are connected, the world can become one family, and world peace will inevitably be more consolidated, and the cruel atomic war will inevitably be eliminated.

Mrs. Roosevelt said in a speech at a theater in London on January 26: "I intend to propose to the United Nations that schools all over the world should be forced to teach a common language for international use. Language barriers are the most likely to hinder world peace, so I hope that the United Nations can stipulate that children all over the world, in addition to learning their own national language, should also learn a world language."

She believes that "children all over the world should, in addition to learning their own national language, also learn a world language." This is an extremely alarming statement. If the whole world has a common language, then the "language barriers" that hinder peace can be completely eliminated. However, the current question is: what kind of "world language" should we learn? In the past, the language of diplomacy was French, and even all disputes in the text were based on French; while the language most widely used in the world is English, but these two languages ​​can only be called "diplomatic languages" and "international commercial languages," not universal and pure "world languages." Mrs. Roosevelt's so-called "world language" was not clearly pointed out. I think that if children all over the world must learn a world language to meet the needs of the times, then learning English or French is not enough to be called a "world language," because these two languages ​​still have their scope, and using English and French as "world languages" is inappropriate, because these two languages ​​still have "nationality," not "internationality" (universality), so they cannot be adopted as a universally used language.

Linguist Zamenhof examined the issue of a universal language for the world thirty years ago, promoting human culture and eliminating language barriers. After painstaking research, he finally invented a "world language" (Esperanto). This "world language" integrates the advantages of languages ​​from various countries, and has phonetic alphabets, vowels, consonants, words, grammar, composition, etc., which are simple and easy to learn, and does not contain the narrowness of some national languages. However, it has not been valued for decades, so its promotion has not been widespread. To this day, it still has not made much achievements, which is a great pity.

Of course, Chai's "World Language" may not be a perfect "World Language", but undoubtedly, today's world needs a "World Language" to promote human peace and avoid the most urgent opportunity for "Third Sacrifice" (Mrs. Luo's words). We hope that the United Nations organization will not neglect "World Language" when discussing "World Peace," because "World Language" is possible as a bridge for "World Peace."

### Starting with the Death of Xiao Bingzhang

— Jiang Zhaoran

Xiao Bingzhang, a member of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, is dead!

He was sick for three months, during which he only hired two doctors with lower consultation fees, which his wife paid for by selling her clothes. Later, his condition improved daily, and the doctor instructed him to eat more tonics, but due to financial constraints, he could not fulfill this wish and passed away! Before his death, he said to his wife: "There is no money at home now, and I don't need a shroud or coffin. You can just wrap me in a straw mat and bury me anywhere." After his death, the Provincial Government often sent people to his home to handle the funeral and allocated 2 million yuan for funeral expenses. On the day of the funeral, a public memorial ceremony was held, and the heads of all sectors of the provincial capital attended in person.

All in all, these things can be said to be: Xiao Bingzhang lived a very hard life, but after his death, he was given extreme honors.

Xiao Bingzhang has been engaged in revolution for forty years. He was honest and incorruptible, and it is certainly deserving that he received extreme honors after his death; but it cannot be said that his extremely hard life before his death was not a regret. Just imagine: if he had not "worried about food and shelter day and night," how could he have become sick from worry? If he had become sick and his condition had improved daily, and he had been able to follow the doctor's instructions to eat more tonics, how could he have been hopeless for recovery? Even if he had lived for a very short period after recovery, he always cherished time as if it were his life, and how many things could he have done for the country and the people? Therefore, it cannot be said that his extremely hard life before his death was not a regret; and it cannot be said that the extreme honors after his death were not a satire!

Xiao Bingzhang was a "good civil servant"! There are many problems with "bad civil servants" in the current society, and there are also many "good civil servants" like Xiao Bingzhang; Xiao Bingzhang is dead and cannot be saved. For the "good civil servants" like Xiao Bingzhang who have not died, I think we should treat them with reason when they die in the future, and we should also treat them with reason while they are alive. This should be done to "clean up officialdom," and it should also be done to cultivate the atmosphere of "life is aimed at service"!

### Without a Sense of Integrity

— Wu Xiao

Every night when I come back from Xizang Road, I always see the four red characters "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, Shame" on the roof of the International Hotel; precisely because they are so high, I have already seen them from far away. Only after I immerse myself in Hankou Road do I no longer see them.

Recently, I don't know why, the neon tube of the "Integrity" character has broken the " 겸 (jian)" inside, leaving only the outer shell "产" of the "Integrity (廉lian)" character still glowing. When I first discovered this changed "Integrity" character, I thought it was just a temporary breakdown and that someone would definitely repair it, but what I saw the next night was still "Propriety, Justice, Shame" and the "Integrity" character with only half of its outer shell lit.

The third day, the fourth day, ... until a moment ago before I wrote this article, this broken "Integrity" character seems to have not been noticed by anyone; I feel a little inexplicable disappointment.

If the International Hotel roof only had the three characters "Propriety, Justice, Shame" from the beginning, then passers-by would have known that it did not have "Integrity"; or if the entire "Integrity" character was broken, then we could see that there is no "Integrity" now! Unfortunately, there is half of the outer shell of "Integrity," but there is no inner heart of "Integrity."

### China's Friend – Donald

— Zhong Zuozhen

"He is really an extraordinary person," said the famous writer John Kinsey. Indeed, Mr. Donald is a great figure who turned the tide of Chinese history with his own hands. His profound writing awakened the Chinese people; in the Xi'an Incident in December 1936, he influenced the Young Marshal Zhang Xueliang, safely rescued Chairman Chiang, and completed the unification of the country.

Chairman Chiang's diary contains the following passage: "People all think that Mr. Donald is a specially appointed consultant of the government. In fact, he helps China entirely as a friend. He has refused the most honorable positions several times."

Mr. Donald's personality is straightforward and unpretentious, and he hates fraud. Since he left his native Australia in 1902, he has been working in China. Because he loves China and hopes that it can be revived, he does not hesitate to travel repeatedly, so he and General Marshall are both known as great "go-betweens".

When he was young, he was proficient in riding, archery, and fishing, especially his horsemanship, which was admired by the northerners who were good at riding. Golf occupied most of his daily leisure time.

Unfortunately, Mr. Donald developed lung cancer, "May the medical community create another miracle and let him recover as soon as possible." The Chinese people unanimously wish him well.

### Culture and Education

Feng Bian-dai asks: Please provide detailed instructions on the following: (1) How many normal schools, either registered with or established by the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, are there in the Shanghai urban or rural areas? (2) Which is the most historical normal school and where is its address? (3) Now that tuition fees for municipal primary and secondary schools are waived, are tuition fees also waived for normal schools? (4) What level of junior high school education is required for transfer students entering the third year of normal school? Is there a requirement to serve in schools for one year after graduation? (5) What are the differences between the textbooks used in normal schools and junior high schools?

Zhang Yi-qu answers: (1) There are only two normal schools in the Shanghai urban area: (A) Shanghai Municipal Xinlu Normal School, co-educational. (B) Shanghai Municipal Kindergarten Normal School, exclusively for female students. (2) There is currently no "most historical" normal school in the Shanghai urban area. Perhaps Xinlu Normal School can be considered an old school. It was originally located in Xinlu, Pudong, and is now located at No. 86 Bazilu Road. (3) Normal schools not only waive tuition fees like municipal primary and secondary schools, but also provide meal allowances and dormitory accommodation. (4) Transfer students entering the third year of normal school are limited to those who have completed the second year of normal school. It is unlikely that students with only a junior high school education can pass the transfer exam. (5) Normal school courses are completely different from junior high school courses, so the compilation of textbooks is also completely different. Please review the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education to learn about the differences.

Zhang Si-da asks: I have a friend who loves art and intends to study in Shanghai. I only know that there is the Shanghai Art College on Caishi Road, but I do not know where the former Xinhua Art College has moved to. Are there any other art schools in Shanghai? I hope you can spare some time to provide detailed addresses. Thank you!

Editor answers: There is currently only one art college in Shanghai, the Shanghai Art College. The Xinhua Art College was closed after the August 13th Incident [Battle of Shanghai] and there has been no news of its re-establishment.
