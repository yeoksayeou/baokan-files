### Frequent Political Activities in the Capital, Broad Exchange and Negotiation of Opinions, President Song Meets Zhou Enlai for the First Time

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Marshal Ma departed from Beijing by plane to Xun on the morning of the 23rd, then proceeded to Guling. Ambassador Stuart will be responsible for negotiations in Beijing. Furthermore, Minister Bai of the Ministry of National Defense visited Marshal Ma at 6 PM on the 22nd, discussing matters for nearly an hour before departing. The Ambassador then visited Marshal Ma again at 7 PM, and they dined together.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] On the 22nd, political activities in Beijing were frequent. The government, the Communist Party, and the American side engaged in cyclical meetings, all striving to open the door to peaceful negotiations. Mr. Fu Jingbo, Ambassador Stuart's personal advisor, told reporters that current contacts are merely a broad exchange of opinions on principles and procedures for negotiation, with no progress made. This serious situation of unresolved entanglement is causing the intermediaries a great headache. When formal negotiations can resume is currently difficult to predict. The government will replace President Song Ziwen as the negotiation representative. On the 22nd, Mr. Song frequently met with American and Communist Party figures, indicating this possibility. It is said that Chairman Chiang already favored Mr. Song while at Guling. Marshal Ma received Mr. Song at his residence on Ninghai Road at 9 AM on the 22nd, and they talked for an hour before Mr. Song departed. The Ambassador spent almost his entire day, from morning to night, in political talks. At 9:30 AM, he met with Minister Yu Dawei at the embassy. At 12 PM, he visited Marshal Ma and Admiral Cooke. At 4 PM, he met with Zhou Enlai. Another noteworthy meeting was Song Ziwen's first reception of Zhou Enlai at his private residence at 10:30 AM. Song told Zhou that he was acting in a private capacity and not representing the government. Zhou departed at 11:40 AM. In the morning, Yu Dawei had visited President Song to inform him of the details of the recent peace negotiations.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Contact regarding peace negotiations resumed frequently on the 22nd. In terms of form and direction, two differences from the past can be seen: (1) President Song's appearance in the peace negotiation camp indicates the government's urgent desire for peace, willing to use different methods to achieve the goal of peace. As for the Communist side, Zhou Enlai's visit to the Ambassador today was arranged by Wang Bingnan of the Communist Party delegation, who visited the embassy beforehand, reversing the past practice of Marshal Ma and Stuart inviting. This indicates that the Communist Party also wants the Ambassador to continue to act as an intermediary. It is reported that during the Stuart-Zhou meeting on the 22nd, the Ambassador inquired about the Communist Party's broadcast in Zhangjiakou, but Zhou only replied that it was not a general offensive order, but a call for self-defense. Zhou stated on the 22nd that peace must ultimately be achieved, but it depends on how Stuart and Ma proceed, saying, "Peace is always possible." According to those familiar with the content of the negotiations, Zhou had never made this statement before.

### Minister Bai Issues Statement: Government Still Aims to Restore Peace Through Negotiations

[Reuters, Nanjing, 21st] Minister Bai of the Ministry of National Defense met with reporters this afternoon. When asked if the government considered the broadcast from Zhangjiakou Radio and the editorial in the Yan'an Liberation Daily equivalent to a declaration of war by the Communist Party, Mr. Bai replied, "I personally hope this does not indicate the existence of a state of war. The official attitude in Nanjing is that conflict can still be stopped and peace restored through political negotiations. We are not yet prepared for war." The reporter then asked if the Communist Party expanded the conflict zone and actively prepared for all-out war, would the government still adopt a passive wait-and-see policy, awaiting a peaceful solution? General Bai said, "If we are attacked, we will of course repel them. The situation on the Longhai Line is exactly like this." General Bai could not foresee the KMT and the communists officially declaring war, and said: "We will never let this kind of situation occur, and we don't need to have this situation until our determination to solve all problems through negotiation is eliminated. Every war is initiated by the Communist Party. If we are not attacked, we will never do anything. We have tried our best to avoid continued bloodshed, because China is in urgent need of peace." General Bai said that although Yan'an had issued a mobilization order, the government had not taken any counter-measures. He did not know that the National Army had new actions to deal with the overall offensive. The reporter then asked that, if it reached the decisive stage, could the government army defeat the Communist army? General Bai said: "Up to now, I have not estimated how long it will take for the National Army to defeat the Communist Army." General Bai emphatically stated that "Chairman Chiang and the central government, despite the military provocations of the Communist Party, still do not give up the pacification policy. We will find ways to reconcile with the Communist Party, and I think that this goal can be achieved with the help of Marshal Ma." Regarding the rumor that the government had issued an ultimatum to the Communist Party, informing them that if they did not abandon the siege of Datong, the National Army would attack Yan'an and Zhangjiakou, General Bai said he had not received accurate information. He confirmed Minister Peng Xuepei's statement that the Communist Army had gathered all its forces and was approaching the outskirts of Datong.

### Expanding Government Structure

No Concrete Measures Yet Discussed [Our Guling Dispatch, 22nd] Chen Lifu said: Expanding the government structure and recruiting various parties have not been discussed in concrete terms.

### Sun Liren Assumes Two New Positions in Changchun

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 21st] Sun Liren took office today as the Commander of the Fourth Pacification Zone and the Commander of the Changchun Garrison. He met with reporters from Changchun at his resting place at 11:30 AM. It is said that the Communist army's order to launch a comprehensive disturbance is a manifestation of doing many unjust things. However, as of the time of the conversation, there was no major conflict in the Northeast. Mr. Sun passed through Changchun eighteen years ago when he returned from abroad, so this pacification period is actually his second time to Changchun. Mr. Sun is alert and determined, and believes that the overall situation is extremely optimistic.

The planned roadside protection villages will be directed by this agency.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] On the evening of the 23rd, the reporter visited Yu Dawei and asked whether there was any change in the peace talks. Yu said that the government was determined to seek peace, but today the flames of war are raging, and the Communist Party cannot disclaim its responsibility. Yu also talked about the restoration of transportation. He briefly stated that, in addition to the destroyed parts north of the Longhai Line that urgently need to be restored but cannot be started, the railways in the Jinghu area and the Yuehan Road are waiting to be reorganized, and the Tianlan and Chengyu new roads are also waiting to be built.

[Our Jiangdu Dispatch, 22nd] After the Communist Party issued a general mobilization order, the situation in northern Jiangsu became increasingly tense, and a major war may break out at any time.

[Our Jiangdu Dispatch, 22nd] Xiannvmiao, 22nd Dispatch, the reporter accompanied the army to Xiannvmiao today for inspection. This place is located on the Yangtai Road, 18 li from Yangzhou and 18 li from Shaobo, which is still occupied by the Communist Army.

### He Long Leads Troops to Reinforce Datong, War in Shanxi Fully Unfolds, Communist Army Moves Frequently in Liaoning, Jehol, Hebei, and Shandong

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 22nd] The full-scale war in Shanxi Province has unfolded. After the Communist Army of Shanxi occupied Hongdong and Zhao counties, it continued to attack Linfen. Linfen is now in urgent condition. The Communist Army in the northern section of the Tongpu Railway is also advancing south from Xinzhou, having approached Taiyuan. There are fierce battles everywhere on the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Road today. Datong in northern Shanxi is also in a tight situation. He Long personally led the First Field Brigade and a tank team of about 10,000 people from Fengzhen to Dalan Village, northwest of Datong, to reinforce.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 22nd] Transportation circles report that west of the northern section of the Pinghan Road, the Communist Army has recently dispatched a large number of troops towards Zhangjiakou and Jehol, seemingly preparing for Zheng Jiemin's memorandum to the Communist Party on behalf of the Military Mediation Department, which stated that in order to support the self-defense war in Datong, the National Army had the freedom to take action against Zhangjiakou, Chengde, and Yan'an.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 22nd] Negotiations for a temporary truce have not yet reached an agreement. The Taiyuan Central Group of the Military Mediation Department invited representatives of the commanders of both sides to hold a joint meeting for two hours on the afternoon of the 21st, with the Datong issue still being the focus of the dispute. In order to break this deadlock, the group specially requested instructions from the Beiping Military Mediation Department.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 21st] The atmosphere of war is getting stronger and stronger. Reporters have contacted both the government and the Communist Party, and both sides have expressed this view. Following the two major battlefields of Datong and Central Plains, the next major battlefield will be Jehol. Both sides have made considerable preparations. In order to eliminate this unexploded war invisibly, the Military Mediation Department has made efforts. This is the joint meeting of the three shaking Jehol groups and the highest commanders of the KMT and the Communist armies, although the three members of the Military Mediation Department once again instructed the group to mediate, and the group also convened a preparatory meeting again on the 18th, but both were fruitless, and this unsuccessful meeting will become an excuse for the responsibility of war.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 21st] Due to the silence of the negotiations in Nanjing and Guling, coupled with the Communist Army's constant destruction of roads in eastern Jehol and western Liaoning, as well as the frequent movements of the Communist Army in the Jilin-Harbin area, the situation in the Northeast, which had been calm for many days, has become heavy again. Since coming to Shenyang, Dong Guolai has visited Du Yuming several times to report on the parallel process. It is reported that Zheng will move from Changchun to a certain place in western Liaoning, but will still go to Changchun within days. Du is recuperating due to a minor illness and will travel later. (2) According to Zhao Jiaxiang, the actions of the Communist Army in recent days are expected after the start of the Green Yarn Curtain. If the National Army is invaded, it will definitely be retaliated against.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 22nd] Autumn is getting stronger in the north; war opportunities are revealed everywhere in the valleys of the Northeast and Hebei and Shanxi. There was a fierce battle in Huoxian, Shanxi Province on the 21st. The Communist Army gathered in the northeastern area of Linyi is preparing to attack the county seat. The Communist Army in Hebei Province, the Central Hebei and Southern Hebei military regions are also actively expanding their troops, and prohibit the export of food and daily necessities from the liberated areas. The Communist Army in Gaoyi, Gaocheng, Lecheng, Huolu and Jingxing in southern Hebei has increased. The Shijiazhuang area has increased by more than 23,000 people. The cloud of sorrow covers the sun, and startled wild geese are everywhere. The hope of peace, in the sound of Yan'an's order to mobilize, has scattered like floating smoke.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The Communist Army has gathered 50,000 troops on both sides of the Jiaozhou River east of Gaomi City, Shandong, and its main force controls the east-west area of Gaomi on the Jiaoji Road, attempting to block the government's restoration work on the road and supporting the encirclement and attack of Qingdao by the Communist Army.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 22nd] Baoding Telephone The news of the Communist Army's general mobilization is spreading. The Communist Army in central Hebei has become active again. The Communist Party leaders in the central Hebei military region have gradually concentrated in Gaoyang. It is said that a meeting is being held to decide on new actions. At the same time, the Communist Army in Gaoyang is mobilizing civilians to build airfields and ordnance factories and ammunition depots. The main equipment is transported from the Communist Army's industrial company in Fuping.

### Communist Army Reported to Use Poison Gas to Attack Datong

[Reuters, Nanjing, 22nd] The news that the Communist Army used poison gas to attack Xialin Village (translation, about one mile from the city) on the outskirts of Datong is probably the biggest condemnation in the propaganda war after the announcement of mobilization.

### Northeastern Redemption of Red Tickets Extended in Various Places

Commander-in-Chief Gu Zhutong will leave Kunming and return to Nanjing within the next week.

### Amidst the CCP's Call for Mobilization, the Activities of Communist Armies Inside and Outside the Pass, the Communist Army in North China Divided into Three Major Forces

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 22nd] Amidst the Communist Party's call for general mobilization for war, a certain military authority here who is familiar with the overall dynamics of the Communist Army today discussed the deployment and activities of the Communist Army inside and outside the pass. He said that the Communist Party's regular army has a total of about 800,000 troops. Except for about 450,000 of them deployed outside the pass, the rest are scattered in various provinces in North China. After the battle of Siping, the Communist Army outside the pass was severely damaged. Since then, it has actively supplemented and reorganized its troops to restore its original strength. About 17 brigades are stationed in Jehol. The Communist Army in the Chifeng-Chengde area will take action. Although the Military Mediation Department has instructed the three Jehol groups to convene a meeting of the highest commanders of the KMT and the Communist armies, it will ultimately be fruitless. As for whether the Northeast can continue to maintain its rough state of peace, it is not dared to say. As for the Communist Army in North China, it can be divided into three major forces. One is Liu Bocheng's troops of about 170,000 people, based in the Taihang Mountains, with its headquarters located in Baiyan Village near Wu'an. The current activity is the offensive along the 300-li Longhai Road, but it has obviously been frustrated. The second is He Long's troops of about 56,000 people, based in northern Shanxi, with its headquarters located in Fengzhen. The current activity is the siege of Datong, which seems to be quite successful, but the consequences are not dared to be predicted. The third is Chen Yi's troops, based in eastern Shandong, with its headquarters in Linyi (one said it has been moved), about 150,000 people. The main activity now is in northern Jiangsu. In addition, there is Nie Rongzhen's troops of about 30,000 people, based in Zhangjiakou, and its main task is to maintain the corridor between Chahar-Suiyuan and the Northeast, while defending Fu Zuoyi's eastward expansion. However, a part of it has recently moved to Yingxian area south of Datong, seemingly trying to attack Datong with He Long. Judging from this, except for the Northeast, all the Communist Army inside the pass has been launched. As for the Communist Army's so-called regular army of 1.2 million and militia of 2 million, it is actually an exaggerated propaganda. Although the militia has a considerable number, they are all vulnerable. If the Communist Army has airplanes, there will be no more than 20.

### Current Movements

Nanjing Telegram Song Xilian, Chief of Staff of the Northwest Travel Headquarters, arrived in Nanjing by China Airlines plane from Lanzhou on the 21st.

Changsha Telegram Wang Dongyuan, Chairman of Hunan, went to Hankou the night before last and transferred to Guling.

"Guling, 22nd dispatch" After the foreign exchange adjustment, Chairman Chiang personally instructed relevant authorities to carefully prevent fluctuations in gold prices and essential daily necessities due to the adjustment. He also personally instructed the Executive Yuan to pay attention to containment after gold price fluctuations, demonstrating a glimpse of the Chairman's concern. It is said that the Chairman had reviewed gold price reports from various regions from the 19th to the 22nd. According to those close to the Chairman, gold prices are unlikely to fluctuate again.

[Our Nanjing, 22nd Dispatch] The Executive Yuan convened a temporary emergency meeting at 7:00 PM on the 22nd, presided over by President Soong. Over 20 heads of ministries and commissions attended, including Minister Bai Chongxi of the Ministry of National Defense, Standing Committee Member Chen Guofu, Minister Yu Hongjun of the Ministry of Finance, etc. The meeting concluded at 11:30 PM.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd Dispatch] President Soong Ziwen convened over ten heads of ministries and commissions at the Yuan at 7:00 AM on the 22nd for discussions. It is said that financial and commodity price issues were discussed.

[Our Hankou, 22nd Dispatch] After the conclusion of the Hankou Municipal Council, a reception was held for the heads of various agencies. During the banquet, Chairman Wan addressed the issue of commodity prices after the foreign exchange rate increase, stating that the purpose of raising the foreign exchange rate was to support domestic industry and commerce, and domestically produced goods should not dig their own graves by raising prices again. The government is determined to crack down on speculative merchants, and hopes that public representatives will report them at any time.

[Our Nanjing, 22nd Dispatch] A responsible person from the Ministry of Food stated that the government attaches great importance to the impact on grain prices after the exchange rate adjustment. President Soong had discussed this matter with Minister Xu while in Shanghai. The government currently has a large amount of grain on hand, which can be used as necessary. After the exchange rate adjustment, grain prices in various regions have not fluctuated greatly. The new harvest has already begun, and harvests in various regions are good. In addition, relief rice and purchases from overseas are arriving continuously, so there are no major concerns about future grain prices. Regarding the grain situation in Nanjing and Shanghai, the responsible person stated optimistically that the price of Wuhu rice near the capital is only over 20,000 per dan, and Shanghai's reserves are also abundant. Furthermore, foreign rice imports are first transported to that area, so there is no need to worry about rice prices.

[Our Nanjing, 22nd Dispatch] Rice prices in Nanjing fell sharply on the 21st due to excessive supply, and there was a phenomenon of "sellers but no buyers" for a time. On the 22nd, about 3,400 dan arrived, which is still rare. The price for early rice was 40,000, and for mid-season rice, 39,000. People's minds are very settled.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 22nd Dispatch] Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Pan Xulun stated that in order to revive the national economy, the government will increase import tariffs in the near future. The new tariff rates will be implemented on a scheduled basis after being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is also learned that the government may negotiate with the United States to exempt taxes on Chinese exports to encourage the export of Chinese goods to the United States.

[Central News Agency, Guling, 22nd Dispatch] Finance Minister Yu Hongjun is scheduled to come to Guling from Nanjing on the 23rd.

### The Government Attaches Importance to Agricultural Development Work, China and the United States Implement Agricultural Technology Cooperation, Zou Bingwen Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Inspection Experiences

[Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch] The Sino-American Agricultural Technical Cooperation Team has already moved from North China and Northeast China to West China and South China for inspection. Dr. Zou Bingwen, the leader of the team, returned to Nanjing ahead of schedule due to other important matters. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and met with reporters to discuss: The team, organized by Sino-American agricultural technology experts, departed from Nanjing in early July for inspection. Initially, they went to Beiping to visit the enemy-operated North China Agricultural Experiment Station, the Shijiazhuang Agricultural Experiment Branch, and other agricultural management institutions and equipment; then to Tianjin to visit the enemy-operated reclamation projects near Junliangcheng and to discuss the promotion of exports of domestic agricultural products with export merchants. On the 5th, they departed from Tianjin to Changli to visit the enemy-operated fruit tree business. On the 10th, they arrived in Shenyang to visit the enemy-operated Agricultural Science University and the major manufacturing companies of enemy-operated agricultural tools, disease prevention medicines, and serums. On the 11th, they arrived in Changchun to visit the Agricultural Development Department, the Continental Scientific Research Institute, and various agricultural companies established by the enemy in Manchuria, and had detailed discussions with local agricultural technicians (including Japanese technicians). On the 13th, they arrived in Gongzhuling to visit the enemy-operated Northeast Agricultural Experiment Factory, and had brief discussions with Japanese technicians who had not yet returned to their home country. Then they returned to Beiping from Gongzhuling and went to Xi'an. I then returned to Shanghai on behalf of the team. The team affairs are now presided over by Mr. Hutchison, the American team leader, and Mr. Shen Zonghan, our team deputy leader. They will go from Xi'an to Chengdu, Hankou, Guangzhou, Liuzhou, Taiwan, Zhejiang and other places for inspection. I plan to go to Hankou or Guangzhou to participate on September 2. The team is scheduled to complete the inspection by October, and will spend six weeks after returning to Nanjing to compile the entire inspection report. The time allocation is: two weeks to complete the first draft, two weeks to discuss the content with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and relevant agencies, and the final two weeks to revise the first draft as the final report. The report content is divided into three parts: (1) China's agricultural construction plan, (2) Improvement plan for special agricultural products, (3) Sino-American agricultural cooperation plan, for the reference of the authorities in implementing policies. Ten American agricultural experts participating in the team's inspection are scheduled to leave China on November 15 and return to their country to report on their duties. In addition, the team also sent four small groups of personnel to inspect the special agricultural product business of tea, silk, tung oil, and wool, and will also complete the task in the shortest period of time.

Impressions of This Trip

Regarding the impressions of this trip, Mr. Zou stated: The various agricultural institutions operated by Japan in North China and Northeast China, although their intentions were unpleasant, yet their technical achievements are worthy of reference and application by our country, which is known as an agricultural nation. From all aspects of the enemy-operated agricultural institutions, we deeply feel that the Japanese government can fully understand the importance of agricultural construction, is very determined to improve agriculture, and has a relatively reasonable organization, appropriate personnel, and sufficient funding. Therefore, in the past 30 years, under the economic aggression in Northeast China and in North China in the past few years, the achievements in operating agriculture have been considerable. According to the survey, the Japanese government spent more than 10 million Japanese yen annually on agricultural research in North China, and the technicians sent to China were all well-known experts in the country, with generous treatment and an average service life of more than 20 years (the head of the agricultural experiment station was treated as a specially appointed official), so whether it is animal husbandry, forestry, or agricultural products, all have great achievements. Mr. Zou continued: Now our government also deeply feels the importance of agricultural construction, and hopes that from now on, there will also be appropriate organization, personnel, and funding to engage in agricultural improvement and stabilize the lives of farmers. I dare to assert that the future achievements will certainly not be inferior to the achievements of Japan's operation in Northeast China in the past 30 years. Finally, Mr. Zou told reporters: Because I need to participate in the report prepared by the Sino-American Agricultural Technical Cooperation Team, I will not be able to attend the second annual meeting of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization recently held in Denmark. I have now agreed with Minister Zhou to change to Xie Jiasheng as the representative to attend, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is submitting a request for approval.

### The Beiping-Shenyang Train Did Not Depart Yesterday

### Chu Minyi, a Traitor, Executed by Firing Squad This Morning; Application for Retrial Rejected by the Jiangsu High Court

[Our Suzhou, 22nd Dispatch] After Chu Minyi, a traitor, applied for a retrial again, and was rejected by the collegial panel of the Second Criminal Division of the Jiangsu High Court, consisting of Presiding Judge Kong Rongzhao, Judge Shen Zhaoming, and Judge Ling Fuyao, the reporter specifically approached Han Qi, Chief Prosecutor of the Jiangsu High Prosecutor's Office, to inquire about the date of execution. He was told that it has now been decided to carry it out at 8:00 AM on the 23rd at the execution ground of the Third Prison at Shizikou. Prosecutor Li Shudong will still be appointed as the supervising officer.

[Our Suzhou, 22nd Dispatch] After Chu Minyi, a traitor, applied for a retrial, and was rejected by the Supreme Court, his wife Dong Shunzhen applied for a retrial again, hoping to die for her husband. On the morning of the 22nd, the Suzhou High Court issued a ruling No. 11 on retrial, ruling that Chen Shunzhen's application for a retrial should be rejected. The reasons are recorded as follows: According to Article 413, paragraph 1, item 6 of the Criminal Procedure Law applicable to the special criminal case procedure in the first item of Article 1 of the Special Criminal Case Procedure Regulations, the application for a retrial based on the discovery of definite new evidence is limited to the extent that it is sufficient to recognize that the person who has been sentenced should be acquitted, dismissed, exempted from punishment, or sentenced to a lighter crime than the original judgment. It is not possible to merely criticize the sentencing of the original final judgment as a reason for applying for a retrial. The legal intention is very clear. In this case, the defendant Chu Minyi, because of the traitor case, was judged by this court in accordance with Article 2, paragraph 1, item 1 of the Punishment of Traitors Regulations, and found guilty of colluding with the enemy to plot against the country, and sentenced to death, and approved by the Supreme Court for review. The applicant, namely the defendant's wife Chu Chen Shunzhen, is applying for a retrial this time, only on the grounds that "the defendant followed the National Father and ran for the revolution for many years. This time, after the enemy country surrendered, he was able to reform and prepare to hand over and maintain security, and should be sentenced leniently. Furthermore, Shen Songting of the former National Institute of Technology, Wu Chunjiang of Jinling Middle School, students of the National Nanjing Temporary Middle School, Xi Guansheng of Shanghai Guanshengyuan, and the Jiading Houlun Silk Cocoon Factory have all presented facts that prove that the defendant is beneficial to the people, which can also be used as new evidence for applying for a retrial." The court found that the defendant's crime of colluding with the enemy to plot against the country was certain and the circumstances were serious. The original final judgment has been explained in detail. The fact that the defendant followed the National Father and ran for the revolution for many years, and maintained security in Guangdong after the enemy country surrendered to wait for the takeover, even if it is newly discovered evidence, in law, there is no reason for which he should be acquitted, dismissed, exempted from punishment, or sentenced to a crime lighter than that detailed in the original judgment, that is, it clearly does not affect the establishment of the defendant's crime of colluding with the enemy to plot against the country. Especially for the so-called acts of the defendant in the puppet office that were beneficial to the people, even if the evidence is certain, Article 3, paragraph 1 of the Regulations on Handling Traitor Cases only stipulates that the sentence may be reduced, but not necessarily. It is still a matter of judicial discretion and falls within the jurisdiction of the court. According to the previous explanation, it is also not a reason that the party concerned can use to apply for a retrial, and should be rejected.

Editorial

### Reflections on Pu Yi's Testimony in Tokyo

Since the Tokyo International Tribunal was established in May and began trying Japanese war criminals, there have been many remarkable scenes. However, what has attracted the attention of the general public more than anything else so far is the testimony of the puppet emperor Pu Yi. Pu Yi's testimony in the court was frank and straightforward. Although it fully demonstrated his cowardice and desire to survive, upon careful examination of his testimony, we can see that his frank statements about the Japanese invaders' deliberate aggression against China and the various threats he faced during his tenure as a puppet emperor serve as powerful evidence for confirming and executing the Japanese war criminals. Pu Yi's testimony in the Tokyo court is still ongoing and has not yet concluded, but based on the parts he has already testified to, we would like to express our views as follows:

First, Japan's invasion of China was a long-planned and premeditated action. Its occupation of the Northeast was not an accidental event. The masterminds behind it were the Japanese militarists, especially the Kwantung Army in the Northeast at the time. Pu Yi's testimony in the Tokyo International Tribunal further proves this point. He said: "At that time, the commander of the Kwantung Army, Shigeru Honjo, sent Staff Officer Colonel Seishiro Itagaki to inform me that Zhang Xueliang's regime in the three northeastern provinces was arbitrarily imposing harsh taxes and causing suffering to the people, and that Japan's vested interests were also being infringed upon. Therefore, they planned to drive out the warlords, eliminate the communists, and establish a new country." This shows how the Kwantung Army deliberately destroyed China's unity and launched its invasion of China. Honjo, Itagaki, Doihara, and others should be held responsible for the establishment of the puppet "Manchukuo," but the Japanese militarists, despite having different factions, were essentially a unified whole, so even those who did not directly participate in the "Manchurian Incident" should also bear joint responsibility. Due to Pu Yi's frank testimony, the Japanese militarists' deliberate aggression against China is undeniably guilty. If the Japanese war criminals currently on trial in Tokyo are sentenced to death by the International Tribunal, it would be a just and legitimate act.

Second, Pu Yi's status as a puppet and a pathetic imbecile is vividly depicted in his own testimony. Because he could not "avoid danger," and because he was afraid of death and could not consider the greater good, he fully demonstrated his imbecilic nature. Although he himself was only a puppet and could not be held directly responsible for Japan's rule over the Northeast and its exploitation, as a citizen of the Republic of China, he willingly became a puppet of the Japanese militarists, undermining the integrity of China's territorial administration. While this may be understandable from an emotional standpoint, it is absolutely unforgivable under the law. His actions should be subject to fair judgment under Chinese law. Therefore, after carefully reading Pu Yi's testimony in the Tokyo International Tribunal, the second thing that comes to mind is that our Ministry of Foreign Affairs should actively negotiate to ensure that Pu Yi and his fellow traitors are returned to Chinese courts for trial.

It has been reported that Pu Yi's appearance in Tokyo to testify was under the custody of the Soviet authorities, and that there was a prior agreement with the U.S. military authorities that he would be returned to the Soviet Union after his testimony. During his time in Tokyo, the Soviet authorities kept Pu Yi under strict surveillance, prohibiting him from speaking to anyone. It is understandable that Pu Yi, as a person awaiting punishment, should have his freedom of movement restricted. However, we find it puzzling that Pu Yi, as a criminal of the Republic of China, should be subject to Chinese law. When the Soviet army entered and occupied the Northeast, they took him into custody and should have extradited him to China afterwards to be brought to justice. According to news agency reports, China hoped to extradite Pu Yi, and the Soviet side had previously agreed but now reserves its position. If the reports are true, it is difficult to understand. We would like to formally inform the Soviet authorities here to extradite Pu Yi to the Chinese courts as soon as possible to be subject to the sanctions of Chinese law.

Pu Yi was the first person to serve as a puppet in the Second World War. Because of Pu Yi's precedent, there were later figures like Wang Jingwei, Chen Gongbo in China, as well as Quisling in Norway and Pétain in France. In the history of the evolution of puppets, Pu Yi is undoubtedly an ancestor. However, when we think of the history of the evolution of puppets, looking at Wang Jingwei, Chen Gongbo, and others after Pu Yi, we cannot help but feel that each generation is worse than the last. Pu Yi was naturally imbecilic and afraid of death. Although his appointment as a puppet constituted a crime, he was a genuine and complete puppet, so in his own conscience, he must have been filled with distress. He was still able to tell the truth, admitting that he had no freedom, and even when the defense attorney for the war criminals insisted that he accepted the puppet position to avenge the Republic of China and to seek the happiness of the people, he insisted that "this is counter-propaganda." This shows that even as a puppet, he still had a sense of nation and ethnicity in his words. As for figures like Wang Jingwei, after the war of resistance had already begun, the national policy had long been decided, and they were in the rear, never having suffered any pressure, yet they voluntarily withdrew from the war of resistance camp and joined the enemy, directly selling out the country for personal glory and willingly becoming slaves. They cannot be compared to Pu Yi. As for other puppets of lower caliber, they shamelessly served the enemy, and when they were brought to trial under national law, they spouted their traitorous arguments, trying to justify themselves and attempting to shirk responsibility. Compared to Pu Yi's frankness and straightforwardness, they should be ashamed beyond measure!

What we detest even more are those new puppets after Wang Jingwei! If they disregard the public will, betray the interests of the nation, and willingly become slaves to foreigners, this is the interpretation of a puppet. Then it is not difficult for us to imagine who these new puppets are. After the war, the people need stability, and the nation needs an opportunity to recuperate, but these new puppets have violated the will of the people and sold out the interests of the nation, putting up attractive façades on the surface while concealing endless poisons inside. Their lack of freedom and inability to make their own decisions is probably even worse than Pu Yi's. We have seen these puppets who once betrayed the interests of the Chinese nation being purged one by one, and we are confident that these new generations of puppets will eventually be purged in the high tide of the national independence movement.

### US Issues Ultimatum to Yugoslavia: Unprecedented Severity Since Pearl Harbor, Demands Release of US Airmen Within Two Days, Yugoslav Representative Trembles Upon Receiving Ultimatum

[Our Newspaper Comprehensive News] The tense relations between the United States and Yugoslavia can be said to have reached their peak. According to a United Press International dispatch from Washington, the United States issued an ultimatum to Yugoslavia on the 22nd, demanding that all detained airmen from the downed U.S. aircraft be released and sent across the border within 48 hours (i.e., 3:00 AM Greenwich Mean Time Saturday, or 12:00 PM Shanghai time on the same day). Otherwise, the United States "will immediately request a meeting of the United Nations Security Council to take appropriate measures." The ultimatum, in an extremely stern tone, refutes Yugoslavia's claim that this was merely an accidental incident and states that the Yugoslav government acted intentionally and must therefore bear full responsibility for the matter. The ultimatum is filled with indignation and is unprecedented in its severity since the Pearl Harbor incident, accusing Yugoslavia of "blatantly violating international law and the United Nations Charter" and intentionally attacking the U.S. aircraft. It further states that Yugoslavia's explanations are completely untenable and that the American people are outraged.

The ultimatum was issued after Acting Secretary of State Acheson and Secretary of State Byrnes, who is in Paris, had two long-distance telephone conversations across the Atlantic. At 5:00 PM, Acheson invited the Yugoslav Chargé d'Affaires to the United States, Mr. Makajdo, to meet him in his office. After Mr. Makajdo arrived, reporters gathered in front of the office. The two men held a closed-door meeting in the office. Five minutes later, Mr. Makajdo emerged, pale and trembling, and rushed out of the crowd of reporters, saying only, "The State Department can inform you of this matter." It is noteworthy that the United States had just issued a serious protest on Tuesday regarding this matter, and now, without waiting for Yugoslavia's response, has issued an ultimatum. It is widely believed that the United States has made up its mind to fight Yugoslavia to the end to maintain its international reputation.

U.S. Ambassador to Yugoslavia Patterson, accompanied by a military attaché, flew to Gante on the southern Austrian border on the 22nd to confer with Marshal Tito, who is vacationing there. It is widely believed that this will be the first opportunity to obtain Yugoslavia's response to the ultimatum. However, according to a Yugoslav spokesperson on the 22nd, Marshal Tito may reject the demands in the U.S. ultimatum.

### Concerns US International Standing, Byrnes Determined to Force Showdown

According to a United Press International dispatch from Paris, Secretary of State Byrnes is prepared to wager the United States' international standing and success in the peace conference on this matter. Byrnes believes that the outcome of the current peace conference is no longer important, but a showdown with Yugoslavia must be won, because if Yugoslavia can shoot down a U.S. aircraft and get away with it as if nothing happened, the entire military and diplomatic position of the United States will be severely damaged.

According to well-informed sources at the peace conference, during Secretary of State Byrnes' meeting with Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj on Wednesday, Kardelj's attitude was "tough and rude," which made Byrnes feel that the United States' patience with the Yugoslav Tito government had reached its limit, and a stern ultimatum had to be issued. As time gradually passes, the tension around the world is also increasing. If Yugoslavia does not provide a satisfactory response after the 48-hour deadline, the matter will be urgently handled by the Security Council.

### Britain and Soviet Union Remain Silent

According to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 22nd, the evening newspapers reported yesterday that Foreign Secretary Bevin is expected to meet with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Kardelj in Paris today to inform him that "British-Yugoslav relations will be severely damaged if President Tito continues to cause trouble." However, there has been no response from the British government regarding the U.S. ultimatum to Yugoslavia.

Moreover, Moscow newspapers have published reports on the dispute between the United States and Yugoslavia, but without comment.

The Turkish reply to the Soviet Union was also delivered to the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Turkey on the 22nd, firmly stating that it could not accept the Soviet Union's proposal to have only Black Sea countries participate in new negotiations. The Turkish government also absolutely rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to jointly defend the straits with Turkey, but agreed to convene an international conference with relevant allied countries to discuss the matter. It is said that the Turkish reply was drafted after consultation with the British and American ambassadors.

### Soviet Union and Norway Establish Border Agreement

[United Press International, Oslo, 21st] The Norwegian Foreign Ministry announced today that the Norwegian delegation, which went to Moscow in early August, has reached a border agreement with the Soviet Union. Before the war, Norway bordered Finland. Since the Soviet Union annexed the Petsamo region, Norway has become a neighbor of the Soviet Union.

### Switzerland and Soviet Union Restore Diplomatic Relations

### Soviets Use German Factories to Manufacture New Weapons

[Reuters Berlin, 21st] Extremely reliable sources from the Soviet occupation zone in Berlin claim that the Soviet Union, together with German technicians, is stepping up the manufacture of new-style V-weapons, special jet-propelled aircraft, rockets, and other heavy weapons in several German armaments factories. At least six factories are engaged in this manufacturing. Although the Soviet Union does not allow allied forces to investigate its armaments factories, it is known that the Siemens factory in Berlin, the Telefunken-Wolfshagen Nitschasenwiek factory, and the Kranenbudingen factory are all manufacturing various parts for the latest V-weapons. The Madge branch of the Krupp factory is manufacturing heavy weapons for shipment to the Soviet Union. The Nata oil factory near Meissenburg in Saxony province is manufacturing fuel for jet-propelled aircraft, but the production of this fuel is currently not very high.

### Soviet Cruiser Arrives in Black Sea Port, Strengthening Psychological Warfare Against Turkey

[United Press International, London, 22nd] According to an exchange of telegrams" published today, Marshal Zhukov, commander of the Soviet forces in the Odessa military district, and his staff have arrived in the Romanian Black Sea port of Constanta aboard a Soviet cruiser. This trip marks the beginning of a tour of the Soviet troops stationed in Romania and Bulgaria and also strengthens the psychological warfare against Turkey.

### Nine US Warships Visit Portugal as Base Negotiations Take Sharp Turn

[Our Newspaper Report] A broadcast from Paris on the 22nd: The United States' latest giant aircraft carrier, the USS Roosevelt, arrived in the Strait of Gibraltar on the 22nd.

[Reuters Lisbon, 21st] As the United States and Portugal formally negotiate the long-term lease of the Azores Islands to the United States as military and air bases, eight U.S. warships, led by the aircraft carrier USS Roosevelt, have arrived here for a friendly visit. It is believed that this move may lead to a more positive turn in the U.S.-Portuguese negotiations. Two U.S. special negotiating representatives, Mr. Coulberson, head of the West European Division of the State Department, and Major General Rude, commander of the U.S. Army Atlantic Air Transport Group, have been in discussions here since July 14, hoping to achieve a satisfactory resolution to the Azores base issue. When the U.S. warships arrived here last Friday, the negotiations were gradually coming to a standstill. The main difficulty lies in the Salazar government's unwillingness to take any action that would undermine the sovereignty of any part of the Portuguese Empire, as well as the safety of the Portuguese people in future wars. It seems that the visit of the U.S. warships has accomplished the following results: (1) To give the Portuguese people a new understanding of aviation; (2) To promote the feelings of the United States and Portugal; (3) To make the Portuguese people understand the importance of the base; (4) It can give the Portuguese people some security guarantee.

### Mountain of Treaty Amendment Proposals to be Reviewed Soon; Connally Arrived in Paris Yesterday Afternoon; Rumor of Soviet Request for UN General Assembly Postponement

[Our Newspaper Comprehensive Report] According to the Associated Press: Various committees of the peace conference are likely to begin work on the afternoon of the 22nd to review the draft treaty and amendments proposed by various parties. The plenary session will be held in the morning to allow the 21 member states to express their views on the opinions presented by the six non-member states on the previous day. Greece's demand for a response to Albania's accusations is almost inevitable, and Austria's request to reclaim South Tyrol may cause heated debate. Therefore, whether the committees will have enough time to begin substantive work remains a question. According to the United Press: (1) The Secretariat announced on the morning of the 22nd that it had received 250 basic amendments from the delegations of the member states. (2) The foreign ministers' representatives have 26 major points of contention regarding the content of the treaty. (3) The draft treaty for the five countries consists of 223 articles and countless clauses, and the counter-proposals submitted in the memoranda of the five defeated countries are likely to exceed one hundred. It is expected that the discussion of the various amendments will take a long time, so the duration of the peace conference cannot be predicted. It is rumored that Molotov has sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Lie requesting that the UN General Assembly, originally scheduled for September, be postponed to January next year, but this has not yet been confirmed.

Our newspaper listened to Paris radio: After the plenary session of the peace conference on the 22nd, US Secretary of State Byrnes left the venue shortly thereafter, accompanied by Mr. Bohlen, Advisor on Eastern European Affairs of the State Department. The two conducted a detailed review of the Yugoslav issue. This shows that the United States attaches greater importance to the above issues than to the review of the treaty.

In other news, US Senator Connally arrived in Paris at 1:00 PM on the 22nd.

### South Africa Demands Right to Speak on Disposal of Italian Territories

According to Reuters: South African Prime Minister Smuts demanded the right to speak at the peace conference on the 21st regarding the disposal of Italian colonies. He said that South Africa had used its manpower and resources to liberate Italy's African colonies, so South Africa's opinions must be sought before deciding to transfer the issue to the UN organization for resolution. Representatives of Britain and its dominions attending the peace conference on the 21st held a meeting under the chairmanship of Bevin, including Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, Representative Clarkston, and New Zealand Representative Mason. Bevin still insisted that if the four powers could not decide the future status of Italian territories, it should be decided by the UN organization, while Smuts believed that the matter should be resolved by the 21 countries. Australian Foreign Minister Evatt stated on the 21st that Australia had proposed several amendments to the draft treaty so that the treaty would be closer to the provisions of the Atlantic Charter and the UN Charter.

### Six Small Countries Present Arguments; Egypt Advocates for Libyan Independence, Austria Opposes Ceding South Tyrol, Iran Asks for Attention to Contributions to Allies

According to the United Press: Representatives of six non-member countries of the non-peace conference attended the peace conference on the 21st and made a series of statements and requests. Representatives of Albania, Egypt, and Austria requested the division of Italian territory, and Albania and Egypt also requested compensation. Mexico and Cuba defended Italy, calling for "common peace."

The key points of the opinions presented by the representatives of Egypt, Cuba, Austria, and Iran are excerpted as follows: Egyptian representative Ghaleb emphasized Egypt's emphasis on general peace, especially the Italian treaty, and also mentioned territorial claims against Italy. If the peace conference agrees, the border between Egypt and Libya will be moved west of Bardia. In this case, the Garabulli Oasis, which was ceded to Italy in 1925, should be assigned to the Solum Plain. In addition, the Egyptian representative also requested that Libya should be established as an independent and autonomous country immediately. Cuban representative Ayala firmly demanded the recognition of the absolutely equal status of all countries attending the peace conference and participating in any international conference in the future, and advocated that all countries of the United Nations should participate in the drafting of the treaty. Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber said that if Austria had been able to obtain assistance from abroad at the time of the German-Austrian merger, it would have been able to resist the German attack. The majority of the Austrian people never supported the goals of German imperialism. We are grateful to the United Nations for liberating Austria. We have no other desire than to engage in peaceful life. As for ceding South Tyrol to Italy, it is unreasonable.

Iranian representative Raisma said that Iran also occupied an important position in the war against the Axis powers, especially in opening the Iranian border and allowing the United Nations to transport supplies to the Soviet Union to support the war, which was a great contribution. Therefore, Iran should have the right to participate in the drafting of the treaty. The Iranian delegation is about to arrive in Paris and will fully explain its views to the peace conference. According to Agence France-Presse, the Iranian delegation is scheduled to depart for Paris on the 22nd, led by State Minister Sababuty.

### Door to British-Egyptian Negotiations Still Not Completely Closed; Joint Statement Issued by Both Sides' Representatives

[Reuters Alexandria, 21st] Egypt's rejection of Britain's proposed amendments to the British-Egyptian treaty, its response has been released tonight. It states: The Egyptian delegation believes that the suggestions and explanations obtained from the British side cannot change their attitude. Therefore, the Egyptian delegation declares that it will still base its decisions on the document submitted to the British side on August 1, 1946. Today, the representatives of both sides held a general discussion, and the result was that both sides could still exchange new ideas to complete the results that are beneficial to both sides.

Another dispatch: Although the British-Egyptian negotiations seem to have reached a stalemate, the joint statement issued by the representatives of both sides today stated: "The door for the exchange of opinions remains open." It is also learned that Egypt still insists on the conditions submitted to London three weeks ago. According to the note submitted by Egypt on August 1, there are three major points: (1) British troops should withdraw from Egypt within one year after the conclusion of the treaty. (2) The joint defense committee established by the treaty should be purely consultative in nature and can only be convened by both parties at the same time, and the note shall not automatically convene meetings. (3) The two governments should negotiate the future of the British-Egyptian Sudan based on the principle of the unification of Sudan and Egypt. Among them, the Sudan issue is the most difficult. Britain does not intend to grant sovereignty to Egypt before Egypt is willing to consider other principles.

### Jerusalem Full of Terror; Jewish Anti-British Sentiment Intensifies

[Our Newspaper Comprehensive Report] Regarding the Palestine issue, all parties are waiting for the round table conference to be held in London to seek a solution. According to Reuters Jerusalem, the Arab Higher Committee is scheduled to meet on the 22nd to discuss the British government's invitation to participate in the London conference. It is rumored that the committee may request that former Jerusalem Mufti Hussein be sent as the head of the Arab delegation in the future London conference, but British officials have formally stated that if the Arab Higher Committee makes this suggestion, the British side will definitely reject it.

At the same time, the situation in Palestine is currently still tense and chaotic with terror. According to Reuters, Jewish militants distributed leaflets on the streets of Palestine on the 21st, stating that if the 18 Jewish youth terrorists who were previously arrested are executed, then "the streets of Palestine will be stained with British blood."

Our newspaper listened to London radio: In Jerusalem, from morning to noon on the 22nd, military vehicles drove endlessly. Important areas were covered with barbed wire and sandbags. Anonymous notices were found from time to time on the streets, stating that a certain institution building would be attacked, so there were now military and police on strict guard in front of all major buildings. It is reported that there are many British troops stationed in the suburbs. All of this seems to indicate that Jerusalem is on the eve of a storm.

### US Submits Territorial Report to UN Organization; Sets an Example for All Countries Based on the Charter

[United Press New York, 21st] The United States took the lead today in submitting a lengthy report to the UN organization on the situation of its territories and island possessions. Therefore, reports from British territories and the Dutch East Indies and other regions may follow. The government's move is in accordance with the provisions of the Charter, that member states should submit reports on the economic, social, and educational conditions of the people within their territories who have not yet achieved full self-government. The United States reported on the situation of Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Panama Canal Zone, Guam, American Samoa, and the Pacific Islands. According to a spokesman for the British delegation, he had not yet received news from London about drafting the report, but member states were not obliged to submit reports before 1947. UN officials estimate that dependent people around the world living in such non-self-governing territories account for 8% of the total number.

### Czechoslovakia Announces Recognition of Spanish Republican Government

### Hindu-Muslim Clash Again in India; Over Forty Casualties; Chinese Defense Minister Bai Expresses Concern Over Indian Situation

[United Press Bombay, 21st] Hindus and Muslims clashed again today in the provinces of Bihar and Assam, killing four and injuring over twenty. In the province of Bengal, four people were stabbed to death and twelve were injured. Muslim and Hindu leaders today unanimously condemned the bloody riots in Calcutta, while the army and volunteers were clearing the last batch of bodies of the 3,000 victims. The authorities are dredging up food sources. Some observers believe that the riots will not frustrate efforts to form an interim government.

[Agence France-Presse New Delhi, 21st] Congress leader Nehru said today: The Calcutta riots should be the responsibility of the government of Bengal. Not only did the local authorities not take any steps to prevent or stop the riots, they fueled the flames and encouraged the rioters.

[Reuters Nanjing, 21st] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi, one of the 30 million Muslims in China, recently expressed great concern about the bloody riots in Calcutta and believes that although India is in chaos, it can still achieve complete independence and national unity.

### Japanese Civil Code Amended; Reduce Parental Rights; Improve Women's Status

[United Press Tokyo, 22nd] The Japanese government has taken preliminary action to abolish the parental dictatorship system in the family, which has been repeatedly attacked as an obstacle to democracy. In accordance with the rights granted to individuals by the new constitution, the civil code has been amended. The new civil code reduces the power of parents and improves the legal status of women. Women are equal to their husbands and are no longer regarded as appendages of the family. Inheritance was previously limited to passing on to the eldest son, but henceforth parents can choose.

### Siamese Political Situation Complex and Confusing; Rumor of New King's Assassination Untrue; Panomrong's Cabinet Suddenly Resigns

[Reuters Bangkok, 21st] The Siamese Regency today issued a statement formally denying the rumor of the Siamese King's assassination. The Siamese King, who is only eighteen years old, flew to Switzerland by plane on Monday due to health reasons. The police announced that a person who had not been allowed to enter the palace was found at midnight on Sunday, claiming to want to see the king. The person did not carry weapons and was obviously mentally deranged and has been detained.

[United Press Bangkok, 22nd] Siamese Prime Minister Panomrong resigned today because "opponents are conspiring to harm my health and undermine my service to myself and the cabinet." The Siamese King is currently traveling to Switzerland, and Panomrong's sudden resignation is extremely surprising. Local political figures believe that Foreign Minister Chayan Am and Justice Minister Navasava will be ordered to form a new government, both of whom are members of the most powerful Constitutional Party.

### Soviet Union Attempts to Break Through the Straits; The United States and Britain Line Up Behind Turkey; Importance Exceeds Any Issue at the Peace Conference

[United Press New York, 22nd] The noise of the Paris Peace Conference is negligible compared to the conflict between Western countries and the Soviet Union; the current conflict is being conducted behind closed diplomatic doors with classical diplomatic means. The major powers are conducting a war of nerves on one of the world's oldest political issues, the Straits issue. This issue touches on the Soviet Union's greatest ambition for three and a half centuries and is enough to determine control of the Middle East, so its viciousness far exceeds all other issues developing in Paris. Other countries have been negotiating the Straits issue since the early 19th century, and some even before this time. The United States did not act during the First and Second World Wars, but the United States cannot stand idly by in any competition involving the transfer of global power. The Soviet Union has made demands on Turkey, the protector of the Dardanelles Strait. This demand is not acceptable to Turkey or Western countries. The first point of the demand is that the countries of the Black Sea take over the management of the Straits. The second point is that the Soviet Union and Turkey take over the defense of the Straits. The so-called countries of the Black Sea are Bulgaria, the Soviet Union, and Turkey. The first two countries become one, and Turkey seems to be permanently in a minority position in any Straits conference. As for the second point, the Soviet Union will jointly occupy the coast of the Straits with Turkey militarily. If this demand is accepted, it will be equivalent to realizing the dream of successive rulers of the Soviet Union since Peter I three and a half centuries ago. Peter the Great was determined to break through the shackles of land and ice and go directly to warm waters. None of Peter the Great's successors aspired to as much as Stalin does today. The Baltic Sea is now largely in the arms of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union has restored its power in the ice-free ports of Lushun and Dalian in the East. The occupation of the Kuril Islands proves that the Soviet Union has entered the Pacific Ocean, and at present, Soviet forces are heading towards the Mediterranean and Europe.

### Main Reason for US-Soviet Conflict Lies in the Competition for Oil Areas

[Agence France-Presse London, 21st] According to responsible sources, by 1965, the United States will have to import half of its normal gasoline consumption from abroad, which is enough to explain part of the reason for the United States' policy in the Middle East and the Arctic Circle. The US, British, and French forces have lined up behind Turkey to oppose the Soviet Union breaking through the Straits. The United States is preparing to share the responsibility for the peaceful management plan of the Dardanelles Strait, which is still in its early stages. Other countries are concerned about how much the Soviet Union will insist on its demands, how long Stalin is prepared to exert pressure, and whether this move is a showdown or just the beginning of bargaining. The world peace that can be glimpsed in its answers is more than what the Paris Peace Conference has achieved so far. . The production of American synthetic gasoline is not enough for application, so the American government openly supports a certain gasoline company to obtain oil field exploration rights in the Middle East. The United States has expressed special concern about the situation in the Dardanelles Strait, Palestine, and the Middle East. Recently, the United States has taken defensive measures, held naval exercises, and is scheduled to hold exercises in the Arctic region this winter to prevent attacks from Alaska, which can all be explained here. The Soviet Union currently lacks gasoline and is planning to seize the oil fields in Romania and Austria and is trying to obtain oil field exploration rights in northern Iran and the Middle East. In short, the oil field issue has great political importance.

[US News Service Washington, 21st] The US newspapers have supported the suggestions on international cooperation to develop the world's oil resources, which were broadcast by the State Department officials on Saturday night, and urged to take steps to implement them as soon as possible. The Washington Post said: "The State Department official's advocacy of the United Nations to control the development of the world's oil resources is a promising development in American foreign policy. To avoid war, the causes of war must be removed, and the lack of managed competition in the world's oil supply is a potential cause of war."

### Head of Economic Experimental Farm Reported for Using His Authority for Personal Gain and Embezzlement; Complex Insider Story Involves a Wide Range of People

[Our Newspaper News] The takeover work investigation team recently received a secret report accusing Zhang Binzhen, head of the Shanghai Economic Experimental Farm of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, of using his official position to engage in large-scale malfeasance when he took over the Japanese agricultural and forestry farms and livestock farms when victory first came to Shanghai. When the Japanese army was in Shanghai, they had established dozens of agricultural and forestry and animal husbandry units, which were all taken over by Zhang Binzhen at that time. After Zhang took over, he sold the dairy cows. According to the informant: the total number reached more than 1,000, and the dairy cows were replaced; Zhang also divided and sold the land of the farm without authorization. It is verified that Zhang is a confidant of Qian Tianhe, Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, so Qian may also be implicated in this case. According to the informant's report, Zhang Binzhen excluded dissidents and manipulated things, and there were dozens of counts of crimes of embezzlement and corruption. Yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock, Zhang Qingzhen, a member of the investigation team, specially summoned Zhang to the team for questioning for two hours and reviewed the files. It is reported that the inside story of this case is extremely complex and involves a wide range of people. Currently, the investigation team is working hard to collect witnesses and material evidence related to the case to clarify the truth of the entire case.

### Investigation Team Summoned Zhang Binzhen for Questioning Yesterday

In other news: Wu Wangji and Zhang Qingzhen, two members of the investigation team, personally set out at 5:00 PM yesterday to investigate the Sun Tianchang plant case. They inspected Sun's factory on Peikai'er Road, Sun's residence on Beidang Road, and Sun's warehouse on Ximo Road. According to the two members: the evidence of Sun's crimes, such as offering airplanes, is quite solid, but Sun has also presented evidence that is beneficial to him, so the case still needs to be investigated rigorously.

### Hearing of the Wen Lanting Case Postponed to Today; Advance Notices Written Incorrectly; High Court Was Once Tense Yesterday

[Our Newspaper News] The Wen Lanting case was originally scheduled to be heard in the special criminal court inside the Shanghai Prison by the High Court yesterday afternoon.

The court clerk suddenly claimed that the hearing was postponed, and the bailiff said that the hearing was being held. Finally, the court official announced to reporters: The writing on the advance notice was wrong, and the case was actually heard at 3:00 PM today. The hearers all came back empty-handed.

It is also learned that when the hearing starts at 3:00 PM this afternoon, a dozen witnesses will be summoned to the court to testify for Wen.

### Wu Kaisheng Still in the Pose of a Lawyer; Completely Forgetting that He is a Criminal; Holding Law Books, Towels, and Small Fans; Mouth Full of "Defendant So-and-so"

[Our Newspaper News] Wu Kaisheng, the false Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and false Ambassador to Italy, was interrogated by the High Court yesterday. When Wu rebel proposed the case, he was calm and composed, holding a pocket-sized Six Laws Compendium, briefs, towels, and a small fan, just like a lawyer appearing in court. Moreover, when he testified in court, he repeatedly mentioned "Defendant So-and-so," as if he had forgotten that the defendant was himself. The case was originally scheduled to open the debate hearing yesterday, but later, because the defendant had submitted more evidence, the court still needed to investigate, so the debate was postponed to another hearing.

### Xiao Jianqing and Others Proposed Yesterday: Zhou Genyao's Case Has Been Prosecuted

Xiao Jianqing, a native of Zhongshan, Guangdong, is currently 38 years old. During the period of enemy and puppet regimes, he successively served as the chief editor of the puppet *Zhonghua Daily* pictorial, editor of the *Youth Pictorial* run by the puppet Propaganda Department, director-general of the Propaganda Section of the Shanghai Special City Party Department of the puppet Kuomintang, and director of the Shanghai office of the puppet Chongming Special District Public Office. He engaged in distorted propaganda for the enemy and puppet regimes. His younger brother, Xiao Langping, served as assistant editor of the puppet *Youth Pictorial*, and Yang Zhenyuan and Cui Zhongtai were reporters for the same publication. In addition, Xu Teng, the captain of the Hongkou puppet Navy Baojia Youth Corps, and Wang Peiqin, the squad leader, assisted the enemy and puppet regimes in suppressing our anti-Japanese elements. The above-mentioned individuals have been jointly prosecuted by the High Procuratorate. The trial opened at the High Court yesterday afternoon. The defendants' statements were evasive and deceptive. After questioning by the court, the judge ordered the case to be adjourned for further hearing.

Furthermore, Ling Guangyan, who served as a puppet major general brigade commander and other puppet positions for as long as six years, was previously sentenced to twelve years in prison by the High Court. Now the Supreme Court has remanded the case for a retrial. The court hearing was held yesterday afternoon. In addition, the cases of Qi Huichang, chairman of the puppet Soap and Candle Industry Association, and Huang Dayu, a secret agent of the enemy's military police, were also adjourned for further hearing after questioning.

[Further Report] The High Procuratorate has prosecuted one case of suspected traitor Zhou Genyao. In addition, Xu Yuexian was found to have insufficient evidence of guilt and will not be prosecuted.

Zhu Boquan, Former President of Shanghai University

Zhu Boquan, currently 48 years old, is a native of Guizhou Gui Zhu. He studied at New York University and Columbia University in the United States. He successively served as deputy manager of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, manager of the Foreign Exchange Department, chief auditor of the Central Bank, and general manager of the Business Bureau. When the Pacific War broke out, the enemy and puppet regimes occupied the Shanghai concessions and took over the China Industrial Bank, with Zhu serving as chairman of the board. At the same time, he also served as manager of the Silver and Money Industry Joint Reserve, presided over the clearing house, and promoted puppet currency. He also served as a counselor for the puppet Central Reserve Bank, a supervisor of the puppet Central Reserve, and chairman of the Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association. In addition, he held dozens of positions as director and council member in various banks, companies, factories, and firms. Later, he resigned from his position as president of Shanghai University. He was seemingly a prominent figure in the Shanghai financial and industrial circles during the enemy and puppet period. After the victory, he was arrested and tried at the High Court yesterday morning. Zhu was dressed in a white cotton short shirt and trousers, and black shoes. He argued that when the Pacific War broke out, the Japanese army occupied the concessions, and British and American banks were closed. The deposits of Chinese people, including the defendant, were also frozen. Later, through negotiations between the defendant and Zhou Fohai, Qian Daqun, and others with Ke Yuan, the representative of the Ministry of Finance of the enemy stationed in Shanghai, the funds were unfrozen. In order to clarify the case, the court specially summoned Qian Daqun, the former vice president of the puppet Central Reserve Bank, from prison for questioning.

### Taiwanese Traitor Zhang Xuan Arrested and Transferred to Face Justice

Zhang Xuan, a native of Fujian, is 34 years old.

After the victory last autumn, Zhang Xuan fled to Shanghai and hid at 117 Zhongzheng Middle Road. A document from the Taiwan Garrison Headquarters was transferred to the municipal authorities a few days ago.

### The National Merchant Shipping Bureau Adjusts North and South Ocean Shipping Routes: The Shipping Department Assigns Ships to Each Route

[Report from This Newspaper] More than a year has passed since the victory, but land and water transportation has still not recovered. The main reason for this is undoubtedly the heavy burden of military and public transportation, which has hindered commercial transportation. Since its resumption of business, the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been striving to maintain shipping routes, but due to busy dispatching, all plans have not been implemented. Recently, the Shipping Department of the Bureau has reallocated ships to the northern and southern routes. The ships assigned to each route are listed below: South Ocean Route: Hanmin, Yan[something], Zhongkai, and Peiwei will sail, with Guangzhou as the final destination. Shanghai-Fuzhou Route: Deng Keng and Lin Sen will sail. North Ocean Route: Zhixin, Qimei, and Huangxing will sail, with Tianjin as the final destination. The North Ocean Route has been further divided into the Shanghai-Qingdao-Dalian route, and the Shanghai-Qingdao-Tianjin route. Haiji will sail the Qingdao-Dalian route, and Haisu will sail the Qingdao-Tianjin route. In addition, the Shanghai-Taiwan route will be served by Hai Zhe, Hai Kang, and Hai Qian. Cai E, Hai Gan, Hai E, Hai Dian, Hai Chuan, and Hai Gui will be dispatched as irregular flights to assist in transportation. The Bureau has assigned one ship to each of its Xiamen, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong branch offices for the convenience of commercial transportation. The ships have also been designated: Hai Wan will be assigned to the Xiamen branch office, Hai Yue will be transferred to the Guangzhou branch office, and Hai Min will be handed over to the Hong Kong branch office. According to the Shipping Department of the Bureau, if there are no obstacles to military and public transportation, and the above-mentioned plan is implemented in earnest, each terminal will be able to operate smoothly.

The People's Steamer Sails to Shanghai and Taiwan

The Minsheng Company's People's Steamer, with a total tonnage of over 4,000 tons, was originally a customs patrol ship.

Li Zhiyi of Ning Shao Company, Yu Shunwei of Sanbei Company, Li Yunliang of Dada Company, Lu Ziyang of Ping'an Company, and more than a dozen shipping industry representatives attended. Before the war, the number of docks was [damaged] significantly. Therefore, since the victory, the number of docks has decreased, and the number of ships has increased, which has had a significant impact on passenger and freight transportation. Moreover, because the arrival time of ships is uncertain, it is impossible to designate inner and outer berths in advance, which has caused a lot of disputes. Regarding the solution, after discussion yesterday, it was considered that the problem was complicated and needed to be studied in detail. It was decided that the shipping industry would draft written solutions and then submit them to the Public Works Bureau for review and approval.

### No Wonder Theft is Rampant at the Docks: The Culprit is a Patrolman from the Port Police Station

[Report from this newspaper] Yu Guoshou, patrolman No. 495 of the Jianghai Customs Port Police Station, and Cao Jiazhang, patrolman No. 216, colluded with Zhang Xuelei, also known as Zhang Wu Kouzi, a foreman, Zhong Haiqing, a carpenter, Yin Cai Tong, a laborer, and Liu Chengwen, Liu Bao, Zhu San Chengzi, Wang Caohe and other thieves who are on the run.

### The Case of the American Pilot Killed in Hong Kong: A Fierce Debate Unfolds in Military Court; The Prosecutor Constantly Asks Sharp Questions; The Court Twice Retires to Confer

[Report from this newspaper] A fierce debate unfolded in the American military court yesterday morning in the case of the murder of Major Hook. The chief prosecutor, Major Dewey, constantly asked sharp questions to Captain Yamaguchi Kyoichi, the defendant acting as a witness, refuting Yamaguchi's claim that the trial of Hook was "fair." Dewey pointed out that Yamaguchi had already read the reports from the military police and the military before the trial began and was deeply convinced of them, so he already had a preconceived notion that Hook was guilty. Yamaguchi, having testified for eight hours over the past two days, was clearly exhausted and his face was very pale. When answering the prosecutor's questions, he mostly avoided the substance. The prosecutor then asked the court to order Yamaguchi to answer "yes" or "no." At this time, the defendant's defense stood up to object, arguing that this was no different from asking someone: "Have you stopped beating your wife?" Because whether the answer is yes or no would be unfavorable. The chief defense counsel, Lieutenant Colonel Bolding, also pointed out that the prosecutor's question was "wasting time" and was "cunning and malicious." Mr. Dewey also retorted with sarcasm. The court retired twice to discuss the debate between the two sides, and finally neither side was favored. The requests of both sides were granted, and Yamaguchi was ordered to testify about the manifestation of so-called "fairness" and whether the verdict was based solely on the military's report. Finally, Yamaguchi admitted that when the decision was made by the collegial panel, since the other judges all thought Hook was guilty, he really had no right to acquit him.

### Rong Hongyuan, Age Thirteen: Accused of Embezzlement, Details Unknown, Retrial

[Report from this newspaper] Rong Er'er, son of Rong Desheng, and his nephew Rong Hongyuan (son of Rong Zongjing), are being sued by their in-law Ding Ziren for embezzlement. The plaintiff requested Rong Desheng to be summoned at the retrial in the Criminal Court 4 of the local court yesterday morning. Rong Er'ren is currently in the United States, and only Rong Hongyuan attended the court to be questioned. Ding stated to the court that in 1919, he and Rong Desheng and Rong Zongjing jointly took over the Hengchangyuan Yarn Factory on Yichang Road and renamed it the Shenxin No. 2 Factory. At that time, the total capital was 500,000 yuan, with the Rong brothers contributing 200,000 yuan each and himself contributing 100,000 yuan. He also served as the general manager. Later, due to old age and weakness, he handed over the position of general manager to Rong Hongyuan, and Rong Er'ren served as the factory affairs manager. After they took over, they gradually embezzled his share capital and hid the original capital account books. He then presented the Shenxin No. 2 Factory's monthly report and year-end ledger as evidence. Zhang Lichuan, the accountant of the factory in 1919, and Zhu Xianfang, the factory director in 1927, testified that Ding did indeed own one-fifth of the share capital on the capital book. Rong Hongyuan said in response: "In 1919, I was only thirteen years old, so I did not know the details at that time. Later, because the factory suffered heavy losses, it was mortgaged to others. After it was recovered, I took over as general manager, but I did not know that Ding had shares in it. If he does have shares, he should be given his share." The court believed that it would be better to settle the case through reconciliation, so it advised the parties to try to reconcile out of court. Since the establishment of criminal liability must first be based on a lawsuit to confirm the equity in the civil court, the court announced that the trial would be suspended and the plaintiff would first file a lawsuit in the civil court. The embezzlement part will not be processed for the time being.

### A Brutal Parricide: A Horrific Matricide Occurs in Miaohang

A horrific matricide occurred suddenly in Miaohang Town, Jiangwan. Just two weeks after the first "August 8th" Father's Day, when people with social conscience are actively promoting the restoration of filial piety, the sudden news of this great moral catastrophe causes concern that the social atmosphere is deteriorating and beyond saving.

His younger brother, Yinqian, and he are both married and have separated. The family only has two or three mu of thin land. The younger brother is diligent and works in the rice industry. His mother also relies on him for support. The elder brother, Jinqian, is usually idle and does not engage in proper work. His mother loves her son deeply and still lives with her eldest son, working in the fields all day long, taking care of household affairs, and helping him solve the problem of food and clothing. Unexpectedly, not only did this fail to encourage her son to wake up, but she was often abused. The sound of her son beating and scolding his mother spread throughout the village and was despised by the neighbors long ago. At 8:00 PM on the 21st, Liu Tangshi returned from drawing water in the fields. Jinqian also returned at the same time and asked if she was going to take a bath. This angered her son, who shouted and scolded her loudly, followed by slapping her cheeks repeatedly. Liu Tangshi cried out for help in extreme pain. Jinqian then picked up a stool and smashed it at her, hitting her vital points repeatedly. She died of her injuries on the spot. The Tangjiaqiao outpost was notified and dispatched police to rush to the scene. The brutal parricide was arrested. He is now being sent to the Jiangwan Branch Bureau and transferred to the Dachang Branch Bureau for interrogation. He will soon be transferred to the court for interrogation.

### Mother and Son Demand Justice: Mistress Hangs Herself in Despair

Chen Zhou, a 42-year-old woman from Taizhou, Jiangbei, met Chen Yushan (50 years old), a man from Nanjing, in August of the 23rd year of the Republic. They fell in love at first sight, and their affection was extraordinary. Soon, they rented a house together at No. 8, Alley B, Lane 130, Jianguo West Road, and jointly set up a beef noodle stall at the entrance of Bugao Alley on Huanlong Road. The business was thriving. The two lived frugally, and their savings at home were substantial. However, Chen already had a legal wife, Wu, in his hometown, who was known for her fiery temper.

### Unprecedented Basketball Boom: Gathering of Heroes from North and South, Capital Air Force Team Arrives in Shanghai on the 26th, Tianjin Huasheng Team to Go South Soon, Philippine Chinese Overseas Qunsheng Team Departs Xiamen for the North

[Our Reporter] The Nanjing Air Force basketball team is on an expedition to Shanghai. It left Beijing for Wuxi on the other day (21st), where it faced off against the Liangxi team. It will go to Suzhou on the 24th for another game and is expected to arrive in this city on the 26th. After resting in Shanghai for one night, it will go to Hangzhou and then return to Shanghai on September 2nd to compete with the local strong teams in about three or four games. In addition to expressing welcome, the Basketball Committee has also invited the Hualian, Shantou, Dongfang, and Renyu teams to compete against them. It is also known that the Philippine Qunsheng and Tianjin Huasheng teams will also come to Shanghai. Therefore, the Air Force team can also compete with them at that time. It is expected that basketball giants from all over the country will gather in Shanghai, and there will be an unprecedented boom. The Air Force basketball team lineup is as follows:

Air Force Lineup: General leader Yi Guorui, instructor and manager Wen Zongyuan, instructor Yang Hanchen, general secretary Yang Shaohua, captain Qu Xingcun, players Liu Zhenyuan, Ge Ke, Zhang Lizhi, Li Xianyue, Su Yinghai, Qin Xunze, Yao Zehua, Wang Helin, Leng Peishu.

Huasheng Coming to Shanghai: The Tianjin Huasheng basketball team has sent a letter to the local Basketball Committee, stating that they plan to come to Shanghai soon. The purpose is also to have an opportunity to observe the Philippine Qunsheng team. The Philippine Qunsheng team has left Xiamen and will arrive in Shanghai in the coming days. According to the above news, at that time, the confrontation between the Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Qunsheng teams will be no different from the situation in the finals of the National Games of that year. A boom and an improvement in the level of basketball are expected.

### Selection of Stars

Furthermore, the list of Shanghai star basketball players who will go to the United States for observation has not yet been announced because there are various relationships involved. It is understood that it has been internally decided and approved by the Basketball Committee and the Executive Committee of the Sports Association. However, in accordance with the original intention of the 3198 team, the final list must be satisfactory to the team authorities before it can be announced. Initially, 3198 sent a letter to Qian Xucang, chairman of the Basketball Committee, with three conditions: (1) The number of team members is limited to seven (it may be increased to eight now), (2) They must be first-class players (the US military is familiar with the skills of the players of each team after participating in the league), (3) After the list is selected, it must be approved by 3198. Therefore, because of the above three reasons, Qian Xucang has spent a lot of effort, but with Qian's straightforwardness, impartiality, and selfless heart, he will surely be able to satisfy everyone.

### After Tax Exemption and Devaluation, Export Goods Mostly Increase in Price: Tung Oil and Pig Bristles Can Barely Be Marketed, Sheepskin, Sausage Casings, and Eggs Cannot Be Exported

[Our Reporter] Yesterday, several exporters told reporters that the biggest beneficiaries of the government's exchange rate adjustment are farmers who produce export goods and merchants who hold goods. Most exporters are intermediaries and cannot directly benefit. However, they hope that after the exchange rate increase, the price of Chinese exports can gradually become cheaper, making it easier for exporters to operate their businesses. However, judging from the recent prices of major export goods such as tung oil and pig bristles, their prices have increased by several percent compared to before the exchange rate adjustment. For tung oil, the market price before the exchange rate adjustment was about 70,000 yuan per dan. In the past two days, the asking price has reached 110,000 to 120,000 yuan per dan. Currently, the market price of tung oil in the United States is about US$0.36 per pound, which roughly equals 100,000 yuan per dan in the Chinese market. Argentina and other regions in South America also produce tung oil. The quality is lower, and the quantity is not large, but the asking price is only US$0.21 per pound. The United States itself also produces substitutes for tung oil. Therefore, if the market price of Chinese tung oil continues to rise, it will inevitably lose its market in the United States. It is hoped that Chinese tung oil merchants will be vigilant. As for pig bristles, the market price before the exchange rate adjustment was about 350,000 yuan per dan. In the past two days, it has risen to 550,000 yuan per dan. The market price of pig bristles in the United States was as high as US$3.50 per pound four months ago due to shortages and high prices. Recently, it has fallen to US$2.00 per pound, which is equivalent to about 600,000 yuan per dan in the Chinese market. Therefore, in the current situation, the export of tung oil and pig bristles should not encounter difficulties due to excessive prices. Sheepskin was about 160,000 yuan per dan before the exchange rate adjustment, but has recently risen to 250,000 yuan per dan. There is a widespread shortage of cow and sheep skins in the world, and the United States is offering US$0.80 per pound for sheepskin. However, calculated at the domestic market price of 250,000 yuan per dan, the cost is about US$1.01 per pound. Therefore, the export of sheepskin is already difficult. As for sausage casings, exports are impossible because domestic prices are too high, and the quality lacks standards. Egg exports have also decreased sharply in China after the war. The supply is insufficient for domestic demand, and prices are high. Under the universal food price limit system abroad, it is fundamentally impossible to export eggs. It is said that since the exchange rate adjustment, merchants holding export goods have increased the prices of various export goods according to the ratio of the increased exchange rate and the amount of export tax exemption. It is hoped that the price increase will be limited and will not affect the original export prices. Recently, importers have been quite hesitant and have been calling for lower prices. It is currently heard that Chinese exporters are planning to jointly maintain

Huai River Journey

This Newspaper’s Dispatch from Linhuai Pass on the 17th. Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi.

[From ancient times, securing the Yangzte River has always required securing the Huai River first.] – Ye Shi

From nature to society, the current Huai River shows no sign of being secure. Flooding is everywhere, and the disaster is severe. Highway transportation is cut off, and at least five million people are trapped in the water, unable to move. The Huai River’s own water would not have caused a disaster, but with the addition of the Yellow River’s water, it has become like the situation in the 20th year of the Republic (1931).

The blocking of the Huayuankou breach was not completed, and on July 22nd, with a loud bang, the breach was widened, and the Yellow River’s water came like the Jia Lu River, passing through Yingchuan and rushing into the Huai River. According to measurements by the Yellow River Engineering Bureau, the flow rate is 8,000 cubic meters per second. The Huai River’s maximum flow rate is 15,000, and its own flow rate this year is close to 7,000, which perfectly adds up to the full amount, restoring the record of the 20th year of the Republic (1931). However, in the past fifteen years, the riverbed has accumulated a lot of silt, increasing the flow rate and creating new record water levels.

In the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the Huai River’s highest water level was 20.17 meters, which was from the Huai River’s own water. If it is the same this year, plus the Yellow River’s water, then Shen Ke Bi (a phrase implying “it’s all over”), and the disaster situation will be unimaginable.

Raging Floodwaters

The reporter was ordered to take a trip to the Huai River region. Looking around, raging floodwaters were everywhere, with broad and expansive waves. Added to the sounds of gunfire, I recalled Du Fu’s line, “Blood stains the rivers and plains red.” Pain filled my chest, and I could not restrain myself. A vast expanse of white, shimmering with ochre-yellow, revealed a few clusters of rooftops, some fields of sorghum, or sparsely scattered soybean leaves, swaying in the waves, as if saying something. This is the scenery that can be seen everywhere.

The Anhui Provincial Government has an engineering organization for seizing the Huai River embankments, humorously named the “Yellow River Prevention Office.” The Huai River Guidance Committee, having returned from Sichuan, took the first action regarding the Huai River, which was to restore the embankments, establishing the “Embankment Restoration Engineering Bureau.” It will repair 1,080 kilometers of Huai River embankments, pile up over 14 million cubic meters of earth, and raise the embankment body to one meter above the flood level, planning to complete the work by the end of this year. It requested 27,000 tons of flour from the Executive Headquarters for work relief. However, since May, more than 3,000 tons have already been used to cooperate with the Yellow River Prevention Office for emergency relief and repair of breaches. It is feared that 27,000 tons of flour will not be enough by the time the plan is completed. Before repairs are made, breaches occur, leading to being caught off guard.

Yesterday morning, with heavy rain pouring down, I saw Bureau Chief Yin Chengzhi in Bengbu. He looked at the sky, his face filled with dark clouds, and said, “With this rain, the water level will break records. Today it is 20.15 meters.” By evening, it had indeed risen to 20.18 meters. He said, “If there were no Yellow River water, the Huai River water level would be at least two meters lower, and there would be no problem.”

The Yellow River Prevention Office uses forced labor, just like the Embankment Restoration Bureau, and they are extremely busy. Working in this area, I secretly pondered that the news of such a large-scale disaster is still being ignored or even unknown, which is undoubtedly because the news of peace talks and fighting has overshadowed it!

Silent Disaster Area

After a disaster, the second topic is naturally disaster relief. Such articles and topics are endless in China. However, this large-scale flood has not yet attracted attention from all parties. The tragic ending will eventually be a tragedy. Traffic in the disaster area is blocked, and millions of people are trapped in the water, almost silently. They maintain silence, as if isolated from the outside world. The Anhui Provincial Party and Government Restoration Supervision Group is now becoming a disaster investigation group, but it cannot collect numerical data for the time being. Is this paralysis of the political machinery or a satire thrown in by reality?

Liu Zhenru, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Nationalist Party, went to Nanjing for this matter to appeal to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Central Party Headquarters, and the Executive Headquarters. Anhui’s local newspapers concernedly published his news, saying, “It has already aroused the attention of people from all walks of life to the disaster situation in northeastern Anhui, and the future is quite optimistic.”

Because the water level of the Huai River is high, the water from the tributaries cannot be discharged, so it overflows. As of now, the disaster situation is extremely serious, with no signs of optimism. The most severely affected areas in northeastern Anhui include Yingshang, Fuyang, Taihe, Linquan, Fengtai, Huaiyuan, Suxian, Lingbi, Dingyuan, Jiashan, Xuyi, Tianchang, Lai’an, Wuhe, Sixian, Fengyang, Mengcheng, and Guoyang. The disaster area is estimated to be no less than 50,000 square kilometers!

The Anhui Provincial Government, the Party Headquarters, and the Provincial Assembly jointly handled three matters: First, requesting work relief and emergency relief from the Relief Branch; Second, requesting the Executive Yuan to exempt agricultural taxes; Third, requesting that the restoration funds be increased from 100 million yuan to 1 billion yuan.

Everyone must know that among the counties listed above, in addition to floods, there are also those that have suffered from war. Not only that, but some counties also have locust plagues this year. Super restoration work is needed. Regarding the harvest, I asked people familiar with Anhui, and they said that there would always be 10% to 20% of a harvest, “Each county has some mountainous areas.” This is the reason.

When the Communist troops retreated from Wuhe, somehow, the embankments of the Hui River suddenly collapsed, so coincidentally. Now Wuhe County is submerged in water, and the roads are impassable. The exiled county government is located in the Zhangjia Building in Linhuai Pass. Although the National Army has entered, County Magistrate Zhang Xian has been slow to go. Some of the gentlemen who escaped were killed somehow at night because they returned too early. Therefore, safety issues were given great consideration, and a nominal county magistrate naturally had his considerations. However, the people of Wuhe rushed to Linhuai Pass, pasting slogans around the Zhangjia Building, pushing people to request an audience, and respectfully welcoming the county magistrate to return to the county. Only on the 14th did a boat go to Wuhe for “restoration.”

Lieutenant General Xu Qiming, Chief of Staff of Xia Wei, advised me not to go to Wuhe, “Wait half a month or twenty days.”

The Battle of Sixian

The ancients often compared the Huai and Si Rivers, saying, “Those who wish to control the Central Plains must obtain the Huai and Si Rivers.” In reality, this refers to the two Huai areas. The five counties in eastern Anhui are now entirely under the control of the National Army, while eleven counties in northern Jiangsu are still in the hands of the Communist troops. “Securing the Yangzte River first requires securing the Huai River.” The war in northern Jiangsu is actually a struggle for the Huai River region. The threat to Nanjing is a common theme, and the propaganda rhetoric is comparable. If the Huai and Si Rivers move, the situation in the Central Plains will be dangerous, and the overall situation will change. The impact is not to be taken lightly.

Currently, the eastern Anhui region is mostly submerged in water. The National Army in this area is mostly composed of soldiers from Guangxi, wading through the swampy countryside and advancing eastward. The reporter once hesitated on the road to Wuhe. The Communist troops, with a force of 30,000, launched a fierce attack on Sixian starting on the evening of the 7th. The attack was sudden and fierce. The battle ended on the 10th, and the Communist troops retreated. When I returned to Bengbu, I met Lieutenant General Xu Qiming, Chief of Staff of General Xia Wei, on the way. I then learned the details of the battle of Sixian.

Among the Communist troops attacking Sixian, there were three regiments of the Eighth Division of the Eighth Route Army and three regiments of the Seventh Division, all newly transferred from the eastern section of the Longhai Railway in southern Shandong. There were also four regiments of the Second Division of the New Fourth Army, three independent regiments of the Seventh Military District, and the entire Ninth Column. In addition, there were over 10,000 puppet troops from Hao Pengju’s Huaibei forces, without a doubt. The total force was 30,000.

Using such a large force to attack a small city shows that it was a major battle. Here, I would particularly like to talk about Hao Pengju. Isn’t the Communist army always strongly opposed to the government’s incorporation of puppet troops? Why did they now unite with the puppet troops to attack Sixian? Or did the puppet troops unite with the Communist army to attack Sixian? Answers to these questions were obtained from familiar sources:

(1) It is indeed true that the Communist army has taken in and incorporated Hao Pengju, and commanded him. The puppet troops participating in the attack on Sixian this time were part of Hao Pengju’s puppet army. (2) At the beginning of the Japanese surrender, Chairman Chiang ordered the puppet troops to maintain local order in their original stationed areas and await orders. Hao Pengju, then serving as the puppet governor of Huaibei Province, transformed himself into the National Army and held a large-scale “takeover” in Xuzhou, sweeping up everything. When the 32nd Group Army of the National Army advanced into Xuzhou, Xuzhou had become an empty city. The authorities designated Hao Pengju’s troops to temporarily station in the Caocun area on the Jinpu Railway line and await reorganization orders. The Communist army then used force or political means to persuade Hao Pengju to “disarm.” In March of this year, the government ordered the downsizing of troops across the country, so Hao Pengju surrendered to the Communist army with his men and guns, without needing to downsize.

The National Army defending Sixian had only six battalions, less than two regiments. Thirty thousand Communist troops attacked fiercely, and on the evening of August 7th, they were suddenly broken into. At the destroyed breaches in the city walls of the Great and Small North Gates, Communist troops broke in, with two regiments’ worth of personnel. Sixian had been built into an independent stronghold-style fortification. After a fierce battle overnight, by daybreak, the invading Communist troops were annihilated. On the evening of the 8th, they attacked the Southeast Gate again and were repelled again. At dawn on the 9th, they attacked again and were again broken into the Great North Gate, leading to street fighting and contention for residences, lasting until the evening, when they were again driven out. On the morning of the 10th, the Communist troops retreated completely.

According to reports, there were 3,000 corpses left inside the North Gate of Sixian City and in the suburbs. In total, the casualties will reach 10,000. The National Army suffered a total of 35 officer casualties and 951 soldier casualties.

“Piles of corpses make the grass and trees stink.” Sixian was defended, but it was also destroyed. Looking up at the sorrowful clouds and mourning the heroic souls from afar, this place is war!

Winds and Rains in Linhuai Pass

Taking the Jinpu Railway into the plain south of the Huai River, one can gradually see the scenery of carrying guns while herding cattle. As the autumn wind rises, ten thousand feet of dark clouds surge past, and raindrops pound the train windows. Very few people are taking the express train north, and the train is unusually desolate. Looking out at the surrounding fields, it seems as if one is in the Ze Township, and this is especially true in Linhuai Pass.

With the break in the western section of the Longhai Railway, the operating income of the Jinpu Railway has become even more dismal. A deputy stationmaster earns only a little over 100,000 yuan, which is only enough to buy two loads of rice. The headquarters are in Jinan, and the Jiaoji Railway is being repaired. Both places have no income at all and need to take money from the Puxu and Jinde sections. Every month, income falls short of expenditure. The Puxu section suffered two destructive offensives from the Communist army in October and December last year. Railway engineers worked desperately to repair and restore traffic for emergency purposes. Many bridges are in critical condition and have not been resolved. With the flood season approaching, there were plans to completely repair the bridges from March to May to make them permanent and avoid being affected by the floodwaters. In theory, the production capacity of the Puzhen Vehicle Factory could produce all the planned beam materials and rivets within a month, but the area north of Xuzhou also needed to be repaired and needed to supply fishplates, screws, and spikes, so the flood prevention plan failed. As of now, only one-third of the bridges planned for repair have been completed. Thanks to heaven (as the engineers see it), the bridges in critical condition have not had any accidents under careful protection. When the train approaches a bridge, there is a large red paint board next to the road, with the four white characters "Stop and then go" written on it. The white characters have peeled off, but the board is still red. The driver still stops and then goes, driving the vehicle slowly, as if stealthily feeling their way across. It really requires a great deal of careful patience.

Chronicle of the Sanchong Gully

Linhuai Pass belongs to Fengyang County. The county government is in Fengyang, but the police station is located in Linhuai Pass. The reason for this can be easily guessed. Half a month ago, the north bank of Linhuai Pass was still within the sphere of influence of the Communist army. The Communist army entered and exited from the villages of Hanjiatai, Guofuyao, Nanxinzhuang, Caofuqiao, and Huangbanzi. The designation was an independent regiment of the Seventh Military District. They dug trenches on the embankments on both sides of the Sanchong Gully. The Communist army occupied a gun emplacement on the north bank of the gully. In order to clear the line of fire, they leveled 200 meters of the embankment on the south bank (see attached photo). Although the residents of Hebei Town had some defenses, they did not treat it as a major enemy. The diagram only shows the relationship in this area. The people of Hebei Town said, "Once the Communist army really wants to enter Hebei Town, we can only let them in." They were on sentry duty in this area.

When the water level of the Huai River rose, the people in the Guofuyao area were jumping up and down in a hurry. They watched with their own eyes the dikes being built on the south bank of the river, but the Sanchong Gully had a 200-meter opening. Guo Hexian, the Bao Chief of Guofu Bao, said, "We contacted them, and they agreed to let us repair it, but only allowed 20 people to go every day, and only those from Guofu Bao. As a result, we didn't repair it."

An engineer from the Huai River Guidance Committee said, "There are more than 2,000 cubic meters of earth here. It would take 200 people ten days to complete it." This is a scientific calculation, which shows that using 20 people to seize the dike is equivalent to zero.

At the beginning of this month, the Communist army retreated because the water had already come. From a military point of view, the water has changed the importance of the Sanchong Gully, and there is no longer a need to hold onto this gun emplacement. The Huai River Guidance Committee only recently surveyed the dike from the Sanchong Gully to Hebei Town and began repairs, but the floodwaters broke through again on the 15th, and a triangular area across from Linhuai Pass is now a vast expanse of water. The Communist army once dug 200 meters of the embankment here, which was of no benefit to the local people. This is an ironclad fact. The people of Guofu Bao are all witnesses.

If the dike restoration project on the south bank cannot proceed like the Sanchong Gully and cannot be repaired, then the water situation in Linhuai Pass will definitely be even more unimaginable. Not even one engineer has gone to the Wuhe area yet. I said goodbye to the engineers. We looked at each other's skin and faces, all so black. We said goodbye to each other in the mud, wishing each other good health and safety.

As we approached Linhuai Pass, the car slowly crossed a bridge with a frame where the water was about to touch the outer steel beams, and then entered the station. At this time, the streets of Linhuai Pass were revealed before us. Almost the entire town of Linhuai Pass was submerged in water, and the roads were clogged with mud. This is still the situation after the dikes were repaired, otherwise it would be even more serious. Walking into the street, the water was knee-deep, but you could still take a rickshaw. If the water rose again, then there would be no other way but to rely on land boats. The terrain on the main street is higher, but even so, many houses on the edge of town have mostly collapsed into the water, with some still revealing a roof ridge, making people feel nostalgic. If the flood had washed away everything so that there was no trace left, then the meaning of the word "disaster" would be lost. Now, the disaster-stricken residents are crowding onto the main street, or building simple shacks on the embankment or in open spaces, dragging mud and water, with a foul odor in the air, and cries intertwined. Those who have been here for a long time may not notice the chaotic situation. I, who have just arrived, cannot help but be shocked. People are stubbornly holding onto this land ravaged by floods. What are they waiting for? And the people from Wuhe and other places are still hiding here, not daring to return home.

They ran around telling each other the news of the rising and falling water levels. The doors of most of the shops on the street were wide open, empty, with only smelly, turbid water swirling inside. These shops have mostly moved, but many small shops are still firmly guarding their spots, conducting business as usual. They have put everything up high, and their beds are below the water, and when they lie down, their backs are only a foot away from the water. They are cramped in between, waiting for customers.

I found several engineers from the Huai River Guidance Committee in the mud. They were working hard, fighting the water, and working extremely hard. During the War of Resistance, they measured the Shajiang River, repaired the Qijiang water diversion project, and developed water conservancy projects in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. After returning from restoration, they immediately encountered the Huai River flooding. We walked through the flooded streets in the wind and rain, inspecting the newly repaired dikes together. At the southern end of Linhuai Pass, they have rushed to repair a 5-kilometer-long embankment, providing work relief and using 300,000 cubic meters of earth. This embankment is not piled up with earth, but with flour! Each cubic meter of earth costs two catties of flour. If it is difficult to obtain earth or the road is far away, then it costs three or four catties per cubic meter. Two thousand people worked for two months to complete it. Many ships are crowded in Linhuai Pass because they cannot sail out, especially in Xinqiaowan. Along the 5-kilometer-long embankment, the masts are like a forest, extremely lively.

When will the water recede? There is no certainty at all. Linhuai Pass has been submerged in water for a month. I saw doctors carrying saline bottles and rubber tubes, wearing short clothes and wading into the water to see patients. - A terrible epidemic! (All photos are taken by special correspondent Shao Shenzhi.)

Seven Weeks

Xu Jiejun

Not long ago, I flew to Tokyo to testify at the Far East International Military Tribunal for the Trial of Japanese War Criminals and stayed there for seven weeks before returning to Shanghai. This gave me the opportunity to witness the post-war ruins of Tokyo and the post-war lives of ordinary people. I have compiled a random record for my compatriots to know some of the truths of the defeated countries, and there may be some things worth noting.

Post-war Tokyo is no longer what it used to be. About 70% to 80% of the buildings have been destroyed, especially in Yokohama, Osaka, and Kobe. Large and small factories have been razed to the ground. Only the destroyed chimneys remain, standing like reeds. Prosperous areas have been leveled. Ruined walls and broken walls are everywhere, leaving a desolate scene. Other cities, except for Kyoto and Nara, were also affected. Kyoto is a Japanese scenic spot, and Nara is a cultural area, so the Allied forces left one side of the net open during the bombing, preserving this glimmer of light. Even the locations of universities in the Tokyo area are still mostly intact. There are only minor scars near the Imperial Palace, showing a slight punishment and leaving room for reflection. Only the Ginza, Kanda, Asakusa, and Shibuya areas in the city are still lively. In other areas, there are few people, and the market is depressed. Tokyo citizens use empty spaces in the destroyed wasteland to plant vegetables, transforming the city into a farm. It is truly an overwhelming feeling of vicissitudes.

Tokyo originally had a population of more than 7 million, but now only half remain. There are many cars running in the city, mostly motorcycles from the United States. From the Imperial Palace to the various ministries, there is silence. The doors can be used to catch birds. The city, once known as the fifth largest city in the world, now has no large buildings left except for the empty streets, which are still a symbol. Only the magnificent and splendid Meiji Shrine stands tall, complete and unharmed. Inside the palace, the two walls are inlaid with eighty famous paintings, each more than ten feet long and wide, depicting the life of Meiji, from birth to burial, and the performance of various political achievements during the Meiji Restoration. The brushstrokes are vivid, and the painting methods also evolved with the times. The first half imitates the rendering of our country, and the second half imitates the oil painting of the West, showing the extreme beauty and vividness. What is especially striking is the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War. The state of showing off one's power abroad that day is vividly displayed on paper, and the scene of Li Hongzhang and Ito Hirobumi arguing on equal footing in the Shunpanro Pavilion in Shimonoseki is lifelike. Looking at it now, it has become a historical relic. If it is compared with the film of the war criminals being tried in court today, I don't know what they would think. Those who love war will surely be defeated, which is enough to be a warning.

The current living conditions of the Japanese people are what my compatriots want to know. Clothing is not considered very important by the Japanese. Although many houses have been bombed, people generally build small houses in the destroyed wasteland to avoid wind and rain. The most serious problem is food. Japan has always lacked food and relied on Vietnam, Indonesia, Taiwan, and other places for supplies. During the war, they relied on military force to arbitrarily seize from the occupied territories. I don't know how many stones of food our country transported back to the country every year, but now this source has been completely cut off. Food panic is inevitable. At present, each person is allocated only two gō and one shakyu of rice per day, which is not enough for one meal for a strong man. The Japanese government is still afraid that it will be difficult to continue. Cabinet discussions and newspaper appeals have the theme of profound reflection. Not only food, but also oil, salt, meat, vegetables, and even daily necessities such as cigarettes, matches, soap, and towels are all rationed, and there is almost nowhere to buy them in the market. Occasionally there is a black market, but the prices are high. Except for a few Chinese restaurants opened by overseas Chinese, most are small restaurants. What is displayed in the shops is all artificial silk, hand tools, children's toys, and books and textbooks. Applied items are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. The Allied forces transport all the staple and non-staple foods and Japanese items here themselves. However, the Japanese currency has not been highly inflated, and the ordinary price index is no more than a hundred times higher than before the war. Rationed items are all at flat prices, only about ten times higher. It is said that 300 yuan per month is enough for ordinary people to live on. Therefore, although materials are difficult to obtain, the social situation is still stable. The item of travel is even less of a problem. The Japanese manage the transportation industry very well. Trains run on time, and the time is very accurate. Streetcars run through the streets, and buses replace them where streetcars cannot reach. The roads are mostly wide asphalt roads. There are also those made of small stones, all neat and flat. Underground tunnels run horizontally and vertically, all connected by streetcars, and there are shops and markets. In the suburbs, there are elevated streetcars for connection. In addition, there are many bicycles, but what we call "Eastern cars" are almost extinct. Only a few dozen remain in the lively Ginza area as decorations for the Allied forces from the West. This is enough to show their saving of manpower. Although streetcars are also crowded, the order is quite good. You don't have to buy a cumulative amount when you get on the bus. Everyone pays for the supplement ticket when you get off the bus, and there are no omissions. Other public utilities such as telephones are widespread in the countryside, and although sanitation facilities have been destroyed, people are quite able to clean themselves to make up for the deficiency. Social Service

This newspaper and the Relief Hospital jointly organized the trachoma prevention campaign.

Free treatment for all middle school and college students and faculty in this city

Mr. Rao Jiaju, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Relief Hospital, and Dr. Wang Juerong, Director of the Hospital, have recently decided to jointly organize a "Trachoma Prevention Campaign" because trachoma is rampant among students in various schools in this city, accounting for more than 60% of the total. If prevention and treatment are not carried out early, it will inevitably affect health and cause great harm. The first session will be temporarily limited to middle school students and faculty, and 150 people will be diagnosed and treated first. The diagnosis and medication fees will be completely free. After the first session is cured, it will continue to be carried out to fulfill the duties of a citizen. At the same time, it is hoped that with the advocacy of our newspaper and the hospital, major hospitals in the city and across the country will rise up in response to prevent and treat trachoma, so that patients across the country can always see the light, which will be of great benefit to the country and society. The simplified rules are attached below:

Simplified Rules for the "Trachoma Prevention Campaign" jointly organized by the Social Service Department of Shen Bao and the Social Service Department of the Relief Hospital

(1) Eligibility: All middle school and college students or faculty members in this city who suffer from trachoma can apply for treatment.

(2) The free treatment is tentatively set for one to two months, and all expenses are free.

(3) The doctors are Dr. Sun Yuanming and Dr. Zhang Yiyong, ophthalmology experts specially invited by the Relief Hospital (formerly ophthalmology specialists at Guangci Hospital).

(4) Registration: Starting from August 25, students and faculty members who suffer from trachoma should first fill out an application form at the Social Service Department of this newspaper and take it to the Relief Hospital at 547 Xizang South Road for consultation. Answering Readers’ Questions Legal Enquiries (1) Arrest and Questioning Cai Bingfu asks: (1) Kuang Mingkai, a large local bully in Xinghua County, has been notorious for kidnapping and robbery. Later, he openly defected to the enemy and served as the head of a puppet regiment for five years, harming the local area for more than ten years, which he admits without denial. Do active military officers have the right to arrest him? (2) If the criminal is killed while being escorted because he tries to escape, is the person in charge committing a crime? (3) Is there any crime in escorting the criminal to the general depot without handing him over to the Pacification Headquarters? (4) Reading the newspaper about the Regulations for Punishing Traitors, it states that all puppet military officers above the rank of major will be punished according to the severity of their crimes. Does Kuang's crime apply to this regulation? (5) Can the pre-trial records, which were read out on the spot and approved by Kuang with his fingerprints, be valid? (6) The defendant, Fan Cheng, has eliminated a great scourge for the county, and the people are sincerely grateful. Now, driven by conscience, they plan to rescue him. How should they proceed? [Lawyer Fu Kuangling replies] (1) If it is as stated in the letter, the criminal's crimes are obvious, and there is nothing wrong with arresting him and sending him for punishment. (2) If the criminal escapes and cannot be caught, and is shot and killed, the officer in charge should be held administratively liable according to the law, and the escort soldier who carried out the shooting should be held liable for negligent homicide. (3) From a military perspective, it is appropriate to hand over the criminal to the general depot of the direct superior authority. (4) According to Article 302, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, it is considered illegal detention, but if the time limit is exceeded due to unavoidable circumstances, it can be waived after verification. (5) Since the criminal once served as the head of a puppet regiment, he is of the rank of colonel and is subject to punishment under the Regulations for Punishing Traitors. (6) Of course it is valid. (7) Reputable local gentry can jointly write to the handling authority, detailing the facts and proving that the defendant has eliminated a scourge for the local area and that there are extenuating circumstances, for the handling authority to refer to. (2) Malicious Abandonment Yu Wenjing asks: I am a timid woman. My husband is a rogue, a gambler, and a smoker. In the summer of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), the enemy invaded our hometown. He took this opportunity to force me to leave home by various criminal means of intimidation and abuse, otherwise, he would kill me. I had no choice but to be forced to return to my mother's home and suffer abandonment. Later, although I asked many people to reason with him, he always spoke unreasonably and did not get a concrete solution. He neither allows me to return home nor bears my living expenses, nor does he divorce me. For five years, I have been living a wandering and miserable life. Please ask: (1) Is this considered abandonment? What kind of procedures should I take to resort to law? (2) In this situation, can I unilaterally publish a divorce notice in the newspaper? Will it be legally valid? (3) After the divorce, who is responsible for the education, marriage, and matching of the children? If I do not go through the divorce procedure and remarry someone else, is it legal? (4) If I cohabit with someone and am sued by my original husband, will I and the person I cohabit with be subject to legal sanctions? [Lawyer Fu Kuangling replies] (1) It is undoubtedly malicious abandonment, which is a crime under the Criminal Law. (2) If the malicious acts are still continuing, you can petition the court for divorce, but it is not legally based for one party to publish a divorce notice in the newspaper. (3) After the divorce, the husband is legally responsible for the children's education, upbringing, and marriage, but if there is another agreement, follow the agreement. (4) Divorce procedures must be followed. (5) Before the divorce procedure is completed, the marital relationship still exists. If you cohabit with someone, you are committing a crime under Article 239 of the Criminal Law, punishable by imprisonment for up to one year, and the adulterer is also subject to the same punishment.

Hygiene and Medicine The Meaning and Importance of Mental Hygiene Xia Zhenyi

During cholera outbreaks, health authorities always conduct extensive epidemic prevention publicity, making the public deeply aware of the danger of cholera and the importance of prevention. There is also an annual anti-tuberculosis campaign, making people understand the harm that tuberculosis poses to national health and the urgency of eradication. I have often browsed through general school health textbooks, and cholera and tuberculosis occupy important positions, but we have neglected an even more formidable enemy to national health—mental illness. We know that the whole person consists of two aspects: physical and mental. We should pay attention to both physical hygiene and mental hygiene. We pay attention to physical health, and we must not neglect mental health. La Rue said, "Without mental health, only physical health is not considered true health."

Two Meanings

In today's turbulent world, people's everything has lost its guarantee, and they live in a state of high tension. The increasing number of mentally ill people and the seriousness of the problem are undeniable. The direct and indirect losses caused by mental illness every year are truly terrifying. Although there are no accurate statistics on mentally ill people in our country, it is not difficult to estimate the astonishing numbers and losses by comparing them with statistics from other countries. Take the United States as an example. According to a 1920 report by the American Medical Association, one in every 325 people in the country suffers from mental illness. According to a survey in New York, one in every 22 people in the state suffers from mental illness. There are a total of 430,800 patients in mental hospitals in the United States, and the number increases by 20,000 each year. According to 1926 statistics, the United States spends a total of 90 million gold dollars on mental hospitals each year. The loss of wages for patients in New York State alone reaches 14.3 million gold dollars. The moral and spiritual losses are even more alarming. On average one in 125 couples in the United States divorce due to mental illness. There are 500,000 crimes and 15,000 suicides nationwide each year, about half of which are caused by mental illness. By 1936, 1% of the U.S. population had symptoms of mental illness, and the number of mentally ill people had increased to 1.3 million, accounting for 47% of hospital beds nationwide. The maintenance cost of mental hospitals each year is 308.65 million gold dollars. Recently, President Truman stated in Congress: "At least 2 million people in the United States suffer from mental illness, and at least 10 million people will need to be treated for mental illness in hospitals at some point in their lives." If we combine all the above-mentioned losses, whether moral, economic, orderly, or career-related, we can see how serious the problem of mental illness has become. To solve this problem and avoid all kinds of incalculable losses, the promotion and advancement of mental hygiene is an urgent matter.

I know that most Chinese people do not have a deep understanding of mental hygiene, and even more people do not know what mental hygiene is all about. Mental hygiene uses scientific methods and artistic techniques to enable individuals to develop mentally in a healthy and natural way, so as to cultivate a sound personality. It has two meanings: The negative aspect is to prevent the occurrence of mental illness and improve the treatment of mentally ill people; the positive aspect is to promote mental health and cultivate a complete personality.

Misconceptions

The various aspects of mental illness prevention will be discussed in detail in another article. Correcting attitudes and concepts towards mentally ill people is also one of the important tasks in promoting mental hygiene in the future. Many people in society still cannot treat mentally ill people with the same sympathy as other physical illnesses. Society's attitude towards mentally ill people is still inevitably cold, honest, and discriminatory. They still superstitiously believe that mentally ill people are possessed by demons or punished by gods,

### Central Air Transport Corporation's Successful Endeavor: Profitable Sixty Billion in Seven Months Since Moving to Shanghai; Six Existing Routes, Expansion Planned to Foreign Countries

[Special Report from This Newspaper] At Longhua Airport, there are currently two airlines, one is the "China" airline jointly operated by China and the United States, and the other is the "Central" airline purely operated by Chinese.

When we officially declared war on Germany four years ago, the Sino-German joint venture Eurasia Aviation Corporation was taken over and reorganized by the Ministry of Communications. At that time, all that existed were four Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft, flying irregularly from Kunming to Guilin, Chongqing, Hong Kong and other places, as well as northwest Hami, Dihua, and Lanzhou. However, with the outbreak of the Pacific War, they were bombed and destroyed by the Japanese air force, leaving only one. This one had also exceeded its flight age.

At this time, in the Chinese commercial aviation industry, there were three or four veteran aviators who, in order to develop the urgently needed commercial aviation industry in China, agreed with the Ministry of Communications to form the "Central Air Transport Corporation." They obtained a Japanese "Type 97" bomber from the Aviation Committee and flew irregularly between Chengdu and various important cities, assisting the government in transporting goods. Later, they successively obtained three or four Lockheed light bombers. Although these were barely sufficient with the efforts of a few people, they were not suitable for commercial airliners.

In the autumn of 1945, victory arrived, and the U.S. military left behind a large amount of surplus material in India. "Central" also purchased eleven U.S. military aircraft. The five young aviators of "Central" personally flew those aircraft from India across the Hiamlayas over the Hump, to Kunming. At that time, it was the beginning of the government's post-war recovery, and the lack of transportation created an unprecedented opportunity to develop commercial aviation. These five people took turns taking off every day, vigorously and enthusiastically cultivating this barren land of Chinese commercial aviation. Around Christmas last year, they moved from Kunming to Shanghai, occupying a place at Longhua Airport.

Their painstaking efforts finally did not disappoint them. Today, they own seventy airworthy passenger transport aircraft, with twenty in regular flight. There are also more than a hundred newly purchased U.S. military surplus aircraft currently parked at Jiangwan Airport undergoing refurbishment.

The number of flight personnel has increased to fourteen, and recruitment is still ongoing. By the end of this year, there will be more than twenty overseas Chinese pilots from the U.S. Air Force who, after retiring, will come to sign contracts and join. Twenty aviation personnel returning from training in the United States will also be hired.

Currently, there are a total of six major routes: Shanghai-Kunming, Shanghai-Chongqing, Shanghai-Peiping (Beijing), Shanghai-Hong Kong, and the recently opened Shanghai-Lanzhou and Shanghai-Xi'an routes. In the planning stages, they are also extending the South China route to Vietnam and Bangkok, and extending the Hong Kong route to the Philippines, to facilitate transportation between overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and their motherland.

In the seven months since "Central" moved to Shanghai, the gross profit has reached 6 billion National Currency, making it the only profitable transportation enterprise under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications. This huge profit is used to purchase new aircraft, ground equipment, and transportation vehicles. The number of ground personnel has also surged to more than 1,200, with a total monthly salary expenditure of 200 million.

However, the head of the Flight Group and the Chief Pilot are not complacent about this. They all say, "Our purpose is not to make a profit. We have only one goal: to expand China's aviation industry, to do our best to lay a foundation for future progress, and to prove to the world with facts that the Chinese people have the technology and ability to operate airline routes independently."

Currently, they still have two major difficulties to overcome: (1) The lack of buildings and hangar facilities cannot be reconciled with the ever-expanding aviation industry, and it is impossible to accommodate so many new aircraft. At the same time, a modern airport is what they are looking forward to day and night. (2) The huge customs duties paid when purchasing new aircraft and ground equipment have increased their burden. These difficulties are currently being requested for assistance from the wise authorities.

Chinese commercial aviation is nurtured and growing in Longhua Airport, and now it is about to take a big step forward! The vast Chinese wilderness is their virgin land to be cultivated, and the whole world is their battlefield. Their success is to be expected!

### Cable Fees to Europe and America Adjusted According to New Exchange Rate

The International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications has been ordered to, starting today, change the fees for news telegrams sent to various countries in Europe and America, which are valued in U.S. dollars converted into National Currency, to be calculated according to the Central Bank's U.S. dollar exchange rate, at 3,350 National Currency per U.S. dollar. At the same time, the rate of conversion of gold francs into National Currency has also been changed to 1,100 National Currency per gold franc.
