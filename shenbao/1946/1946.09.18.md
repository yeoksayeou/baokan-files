[Reuters, Nanjing, 17th] The entire Northeast has been in an explosive state of silence for the past few weeks. The next phase of the war is expected to occur at the crossing of the Songhua River. Du Yuming's troops do not seem to intend to delve deeply into the Communist Army's area. Instead, they intend to use the time to consolidate the transportation corridor between Shenyang and Changchun. There are still a considerable number of Communist troops in the southeast of Liaoning and south of the Songhua River, occupying isolated areas, but these elements, which only have a harassing effect, are no longer a major threat.

[Reuters, Tianjin, 16th] Sources in the North China government have learned that the Communist Army in the Northeast is establishing a large-scale operational base in Jiamusi, on the south bank of the Songhua River, 150 miles northeast of Harbin. Over the past few days, war materiel transported from Harbin to that location includes forty Japanese-made tanks and twenty damaged Japanese aircraft. These aircraft will be repaired by Japanese technicians. Jiamusi also has a mechanized unit training school, headed by a Japanese instructor. The Harbin authorities have instructed residents to donate cotton for the Communist Army to make cotton clothes. Pro-government sources also stated that the movement of the Communist Army in the Northeast is aimed at concentrating on Anshan, Haitong (transliteration), Taolaizhao, Lafa, and Faku, to correspond with the Communist Army outside the Northeast. These Communist troops will adopt guerrilla tactics against the National Army. It is also learned that the Communist Party in the Northeast is forcing the people to hold meetings and implementing liberation movements.

The Topographical Department of the Ministry of Interior has already produced a blueprint of the new provincial boundaries. This matter will be officially announced once it is approved by the Executive Yuan. It is said that the reasons for the re-division are divided into two points: (1) After the re-division, some of the previously overly impoverished provinces, such as Andong and Liaobei, will be joined with some prosperous areas to make the economic capacity of the nine provinces approximately equal; (2) In the past, most of the provincial capitals of the nine provinces were on the Central Changchun Railway Line, which seems inappropriate from the current military and political perspectives.

The central government's efforts for peace have not been relaxed at all. This time, he reported to the Chairman, who had high expectations. Although the spread of war has overshadowed the glory of mediation, the Military Mediation Department has its own future.

### Daughter of Traitor Wang Yitang Petitions for Retrial for Her Father

Death of Traitor Lin Bosheng Imminent

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 17th] After the top traitor in North China, Wang Yitang, was sentenced to death, the judgment has now been delivered, recounting Wang's major crimes during his tenure as Chairman of the Puppet Provisional Government and the Puppet North China Political Affairs Commission, stating that he "held important positions early in his career, but did not cherish his reputation, seizing opportunities to rise, his crimes are obvious, and he should be sentenced to the death penalty." However, Wang's daughters, Shuzhen and Huizhen, and their appointed lawyer have petitioned for a retrial for Wang, saying that Wang was unable to defend himself during the trial due to illness, so he could not be directly sentenced according to Article 297 of the Criminal Procedure Law. They also said that Wang resigned as Chairman of the Committee before June 1, 1944, and should be given a reduced sentence. Although he later served as a puppet advisor, Jin Yunpeng was not prosecuted, etc. However, it is generally believed that Wang's daughter's petition for a retrial is mainly to delay the execution time, hoping that Wang will die of illness in prison. Wang has been eating and drinking less since hearing the death sentence, attempting to hasten his death before the execution. The prison authorities have taken strict precautions against his suicide.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] After traitor Lin Bosheng was sentenced to death, his wife, Xu Ying, petitioned for a retrial. On the 17th, the High Court ruled that the application for a retrial was rejected. Lin's death is imminent.

It was also heard that at 11:30 PM, he was still claiming to be hungry, telling the warden that he wanted to order a banquet from a restaurant for dinner, which was rejected by the prison authorities. Only after repeated requests was he allowed to buy a bowl of beef noodles for each person. After adjustments, Luo, Ma, and Yang were in one room, and Zhou and Ding were in one room, all with small iron beds and brocade bedding. It was also heard that they brought hundreds of pieces of luggage, and the responsible personnel finished cleaning up at 3:00 AM.

### Chairman Changed Weekend Trip to Jiangxi; Will Return to Xikou for Sixtieth Birthday Celebration

Changchun Citizens Presented a Book of Names Titled "Gratitude" to Madame Chiang

[Our Correspondent in Guling, 17th] According to reliable sources, Chairman Chiang decided to leave Guling with his wife on the 21st. After leaving Mount Lu, the Chairman will travel by car to Nanchang to inspect, while Madame Chiang will take a plane with Marshal Ma's couple and Song Ziliang back to Nanjing.

[Our Correspondent in Guling, 17th] October 30th of this year is the nationally designated sixtieth birthday celebration of Chairman Chiang. The Chairman's lunar birthday is September 25th (October 19th in the Gregorian calendar this year). It is reported that the Chairman will go to his hometown of Xikou at that time.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 17th] Hundreds of thousands of Changchun citizens, in order to express their gratitude to Madame Chiang for her concern for the suffering of the people and for raising relief funds, are presenting a "Book of Names of Gratitude" on silk, six zhang long and one chi five cun wide, with paper scrolls inlaid and containing the signatures of over 30,000 people.

### Situation at a Decisive Turning Point; Special Envoy Marshall Returned to Nanjing from Guling Yesterday; Met with the Ambassador at His Residence That Evening

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] Special Envoy Marshall returned to Nanjing from Guling at 5:30 PM on the 17th, accompanied by an American woman with many pieces of luggage. When reporters interviewed Mr. Marshall about his meeting with the Chairman after he got off the plane, Mr. Marshall did not answer as usual. Then, when reporters inquired about his wife's recent situation, he replied "Very good, thank you" and told them that his wife would have to wait until next week to return to Nanjing. It is learned that Madame Marshall was originally scheduled to return to Nanjing today, but she delayed her return until next week due to Madame Chiang's firm request for her to stay. After Mr. Marshall returned to his residence, Ambassador Stuart went to meet him at 7:00 PM. [Fu] Jingbo also went there half an hour later.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] The future of peace talks has now reached a critical and delicate stage. In the past few days, the general public has hoped that Special Envoy Marshall's return to Nanjing will bring some good news. At the same time, they further hope that the Chairman will return to Nanjing as soon as possible so that the problem negotiations do not have to go back and forth. However, Zhou Enlai went to Shanghai again yesterday on the pretext of "the masses" and Wang Bingnan said that he would not return to Nanjing until the military three-person conference was convened. From this sign, Zhou is very likely to be avoiding the issue. Therefore, the future of peace negotiations is difficult to imagine.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] After Zhou Enlai went to Shanghai, Wang Bingnan from the Communist Party side went out to make courtesy visits. At 11:00 AM on the 17th, Wang visited Fu Jingbo and talked for one hour. It is reported that the content of the talks still insisted on convening a military three-person group meeting, but Ambassador Stuart, who is in the middle, still did not give up the informal five-person group meeting to solve the problem politically.

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 17th] Communist Party spokesman Wang Bingnan said that if Special Envoy Marshall returns to Nanjing from Guling and cannot bring back the government's written reply accepting the Communist Party's restoration of the three-person group meeting, there will be no reason for negotiations. Therefore, after Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai goes to Shanghai today, there is no need to return to Nanjing. At the same time, we have not received any assistance from the Soviet Union and will continue to do so in the future. In short, Special Envoy Marshall's return to Nanjing from Guling this time has almost reached the final decision point.

### My Decision to Establish Governance in Kowloon City: Special Envoy Guo Negotiated with the Governor of Hong Kong; Director He of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Clarifies Our Stance

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 16th] The Bao'an County Government of Guangdong, regarding the establishment of governance rights in Kowloon City, after seeking instructions from the Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, has replied in accordance with the 1898 Beijing Treaty, that the establishment of governance in Kowloon City is feasible and is currently being planned. The Hong Kong government issued a statement on the 14th denying Chinese sovereignty over Kowloon City, which has caused some who are not familiar with the contents of the treaty to question the governance rights of Kowloon City. Guo Dehua, Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, met with the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Alexander Grantham, on the afternoon of the 16th, stating that the Chinese government will not abandon its treaty rights and that the governance of Kowloon City is in progress. According to the 1898 Beijing Treaty, China and Britain agreed to a 99-year lease of the New Territories, but the treaty stipulated that Chinese officials could reside in Kowloon City, without hindering the British military defense of Hong Kong, and exercise governance rights. The conditions also stipulated that Chinese officials and warships could travel and dock in the Kowloon pier area. In 1899, due to the armed resistance of the villagers of the "New Territories" against the British military police taking over land and property, the Chinese officers and soldiers stationed in Kowloon City were expelled, but the rights were not actually lost.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] He Fengshan, Director of the Information Department and Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, met with reporters today and answered their questions regarding a report that the Hong Kong government spokesperson recently made a statement denying that the area within Kowloon City is still Chinese territory and that China is currently exercising governance rights in the area. The spokesperson clarified our position, which is recorded below: Question: According to the Hong Kong government spokesperson, "The governance rights of Chinese officials in Kowloon City were terminated in 1899 due to conflicts with British military needs." Is this true? Answer: The Sino-British Convention Respecting an Extension of Hong Kong Territory of 1898 states: "The Chinese officials now stationed in Kowloon City shall continue to exercise jurisdiction there, but shall not interfere with the military requirements for the defense of Hong Kong." Since the agreement stipulates that Chinese officials can continue to exercise jurisdiction in the city, our country will certainly send officials there, because we have never abandoned our governance rights in Kowloon City. Question: Are there any differences between the two sides regarding the interpretation of this treaty? Answer: If there are differences in the interpretation of the treaty between the two sides, then in accordance with international law, it should be interpreted in favor of the country bearing the obligation, and our country is the country bearing the obligation in the 1898 Sino-British Lease of Kowloon Treaty.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th] At a time when Chinese fishermen in Hong Kong are being oppressed by the Hong Kong government and sending representatives to Guangzhou to appeal, the Hong Kong government has again announced the encroachment on the governance rights of Kowloon City, which has aroused serious attention among people here. The Dagong Bao today published an article titled "Another Unwise Move by the Hong Kong Government," severely criticizing British colonial policy, saying: They have not considered China's post-war status, nor do they recognize the friendly relations between China and Britain, and they often introduce unpleasant incidents. The article emphasized that this move has aroused great anger among the Chinese people and that China will no longer be fooled by colonial policies.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 17th] Local officials have not commented on today's news from the China Mail, which said: The Chinese government does not want to give up any treaty rights in Kowloon and wants to rebuild Chinese judicial power in Kowloon as soon as possible. The report said that "reliable Chinese sources" said that Guo Dehua, the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Special Envoy in Guangdong and Guangxi, on behalf of the Chinese government, wrote to the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Alexander Grantham, on this matter as the main theme.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] British Ambassador to China, Sir Horace Seymour, stated in a firm tone when he met with reporters on the 17th that the Hong Kong government's statement on the Kowloon sovereignty issue was "absolutely accurate!"

### The Government Should Build More Barracks to Promote Military-Civilian Relations

Yu Nanqiu's Talk After Returning from the Inspection

[This newspaper, Hankou, 17th] Yu Nanqiu, the leader of the third group of the inspection team in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, recently spoke to reporters about his experiences and impressions of the inspection in Jiangxi. He said that one-third of the cases reported in Jiangxi this time were housing disputes, and most of them were occupied by the military and warehouses. For example, the Jiangxi Provincial Vocational School in Jiujiang was occupied. After negotiating with the Supply Bureau, the bureau ordered the military to move out and restore the school. However, there are many such facts. Examining the root cause, the blame cannot be placed solely on the military. The national defense budget has not yet arrived, and it is impossible to build barracks, so the military's occupation of civilian housing has become a necessary habit, which has greatly affected social order. Moreover, these civilian houses are in poor condition and are not suitable for military use. On the one hand, it is enough to reduce the quality of the military, and on the other hand, it creates opportunities and excuses to bully the people, which is even more harmful. In order to correct this defect, the national defense authorities should start building barracks and warehouses at all military strongholds and transportation hubs across the country in order to completely solve the problem. Adopt the two methods of phased construction and cash requisition of civilian houses to gradually improve the situation and enhance military-civilian relations. It is not possible to turn a blind eye and tolerate it. Yu said finally that he would submit the results of his eyewitness observations as suggestions to the current Political Participation Council and ask the government to pay attention.

### The Jinhua River Water Conservancy Project Can Definitely Start Construction Next Month

[This newspaper, Hangzhou, 17th] This newspaper reporter recently visited Li Chukuang, the administrative inspector of the fourth district of Zhejiang Province, to discuss the Jinhua River water conservancy project. The project is second only to the Qiantangjiang Seawall project. Its initial plan is for emergency repairs. 19 emergency repair sites have been selected and can start construction next month. It is expected to be completed in March next year. The funds have been approved by the provincial government, but the Department of Finance has not yet allocated them. The Zhejiang-Fujian branch has agreed to allocate 600 tons of flour for labor relief, but only two kilograms per worker is far from enough, so it has been decided to request another 1,000 tons of rice to meet the needs. As for the permanent project plan, the outline has now been drafted and will be completed in stages so that farmland water conservancy can be reasonably adjusted and the counties can be electrified. The outline will soon be passed by the Senate and will be the basis for experts to design a concrete plan. The implementation of this plan will have to wait until after March next year.

Editorial

### Accept the Lessons of History!

Fifteen years ago today, on the universally known "September 18th Incident," Japanese imperialists bombarded the Beida Camp in Shenyang with artillery, occupying our Northeast provinces without a fight. This was not only the beginning of Japan's war of aggression against China, but also the fuse of World War II. From that day on, we raised the banner of anti-aggression, and after fourteen years of arduous struggle, we finally achieved final victory. Looking back on the experiences of the past fourteen years today, it is as if we have lived through another lifetime, during which we experienced countless setbacks and humiliations, and shed countless amounts of blood, sweat, and tears. Fortunately, our wise leader, Chairman Chiang, led the military and civilians of the whole country in a difficult war of resistance, persevering through countless setbacks and consistently commanding with unwavering resolve, "using constancy to control all changes," and finally overcoming the final difficulties and recovering our lost territories. This not only demonstrates the supreme and unyielding spirit of our nation, but also proves that justice will surely triumph over power, and righteousness will ultimately overcome violence.

Today is the second "September 18th" after our country's victory in the War of Resistance. Our country, both government and people, still commemorate this unforgettable national humiliation day with heavy hearts, not feeling any relief because the aggressors have already surrendered. In the world before us, there are still many problems that have not been solved. Not only is the creation of world peace not easy and international political situations constantly evolving, but there is also the concern that latent aggressive forces have the potential to "not be eradicated by wildfires, but spring back to life with the spring breeze." Even the enemy that we refrained from retaliating against dares to publicly insult the Chinese as the "third kind of people"! We need to be especially vigilant when encountering this anniversary!

First, during the war, far-sighted political and diplomatic figures had already anticipated the difficulty of creating peace after the war. Therefore, even before the end of the war, they advocated that the Allied countries not only needed to cooperate during the war, fighting together on the battlefield to win the final victory, but also needed to unite after the war, working hard diplomatically to create world peace. However, this insightful view seems to have been overshadowed by vulgar and stale hegemonic ideas in the year since the end of the war. The Allied nations that fought shoulder to shoulder on the battlefield now seem to be parting ways again, each going their own way. There is even a feeling of discord regarding the policies adopted towards the former enemy countries. For example, the policies of the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union towards Germany each have subtle differences, and the policies of the United States and the Soviet Union towards Japan are also similar. If this situation is allowed to develop without attempting to remedy it, the result will inevitably only benefit the resurgence of the defeated countries, or they may take the opportunity to reapply their old tricks.

Second, the Allied countries have had considerable success in controlling Germany and Japan. In particular, Japan not only has political democratization, but also its economy and society are relatively stable. In the past year, the traces of a defeated country have gradually disappeared. This is naturally the harvest of our generous policy. However, the Japanese nation has always admired the samurai spirit, believed in the omnipotence of force, and regarded aggression as a virtue. The outdated idea of being "descendants of gods" is deeply ingrained and still erupts everywhere. Therefore, we dare to say that even today, there are still fascist bacteria in Japan. Once the time is ripe, aggressive forces will re-emerge. The current plan is for MacArthur to intensify his work in controlling Japan to eradicate the fascist bacteria in Japan, so that the aggressive warlords will never have a chance to rise again.

Third, human beings are rational animals and should be most receptive to the lessons of history. Critics of the Treaty of Versailles mostly attack France for being too harsh in its treatment of defeated Germany, which led to the people's adherence to the Nazis. Therefore, everyone today advocates that we should never repeat the mistakes of the past and adopt a retaliatory policy towards the defeated countries. During the Paris Peace Conference's discussion of the treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, the British and American representatives held this spirit. Even our Foreign Minister Wang made a speech in Paris, advocating treating Japan with generosity. However, we must say to the countries that have adopted a generous attitude that while retaliatory policies cannot bind the defeated countries and prevent them from ever turning over, generosity should also have its limits. Otherwise, overcorrection is no different from helping the growth of the previous enemy's aggressive forces, which is harmful and unhelpful to both ourselves and others.

Fourth, at the beginning of the September 18th Incident fifteen years ago, all countries in the world regarded it as a "local incident" that was unrelated to the entire world. At that time, only U.S. Secretary of State Stimson believed that Japan's aggression against China was enough to endanger world peace. He repeatedly suggested to Britain to take joint action to stop Japan's aggressive atrocities. Unfortunately, British Foreign Secretary Simon, with his short-sightedness, not only did not agree, but also made pro-Japanese fallacies at the League of Nations meeting in Geneva, which made Japan's aggressive arrogance even higher, eventually leading to the Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War. From this, we can see that world peace is indivisible. In the future, no incident in any corner of the world can be regarded as an event in a single place, and it is no longer possible for major countries to isolate themselves. This kind of view has long been abandoned by the times. If all countries truly want to maintain world peace, they must adopt a policy of preventing problems before they arise, always and everywhere prepared to extinguish the sparks of aggression to ensure the collective security of the world.

Fifth, the League of Nations was originally an organization established after World War I to maintain world peace, and it was responsible for sanctioning any country's aggressive atrocities. However, after the "September 18th" Incident, the League of Nations failed to exert its power against Japan's aggression against China, resulting in its reputation plummeting and gradually declining, eventually dying. This valuable lesson is worth pondering by the authorities of the United Nations. Whether the United Nations organization can be the most effective tool for maintaining world peace depends on whether it can quickly resolve any international disputes. However, the permanent members of the Security Council can exercise their "veto power," making it impossible for the United Nations organization to make any judgments on any major issues involving major powers. This defect is enough to constitute its fatal wound and urgently needs to be remedied. Otherwise, the future of the United Nations organization is still uncertain.

In short, the "September 18th" National Humiliation Day gives us a great encouragement, enough to strengthen our belief that after this unprecedented test, the Chinese nation can be confident that it can conquer any difficulties it encounters in the future. Therefore, looking ahead at the domestic situation, although it currently seems to be in a stalemate, it will eventually be able to break through. At the same time, the "September 18th" National Humiliation Day also gives us a serious lesson, requiring us to be extra vigilant, maintain the fruits of victory, and be prepared and vigilant at all times and places to curb the trend of aggressive forces rising again.

### A New Model for Protective Tariffs

Modern tariffs, except for extremely highly industrialized countries that benefit from free trade or are still bound by unilateral agreements and cannot freely adjust their tax rates, contain a certain degree of protectionist color. In industrially backward countries, this is especially relied upon as the only defense project. It is by no means unjust for any independent country to moderately adjust its tariffs.

Since the victory, foreign goods have flooded in, and many factories have suffered the misfortune of closing or reducing work. Those that have survived are also struggling desperately. Therefore, all parties are loudly calling for and proposing many solutions to save the situation. During the recent general meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council, there were also many such proposals. The government is also aware of this and is not without ideas. Measures such as adjusting foreign exchange rates, abolishing export taxes, providing low-interest loans, and purchasing raw silk have been implemented separately. However, it has always hesitated on the item of raising import taxes, maintaining a very cautious attitude. Although there have been rumors recently about revising import taxes, it is said that the main points are still limited to restricting non-essential goods and prohibiting luxury goods, and there is still no preparation to moderately increase import taxes. The reason for this is nothing more than that the Allied nation of the United States is seeking to flatten tariff barriers, so it does not want to have unique disagreements and disrupt the overall situation. The intention is originally understandable. However, the safety of national industries is related to the life of the country, and protective tariffs are a necessary measure to maintain national industries. There is a distinction between the importance and urgency of these issues, and it is necessary to urgently seek a trade-off to comply with the principle of choosing the greater of two benefits and the lesser of two evils.

As reported by the United Press Washington dispatch in this newspaper yesterday, there is no shortage of precedents for countries adopting this policy. Countries such as India, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Australia have all publicly stated that protective tariffs are indispensable in newly emerging industrial countries. India and other countries are also Allied nations, and their degree of industrialization is above that of our country. Although the United States feels quite troubled, it also gives considerable sympathy and there is no particularly bad reaction. It can be seen that if our country adopts appropriate and reasonable protective tariffs today, it will not cause a lot of difficulties in the international community. Because they are not unaware of the fragility of our country's industry and the oppression of foreign goods currently being suffered. They may even understand it more than we do. Therefore, revising import tariffs and adjusting import tax rates is an urgent matter today, and there seems to be no reason to hesitate. Otherwise, when the oil is dry and the lamp is extinguished, and the people's wealth is exhausted, and there is no longer the purchasing power of foreign goods, it may not be beneficial to the countries that import foreign goods into China.

However, protective tariffs must also meet certain conditions, and careful preparation must be made in advance to achieve the intended purpose. First, the target must be carefully selected. If our country does not have this industry, there is no point in protecting it. The reason why recent people have advocated rewarding the import of goods such as machinery and transportation equipment is this. Second, the tax rate should be raised just to the appropriate level to enable it to compete with foreign goods. If it exceeds this level, it is a revenue principle, not a protective tariff; if it does not reach this level, it loses its protective effect and cannot be considered a protective tariff. Therefore, relying solely on intuition, just trying to save trouble, and vaguely and uniformly raising a certain type of import tax by a few percent is of no help. Third, the industry to be protected must be carefully reviewed in advance. That is to say, is this industry worth protecting? Because of the relationship between the timing or the geography, there is a type of industry that cannot be promoted artificially. There is also a certain industry whose foundation is too weak to be protected, or whose output is too small to meet domestic needs. Then, directly raising tariffs will only indirectly raise prices and increase the burden on the people. For this reason, although we support reasonable protective tariffs, we do not support reckless actions, which would transform them into "fiscal tariffs" in disguise!

### Economic War Prevention Movement

President Truman recently instructed Representative Winant to propose to the United Nations Economic and Social Council that an international conference be convened in the second half of next year to discuss the preservation and use of world resources to improve the living standards of people around the world. This is indeed good news for world peace.

No one can deny that colonies are the lifeblood of imperialism, and world resources are the blood of imperialists. International wars for hundreds of years have been caused by the struggle for colonies and the struggle for world resources. Generally, politicians with lofty ideals have long called for the equal distribution of world resources. Before World War II, the foremost advocate for economic war prevention was Belgian Prime Minister Van Zeeland, who went to the United States to study this issue. Even British Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare gave a speech in the League of Nations, advocating the redistribution of world resources in an attempt to ease Germany's demands for colonies. However, these arguments were mere empty words before the war and did not materialize.

After this war, everyone held beautiful illusions, believing that the Allied countries that fought shoulder to shoulder during the war would be able to cooperate to the end after the war and would never "be blinded by profit" and take up arms against each other again over the struggle for colonies and the struggle for resources. So this problem seems to have been forgotten. Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, went to Paris in June and July of this year to attend the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Seeing the constant waves in the international community, he knew that the future of world peace was not optimistic. After returning to the country, he proposed a plan to prevent World War III. The most important point is: "The United States should fully assist the economic and social welfare programs of the United Nations organization so that it can complete the various conditions necessary to maintain world peace." Connally's opinions on international politics have always been valued by the American government and the public, especially since this plan is his masterpiece, President Truman naturally also pays close attention to it. President Truman's initiative to launch the economic war prevention movement this time was probably also influenced by Connally.

There are two points in President Truman's letter to Winant that are most worthy of our attention. He said, "In the coming decades, atomic energy may be used for peaceful purposes"; he also said, "Preserving world resources may become an important foundation for peace." This is the best explanation for economic war prevention.

The war has ended for just one year, and the god of war is vaguely threatening us again! However, the world after the war is deeply traumatized, who would want to see the re-emergence of war? The only way to avoid war is to appeal to human conscience. The economic war prevention movement is indeed worth advocating at present.

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 17th Radio: Truman has decided to summon Wallace tomorrow (the 18th). Whether Wallace will remain in his current position will be decided at this meeting.

[United Press Washington, 16th] President Truman and Democratic Party Chairman Hannegan consulted for a long time today about the internal division within the cabinet on foreign policy after Secretary of Commerce Wallace announced that he would continue to make public speeches against the government's "tough stance on the Soviet Union" plan.

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 17th Radio: It is expected that Wallace will return to Washington today to hold secret talks with President Truman. If Wallace continues to publish his speeches against the State Department's foreign policy according to his already announced plan, the government will inevitably experience a great shock. Although Wallace claimed that he had no intention of resigning, a cabinet crisis is not entirely impossible. According to reports from Paris, the US delegation is awaiting the results of the meeting between Truman and Wallace and fully believes that the President will support Byrnes, even demanding Wallace's dismissal, or asking him not to involve foreign policy in future speeches, otherwise he will send his private plane "Sacred Cow" to Paris to carry the US delegation back. Conservative members of the Democratic Party are deeply indignant at Wallace and reminded Truman that Wallace was originally a Republican and only joined the Democratic Party during Roosevelt's New Deal, so he should be punished by expelling him from the party. Mrs. Roosevelt also expressed her opinion that "We believe that a certain secretary of the President must not have carefully read Wallace's speech, otherwise the President would never have disregarded Byrnes' reaction. The foreign policy of the United States must be decided by the Secretary of State and the State Department, but the people have the right to understand this policy and express their own opinions. Fear of the Soviet Union has been created domestically, but I believe that this fear lacks reality."

### Wallace Challenges Frankly Still Insists on Original Position Scheduled to Deliver Another Speech Next Tuesday

[United Press Washington, 16th] Secretary of Commerce Wallace today frankly challenged Secretary of State Byrnes again, expressing his adherence to his original position and continuing to attack his so-called "tough stance on the Soviet Union" policy. Wallace, amid the growing cabinet split crisis, spent the weekend holiday returning to Beijing, and immediately talked with President Truman by phone, and immediately issued the following statement: "I insist on the speech I made in New York last Thursday. It is interesting that both the far right and the far left are dissatisfied with my views. I am grateful for the concern of most Americans, and I am willing to continue to work for a fair and lasting peace. I will deliver another speech on this issue in the near future." Wallace is scheduled to deliver a speech in Rhode Island on the 24th of this month. The lecture will be hosted by the National Political Action Committee. Wallace's previous bombing speech at Madison Square in New York was also hosted by the same group. Wallace also intends to engage in speeches throughout the country. Wallace's determination to re-sweep away diplomatic claims not only increases the separation between him and Byrnes, but also expands the rift between his own faction and other members of the Democratic Party. Wallace's speech in New York has been severely criticized by Democratic members in the southern states, with the exception of Senator Pepper of Florida, which is noteworthy

Seeking to Remedy the Damage to Reputation

[Reuters Washington, 16th] US government leaders understand that they are already planning how to remedy the damage to the reputation of US foreign policy and domestic unity caused by Wallace's speech and the President's change of heart. It is expected that Byrnes will soon officially announce the government's foreign policy, especially the part about the Soviet Union, and President Truman will give the statement a solemn approval. Some Americans have demanded that the President take more decisive action against Wallace, and Republican newspapers have launched a "Wallace Must Go" campaign. People close to Wallace said that Wallace will never resign. Wallace believes that his speech is a middle-of-the-road approach between the anti-Soviet and pro-Soviet extremist factions.

I think the United States must establish a defense line along the south coast of Kyushu. The Japanese feel that although they have fought a battle account, the United States is still their best friend. The Soviet Union expressed displeasure with this attitude of the Japanese people, and that is why it demanded more say during the occupation period.

### Ukraine Case

Security Council Discussion Without Result

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 16th dispatch] The United Nations Security Council met successively today to discuss the Ukrainian accusation against Greece. Australian representative Hasluck and Dutch representative Kerstens stated that the Ukrainian representative Manuilsky's accusation against Greece was completely without factual basis. They proposed establishing a subcommittee to determine whether the accusations were reasonable, which would allow the Security Council to reject all libelous or inappropriate demands. Manuilsky immediately followed with a rebuttal. However, British representative Jebb interjected, saying that Manuilsky had not obstructed the Security Council's proceedings, and even Security Council members did not have such a right. Soviet representative Gromyko then proposed a new resolution, demanding that the Security Council compel the Greek government to take steps to stop the activities of Greek aggressors. However, the Security Council did not put Gromyko's proposal to a vote and adjourned immediately, to resume on the 17th.

[Reuters, New York, 16th dispatch] It is expected that after Soviet representative Gromyko takes over as chairman for the second term, the appearance of the Security Council meetings will change significantly, due to the weakness of the outgoing chairman, Polish representative Lange, in handling the recent discussions on the Greek issue.

### Molotov Frankly States: Polish Western Border is Unchangeable; Responds to Byrnes' Policy on Germany

[Reuters, Paris, 16th dispatch] Molotov, in response to Byrnes' recently published policy on Germany, made a special statement today saying: The decision of the Berlin Conference regarding the Polish western border is unchangeable, and the facts also prove that there is no possibility of change at present. This is the position adopted by the Soviet government. Some opinions in Byrnes' speech regarding the Polish western border may cause some doubts about the attitude of the United States towards this issue. However, questions of this nature should not be the subject of political calculations. I continue to hope that Polish friends can complete great construction work in their western lands. I am sure that the friendly cooperation between the two democratic countries of Poland and the Soviet Union will be further promoted.

[Reuters, Paris, 16th dispatch] Byrnes has not yet responded to Molotov's remarks on the Polish western border issue. Byrnes is expected to make some comments on this matter on Tuesday.

### Confrontation Between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States Could Overturn the Fruits of Peace; Roosevelt's Son Writes a Book Describing His Father's Remarks; Believes Hurley Was a Suitable Person to be Stationed in China

[United Press, New York, 16th dispatch] The second excerpt from the book "As He Saw It," written by Elliott Roosevelt, the son of the late President Roosevelt, was published today by "Look" magazine, revealing the inside story of the long wartime debate between Roosevelt and Churchill. Regarding the overall offensive plan of the Allied forces, Churchill originally advocated starting with invasions of Malaya and the Balkans, while Roosevelt strongly supported the plan of US Army Chief of Staff Marshall to land in Normandy, northern France. After a long debate, Marshall's strategy was adopted. In the Pacific, according to Roosevelt, the British also opposed MacArthur's island-hopping strategy and advocated going north along the Chinese coast to obtain a base for attacking the Japanese mainland, not understanding the importance of the Philippine base to the US military. Roosevelt explained this by saying: "Perhaps the British believe that the people of their colonies will not support their operations, and therefore they don't understand that the Filipinos will flock to our flag." Regarding the Balkans, Roosevelt said: "Churchill is deeply afraid of allowing the Soviet Union to become too powerful, which may make it strong in Europe; but whether this is a bad thing depends on many factors. I do not advocate putting the lives of American soldiers in danger to protect the true or imagined British interests in Europe." In Roosevelt's view, the greatest achievement of the Tehran Conference was to explain to Stalin that the United States and Britain were not forming a joint group to oppose the Soviet Union. Roosevelt also said: "One thing that would overturn the post-war apple cart is the most extreme division in the world, with the Soviet Union confronting the United Kingdom and the United States." According to Elliott Roosevelt, his father was sincerely fond of Stalin.

The book also mentions a section about China, saying that the former US Ambassador to China, Hurley, was considered a "suitable person" in Roosevelt's work in China. According to Roosevelt's telling his son: "I can order Hurley to do things that I don't want people in the State Department to do. In the past, people in the State Department have secretly kept official documents and telegrams to me from my knowledge, or deliberately delayed them, or even kept them without sending them." Regarding Stalin and the veto issue, Elliott said that Roosevelt agreed with Stalin at the 1943 Tehran Conference that it was necessary to use individual vetoes to ensure the unity of action of the three powers. Roosevelt also believed that the unity of action of the three powers was necessary for the post-war world.

At the same time, if the port of Trieste becomes an international port and is completely separated from the Yugoslav mainland, Yugoslavia will cut off the port's lifeline.

[United Press, Washington, 16th dispatch] According to official statistics, about one in three new families established in the United States last year broke up. More than 502,000 marriages ended in divorce shortly after marriage last year, more than 25 percent higher than the peak in 1944, setting a new record. The number of marriages last year reached 1,618,331, with divorces accounting for 31 percent.

[United Press, Paris, 16th dispatch] The French Ministry of Population has established a plan to encourage childbirth, stipulating that married couples can obtain marriage loans of 80,000 to 100,000 francs, which can be repaid in installments over ten years. For each child born, the debt will be reduced by 20,000 francs. If five children are born, the loan will be considered fully repaid. According to the ministry's announcement today, if France wants to maintain its current population in the next 100 years, each family should have an average of three children. Every poor large family should be given subsidies equal to half of the income of the head of the household to maintain their living standards. France lost 3 million strong young men in the two world wars, and the above measures can make up for the lost population.

### Bevin's Remarks at the London Conference: Federalization of Palestine; United Kingdom Considers Recognizing the Arab League; Protests to Both Jewish Thugs and Arabs

[United Press, London, 16th dispatch] Foreign Secretary Bevin's speech at the London Conference today answered in detail all criticisms of the Palestine federalization plan and guaranteed that all proposed amendments would be given due consideration, allowing Palestine to eventually become fully independent.

[United Press, London, 16th dispatch] The British government is now considering recognizing the Arab League, but may not establish formal diplomatic relations with the organization. It is only to facilitate future negotiations between the UK and its member states through the organization. Since the Arab League is a permanent conference of Arab countries, recognition is more important in administrative terms than in political terms.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 16th dispatch] Huseini, the leader of the Palestinian Arabs, protested to British Commissioner Sir Alan Cunningham, declaring that if terrorist organizations persist in attacking Arabs, the Arab community will take direct action to deal with the terrorist acts.

### Japan's New Constitution; Special Correspondent Fu Junyi Reports from Tokyo

After six weeks of deliberation by the House of Representatives, Japan's new constitution was finally passed unanimously on August 25 and sent to the House of Peers, where it is currently being reviewed article by article. This constitutional amendment is the biggest focus of debate in the 90th extraordinary session of the Japanese parliament. According to the reasons stated by the Japanese Emperor in his imperial rescript at the opening ceremony of the parliament, the Japanese government's motivation for submitting the constitutional amendment to the parliament this time is: "Based on the supreme will of the people, I respect their basic human rights, so that the freedom and welfare of the people can be permanently ensured, and all obstacles to strengthening the trend of democracy can be eliminated, and war can be abandoned to seek permanent peace in the world. Therefore, I am willing to completely revise the constitution that expresses the free will of the people and lay the foundation of the country." In fact, the main reason is, of course, to show Japan's sincerity in fulfilling the Potsdam Declaration. At the same time, this is also the obligation imposed on Japan by the Potsdam Declaration, so MacArthur is particularly concerned about this new constitutional bill. On the second day the bill was submitted to parliament (June 21), regarding the deliberation of the bill, an important statement was issued, saying that (1) sufficient time and opportunity must be given for the deliberation of each article of the constitution; (2) the continued validity of the current constitution promulgated in Meiji 22 should be confirmed in law; (3) the voting on each article of the constitution should be determined by the freely expressed will of the Japanese people. This shows MacArthur's emphasis on the bill, and it also shows that the current constitution is allowed to continue to exist in some places. The newly revised constitution has a total of eleven chapters and 103 articles. In addition to the preamble, the first chapter is the Emperor, with the Emperor as the symbol of national unity. The second chapter is the abandonment of war, excluding all force. The third chapter is the rights and obligations of the people, and the people enjoy all basic human rights. The fourth chapter is the parliament, divided into the House of Councilors and the House of Representatives. The fifth chapter is the cabinet, stipulating that the prime minister is nominated by members of parliament, that is, the system of the majority party in power. The sixth chapter is the judiciary, judicial independence, and all judicial power belongs to the Supreme Court. The seventh chapter is finance, and the power to handle national finance must be based on the decision of the parliament, and the expenses of the imperial family must also be approved by the parliament. The eighth chapter is local autonomy, and the heads of local public organizations must be elected by residents. The ninth chapter is the amendment of the constitution, which must be voted on by the people. The tenth chapter is the supreme law, respecting human rights and international treaties. The eleventh chapter is supplementary provisions. The characteristic of this revision

of the new constitution is to give this new constitution the character of a national constitution (not the people), so the terms national constitution and Japanese nationals are used in the preamble to the constitution. As for the national polity, according to the government's explanation, it will not be changed. It is said that the characteristic of the Japanese national polity is that the Emperor and the people are united as one in the depths of the hearts of the people, and the Emperor is the center of aspiration. Regarding the issue of where sovereignty lies, the provision in the preamble is in the people, not the people, and this people includes the Emperor. The Emperor's position is a symbol of the Japanese state. According to the government's explanation, it is difficult to understand the integration of the Japanese state by observing it with the naked eye. Only when looking up to the Emperor can the situation of the Japanese state emerge before our eyes. Regarding the point of declaring the abandonment of war, Japanese newspapers and foreign reporters have praised it greatly. In fact, the most progressive point of the new constitution is Chapter 3, which confirms all the basic human rights of the people, such as the right to work and the right to collective bargaining. In the House of Representatives,

the focus of the debate was Article 1 of the constitution, which stipulates that the Emperor is the symbol of the Japanese people and the symbol of the integration of the Japanese state. The Emperor's position is based on the supreme will of the Japanese people. In its reply to the parliament this time, the government tried to avoid using the word people as much as possible, while MacArthur clearly stated in his statement that all power should be placed in the hands of the people. In his reply to the House of Representatives, State Minister Kanamori only acknowledged that sovereignty was in the entire body of the people, including

the Emperor. Later, it was considered that the meaning of this sentence was very ambiguous, and it was revised again, saying that sovereignty was in the people, including the Emperor. In other words, the Emperor and the general public are constituent members of the people. The concept of the people refers to the people who constitute the country, and the monarch is also included. The element that constitutes a free country, the people, is the nation. The Liberal Party adopts the theory of national sovereignty, that sovereignty is composed of the Emperor and the people, while the Socialist Party believes that sovereignty is in the cooperative body of the people including the Emperor. Everyone distinguishes clearly between the concepts of national and people, so they are unwilling to use the phrase sovereignty resides in the people, and they support sovereignty resides in the nation, because if it is said that sovereignty resides in the people, the Emperor's position will become very obvious, and he will lose his value. Of course, the people are referring to the monarch, including the monarch. Isn't the people a contradiction? Although the current constitution claims to be a national constitution, not the subjects' constitution of the past, to whom does sovereignty belong in the end? Is it the nation or the people? No wonder Japanese commentator Yasuzo Suzuki said: We in the academic community believe that the new constitution should be completely different from the old constitution in

fundamental principles, but there is a political force that wants to continue the principles of the old constitution in the new constitution. Although this new constitution has some contradictory points in theory, especially the lack of clear provisions regarding the issue of sovereignty, it still stipulates the Emperor's position too high. However, the influence of progressives, such as the arguments of the Socialist Party, played a big role. In the general election in April, both the Liberal and Progressive parties advocated entrusting sovereignty to the ruler and the state, but this time they actually first agreed to the claim that sovereignty lies in the nation, and the Liberal Party proposed to amend Article 84 regarding the provisions of the imperial family property, advocating that all imperial family property should belong to the state. This illustrates the speculative mentality of conservatives catering to the current trend. As for

the attitude of the Communist Party, it completely denies the Emperor system. Nosaka Sanzo said in his speech in parliament: All countries should have the armed forces of self-defense in law. Denying the existence of the minimum armed forces is equivalent to denying the independence of the country and the race. But how will the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration on the disarmament of Japan be fulfilled? How will the Communist Party's slogans of no homeland and opposition to war be self-justified? The current school newspaper constitution is currently being reviewed by the House of Peers, and it is generally believed that there will not be much modification. At most, it will only be a modification of the wording. According to today's Yomiuri Shimbun, it will be passed in the House of Peers plenary session on the 25th of this month. After the House of Peers passes it, the Emperor will officially announce it. The spokesperson of the Washington Far Eastern Commission also said: The new constitution will be recognized soon, so the establishment of the new Japanese constitution is only a matter of time. (The End)

### Questioning the Work of the Executive Yuan's Shanghai Branch; Liu Hongsheng Becomes the Target of Public Criticism; City Council Cables the Government to Negotiate the Recovery of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau; To Listen to the Report of the Enemy Property Administration Today

[This newspaper report] At the 12th meeting of the City Council yesterday morning, Liu Hongsheng, director of the Shanghai Branch of the Executive Yuan, was specially invited to attend to report on the relief situation in the Shanghai area and answer questions. The councilors were very concerned about the work of the Executive Yuan and asked questions very enthusiastically. Director Liu answered part of them verbally, and the rest were answered in detail in writing.

Following the report and inquiry of the Executive Yuan, the meeting began to discuss the civil affairs proposal. The 13th meeting in the afternoon continued, and the discussion was quite exciting, resolving ten proposals. At yesterday's meeting, it was passed that the address of the City Council would be located at the original site of the former Japanese Residents' Association, and it was also passed to cable the government to negotiate the recovery of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and other cases.

The 14th meeting will be held this morning, and the person in charge of the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration will attend to report on the progress of the work. Then, five unfinished civil affairs cases will be discussed, and if time permits, proposals on finance, industry, commerce, and economy will be discussed. The fourth review meeting will be held in the afternoon.

The policy report of the Shanghai Branch of the Executive Yuan and the councilors' questions about the work of the Executive Yuan were the focus of yesterday morning's meeting agenda. Director Liu Hongsheng and Deputy Director Wang Renlin both personally appeared, and most of the responsible persons at all levels of the branch also attended.

Director Liu briefly read out the work report of the branch, and said that he was willing to leave more time for the councilors to ask questions. The content of the report was like a general cash flow statement, and detailed figures were printed and distributed separately. He said: The Shanghai Branch was established in October last year, and as of the end of August this year, the relief work in the past ten months is as follows: (1) Regular relief: distributing materials to Chinese and foreign organizations to relieve the elderly, weak, disabled, and abandoned. (2) Temporary relief: such as setting up porridge distribution stations and shelters. (3) Suburban relief: dispatching work teams to the suburbs to distribute relief in stages. (4) Relief for civilians: setting up refugee transfer stations and reception centers. (5) Relief for unemployed workers: establishing a temporary committee and issuing flour to maintain their livelihood. (6) Carrying out work-for-relief programs such as dredging riverbanks and clearing garbage. (7) Distributing milk powder and flour to schools at all levels. (8) Setting up summer children's recreation stations to accommodate poor children. In addition, the work done in terms of health includes: (1) allocating beds and equipment to assist hospitals in repatriation, (2) establishing clinics, (3) establishing free beds and sending free patients, (4) organizing health inspection teams, (5) establishing dental training courses, (6) establishing milk powder distribution stations, (7) establishing cod liver oil distribution stations, (8) establishing children's milk drinking stations, (9) allocating 400 beds to assist in epidemic prevention. As for the future work, the Nanjing review meeting at the beginning of this month decided to focus on post-disaster recovery.

As soon as the report was finished, the councilors' questions were raised one after another, and Director Liu became the target of public criticism.

The picture above shows Liu Hongsheng, Director of the Shanghai Branch of the Executive Yuan, giving a report.

The picture below shows Deputy Director Wang Renlin answering questions (photographed by this newspaper).

### Regarding the Aftermath, Not the Beforehand: The Poor Only Receive Coffins After Death; They Cannot Obtain Relief in Life: Senators Jointly Question

Zhang Zhihan asked: When the epidemic raged this summer, the municipal government contacted the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERR Administration) for trucks to clear garbage, but the ERR Administration insisted on cash transactions. Only after much negotiation was a portion loaned. May I ask if the ERR Administration has become an organization that "has its own way of making money"? The past is gone, but the garbage problem is still serious. I hope the ERR Administration can allocate more vehicles to help the municipal government.

Mei Hao asked: (1) How much material and funding has the Shanghai branch received? (2) How exactly are these materials and funds being used? (3) How much of the materials have rotted? (4) How much material is left? (5) What are the future improvement plans?

Zhang Xuelian asked: The Shanghai branch has three "many"s: First, there are many cars, and the streets are full of cars from the Relief Administration. Instead of letting branch staff enjoy these cars, why not use them to relieve famine? Second, there are many moldy materials. It is better to not have the materials than to let them rot. This can save on shipping costs and take up less warehouse space. Third, there are many cases of selling relief materials for fees. In the past, if relief efforts were poorly managed, one would "lose one's head." Now, there is no such method. But if this continues, all relief items will probably be listed on the exchange. When the branch was established, were there any plans and steps?

Zhuang Ping asked: Regarding the "hidden poor," especially those in the impoverished education and culture circles, why are some unable to obtain relief even after applying repeatedly?

Hou Junren asked: The damage suffered by the suburbs of this city, such as Jiangwan Dachang, during the Anti-Japanese War was more severe than in the urban areas. Why is the relief they receive now so little?

In addition to Hou Junren's questions, Jia Dechao also asked: (1) The work of the ERR Administration can truly be said to "be good at the aftermath but not the beforehand." For example, the poor on the street receive coffins after death but cannot obtain relief when they are alive. And for example, with epidemic prevention, relief only comes after the epidemic rages. Why not prevent it beforehand? (2) Very few people receive cod liver oil. What exactly is the reason?

Shao Yongsheng separated "relief" and "aftermath" in his remarks. He asked: "If relief materials are sold for fees, what is the meaning of relief? The ERR Administration lacked the spirit of universal love and compassion when planning. It is like writing an essay and forgetting the topic. I hope that future work will not repeat the mistakes of relief efforts, that the organization will not be too large, and that drastic reforms will be implemented."

Lu Keming asked: "In the statistical report, old clothes and shoes are calculated in packages. May I ask how many items are in a package? It is said that many stores in the market sell old suits that come from the Relief Administration. Is this true?

He Chengfu supplemented Lu's questions and specifically cited a store selling old suits at the intersection of Linsen Road and Sinan Road as an example.

Ding Shanming asked the branch to liaise with the Public Works Bureau and other departments to use the method of "work-for-relief" more often to promote suburban construction.

Ma Junshuo asked: "The branch received more than 6,000 packages of old clothes, but only more than 2,000 packages have been distributed. The branch received more than 1,500 packages of old shoes, but only more than 900 packages have been distributed. How will the rest be handled? What are the distribution standards? The number of items in each package should be clearly calculated."

### The Office of the City Council Has a Location: Established at the Former Site of the Japanese Residents' Association

After the ERR Administration finished reporting and answering questions, there was a ten-minute break before the meeting continued. The Speaker reported that he had inspected the proposed site for the City Council with the Mayor on the afternoon of the 15th. The Shanghai Theater on North Sichuan Road was badly damaged, and the estimated repair cost was 300 million yuan, so it was not suitable. The building of the former Japanese Residents' Association on Peng Road was still intact and large enough. However, it is currently leased by the U.S. Navy Club, and the lease expires in mid-November. It will be contacted with the Enemy Property Administration to not renew the lease at that time and request the government to allocate it as the site of this council.

Finally, the proposal that had been reviewed by the First Subcommittee was discussed. Due to time constraints, only the first proposal in the "Min" (Civil Affairs) category, "Strengthening the Powers of Local Autonomous Organizations in this City to Promote Local Self-Government," was amended and passed before the meeting adjourned.

### Liu Hongsheng Calmly Answers Questions About Old Clothes in Taiwan: "I Am Not an Inquirer; Only Heaven Knows."

The questioning came to a temporary end. Director Liu calmly walked to the podium. He first said: "Everyone is not very satisfied with the Shanghai branch, but the other branches all say that I, Liu Hongsheng, have a way to bring everything to Shanghai." Then he said: (1) The most unfair thing is about the garbage truck. There is garbage in front of my own door. However, the sale of materials is the responsibility of the General Administration, which the branch cannot interfere with. And it is still in use, and ten more vehicles have been lent to other health agencies. As for whether I am helping or not, you can ask Director Zhang of the Health Bureau. (2) The branch has only three Jeeps in total. One is for foreign personnel sent by the General Administration, one is for personnel distributing relief goods, and one is for staff to share. I myself have never sat in one. (3) Some of the so-called moldy materials, such as skim milk powder and flour, have slightly different colors due to different quality components, but they are not actually moldy. (4) It is difficult to say for sure whether the ERR Administration has a complete plan. I say there is a plan, but some things like epidemic prevention cannot be predicted in advance. (5) There is less relief in the suburbs because the relief is based on the number of people. For example, epidemic prevention work is due to the fact that there are more patients in the city center. (6) Whether the old clothes sold in stores are relief items is something that I would have to investigate. Perhaps we gave them to refugees, and the refugees sold them themselves. In addition, merchants can also directly order from the United States and Canada. As far as I know, the price is US$3.50 per pound. (7) The distribution of cod liver oil must be based on a doctor's certificate, because it is not tap water that can be drawn endlessly and distributed to everyone. (8) The number of items in each package of old clothes and shoes is "Heaven Knows." Even the foreigners themselves do not know. (9) The income from the sale of materials is used as funding due to practical difficulties, because although the government has a budget for the Relief Administration, it has not yet been allocated. (10) Relief for the "hidden poor" is not within the scope of relief agreed upon by the General Administration and UNRRA and is not within the jurisdiction of the branch.

Continued Questioning

Zhang Zhihan stood up to refute the Director's statement that "Heaven Knows" regarding the number of items in each package of old clothes. He asked why they could not be opened and counted clearly.

Deputy Director Wang Renlin came to the stage to defuse the situation. He added two points: (1) The meaning of "hidden poor" is difficult to determine. It has now been stipulated to divide them into two categories: ordinary and education/culture. (2) The contents of each package of old clothes range from baby diapers to dancing dresses. There is everything. In the past, schools have been used to set up sorting stations for sorting and altering them. Although schools have now started, efforts will still be made to continue.

It was already 11 o'clock. Although the Speaker had announced the end of oral questioning, many councilors were still speaking from their seats. Wang Weiyan asked what measures the ERR Administration has to improve the fact that the U.S. side is dissatisfied with its work. Fei Shusheng believes that the ERR Administration is too Westernized and that relief should be handled more by domestic agencies. Sun Zhenchun pointed out that the councilors' questions were not malicious and did not regard Director Liu as an "inquirer." In addition, he asked the ERR Administration to pay more attention to relief in the suburbs. Qu Yue also specifically proposed that relief efforts should pay more attention to the suburbs. Zhuang Ping repeatedly insisted that Director Liu give a positive answer regarding relief for the "hidden poor."

Another Reply

Director Liu reiterated that his jurisdiction is limited to the Shanghai branch, so regarding the dissatisfaction of the U.S. side with the work of the ERR Administration, he said that the U.S. side is quite satisfied with the Shanghai branch. As for the Westernized aspect, it is inevitable because the materials basically come from abroad. However, all domestic agencies have been contacted to take on relief work. In addition, he expressed his acceptance of the councilors' suggestions and that he would pay attention to relief work in the suburbs in the future. A series of questions, a series of answers, the atmosphere was quite tense, and Director Liu was obviously a little exhausted. When Chang Zhu Xuefan asked about the overall relief policy of the ERR Administration, his answers were somewhat irrelevant. Finally, Zhan Wenhun stood up and said: "The answers to questions should not be vague and perfunctory. If you want to say something responsible, if you cannot answer verbally, it is better to answer in writing."

At this point, the Speaker decided to end the oral questioning and answer the remaining questions in writing.

### Anecdotes from the Meeting

Yesterday, the councilors' questioning of the ERR Administration was unprecedentedly intense. Liu Hongsheng was parrying left and right, and he coughed several times from exhaustion. After stepping down from the podium, he took out his handkerchief to wipe his sweat several times. In fact, most of the questions were directed at the entire ERR Administration, and as the director of the Shanghai branch, he can be said to be "taking the blame for others."

Liu Hongsheng's report on the work of the Shanghai branch was concise, but it was too hasty. His answers to the councilors' questions were straightforward, but the "Shanghai style" was too strong.

The councilors' gestures when speaking were quite interesting. Some waved their arms and feet, some shook their heads, some were as still as chickens, and some were restless. Yesterday, a councilor wearing a long gown walked to the microphone, holding the manuscript in one hand and lifting the long gown with the other, which was very comical.

Deputy Director Wang Renlin said that there were many high-heeled shoes among the relief items. They were not suitable for distribution to refugees, and foreigners did not agree to auctioning them off, saying that they hoped that the clothes and shoes they donated could be worn directly by the refugees. He asked the councilors to think of a way to handle them.

After the Speaker announced a ten-minute break yesterday morning, everyone left their seats to refresh themselves. Suddenly, a large mercury lamp in the upper right corner of the second floor was blown down by a strong wind. Fortunately, no one was walking by at this time, and no one was sitting in their seat. Otherwise, there would have been bloodshed in the City Council.

Wu Shaoshu returned to Shanghai from Lushan the night before last and attended the City Council for the first time yesterday. In the morning, he shook hands with acquaintances when he saw them, and those who knew him came over to greet him, which kept him busy.

After Liu Hongsheng finished his report, he said: "If any of you councilors have any questions to ask, I am prepared to be 'interrogated' by you." After hearing the councilors say that the Shanghai branch's relief efforts were inadequate, he quickly said "unjust" and solemnly declared: "I, Liu Hongsheng, was born in Shanghai, grew up in Shanghai, and plan to die in Shanghai, so I will not be sloppy with the relief efforts in Shanghai."

Fu Tongxian made a point, asking the municipal government to pay more attention to the health and welfare of suburban residents. He said: "There is a creek in western Shanghai called 'Stinky Creek.' The word 'stinky' has become a technical term and is famous, which is a real disgrace to Shanghai!"

### The City Council Discussed Proposals on Civil Affairs Yesterday; the Issue of Allocating Temples Aroused Heated Debate

Yesterday afternoon, the City Council continued to discuss proposals related to civil affairs, specifically proposals 2 through 10 in the "Min" (Civil Affairs) category. Among them, proposal 3, regarding "Please the Municipal Government to Allocate Office Buildings to Autonomous Organizations to Facilitate the Promotion of Autonomy," sparked much debate among the councilors regarding the allocation of temples. Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, made some explanations, which were somewhat intense, and included the clever remark that "If the district offices and others do not have houses, I, the Director of Civil Affairs, will quit." Some councilors felt that this was inappropriate. Zhang Xiaosong then voluntarily went on stage to apologize. The councilors applauded, the misunderstanding was dispelled, and everyone was happy.

The review opinion for proposal 3 listed five measures, the second of which, "Allocate Temples and Public Buildings," caused the controversy. Councilor Wang Zhengting stood up and said: "The general public builds temples with their own intentions, and public buildings also have their own purposes. Autonomous organizations should not apply for allocation, taking what others have spent money to build for their own use, which is most inappropriate. Therefore, this item should be canceled." The councilors applauded greatly. Zhu Wende said: "It is okay to change 'allocate' to 'borrow'." Wang Zhengting said again: "Borrowing is excellent, but all buildings can be borrowed, not limited to temples and public buildings, so there is no need to specify it." The councilors applauded even more after he finished speaking. At this time, the Speaker said: "Now we will vote on this point." Wang Jian'e suddenly stood up and explained the difficult situation of district office housing. Zhang Xiaosong gave a more detailed explanation. The mood of the councilors changed, and the motion to abolish this measure was not passed. Finally, the second measure that was passed was "Allocate or Borrow Temples and Public Buildings."

Reducing Redundant Personnel

Proposal 2 was originally "Propose that the Municipal Government Reduce Personnel and Curtail Government Spending to Lighten the Burden on the Municipal Treasury, and at the Same Time Increase Compensation to Enhance Administrative Efficiency." After discussion, the councilors believed that the compensation of civil servants was regulated by the central government and that the municipal government had no authority to independently increase it, so it was changed to "Establish Welfare Programs for Employees in Service." The phrase "to lighten the burden on the municipal treasury" was also deleted. Regarding one of the measures, Feng Youzhen expressed his opinion that "Unimportant redundant personnel should be appropriately reduced" was inappropriate, because how can there be a distinction between important and unimportant redundant personnel? He suggested changing it to "Redundant personnel should be reduced immediately," which was passed.

Delineation of Provincial and Municipal Boundaries

Proposal 4 in the "Min" (Civil Affairs) category was "The Delineation of Provincial and Municipal Boundaries Has Not Been Resolved, Resulting in Conflicting Policies and a Lack of Direction. It Should Be Resolved Quickly to Facilitate Jurisdiction." Two measures were resolved and passed: (1) Request the Municipal Government to consult with the Jiangsu Provincial Government to continue discussions on the boundary issue and make a concrete resolution as soon as possible. (2) In areas that are currently included in this city but still have disputes, police agencies should be established at the same time as autonomous organizations have been established to exercise police power.

Suburban Construction

Proposal 6 was "Request the Municipal Government to Promptly Formulate a Plan for the Construction of the Suburbs of this City to Beautify the City and Benefit Development." The measures were divided into five categories: public utilities, sanitation, education, public security, and others. Fu Tongxian said that suburban construction is more important and more urgent than urban construction. He also suggested that the case be "handed over to the relevant departments of the municipal government for planning and gradual implementation," which was passed.

Replacing Puppet Officials

Proposal 7 was "Request the Municipal Government and Various Bureaus to Promptly Replace Puppet Officials." Because the central government had already made a decision on this point, it was resolved to "hand it over to the municipal government to handle in accordance with the notices issued by the Executive Yuan and Examination Yuan on August 9, 1946."

Regarding proposal 10, "Propose to Commend the Martyrs and Civilians of this City Who Died in the Anti-Japanese War and Provide Compensation to Their Families to Encourage Loyalty," some people had proposed that the case be withdrawn, but most councilors felt that withdrawal was inappropriate, so it was resolved to "request the government to handle it."

As for proposal 5, regarding "Review the Execution of Cases Passed by the Former Provisional City Council," the review method was "submit it to the various specialized committees for handling." After deliberation by the general assembly, it was decided to temporarily retain the case and discuss it together when discussing the proposal of the tenth group on specialized committees. Regarding proposal 8, "Severely Punish Corruption to Comply with the Rule of Law," the general assembly decided to withdraw it, because cleaning up officialdom is a policy rigorously enforced by the government, and civil servants who are corrupt are severely punished, so the City Council does not need to make another resolution. Regarding proposal 9, "Establish Municipal Opinion Boxes in Various Thoroughfares to Adopt Public Opinion and Benefit Municipal Innovation," because the City Council has always accepted people's statements and denunciations, submitting them directly to the City Council is far more convenient than submitting them to the "Municipal Opinion Box," so it was decided to withdraw it.

They did not want to take this opportunity to be promoted and become wealthy.

### An Interlude of Allocating Temple Property: Wang Zhengting Deliberates, Cites Evidence, and Battles a Group of Scholars; Zhang Xiaosong Gives an Impassioned Speech and Scolds Monks

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, the weather was gloomy, and the atmosphere in the City Council hall was also gloomy. The thirteenth meeting discussed civil affairs proposals. Councilors argued over the wording of a proposal, one thinking it needed to be amended, another feeling that supplementary opinions were necessary, and another disagreeing. After discussing it back and forth for a long time, just as everyone was feeling bored and tasteless, a scene suddenly occurred, instantly seeming to give everyone a shot of revitalizing energy. …

When the general assembly resolved civil affairs proposal 3, "Propose that the Municipal Government Allocate Office Buildings to Autonomous Organizations to Facilitate the Promotion of Autonomy," several councilors expressed their opinions on the second clause in the measures, "Allocate Temples and Public Buildings." Councilor Wang Zhengting was reporting for duty for the first time yesterday, and he was very dissatisfied with the word "allocate." He said: Temples are built by the common people with their own money. Regardless of whether they are useful or not, they are always people's private property. We cannot arbitrarily allocate houses built with other people's money. If we can allocate privately owned temples, then we can arbitrarily allocate anyone's house.

Later, Gong Xiahe, Chen Baotai, and others proposed changing "allocate" to "borrow." But this old diplomat shook his head again. He said: Borrowing can refer to any house, and private houses can also be borrowed. There is no need to stipulate this in the measures at all.

Perhaps seeing that several councilors could not solve this problem, Zhang Xiaosong, director of the Civil Affairs Department, could not restrain his emotions and asked to speak. He raised his voice and said: "Although temples are private property, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Executive Yuan have already issued orders that temples can be used to run local autonomous undertakings." Suddenly, he thought of the district office being driven out when it borrowed a temple, and he immediately became angry and his hair stood on end. The more he spoke, the more indignant he became: "The monks in Jing'an Temple, Jade Buddha Temple, and others smoke opium, drink alcohol, and gamble. Why can't we use their temples as district offices?" Then he picked up a notebook and slammed it on the table, shouting loudly: "If this matter is not handled well, I will not be the director of civil affairs." Although Director Zhang's impassioned words won enthusiastic applause, they also caused adverse consequences.

Wang Yansong spoke: "I am a good friend of Director Zhang personally, but from the standpoint of a councilor, Director Zhang seems to be a little out of line today. The fact that monks eat, drink, gamble should be reported to the municipal government for handling according to law. There is no need to say this to us in the City Council." Following that, Zhuang Horen also raised a "protest": "The City Council is a body of public opinion. If we want to decide a case, there is a voting method that can be followed. We should not coerce with 'leaving' or 'staying.' Director Zhang's attitude today is very inappropriate, and I think it is necessary to formally apologize to the councilors.

In the quiet two minutes of tense atmosphere, Director Zhang bravely walked onto the podium. With a very sincere attitude, he said: "When we are implementing democratic politics, we must indeed make decisions on everything based on public opinion. Because I have suffered a lot for the district office in the past ten months, I spoke a little more intensely today. I accept your opinions and apologize to everyone." "However, I still hope that you will find a way to solve the problem of the district office." Director Zhang's short words moved everyone very much.

Afterwards, Wang Yansong said to Wang Zhengting: "Today is your first day reporting for duty, and I, on the other hand, caused a disaster with my first speech."

From the conversations of several councilors, we came to a conclusion about the storm yesterday: "Although Director Zhang's attitude yesterday, his words were a bit too much, we can all understand Director Zhang's difficulties and his straightforwardness and sincerity, especially his spirit of being able to bend and stretch, which is worthy of our respect. Therefore, this party, other Hongmen brothers, if they can promote the spirit of Hongmen and serve the country and nation, I am very happy, because different paths lead to the same goal, and our ultimate goal is still the same." Situ also said that in the future, after the leaders of the overseas Chinese who returned to the country to prepare for the formation of a party leave the country, the headquarters of the Democratic Constitutionalist Party will still have overseas representatives stationed to participate and maintain contact. The party has more than three million members at home and abroad, and all funding is self-raised. This 82-year-old leader of the Democratic Constitutionalist Party, after seeing and hearing what he had seen and heard after returning to the country, said with emotion, "The way compatriots at home get along with each other is very different from the love and sincerity of the overseas Chinese abroad." Situ also said that he will soon go to Beijing to meet with the Chairman.

### Case of Counterfeit Money Manufacturing in Linhuai: Four Suspects Arrested in Shanghai

[Report from this Newspaper] Recently, a large number of 2,000-yuan counterfeit banknotes of the Central Bank were discovered in Linhuai County, Northern Anhui. Local troops investigated and found that the headquarters of the counterfeit money operation was located in the Chunhua Inn in the county. When personnel were dispatched to investigate, the inn owner, Zhu Xuntian, and his wife, Zhu Cheng, had already fled to Nanjing upon hearing the news. They used the large amount of counterfeit money to buy opium in Nanjing and stored it at Ma Jiliang's place at No. 29 Neiqiao Street. The Nanjing and Shanghai Garrison Headquarters were immediately notified, and three suspects were arrested in Shanghai. According to their confession, approximately ten million yuan in counterfeit money had been handed over to Wang Leru, who had previously served as the Deputy Commander of the puppet Yangtze River First Column. He had many followers and was more reliable in using and selling opium in Nanjing and Shanghai. He maintained long-term rooms in hotels such as the Far East Hotel in Shanghai. Based on this confession, the Garrison Headquarters dispatched personnel to investigate for several days and finally arrested him in Room 219 of the Wugong Hotel and seized part of the counterfeit money. He is currently being interrogated by the Military Law Department.

### Extortion Using Forged Secret Accusation Letter: Three Accomplices' Trial Concluded, Awaiting Sentence

[Report from this Newspaper] At 5:00 PM on June 12th of this year, Zhu Jingqing, a lieutenant officer from the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters, along with Lu Shouqi, Wang Changsong, Li Yongkang, and others, went to Wang Wenqin's house at No. 9, Lane 24, Yongping Road. They presented a forged secret accusation letter, accusing Wang of having served as the captain of the puppet Ningbo Water Patrol and of being suspected of being a traitor. They threatened him with arrest and extorted 700,000 yuan. Wang pretended to negotiate and agreed to pay 300,000 yuan first, with the remaining 400,000 yuan to be paid later. He then managed to excuse himself to report the incident to the police, who arrested all the suspects.

### U.S. Army News Liaison Office in Shanghai: Female Soldier Wu Fengmei, Grew Up in America, Returns to Homeland for the Second Time

She Says Female Soldiers All Hope to Make a Chinese Friend; Impression of Shanghai Women: Petite, Bright, and Delicate

[Special Report from this Newspaper] The number of female U.S. soldiers stationed in Shanghai once reached two to three hundred at its peak, but most have gradually withdrawn to their home country. The remaining female soldiers will all leave Shanghai by the end of this month at the latest. Most will be transferred to work in Beiping and Nanjing, while others will return to their hometowns.

Sergeant Clerk Wu Fengmei of the U.S. Army News Liaison Office grew up in the United States, but her parents are both Chinese. Under the influence of her parents, she developed a particularly strong love for China. She likes to eat Chinese food, especially Cantonese cuisine, and she loves to wear Chinese clothes, especially the short jackets and long pants that were popular last year. She said, "It's more flexible to wear these kinds of clothes!" She also has a considerable appreciation for the current short cheongsam, believing that this style is more reasonable, so she made one for herself in yellow, because yellow is her favorite color.

Chinese People are Most Nationalistic

Miss Wu was born in Salem, Oregon, a quiet little village with only two Chinese families. Because Chinese people like to gather with their compatriots, they mostly concentrate in lively areas such as San Francisco and New York. Miss Wu said that Chinese people are the most nationalistic, including her mother, who believes that everything Chinese is good!

Miss Wu first came to China in 1924, and has been to Guangdong and Hong Kong. Coming back this time, she feels that many changes have taken place. When asked about her impression of Shanghai, she frowned and said, "Everything is very good, but it's too hot. I have never been to such a hot place in my life!" When the reporter told her that this was an exception even in Shanghai, she replied with a smile, "Then I'm just unlucky." Because there are always many new stimulations when you come to a new place, she said she doesn't miss home. Very few of them suffer from homesickness, and some of them, after arriving in this ancient China, immediately fell in love with it, so some are willing to stay here even after their discharge.

Learned Three Sentences of Chinese

Their dormitories are in the Moller Apartments on Lianer West Road. In addition, there is a swimming pool, library, and tennis court at the Racecourse. Every day after work, they like to stroll on the streets, read novels, or exercise. They all hope to have a Chinese friend, but due to the busyness of their work, there are too few opportunities, and most cannot fulfill their wishes, which everyone considers a great regret. Their impression of Shanghai women is: petite, bright, and delicate.

They all want to learn Chinese, and many have hired teachers to teach Mandarin. At the same time, in just a few months, they have all learned three sentences, and are using them repeatedly, which are—"Not good," "Don't understand," and "I am an American soldier." For example, when they go to a small shop to buy things, when they don't like the goods, they say, "Not good." If the shop assistant explains, they say, "Don't understand," and when they continue to be entangled, they will quickly blurt out the last sentence: "I am an American soldier!"

Curiosity: Mid-Autumn Festival Mooncakes

Their fixed salaries are mostly insufficient to cope with the current high cost of living. Miss Wu said, "This is a common phenomenon after the war. After serious damage, supply and demand cannot be balanced, so the cost of living rises, and limited income is not enough to cover expenses. This is inevitable." Fortunately, they have no burdens, so economics are not the most severe threat to them.

They are very interested in every inherent custom of China. Mid-Autumn Festival mooncakes, incense burners, and firecrackers have all attracted their curiosity. They unanimously said, "To understand China, you can't just look at the surface. Although firecrackers and gongs and drums are boring, if you are willing to observe in depth, every festival and every custom in China has its historical basis and value!"

### Under the Leadership of the "Flying Tiger General," the Air Transport Team Takes Off This Month

Chennault Hosted News Reporters Yesterday

Upholding the Spirit of Assisting China in the Past; Doing Our Best to Seek Benefits for the People

Headquarters Set Up in Guangzhou; Equipment Costs Paid by UNRRA

[Report from this Newspaper] "Flying Tiger General" Chennault (see photo) hosted reporters at the Leyi Hotel yesterday, and described the establishment of the "Chennault Air Transport Team." He first stated that from 1937 to 1945, he successively commanded the American Volunteer Group and the Fourteenth Air Force in China, assisting China in the War of Resistance. Today, he wants to help rebuild in the very land where he fought. The purpose of eight years of war was threefold: (1) to fight for freedom for the Chinese people; (2) to drive the Japanese army out of China; and (3) to maintain Chinese sovereignty. Fortunately, all three have been successful. However, in order to complete this task, we have also greatly damaged China's transportation. Therefore, today we want to uphold the spirit of assisting China in the past, to relieve the suffering of famine-stricken refugees in disaster areas, to remedy the losses suffered by industry during the war, to improve the lives of the Chinese people, and to help raise the education level of the Chinese people.

The Air Transport Team will be headquartered in Guangzhou. The cost of all equipment and other expenses is approximately US$2 million, paid by UNRRA. Its main task is to transport UNRRA relief supplies to areas designated by UNRRA. Some observers who do not understand the truth have mistakenly believed that Chen's move is an attempt to join the Chinese civil war, and that this Air Transport Team intends to compete with Chinese airlines. Chen solemnly declared that his purpose is to help the Chinese people, not to participate in the civil war. The main area of ​​activity of the Air Transport Team is limited to Central and Southern China. In these areas, he believes there is no civil war going on. As for the competition, it is an exaggeration, because the Air Transport Team is temporary in nature. When UNRRA ends, the Air Transport Team will also be dissolved. Given the current lack of air transport, even if the air transport equipment is five times what it is now, it would still not be enough to meet current needs.

In addition to the equipment worth US$2 million supplied by UNRRA, other miscellaneous expenses required for start-up will require US$1 million, mostly temporarily raised by people who previously participated in the American Volunteer Group and the Fourteenth Air Force. Flying personnel will also be mostly filled by them. The monthly salary of a formal airline pilot is US$800, and if the flying time is more than 80 hours, an additional US$5 per hour will be added. It is expected that flying will begin within three weeks, and it should be on track within three months. Chen estimated that the tonnage of the aircraft may only be enough to transport relief supplies, but if there is space left, it may carry returning passengers. The fare will be in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Communications, but due to the relationship with UNRRA, the freight for relief supplies will be specially discounted. Chen has been preparing to form this team for a long time. When reporters asked him why it was delayed until now, Chen replied that it was because the negotiations with various parties were quite tortuous, but said that if it had been established four months ago, it would have benefited many refugees greatly.

### Legal Adviser to the Ministry of Justice, Pound, Flies to the United States Today; Scheduled to Return to China in June Next Year for Long-Term Work

World-renowned legal authority and legal adviser to our nation's Ministry of Justice, Professor Pound, is scheduled to fly back to the United States from Shanghai with his wife this morning. They are scheduled to return to China for long-term work in June of next year. During his three months in China, Professor Pound worked very hard, conducting preliminary comprehensive research and criticism of China's legal system. He provided tens of thousands of words of advice, the main points of which are: (1) Since China has adopted the Continental legal system for more than 30 years, it should not make too many changes. (2) China's major legal codes are generally very complete, demonstrating that the drafters had a lot of research back then. (3) In the future, efforts should be made to promote legal education to enrich jurisprudence, and to compile systematic legal masterpieces, so that the interpretation and application of laws can be unified. (4) China's legal system is modeled after the West, and there are some places where it does not conform to national conditions. In the future, it should be adjusted to suit China's needs. (5) Any legal system has its historical and social background. The background of the Western legal system is different from that of China, and it may not be suitable to transplant it to China. National conditions should be considered and selected. (6) China has abundant talents. Chinese people should have self-confidence and not specialize in imitating other countries. (7) Some Chinese scholars have recently advocated abolishing the procuratorate system and replacing it with the British and American national lawyer system, and some have advocated adopting the jury system of Britain, the United States, and other countries. This is due to a lack of understanding of the actual situation of the legal systems of various countries and is not worth learning from. After returning to the United States, Professor Pound will conduct further research on the legal systems of various departments in our country in order to provide advice for our government's reference.

### Anonymous False Accusation Case Against a Colleague: Ouyang Huang Tried by the District Court Yesterday

[Report from this Newspaper] The District Court yesterday tried a false accusation case. Cai Boxiong and Ouyang Huang both operate import and export businesses. Cai opened Yusheng Firm, while Ouyang opened Meifeng Customs Brokerage. Due to competition in business, they became enemies. Ouyang was jealous and took advantage of the fact that the kidnapping case of Rong Desheng, the cotton yarn king, had not yet been solved, and anonymously sent a letter to the police局, accusing Cai Boxiong of being involved in the case and of having received a portion of the stolen money. After receiving the letter, the police局 went to Cai's address and arrested him, taking him back to the bureau. Cai vehemently denied the accusations. The police局 showed him the anonymous letter, and Cai recognized that the handwriting was similar to Ouyang Huang's. The police局 sent personnel disguised as businessmen to Meifeng Customs Brokerage and managed to obtain Ouyang's handwriting. After comparing it with the handwriting on the anonymous letter, they found that they were completely identical. They also found paper identical to that of the anonymous letter in his drawer, proving that Ouyang had made a false accusation. Ouyang Huang was prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office according to the law. The trial was opened in the District Court yesterday. Cai Boxiong hired lawyer Yu Enliang to appear in court. In addition to requesting that the court punish the defendant for the crime he deserved, he also filed a civil suit, requesting that the court order the defendant to publish the full text of the judgment in the newspaper to restore his reputation. The court adjourned the trial.

### American Feng Bank Employee Injured in Car Accident on Way Home

[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Zhixiong, a senior employee of the Sichuan Meifeng Bank, finished his work late at night and took a private car to return to his residence at No. 842 Cihui Lane, Qimen Road. When passing Lantian Road on Fuxing Middle Road, a school bus from Shanghai University suddenly stopped in the middle of the road. He braked sharply to avoid it, but unexpectedly, a Qing-Shanghai long-distance bus came speeding up from behind, causing a violent collision and knocking the car and its occupant to the ground. Li was seriously injured internally. A police officer arrived, recorded the license plate number of the vehicle responsible for the accident, and sent Li to Guangci Hospital for treatment.

Yesterday afternoon, a local woman named Wang Juan'di, 19 years old, was returning home from a relative's house. When walking near the Shijiazhai area of Bridge No. 4 on the Shanghai-Min Road, a truck of unknown number suddenly sped from west to east. Wang tried to avoid it but was hit and knocked to the ground, her right foot crushed. She lost consciousness. The driver, seeing no one around, sped away.

At 0:30 yesterday afternoon, a pedestrian named Feng A'wu (resident of No. 14, Lane 309, Wuchang Road) was run over by a jeep with the license plate number 14289 at the intersection of Sichuan North Road and Wuchang Road. He was subsequently sent to a hospital.

### Seeing His Wife's Lover, Husband Planned Murder Using Hammer, Knife, and Any Means Necessary, Senior Clerk Narrowly Escapes Death at Night

[Report from Our Newspaper] Qin Mingying, a 29-year-old woman from Nanjing, lived in the east back room of No. 1, Hong'an Lane, Guanyi East Lane, Nanshi. She was known to be fierce and unreasonable. After her husband died, she lived with a lover for a while, then divorced. In May of this year, Qin was introduced to Wang Lisheng, a Shanghai native who worked as a senior clerk at the Santai Printing Factory on Maigen Road. They cohabitated in Nanshi. After only four months, Qin grew displeased with Wang's low income, often quarreled with him, and grew to loathe him, plotting to find a new lover.

On the 15th of this month, Wang returned home from work and caught a glimpse of a 30-year-old man in a Western suit lying on his bed. When questioned, Qin tried to cover it up, claiming he was a friend of her late husband. Wang had no evidence and could do nothing. He was already angry about other matters, and so left the house in a fit of rage. Qin did not ask the man to leave. Instead, she prepared a feast for him and invited Lu Suzhen from No. 6 of the lane to join them for dinner. By the time Wang returned home late at night, they had all left. That evening, Qin seemed unhappy and used it as an excuse to demand money from Wang, who handed over all the cash he had, over ten thousand yuan. Afterward, Qin handed Wang a kitchen knife and told him to sharpen it. Wang, wanting to please Qin, took the knife and sharpened it until it was bright and sharp. Nothing happened that night. The next day (the 16th), Wang returned home at 6:00 PM, an hour later than usual. Qin started an argument again. That night, as Wang slept soundly around 10:00 PM, Qin suddenly got up and kicked Wang hard in the waist. Wang woke up in excruciating pain, spitting blood because the kick hit a vital spot. Wang struggled to get up, enduring the pain. Qin threw a glass at his head, causing him to faint and severely injuring his cheek. Qin, afraid he would resist, then struck his spine with a hammer. Wang, in unbearable pain, screamed for help. Qin, hearing his shouts and fearing she would alarm the neighbors, decided to finish the job. She grabbed the incredibly sharp kitchen knife that she had ordered Wang to sharpen the previous night, and wildly attacked him. Wang, slightly regaining consciousness, used his arms to defend himself and was cut. By this time, neighbors had heard the screams and rushed into the east wing, finding Wang covered in injuries, and Qin still attempting to attack him. They restrained her, turned her over to the police, and took her to the Nanshi Yimiao Branch for interrogation. Wang was sent to the hospital for treatment.

### Five Hundred Ambitious Youths Prepare to Organize a Fellowship Association

They braved the dangers, broke through enemy lines, and safely arrived in the interior in batches. After the victory against Japan, most of them completed their studies and returned to Shanghai. To commemorate the martyred soldiers, encourage their past integrity, and motivate future endeavors, they are preparing to organize a fellowship association for the five hundred ambitious youths. Work has already begun actively. The preparatory office is temporarily located within the Shanghai Branch of the Youth Corps at No. 114, Zhongzheng South Second Road.

### Wang Zhengting, Returned from the Philippines, Discusses the Life of Overseas Chinese, from the Municipal Council to the People and Affairs of the Nation

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] In the quiet, I suddenly heard a series of light footsteps on the stairs. Then, Mr. Wang Zhengting walked into the living room. Mr. Wang's hair was almost completely white, which surprised me.

Development of Overseas Chinese Affairs

Mr. Wang said, "When I went to the Philippines, President Roxas had already taken office. Now, the Philippines is generally stable, although there are some minor disturbances in some areas, but they are not very important. The general life of the overseas Chinese is still good, but the new Philippine government has decided on a new restriction for the various enterprises of the overseas Chinese in the Philippines. That is, the salaries of Filipino employees must account for at least six-tenths of the total salaries of the entire company. This may cause considerable inconvenience to the overseas Chinese. Because the restriction on salaries is different from the restriction on the number of employees. The salary of a person with a higher position may exceed the salaries of ten low-level employees, and good talents are still quite lacking among the Filipinos. Because they are restricted by the salary ratio, the overseas Chinese have to hire more Filipinos and raise their positions accordingly. Since there are few talents in the Philippines, the progress of business feels difficult."

I asked, "When the United States recognized the independence of the Philippines, did it still retain some commercial or other preferential rights?"

Mr. Wang said, "Of course, the relationship between the United States and the Philippines has been so close in the past, and the feelings are naturally different from those of other countries. But when the United States recognized the independence of the Philippines, what the United States asked for was only that the Philippines lease some naval and air force bases to the United States for use. As for which locations to lease, it will be decided through negotiations between the two countries."

Sino-Philippine Trade

Next, Mr. Wang talked about the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines. If there are commercial disputes among the overseas Chinese, they are often mediated by the Chamber of Commerce. An American newspaper once criticized this, saying that the Chinese Chamber of Commerce undermined the sovereignty of the Philippines. Mr. Wang said that this was completely a misunderstanding, because the meaning of this kind of mediation is actually only equivalent to "having tea and talking," and the main purpose is to avoid lawsuits due to minor disputes. There is no question of infringing on the sovereignty of the Philippines.

When talking about promoting Sino-Philippine trade, Mr. Wang said that what the Philippines needs most is cloth. The need for tea and silk is very small, but our own cloth is still in short supply.

Concern for Politics

Because Mr. Wang is a city councilor, I asked him for his opinion on the council. He said, "I think it is a good phenomenon that the people are so concerned about politics. But I really think it is unlikely that the efficiency of the municipal government will reach the level of the former Public Works Department in the future."

He lightly brushed the ash from his cigar, and said enthusiastically, "I often say that Chinese people lack three things the most. First, we lack organizational ability. The country with the strongest organizational ability in the world should be Germany, followed by the United Kingdom and the United States. France is far behind, and China is completely out of the question. Just look at how many overlapping government agencies there are? Not only is it slow and procrastinating to do things, but there are also many restrictions. This kind of organizational ability should be cultivated through learning. As long as you are willing to learn, you are not afraid of not learning.

A Kind of Power

"Second, we lack a kind of mutually coordinated power. Chinese people have always managed their businesses independently. Since ancient times, the concept of 'family' has had a very influential role among us. People working in the Shanxi pawnshops were mostly family members, fathers and sons, relatives and old friends. If you want to unite several pawnshops to organize a joint-stock company, it is unlikely to succeed in eight or nine out of ten cases. Take the takeover after this victory as an example. We have suffered from the inability to coordinate, so each agency took over independently. The types of seals were diverse, and the results were very disappointing. In fact, all enemy and puppet property in Shanghai should be entrusted to the Shanghai Municipal Government for takeover, and there should only be one type of seal from the Shanghai Municipal Government. After this unified takeover, it can then be processed, so it will not be chaotic.

"The most important thing is the third point. The cooperation spirit of Chinese people is too poor. In other countries, when someone responsible for doing things succeeds, everyone often thinks that this is part of the success of the entire country, so everyone tries their best to encourage him and help him succeed. It's not the case in China. When a person is about to succeed, others will think, why should success belong to him alone and not to me? As a result, they exert all their efforts to exclude and sabotage, and everyone cannot do things. We must use the power of education to overcome these three shortcomings one by one, otherwise Chinese affairs will never be done well."

Eloquent

Mr. Wang's eloquence reminded me of his posture when he was negotiating internationally for many years.

He said, "My view on national affairs is this: a minority must obey the majority, otherwise there is no talk of democracy. However, this minority should still have the right to criticize this majority. If the opinions of this majority are wrong, after this kind of criticism, the original majority may become a minority, and obey the new majority. This is the true spirit of democracy."

Mr. Wang is a very busy person. He has only recently returned to China from the Philippines, but he may leave Shanghai for another place soon.

### Ministry of Education to Convene University Presidents in the Capital to Discuss Examinations for Returning Students; Students from Six Universities, Including Chongqing University, Cannot Be Exempted

[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing] Wang Quan, Zhu Songlin, and other representatives of returning students from six universities in the rear, including Yunnan University, Sichuan University, Chongqing University, Guizhou University, Guiyang Normal College, and Medical College, petitioned the Ministry of Education on the 16th regarding their request for assistance in transferring to schools in their hometowns. Details were published in this newspaper. It has been learned that the Ministry of Education has scheduled a meeting with university presidents in the capital this Friday to discuss how to hold examinations and provide assistance to students transferring back to their hometowns. It is said that the Ministry of Education is very concerned about and wants to assist students from the rear in transferring back to their hometowns. However, it is hoped that the returning students will take the exams in time. As for the request from students from six universities, including Chongqing University, to be exempted from the exams based on their original school grades, it is unlikely to be granted.

### Regulations for Returning to School for Students of National Middle Schools

[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing] The Ministry of Education has formulated regulations for students of national middle schools in the rear to return to school and has ordered various departments and bureaus to implement them. Many students and their parents are not familiar with the content of the regulations, and some who have transferred to other regions do not know whether public funding can be continued. Many have sent letters to the Ministry of Education and various departments and bureaus to inquire. According to an investigation from the Ministry of Education and inquiries to the relevant department and section, supplemented with opinions, the main points of the regulations for students of national middle schools to return to school are extracted below: (1) Students of national middle schools in the rear who return to their original hometowns should report to the Education Department and Bureau of their hometown with a transfer certificate issued by the school in the rear and wait for assignment to schools. (2) If parents are in other provinces and cities, and students do not return to their hometown but want to enroll in the place where their parents are located, they must obtain a certificate from the organization where their parents work and apply to the school for a transfer to another region. After approval, they do not have to return to their hometown and can study with their parents. (3) Those who originally had public funding will continue to receive public funding. (4) Returning students and students transferring to other regions must register for admission or transfer to another region with their academic record cards. (5) The Ministry of Education has distributed the academic record cards to the Education Departments and Bureaus of various provinces and cities, and has also allocated (1) student public funding, (2) teacher salaries, (3) class fees (if there are 25 students, the funding for one class will be allocated; if there are only 20 students, half of the class funding will be allocated), (4) construction fees to the Education Departments and Bureaus of various provinces and cities from August onward for the use of these departments and bureaus to handle the restoration of these students. (6) The Ministry of Education established national middle schools to provide relief to displaced youth during the war. Now that victory has been achieved and they are returning to their hometowns, the students of national middle schools will be transferred to local management, and considerable funding will be provided at the same time. From now on, the Ministry will not directly run middle schools, nor will it distribute students anymore.

Civil Affairs Briefs

### National Identity Cards Should Be Applied for According to Law; Civil Affairs Bureau Dispatches Letters to Each District for Implementation

In order to understand the situation of citizens obtaining national identity cards, the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government has specifically stipulated that during this household re-registration, residents should be checked to see if they have applied for identity cards.

### Matters Needing Attention When Filling Out the Household Re-Registration Form Before Registration (Continued)

4.  Age and Date of Birth: The age filled in the household register is the "actual age" of the person at the time of filling out the form. The calculation of "actual age" should be based on the "date of birth." (In the past, calculations were based on ordinary age, which easily led to errors, so in the future, calculations must be based on the date of birth). Therefore, when filling out the form, the date of birth can be filled in first, followed by the age. However, it is not easy for most people to answer what year they were born. A table is attached to find the year of birth from "ordinary age" or "zodiac sign."

Age Conversion Table (For the 35th Year of the Republic)

For example, if the ordinary age is 35 years old, then the year of birth is the 1st year of the Republic. If the ordinary age is 67 years old, then the year of birth is the 32nd year before the Republic. Or, if a person's zodiac sign is Ox and is in their forties or fifties, then the table shows that those with the zodiac sign of Ox in their forties have an ordinary age of 46 years old, meaning they were born in the 11th year before the Republic.

If only the lunar month and day of birth are remembered, they should be filled in with the lunar calendar. If the month and day of birth are completely forgotten, then they should be estimated as July 1. If the month of birth is known, but the day of birth is not, then it should be estimated as the 15th of that month.

After filling in the date of birth, the actual age can be calculated based on the date of birth. Another table is attached to convert the "date of birth" into actual age.

### Regarding the Matter of Paying Deposits a Thousandfold: Opinion of the President of the Judicial Yuan; Matter is of Great Importance and Is Being Closely Discussed with the Ministry of Finance

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, this reporter visited Ju Zheng, the President of the Judicial Yuan, to inquire about his opinion on the court ruling that pre-war bank deposits should be repaid a thousandfold. President Ju replied that, in terms of price index, a thousandfold is not excessive. This is because the price of rice and cloth has increased by more than five thousand or even ten thousand times compared to pre-war levels. However, 20 percent of the commercial bank's reserves are deposited in the national treasury and cannot be used. This point of loss should also be taken into account. Currently, the Shanghai Four Banks Savings Association has filed an appeal against the ruling. It would not be right for the court to reject it. This matter is of great importance and involves many problems. If it is not resolved, then the settlement of pre-war debts and the withdrawal of long-term savings upon maturity will inevitably lead to many disputes. I previously discussed this matter with Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance, and we are currently discussing solutions.

### Dividing the Nation into Nine Economic Zones

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The central design organization is following the instructions of the authorities to design the division of the country into nine economic units. This work began before the end of the Anti-Japanese War. The general outline of the nine economic regions, it is said, was determined by the highest authority and developed with the input of Weng Wenhao. In the future, the construction of each region will have its own central objectives based on the distribution of its natural resources. Furthermore, because this design work has national defense confidentiality, it will not be made public after completion.

### Gold Notes Stable

Yesterday, the exchange rate remained calm. The morning opened at 2,147,000 with sellers offering. After the opening, the rate was immediately surrounded by sellers at 2,148,000, gradually declining slightly. However, there was much struggle around 2,140,000. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank distributed 50 bars at a price of 2,135,000. After that, it briefly decreased to 2,132,000 and then stabilized slightly. At noon, it was around 2,135,000. In the afternoon, it first retreated to 2,130,000. Next-day settlement still rose to around 2,140,000. As a result, there was no change compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments, silver ingots, and silver dollars were all flat. The secret interest rate retreated to around 1.3 jiao due to the easing of money supply.

Foreign currencies continued to be mediocre. However, the Hong Kong dollar increased slightly. The US dollar opened in the morning at 3380 yuan with sellers offering. There were no changes along the way. Later, due to the slight decline in the gold market, it retreated to 3160 yuan at noon and then stabilized slightly. In the afternoon, it rose slightly. As a result, it rose by 5 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong banknotes were stable after the initial flat opening and also rose by 3 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was stable after the initial flat opening. The Hong Kong telegraphic transfer narrowed slightly and rose to 695 yuan to 705 yuan. The Indian exchange rate also improved and was offered at 845 yuan. The British exchange rate rose slightly to 11,400 yuan with supplies available. The US exchange rate remained at the posted price.

### Government Bonds Declined Slightly

Trading in government bonds was still brisk, reaching more than 7 million yuan in par value. Most buyers were still retail investors. Occasionally, there were institutional buyers, which was relatively stable. The A-B-C bond opened in the morning at 2100 yuan. After the opening, it fell to 2050 yuan, and then buyers became active. The market improved to 2180 yuan midway before turning back. Before closing, it retreated to below 2100 yuan again. As a result, it declined slightly by 50 yuan compared to the previous close. Bonds A, B, and E were flat, and Bond D fell sharply by 100 yuan.

### Foreign Stocks Continue to Decline, Situation Forms a One-Sided Fall

Foreign stocks continue to be sold off, and new buyers are nowhere to be seen. The situation is trending downward in a one-sided manner. Except for paper stocks Xiangtai, which are still stable, the others are difficult to rally. As a result, compared to the previous close, Jardine Matheson Textiles and British-American Tobacco fell by half a percent, steel stocks fell by 10 percent, and Wing On, Asia, and Wheelock Marden fell slightly, although they fell. Paper stocks were flat.

### Standardizing the Purchase Price of Autumn Cocoons: Not Lower Than 200,000 Yuan

The purchase price of autumn cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has been repeatedly discussed by the China Silk Corporation, the authorities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and the silk industry associations of the three regions. In order to encourage silk farmers to produce and increase the purchase price of fresh cocoons, it was decided to use the price of three dan of rice to convert into the price of one dan of fresh cocoons. However, because the price of rice varies from place to place, in order to unify the purchase price, consultations were held several times. Finally, it was decided to unify the purchase price, which was submitted to the authorities for approval. It is now learned that the unified price has been approved by the authorities, and the price of each dan of fresh cocoons should not be lower than 120,000 yuan. Now that the cocoon markets in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are about to open, the purchase price must comply with the approved unified price and should not be lowered to ease the burden on silk farmers.

### Rayon Surpasses 3 Million Yuan: General Silk Manufacturers Are Panic-Stricken

The momentum of rayon has been surging for days, and the black market is in high spirits. There is an endless stream of buyers. Yesterday, it surged past the 3 million yuan mark again. No. 120 Tianqiao Youguang opened in the morning at 3,050,000 yuan, which was 890,000 yuan higher than the previous day. In the morning, the lowest was 20,000 yuan, and the highest was 80,000 yuan. Later, it closed at 3,060,000 yuan. In the afternoon, holders blindly raised prices, and transactions were made at 60,000 and 80,000 yuan. In the end, someone wanted 100,000 yuan, and the seller shouted 200,000 yuan, which was 145,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Miscellaneous brands of No. 120 Youguang were 111,200 yuan higher. Semi-gloss was traded at 2.7 million yuan in the morning, and the afternoon saw prices of 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. Factory managers have been affected by rayon, and transactions with user silk have been quite frequent. The market is strong and resilient, but no one is interested in high uniformity, making it difficult to see a good market price. Silk goods have generally increased by about 10 percent, but transactions have not yet begun. In general, silk manufacturers are in a state of anxiety all day, not knowing what to do. Because the price of raw materials is soaring, the price of silk goods is really hard to catch up with.

### Sugar Stocks Are Quite Abundant

[Report from Our Newspaper] The city's sugar is in a state of panic. It is not easy for various South Goods businesses to allocate supplies. However, according to shipping news, the city's sugar stocks are extremely abundant. The second wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, i.e., Zhongzhan, and the fifth wharf, i.e., Pudong Yangjiadu, have no less than 300,000 bags of sugar in stock, which have been piled up for several months without being withdrawn. As a result, yesterday, the Haiyu vessel came to Shanghai from Keelung and loaded a large batch of Taiwan sugar, but there was no way to store it.

### Limited Outlets for Timber

The timber market has not improved since the Mid-Autumn Festival. Because of the continued arrival of foreign pine, outlets are limited, and the market price is hovering around the cost line. Due to the surge in the arrival of fir, sellers are reluctantly suffering losses. Therefore, the future of the general timber market is difficult to be optimistic about.

### Artificial Cotton Invented by a Chinese

Can Start Work Around Double Ten Day

### Banks Freeze Foreign Exchange; Central Bank to Purchase Starting Next Month

After that, foreign banks will not be able to open foreign currency accounts in order to prevent the private settlement of foreign exchange with US dollars.

### US Pacific Route Avoids China and Japan; Shifts to Southeast Asia

[Reuters, New York, 16th] According to reports heard from the Maritime Commission, the interest of the US Pacific routes seems to be shifting from Japan and China to Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. This tendency is due to the desire to expand shipping in the South Pacific and the uncertainty about trade with Japan and China. Currently, there are ten US shipping companies that want to establish new routes or restore old routes in that area, compared to only three before the war.

### New Xianzhong Second Continues to Fall; Coarse Grains Show No Improvement

West Road early-color japonica is entering the market, while medium-color and late-color still need time. Baiyuan and Xin Yinyuan are bitterly without inquiries, continuing to fall sharply, down another 3,500 yuan. Flour still tends to be strong. Wheat from Fujian and Ningbo slightly improved, rising 5-600 yuan. Soybeans from Shantou were cleared. The market here was not strong, still more supply than demand, with prices falling 5-600 to 1,000 yuan. Medium and low grades still lacked transactions. Broad beans were in a stagnant situation. High-quality raw peanuts were fixed, and medium grades continued to decline by 1-2,000 yuan. The red sorghum market softened. Corn was still. Cowpeas fell by 1,000 yuan following the trend. The oil market showed hopeful signs. Goods from Qingdao and Dalian arrived slightly. Factory supplies were still connected. Various oils fell by 2-3,000 yuan. Soybean cake had few transactions in various ports and rural areas, falling another 3-400 yuan.

### Is Increased Payment of Pre-War Deposits Appropriate? (Part 1)

— Xie Tingxin

The matter of repaying pre-war deposits with increased multiples has attracted close attention from the economic and social sectors due to the Shanghai Branch of the Four Banks Savings Association case, in which the Shanghai Local Court ordered a payment of 1,000 times. Disputes over private debts and claims will also emerge endlessly as a result. The basis for the court's ruling this time is Article 12 of the "Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Reconstruction," promulgated on December 18, 1945, and the Judicial Yuan's Interpretation No. 3018, which states that the provisions for increasing or decreasing payments are universally applicable. Since there is no express exception regarding payments by banks, they should naturally be applied. These are all rulings that favor depositors, and it seems that sufficient consideration has not been given to whether the rulings are fair to banks. Therefore, I will state my views in two aspects.

In terms of legal principles:

1.  Conflicts with the Savings Bank Law: The only reason for the ruling in the judgment that the bank should pay 1,000 times is that "after receiving savings deposits, the defendant actually used part of the deposits as working capital, and the remaining deposits were used to purchase government bonds and other bonds as collateral, or invested in real estate to stabilize the assets. They must have used the funds received for multifaceted activities and utilization. Even though government bonds suffered considerable losses due to the Ministry of Finance's method of repaying the principal at par value, the value of currency in other investments has greatly increased. They should naturally be required to increase the payment a thousandfold to maintain fairness." The defendant is the Four Banks Savings Association. The Savings Association's use of funds must be carried out in accordance with the "Savings Bank Law" passed by the Legislative Yuan on June 22, 1934, and promulgated by the National Government on July 4 of the same year. Article 7 of the Savings Bank Law has the following provisions regarding the use of funds by savings banks:

Savings banks may not use their funds except in accordance with the following methods:

(1) Purchase of government bonds, treasury bills, and other valuable securities recognized by the Ministry of Finance with reliable collateral.

(2) Loans secured by government bonds, treasury bills, and other valuable securities recognized by the Ministry of Finance with reliable collateral.

(3) Loans secured by real estate with continuous and reliable income as collateral.

(4) Loans secured by time deposit certificates or passbooks of other banks as collateral.

(5) Purchase of bills accepted by other banks.

(6) Deposits in other banks.

(7) Collateral loans to rural cooperatives.

(8) Loans secured by agricultural products as collateral.

It can be seen that most of the methods used by savings banks to use funds are lending and purchasing government bonds, and they can never invest in real estate. Otherwise, it would be illegal. The phrase "or invest in real estate" mentioned in the judgment is a conjecture and has no basis. Savings banks have minimum requirements for loans under items 7 and 8, and there are quality and quantity restrictions for valuable securities other than government bonds. Therefore, it can be said that the vast majority of savings banks' funds are used for lending and government bonds. Both of these investments depreciate with the devaluation of the currency, making it difficult to achieve the ideal of "greatly increasing the value of currency" mentioned in the judgment. In fact, banks may not have fully operated in accordance with the Savings Bank Law, but since the law has been implemented, the judiciary cannot deny it. Furthermore, it cannot arbitrarily list "investment in real estate" as one of the ways for savings banks to use funds. The judicial authorities did not send personnel to audit accounts and made arbitrary judgments without legal basis. This is one of the things overlooked in the judgment. (To be continued)

### Chinese Stocks Fall Across the Board; Selling Pressure in the Market Is High

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday was the second day of stock auctions at the Securities Exchange. As a result of the trading, the stocks continued the previous day's trend, all falling. However, there was progress in the collective reconciliation of accounts at 5:00 PM, and the accounts were balanced by 6:22 PM. Yesterday, the Securities Exchange also issued two public notices in the stock market. Notice No. 17 stated that the trading unit for Meiya Silk Factory's stock has been changed to 500 shares starting on September 10. The 100-share stock can still be delivered as usual. The general situation of yesterday's trading is described as follows:

When the stock market opened yesterday, the market price of the Gu stocks was almost the same as the closing market price of yesterday. The brokers in the market were very enthusiastic in bidding after the opening. The market in the market was quite stable within half an hour. After 10:30, the atmosphere in the market turned active, and the trading was extremely strong. The market prices of Yong'an Yarn Factory, Qinxing Socks and Shirts, Xinguang Underwear, and Meiya Silk Weaving all tended to flourish. Yong'an Yarn Factory once rose to 658 yuan, Meiya rose to 4,220 yuan, and Qinxing rose to 239 yuan. Then they showed a slight fatigue again. After 11:00, the market situation became quieter, and the trading decreased, and the market price went downstream. After 11:30. The decline was greater, Yong'an Yarn Factory fell to 628 yuan, Dongxing Socks and Shirts fell to 224 yuan, and the decline of Meiya was even more severe, with some transactions at 4,030 yuan. The market price only recovered slightly when the market closed at 12:00 noon. Looking at the market situation today, it is similar to yesterday, and the market prices of all stocks have fallen slightly, but the decline is not large. The difference between the highest and lowest prices is only about 5% on average. The total transaction volume was 4,920,900 shares, of which Yong'an Yarn Factory had a transaction volume of more than 1.5 million shares, Dongxing had a transaction volume of 540,000 shares, Huafeng had a transaction volume of 470,000 shares, Liangfu had a transaction volume of 465,000 shares, and Meiya had a transaction volume of 180,000 shares, all of which were more than the transaction volume yesterday.

Also, Huagu continued to fall sharply in the securities industry. Some medium-sized stocks in the cold stocks suddenly lacked maintenance and began to fall miserably. On the contrary, small stocks such as Lian'an Department Store and Huafeng Enamelware were still active and remained unmoved. When the stocks fell to below the previous closing price, the short sellers made up their positions at one time, and those who made profits also took advantage of the opportunity. The Guang Gang slightly improved, but suddenly there was a counter-trend in the middle, and the hot stocks once rose above the opening price before the buying stopped. Then the trend of selling became popular again, and the Bei Gang also sold. Yongsha first fell back, affecting other stocks. The most fatigued among them were Dachina Match, Wing On Company, and the decline was the largest. Rongfeng, Huafeng, and Lian'an were very stable, and they showed upward gestures from time to time. Before closing, the overall situation was unfavorable, and the high prices also came back. As a result, the previous closings of Yongsha, Meiya, Jingfu, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Zhongfang each fell by less than half a percent. Tongyi, Wuhe, and Cement Datong had a slight decline. The silk industry Xinhuo Underwear fell by more than half a percent, and the company Xinya fell by 10%. Match fell by 15%, which was the largest decline. Jinglun Rongfeng was flat. Lian'an Huafeng continued to rise. The various stocks outside the market also showed small gains.

### After the Fujian-Guangdong Ban on Transport, the Yarn Market Is Still Firm; Textile and Construction Warehouse Receipts Are Welcomed on Time; 37 Kinds of Cotton Cloth Prices Are Unchanged

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the yarn market was as stable as a rock. Although there were no sales in South China, the Bei Gang had a good appetite. Medium-sized yarns such as Hong Kuixing and Tiannv were sold a lot. Customers along the Yangtze River also absorbed shares, so the yarn market was very firm, and it did not weaken slightly due to the ban on transport in Fujian and Guangdong. The trading of textile and construction futures warehouse receipts was very lively among peers, because the warehouse receipts of the company arrived on the date of delivery without any mistake, which is unlike the distribution warehouse receipts of private factories, which have arbitrary delays.

Also, it is reported that yesterday morning, the Bei Gang absorbed 20 counts of yarn and loaded them to Guanwai. According to Bei Gang merchants, loading to Guanwai at today's closing price has a considerable surplus. Therefore, the people's minds were excited for a while, but in the end, because the appetite was not strong enough, it tended downstream again. At the close near noon, the price was slightly lower than the previous day, with 42 counts of Blue Phoenix at 2.16 million to 2.2 million yuan, and 20 counts of Blue Phoenix at around 1.4 million yuan.

Yesterday, Fangjian opened a total of 37 kinds of white print drills and blue V-shaped fine cloth. The prices were still according to the original board. Many numbers applied for drills, but few were approved. After the purchase orders were issued at 4:30 PM, it was learned that the market price of old drills was still shouting 66,000 yuan, but no one was willing to sell. Blue V-shaped was shouting 62,500 yuan, and colorless ball was shouting 58,800 yuan. Dyeing factories needed the leading high-end gray cloth, but Fangjian did not open it yesterday, resulting in no market.

### Behavior Tax Mixed into Commodity Tax: Dried Meat Also Taxed with Slaughter Tax; Only Increase Revenue, Disregarding Legal Principles

[Our Newspaper News] The City Chamber of Commerce, based on a letter from the city's Ham and Cured Meat Trade Associations, requested the abolition of the dried meat slaughter tax. A special submission was made to the Nanjing Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai Municipal Government. The original letter stated: "The slaughter tax is levied at a statutory rate on the act of slaughtering and selling. According to the Business Tax Law of the 20th year of the Republic of China, it was originally classified as a type of business tax. Although the slaughter tax was separated from the business tax in the two revisions of the Business Tax Law in the 32nd and 35th years, the slaughter tax is levied because of the act of slaughtering and selling. Therefore, it is undeniable that this tax is a behavior tax. A behavior tax is a tax on people, a type of direct tax, which is absolutely different in nature from a tax on goods, which is an indirect tax that can be passed on at any time and place. Article 4, Paragraph 1 of the Shanghai Slaughter Tax Collection Rules stipulates that 'Fresh and dried meat transported in from outside the urban area, unless they hold a certificate from the original slaughter site's collection agency proving that the slaughter tax has been paid, shall be exempted from taxation after verification.' This provision arbitrarily changes the behavior tax into a commodity tax, treating it the same as a commodity tax that requires tax payment certificates for verification and release. This fundamentally violates the principles of tax law and is a fundamental error. In recent years, local governments have promulgated regulations for collecting taxes, aiming only to expand the scope and increase revenue, often failing to consider the basic principles of tax law. As a result, taxpayers are at a loss, and their appeals often go unanswered for years. The matter is truly lamentable. In light of the above, we earnestly submit this telegram, hoping that your Ministry (Government) will review and approve it. Considering the name of the dried meat slaughter tax, based on the principle that the slaughter tax is a behavior tax, there is no room for it to exist. We request immediate verification and abolition, as it is in the public interest."

### Qingdao Cotton Yarn Arrives in Shanghai

[Our Newspaper News] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiwan vessel arrived in port yesterday from Qingdao, carrying over 71,000 pieces of goods such as fruits, including over 500 pieces of cotton yarn and over 800 pieces of tobacco leaves. The shipment of Qingdao cotton yarn to Shanghai is a first.

### British Trade Delegation to Fly to Shanghai from India on the 23rd

The British trade delegation is visiting various places in the Far East for inspection. They are currently inspecting the cotton textile industry in places such as Calcutta and Mumbai. They are scheduled to fly to Shanghai from India on the 23rd of this month. Zhang Ziyue, the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Shanghai, has joined relevant agencies and commercial organizations to prepare for a welcome.

### Fake Central Reserve Bank Deposits: Periodic Continued Return

The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance's Liquidation of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank has been returning deposits from the enemy-puppet period in accordance with regulations. To date, some depositors have not yet claimed their funds. In consideration of the people's rights and interests, the office has drafted further refund measures for approval by the head office. It is scheduled to resume refunds starting on October 1st, for a period of two months. The scope of liquidation responsibility of the office includes the Shanghai Branch of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank, the Suzhou Sub-branch, and eight offices in Huxi, Hunan, Nantong, Songjiang, Taicang, Kunshan, and Wuxi. In addition to public announcements in the city, the office will also forward announcements to the county governments to inform depositors in other counties. If depositors do not claim their funds by the deadline, the office will compile the cases and hand them over to the national treasury.

### New Quanzhou Pao Yuan (Longan) Opens

The first batch of new Quanzhou Pao Yuan (longan) opened in the market yesterday. The higher prices were 280,000 yuan, with slightly lower prices for the next best. It is about 10% smaller than the first batch of Tong'an goods. As sales are not yet brisk, the market is average.

### High Cost of New Tea Makes Export Difficult; Stagnant Sales of Aged Tea Also Obstructed; Japan Ships Large Quantities of New Tea to America for Competitive Sales

[Our Newspaper News] Our country's uncolored green tea has been sold to the United States in large quantities over the years. According to General Manager Li of Wuchang Tea Company, who spoke to reporters, the demand for tea is quite strong at present, but the price of our country's new tea is too high to promote sales. Although aged goods are closer in price, a large batch of Japanese new green tea has recently been competing for sales, reaching as much as five million pounds. It is said to be divided into three batches. The first batch of 1.5 million pounds has already been shipped, the second batch of 1.5 million pounds is also about to be shipped, and the third batch of 2 million pounds is scheduled to be shipped in early October. Based on the current situation, the promotion of our country's aged tea to the United States will once again be in a difficult situation.

[Reuters, New York, 16th] The second batch of Japanese tea, totaling 1,500,000 pounds, is expected to arrive here in early October. The first batch of the same quantity was recently imported by an American trading company dealing in Japanese silk. The total amount of Japanese tea shipped to the United States in the next four months is expected to reach 5,000,000 pounds.

### The 15th Anniversary of the September 18th Incident: Old Scars Reopened, New Sighs Never Cease

— From Our Newspaper Archives

Fifteen years ago today, the brutal Japanese army invaded our Northeast, causing the world-shocking September 18th Incident, leaving a permanent stain on human history. Fifteen years later today, more than a year after Japan's defeat, the Northeast is still full of scars. Looking back on the past and contemplating the present, there are countless sighs and infinite pain!

Speaking of the Japanese invasion of China, it was originally planned in the "Continental Policy." The famous "Tanaka Memorial" had already spread the fallacy that "to conquer the world, one must first conquer China; to conquer China, one must first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia." In addition, the world economy experienced a panic in 1929, and Japan's foreign trade decreased sharply. In 1931, the number of unemployed people in Japan suddenly increased, and workers and farmers were restless. In order to alleviate the domestic revolutionary crisis and divert people's attention, the rulers and the bourgeoisie had to seek a way out abroad, and the Northeast bore the brunt. In addition, the international situation at that time was complex, with Western countries mostly preoccupied with their own affairs, and China was newly unified and not yet fully stable. The enemy believed that a good opportunity was rare, so they blatantly disregarded everything and launched a war of aggression against China.

The Eve of the Incident

Japan deliberately created the September 18th Incident, so the preparations were exceptionally meticulous. Relying on unequal treaties, the Japanese army had already obtained the right to station troops in southern Manchuria. On the eve of the incident, the Japanese troops transferred to the three northeastern provinces already numbered more than 20,000, plus more than 7,000 "reservists," 5,000 to 6,000 police officers, and several thousand "bandits" and "Mongol bandits" directly under the command of the Japanese army. Along the Anfeng Railway, the Japanese army had built about 80 artillery forts. As for the political aspect, in 1930, the Wakatsuki Cabinet colluded with financial capitalists. Under their instigation, they vigorously expanded militarism and appointed Yugaki Kazushige, an active advocate of invading China, as Governor-General of Korea, Uchida Kosai as President of the South Manchuria Railway, and Minami Jiro as Minister of the Army. From then on, the Japanese warlords raised their heads and acted more recklessly.

The Japanese invaders were even more meticulous, fearing that once they used force to invade China, it would provoke a joint resistance from the Chinese and Korean nations. Therefore, in July 1931, the Japanese consul in Changchun instigated Korean farmers to dig canals and divert water in Wanbaoshan, destroying tens of thousands of acres of farmland belonging to our people. Our local farmers protested and clashed with the Japanese police, resulting in many deaths and injuries. The Japanese further spread propaganda to the Koreans, distorting right and wrong and falsely accusing China of oppressing Korean farmers. As a result, riots broke out in Seoul, Incheon, Pyongyang and other places in Korea, and overseas Chinese were massacred. The Chinese government protested, and Japan made various excuses. A few days later, Japan used the disappearance of Captain Nakamura in the Hinggan Mountains as an excuse, falsely claiming that he was killed by our garrison troops. With the preparations in place, they launched an attack on Shenyang on the night of September 18.

The Scene of the Incident

The Japanese army destroyed the Liutiao Lake railway bridge on the South Manchuria Railway at night, claiming that it was destroyed by our army, and immediately began to bombard the Beidaying barracks in Shenyang with artillery. Three hundred of our garrison troops died unyielding. The garrison troops in other areas retreated due to the suddenness of the incident. The Japanese army advanced south towards Shenyang, while the northern route launched a fierce attack on Changchun. After occupying it, they advanced along the Jichang Railway and invaded Jilin. On September 21, they occupied the entire province without firing a shot. From September 18 to the end of September, all important towns in Liaoning and Jilin provinces were occupied. Jinzhou fell on November 18. From then on, the three northeastern provinces were subjected to the Japanese army's tyrannical power, but the volunteer armies organized by the people of the Northeast continued to fight against the enemy in secret. On December 26, the Japanese army attacked Jinzhou in three routes, completely driving the Feng army into the pass.

International Reactions and Investigations

On September 21, 1931, the representative of our government in Geneva wrote to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, requesting that the Council of the League of Nations pay attention to the Sino-Japanese dispute, and in accordance with Article 11 of the Covenant, requested the Council to "immediately take measures to prevent the expansion of the situation endangering international peace."

The Council of the League of Nations held meetings on September 30, October 13-24, and November 16 respectively. Finally, a League of Nations Commission of Inquiry was established, consisting of five members selected by the Chairman of the Council and approved by the two parties concerned. The qualifications of the members were approved by the Council on January 14, 1932. The list is as follows: Lord Lytton (UK), Major General Frank Ross McCoy (USA), Lieutenant General Henri Claudel (France), Count Luigi Aldrovandi Marescotti (Italy), Dr. Heinrich Schnee (Germany). On January 21, the Commission of Inquiry met twice in Geneva and unanimously elected Lord Lytton as Chairman. In accordance with the resolution of the Council of the League of Nations on December 10, both the Chinese and Japanese governments had the "right to send a member to assist the Commission of Inquiry." Subsequently, Japan sent Yoshida, the ambassador to Turkey, as its representative, and our representative was Mr. Gu Weijun.

The Commission of Inquiry did not arrive in the Northeast until April 20, stayed for about six weeks, and the Commission of Inquiry's report was not signed in Beiping, China until September 4.

At that time, among the international reactions to the Japanese invasion of China, only the United States' attitude was more obvious. In 1932, Secretary of State Stimson issued the famous so-called "non-recognition doctrine," refusing to recognize any results caused by force, and reaffirming the open-door policy. Britain made little comment. The Soviet Union, seeing Japan seize the Chinese Eastern Railway, did not interfere and later used diplomatic means to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway to Japan.

The report of the League of Nations Commission of Inquiry was signed by all members on September 4, 1932, and sent directly to Geneva for publication. Although the report stated respect for Chinese sovereignty, in order to take into account the actual situation, it suggested organizing an autonomous government in the three northeastern provinces, with advisors sent by various countries to participate together. At that time, Japan still regarded the report as waste paper and ignored it. At the end of the same year, the Japanese army continued to attack Yuguan and Rehe. On February 24, 1933, the League of Nations conducted mediation again, but Japan refused to accept it and announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations. The League of Nations then resolved not to recognize Japan's occupation of the Northeast.

New Reflections

After the Lugouqiao Incident, the all-out war of resistance began, lasting eight years and achieving final victory. According to the Cairo Declaration issued on December 1, 1943, it was determined that sovereignty over the three northeastern provinces would be returned to our country. In the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance" signed in August 1945, the Soviet government also recognized the three northeastern provinces as part of China, reaffirmed respect for China's full sovereignty in the three northeastern provinces, and reaffirmed recognition of their territorial and administrative integrity. The national humiliation of "September 18" was completely washed away, but when the national army went to accept it, unexpected complications arose, and the communist army obstructed the process, delaying the time and making the Northeast issue increasingly complicated. For more than ten years, the suffering of the compatriots in the Northeast has still not been alleviated. On the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the September 18th Incident, reflecting on the past and contemplating the present, one cannot help but feel deeply moved.

### Social Services: Responding to Readers

Legal Questions

(1) Reversing a Wrongful Conviction

Wei Xinmin asks: (1) In the summer of the 30th year of the Republic of China, a communist Li was assassinated. His younger brother accused my nephew (who was only eighteen years old) of being an accomplice to the county judicial office. The judicial office, based solely on the plaintiff's statement, sentenced him to fifteen years in prison. Upon appeal, the sentence was reduced to seven years and six months. We originally intended to apply for a retrial, but due to economic constraints, the wrongful conviction was never overturned. He has now been imprisoned for more than forty months and is seriously ill in prison. The detention center refuses to allow him to be released on bail for medical treatment. What should we do? (2) My relative, Mr. So-and-so, lost his wife last year. It happened that his distant sister-in-law, Ms. So-and-so, was a widow without children. Later, due to mutual comfort, they fell in love and she became pregnant. If she gives birth to a son in the future, Ms. So-and-so intends to keep him as an adopted son. I wonder if the relatives have the right to interfere? Can the law provide protection?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers]: (1) (A) If the case has not been finalized and he is still in detention, the procedures should be handled in accordance with Article 114 of the Revised Code of Criminal Procedure. Check the first paragraph of that article, which stipulates that if a report is made requesting the suspension of detention, it cannot be rejected if the third reason is that the person is currently suffering from a disease and it is difficult to recover without bail for medical treatment. (B) If the case has been finalized and is being executed, the regulations in Article 471 of the Code of Criminal Procedure should be followed. If a person sentenced to imprisonment is currently suffering from a disease and there is a risk that execution will endanger their life, the execution should be suspended under the direction of the prosecutor until they recover or the event causing the suspension ceases. However, this is not bail for medical treatment, but rather sending the prisoner to a hospital or other appropriate place. (2) The current law does not have hereditary succession. The adoption of children should be done by the adopting person themselves. A spouse cannot adopt on their behalf after their death. Children born to Ms. So-and-so and Mr. So-and-so are children born out of wedlock and cannot be adopted.

### Infant and Child Health Care Hospital: Continues to Accept Infants and Children

Original Site Converted to Pediatric Outpatient Department

The Shanghai Infant and Child Health Care Hospital has a large number of infants and children being fostered from various sources, and the original site is insufficient. It has now found a second hospital at No. 7, Lane 24, North Hai'ning Road, and continues to accept fostered infants and children from three months to two years old. Registration can be made at the main hospital at No. 173, Lane 1, East Baoxing Road. The main hospital has now been converted to a pediatric outpatient department, with specialized doctors rotating shifts for consultations.

### Tracking Down Missing Persons

Yan Bingxing Searching for Son: Dear Editor, I respectfully write to you. My son, Yan Gaoyun, also known as Taisheng, is 29 years old this year. He is from Dongjiangpu, Dinghai, Zhejiang. He was originally learning a trade in the machinery department of Yisheng Foreign Company on Xiaoshadu Road, Shanghai. He went missing on August 18, the 26th year of the Republic of China, a few days after the outbreak of the Shanghai war, on Hengfeng Road, Zhabei. Later, he sent a letter through someone saying that he was working in the 88th Division's rescue team. Since then, there has been no news. It has been nine years. Yongxing is nearly sixty years old and has only this one son. If anything unexpected happens, my later years will be unimaginable! I am especially writing to request that you publish the original letter. If anyone knows his whereabouts and informs me, I would be extremely grateful. Respectfully, Yan Yongxing. Correspondence address: c/o Yanping Road 116, Shanghai

Searching for Brother Song Jie: Dear Editor, I originally lived in Daximen, Huaiyuan County, Anhui. I have three brothers. My third brother joined the army in the 26th year of the Republic of China and joined the student team. Later, he was reorganized into the teaching team and lived at Wuhan University, Hubei Province. Later, he was sent to Guilin and incorporated into the second regiment headquarters of the Army Signal Corps. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China, he joined the expeditionary force. It has been more than a year since the victory, but there has been no news. The old and young at home are restless day and night. I hope that close relatives and friends, if they know the address of Song Jie (Song Tongqiang), will kindly inform me by letter. Your merit will be immeasurable. Correspondence address: Song Pintang, Song Gaoduifang, Daximen, Huaiyuan County, Anhui. Refugee Song Tongming respectfully writes.

### My Views on the Roosevelt Library

The Roosevelt Library, which has been promoted for a long time and is about to be prepared in Shanghai, according to a Nanjing dispatch in the 13th of this newspaper, was initiated by Director Zhu after returning to Nanjing and discussing setting it up in Shanghai. It was initiated by domestic peace-loving people and those who love peace after the victory of justice, to commemorate the great achievements of the international great man, former US President Roosevelt. In my opinion, since the library site has been decided to be in Shanghai, given the size of Shanghai and the large population, a "Promotion Department" should be established. "Branches" or "District Reading Rooms" should be widely established, like the "Reading Rooms" run by the British and American embassy press offices today, displaying the latest books, newspapers, and magazines. Reading time should be extended as much as possible, and working staff should adopt a rotational system. Public holidays should also allow the public to go and make full use of the facilities. Before the library is prepared and opened, large-scale public lectures by celebrities, current affairs exhibitions, current affairs forums, current affairs tests, etc. should be held from time to time to introduce the national conditions of China and the United States. Efforts should be made to ensure that the public has a better understanding of the international situation and the domestic political situation. After opening, methods of promoting friendship between China and the United States should be used as much as possible. A "Reading Guidance Department" (or "Reference Department") should be established to answer readers' questions and compile books and periodicals such as catalogs, indexes, lecture recordings, and collections of speeches for the public to refer to. (Yang Changzhi)

### University Exam Results Announced Too Late

Dear Editor: I had no choice but to come to Shanghai to take the university entrance exams. However, after taking the first exam, because the results were not announced for a long time, I had to apply to another school, otherwise I was afraid of losing the chance to study. However, the schools announce the results too late, not only wasting time but also consuming money. Among them, a certain joint university's exam has been going on for more than a month, but the results have not yet been announced. Even Jiaotong University is taking more than three weeks, which makes people anxious. Therefore, I urge the schools to announce the results as soon as possible. I would be very grateful. (A Candidate)

### Please Announce Loan Recipients Early

Dear Editor: I am an orphan who lost my parents early in life. Fortunately, I was raised by my uncle. This year, I graduated from Husi Middle School in Shanghai and am now entering Zhonghua Vocational School. The tuition fee for this semester is huge, reaching my uncle's entire month's salary. My uncle is a clerk in a cloth store. His monthly income, after household expenses, is hardly enough to cover my tuition fees. Therefore, I applied for a loan from the Municipal Education Association. With school starting soon, I watched as my classmates took their payment receipts to the school to complete the admission procedures. I urgently inquired at the Municipal Education Association, and was told that the results would be known by the end of the month. If this is the case, I will be shut out of the school again. I beg the Municipal Education Association to announce the results early so that loan recipients can benefit in a timely manner. Thank you very much! (A Loan Recipient, Jin Zhenhua)

### Municipal Vocational High School Should Reduce Tuition Fees

Dear Editor: We are a group of students from the Shanghai Municipal Senior Vocational School. Our parents are almost all public school teachers, and impoverished children from rural areas (many from northern Jiangsu). Because they cannot afford to attend high school and university, we, a group of poor students, transferred to this ideal school last winter. We thought we could study for free and learn some specialized skills to become mid-level technical personnel. Because we are poor, we did not dare to expect too much. In the first semester, the miscellaneous fees were 6,000 yuan, the food fees were 10,000 yuan, and the book fees were 30,000 yuan, which was enough. However, this semester, the first notification stated that the total miscellaneous fees were 46,000 yuan. But on September 8, another notice said that the amount would be determined separately, with dormitory fees of 30,000 yuan, construction fees of 20,000 yuan, teachers' appreciation fees of 30,000 yuan, miscellaneous fees of 8,000 yuan, and food fees of 100,000 yuan for the first month, and all must be paid in full at the time of registration, otherwise their student status would be revoked. This was truly a bolt from the blue, almost shattering our ideal dreams. Where can our parents find this huge amount of 250,000 yuan on short notice?

Now we only ask the former principal, Deputy Director Li Ximou, and the secretary of the Education Bureau, Director Wang Ruchang, to pity this group of poor students and reduce the tuition fees as much as possible to avoid the pain of dropping out of school. We would be endlessly grateful! (Students from the Shanghai Municipal Senior Vocational School, Textile, Civil Engineering, and Electrical Engineering Classes)

### Public Teacher Material Allocation Should Have Supplemental Registration

The Shanghai public teacher material allocation registration took place during the summer vacation. All schools hurriedly completed the registration within the first prescribed date. However, some schools' newly appointed teachers were not confirmed until early September, and by this time the list had already been submitted, so the new teachers were not included. Therefore, there has been a request for supplemental registration. It is hoped that this low-priced allocation right can universally benefit public school teachers, and the authorities should make special arrangements to allow supplemental registration once. (Li Shi)

### Proposal to Convert Nunneries into Schools

Dear Editor: Next door to my house is a nunnery. There are dozens of nuns, large and small, living there. They own a lot of real estate. Besides chanting scriptures all day long, they mostly gamble and extract commissions. Now, schools are suffering from a lack of school buildings, and tuition fees are so expensive. Many people are unable to attend school, and many people are displaced. Why not convert these nunneries into schools and allocate the proceeds from their properties to relief funds? Wouldn't this be "turning uselessness into usefulness"? (Neighbor)

### Are Military Rice Exempted?

The Shanghai County Government previously received a provincial order to collect military rice, one sheng per mu (priced at 24,000 yuan per shi). Later, it was reported that the provincial council had requested and obtained an exemption, but the grain that had already been paid had not yet been returned. After a month or so, the county is now collecting local construction fees. According to the collector, the military grain that was previously paid can now be exempted. May I ask whether the higher authorities have actually exempted this military rice? If it has been exempted, why change the name? If it has not been exempted, it can be collected, so why change the name? (Hu Zhifu)

### Establishing European Peace: Still Far From the Goal, The German and Austrian Problems Are Complex and Difficult to Resolve

— Translated by our Newsroom from the New York Times Magazine

Although the progress of the Paris Peace Conference has been quite slow, with the exception of the Trieste port and its hinterland issue, and the somewhat difficult Greek-Albanian border issue, most of the remaining issues have been gradually resolved. For example, the draft treaties with Romania and Finland have been reviewed and are ready for signing. Therefore, recent general opinion believes that the review of the draft treaties with the five former enemy states—Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland—is expected to be completed before October 15th. Diplomats from various countries can then travel to New York to participate in the United Nations General Assembly scheduled for October 23rd.

But is a new foundation for European peace being laid on this basis? The answer is that we are still far from this goal, because the most important German and Austrian issues have not even begun to be discussed. Even if they were to be discussed, they would certainly be more troublesome and complex, and by no means comparable to the treaty issues with Germany's five former vassal states. Therefore, we will examine the German question here.

The German question is important for two reasons: (1) Germany is the most populous and industrially developed country in Europe, and also the richest in coal production, so it is a crucial determining factor for the future of Europe; (2) Germany is the main target of open and covert struggles between the Soviet Union and Western countries. The London Times recently stated: "A divided Germany means a divided Europe, which could lead to all sorts of disputes." Today's Germany is divided and occupied by the four powers of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France. Although Molotov has said that the Soviet Union does not oppose German unification, the fact is that Germany will remain divided for a long time, due to disagreements among the victorious powers. If there were not such deep contradictions among the allied countries as there are now, the German question would not be so difficult to solve.

Divergences Between Soviet and American Views

The divergence between the views of the Soviet Union and Western countries can be said to have reached an extreme. Not only do they differ in their struggle for power and their political and economic goals, but they also have mutually contradictory explanations of the defects of the current world and how to correct them. The Soviet Union has its own political and economic theories, and to achieve its goals, it is willing to use any means. Therefore, in the Soviet-occupied zone, the four freedoms that we fought for in the war can be disregarded at any time, and all industry and commerce are placed under state control. This situation is, of course, incompatible with the habits and goals of Western countries, because in the eyes of Western countries, free trade is the most important condition for the stability of the world economic system and the establishment of peace.

At the same time, in the thinking of the Soviets, the capitalist world is bound to decline and collapse, so they want to use the various weaknesses of capitalism to accelerate the realization of the better world imagined by the Soviet leaders. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to find common ground between capitalism and communism to solve an important problem.

The differences in thinking between the Soviet Union and Western countries will, of course, have a very significant impact on the resolution of the German question.

The Soviet Union's policy towards Germany was first explained by Molotov in Paris; he said that the Soviet Union hoped that Germany would become a strong country, maintain its status as an industrial nation, and did not approve of dividing Germany.

Mutual Suspicion

But although the Soviet Union advocates German reunification, it does not take consistent steps with Western countries. The Soviet-occupied zone of Germany has already been implementing the Soviet system to a certain extent, and there is no sign that this is temporary. If the Soviet Union hopes that Germany will become a strong, prosperous, productive, and unified country, as Molotov said, then it certainly does not want Germany to join the increasingly declining capitalist system. Therefore, some people believe that the Soviet Union's goal for Germany is to gradually control the entire country, in order to win the sympathy of the German people under the guise of national unity. The United Kingdom and the United States also hope for German reunification, but do not want Germany to implement the Soviet system, which would further expand the Soviet Union's power, eventually controlling Germany and even all of Europe.

Therefore, it is extremely difficult to find an appropriate way to solve the German question. The Soviet Union and Western countries each have their own views, and at the same time, everyone wants to promote their own views throughout Germany. This is the crux of the problem. Everyone is harboring suspicions about the other party, so everyone wants to win control of Europe.

The four foreign ministers have decided to discuss the German and Austrian issues before the end of this year. The world is watching to see how they will use their wisdom and courage to solve this issue, which is most crucial for the future of Europe. (South)

### Wallace's Speech Causes a Great Disturbance

— Chu Yukun

Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes gave a speech in Stuttgart, emphasizing the U.S. policy toward Germany, which caused all sorts of speculation internationally about the U.S.-Soviet diplomatic war. And this week, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wallace gave a speech in New York, arguing that U.S. foreign policy needed to change direction, which not only caused a great disturbance in the U.S. diplomatic community, but also internationally. Hearing two completely different arguments within five or six days, all countries were panic-stricken, especially the United Kingdom, which has a direct interest in the matter, as if it were suffering from a fever, hot for a while, then cold for a while. Fortunately, President Truman issued a statement on the 14th, stating that there had been no change in U.S. foreign policy. This great disturbance began to subside, and countries were able to breathe a sigh of relief.

Wallace's Speech Is Pro-Soviet and Anti-British

Secretary Wallace gave a speech to the left-wing Citizens Political Action Committee in the United States on the 13th, the main points of which were four: (1) The United Kingdom is pursuing an imperialist policy in the Near East, and the Soviet Union is also pursuing a retaliatory policy, which is enough to drag the United States into war; the United States must adopt a clear and realistic policy to avoid war. (2) The United States should observe the world political situation with its own eyes, and not with a pro-British or pro-Soviet outlook; although Americans love the British, it is wrong for the United States to use the United Kingdom as the basis for its foreign policy. (3) The United States and the Soviet Union should divide their spheres of influence and not interfere with each other. (4) World peace requires China to maintain a neutral position, both politically and economically, and must be outside the two major spheres of influence; but China should open its doors to world trade.

The Great Disturbance Has Tended to Subside

Wallace's speech, in his capacity as a minister, was originally not worthy of attention in the United States, where there is freedom of speech. However, Wallace is the only surviving minister from the era of former President Roosevelt, and has always been regarded as a pro-Soviet figure, and has the ambition to restore Roosevelt's policies. Moreover, before the speech, Wallace had asked President Truman to approve the contents of the speech, and afterwards Truman publicly stated that he agreed with Wallace's speech. Therefore, it caused a great disturbance in the U.S. diplomatic community, and international public opinion was also greatly shocked. Because Wallace's speech, whether in spirit or in substance, contradicted and ran counter to Byrnes' speech in Germany. Therefore, Byrnes was "furious" when he heard this shocking news from afar in Paris, and Vandenberg also said, "I cannot obey two secretaries of state at the same time." From this, it can be seen that U.S. foreign policy has reached a crossroads, and President Truman still needs to make a decision on which way to go.

President Truman's statement was finally issued on the 14th. He said: "My initial statement was only to express support for Secretary Wallace's right to deliver this speech, but I do not intend to use this speech as a statement of our country's foreign policy." He also said: "The established foreign policy of our government has not changed, and no major changes can be made to foreign policy without discussion by the President and the Secretary of State and the leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives." Therefore, the great disturbance caused by Wallace's speech has tended to subside.

New Troubles Arise at the Paris Peace Conference

The Paris Peace Conference is scheduled to end before October 23, and various committees have to step up their work, preferably completing their tasks before October 5. Therefore, the atmosphere in the Luxembourg Palace suddenly became tense, and the representatives of the United Kingdom and the United States took the opportunity to adopt a diplomatic offensive: (1) The United Kingdom and the United States announced that they would give up their demands for reparations from Italy; (2) They opposed Bulgaria's territorial claims against Greece, and advocated the demilitarization of Bulgaria's southern border. When the Committee on Territorial and Political Issues of Bulgaria discussed Greece's proposed amendments to the Bulgarian border on the 13th, it caused a disturbance, and the representatives of the five Slavic countries left the meeting before the end. At the same time, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov seized the opportunity to launch a counter-attack against the Anglo-American bloc by using the issue of the port of Trieste. In a speech to the Committee on Political and Territorial Issues of Italy, he advocated the establishment of a "democratic autonomous government" in Trieste, and satirized the British political system as being out of step with the world trend, and that the British proposal for Trieste was no different from its implementation in its colonies.

After Molotov's speech was delivered, the Paris Peace Conference faced two major problems again: (1) the issue of the status of the port of Trieste; (2) the issue of the border of Bulgaria, which threatened to break up the peace conference; at the same time, it would also have a significant impact on the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States.

Palestine Is Even More Terrifying

Palestine has caused a great disturbance because of the illegal immigration of Jews, which has plunged the entire Near East into a state of turmoil. In order to solve this problem, the British authorities convened the Palestine Round Table Conference in London on the 10th of this month, inviting Arabs and Jews to gather together and calmly discuss this issue, so as to establish a solution that can satisfy all three parties; unexpectedly, on the opening day, no representatives from Arab and Jewish people's groups attended, making the Palestine Conference open in a pessimistic and depressed atmosphere.

At the conference, the Arabs opposed the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, and also opposed the partition plan proposed by the United Kingdom, which has invisibly fallen into a stalemate. At the same time, in the holy city, because of the riots of Jewish terrorists in various places, the Arabs went on strike for a day on the 14th to protest, and the situation in Palestine has entered a new stage. The past seven years of non-aggression between the two races of Jews and Arabs have been completely broken. Therefore, the Palestine issue is becoming more complicated, making British politicians and diplomats feel more "headache". (September 16)

### The First Aviator

— Translated by Xi

Wright the First

Orville Wright, one of the Wright brothers who invented the first airplane, is still alive today, at the age of seventy-five. In American history, Wright is probably the only great inventor who can witness his invention transform the world into a different situation.

Orville Wright grew up in an era of fantasy, when children browsed ideal science fiction novels, dreaming of space ships and flying arrows. He and his brother Wilbur Wright accepted that fantasy and transformed it into reality. He shortened the distance between Washington and Tokyo to a short distance that can be reached in twenty-seven and a half hours. The secret of flight he discovered is not only the foundation of today's giant aircraft, but also the foundation of future rocket ships.

Wright became interested in machines in his childhood. He made kites for his friends. At the age of twelve, he became interested in printing presses, and at the age of seventeen, he built a practical printing press. Later, he also learned to make lathes and bicycles, and his results were very satisfactory.

Wright first had the idea of flying when he was lying in bed with typhoid fever in 1896. One day, his brother brought in a newspaper, reporting the news that German glider expert Lilienthal had died in a glider accident. This touched Wright's imagination, thinking that since Lilienthal was dead, someone else must continue his career. So he made up his mind to devote himself to the study of aviation.

The Wright brothers began to dabble in all books related to aviation, studying while experimenting. In the spring of 1901, everything was ready, and they began to do field flights. They chose the coastal beaches of North Carolina as the experimental site. They brought a biplane glider to "Kill Devil Hills", and took off into the air with the wind. By repeatedly experimenting like this, they learned to fly. They flew farther and farther, and for longer and longer. At this point, they further added a variable engine to their biplane. After several trials and improvements, they finally made the first test flight of an engine airplane on December 17, 1903, flying thirty-one miles in fifty-one seconds. After this news was published in the newspaper, it did not attract people's attention. They tried their best to get the government's recognition, but the result was disappointment.

They changed their strategy and went to Europe to promote it, and unexpectedly received a grand welcome from the Europeans. Politicians and royal families from various countries entertained them and feasted on them. King Edward of England and King Emmanuel of Italy personally watched them fly, and the German prince insisted on riding in their plane. King Alfonso of Spain sat in the plane and took a photo. They publicly performed flying skills in every capital city in Europe, and were celebrated and rewarded everywhere. When they returned to their hometown in the United States, their compatriots finally woke up, and they celebrated for two days in a row.

Although the Wright brothers received a grand welcome in Europe, they were not satisfied with this. Their ambition was to have the U.S. War Department adopt their planes. They constantly conducted various experiments. Whenever a new invention of aviation parts was added, Orville Wright would personally test it. On September 17, 1908, an accident finally occurred. The plane suddenly failed when landing, and another pilot died on the spot. Wright broke several ribs and femurs, but escaped death. A friend asked him: "Are your nerves affected?"

Wright seemed not to understand what he meant, and asked back: "Nerves? Do you mean to ask if I dare to fly again next time? … My only worry is that my experiment may not be completed this year."

In 1912, Wilbur Wright died of typhoid fever. Although Orville continued to conduct flight experiments until 1915, the situation was ultimately different. He lacked a capable assistant; he was lonely. After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, airplanes suddenly changed from a sports device to a murder weapon. As various military aircraft appeared one after another, Wright's name was gradually forgotten by the world.

Although Orville Wright is now seventy-five years old, he has not lost the perseverance that he had in his youth. He is very kind and humble. Although he has received awards and medals from universities and academic groups in various countries, he does not like to brag to others. He refuses to write an autobiography, and his photos are rarely found in newspapers.

But his great achievements will never be forgotten by the world. The late President Roosevelt once praised him: "Mr. Wright has given us these great defensive weapons—a new combat power, a new peace guarantee. Undoubtedly, he is one of the few great men of our time in America."

Spring and Autumn

### Friendship

— By O. Henry, Translated by Tao Liang

On a desolate street, a newly appointed police officer walked with dignity. This majestic posture was not meant to be shown to passersby, it seemed to be a habit he had developed. Because at that time, night had enveloped the earth, and from time to time there was a cold wind blowing, and a trace of drizzle drifting. Although it was not yet curfew time, there was not a single figure to be found on the street.

The police officer wielded his baton with various skillful and beautiful techniques, his two sharp eyes constantly patrolling the doors of various shops and residences, and the quiet roads. A few stores specializing in night markets revealed faint lights, and the rest were almost all closed. They relied entirely on flashlights to see the scenery in the distance.

Suddenly, he noticed a burly man leaning against the door of a store—in a dark corner. So the police officer slowly walked towards him, and the man also came up to meet him.

"Officer, is there anything wrong?" he asked the police officer, "I'm just waiting here for a friend I promised twenty years ago. Don't think this is a ridiculous thing. If you don't believe me, I can talk to you about it. Many years ago, wasn't there a 'Malandi' hotel here?..."

"That's right." The police officer interrupted the man's words, interjecting: "This hotel only closed down in the spring five years ago, right?"

As the police officer replied, the man struck a match to light a cigar. In the instant the match lit, the police officer recognized his face: a pale face, a pair of small, black eyes, with a wide scar next to his right eyebrow. The diamond pin on his tie reflected the brief light of the match.

"Twenty years ago tonight..." the man said, "Jimmy Wells—he was the best of my many friends—and I had dinner together at the 'Malandi' hotel here... Jimmy and I had a friendship that was as close as glue. At that time, I was only eighteen years old, and Jimmy was two years older than me... The next morning, for the sake of survival, I had to leave New York and go to the western part of the country. At that time, Jimmy refused to follow me, always wanting to stay in New York. So when we parted that day, the two of us agreed that twenty years later today, no matter what our circumstances, whether rich or poor; no matter how far away in the north or west, we would travel a long distance to come, and neither of us could break the appointment."

"Oh! That's very interesting." The police officer said lightly, "But, in my opinion, this seems too long, twenty years?… Do you know Jimmy Wells' current situation?"

"This—" The man was obviously stumped by the question, "At first, we corresponded with each other, but three years later, our information was cut off... I know Jimmy is a man of his word, and he will definitely come, unless he is dead." As he spoke, he took out a pocket watch with jewels inlaid on the lid from his pocket.

"It's three minutes to ten." The man said, "Twenty years ago, we parted right when the clock was striking ten!"

"You must be living more comfortably in the western part of the country."

"Much more comfortable than in New York. I only wish Jimmy could have half of my wealth... Alas! He lacked the spirit of adventure too much. Staying in New York made his life become rigid. If he could have gone with me to take a chance, maybe he would have become sophisticated and brave!"

The police officer waved his baton, took a few steps, then turned his head and said to the man, "For the sake of my duties, I'll go first. I hope your friend can arrive in time. Goodbye!"

"I believe he will come. Goodbye, friend." The man said affirmatively, watching the police officer walk forward along the sidewalk.

The rain was getting heavier and heavier, and the wind was also much stronger than before. The man who had traveled thousands of miles to keep an appointment—a twenty-year-old appointment—was still pacing back and forth in front of the store, patiently waiting while smoking a cigar.

Half an hour passed before a tall man in an overcoat ran over from across the street.

"Bob, is that you?" The tall man asked suspiciously.

"Jimmy!" He cried out in joy, piercing the quiet atmosphere nearby.

"Ah!" The man in the overcoat shook the other man's hand, "You are indeed Bob, I knew you wouldn't fail to come as long as you were alive. Twenty years is indeed a long time... It's a pity that the hotel has already closed, otherwise we could have gone in for another round of drinking, couldn't we? Bob, what impression did the west give you?"

"Not bad, my desires were satisfied there." He suddenly changed the subject, "Jimmy, I didn't expect you to grow so tall."

"Hmm!"

"Jimmy, you probably didn't have much success staying in New York!"

"Indeed, I'm just a small official in the municipal government now... Bob, let's talk about everything since we parted!"

The two of them walked excitedly, the friend who had been waiting anxiously, because of the development of his career! Excitedly recounting his success, while the other listened quietly, without saying a word.

When they walked past a corner, the neon lights from the company shone brightly, and the two of them couldn't help but look at each other at the same time.

Bob suddenly stopped moving forward, roaring at the man in the overcoat.

"Humph! You're not Jimmy, he wouldn't have been as ugly as you are twenty years ago."

"Friend, wait a moment, even a good person can become a bad person." The man said helplessly, "Bob, the police station has already received a telegram from Chicago about your matter. There are orders to go there once. Before you get to the police station, there's a patrol officer Jimmy Wells entrusted me to give you this note."

He unfolded the small note, his face turning even paler, and his hands trembling involuntarily.

There were not many sentences on that small note, and the handwriting was also very scribbled, obviously it was written by him temporarily. —

"Bob:

Don't blame me for breaking my promise. I came a long time ago. I understood who you were when you struck the match. For the sake of friendship, I couldn't bear to personally arrest a close friend from twenty years ago, who is now a wanted criminal. Bob, I have entrusted an undercover detective to settle this official business!

Bob, you think I can be called a friend, right! Jimmy Wells"

### The Oldest Existing Chinese Poems

— Cang Geng

The process of forming characters was still underway during the Yin Dynasty, as evidenced by unearthed oracle bone inscriptions. So, what are the oldest poems we can reliably trust today?

The "South Wind Song" and "Qing Yun Song" attributed to Emperor Yao in the book "Shizi" are obviously unfounded claims. The nursery rhyme attributed to Emperor Yao's time in "Liezi" is even less reliable, given that "Liezi" is a forged work attributed to Jin Ren. Therefore, it can be said that all poems attributed to the Tang, Yu, and Xia dynasties in various books are untrustworthy.

I remember that Mr. Wang Renshu, in his literary reader, cited the "La Ci" (Sacrifice Song) from the "Jiao Te Sheng" (Sacrificial Rites) section of the "Book of Rites" as the earliest ancient poem. The song goes: "Earth returns to its dwelling, water returns to its source, insects cease their activity, plants and trees return to their homes." Judging from the wording, it indeed possesses a primitive and simple style, reflecting the ancient people's concept of worshiping nature spirits. However, the "Book of Rites" is a book from the Han Dynasty, so the claim that the "La Ci" was written by Yi Qi cannot be established. At the very least, the "La Ci" is a work from the Zhou Dynasty. As for the "Yellow Emperor's Broken Bamboo Song" in "Wu Yue Chunqiu," it is nothing more than a forgery by later generations.

Therefore, many literary historians omit all existing poems before the Zhou Dynasty, simply regarding the three hundred poems of the "Book of Songs" as the origin of Chinese poetry. This is because they cannot find any earlier and more reliable poems.

In fact, the origin of ballads and language is parallel. When humans progressed to the point where they could use writing to record events and things, their language, like ballads, carried a sense of antiquity. Therefore, the recorded characters and phrases also carried rhythm. We can see this from the earliest "Zhou Song" poems in the "Book of Songs." The prose-like phrases of the Zhou Jin inscriptions are later than the "Zhou Song." Therefore, we only need to look in the oldest cultural relics and books to find the oldest Chinese poems.

Everyone considers the "Book of Changes" a more reliable book than the "Book of Songs," with its initial compilation dating back to the late Yin Dynasty. In this book, we can find very complete poems. For example:

The woman carries a basket,
There is no treasure.
The man cuts the sheep,
There is no blood.

What a beautiful picture, with words and rhythms so solemn and simple. There is also a love poem for newlyweds, which is also very complete:

The cranes cry in the shade,
Their chicks respond.
I have a good goblet,
I will share it with you! (尸 is pronounced bo)

Who can say that these two poems are worse than the three hundred poems of the "Book of Songs"? Therefore, the lines of the "Book of Changes" are the oldest existing Chinese poems.

Literary history and poetry history should begin with the lines of the "Book of Changes."

### Cherishing the Remaining Spring (One of the Dreams Continued in Yangzhou)

— Hong Wei Fa

It was something that happened more than ten years ago. "Cherishing the Remaining Spring" - what an elegant and unique name, yet it was used by a very small teahouse in the north of the Yangzhou drill ground. It was always something that caught people's attention.

Inside the teahouse, there were only three or five tables, and only a few regular customers would come every day, leisurely reading newspapers, reciting poems, or playing chess. The owner of the teahouse was named Gao, and because of a physical defect, people called him Hunchback Gao. He seemed to take it in stride, because in his view, calling a cow a horse was neither an honor nor a disgrace. He managed the accounts while also taking the time to join some of the old customers in reading newspapers, reciting poems, or playing chess. It was said that he had already compiled many poems, but had not yet published them, but famous lines such as "Time is like ink, ground short; current events are like chess, with more captures" were recited by word of mouth. Wasn't that very fresh?

The furnishings inside "Cherishing the Remaining Spring" were all antique. In addition to some calligraphy and paintings on the walls, there were also poems written by customers in response to each other, as well as notices from certain customers soliciting poems, couplets, and riddle poems. Sometimes, the results of the solicitations were posted, along with the distribution method of the prizes. Speaking of prizes, they were also very elegant and unique. The first prize might be a pot of tea and a bowl of noodles, the second prize was a pot of tea and a bowl of dried bean curd threads, the third prize was a pot of tea, and those below the fourth prize received a few envelopes and stationery. Therefore, the atmosphere here was very refined, and those who wore short shirts and lacked ink in their bellies seemed to feel ashamed and dared not enter.

You could also eat meals in "Cherishing the Remaining Spring," but they were all very simple, just stir-fried meat, braised tofu, and the like. The owner would take the customers' needs into account very carefully, not making too much or too good, lest the customers couldn't finish it and spend too much. If customers had any special cooking methods, they could also personally go to the kitchen, select their own ingredients, and make their own dishes. In short, the owner always stood on the customers' side, fully expressing that he was not just in it for the money, like a great hermit mingling in the marketplace.

The owner was originally from Fujian, but had lived in Yangzhou for many years. His uncle, it was said, had worked as a record keeper in the Yangzhou government office in the late Qing Dynasty. Because he liked to use large dots when correcting documents, he got the nickname "Big Dot Gao." Later, his family accumulated some money, and the owner of "Cherishing the Remaining Spring," Hunchback Gao, opened a large noodle restaurant in the drill ground. The noodle restaurant was called "Keke Ju." Didn't Han Yu say in his "Preface to Sending Li Yuan Back to Pan Valley," "Gathered from the mountains, delicious to eat; fished from the water, fresh to eat"? This was the basis for the name "Keke Ju."

After Gao Hunchback opened "Keke Ju," because his family was also engaged in writing, the men of letters among the customers often received special treatment. This was probably the meaning of mutual appreciation. In addition to taking care of the store, the owner would talk about poetry and essays with these men of letters, which was very leisurely. Unfortunately, these men of letters were mostly not wealthy, and most of them had their tea and noodles charged to their accounts every day. As time went on, debts accumulated and there was little cash, and the owner finally had cash flow problems and could no longer sustain it, so he had to close "Keke Ju." After "Keke Ju" closed, those men of letters who owed money naturally felt a little bad, but if they wanted to restore the owner to his original state, it seemed beyond their power, so they pooled some money and had the owner open another small teahouse. It was named "Cherishing the Remaining Spring," and it really held an infinite sense of attachment to the past "Keke Ju."

The transformation from "Keke Ju" to "Cherishing the Remaining Spring" was like going from the full bloom of mid-spring to the declining beauty of late spring. "Cherishing the Remaining Spring" was lovable, but the spring light was always going to depart, which symbolized the fate of "Cherishing the Remaining Spring." Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, it closed again, following in the footsteps of "Keke Ju." The Tang Dynasty poem says: "The third month is exactly the thirtieth day, the spring light departs from my bitter chanting body; let's not sleep together tonight, before the dawn bell it is still spring." It is conceivable that Gao Hunchback, who loved elegance, would easily think of this poem when "Cherishing the Remaining Spring" closed, and would also have the emotions expressed in this poem!

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 36

— Ye Jingfeng

"Judging from the facts, it is likely that the deputy captain has achieved his goal of escorting the distinguished guest; because two battlefield patrols have guided them back to the original defense, or to the Fengtai train station nearby. At the time, Fengtai was in the thick of battle, and no one could prove whether a distinguished guest had arrived, or had already taken a special train..." He frowned, thinking about the complexity of the problem.

"Then, maybe it was a car accident..." I offered him a way out.

"Yes!" He seized on my suggestion, wanting to vaguely conclude the incident. "I heard that the deputy captain had drunk an excessive amount of alcohol... The accident seems somewhat inevitable...?"

This was an unexpected turn of events. I never dreamed I would have such a convenient opportunity to exploit. I secretly rejoiced in my heart, and at the same time decided to have this guy accompany me to Changxindian.

Things proceeded smoothly: this guy accompanied me obsequiously along the way, first going to the scene of the accident to investigate. The entire route was free of obstacles; all the sentry posts and patrols knew that we were special investigators handling the accident. I took him to the triangular area not far from the intersection of the Pinghan and Pinglu railways, and said: I have other missions, please help yourself and wait for my call. If this guy hadn't encountered this disturbing event, making him lose his composure, it really wouldn't have been so easy to deal with him. In order to conclude this headless case, I called him the next day, telling him to end the case by claiming it was a car accident and submit a report. In this way, I also concluded a worry in my heart.

In total, from leaving Changxindian to returning to Changxindian, it was exactly thirty-six hours, with only five hours of sleep. The rest was spent on physically and mentally exhausting things, not to mention several dangerous moments, so I felt extremely tired.

However, what I kept thinking about was Hetsumi's whereabouts. Number 04 gave me a draft of a Feng telegram record, which only had one piece of information about Hetsumi, and it was still sent from the Tianjin branch, so it was certainly not very important. The other telegrams that were worth paying attention to were about Song Zheyuan's attitude and Qin Decun's statement, and another was about Zhang Zizhong's actions.

Generally speaking, based on these telegrams, Song Zheyuan was acting alone, perhaps due to a lack of vision, or perhaps he had other intentions. The others, such as Qin Decun, Zhang Zizhong, Wang Lengqi, and Ji Xingwen, were consistent, but there was no obvious united action. This could only be attributed to Song Zheyuan's single-mindedness, dreaming of an illogical peace plan. "Unable to command, yet unwilling to obey," was probably a good commentary on his attitude.

Early the next morning, while I was still in bed, Number 04 came to ask for instructions, saying that Engineer Wu was eager to see me, and said that he had already come twice yesterday. It seemed that there was a rather serious problem that he also wanted to discuss with me. Since he was an old classmate from Beiping and we had a good relationship, I immediately went to the guest room to meet him.

"You're finally back, you've had me worried sick!" Engineer Wu's opening remark was such an alarming statement.

"Oh," I maintained a calm composure, momentarily unable to think of anything that would make him worry about me.

"Look," he continued with a worried face, as if blaming me for doing something wrong, "Someone like you, a lone wolf, of course doesn't matter; but I have my entire family, old and young, with their lives and property here, you have to think about me too!"

"What do you mean?" These two headless remarks left me utterly confused, "What's wrong?... Let's all think of a way."

"Look, it's becoming more and more peaceful, "When the sky falls, there's still the roof ridge to hold it up." I said, Old Brother, you have to give me an idea."

Engineer Wu was called Dingyuan. He finished middle school in Beiping, and later went to the University of Hong Kong, majoring in electrical engineering. He was quite handsome and smart, but unfortunately he lacked luck. After graduating from Hong Kong, he couldn't get a job as an engineer, so he had to work as a mathematics professor at a poor university in Beiping, just getting by. It was hard enough to get into the Pinghan Railway, working as a deputy engineer. I heard that it took a lot of effort and many connections to get this position. But then, he happened to encounter the most "depressed" situation, with corrupt officials flying everywhere, and the railway bureau being so poor that it couldn't afford coal, and not paying salaries for years.

### September 18th

— Shao Fu

The three characters "September 18th" are the most deeply imprinted in the minds of all Chinese people, even though that date is much earlier than January 28th, August 13th, and July 7th.

A song written by an anonymous author also helps us to constantly recall all the tragic events that happened on that day. The War of Resistance was won, and we, especially the 70 million compatriots in the three northeastern provinces, were overjoyed and almost delirious. Unfortunately, the old September 18th was not wiped away, but what is the situation in the Northeast today?

From September of last year, for a full year, what kind of life have our northeastern compatriots been living? Enemy expatriates and prisoners have not yet been completely repatriated. Who is taking advantage of the chaos to loot? Who is waiting for an opportunity to occupy the territory? We all know it very well.

I have northeastern friends, and frankly speaking, based on their character and behavior, I dare to say that the suffering of the Northeast will only be a short-term matter. Because they are all "resolute, clear about right and wrong, optimistic about the future, and believe in the government.

Some people compare the Northeast to the powder keg of the Far East. From a geographical point of view, its future position is indeed very important. The responsibility of the northeastern people is certainly heavy, and the government will not take it lightly. Our national defense line in the Northeast is not just a slogan; it is a mission that we need to complete in a down-to-earth manner.

Today, I would like to ask everyone to focus their attention on Changbai Mountain and the Yalu River!

### Pain After Pain - Our Northeast

The Northeast is the treasure house of Asia and the lifeline of China. Please look at her products and resources:

Soybeans - Production accounts for 65% of the world's total, and its value accounts for 23% of my country's total export value.

Forests - Approximately 250 million acres, accounting for one-quarter of the country's total.

Railways - Approximately 6,500 miles, accounting for more than half of the country's total.

Products - Gold, oil, and iron production account for more than half of the country's total, and coal accounts for two-fifths of the country's total production.

Cultivated land - More than 150 million acres of cultivated land and more than 390 million acres of arable land.

Immigration - The population density in the Northeast is 28 people per square mile on average. If agriculture is improved, it can accommodate more than 30 million immigrants.

Fifteen years ago today, the mad Japanese army invaded the city of Shenyang, Liaoning. Under the "non-resistance policy" at the time, our army retreated step by step. On November 18, within two months, the three northeastern provinces were completely under the tyrannical power of the Japanese army.

After years of hardship, it evolved into a full-scale war of resistance. Before victory was about to come, the "Cairo Conference" declaration held in late November of the thirtieth year determined that the sovereignty of the Northeast would be returned to our country. After Japan surrendered, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was signed on August 14 of the thirty-fourth year, which stated in Article 2: "The Soviet government recognizes the three eastern provinces as part of China, and reiterates and reiterates its recognition of China's full sovereignty in the three eastern provinces." The Northeast's re-entry into the embrace of the motherland has been confirmed, and the people of the country are looking forward to the government taking over the administrative power of the Northeast with joy. Unexpectedly, some people took advantage of the convenience of the advance of the national army into the Northeast to establish political power one after another. Therefore, the Northeast, which had just begun to show light, was once again covered by shadows, and the problems became more and more serious, complicated, and involved international relations, and no solution has been found to this day.

### Crying for the Northeast!

— Suo

Some people participate in the war today, enter the Northeast tomorrow, issue military tickets the day after tomorrow, and start taking things a few days later; after a few more days, they want to stay for a long time and create a fait accompli, but they see that the situation is not right, so they leave in dismay! However, on the occasion of leaving, they are generous and give the scraped-clean land to a "democratic"-looking warlord. Then he sits on the plateau, smoking his pipe, and watching the fire in the Northeast. This fire is still being appreciated today.

Today is again "September 18th." We thought about these things: we can only shed tears in our hearts!

### Bachelor Hu Zongnan - Nothing is Easy in the World, Nothing is Difficult in the World!

— You Fu

After twenty-two years of struggle, General Hu Zongnan is not only a famous and typical general, but also, among those who graduated from Whampoa, he is a unique and outstanding talent. Among the students from the first term and subsequent terms, almost no one can compare to him. (According to the first term, no one except Hu was a commanding officer or held the rank of general).

Hu is from Xiaofeng, Zhejiang. After studying at Nanjing Higher Normal School, he was angered by the darkness of domestic politics and determined to participate in the revolution, so he decided to apply to Whampoa.

How He Got into Whampoa

There is an interesting story about Hu's application to Whampoa back then; because Hu was physically weak and over thirty years old, the school repeatedly refused his application at first. Later, after his persistent pleas, he was allowed to register and participate in the examination; but because his grades were too poor, he failed. Hu was extremely distressed. He then personally met with Education Director General Wang Boling and requested permission to enroll. General Wang felt that his ambition was commendable, so he reluctantly broke the rules and allowed him to enroll.

Unexpectedly, Hu's talent was relatively poor. Most of his classmates were young people around the age of twenty, who were smarter than him, which Hu's middle-aged brain could not keep up with. As a result, Hu became the dumbest of all the students in the first term; not only was he dumb, but he was also very listless, often dozing off in class. As a result, the instructors and classmates all had headaches because of him, and unanimously believed that he was not worth training!

During the graduation exam, Hu was unable to cope. The instructor forgave his pain, so he gathered all the subjects together and gave Hu a question to answer. At that time, the instructor asked Hu: "What is the essence of what you have learned at Whampoa?" If he answered correctly, he would graduate; if he didn't answer correctly, he would not graduate. Hu immediately replied to the instructor: "Concentrate forces on the key points and develop them." The instructor was very satisfied that he had tactical thinking, so he allowed him to graduate; unexpectedly, later, Hu used this sentence in every battle, and thus achieved unlimited results. During the period of internal pacification, the Red Army was simply terrified at the sound of the three characters "Hu Zongnan," so as long as they encountered Hu Zongnan's First Division, the Communist army would immediately retreat. During the Communist Party's boasted propaganda of the 25,000-mile Long March, Hu Zongnan followed and pursued, leaving the Communist army with nowhere to go, and finally freezing to death in the snowy ice, and countless others being eaten by the Miao people in the border areas; even today, the Communist army admires General Hu's troop tactics. This may be due to his habitual use of that sentence from the graduation exam back then.

The Battle to Defend Wuhan

When the "August 13th" Incident broke out, Hu was once transferred to Shanghai. After the loss of Songhu, in the battle to defend Greater Wuhan, Hu commanded his troops to garrison Xinyang, preventing the enemy from crossing the line.

Later, he was transferred to Xi'an and took on the mission of defending the Great Northwest. For eight years, he has led hundreds of thousands of troops to sit in the Northwest, preventing the enemy from succeeding. The people of the Northwest call General Hu "the people's protector."

Hu not only guarded the Northwest, but also founded a military academy, namely the Seventh Branch School. He served as the director himself, training many junior cadres, so that the vast troops in the Northwest did not feel panicked about the lack of junior cadres.

He Doesn't Need a Wife

Although Hu's position is high today, he is still a bachelor; he doesn't seem to like getting close to women; many people have asked him about his marriage, and his answer is "My whole life is centered on my career." However, once, he went to Chongqing to attend a meeting of army group commanders and above. At that time, Madame Chiang was looking for a partner for Miss Kong Er without success, so she took a fancy to Hu and asked someone to explain her intention to Hu Zongnan, but Hu also politely declined! So, Hu still doesn't have a wife. This may be a factor in his rapid career development, but Hu is not distressed by this; on the contrary, he can focus on his career; throughout his life, General Hu has always insisted on one idea: "Dedicate himself to the country!"

Recalling his application to Whampoa and his student days, no one dared to believe that Hu Zongnan would have what he has today, and General Wang Boling, who has already died, did not dare to predict that at the time, but the facts prove that General Hu Zongnan is the leading general of Whampoa! This is: "People cannot be judged by their appearance, and the sea cannot be measured with a dipper," "Nothing is easy in the world, nothing is difficult in the world!" It just depends on how you do it!

Official: "Don't you have any relatives or friends?"

Criminal: "I have friends and relatives, but now that I'm poor, they all don't recognize me!"

Criminal: "Sir, stealing other people's things is against the law?"

Official: "Of course!"

Criminal: "Then, is suicide against the law?"

Official: "Suicide is also against the law! Assault!"

Criminal: "Then what about starving to death?"

Official: "Um...um... no" - End -

(Editor's note: Starving to death is innocent)

### Promoting Domestic Goods, Impersonating Foreign Goods

— Wang Wengu

Frenchman Daudet once said sadly in the last lesson: "Please don't forget the writing of your motherland, there will always be a day to turn around."

The enemy controlled us for eight years, and as a result, victory belongs to us. It must be said that this is because the enemy cannot control our souls - writing.

Some time ago, I saw in the newspaper: "The customs office's official documents will gradually be changed to Chinese." This means that the country has realized that we must respect our own writing.

However, at present, while we are promoting domestic goods, one hundred are actually genuine domestic cigarettes - Brandy, Beauty. Golden Dragon, Yuehua, Consul... It is not easy to find one or two Chinese characters on the price of cigarettes.

Absolutely domestic products - Three Sheep brand thermos bottles, ADK raincoats, Beweier hair oil, Fuller color shirts, it is not easy to find your own writing on the surface, if any, it is just a translation of foreign words.

On the one hand, we are promoting domestic goods, but on the other hand, we are asking the people to recognize: "BHK raincoats, MADE IN CHINA."

On the one hand, we are impersonating foreign goods, and on the other hand, we are telling people that they must love and use domestic goods. It really makes our group of consumers at a loss!

### Surplus Materials

— Yang Mou

Recently, the public and teaching staff of this city, favored by the Materials Supply Bureau, were given some food. It is said that this batch of food was transferred to our country from the surplus materials of the US military. The public and teaching staff are quite happy to have this blessing.

The things distributed this time include DK two kinds, each kind a total of nine servings, and they are divided into three meals: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Therefore, in other words. A total of three days of food was distributed, and the cost was a total of 9,000 yuan. The content of the food is quite rich, including cigarettes, biscuits, coffee, canned food, etc. Although it is rumored that there is mold, this batch of materials is from 1940, and the most recent is from 1945, so there are different situations. Generally speaking, it is still intact.

This batch of things is certainly not expensive. But three days of food costs 9,000 yuan, even if there is often this batch of cheap things available, a month will cost 90,000 yuan. If a family is only calculated with two people, it will cost 180,000 yuan, then there are countless public and teaching staff who cannot afford this treatment, and it cannot be said that the public and teaching staff eating this batch of surplus materials is "aiming too high."

The food that the US military does not want, and our public and teaching staff still feel that they "cannot afford" it, the distance between them is too far. And it is too unfair for our public and teaching staff.

However, thanks to the blessing of the US military, the public and teaching staff can finally taste a little cheap American flavor, isn't that a great stroke of luck?
