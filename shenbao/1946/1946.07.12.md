### The Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Has Been Repaired and Is Open to Traffic; Before the Chen Kaixuan Express Train Derailed; Suspicious People Were Seen Wandering Around

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 11th Dispatch] After the Kaixuan Express train derailed in Zhoujing Lane on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway on the 10th, the Railway Bureau sent personnel to repair it, and it was officially opened to traffic at 2:55 PM on the 11th. However, the sections of the Xin-Hu, Xin-Chang, and other local trains have been suspended. All shifts can resume as usual from the 12th.

[Our Newspaper News] The tracks of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway in Zhoujing Lane, Wuxi, have been repaired by personnel sent by the two railway bureaus after the second Kaixuan Express train derailed and was damaged on the 10th. All repairs were completed at 2:50 AM on the 11th. At 7:00 AM on the 11th, the Kaixuan Express train departed from Shanghai North Station as usual. The other regular passenger and freight trains also operated as usual, and everything has returned to normal. Hou Huahua, deputy director of the two railway bureaus, told reporters: The situation of this derailment and the degree of damage to the road surface are the only ones seen since the victory. When he received the accident report, he rushed to the scene of the accident by gasoline car to investigate. He discovered: (1) The steel rails were not broken; (2) The locomotive and passenger car wheel axles were not broken; (3) All locomotive and vehicle chassis were intact; (4) All fishplates on the tracks were not split. Based on the above points, it can be proved that this derailment was not due to technical negligence. According to other sources, the tracks at the scene of the Zhoujing Lane accident are straight lines. Even if the foundation is not solid due to heavy rain, at most the train will derail, and it will never overturn. Moreover, after investigation and inspection, there is no sign of roadbed collapse. Therefore, this incident was obviously caused by removing the rail spikes. Especially at 5:00 AM, a passenger train passed by and no accident occurred. Even if the speed is different, it will not lead to such a big accident. Therefore, the railway bureau is collecting information and stepping up investigation.

It is also learned that government senior officials on the Nanjing-Shanghai Road often take the Kaixuan Express train because it is fast and punctual. Therefore, this derailment incident was a planned sabotage by the Communist Party. It is said that on the eve of the accident, a group of suspicious people were seen wandering near the scene of the accident.

### The Pen of Victory

The One That Nimitz Signed the Instrument of Surrender With

To Be Preserved by the Central Museum

### Regarding the Accusations Against the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration: I Issue an Important Statement. Distribution of Relief Supplies is Based on Need, But Difficulties Naturally Arise Due to Transportation Damage.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Regarding the accusations against the Chinese government and the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), the Chinese government spokesperson issued the following statement today: It is recalled that in May of this year, the Director-General of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) was dissatisfied with the work of the UNRRA China Office. Consequently, the Director of the China Office, Mr. Casse, and the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Olmstead, were dismissed, and Mr. Lai was appointed as acting director. General Rooks, representative of Mr. LaGuardia, explained to the Chinese government that Mr. Lai's appointment was temporary and that a person of even greater prestige would be sought as the permanent director. Mr. Edison, former Governor of New Jersey, was also considered as a candidate. The Chinese government, recognizing the heavy responsibilities of this position, requested that the permanent director be appointed as soon as possible. The most noticeable impact of the personnel changes was a sudden reduction in the relief supplies distributed from Shanghai to the interior. Before the personnel changes, approximately 25,000 to 30,000 tons of supplies were distributed each week. The transportation of supplies to various locations was faster than the arrival of supplies in Shanghai. Subsequently, in a period of eight weeks, only 111,000 tons of supplies were distributed, averaging less than 15,000 tons per week. Within the second week of June, the amount shipped out of Shanghai dropped to as low as 3,500 tons. Currently, the amount shipped out is not as fast as the amount arriving in Shanghai. Accusers also claim that CRRRA did not fairly distribute UNRRA supplies to the Chinese Communist Party. CRRRA's distribution of supplies is overseen by Director-General Chiang Ting-fu, with UNRRA monitors assisting. Director-General Chiang is instructed by the Chinese government to distribute supplies fairly based on need. The Chinese government's policy for distributing relief supplies is based on need and has no other political considerations. However, difficulties naturally arise in implementing this policy due to transportation damage. As for the allegation that the government has not allocated the promised funds to CRRRA, I can state definitively that the original CRRRA budget was 450,000,000,000 yuan, and the government has already allocated it. Furthermore, because UNRRA supplies did not arrive on schedule and the amount of cotton shipped by UNRRA was less than originally planned, the Central Bank has lent CRRRA an additional 35,000,000,000 yuan in national currency. Due to congestion at the Shanghai docks, the time for transporting supplies to the interior has been delayed. UNRRA Director-General LaGuardia requested that the Chinese government send representatives to discuss reorganizing CRRRA with UNRRA representatives to create a more efficient implementing agency. The meeting was originally scheduled for last Thursday, but it was postponed to this Saturday because the UNRRA representative in China had not yet received authorization from Director-General LaGuardia. It is said that Mr. Lai (Director of the China Office) traveled to Peiping after his wedding, and the meeting will have to be postponed again. Director-General LaGuardia's suspension of some relief supplies to China initially gave the impression that this was a political action, but it was actually due to congestion in Shanghai ports. According to reports, fourteen ships have arrived outside the port, waiting for dock space. Director-General LaGuardia sent a telegram to Premier Soong, which was forwarded by Mr. Lai (Director of the China Office), which can clarify the truth. The telegram reads as follows: "Director-General LaGuardia instructs that, except for food, the shipment of relief supplies to China should be stopped immediately. Ships already en route are not subject to this restriction. The reason is that China has failed to distribute quickly. LaGuardia stated in a telegram to Chairman Chiang on June 7 that the continued shipment of essential food must be supervised and certified by the China Office." After receiving this, CRRRA immediately distributed it to the China Office's headquarters in the interior and to various districts, which will continue to make their best efforts to help CRRRA improve the distribution situation, so that supplies are distributed to the end consumer, so that existing items are cleared out and the UNRRA China Office has normal reasons in financial, transportation, and political areas to make recommendations. According to the original supply plan, we will continue to assist China. Our arduous work is just beginning. I believe that all my colleagues at UNRRA will overcome all difficulties, redouble their efforts, and complete this plan.

[United Press, Washington, 10th] The Chinese Embassy in the United States stated today that the report sent to Director-General LaGuardia by UNRRA China Office staff is clearly one-sided, and it is unwise to draw conclusions based on it. The obstruction of UNRRA relief supplies is affected by transportation difficulties. After a long period of resistance against Japan, it is normal for transportation in China to be difficult to recover for a time. After the Chinese authorities issue a detailed statement, the public will be able to gain a more accurate understanding of the situation.

### CRRRA Has Not Yet Received Official Notice. Director-General Chiang Will Host a Press Conference Today.

[Report from Our Newspaper] A spokesperson for CRRRA stated: "Since UNRRA announced the suspension of the shipment of certain relief supplies to China, it has attracted great attention from all parties. However, the agency has not yet received official notification. CRRRA's attitude will only be revealed at 3:00 PM today when Director-General Chiang hosts a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists at the Capital Hotel."

Chiang Has Already Expressed Three Points

However, Mr. Chiang has already expressed his views, stating briefly: (1) He deeply doubts whether LaGuardia has the authority to take this unilateral action without the UNRRA Council; (2) Some of the equipment received by CRRRA is not suitable for our country's needs, and the suspended supplies may refer to this equipment; (3) The percentage of supplies received by the Communist Party is not insignificant. The Communist areas do not lack food, and the Communist authorities have even expressed their willingness to exchange food from the Communist areas for the supplies they need, but UNRRA provides very few of these supplies, such as cloth, hand-cranked spinning wheels, and medical supplies. The Communist Party has received a considerable amount of medicine, and CRRRA has even purchased medicine in China specifically for their use; (4) Mr. Chiang declined to comment on the UNRRA staff's complaints to the Director-General, but pointed out that this incident occurred at a time when CRRRA was intensifying its relief efforts in the Communist areas, such as establishing an office in Yantai and intensifying relief efforts in the Yellow River disaster area in southern Shandong. CRRRA also sent 180 trucks specifically for transportation, but transportation is indeed extremely difficult, and some areas have no means of transportation at all; (5) Although there have been some obstacles to the transportation of supplies recently, most of the difficulties have been resolved after CRRRA's negotiations.

### A Major Bandit Den Was Broken Up in Hangzhou: More Than a Month of Diligent Investigation Leads to the Arrest of Fourteen Bandits

[Report from Our Newspaper in Hangzhou, 11th] Regarding the case of a civilian boat being robbed near Haiyue Bridge in Jianggan last month, resulting in the loss of 700,000 yuan in cash and a large amount of jewelry, as well as the kidnapping of hostages Yu Jiaju and Qian Xialin, the Provincial Capital Investigation Team, after receiving the report, dispatched a large number of officers to investigate extensively. After a week, on June 27, the team, together with the Hang County Investigation Team, discovered two people in the Guanyintang area of Xinqiao. After detailed questioning, they revealed information related to the case. After being taken to Hangzhou, the bandits, fearing exposure, released the hostages. Not long after, the gang of bandits made new plans, coming to Hangzhou in succession and hiding in various locations, including No. 13 Tai Miao Alley, Dadong Hotel on Dongpo Road, No. 35 Changguan Lane on University Road, and No. 2 Yilong, Qiafengli on Jiangjun Road, actively preparing to commit more crimes, totaling more than a dozen cases. After the team learned of this, they secretly discussed with Wu Rongzhao, the head of the Hang County Investigation Team, dispatching detectives to infiltrate the bandit den to gather information, and ordering their subordinates to closely monitor them and follow them individually. On the 28th of last month, the bandits again planned to rob the Shanghai-Hangzhou gasoline train and a certain bank in Hangzhou. Seeing that the time was ripe, the team mobilized all detectives and captured three bandits, Zhang Guicheng (alias Zhou Zhongchi), Yang Chunxian, and Tong Chunxi, by the West Lake and in tour boats. Then, they focused all their efforts on the remaining bandits' hiding places, hoping to wipe them out completely. At that time, it was learned that the bandit Zhao Yongcai was hiding in a certain unit in Tai Miao Alley. Because the team had limited manpower and no means of transportation, they contacted the police station in charge to send armed police officers to implement traffic control in the vicinity, while sending others to arrest the remaining criminals elsewhere. After midnight, the bandit Zhao sneaked out, intending to escape, and was caught by the police officers there, resulting in a fight. He eventually escaped, and the police officers, in their eagerness, fired shots in the direction of Chenghuang Mountain to pursue him. The bandit returned fire several times before fleeing up the mountain. After the investigation team learned of this, they dispatched police dogs to cooperate with some forces to search and arrest everywhere, and went directly to University Road where Zhao had hidden. When the detectives sneaked upstairs, they heard the sound of tiles on the roof. The detectives knew that something was wrong and surrounded the house while climbing onto the roof to pursue the bandit. The bandit ran anxiously on the roof, slipped, and was captured. At this time, the east was about to dawn, so they took swift action to arrest the bandits one by one under the guidance of the detectives, totaling fourteen male and female bandits, including Lu Bin, Xu Wenying, Yu Agui, Wang Hengxin, Li Junming, Liu Qiming, Tong Chunxi, Yang Chunxian, Zhang Guicheng, and Zhao Yongcai. It was found that this gang of bandits was numerous, powerful, well-organized, and ruthless. The victims were countless. The people of the city were overjoyed upon hearing the news. However, the remaining criminals have fled to Shanghai, and there is still a risk of more trouble.

### Wuhan Can Avoid Flooding

(Report from Our Newspaper in Hankou, 11th) The water level is only one meter away from the lowest point in Hankou City. Based on past trends, it could reach the highest water level in twenty years in less than a week. However, according to a telegram from Wanxian, Chongqing, the water level in Chongqing has dropped by two meters, and Wanxian has also dropped by one meter. Therefore, after Wuhan receives the floodwater that is still flowing in the Sha and Jianli areas, the water level is likely to drop. If the weather continues to be sunny, flooding may be avoided.

### Editorial: The Warmongers Have Reached the Point of Drawing Their Daggers!

These days, the overall situation in China feels like "a storm is brewing, the wind fills the tower!" The warmongers seem to have reached the stage of drawing their daggers. The appointment of Stuart as the new ambassador, while generally hoped to facilitate our negotiations, has been met with an unusually somber political atmosphere. The Five-Man Conference produced no results, and the Three-Man Conference is unlikely to convene. Following the CCP's "July 7th" declaration, the drums of the propaganda war are beating louder than before. The CCP's ten field army commanders have been appointed, and in addition to the army, there is also an air force commander. After "ascending the altar and conferring commands," the Communist army seems determined to launch a full-scale offensive.

Looking up, the situation is like the summer weather, with dark clouds gathering from all directions: In northern Jiangsu, the Communist army is besieging Liuhe and pressing Yangzhou, and the county seat of Haimen is also in imminent danger; in southern Tianjin, the Communist army has broken into Qing County, occupied Fenghuadian, and invaded Cang County; in central Shandong, the Communist army is attacking Gaotang, and Communist army commander Chen Yi has refused to meet with General Wang Yaowu, and is still attempting to land in Qingdao; between Henan and Hubei, the Communist army is attacking Yicheng, Xinye, Tangyin, and Wuling, and a force is attempting to cross into Laohekou. The Canton-Hankou train derailed between Changsha and Hengyang, and the early morning "Triumph" express train on the Peking-Shanghai Railway derailed and overturned later. Even Communist guerrillas are active in the Nanjing area, and once even approached Danyang. This shows that the Communist army's large-scale sabotage and harassment is becoming increasingly intense and pressing. It's as if the weather is extremely hot and humid, and a torrential downpour may come at any moment with a clap of thunder!

Such is the intent of the warmongers. No matter how much the government compromises and tolerates, it may not be able to satisfy their desires. No matter how fairly Special Envoy Marshall mediates, he may not gain their respect. In the minds of the warmongers, what do they care about the country or the nation? In the ten months since the victory, their attitude towards negotiations has been soft and hard at times, close and distant, seemingly continuous and then interrupted. Initially, they planned to be soft enough to avoid a resolution and hard enough to avoid a rupture. In short, they are intent on "dragging things out," dragging things out until they believe it is advantageous to themselves, and then drawing their daggers and engaging in a "full-scale martial performance" with pleasure.

They sing democracy in their mouths, but in fact, they are the least likely to believe in democracy. They sing peace in their mouths, but in fact, they are the least likely to enjoy peace. They sing unity in their mouths, but in fact, they are the least likely to want to see China unified. Under this premise of hypocrisy, the warmongers believe that the most advantageous way for them is to "fight" when they can fight, and "talk" when they can't fight temporarily. Thus, "talking and fighting" has become their secret, and it is this secret that has misled the country and harmed the people.

The rights and wrongs are clear. The common people only need to think: At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, the Communist army had only 45,000 people. In the thirty-third year, the Communist army requested to be reorganized into 16 divisions. When negotiations began last year, the Communist army requested to be reorganized into 16 armies, or 48 divisions, 16 times more than at the beginning, and now it is estimated to have 800,000 people. The area occupied by the Communist army was 74 counties before the Japanese surrender, and then occupied 241 counties by January 13 of this year. After the ceasefire order, it occupied another 22 counties, for a total of 337 counties. Just looking at these two facts, not to mention others, who is expanding their army and seizing land should be indisputable. The common people all hope to reduce the size of the military, and the Allied nations are also determined to assist us in reorganizing the military, but the warmongers are recruiting soldiers and buying horses. The common people all hope for national unity and peaceful construction, but the warmongers are fighting for cities and seizing land, killing people everywhere. This is clearly being hostile to the common people, clearly trying to disgrace the country, and weaken the country's international standing.

Why are these warmongers so unscrupulous in harming the country and the people? Because the CCP has two weapons it is using: one is "anti-American" propaganda that is coordinated with the international situation; and the other is the slogan of "anti-civil war" that deceives short-sighted people. With the weapon of "anti-American" propaganda, the CCP can scare its American allies, making them afraid to make a real judgment, so they can only appease the CCP's warmongers and not mention how to impose sanctions after mediation fails. With the weapon of "anti-American" propaganda, they can create a vague impression in the United States, with the help of "American communists," as if the Chinese people really want to "oppose America," so they can step up their advocacy of "American troops withdrawing from China," which will facilitate their future all-out war. With the slogan weapon of "anti-civil war," the CCP can hide behind the shield of "anti-civil war," only allowing them to shoot at the National Army, but not allowing the National Army to fight back. In other words, by using this slogan of "anti-civil war," the CCP can make the National Army disarm itself first, and then allow them to fight as they please. Clearly they are provoking and hitting people, but they first shout to the neighbors not to fight. This is truly an extremely clever tactic. For example, a robber breaks into a house, already holding a gun, but shouts to the neighbors to prevent the victim from shooting back in self-defense. How brilliant is this? There are even those who call themselves third parties, who ignore justice and fairness, and only know how to shout from the sidelines, "Don't shoot," but do not jointly stop the robbery. In such a strange situation, the CCP's warmongers will naturally be unscrupulous.

Some people who advocate anti-Americanism say that the United States seemed to be "adding fuel" and "putting out the fire" at the same time in the past, and in the future, they hope that the United States will only put out the fire and not add fuel. This statement sounds very pleasant on the surface. But putting out the fire also requires tools. Without cars, machines, belts, fire hoses, etc., putting out the fire is just empty talk. Mozi was extremely enthusiastic about non-aggression, but he sometimes had to help a country defend its city in order to achieve the goal of ending the war. Can we say that Mozi is adding fuel rather than putting out the fire when he uses tools to help defend the city? To be honest, today the CCP is intent on taking the offensive, but the government is only defending. If those who are putting out the fire cannot help those who are defending to stop the force of the attack, the fire cannot be put out. We are very ashamed that the fire in China still needs Americans to help put out! But we should be even more disgusted with those in China who are intent on setting fires! This newspaper has long reminded everyone to put out the sparks quickly, and now it is even later. Today, the overall situation in China is no longer a small spark, but has become a prairie fire. Put out the fire quickly, put out the fire quickly! Do not wait until everything is burned down!

The ancients said: "Throwing a rat, one must avoid breaking the utensils." Generally speaking, those who intentionally or unintentionally condoned the CCP, leading to today's prairie fire, are all holding the psychological disorder of "throwing a rat, one must avoid breaking the utensils." But today the rat is not thrown away, and the utensils are also on the verge of being destroyed. The time is critical! The warmongers have already reached the point of drawing their daggers. Do those who bear the heavy responsibility for the overall situation of the country still want to drag things out?

### Correspondences from Various Places: The Case of the Hang County Gang Extortion of Banks and Pawnshops Has Been Tried and a Date Has Been Set for Sentencing

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou Correspondent] The Hang County District Court held a hearing at 10:00 AM on the previous day to try the case of Mao Sikai, Chief of the Fourth Section of the Zhejiang Office of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Disposal Bureau, and Pan Shangyuan, an accountant in Hangzhou, who colluded to extort money from various banks and pawnshops under the puppet regime. The victims, Feng Xingchu, Manager of Detai Pawnshop, and Jiang Gaoquan, President of Jiangnan Commercial Bank, the witness, Accountant Zhou Lian, and the defendants in custody, Mao Sikai and Pan Shangyuan, were all present in court on time. Chief Judge Wang Tongqian explored the statements of the various parties in the case and the circumstances of the trial as follows. Feng Xingchu testified: "My testimony is largely the same as before, but I said that although I initially asked Accountant Zhou Lian to liquidate the assets, I was told by colleagues that it would be easier to settle the matter if I asked Accountant Pan Shangyuan to do so, so I changed to Accountant Pan. I paid a total of 2.5 million yuan in fees and 200,000 yuan in handling fees, but there were no receipts." Accountant Zhou Lian testified: "I did handle the liquidation for Detai and was responsible for stamping the final accounts reported to the Enemy and Puppet Bureau. As for how to quickly settle the matter later, I have not heard anything." Jiang Gaoquan testified: "I also said that I was extorted 2.1 million yuan in public fees, and I said that I saw Mao Sikai sitting in Pan Shangyuan's office, and I was quite flustered at the time." When Mao Sikai and Pan Shangyuan were questioned in court, Mao and Pan both denied it outright. Pan Shangyuan also pointed out that his office staff, Pan Yunzhong, witnessed someone named Zhou come to the office a few days before the incident (around May 25 or 26) and said that the purpose of the complaint was to overthrow the Enemy and Puppet Bureau, and that he had no choice but to involve you (referring to Pan) and felt deeply sorry. As for the collection of public fees, although it seemed excessive, there was no fixed amount, etc. Subsequently, the defense lawyers for the defendants Pan Shangyuan, Chen Zhongda and Jiang Shaotang, and the defense lawyers for Mao Sikai, Zhou Liang and Zheng Zhen, stood up one after another to argue the defense. The court ordered: "Although there is no direct evidence in this case, the statements of the complainants are all based on evidence, and it can be known that they are not fabricated to add to the crime. The sentence will be pronounced on the 15th." Pan Shangyuan's request to be released on bail was denied.

### Five Foreign Ministers Receive Formal Notification: China is a Convening Nation for the European Peace Conference, with the Five Powers Rotating as Chair

[Central News Agency, Paris, 10th Dispatch] The French Foreign Ministry today notified Mr. Qian Tai, our ambassador, that the four foreign ministers decided on the 9th that the chairmanship of the peace conference will be rotated among the foreign ministers of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France. (Note: Originally, Soviet Commissioner Molotov wanted to reject China as an invited nation to the peace conference. However, after our government argued with reason, coupled with pressure from international opinion, he abandoned his stubborn attitude. This was seen in yesterday's London broadcast report.)

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] This morning, French Ambassador Mérieux visited Minister Wang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the French Foreign Minister's notification. The notification stated that the Paris Peace Conference was being convened in the name of the foreign ministers' conference, and therefore the conference must be convened in the name of the full meeting of the five foreign ministers. Minister Wang agreed to reply after reporting to the government.

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 11th Broadcast: After Soviet Foreign Minister Inolotov published the Blue Book on German policy, the four foreign ministers held another meeting at 4 PM today to discuss it. It is expected to be resolved satisfactorily. The four foreign ministers' meeting will end this weekend. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov are scheduled to leave here and return to their countries on Saturday.

Inolotov Often Speaks to Clarify German Policy

[French News Agency, Paris, 10th Dispatch] The four foreign ministers' conference continued to meet, and expressed their opinions on the German question. French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bidault said that the four powers must reach an agreement on completely disarming Germany, eliminating Nazism, promoting democracy, and compensating for war damages. In addition, it is necessary to increase German coal production and delineate the western border of Germany. Regarding the border issue, France's attitude has not changed. Regarding the economic unification of Germany, although France temporarily agrees, France's original attitude regarding the separation of certain regions of Germany remains unchanged.

British Foreign Secretary Bevin said that it is necessary to eradicate Nazi ideology and Prussian militarism. The 25-year plan proposed by the United States is sufficient to achieve the above goals and can be accepted. Bevin also said that although long-term occupation of Germany is necessary, it is unacceptable for the four occupation zones to be isolated from each other and not communicate.

U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes said that the representatives of the countries seemed to have unanimously agreed on the economic unification of Germany, which was a principle decided a year ago, but today's Germany is still divided into four occupation zones, which is going in the opposite direction. He proposed the establishment of a special committee to be responsible for studying the German problem. Regarding this point, the representatives of the United Kingdom and France expressed their agreement, while Molotov requested that it be considered at length.

Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov said that France's desire to increase German coal production is acceptable, the organization of the occupation zones of the countries must be improved, and the disarmament of Germany must be thoroughly implemented, which can also be agreed to. However, it is inappropriate to economically destroy Germany or make it an agricultural country, which would threaten the entire world economy. Germany without the Ruhr area cannot become an independent country. Politically, Germany should not become a federal state, and no part of its territory can be divided without the consent of the German people. In this way, the Ruhr area can be jointly managed internationally, but it cannot be separated from Germany.

[French News Agency, Paris, 10th Dispatch] Molotov delivered a lengthy speech at today's four foreign ministers' meeting, clarifying his policy towards Germany. He declared that the Soviet Union cannot agree to any destruction of the entire German or making Germany an agricultural nation. Molotov said, "The time has come for us to discuss the fate of Germany and the treaty with Germany. The Soviet government has always believed that it is unwise to think of revenge when dealing with such issues. Although the German people cannot shirk their responsibility for Germany's aggression, it is also a fact that Hitler's Germany and the German people cannot be considered as one. The German army invaded the Soviet border, and the Soviet people suffered great misfortune. Our losses are incalculable. Other people in Europe and people in Africa also suffered great losses and pain due to Germany's aggression. Based on this, the question of Germany's fate is not only a concern for the German people, but also for the people of all countries who hope to prevent any future German aggression. The reason is obvious. At the same time, we must not forget that Germany once used its industrial strength to form an important part of the international economic system, but on the other hand, people must not forget that it was this industrial strength that made it possible for Germany to launch aggression. All this is true. At this moment, I begin to assume a theory, that is, from the point of view of European international economy and order, to carry out the annihilation of Germany, so that it will no longer become a country, and to turn Germany into an agricultural country by destroying its industrial center. All this is not right. This action will damage the European economy and disintegrate the international economy. Germany will therefore face political dangers, such as the gradual spread of human diseases, which will eventually become a threat to peace and security. I believe that even if we adopt this policy, history will force us to abandon it in the future, because this policy is not practical and its position is not correct. Therefore, in my opinion, our task is not to eliminate Germany, but to make it a peaceful and democratic country, but to deprive it of all economic and military possibilities, so as not to raise a tiger and cause trouble again and become a country of aggression."

### The Soviet Union Takes Over German Property in Austria: The United Kingdom and the United States Jointly Protest, Using Two Documents to Negotiate with the Soviet Union

[Reuters, London, 10th] The British Foreign Ministry stated today that the United Kingdom and General Clark of the United States have filed a joint protest against the Soviet Union's plan to take over German property in Austria. This is only an initial response. The British side will not limit itself to just filing a protest. Whether to take further action in Vienna or wait for the four foreign ministers' conference to discuss the Austrian issue before deciding on measures has not yet been determined. But it is expected that Bevin will directly mention this to Molotov today. The United Kingdom will now cite two documents, one is the London Declaration signed on January 6, 1943, by the sixteen warring nations, which stipulates that the Allied countries, including the Soviet Union, cannot recognize the transfer of property in the German-occupied territories as valid. The second is the Moscow Declaration of November 1, 1943, which does not recognize the German-Austrian merger and reaffirms the intention of the three countries to promote Austria's independence and reconstruction, and then negotiate with the Soviet Union.

Axon's Statement

[United Press, Washington, 10th] Acting U.S. Secretary of State Axon declared today that the United States finds it difficult to recognize the Soviet Union's removal of so-called German assets from Austria, unless such actions are in line with U.S. policy. Whether the removal is legal is judged by whether it is a "forced transfer." The so-called "forced transfer" means that the original Austrian industry was forcibly seized by Germany. This industry should still be regarded as Austrian assets and cannot be regarded as German assets, and therefore cannot be confiscated. It is reported that industrial equipment in eastern Austria worth 22 million U.S. dollars, together with other "foreign German assets" in the Soviet military occupation zone, have been taken over by the Soviet army.

Austrian Authorities Express

[United Press, Vienna, 10th] Austrian Prime Minister Figl declared at a special meeting of Parliament today that the Soviet Union and other occupying countries only have the right to demand the confiscation of German property in Austria that was legally obtained before the German annexation of Austria in 1938. According to Figl, the Austrian government refuses to recognize as German property any property obtained by Germans after 1938 through political pressure. After Figl finished speaking, the entire parliament applauded.

Germans Do Not Retreat

[Reuters, Vienna, 10th] It is heard from reliable sources that after the protests from the United Kingdom and the United States, the Soviet authorities have agreed to "postpone until after the holidays" the evacuation of Germans in the Soviet military zone of Austria. The meaning of the word "holidays" is still unclear. The temporary settlement for German nationals in the Soviet zone of Vienna has been disbanded.

### The Soviet-Turkish Issue of Security Is Not Resolved, Turkish Troops Demobilize

[Reuters, Istanbul, 10th] The Turkish official agency "Bird's Post" hinted that the Turkish army will only demobilize the wartime troop levels that were slightly micro-operated at the beginning of the European War after a precise resolution of Soviet-Turkish relations. The newspaper's editorial stated that "We are forced to leave this preparation to defend everyone's freedom. What the Turkish nation and government are uneasy about is the unresolved territorial issues of the Crimean Tatars and the provinces of Kars and Ardahan, which were raised by the Soviet Union. The external threat still exists and cannot be immediately demobilized, which once caused the Balkan countries to attack Turkey."

### The Iraqi Kingdom Requests to Participate in the Paris Peace Conference

[United Press, Iraqi Capital, 10th] The Iraqi Foreign Ministry today sent notes to the British Ambassador, Mr. Long, and the U.S. and Soviet legations, seeking permission for Iraq to participate in the Paris Peace Conference.

### Strange Light in Swedish Sky

[Reuters, Swedish Capital, 10th] A light resembling a meteor was discovered in the sky over Sweden, causing great surprise among the residents.

### The Dutch Government Will Send a Delegation to Participate in the Java Negotiations to Seek a Peaceful Solution

[Reuters, The Hague, 10th] Dutch Prime Minister Beel recently revealed to the Lower House that the Dutch government will send a delegation to Java to participate in the negotiations between Van Mook and Indonesia. The purpose of the negotiations is to seek a peaceful solution to the Indonesian conflict and to encourage the Indonesian people to participate in the conference to be held in The Hague.

Shahrir, Prime Minister, Also Serves as Foreign Minister

[Reuters, Batavia, 10th] Shahrir, the Indonesian question, announced that he has been appointed as the new cabinet's foreign minister. Shahrir continued, "The military operations in the interior of Java are proceeding smoothly, with the purpose of eliminating revolutionary elements and creating a better environment for organizing the new cabinet."

All Conspirators Eliminated

The conspiracy launched last week by the radicals in Yogyakarta, "somewhat like a Mexican coup," when I arrived at President Sukarno's residence, one of the conspiracy leaders was reading an ultimatum to Sukarno, demanding the establishment of a "political bureau" with authority higher than the cabinet. At that time, the conspirators were disarmed and arrested by the president's guards. A special court will now be established to try them as state criminals.

### The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission's Rules of Procedure are Passed: The Canadian Representative is Allowed to Participate in the Discussion, and the Soviet Representative Fails to Use the Veto Again

[U.S. News Agency, New York, 10th] The United Nations Security Council unanimously passed the rules of procedure drafted by the Atomic Energy Commission today, so that the commission can follow them when discussing the atomic energy control plan. The Security Council held a heated debate on the issue of the Canadian representative's attendance, and as a result, the Canadian representative was allowed to participate with nine votes in favor and one vote against. The Soviet Union voted against. Canada is not a normal member of the council, but since Canada is a member of the Atomic Energy Commission, it specifically requested to be allowed to participate in the discussion of the atomic energy issue. Soviet Representative Gromyko opposed Canada's request, arguing that this was a new step and advocating a vote. The British and Australian representatives believed that Canada's request was extremely reasonable, because any country, if what is being discussed involves that country, can participate in the council's discussion without going through voting procedures. Regarding this point, the United Nations Charter has clear provisions. At this point, Chairman Najjari (the representative of Mexico) adopted a voting method to decide, and obtained a result of nine votes in favor and one vote against. Poland did not participate in the vote. As a result, the Soviet representative attempted to use the veto power, but was rejected by the chairman. Najjari pointed out that this issue was "procedural" and not "substantive," and the veto power could not be used. Therefore, the Canadian representative continued to sit calmly in his seat, and then the meeting adjourned, scheduled to reconvene on the 17th, with Dutch Representative Kleffens taking over as chairman.

### Brandi's Prediction

Atomic Energy Underwater Explosion Will Stir Up Huge Water Columns

[United Press, Outside Bikini Island, 10th] General Brandi, the commander-in-chief of the atomic energy test, said today that the fragments of the target ship that were shattered by the second atomic energy underwater explosion test held on July 15 could rise as high as a mile in the air. The explosion in the Bikini Lagoon will cause a huge water column to surge out. We believe that a water column with a diameter of 2,000 to 2,500 feet will surge out from the surface of the lagoon to a height of 8,000 to 10,000 feet.

### Nehru's Speech

[Reuters, Bombay, 10th] Nehru, the new president of the Indian National Congress, delivered a speech at an open-air gathering of 200,000 people here today, saying: "If the Congress Party does not obtain the right to formulate a constitution for India that is completely free and sovereign, then the Indians will prepare to fight for freedom from the British under cannonballs and bayonets. The constitution should be formulated by a constitutional convention." Nehru also urged the people that if there is no other way, they should prepare to unite and fight. "We will establish a free India, and racial discrimination will not be allowed to exist. White people can be allowed to reside in India, but they need to respect the Indian people."

[Reuters, London, 10th] After the members of President Truman's cabinet committee flew here from Washington today, the Palestine issue negotiations will begin to enter an important stage. The outcome of this meeting will depend entirely on the fate of the British-American allocation report.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 11th] The Palestinian Arab Higher Council recently complained to the High Commissioner, pointing out that Jewish villages are directly related to the smuggling of military supplies, illegal immigration, and Jewish terrorist activities, and therefore demanded the immediate dissolution of the Jewish Association. It should not be recognized as a cooperative institution for dealing with Palestinian affairs in cooperation with the mandatory government.

[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 11th] In 1935, the Japanese Kwantung Army actively arranged the work of invading North China. The propaganda plan drawn up by the Kwantung Army at that time was submitted to the International Tribunal yesterday. This plan is found in the report of Kwantung Army Chief of Staff Toshiro Nishio to Japanese Army Vice Minister Ganro Koso on December 9, 1935. It stated that the Kwantung Army's propaganda plan for North China was to make China and foreign countries understand that it was legitimate when the Kwantung Army entered the customs, and to stimulate the North Chinese people's anti-Kuomintang and anti-communist consciousness, and to arouse the anti-war emotions of the Chinese military and civilians in various places. The main propaganda points first falsely claimed that North China was a colony of the National Government, and that the North Chinese people were eager to break away from its shackles and establish an autonomous government. It also happened that the National Government nationalized silver, which aroused resentment among the North Chinese people, and the movement to establish an autonomous government was able to develop rapidly. It also claimed that the National Government had undermined the North China Truce Agreement, aroused anti-Japanese sentiment, disturbed "Manchukuo," and threatened Japanese interests and the lives of Japanese expatriates in North China. Therefore, it was necessary to seek understanding from China and foreign countries that Japan would resort to force when it was unavoidable.

[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] Brigadier General Claymore was appointed today as the American judge of the International Tribunal to replace Higgins. Mr. Higgins is scheduled to leave here to return to the United States tomorrow. Mr. Claymore is expected to arrive here on Monday.

### Old Fox Chang Yuqing, Spouting Nonsense with a Terrible Attitude, Refusing to Tell the Truth About His Evil Deeds

He stubbornly denied the crimes he committed and flatly refused to admit them. He continued to play deaf and dumb during the retrial yesterday afternoon, denying that he was the head of the "Huangdao Society" and denying any involvement in murder. When an official was sent to inform him that all newspapers in the 27th year of the Republic had reported it, Chang cunningly argued that he had offended the press in the 16th year of the Republic when Mei Lanfang performed and he did not entertain them properly. Therefore, the news media harbored hatred towards him. He claimed that news reporters had no material and that was why they came after him. He also claimed that he was a devout Buddhist who did not know a single letter. From the first year of the Republic to the present, he has not touched alcohol or tobacco, nor even killed a chicken. How could he possibly kill people? He had no grudges against them, and he was not insane, so why would he want to kill them? Killing and arson require concrete evidence, and people should be brought to court to testify. Newspaper reports are unreliable because newspapers once said that he was dead. But he is still alive. He asked the judge: "Are you trying to force me to admit to murder? Was I an official or did I become rich at the time?" Because Chang stubbornly denied the charges, the judge was helpless. After repeated questioning, Chang vaguely stated that the "Huangdao Society" was led by Chen Qun, and the head was a Japanese man named Takahashi. However, he still refused to reveal the number of his followers, the fabrication of terrorist incidents, etc. Finally, the court brought Huang Fusen, a former Chinese detective from the Public Concession Police Department who had been sentenced to two and a half years in prison, from prison to testify. Huang stated that many of the terrorist cases in the concession in the 27th year of the Republic were committed by the "Huangdao Society," but he said that he had only heard rumors about whether Chang Yuqing was the head, and he did not know the actual situation. The case still needs to be investigated in court, so the court adjourned it for another hearing.

### Cai Pei Re-Tried, Claims Serving in Puppet Positions Was to Save the People

Cai Pei, who once served as a puppet ambassador to Japan and the puppet mayor of Nanjing, was retried in the High Court yesterday. Cai argued that all newspapers and publications at the time were controlled by the enemy and puppet regime. It was common for them to arbitrarily add or subtract content under false names. The propaganda department of the puppet regime was accustomed to writing articles under false names. In the harsh environment at the time, it was impossible to make corrections. "One cannot keep one's name in one's pocket and prevent others from using it; please, Your Honor, understand this." During his tenure as the mayor of Nanjing, he negotiated with the Japanese troops stationed at Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to withdraw, subsequently reorganized the area, and organized a guard to protect it. Throughout history, those who protect the mausoleum have performed great service, and this was his greatest act of loyalty to the Premier. While holding puppet positions, he contacted Xu Mingcheng, a special commissioner of the Southeast District of the Central Military Affairs Department, and provided intelligence. He also rescued arrested underground workers, including Ma Yuanfang, director of the Nanjing Municipal Party Committee; Yu Hong, head of the General Affairs Section of the Shanghai Branch of the Youth League; and Wang Wenjun, a comrade from the Accounting Office of the Second Guerrilla Zone Command of the Third War Area. He insisted that he took the puppet positions because of the harsh environment and did so without seeking fame or fortune but to save the people and asked the court for forgiveness. Deng Jiecun, Yu Pangrong, Wang Wenjun, and others appeared in court to provide favorable testimony. Cai also hired lawyer Yu Cunxiu to defend him. The case was said to have concluded its debate and is scheduled to be pronounced on the morning of the 18th at 9:30 AM.

### Sentences Handed Down to Three Traitors, Liang Shi Sentenced to Two Years and Six Months

The High Court pronounced sentences in several treason cases yesterday: (1) Liang Shi, chief writer for the puppet China Daily, was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for two years. (2) Chu Lingsun, president of the Jiangsu Provincial Hospital under the puppet regime, was sentenced to one year and three months of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for two years. (3) Yu Peng, a police officer in the Suzhou Police Bureau under the puppet regime, was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for two years. All property of the convicts was confiscated, except for a reasonable amount to cover the necessary living expenses of their families.

Furthermore, the cases of Zhang Guanfu and Xu Jinqing, who were suspected of being traitors, were found to lack conclusive evidence of collaboration with the enemy. However, they were found to have violated ordinary laws, so the court announced yesterday that jurisdiction in the matter was erroneous and the case would be transferred to the local court.

### Two Murderers of Patriots, Russian Secret Agents Tried Yesterday

The Tao brothers, Russians, served as secret agents for No. 76 during the enemy-puppet period. In July of the 29th year of the Republic, they led the Second Brigade of Special Agents to capture Chen Sancai, a patriotic youth, and sent him to Nanjing, where he was soon killed. During the trial in the High Court yesterday, Chen's comrade Tang Huiyu appeared in court to testify unequivocally. He stated that the two Russians were involved in terrorist incidents such as the machine-gun shooting at the Great America Evening News and the bombing of the Farmers' Bank. However, the defendants both flatly denied the charges. The case was adjourned for another hearing.

On the same day, the cases of Ye Yaoguang, chief of the Document Section of the Puppet Special Agents Headquarters, Zhou Wenrui, director of the Puppet Inland River Steamship Company, and Shen Xiaoyan, a cultural traitor, were also heard. After investigation, all were adjourned for another hearing.

After extracting a confession through torture, they sent him to the 13th Army Military Law Conference, where he was executed. After the victory, Zhao Yuee, the victim's wife, reported the case to the Third Theater of Operations, which arrested the defendants. Yesterday morning, Zhang Shishan, who was arrested at the same time as Lu Xiangsheng and later released, appeared in court to testify that he had indeed been beaten by Maruyama Masato. However, both defendants denied the charges. The court ordered that the case still needs to be investigated for evidence and adjourned for another hearing.

The meeting was chaired by Mrs. Yang Aifang, the wife of President Ling Xianyang, who reported on the motive for convening the meeting: (1) Due to the disruption of transportation since the Anti-Japanese War, there was a loss of contact between the various associations, so this opportunity was used to allow the association and the city associations to exchange opinions, review the past, and plan for the future.

Afterwards, the participants collectively participated in spiritual practice, and Mayor Wu's wife read a verse from the Bible.

On the 20th, they began to transport materials from warehouses and factories, such as valuables and machinery, northward overnight. This lasted for three months, and the total losses cannot be counted. The situation was even worse than during the occupation period. At the same time, more than 2,000 women in Changchun and Shenyang were defiled, so local women did not dare to go out. When the communist troops entered Shenyang, they wore headscarves and gray old cotton-padded jackets, and were tattered and unbearable. However, three days later, they were all in new clothes and neatly dressed.

The investigation is proceeding actively, but it may not be possible to solve the case in the short term. The reporter asked: "In your opinion, are these counterfeit dollars made by Chinese or foreigners?" Mr. Bu Luojin laughed repeatedly and replied: "Foreigners! Foreigners! I think the Chinese are still far from making such exquisite products."

### Conflict on the Bus, A Terrible Brawl, Streetcars in Yangshupu All Stopped Last Night

[Report from this newspaper] A B79 streetcar on the No. 8 route from the Bund to Yangshupu was traveling on Broadway Road at approximately 6:00 PM last night when Zhou Yingqian, Yang Shiqing, and Chen Mingzhou, three mechanics from the 25th Motor Vehicle Squadron of the Aviation Committee, got into a dispute with Ni Yubiao, the ticket seller of the B2347 car, over ticket purchase. The conflict escalated into a fight, and the car stopped. Before long, more than twenty streetcars were blocked there. All the drivers and ticket sellers stopped their cars and joined the fight, and other soldiers from the army and navy on the car also participated. As a result, several people on both sides were injured. The Hudong Military Police arrived and made every effort to suppress the disturbance and bring it to an end. At approximately 7:00 PM, the vehicles stopped at that location were all driven back to the Yangshupu car factory and had not been dispatched by late evening. At the time of the incident, a soldier named Yang Shukai from the Aviation Committee's equipment warehouse was seriously injured in the ribs and was sent to Public Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the Aviation Committee believes that the soldier was not a passenger on the bus and was seriously injured for no reason. They will report the facts to the Garrison Command and other relevant agencies and intend to file a lawsuit. On the other hand, after the ticket sellers and drivers of the streetcar company drove the car back to the factory, they held an emergency meeting to request the company to provide them with protection. Wu, chief secretary of the Resources Committee,

### Director Wu, Chief Secretary of the National Resources Commission, Inspects Various Institutions in Shanghai; Discusses in Detail the Establishment of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation; Hopes Sugar Merchants Cooperate to Stabilize Market Prices

Mr. Wu Zhaohong, Chief Secretary of the National Resources Commission of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, arrived in Shanghai from the capital two days ago to inspect the affiliated institutions in Shanghai and investigate market conditions for reporting to the central government. A reporter from the Central News Agency noted the recent rise in sugar prices, which has attracted general attention and led to criticism of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's handling of affairs. As the corporation is directly under the National Resources Commission, the reporter specifically sought Mr. Wu's opinion on matters related to Taiwan Sugar. Mr. Wu provided the following information: "The National Resources Commission has always valued the interests of the people in managing state-owned industrial and mining enterprises. It also adopts an attitude of assistance toward similar enterprises run by private individuals, so that state-owned and private enterprises can work hand in hand to promote the overall industrial development of the country. Taiwan's sugar industry has been developed by the Japanese for decades and is quite large in scale, including not only sugar factories but also more than 2,000 kilometers of factory-built railways and a large amount of sugarcane land. However,

during the war, it suffered heavy damage from Allied air raids. Therefore, restoring and managing this enterprise is indeed an arduous task. In April of this year, we were ordered by the Executive Yuan to take over the operation, and with approval, we co-operated with the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office. Because a small number of Taiwanese compatriots had invested in the original enterprise, a joint-stock company was organized. Before the war, there were very few sugar factories in China, and most of the sugar was imported from overseas, costing a considerable amount of foreign exchange each year. Therefore, the most important goal of the sugar company is to restore past production levels in order to meet domestic needs. Therefore, after taking over in May of this year, we immediately began to renovate the factory buildings and equipment, and hired American sugar manufacturing experts to conduct on-site inspections, together with our technical personnel, to develop

a restoration plan. The initial report from the American side has already been submitted, and a large amount of equipment needs to be supplemented from abroad in order to gradually restore the old appearance. In addition, the raw materials in each factory include stored sugar, which the company was ordered by the Executive Yuan to sell. The sale price of this sugar is in accordance with the regulations for dealing with enemy and puppet property. The company remits all proceeds to the national treasury, except for a small amount of miscellaneous expenses. As for the company's sugar sales policy, it was determined by the National Resources Commission at the beginning that, in addition to direct sales to large users, it only engages in wholesale

business, not retail. At a time when various commodity prices are soaring, the National Resources Commission has also paid attention to curbing prices from the beginning. Therefore, it is stipulated that the company's wholesale price must be lower than the market price. Since the company began selling sugar on May 24, each sale price has been lower than the market price, as can be verified by newspaper records. However, if the market price is

pushed up by the market to be much higher than the wholesale price, the company naturally has no reason to sell at the original price. The National Resources Commission's operation of enterprises is not originally for the purpose of making profits, but if the company continues to sell at the original price, on the one hand, the government reduces its income and suffers unnecessary losses, and on the other hand, it does not benefit the general public, but only allows a small number of merchants to obtain excessive profits. Therefore, the Commission instructed the sugar company that future pricing should still maintain a policy of being lower than the market price, and the legitimate interests of legitimate sugar merchants should naturally be protected. It is sincerely hoped that sugar merchants can also take the position of caring for the domestic sugar industry, stabilize market prices, and benefit the general public."

In addition, Mr. Wu personally went to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation yesterday to inspect the company's recent business conditions and distribution process, inquiring in great detail. Later, he and Mr. Shen Zhennan, the general manager of the company who returned to Shanghai from Taiwan the day before, and Associate Manager Song Yishou visited Mayor Wu to discuss how to curb the rising sugar prices in the future, improve distribution, and popularize it to users, and eliminate the manipulation of illegal merchants. Mr. Wu and Mr. Shen took the night train back to the capital last night. He may come to Shanghai again in two weeks.

### News Figure in the Peking Opera Circle, Ma Lianliang's "Explanation"; Denies Being Sent to the Northeast to Perform for Celebrations; Expresses Doubt About the Court's Arrest Warrant and House Sealing

[Reported by this newspaper] At 9:30 PM, I went to visit Ma Lianliang backstage at the Queen's Grand Theater, and was told that "Master Ma has not yet arrived." At 10:30 PM, I was told that "Master Ma is on stage." The entrance was heavily guarded, and reporters were not allowed in at first, but I was finally let in. Ma Lianliang, dressed in his costume, said to the reporter behind the scenery: "Please wait for me at the Queen's Cafe, and I will come as soon as I get off stage."

At 11:30 PM, I formally met this news figure who has recently caused a sensation in Shanghai, a famous actor, in the Queen's Cafe upstairs. All the newspapers have reported that Ma Lianliang was accused of being a traitor and that the Beiping Higher Court had issued an arrest warrant. Now he is the center of conversation for the general public, but he is still singing charity performances with composure.

"I hope that my friends in the press can understand my situation and give me a fair criticism," Ma Lianliang said very modestly. "I am not saying that I have been wronged, but I want to explain my past performances in Manchukuo."

He focused his energy on this "explanation." He said a lot, and according to his meaning, his trip to Manchukuo to perform was still a righteous act. Ma Lianliang is a Muslim, and the Northeast Islamic Middle School, established by the Islamic Association in Shenyang, was short of funds and invited Ma to perform several charity concerts to raise money. "But the main point is not this," Ma Lianliang said urgently, "There was an performing arts association organized by Japanese rogues such as Itoshima in Manchukuo, and they used this organization to control the performing arts circles in Northeast China. One of the Chinese people worked as their translator, and it is said that this person was Zhu Fuchang, the editor of the Beiping 369 Pictorial. Song, representing the performing arts association, contacted me and said that they would take me to Shenyang to perform, and they would also handle the matter of the Islamic Association inviting me to perform. The organization of the performing arts association was mainly for money, and they used the special power of the Japanese to "protect" the artists who went to the Northeast, taking profits from our salaries. Zhu Fuchang also threatened me with death, and as a result," Master Ma sighed, "I went."

As a result, he went. He performed charity performances in Shenyang for the Islamic Association for twelve days, and then he performed commercial performances for more than twenty days. These twenty days were performed for the "performing arts association" to make profits. Ma Lianliang spoke very pitifully, as if his performances in the Northeast were completely involuntary. At this time, he also brought up some old events, talking about how he pretended to be crazy to escape performing when the puppet government of Eastern Hebei was established before the War of Resistance, and also said that he organized the celebration performances to welcome Chairman Chiang and various officials after the victory. Was he trying to show some merit? Can a truly traitorous person (assuming he is) be exonerated by these merits?

Finally, the reporter asked him the most important question: What do you think about the fact that the Beiping Higher Court has issued an arrest warrant for you this time?

"I have nothing to say," he said excitedly, "But I don't believe that the news is correct. They said they were going to arrest me, but I have not received any official documents to this day. They said that my house in Beiping has been sealed up, but I have not received a telegram from home to this day. I don't know anything, so I still sing charity performances with peace of mind. If there is an order from above to take me, I will definitely go."

He also said: "I want to make a special statement that I did not go to the Northeast to perform for the puppet government to celebrate their so-called tenth anniversary of the founding of the country. I just happened to catch up. If it was really sent by the puppet government, then the puppet government has a record to check, and I will never shirk responsibility."

He spoke very firmly, as if he were completely innocent, but what is ultimately right or wrong is not the reporter's business. It was late at night when I parted with him. How many people in this quiet night are thinking about the good and evil they have done during the day!

### Impersonation and Extortion; Arrested After Failure

[Reported by this newspaper] Qian Xu, a local woman residing at No. 44 Chunggeng Li, Zhongzheng East Road, has a habit of smoking opium, but has not registered with the authorities. The rogue Shi Guoping, along with Hui Shigen, learned of this and conspired with Kang Maodi to extort money. They colluded with Jin Xinzhou and Zong Ziying, two members of a certain agency, and went to Qian Xu's home in Chunggeng Li on the evening of the 7th, claiming to be searching for opium and extorted one million yuan. However, because she did not have much cash, she took out 440,000 yuan as a bribe. During the negotiations, Shi Guoping was unsatisfied with his desires and went to the home of Lu Jilun on the third floor of the same building and seized the opportunity to extort six gold rings and a copper pocket watch. As they were about to escape with the loot, the nearby patrol police officer No. 2010 noticed the flaw and secretly reported it to the Huangpu Branch.

### Overview of Secondary Education in Xikang; Twenty-Three Secondary Schools in Five Districts of the Province

[Special Report from Xichang by this newspaper] Xikang is located on the border, and its culture is isolated. Since the establishment of the province in 1938, the attention of the rulers has been aroused, and the establishment of secondary schools has sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Originally, the province was divided into four secondary school districts, but now it is divided into five secondary school districts, with at least one provincial secondary school and one county secondary school established in each district. The situation of the secondary schools in each district is briefly recorded below:

The first district includes the twenty-one counties and bureaus of the old Kang area. In this district, there are currently Kangding Provincial High School, Luding High School, and two Luding County junior high schools. Except for Kangding High School, the class sizes of the other two schools are not complete.

The second district includes Yaan, Tianquan, Rongjing, Lushan, and Baoxing counties. Currently, there are Yaan Provincial High School, Yaan Girls' High School, and eight county high schools. Among them, Yaan Provincial High School is more complete, while the class sizes of the other schools are also scattered and incomplete.

The third district includes Hanyuan, Yuejun, and Mianning counties. Currently, there are Hanyuan County High School, Yuejun County High School, Hanyuan Private Yuwen Junior High School, and Mianning County Junior High School. Except for Hanyuan County High School, which has three senior high school classes, coeducational, and three junior high school classes for boys and girls separately, the other schools are coeducational.

The fourth district includes Xichang, Yanyuan, Dechang, Zhaojue, and Ningdong counties and bureaus. Among them, Xichang has the most secondary schools, including Xichang Provincial High School, County High School, County Girls' High School, and Lizhou County Junior High School. Each county and bureau has Dechang County Junior High School, Yanyuan County Junior High School, and Xichang Private Jiansheng Junior High School. Xichang Provincial High School was reorganized from the old Ningyuan Prefecture High School, and it is larger in scale and better equipped. Currently, it has three senior high school classes, coeducational, and six junior high school classes. The class sizes of the County High School are also the same. The other schools are either newly established or have few students, so there are not many achievements to speak of.

The fifth district includes Huili, Yanbian, and Ningnan counties. Except for Huili, which has a county high school with three senior and junior high school classes, the other two counties each have only one junior high school with incomplete class sizes. In total, there are twenty-three secondary schools in the five districts of the province, including four provincial high schools, five county high schools, ten county junior high schools, and four private junior high schools. Among them, except for one or two schools that were established earlier, the rest were established during the War of Resistance, so the equipment, teachers, etc. were affected by the war, and they were simple and crude. Books, instruments, and teacher funding were all meager, which weakened teaching efficiency and lowered student levels. This is a major defect in secondary education in Kang Province. Currently, knowledgeable people in the province are seeking ways to reform. The main points are as follows: (1) Enrich equipment, (2) Adjust school districts, (3) Improve standards, (4) Strengthen management, (5) Strictly select teachers. (Jian)

### Emergency Repair of the Yunzaobang Bridge

The Yunzaobang Bridge, located within the jurisdiction of District 23 (Wusong) of this city, is a vital transportation artery between Wusong and Shanghai. It has been in disrepair for many years and is severely damaged. After the victory, the district office and the Japanese Prisoner Management Office made some repairs, which are barely usable. Recently, since the Songhu Railway has not yet been connected to automobiles, frequent transportation has caused many holes to appear on the bridge surface, and there is a danger of collapse. In view of this, the Wusong Fortress Command and the district office held an emergency meeting on the 8th of this month at the Yong'an Yarn Factory to discuss the emergency repair of the bridge. Military, government, police, and industrial and commercial organizations in Wusong, as well as over twenty groups, initiated the organization of the Yunzaobang Bridge Emergency Repair Committee, which will begin work soon and is expected to be completed by the end of this month.

### Registration Period for Self-Defense Firearms Limited to the End of July This Year

However, registrations received by the bureau are far from enthusiastic, and cases of people committing crimes with firearms are frequently reported. In order to consolidate local security and maintain social stability, it is proposed to launch a widespread propaganda campaign through the Baojia system to report privately held firearms. All unlicensed civilian firearms must be registered with this bureau for licensing before the end of July this year. Those who still conceal them without reporting after the deadline will be prosecuted as possessing military firearms. People without firearms should not consider this matter unrelated to them. They should be aware that the loss of firearms among the people affects their own safety. If unlicensed firearms are found, they should be reported immediately to eliminate the source of chaos." It is reported that the department has instructed all districts to comply with this.

### District Briefs

District 2 District People's Representative Zhang Zhongyuan wishes to resign from his position as a District People's Representative after being elected as a Municipal Councilor. In addition, Lou Guanghua and Wu Bichao, District People's Representatives from the 25th Bao and 18th Bao of the district, have requested to resign because they serve as assistants and Bao cadres in the district office. The vacancies will be filled by substitute District People's Representatives Ma Qi and others from the respective Baos.

Colleagues from the Baojia system in District 16 are preparing to establish a consumer cooperative. They held a meeting at the district office the other day to discuss the implementation of the matter. District Chief Guo Qixun and Deputy District Chief Mao Dushi attended to provide guidance.

### Remittances from Overseas Chinese Show Significant Progress, Still Limited from Southeast Asia, Difficult to Directly Remit from Continental Europe

[Our Newspaper] After the victory, remittances from overseas Chinese from various places abroad have been restored one after another. However, before March 4 of this year, they were greatly affected due to the low exchange rate. After the new exchange rate was re-established on March 4, the number of remittances from overseas Chinese back to the country gradually increased. And the branches of the Bank of China in various places in Southeast Asia have also gradually resumed operations, making it very convenient for overseas Chinese to remit money back to the country. Moreover, international exchange has also been opened recently, no longer monopolized by the Bank of China. All designated Chinese and foreign banks can handle it. There are more than 30 designated banks including HSBC, Guangdong, Overseas Chinese, and Juxingcheng. In recent months, the number of remittances from overseas Chinese back to the country is the largest from the United States, followed by Southeast Asia. Taking only the Bank of China as an example, the overseas Chinese remittances received by it each month in recent months exceed 500,000 Legal Tender. However, although this number is far better than before the war, the currency value is by no means comparable to that before the war. Therefore, current remittances from overseas Chinese are actually not improved compared with before the war.

Regarding the situation of remittances from overseas Chinese in various places in Southeast Asia, because British territories such as the Malay Peninsula are still under control, remittances are subject to restrictions and the number is very limited. As for the Dutch East Indies, because order has not been fully restored and the branches of our national banks in that area have not resumed operations, they are currently stagnant. Burma is also under British control and remittances from overseas Chinese are restricted. Remittances from Siam are transferred through Haiphong, Vietnam, but the Bank of China may soon establish a branch there. At the same time, during the war, some overseas Chinese in Burma and Southeast Asia withdrew and returned to China because they were unwilling to be oppressed by the Japanese. Now they want to return to their original areas, but they are still subject to British entry restrictions, and most of them remain in the country. This is also the reason for the reduction of remittances from overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. The situation in the Philippines is better, and remittances from overseas Chinese are smooth.

In Europe, the Bank of China has a branch in London, and remittances to other regions are forwarded through London. Germany is still under the joint management of the Allies, and remittances from overseas Chinese are out of the question. In France, the franc exchange rate fluctuates greatly, making it difficult to remit money directly to China. Moreover, there are very few overseas Chinese in Continental Europe, and even fewer businessmen. National banks currently have no intention of establishing branches in Europe again. In fact, if overseas Chinese in Europe need to remit money back to the country, they can find ways to do so with the local consulate or hand it over to the London branch of the Bank of China for handling. According to banking sources: when Guangzhou was lost, the account books of a certain national bank that received remittances from overseas Chinese were unfortunately lost, and some remittances could not be traced. This problem is still an outstanding issue for remittances from overseas Chinese.

### Government Bonds Fall Again

After the high point, government bonds gradually felt empty. A major player on the fifth floor, who had been strongly advancing the previous day, partly covered his positions. After Tongbing morning opening, from above 1200, they gradually fell to around 850 yuan. Chaozhou merchants bought a small amount, and at noon they returned to near the 1,000 yuan mark. As a result, compared with the previous closing, it fell 120 yuan. Jia and Yi also fell slightly by 50 yuan, Ding fell by 90 yuan, and Wu rose and fell quickly, falling by 220 yuan.

### Guangdong Merchants' Purchases Drive Up Yarn Prices, American Cotton Soars, Local Cotton Trading Booms

Anda Yarn Factory offered Special Flying Tiger, priced at 1.22 million. Other large factories also made offers. Overall, the volume of transactions for the day was 2-30,000 yuan better than the previous day. The market seemed to show promise at the close, but it still needs the support of actual sales.

Yesterday, the New York American cotton telegraph soared another 98 to 100 pounds, with nearby at US$33.53, distant at US$33.76, and Midtling spot at US$34.19, seemingly an unprecedented high. Local cotton trading is booming, and market prices are becoming more attractive. The Textile Construction Company purchased 3,600 bales of the Midtling brand, while Xin Yuzhen, Xin Jia, and other factories each purchased 3-400 bales.

### Yong Yarn Shares Stand Out in Local Stocks Yesterday, Foreign Stocks Rise Across the Board as Demand Exceeds Supply

In local stocks, a certain industrial company strongly purchased 500,000 shares of Yong Yarn, and large stocks suddenly showed promise, while small stocks were only in a passive position, only improving slightly. Throughout the day, the price was lowest in the early morning and highest at noon. The large stocks were stable in the middle, while the small stocks, due to the issue of listing, had fewer expectations, and no one inquired about them, resulting in a volatile situation. The old stocks were still unable to make progress. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Yong Yarn rose 32 yuan, Meiya rose 170 yuan, and Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each rose by half a percent. Unpopular small and medium-sized stocks also rebounded slightly, while the veteran stocks did not advance but retreated.

Foreign stocks were in more demand than supply yesterday, and the price rebounded sharply. Yisha opened in the morning and rose to 7,200 yuan. After opening, the buying trend increased, and the price gradually rose to around 8,500 before entering a consolidation phase. Other stocks were also driven up. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Yisha and British Alliance rebounded by 20%, and Jardine Matheson, Jardine Brewery, Steel Industry, Asian Industry, and Guangzhou Paper Industry each rose by 10% to 15%.

### China Sugar White Continues to Fall

Lower Than Company's Opening Price

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to soften due to weak actual sales. The company's current cargo of No. 20 China Sugar White initially opened at 100,000 yuan, then fell to 98,000 yuan to 6,000 yuan, with the lowest at 93,000 yuan, and then slightly recovered by 5,000 yuan to 7,000 yuan, falling by 5-6,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Warehouse receipts initially fell by 4,000 yuan to 94,000 yuan, the lowest once breaking the 90,000 mark to 89,000 yuan, and then slightly rose to 90,000 to 90,500 yuan, falling by more than 7,000 yuan. No. 1 cargo only had a small number of transactions, and prices continued to decline. Huabang opened 20-30 packages of red sugar at 100,400 to 2,000 yuan, Shantou gang opened 40-50 packages of Huanggang Qing at 80,000 to 79,000 yuan, and ordinary cotton red more than 30 packages at 100,500.

### Crowded Ship Arrivals and Large Settlements, US Dollars Firm, Hong Kong Notes Rise, Gold Prices Stable and Slightly Lower by 5,000

Red dates were extremely stable yesterday. There was a slight consolidation during the central government's allocation, but due to the strong US dollar, buying interest remained strong. The morning opening was stable, and after opening, it gradually declined from 1.95 million. After 10:00 AM, the central government allocated 55 bars at 1.9375 million. After this, there was a small consolidation to 1.93 million. However, the buying trend of US dollars rose again, and at noon it returned to above 1.95 million. The afternoon was peaceful, with little fluctuations. As a result, compared with the previous closing, it fell slightly by 5,000. Gold ornaments were 110,800, silver 1,800, the dark discount on silver was loose, and the interest rate was 1.5 to 1.8 corners.

Foreign exchange, US dollars, initially stable and then attractive. Crowded ship arrivals, huge settlements. At the beginning of the session, it hovered around 2,550 yuan. After 10:00 AM, the situation tightened again. At noon, it rose to around 2,620 yuan and then slightly pulled back. In the afternoon, settlements stopped slightly, and the situation gradually stabilized. As a result, there was not much difference compared with the previous day. Hong Kong notes were attractive, and the result continued to rise by 5 yuan, Hong Kong exchange rate was around 540 yuan, Indian exchange rate was sold at 660 yuan, British exchange rate was 8,600 to 8,800, and there were not many transactions. The US exchange rate remained flat, and counterparty transactions were still sluggish.

### Grain Market Dynamics Gradually Improving

More Than 200 Rice Shops Can Sell Fair Rice Today

Since the Municipal White Rice Price Review Committee began reviewing the prices of various grains, the trading of north-south rice markets, which had been suspended for a long time, has gradually returned to normal. There were also arrivals from various producing areas yesterday morning, reaching more than 4,000 dan. Rice shops in the urban area have already put marked price grains on the market.

The authorities' regulations on purchasing low-priced rice with household permits were originally scheduled to begin universally yesterday. However, due to the procedures for shipping goods, it was permitted that more than one-tenth of the rice shops in each district of the city could sell today, on the morning, according to the current rice shops of approximately two thousand in the city, more than two hundred shops can be confirmed for the first phase. Flour supply and demand is abundant, and prices are fair. After several days of decline in oil prices, shops are actively restocking, recovering from fatigue, and rising by more than 1,000 yuan. Yellow soybeans are stable. Red grains are scarce and unsupported. Sesame market is active, and prices rise by 1-2,000 yuan. Bran is dull, falling by 100 yuan. Soybean cake is continuously used for farmland fertilizer, rising by 2-300 yuan. High-quality wheat selected by the Guangdong gang is moving but not strong, and the middle and lower grades are still sluggish. Factories are not actively stocking due to the sluggish flour market.

### Wuhan Securities Industry to Start Organizing Association

127 Members Registered

The Wuhan Securities Association attempted to resume its operations after the victory. However, due to the large difference between the market price and the face value of bonds after the war, and the high dark discount in the market, the number of bonds circulating in Wuhan was also less than in Shanghai, resulting in its failure to materialize. Recently, due to the government's announcement of the unified repayment of principal and interest on government bonds, bondholders have been actively seeking to sell their bonds, and the number of circulating chips has increased sharply. People engaged in this industry feel that it is necessary to actively prepare for a formal trading market and are starting to organize an association. A total of 127 members have already registered, and the official establishment date is expected to be around late August.

### Ministry of Finance May Allow Discretionary Reduction of Bank Reserve Requirements, Authorizing the Central Bank to Decide

Commercial banks are required to deposit reserve funds with the Central Bank for demand and time deposits. The banking associations in Tianjin, Shanghai, Ping, and Chongqing believe that this measure will significantly affect the flow of funds and have expressed their opinions one after another. It is understood that the government, in consideration of the difficulties faced by businesses, may make changes to the amount of reserve funds to be deposited. The original 20% reserve requirement for demand deposits may be reduced to 15%, and the original 15% reserve requirement for time deposits may also be reduced to 7%. The Ministry of Finance has authorized the Central Bank to make discretionary decisions.

### Decline in US Silk Prices Affects Chinese Silk Exports

Since the news that the price of domestic silk in the US market will drop from US$9 per pound to US$6 per pound was reported, it has caused deep anxiety among silk merchants in various places. According to Ge Jingzhong, General Manager of China Silk Corporation, China's silk production this year is only one-tenth of what it was before the war. Of the 12,000 bales shipped to the US, calculated at US$9 per pound, only a little over US$10 million in foreign exchange can be recovered. And there is currently talk of lowering the value of raw silk in the United States. If this happens, the situation will be even more unthinkable. Currently, the company has 200 bales of raw silk shipped to the US, all calculated at a price of $9 per pound. However, based on the exchange rate, the loss is more than one-third per pound. If the price of raw silk in the United States drops from $9 to $6 per pound, domestic silk merchants will be discouraged from moving forward, and the export of raw silk is worrying. Therefore, it is hoped that the government can adjust tariffs as soon as possible to save the silk industry from its desperate situation.

### Summer Woolen Fabrics Plummet

Summer woolen fabrics have completely gone out of season by today. Only door shops have a slight sales volume left. Looking at the seasonal goods of this summer, such as Palice, Fanting, Feather Yarn, etc., their crazy price increases were truly beyond expectations. To this day, autumn and winter prices are uniquely affected by this. Now that the season has passed, buyers are indifferent, and although those who are trapped want to sell at a loss, there are no buyers. White straight tributes and white drill crashes are especially severe. Although linen canvas and waxed thread canvas are manufactured by this factory, they are falling sharply. Although it is related to the passing of the sales day, the shift in people's hearts is more drastic than in previous years. Screw four wool and Ban four wool, because they can still be sold for a short period in early autumn, so the decline is relatively mild. French velvet can be sold in both cold and hot seasons, only the colors are changed, so it can maintain the current state. The sales of Barré and Fat Biji are far less than that of Palice and Feather Yarn, so their trend is even weaker than the above-mentioned goods. Xue克斯 topped in summer. The demand and supply of this commodity were both quiet, and it disappeared from the market long ago. American twill fabrics have become a popular commodity, and the drop is very small.

### Business Summary

Tea: Regarding the tea market for foreign firms, recently, British firm Jardine Matheson and the Zhiyutai Tea Company have frequently inspected and bid on Keemun aged black tea. However, the price offered for top-grade goods is only slightly over 80,000 yuan per dan (a unit of weight), making it difficult to break the deadlock. As for stores and firms in this district from Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places, given the good sales, there are still inquiries, and the overall market trend is steadily flat.

Hardware: Wood screws continue to rise. Lock factories are offering higher prices than the market, but due to limited sales, they are temporarily selling at the original price. The first batch of imported "Knife Brand" triangular files was sold out due to the small quantity. Current asking prices have increased by 10-20%. GTD screws have arrived, and their prices are higher than OK Yau Kang (another brand). Small-sized decorated tubes remain firm and expensive, while large-sized decorated tubes are slightly trending upward. There has not been much change in steel plates.

Seafood: Affected by tight credit, trading is sluggish. With the arrival of the hot summer, sales have declined. Shrimp tails, sea swallow nests, tapioca starch, and wood ear from Hunan have shifted from stable to weak. Agar-agar, shiitake mushrooms, and sago have all seen declines. Squid, American ginseng, dried opened sea cucumber, and kelp are also struggling to hold their ground. However, the arrival of shiitake mushrooms is scarce, reducing consumption, and showing signs of strength. Prices of other goods are generally flat.

Wood: The lumber market improved slightly yesterday. Buyers made some purchases, sales were active, and prices rose.

### World Gold Reserves: Totaling 34,000 Tons; The United States Holds More Than Two-Thirds

Gold is now viewed as important. According to estimates from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the world's total gold reserves are approximately $29,080,000,000. Calculated at the legal gold content of the U.S. dollar (15 and 5/21 grains), the world's total gold reserves are approximately 34,202.5 metric tons. Before the Pacific War, the United States held more than 80% of the world's gold. It currently holds 69% (i.e., slightly more than 23,599 tons). In the early stages of the European war, much of Europe's gold flowed into the United States. After the Pacific War, the United States paid in gold for wartime raw materials purchased from countries in Central and South America, resulting in a slight decrease in U.S. gold reserves and a sharp increase in reserves in South and Central American nations. The following is a list of gold holdings by country as of the end of January this year: (Units: Millions of USD)

United States 20,156 South Africa 949

France 1,576 India 274

Switzerland 1,099 Turkey 241

### My Air Force's Eighth Group: Journey to Tokyo

— Zhu Minwei

Our Aircraft Proceeds at an Airspeed of 160 Knots

As soon as our plane took off, it entered the clouds. We felt raindrops falling like pinpricks. In the cabin, two of our comrades, with the assistance of Chief Mechanic Xu Shulin, prepared various items and flew towards 78 degrees. At the same time, they increased the altitude of the plane. I looked at the scene outside the window through the glass, and it was all white clouds. However, the plane's engines were right before my eyes. Relying on the horsepower of these one or two engines, we proceeded at an airspeed of 160 knots.

The B-24 aircraft was the most frequently used aircraft by the United States during this war, especially in the European theater. Based in England, it was mainly used to bomb German front lines and rear areas. The silver-white, four-engine plane with tail rudder was widely used. Not only the U.S. Air Force used it, but the U.S., Canada, and the Soviet Union all borrowed it through the Lend-Lease Act. The first B-24 aircraft to enter China arrived from the Soviet Union when Wendell Willkie visited China. Soon after, Chennault's 14th Air Force used it from Kunming to bomb Japanese bases in Hanoi, Haiphong, and other places. Later, the B-24 also participated in bombing Hong Kong and Wuhan. The majestic silhouette of the "Liberator" aircraft spread throughout the country and abroad. However, the nine-hour flight range of this aircraft was not sufficient to bomb the Japanese mainland in the Pacific, so the Americans specially built the B-29, a super fortress with a sixteen-hour flight range, to carry out long-range bombing. From then on, the Japanese mainland was plunged into disintegration. After island-hopping and capturing the Ogasawara Islands, Iwo Jima, and the Ryukyu Islands, the power of the B-24 aircraft could also reach the Japanese mainland. As a result, the silver-white "lady" also frequently visited the beautiful Japanese islands. The Air Force's Eighth Group, having hastily completed training in the United States, rushed back to the Far East. While waiting for orders in India, it was supposed to be stationed on the Ryukyu Islands to participate in the final attacks by the U.S. military on Japan. However, before this grand ambition could be realized, Japan surrendered! This naturally disappointed the group. Though life has entered an era of peace, troops bearing heavy responsibility for national defense must still maintain vigilance on the front line and be concerned about all the realities within their realm. The Eighth Group is therefore ordered to regularly conduct familiarization flights centered on Shanghai to maintain a high level of flight proficiency.

As Group Commander Wang Shijun lit a cigarette in the cockpit, we smelled the aroma of the smoke. Even though the plane was flying blindly in the clouds (the boundaries between heaven and earth cannot be seen; navigation is guided by instruments, hence the term "blind flying," although today the Americans call it "instrument flying"), the first stage of tension and haste had passed. Our plane had entered a state of stable and continuous flight. When Captain Wang Guonan also lit a cigarette, the habit of smoking spread to our radio cabin. Chen Gong, wearing a headset and watching the transmitter and notebook, also smoked. Xu Shulin, running back and forth, up and down, to manipulate various mechanical switches, also smoked. The few of us also smoked and ate candy. Regiment Commander Zhu Shiming ate nothing, only swallowing a small white pill from a small copper box.

In the relaxed atmosphere of smoking, Xu Shulin first told me: In order for a large, thirty-ton aircraft to fly steadily in clouds where neither heaven nor earth can be seen, in addition to the compass and the level, there is also a row of six amber-colored indicator lights that constantly flash to alert the pilot. These six small, loquat-sized lights have the following functions: The four lights on the left side are parallel. The first light indicates left roll, the second indicates right roll, the third indicates yaw to the left, and the fourth indicates yaw to the right. Of the two small lights on the right side, if the top light flashes, it indicates that the nose is pointing upward; if the bottom light flashes, it indicates that the tail is pointing upward. Relying on the flashing of these six small yellow lights, the pilot makes gentle, slow, and small adjustments to the aircraft to keep it moving in a level flight path over long distances.

At eleven o'clock, the celestial sphere could be seen. Wang Shijun looked up at the clouds above and said:

"There are three layers of clouds over the sea today."

Wang Guonan nodded and said:

"Jiangwan isn't calling for takeoff."

Pilots love to adhere to scheduled times. Wang Shijun himself set the takeoff time for the 20th. When the time came, he obeyed the order himself, not postponing due to the adverse weather conditions at sea. However, the American base provided a good forecast: Although it was raining and cloudy in the target location, Tokyo, in the morning, just like Shanghai, the weather would clear up when the plane arrived in the afternoon. The clouds would dissipate, the rain would stop, and the ground would be clear, so that the plane would not encounter cloud-covered Mount Fuji and crash into its snowy peak. Based on this forecast, Captain Wang Guonan filled out the flight plan, and the Americans immediately telegraphed the U.S. military station in Japan to announce that a Chinese B-24 aircraft had taken off, climbed to 18,000 feet, and was flying towards Japan, and instructed the aircraft to contact the U.S. military station in Japan when it was close to the Japanese mainland.

### A Navigator Who Won't Get Lost

At eleven o'clock, they changed course to 83 degrees, the direction calculated by navigator Huang Eryi. Huang Eryi had already entered the navigator's compartment in front of and below the cockpit. He was alone, working on the ground speed, time, and compass. Finally, he told the pilot to change course to 83 degrees at 11:00 (slightly south of the original heading). Huang Eryi is from Shanghai. In two years in the United States, he learned the ability to navigate B-24s to any region, like a pilot or navigator on a sea vessel who won't get lost.

At twelve o'clock, we saw the sea. Below the plane at 9,000 feet were white clouds, thin wisps covering the pale blue sea. This scene made first-time viewers think that the inverted sky was below the plane, but the plane was flying forward, not backward. The pale blue color was of course the sea. (From this, I got the impression that the sea reflects the light of the clouds as pale blue rather than turquoise.) Li Maoh suddenly took off his headphones and said with a worried expression: "It's raining in Tokyo."

I knew this news was quite serious, hence his worried expression. But he quickly added: "It will clear up at 3 p.m. That's when we'll arrive in Tokyo." This naturally put us at ease.

The plane entered another cloud formation, colliding with or avoiding clouds, and the fuselage was rocking up, down, left, and right. I was worried that the four female typists from the Chinese delegation would vomit, but fortunately, they were all normal. I asked them about their number of flights. Two of them were first-timers, one was a second-timer, and one, Miss Bai Yang, who looked like a Japanese girl, had flown sixteen times. She had been to Kunming and Chongqing. She had previously worked as a typist for the U.S. military, and she called herself an "old flyer," which made us laugh.

At twelve thirty-five, Xu Shulin told me: The Japanese mainland is below. He pointed down, pointed to the window. Green forests and yellow land were interspersed. The yellow roads looked like irregular belts of clothing left on the ground. Kyushu, judging from its appearance, is an agricultural, forestry, and fishing area. This can be inferred simply from the fact that the roads are not wide and there are not many railways. But in reality, it has the famous mining areas of Xiaobayashi and Baba and railway lines also extend to any location. A brief glance at the exterior cannot reveal the contents clearly, just as looking at a person's appearance cannot reveal their inner thoughts. After passing over the northern tip of Kyushu, the plane flew over the straits of Japan between Shikoku and Honshu. At one ten, Regiment Commander Zhu Huiming came down from the cockpit and said: "The plane is flying towards Osaka!" Xu Shulin predicted: "We'll be in Osaka at 2:05!" (To be continued)

Loyal Employees Request Reinstatement

The Suzhou Electric Company was established with funds from Changzhou natives and was founded more than ten years before the War of Resistance. It was originally managed by Manager Ding Chunzhi, who put in a great deal of effort and painstaking management, allowing the business to flourish. We have served at the company since before the war and for many years. We believe that we have been able to fulfill our duties and made contributions to laying the foundation for the business. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Japanese invaders have wreaked havoc with their military force and frenzied aggression. At that time, we either withdrew westward with the army or fulfilled our duties until the last minute before taking refuge in the countryside to escape the disaster and survive. After the Japanese invaders occupied Suzhou, the company was seized by the Japanese invaders, forcibly reorganized, and Japanese were appointed as advisors and important officials in various departments. Manager Ding's authority was stripped, and he died indignantly in protest. At that time, we could have requested reinstatement, but out of a sense of righteousness, we never dared to be coerced by the enemy and puppets, preferring to live in exile or in poverty in Songjia Garden, pawning our belongings to survive. In August of the thirty-fourth year, the War of Resistance was won, and the Japanese invaders surrendered. The Suzhou Electric Company was taken over by Zhang Zhitong, an engineer from the company before the war, who was appointed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to be responsible for the takeover and to oversee everything. Seeing the dawn of a new day, we jointly signed a request to Zhang to grant us reinstatement (those who had fled to the provinces of Sichuan and Hunan had returned to Suzhou one after another and also intended to participate in the reinstatement) and requested that all those who were employed during the enemy-puppet period after November of the twenty-sixth year, who accounted for about two-thirds of the current staff, be dismissed in order to clarify right and wrong and encourage loyalty. However, Zhang believed that the company would soon be returned to private ownership and it was not convenient to readily agree to our request, so he delayed for several months without a concrete reply. Under the increasingly high pressure of daily life, we increasingly felt that our livelihoods could not be sustained. In May of this year, the company was returned by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and a reorganization committee was formed to reorganize the company. Upon hearing the news, we again requested reinstatement from the reorganization committee. Another month has passed, and there are still no results. It is reported that the committee discussed this issue in its meetings, expressing sympathy, but regrettably delayed implementation, which is deeply regrettable. Now, we are making a final appeal and earnestly request that the relevant authorities understand the suffering of the unemployed employees and quickly reinstate all the employees. We hope that you will do so. (Sincerely, more than twenty former employees of the Suzhou Electric Company who left their jobs before the war)

Health and Medicine

### Summer Diarrhea

— Lin Zhaoqi

Clarification

While the term "summer diarrhea" is common, its meaning is quite vague. Firstly, it does not specifically refer to one particular disease, but rather broadly encompasses various diarrheal conditions caused by different pathogens (i.e., germs). Secondly, diarrhea is not limited to the summer season; it also occurs in the autumn, and a small number of cases occur year-round.

Besides "summer diarrhea," another term commonly used to refer to acute bacterial diarrhea is "food poisoning." However, the term "food poisoning" is too broad and easily leads to misunderstanding. The term suggests that the food itself is poisonous, which is certainly true in cases of pufferfish poisoning or mushroom poisoning. However, in acute bacterial diarrhea, the food itself does not contain toxins; it is simply contaminated with bacteria that cause diarrhea when consumed. Using the term "food poisoning" for diarrhea leads to the misconception that the cause lies in the food itself, rather than in the bacteria.

From the above, it is clear that neither "summer diarrhea" nor "food poisoning" is an appropriate term. If we were to find a more suitable term, we might call it "acute bacterial diarrhea." However, this is still a general term. If we focus on the part of the body affected by the disease, we could use terms like "acute bacterial colitis" or "acute bacterial enterocolitis." If we want to specify that a certain type of diarrhea is caused by a specific bacterium, then the name of that bacterium should be used.

Pathogens

All cases of acute bacterial diarrhea are caused by eating food contaminated with bacteria or bacterial toxins. The types of bacteria that cause diarrhea include: (1) Salmonella species, especially *Salmonella choleraesuis*, *Salmonella enteritidis*, *Salmonella paratyphi A*, *Salmonella paratyphi B*; (2) Shigella species; (3) Staphylococcus aureus toxins; (4) In addition, some microorganisms are harmless themselves, such as *Escherichia coli*, *Proteus vulgaris*, *Bacillus recti*, *Streptococcus lactis*, *Streptococcus viridans*, etc. However, under favorable conditions (for bacteria), they can multiply in certain foods and produce toxins, leading to gastrointestinal discomfort after consumption. Among these four types of bacteria, Salmonella species are the largest source of acute bacterial diarrhea. Salmonella bacteria are most easily found in pork, milk, fish, and eggs, and are less likely to grow in vegetables, grains, and fresh fruits. Unhygienic meat comes from two sources: one is diseased pigs and cattle—pigs and cattle, like humans, can be infected with Salmonella species and suffer from gastrointestinal and other diseases. People who eat meat from diseased pigs and cattle can become infected and develop diarrhea. The other source is healthy livestock, but the livestock becomes contaminated with bacteria during slaughtering, cooking, or curing, which is enough to cause diarrhea. If a cow's udder is infected with bacteria, the milk produced will inevitably be contaminated. In addition, it is common for cow dung to contain bacteria and contaminate the milk. In recent years, there has been considerable research into the transmission of disease through eggs. Research suggests that undercooked duck eggs are more likely to transmit disease than chicken or pigeon eggs. This is because ducks are very susceptible to enteritis, and duck eggs can become infected with bacteria within the mother's body.

Acute bacterial diarrhea caused by Staphylococcus aureus toxins typically has a very short incubation period. Patients experience vomiting, diarrhea, cramps, and sometimes even fainting. Canned fish and meat, preserved fish and meat, and milk are all likely to be contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus. However, according to research statistics, cases of diarrhea caused by Staphylococcus aureus toxins are not very common and do not pose a serious threat.

Epidemiology

Acute bacterial diarrhea is most prevalent in the summer and autumn, likely due to the hot weather, which favors bacterial growth, and the increased activity of flies, which spread the disease. In addition to seasonal factors, other factors that contribute to the spread of diarrhea should also be considered, such as overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, contaminated drinking water, and spoiled food.

The infectiousness of acute bacterial diarrhea is very high. Almost everyone who eats food containing the bacteria will develop diarrhea. Those who are spared may have consumed a small amount, have sufficient stomach acid to kill the bacteria, or have strong resistance. According to Geiger's statistics, 75% to 100% of people who eat contaminated food develop diarrhea.

However, the mortality rate of acute bacterial diarrhea is very low. According to Geiger's statistics, the mortality rate in the United States is only 0.5%, and according to Shah's statistics, the mortality rate in the United Kingdom is only 1.5%. There is little difference in the morbidity and mortality rates between male and female patients. In terms of age, the mortality rate is higher in young children and the elderly. Opium addiction, coexisting chronic illnesses that weaken the body, starvation, and malnutrition can all worsen acute bacterial diarrhea.

The incubation period for Salmonella species and Shigella species diarrhea ranges from half an hour to 24 hours. Diarrhea caused by Staphylococcus aureus toxins has a shorter incubation period, generally between half an hour and four hours. The more toxins present in the food, the faster the symptoms appear. In addition, the length of the incubation period depends on other factors. For example, if the contaminated food is eaten on an empty stomach, the symptoms will appear quickly. Also, if everything eaten is contaminated or contains bacterial toxins, the symptoms will appear earlier than if the food is eaten along with other foods. Because food enters the stomach first, acute gastritis symptoms occur earlier than acute enteritis and colitis symptoms. Patients initially feel bloating in the upper abdomen, followed by pain, and then vomiting. Initially, the vomit consists of food and mucus, but no gastric juices, or very little. Then, the vomiting consists of mucus, saliva, and bile, sometimes with a small amount of blood. This is followed by abdominal cramps and pain, dizziness, collapse, and other symptoms. Severe vomiting often leads to dehydration, profuse sweating, muscle cramps, restlessness, cold and clammy skin, facial wasting, hoarseness, rapid breathing, a temperature below normal, low blood pressure, depleted peripheral veins, and a weak pulse. The appearance of the stool depends on the part of the intestine affected. In enteritis, the stool is voluminous, watery, and foul-smelling. In colitis, the stool contains mucus, blood, or pus, but is not watery. Patients sometimes experience anal pain and swelling, due to irritation of the rectum or because the colitis has spread to the rectum. Mild cases of acute symptoms resolve spontaneously within 12 to 24 hours. For the next few days, there is a loss of appetite, weakness, and mild abdominal discomfort. Large amounts of food cannot be consumed. After this, recovery is complete. Even in severe cases, if treated properly, recovery can be uneventful, though it may take longer. However, if diarrhea is complicated by other conditions, there is a risk of the condition worsening. Patients may die from severe poisoning, extreme dehydration, or sudden energy depletion (due to acidosis and uremia). Sometimes, after the initial symptoms—vomiting and diarrhea—appear, symptoms similar to typhoid fever follow, because other internal organs and tissues have been invaded by bacteria. In this case, the illness will be prolonged and there is often a risk of complications, such as bronchopneumonia, vitamin deficiency, bedsores, and metastatic pyemia. Sometimes, after a person has acute bacterial diarrhea, the bacteria in the intestine are not completely eliminated despite treatment, leading to chronic recurrent enterocolitis, which can persist for years, similar to chronic or recurrent dysentery.

Detection of Transmission

Acute bacterial diarrhea is usually not difficult to diagnose, especially when multiple members of the same household are affected. Sometimes, several people in a family develop diarrhea at the same time, because they ate contaminated food at the same time. Sometimes, family members develop diarrhea at different times, because they ate at different times, or because of person-to-person transmission.

Whether acute bacterial diarrhea occurs on a small scale within a family or on a large scale in a group of people or a location, the following procedures should be used to investigate: (1) Compile a complete case history; (2) Collect medical histories; (3) Identify the route of transmission; (4) Investigate the source of the causative food; (5) Collect various pieces of evidence to determine how the food became contaminated with bacteria or toxins. In addition, collect and examine various items related to the occurrence and transmission of diarrhea: (1) Leftover food; (2) The patient's vomit and stool (examining vomit is often less reliable than examining stool); (3) If there are signs that the bacteria have invaded other parts of the body, bone marrow cultures, blood cultures, stool cultures, saliva cultures, and agglutination tests should be performed; (4) If the patient dies, bacterial cultures should be performed on the contents of the intestine, the intestinal mucosa, the intestinal mucosal lymph nodes, bone marrow, heart blood, spleen, and liver. (5) If the examination does not find Salmonella or Shigella, then the food consumed should be examined for the presence of bacterial toxins.

Prevention

In addition to emphasizing environmental hygiene, personal hygiene, and clean drinking water, the prevention of acute bacterial diarrhea requires various preventive measures to protect meat (because acute bacterial diarrhea is mostly transmitted through meat, meat is given special attention) from bacterial contamination from slaughtering to cooking and consumption. Health authorities should strictly inspect meat, and diseased animals should be absolutely prohibited from sale and consumption. Restaurants and families should not hire cooks who have had intestinal illnesses. Food should be fresh and thoroughly cooked before consumption. Canned foods often still contain living bacteria even after being boiled for more than an hour; these are mostly thermophilic bacteria or spore-forming bacteria. According to the results of numerous tests and studies, canned food contains bacteria in about 7% of cases. However, freshly prepared foods contain even more bacteria than canned foods, so they must be cooked thoroughly before eating—even if cooking does not kill all the bacteria, it will at least reduce their numbers significantly. If food is not eaten immediately after cooking, it should be stored in a cool place, preferably in the refrigerator. Otherwise, the remaining bacteria will multiply and cause problems.

During this cholera epidemic, some people may mistake severe acute bacterial diarrhea for cholera. In fact, their transmission routes are quite similar, and their prevention methods are also similar - all drinks and food must be cooked and disinfected!!!

Bacterial Stories

### An Autobiography of a Malarial Protozoan

— Tao Shouqi

It has been more than sixty years since I was first discovered by humans in 1880. However, apart from the medical community, many people still lack adequate understanding of me. Allow me to take this opportunity to introduce myself.

I am one of the most basic members of the animal kingdom. My entire body is made up of a single cell, so zoologists call me a "malarial protozoan." When I am young, my body is only about one-tenth to one-twelfth the size of a human red blood cell. When I am at my largest, I am only slightly larger than a normal red blood cell.

Although my body is so simple and small, my life experience is quite complex. My entire life cycle can be divided into the following two phases:

(1) The first is the asexual reproduction cycle—which occurs within human blood. I enter the human body when a certain type of mosquito bites a person, carrying me from its mouth into the person's skin and into the bloodstream. In the blood, I reside in red blood cells and rely on the nutrients in the red blood cells to grow and reproduce. Every one, two, or three days, I divide from one into more than ten. After a period of time, I also produce reproductive protozoa, which are differentiated into male and female. These reproductive protozoa must be passed on through inoculation, which requires the mosquito to bite a person again, allowing them to enter the mosquito's stomach from its mouth.

(2) From here, we begin the sexual reproduction cycle. In the mosquito's stomach, the male and female protozoa combine and burrow into the stomach wall, gradually growing into an oocyst. When mature, the oocyst ruptures, releasing many reproductive sporozoites, which spread throughout the mosquito's body, especially in its salivary glands. This entire sexual reproduction cycle takes an average of ten to twelve days to complete. If the mosquito bites a person again at this time, it can carry my reproductive sporozoites along with its saliva into the person's blood, initiating a new asexual reproduction cycle.

To fully convey the hardships of my life, I must add a few more points about my living conditions:

(1) My parasitic life is an absolute necessity (known as obligate parasitism in parasitology), meaning that I absolutely cannot survive outside of the human body or the mosquito.

(2) Among mosquitoes, not every type of mosquito can host me. Only a few species within the Anopheles genus are suitable. Moreover, these mosquitoes are often disliked by humans. If the mosquitoes are harmed, I will also not be able to survive.

(3) In the human body, I parasitize red blood cells, which are a very important part of life. Therefore, my growth inside inevitably harms human health, causing various terrible malarial symptoms, and sometimes even death. If my host dies, I can only perish along with them. This situation is the most unfortunate for us who live a parasitic life.

Living such a mysterious and depressing life, I truly harm both myself and others. Fortunately, until now, many people still do not understand the truth about malaria. They do not know that I am the one causing trouble, and still believe that malaria is caused by inhaling some miasma in the air or drinking some dirty water on the ground. Otherwise, in this era of advancing human science, with increasingly effective methods of mosquito control, my survival and growth would be greatly threatened.

### Heatstroke

— Zheng Weiru

Yang Yannian had just finished his junior high school final exams on the afternoon of June 29th. Days of preparing for lessons and submitting exam papers had caused him to eat much less at each meal. Furthermore, he had a strong competitive spirit, so he would cram into the night before each exam. Now that the final exams were successfully completed, he felt as if a great burden had been lifted, and he was elated. The fatigue caused by preparing for the exams before was now completely gone. Therefore, he arranged to go on a picnic with his brother to the outskirts of Jiangwan on Sunday, the 30th. His brother saw that Yannian was happy and in high spirits, and to reward him for his hard work on the exams, he couldn't bear to refuse his younger brother's request. Besides, the 30th was Sunday, a perfect opportunity to accompany him and have a good time. So he readily agreed. He would take care of all the preparations for the picnic himself, which made Yannian even happier. Since the War of Resistance, the enemy's blockades and alerts had confined Yannian's active mind as if in a cage. Now that the War of Resistance had been won, he would be able to freely roam the Jiangwan city center, which he had dreamed of day and night, tomorrow.

The next morning at ten o'clock, the two of them took streetcar, carrying dry food and fruit. The car was very crowded and bumpy, and Yannian felt a little unwell, but because he was in high spirits, he perked himself up. After getting off the car, he walked for more than ten minutes in the sun and was already a bit tired. His legs felt heavy, his chest was heavy and stuffy, and even breathing felt weak. At this point, he staggered, felt dizzy, and everything went dark before his eyes. He suddenly fell into his brother's arms. Fortunately, his brother had noticed that Yannian's face was pale, his lips had no color, sweat was dripping from his forehead, he had a pained expression, and he was walking with difficulty, so he knew something was wrong. When he saw his brother about to fall, he grabbed him with one hand and felt that Yannian's arm was very cold. He repeatedly called out, "Yannian, Yannian, what's wrong?" His younger brother replied weakly, "I feel awful, I feel awful." At this point, Yannian had been moved to the shade of a tree by the roadside and was lying propped up against the trunk. His brother opened his collar, wiped away the sweat, and applied the peppermint lozenge he had brought around his lips. He saw that Yannian was much more awake at this point, so he cut an orange for him to eat. Yannian gradually recovered and was able to sit up with effort. His brother was greatly relieved and hired a car to take him home to rest.

The above passage describes a common heatstroke and exhaustion scenario seen in the summer. In high temperatures and high relative humidity, coupled with physiological abnormalities, excessive nervous tension, clothing that is too thick or tight, poor ventilation, and crowded conditions, the heart function is most likely to become unbalanced, leading to fainting. Therefore, in first aid, the patient should be moved to a cool and ventilated place as soon as possible. Loosen or remove clothing. Splash cold water on the face or chest to help the patient wake up, or use aromatic spirits or alcohol as stimulants to get the patient out of danger. Heat exhaustion is the mildest form of heatstroke, but if not treated properly, it can also lead to death!

There is also hyperthermic heatstroke, which is endemic in tropical regions. This disease often occurs in new immigrants to the tropics. It seems less common among locals, probably because people accustomed to hot climates have bodies that have become adept at coping with high temperatures. In the Shanghai area, this condition can also be seen in the summer. The cause is also being in an environment of high temperature and high relative humidity, drinking too little water, wearing inappropriate clothing, and cessation of sweating, so that body heat cannot be released temporarily. Sometimes the cessation of sweating lasts from one hour to forty-eight hours, and the heat produced by the body has no way to dissipate and accumulates in the body, leading to a continuous rise in body temperature. The patient may have vomiting and diarrhea, resembling cholera, or be mentally restless, agitated, and delirious, with hot and dry skin. When the rectal temperature reaches 42.2 degrees Celsius, consciousness is immediately lost. If such a high fever is allowed to persist for two hours, there is often no hope of recovery. Therefore, treatment should be as fast as possible, otherwise a delay of a few hours will result in the patient being beyond help. The main goal is to reduce the body temperature to a safe degree. The method is to pour cold water all over the body and then fan the air around the body, or wrap the patient's body in a wet towel and then fan the air. This method uses artificial means to give the body the effect of sweating, in order to reduce body temperature. Another method is to place the patient in water at 11 degrees Celsius while vigorously rubbing the entire body to accelerate blood circulation and allow the high body temperature to be dissipated. At the same time, pay attention to the rectal temperature. If it reaches 38.8 degrees Celsius, the patient should be removed from the cold water to prevent a sharp drop in body temperature, which can lead to collapse. Experiments have shown that the heat required for one gram of water to evaporate from the skin is about half a calorie. If one gram of ice is placed on the skin to melt, the heat absorbed from the skin is less than one-tenth of a calorie. Therefore, using ice to reduce body temperature is not as effective as using water. Moreover, when the skin encounters excessively cold ice, the capillaries will often contract, which is another obstacle to reducing body temperature. In the past, some people used ice water enemas to reduce high body temperature, but experiments have shown that using one kilogram of ice water enema reduces the heat equivalent to the heat from evaporating 70 grams of water from the skin. Other treatments, such as intravenous injection of physiological saline to promote the excretion of toxins, and the use of cardiac and respiratory stimulants, should be determined according to the patient's condition.

There is also so-called sunstroke, which is caused by direct sunlight on the human body. The symptoms are similar to meningitis. The patient has extreme headaches, hot and dry skin, photophobia, vomiting, and even high fever and delirium. The treatment is generally the same as for hyperthermic heatstroke.

There is also a type of heatstroke in which the symptoms are mainly abdominal or general pain with spasms, and the body temperature is not too high. This is because the patient works in high temperatures, sweats a lot, and feels thirsty, so they drink a lot of water to quench their thirst. However, the high-temperature environment remains unchanged. They continue to sweat, continue to feel thirsty, and this cycle continues. Because the water they drink does not contain salt, but the sweat they produce contains from 6/10,000 to 6/1,000 of salt. The salt in the body continues to be excreted in sweat without being replenished, leading to painful spasms. Therefore, in terms of treatment, in addition to moving the patient out of the high-heat environment, intravenous injection of physiological saline is the only treatment. Workers working in high temperatures should often use 1/1,000 salt water as a drink. During the recent war, British cruisers used 1% cold salt water as a drink.

Humanity is uniquely blessed, and is able to adapt to all kinds of harsh environments. People live even in the icy Arctic. In tropical regions, where the climate is above 40 degrees Celsius, humans can also be found. In order to survive, they must engage in various activities. For example, coal stokers on tropical ships sometimes have to work at 65 degrees Celsius, and they do not experience heatstroke. It can be seen that as long as one is healthy and the physiological regulation function is normal, and does not allow physical strength to be overexerted, in addition to nutrition, one should supplement an appropriate amount of water and salt. Even if the working environment is high temperature and high relative humidity, as long as it is ventilated and breathable, and the clothing worn does not hinder sweating and heat dissipation, then the heat generated by our work, 25% of which must be dissipated through skin evaporation and breathing, and 75% dissipated through skin radiation and convection, will not accumulate in the body. Then, although it cannot be said that there will be no risk of heatstroke, it can greatly reduce it.

When Chinese people fall ill in the summer, whether it is typhoid fever, cholera, vomiting and diarrhea caused by improper diet, or heatstroke-related illnesses, they often underestimate it as "feeling unwell." If not given appropriate treatment, it will delay the patient and lead to death.

### Save the Teachers

— Shaofu

I want to appeal for many primary and secondary school teachers! Although the "Respect Teachers" movement has passed, I hope everyone, when they see their children, will think of their teachers, respect them, love them, and consider the teachers' lives. It is no less than thinking about the future of your own children.

Not just one, not just ten, many, many primary and secondary school teachers I know have reached the point where they have no clothes to wear and nothing to sell. Among them, many are using loans to set up newspaper stands or run mobile glass cabinets. In this day after the victory of the War of Resistance, this kind of scene is happening, and it is happening to this group of intellectuals, role models for people. Do we not feel ashamed?

When people are poor, their ambitions fade. If teachers are worrying about firewood and rice every day, how can they have the heart to teach your children? Moreover, in order to maintain the dignity of teachers, you cannot allow your children to despise, disregard, or demean their teachers. A teacher dressed in rags, standing on the podium, your young ladies and young masters will often whisper, saying: "A beggar! A lousy Russian!"

No need to elaborate further, saying what for the sake of cultivating talent for the country, even for your own glory, even for your children to be able to stand on their own in society in the future, you must think about this large group of people who work diligently and eat chalk dust.

If any readers would like to donate to this cause, this newspaper is willing to provide its services.

### Talking About "Color"

— Dongfang Jing

In 1931, the famous Belgian student scientists, Auguste and Jean Piccard, made their first stratospheric exploration flight. The ship was painted white, which resulted in a lot of ice and frost, and they almost froze to death. In 1932, they made their second flight into the stratosphere, painting the ship black, and they almost burned to death. Later, two U.S. Marine Corps officers explored the stratosphere, painting half of the ship light and the other half dark. Their flight was extremely pleasant and comfortable -- the air they breathed was cool and refreshing, and their legs felt warm.

Today, psychologists and scientists have shown us that in many ways, color is of great help to the comfort of daily life.

Antarctic explorers paint their water bottle bags black to prevent freezing. During the day, these water bags absorb plenty of sunlight, keeping the water in the bottles at 60 degrees, even though the outside temperature is minus 35 degrees.

Soviet ships have always been painted red, but two years ago, they were repainted black to conserve heat. The crew members not only felt much more comfortable, but their work efficiency also increased greatly.

The power of black to absorb sunlight is amazing. Frozen harbors can be cleared of snow, painted black, and thawed several weeks earlier. The ice and snow on a black road melt faster than on a white road.

Black horses suffer more from the heat of the sun than horses of other colors, so black horses have shorter lifespans than white horses.

In terms of health, the power of color is remarkable. Color engineers prevent "flight sickness" by adjusting the colors inside aircraft. They have found that brown and yellow are likely to cause vomiting, while green and blue can prevent vomiting. One airline, following the advice of experts, stopped serving egg yolk mayonnaise and replaced the white sheets, pillowcases, and blankets on the sleeper planes with green ones, with excellent results.

Not long ago, a hotel in Chicago tested the effectiveness of color. They invited some guests to dinner. The table was set with fresh steaks and vegetables, tempting hors d'oeuvres and desserts. Everyone had a good appetite, talking and laughing. Suddenly, the lights changed color, with a special light bulb emitting all the colors in the spectrum except red and green. As a result, the steak turned gray-white and the milk turned blood-red.

Within minutes, several guests felt like vomiting, and several others felt very uncomfortable. The banquet was immediately stopped because everyone had lost their appetite.

At a department store in Toledo, the employees' clothing was limited to black and navy blue, and everyone frowned. Later, the personnel department hired a new director who canceled this rule and encouraged female employees to wear clothes with more beautiful colors. As a result, the employees were much more lively and enthusiastic, the atmosphere in the company became more pleasant, and business improved a lot.

Color can also ward off mosquitoes. One expert says that if you hate mosquitoes, put a blue light on in the place where you don't want them, and the mosquitoes will all fly there. Put a red light on in the place where you are sitting, and the mosquitoes won't come. Insects often mistake blue light for the sky. Insects also know that red is a sign of danger and avoid it.

According to correct statistics, nightclub guests stay longer when playing under amber light than under other colored lights.

How many colors are there in the universe? No one knows. Theoretically, there could be ten million colors. Most people say there are thousands.

Color and music are quite similar. One excites the visual sense, the other excites the auditory sense, and both are a kind of vibration. And color is even more powerful, because most of our senses come from sight.

### Buying Rice Log

— Guochang

The rice in the rice jar was gone, and I couldn't bear to starve on an empty stomach, so I thought of going to Qiu's rice store to buy some rice.

From east to west, from south to north, I ran all over dozens of rice shops, all of which were empty. Helpless, I couldn't buy price-controlled rice, so I had to ask Mr. Zhang next door to lend me a dou of white rice temporarily, and I was ready to return it immediately when the rice store sold price-controlled rice.

Waiting! Waiting! The hungry people were dizzy and confused, unable to tell the difference between humans and ghosts. Finally, a bit of news came out, saying that price-controlled rice would be sold throughout the city. This should be such welcome news!

The next morning, I made a point of getting up early and hurried to a nearby rice store with my rice bag. The doorway was already crowded with hundreds of people. Shouts, cries, and curses were mixed together, creating a chaotic scene, but not a single policeman came to maintain order. Those who had bought rice couldn't squeeze out, and those who hadn't bought rice were still desperately trying to squeeze in. Among them, there were several friends wearing crooked hats and short shirts and pants who used their tall stature to force their way into the crowd. In just a few minutes, they rushed out again with rice on their backs. As a result of this shuttle-like rushing in and out, several piculs of rice ended up in the hands of these few people. Because I was weak and powerless, I could only sigh and return home staggering. But I had to return Zhang's rice. It would be embarrassing to delay it any longer. So, having already gone halfway, I turned back and was forced to make a black market transaction with the crooked hat friends, paying an extra thousand yuan per dou.

After returning Zhang's white rice, I had no rice for myself. Alas! Where is the people's price-controlled rice?

### Lingering Midstream

### Today's Shanghai Hospitals

— Fumin

I am very grateful to the reporter for thinking about the happiness of the public and taking the time to investigate the hospital business. I dare to share my humble opinion with everyone about hospitals.

What is a hospital business? Dr. Li Jian'an, a public health expert, said it most thoroughly: "Medicine is not a charitable undertaking, but a great construction undertaking." In the past, the general public thought that providing diagnosis and medication was the full extent of charitable responsibility, not knowing that the human body is the most sensitive and complex machine. To achieve the goal of health, it must be inspected and repaired at all times. Using only the previous diagnostic methods and drugs is clearly like comparing human-powered rickshaws with cars and airplanes. We all know that all means of transportation are the lifeblood of construction, and human health and maintenance are the foundation of construction. Therefore, the medical business is the construction of all construction. In other words, only with perfect medicine can perfect construction be achieved. This is the mission of medicine. As for running a general business, you can make a fortune, but not with medicine. Because once a patient recovers their health, they can use their talent and make many kinds of contributions to society and the country, while the hospital receives only some reasonable fees, and mostly service and sacrifice. Why is that? For example, if a hospital wants to buy a new X-ray machine for US$10,000, it will be delivered in one year. We all know that US$10,000 is currently equivalent to 26 million national currency. Calculating with the black market interest rate, it doubles every four months, so after one year it is 200 million yuan. Even when it arrives in Shanghai and is put into use, the income will definitely not exceed the interest. In other words, the people who benefit are the general public. After an examination, they can obtain health insurance. Early diagnosis and treatment opportunities save medical expenses. Early recovery of health then allows them to engage in production, day by day newer and newer, while the hospital's equipment becomes older year by year. This is just one example. The service and sacrifice of hospitals is generally visible, so aren't such equipment and work "humanity's compassionate boat"? According to my investigation, I know that a certain private sanatorium has long-term free patients who have lived there for several years. They do not pay any fees at all, from admission to discharge. In the past two or three years, there have been more than a hundred such cases, more than any other hospital. Also, during the "August 13th" Shanghai War, all surgical machines, X-rays, etc. were given to the wounded soldiers' hospital for rescue purposes. Also, during the period of Shanghai's fall, medicine was lacking, so a large-scale free X-ray examination for tuberculosis prevention was jointly organized by hospitals throughout the city, so as to penetrate deep into the people for popular treatment. Isn't this "saving all living beings"? At present, the general public is really hesitating. Once they are sick, should they take proprietary medicines, or should they see a doctor? In fact, it is not necessary. We only need to: (1) maintain normal health, (2) promptly perform vaccinations and various examinations, (3) know the source of the disease early, then we can treat it early and recover our health early. We advocate: a hospital should first serve society and second assist in promoting public health. But please take a look, which hospital is really heading in these two directions?

Finally, I want to state that the Gongji Hospital charges 35,000 yuan per day, and the Zhongmei Hospital charges 50,000 yuan per day, exceeding the fees of any private hospital. This is unavoidable. It is hoped that with the strength of society, we can assist hospitals in overcoming their difficulties, reducing fees, and benefiting the public!

### Strict Discipline

— Fang Shan

On the sixth of this month, this publication printed an article titled "After Reading 'Inferiority Complex,'" which expounded on the feelings after reading "Inferiority Complex." The author meticulously diagnosed that inferiority complex is an extremely serious "psychological illness." The conclusion was: "Sincerity, politeness, and amiability are necessary, but they must be appropriate, generous, and don't turn yourself into a pitiful lamb!" This is indeed a precious proverb, a targeted and effective remedy for "inferiority complex sufferers."

The author attributes the cause of this "inferiority complex" to "old-style family education," saying that this education "has always aimed to teach children to be rigid and constrained..." This is also an incisive and undeniable argument. However, at this time, the golden signboard of ordinary schools, set as a policy—actually "to attract a wide clientele"—the four large characters "Strict Discipline" are glaringly present before my eyes.

The signboard is, of course, also an advertisement. The beginning of this advertisement is often like this: "Our school's curriculum is serious, the discipline is strict, and it has gained the trust of social figures." As for the ending, the writer of the draft, with heartfelt sincerity, may even write something like "Young students, why not come and prosper!"

The so-called strict discipline is actually nonsensical. Because if there is a strict aspect, there should also be a lenient aspect. Can education really be divided into two categories: strict education and lenient education? In reality, in the minds of those skilled in education, there will never be words like strict or lenient. They only pay attention to how to enable students to receive intellectual enlightenment, physical training, and moral cultivation through a reasonable life.

Just like the difficulty in distinguishing the real from the fake of "Lu Gao Jian" and "Zhang Xiaoquan," schools all over the world hang up a signboard of "Strict Discipline." As a result, parents who generally yearn for "strict discipline" are at a loss, feeling a sense of sighing at the "sign."

The true believers and practitioners of the "Strict Discipline" doctrine, when the trick is exposed, can be pitifully reduced to only two methods: one is "scolding," and the other is "beating." (However, there is ultimately an "ultimate weapon"—"expulsion," but due to space limitations, it is regrettable that it cannot be discussed.)

To meet the standard for scolding, it must be to scold "until the dog's blood sprays," such as "You are all trash," "You are all hooligans," and so on. Exceeding the level of scolding is beating. To meet the standard for beating, it must be to beat the students until their palms are swollen. However, there are two restrictions on "beating": one is that it cannot draw blood, because even parents who are believers in the "Strict Discipline" doctrine will not be able to bear the pain when they see their children being beaten to the point of bleeding, which will affect the reduction of customers in the second half of the year; the other is that they cannot beat older and taller students, because they may resist, and your physical strength may not be able to be their "wrestling" opponent.

As for the time of scolding and beating, it is nothing more than when students are unwilling to respectfully listen to the hypnotic lectures in class, or when they dare to skate and throw balls in the only little space available at school after class, or... in general, your mouth, hands, and feet must not move rashly or thoughtlessly. You should be quiet, you should be civilized, you should follow the rules, and that's good. If you want to move rashly or thoughtlessly, I will beat and scold you. How dignified and great to be able to beat! But being able to scold also counts as some dignity and greatness. "Elementary school students in junior high school are indeed afraid of me," this is the triumphant song of a scolding master.

Children have just jumped out of the pit of "Fen-style family education," but immediately fall into the net of this "Strict Discipline" doctrine, complete with beatings and scolding. As a result, their self-esteem, creativity, are rarely spared from being damaged, weakened, or even completely ruined.

Brief Collection

### Planning is not Difficult, Implementation is

— Wuling Ren

The great Shanghai construction plan, in its preliminary stage, will expand the commercial district to Nanshi, and the intricate and maze-like narrow streets of Nanshi will all have to be demolished. Hankou Road will be widened to become a secondary transportation artery... I remember that not long ago, the authorities, merely to widen the surface of Boundary Road and Zhejiang Road, were inundated with petitions and complaints. If the great Shanghai construction plan is implemented, the situation will inevitably involve large-scale demolition of houses. Whether it can proceed smoothly is a question.

Looking at the weather forecasts from the observatory in the newspapers in recent days, it's like betting on big or small at a casino, betting big and it turns out small, betting small and it turns out big. Therefore, it makes people very suspicious. What day is being predicted? But to say that what the observatory publishes is completely unreliable is not necessarily true. I dare to guarantee that at least the temperature rise and fall reports are very accurate.

Up to now, it seems that match merchants have not yet loudly "cried for help," but I am afraid that the time is not far off. Look, doesn't everyone have a lighter in their hand?

A Miss who just flew in from Chongqing said repeatedly that she couldn't get used to living in Shanghai, and that Hong Kong has mountains and water and the scenery is good. But Chongqing also has mountains and water, so why is she unwilling to live there for a long time and insists on coming back every day?

The wife of the director in the Two Roads Bureau embezzlement case is said to still live in Shanghai and has repeatedly sent letters to the newspaper from this city to defend herself. I admire her courage. Is she not afraid of a household registration investigation?

The authorities stipulated that rice must be bought with a household card, allowing each person to buy five sheng. After that, everyone began to value their household card. "What is a household card?" Many people still don't know, isn't that ridiculous!

### Sent to the Deceased Wife Feng Jun (4)

— Zhou Shoujuan

The children stayed at home for a total of four days and nights, enjoying the joy of being around your knees, which added a lot of lively atmosphere. Seeing that your old woman's condition had not improved, although they were reluctant to leave, because they each had their own matters to attend to in Shanghai, they had to say goodbye to you repeatedly with care. Although you were very sad in your heart, you deliberately did not show it. You only repeatedly told them to be careful in everything outside, and sent them away with a forced smile. I knew that you were smiling on the face but in pain in your heart, so I used skillful words and gentle analogies to comfort you.

On the third day after the children left, I remember it was the fifteenth day of the third lunar month, this cursed day. In the peony altar on the lawn, more than a hundred *yulouchun* magnolias and more than twenty purple peonies were in full bloom, vividly colored and fragrant, pleasing to the eye. Early in the morning, I picked three *yulouchun* magnolias, arranged them in a vase, and brought them to the small table next to your bed. When you saw the pink-tinged flower faces and smelled the delicate fragrance, you couldn't help but light up with joy. Taking advantage of the special light when getting up to comb your hair and make the bed, you still went to sit on the veranda for a while, first leaning on the rattan armchair for a few minutes to rest your mind, then asking me to help you to the peony altar to admire the peonies, each striving for beauty and vying for splendor. When you saw that you were as thin as firewood and your face was haggard, you began to sigh "Humans are not as good as flowers," and then, sadly unhappy, you went back to the room to rest, taking two steps as if glued together. The situation this afternoon was not bad. Originally, you had a cup of milk powder at four or five o'clock, but today you wanted to eat porridge, and you even ate two small pieces of braised pork. At half past seven, you had dinner as usual, although it was only a shallow bowl of thin porridge, it was not reduced. I thought this was an optimistic sign, and my heart relaxed by half. But unexpectedly, at about eleven o'clock that night, there was a sudden change. I was sleeping very sweetly in the black sweet countryside when I suddenly heard Mother Ye, who was staying in the same room, exclaiming repeatedly, "What's wrong with Madam? What's wrong with Madam?" I was awakened by this burst of shouting and hurriedly straightened up from your feet and looked at you. I saw your eyes rolled upwards, foam coming out of your mouth, and humming "Ooh... ooh... ooh..." for a while. I quickly placed my two pillows under your back and helped you up, repeatedly calling out, "Feng! Feng! Wake up quickly! Wake up quickly!" After a while, Bao Mei, Mother Ye, and Lian Er Xi Sheng all put on their clothes and got up, rushing over from the next room. Then everyone cried and shouted, pulling at hair and twisting *renzhong* points in a flurry. After a good while of chaos, you still didn't wake up and were still humming "Ooh... ooh... ooh..." I was so flustered that I didn't know what to do except cry and shout. Bao Mei had an idea and quickly woke up Shijing and told him to go and invite Doctor Wu immediately. However, Doctor Wu replied that he did not make house calls in the middle of the night. I asked him to invite Doctor Pang, who had initially introduced Doctor Wu, thinking that he could ask him to make an exception to come and save you in an emergency out of friendship. But the doorman said that Doctor Pang had gone to the countryside. Seeing you lying stiff and unresponsive in my arms, I just cried and shouted, not knowing what to do. I couldn't think of a way, so I had to ask my resourceful old friend Cheng Xiaoqing for help. I was sorry to have him get up from his warm bed and rush over. He thought that having Shijing go to invite Doctor Wu was not solemn enough and that I should go myself. Perhaps Doctor Wu would take pity on me and make a trip. Fortunately, the rickshaw that Shijing usually rented was parked at home. So he pulled me to Doctor Wu's house. In a short distance, we arrived in a moment. Doctor Wu heard my voice upstairs but still refused to come down. His wife also helped to refuse. I was filled with grief and shouted hoarsely, "Fine, just watch her die!" Then I sighed deeply and walked out of Doctor Wu's gate in despair. After walking only a few dozen steps, unexpectedly, an imperial edict flew down from the high building. It turned out to be Mrs. Wu's soft Wu dialect, saying, "Wait a minute, let Doctor Wu take a look!" Overjoyed, I thanked her repeatedly and returned to the gate to wait patiently for a while. When Doctor Wu came out carrying his medicine bag, I couldn't help but kneel down on the threshold and kowtow to him to show my gratitude. Then, Shijing's rickshaw pulled Doctor Wu back, and I followed behind the rickshaw, panting and taking quick steps. The moonlight was very good that night. Although there were no pedestrians, I was not afraid at all. While chanting the Buddha's name, I also called out to Jesus, asking them to rescue you. At this point, my mind was already confused.

### How Xu Jie Criticized Shen Congwen

— Jiang Xingyu

For twenty years, Shen Congwen has always been like a scarecrow target, letting the arrows of criticism fly one by one, he rarely responds, his works themselves are the best response.

Political sectarianism has become the heaviest stumbling block on China's road to constitutionalism. In fact, this is not only true in politics, but sectarian and factional prejudices are even deeper in the literary world. If a writer does not have his own group, or even a small organization, then no matter how serious your attitude is, no matter how you have practiced the methods of realism, no matter how typical the characters you have created, you still cannot get fair treatment. In theory, realism is not a patentable commodity, and there should be no disputes over legitimacy, because it is a matter of creative method, and there is nothing to inherit. Although there is a great distance between Zola and Balzac, they are both naturalistic writers. The progress of modern material civilization is considerable, but it still has to rely on human thinking to produce literary works. In other words, since machines cannot manufacture stereotyped literature, realistic works will inevitably have diversity. Being able to render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, the initial task of literary criticism is completed. If you only see the trees and not the forest, it is indeed the most dangerous tendency. If a work has pornographic elements, the critic needs to point it out, but to rashly consider it a pornographic work and obliterate its value is tantamount to throwing out the baby with the bathwater, which is not the attitude a critic should have.

Mr. Xu Jie once wrote three articles in a row, criticizing Shen Congwen's "Looking at the Rainbow Record," "Picking Stars Record," and "Stupid People." We are prepared to discuss the first of these.

"Do you like to read pornographic literature, friends! Then, let me introduce you to the "Looking at the Rainbow Record" in the first issue of New Literature." This is how the criticism begins. Ancient Chinese philosophers said, "The benevolent see benevolence, the wise see wisdom." This is the most true truth, because objective existence is just that objective existence, constantly changing, but not changing according to our psychological state, but according to certain laws; we observe a thing at the same time, and the impressions and conclusions we get are not easily the same, because everyone's subjective is like a pair of colored glasses, so the benevolent only see benevolence, the wise only see wisdom. Mr. Xu Jie's soul is filled with pornography, so he can only dig up pornography in "Looking at the Rainbow Record." To put it bluntly, there is nothing mysterious about it. Freud, from the perspective of psychoanalysis, explains all human behavior as sexual behavior, which is the same principle.

Mr. Xu Jie clearly does not have a deep understanding of that subjective monologue in the novel: the so-called "I live completely in a concept, not in the actual world," this is not a question of whether the author wants to do this or not, but that in the situation of "spending this time gazing at the clouds," a person has such an illusion. In fact, people cannot but live in the actual world, and there is no such possibility as living in a concept. "Poetry and fire both make life burn" is just a metaphorical saying. The so-called poetry and the so-called fire are both abstract or symbolic. It can be abundant vitality, or it can be the emotions aroused by a certain image in the outside world that is rich in beauty or stimulation. If fire is lust, then what kind of poetry is poetry? Is the fire stolen by Prometheus also lust?

It is a mistake to confuse the physical body and carnal desires. Praise of the physical body is not necessarily praise of carnal desires. Under certain circumstances, the physical body can be an objective existence like a work of art. The person who praises it only praises it from an artistic point of view, appreciating its lines, appreciating its complete and very symmetrical outline, appreciating its profound expression or natural posture. A healthy body originally means morality itself, so it is not only the most beautiful but also the most good. Great artists of all ages, such as Michelangelo and Rodin, have all used the human body as a model and studied it throughout their lives, gaining various inspirations from it to complete their artistic cultivation and personal cultivation. Only the lowest and most vulgar people are aroused by carnal desires when they see the physical body. They do not have the psychological basis to appreciate the physical body, let alone imagine how others appreciate and praise it.

Since Mr. Xu Jie believes that "Looking at the Rainbow Record" is pornographic literature, he still takes the trouble to copy it down section by section. This criticism is actually an abstract, extracting the parts that impressed him the most. Although his attitude is negative, if "Looking at the Rainbow Record" is really pornographic literature, then he has become a promoter of pornographic literature. A type of medicine for quitting opium used to be popular on the market, which was said to contain opium, but with some flour added. If "Looking at the Rainbow Record" is really pornographic literature, the function of this criticism can at best be equivalent to that kind of medicine for quitting opium.

Shen Congwen's hometown, Xiangxi, was originally a place where the Han and Miao ethnic groups lived together. As far back as forty or fifty years before the Anti-Japanese War, the tentacles of modern civilization had not penetrated due to the obstruction of mountains and rivers. Life there was still inseparable from pine torches, fire sticks, shamans, yellow paper charms, and wild boar skin drums. There still remained a part of the primitive and medieval customs. He grew up in a mythical environment, and the invisible influence was great. He yearns for simple love, pursues pure spiritual harmony and physical pleasure. His thoughts and his outlook on life, although there have been slight changes, are generally quite close to Epicurus's hedonistic philosophy. If this point is ignored, studying Shen Congwen is a waste of time and effort.

Short Story

### White-Clothed Angel

— Zhongyuan

I almost forgot that I was convalescing in the hospital. I often chatted with Lishan from dinner until the quiet of late night.

However, Lishan finally went back first, to deal with her unfaithful "Flying Umbrella," leaving me alone, lonely, in a cold and desolate hospital room.

One pale cyan moonlit night, perhaps I was feeling bored? Standing by the window, gazing at the twinkling, shimmering sky, staring until my eyes ached, I then returned to the bed, turned on the bedside lamp, and was just about to go to sleep when, suddenly, there were a few soft knocks on the door.

"Come in!"

Thinking it was the old maid who came to recite "Amen" to me every night, I called out absentmindedly. But when the long, green-painted door softly opened, my eyes suddenly widened, and I saw a stranger!

However, the stranger could not be considered entirely unfamiliar, because she was wearing a white uniform and a white hat, the edge of the hat trimmed with a narrow black border. "Is she a newly arrived head nurse?" I thought, taking a step forward, nodding to her, and asking:

"May I ask your surname, Miss?"

"My surname is Xu. Don't you recognize me?"

"It seems I haven't seen you before. Perhaps I am just too careless," I said.

"No, you are not careless. You indeed have not seen me before. But I have known you for a long time. I have seen your photograph!"

"Really?"

Seeing her give me a mysterious smile, I couldn't help but feel a little surprised, and unconsciously took another step forward, carefully scrutinizing her.

It was a flat, round, ordinary face, with many red pimples amidst the slightly dark complexion, a slight bump in the middle of the nasal bridge, small eyes and mouth... not particularly beautiful, perhaps? But her figure was very petite and well-proportioned, neither too tall nor too short, neither too plump nor too thin, a belt tied around her slender waist, quite charming.

The hour was near midnight, the moonlight was good, and the pale cyan sky was very tranquil. I dragged a chair from the bedside to the window and invited her to sit. She was not shy and sat down.

Logically, I was a patient, and it shouldn't be surprising that a strange nurse came in to chat with me. However, at this moment, a cloud of suspicion suddenly surged in my heart. I felt that the nurse's attitude was somewhat strange. At the very least: she knew me; or perhaps, she had had some kind of relationship with me.

I felt my heart beating faster, standing in front of her, I was speechless.

"I already came to see you last night, but you were asleep," she said softly, after gazing at me quietly for a while.

"Hmm..."

"I only returned from Beiping last Saturday, but I don't plan to stay here for long. As soon as I have a chance, I want to go to the interior," she added.

I nodded, still not answering.

"Last night I saw your name on the patient's card, and I was unspeakably excited! It's such a coincidence that I finally saw you!" Saying this, she suddenly gave me another mysterious smile, and then fell silent, no longer speaking.

The night deepened. The strange nurse stared at me silently like that. Several times I felt I couldn't restrain myself and wanted to ask her frankly how she knew me, but somehow, when I met her mysterious and somewhat terrifying gaze, I felt a slight chill and dared not speak.

It seemed a very, very long time passed before she stood up and walked towards the door. As she was leaving, she handed me something and said:

"There is someone you know inside here. When you see him, you may understand who I am!"

She went out, taking away that mysterious and terrifying gaze. I closed the door and returned to the bedside lamp, discovering that she had handed me a small commemorative album.

Sitting by the bed, I curiously opened the album.

On the first page, I saw a delicate painting, depicting a pile of beautiful white clouds, with an angel in white standing on the clouds, stretching out her arms and looking down at the earth. In the right corner of the painting, there were two lines of small pen writing:

"Dedicated to my love, the white-clothed angel in my soul!"

My fingers began to tremble. When I saw a name under the two lines: "Meiqi", I finally realized that this strange nurse was Meiqi's fiancée, Xu Xiangying!

I did not continue to browse. I remembered a distant story:—

Meiqi—yes, he was just a fifteen or sixteen year old boy then, wasn't he? But very slick, always grinning slyly, squinting his small eyes, stealing glances at us in front of the low wall of the Xiguang Middle School next door.

"Us" of course, were all girls, some about the same age as Meiqi, some younger than him, and some older. Like those of us in Senior High School Class Two, who were at least three or four years older than him.

At that time, several of the older girls were very afraid of the male students from Xiguang Middle School, because they were very bad. Once they learned someone's name, they would write mushy, anonymous love letters. So, when we saw someone peeking from next door, we would immediately run away, never daring to look back.

But we were not afraid of Meiqi, not only were we not afraid, but we were also a little fond of him. The reason we were not afraid, of course, was because he was much younger than us. He was indeed still a child. The reason we were fond of him was funny. It turned out that Meiqi, although a boy, had a girl's face, a long oval face, watery little eyes, and especially lovely, when he smiled, a deep little dimple would immediately appear on his left cheek, with a resemblance to the movie star Hu Die's smile.

I don't know from when, one of our classmates, who liked to give nicknames, gave Meiqi the nickname "Little Flowery Eyes." So, whenever Meiqi stood by the low wall, grinning slyly, stealing glances at us, everyone would softly call out: "Little Flowery Eyes! Little Flowery Eyes!"

Once, the school had spring break, and most of the students had gone home, leaving only me and six or seven students from out of town. That day, a classmate and I were strolling idly on the street, and saw a boy standing in front of a fruit store eating loquats. The classmate softly called out: "Look, Little Flowery Eyes! Look at Little Flowery Eyes eating loquats!"

Perhaps we called out a little loudly, Meiqi turned around and smiled at us, and then walked away.

It was on the very next day that I received a strange letter, unsigned, only writing one sentence: "May I ask, Miss, why do you call me Little Flowery Eyes?" (To be continued)

Long Serial

### Flying Together as a Pair (82)

— Zhao Qingge

At first, Lihua did not agree, but Mrs. Mo and Zhang Xian repeatedly pleaded with her, telling her that this would offend the local people, which would be very unfavorable to their opera troupe. Helpless, Lihua only agreed to acknowledge some adoptive fathers, but absolutely refused to make friends. Mrs. Mo also felt that Lihua was still young and that it was not yet time to make friends, so she used this reason to reject those younger ones. Although the younger ones were inevitably somewhat disappointed, because the older ones were bodyguards for Lihua, they dared not do anything to her.

Now Lihua could no longer be as carefree as she used to be in Beijing. Before, she sang opera at night, and Bai Da could read and do needlework during the day; now, she sang opera at night; during the day, she had to go to this adoptive father's house today; to that adoptive father's house tomorrow; she simply had no life of her own! She often envied Liyun, who was still very happy, even though no one was supporting her, she didn't need it. She always naively treated singing opera as a game. She was "playing" opera, unlike Lihua, who always felt like she was being played, and she herself was someone else's plaything. Therefore, Lihua was in pain, but Liyun was not!

Lihua's adoptive fathers were all old men around fifty years old, either officials or merchants. Among them, there was only one who was relatively young, around forty years old. He was a brigade commander of the Northwest Army stationed in Xuzhou. Rich, powerful, and with many wives. The other adoptive fathers, after the adoption, also paid respects to the adoptive mothers. Because Lihua was born pretty, the adoptive mothers also liked her very much, so things were still peaceful. Naturally, when the adoptive mothers were not around, the adoptive fathers could not help but become wanton, secretly hugging Lihua, and fooling around with her for a while. But they still had some sense of propriety. Only this brigade commander adoptive father never introduced Lihua to his wife, and Lihua never knew that she had an adoptive mother. Moreover, he was more wanton and more hands-on than others, without any sense of propriety.
