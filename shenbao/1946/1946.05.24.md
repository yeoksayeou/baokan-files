### Blocking the Breach Near Kaifeng: The UNRRA Plans to Restore the Yellow River's Course; Dyke Restoration Project Limited to Completion by the End of June

[United Press International, Washington, 22nd] UNRRA Director La Guardia announced last night that UNRRA engineers are currently leading a dramatic effort to complete the closure of a one-mile breach in the Yellow River dike by July 1st, enabling the restoration of production on two million acres of fertile Chinese land. The UNRRA engineering teams are concentrating 100,000 workers, paid by the Chinese government and supplied with food by UNRRA, to return this major river to its original course. The dike was breached in 1938 during wartime to impede the advance of Japanese forces. With the flood season approaching, the urgent task is a race against time to close the main breach before July 1st. After July 1st, the river will overflow, and the project cannot proceed until after the flood season. This is UNRRA's largest-scale post-disaster relief plan. The project's chief consultant engineer, Dodd, stated in his telegram to La Guardia: "From an engineering standpoint, excluding other factors, this project can be completed in time. If we are fortunate, the flood season may not arrive until mid- to late July, but we cannot rely on this. We should aim to complete the project by July 1st." In accordance with the planned schedule and in cooperation with the Chinese Executive Yuan Relief Administration and other Chinese government agencies, UNRRA initiated the dike restoration project at the beginning of this year. The number of workers engaged in the massive breach closure project is steadily increasing, currently reaching 10,000. These workers are building earthen dikes, while another group is quarrying stone in the mountains not far from Zhengzhou. By July 1st, 160,000 people will be working on the 400-mile dike from Kaifeng to the sea, with 150,000 working near the main breach near Kaifeng, and another 2,000 working in the stone quarries. The final closure will be a rock-filled dike, reinforced with wooden piles. Each wooden pile will be driven 60 feet into the riverbed. Two giant pile drivers have been shipped by UNRRA from the United States. Then, a massive dike, approximately 50-60 feet wide and a mile long, will be built along the main breach. The dike will be reinforced with thousands of tons of rock and barbed wire to resist water impact. According to La Guardia, the difficulty of transportation and supply is no less than the actual engineering work. Thousands of tons of materials must be transported by narrow-gauge railway to the construction sites between Zhengzha and Kaifeng. The main materials must come from Shanghai, over 500 miles away. Currently, transportation is underway day and night to accelerate the delivery of supplies to the area. The breach closure and dike restoration project also includes the problem of large populations. Approximately 250,000 residents from 500 villages within the old course of the Yellow River have already been relocated, all within areas controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. These people must be moved before the breach is closed and the Yellow River flows into its old course. The Yellow River dike repair project by the Chinese government's Water Conservancy Commission will last for ten years. UNRRA is providing emergency technical and material assistance to rebuild and repair the 400-mile-long river dike from Zhengzhou to the sea to prevent continued flooding.

### Kizer Submits Report to UNRRA: Our Country's Famine Situation is Severe; 33 Million People Cannot Get Enough to Eat

[United Press International, Washington, 22nd] Kizer, the former Director-General of UNRRA's Shanghai branch, also submitted a report, announcing that China's food situation is deteriorating rapidly. According to UNRRA's latest survey, 33 million people are not getting enough to eat, of whom 7 million are on the verge of starvation. The last report UNRRA received from China stated that 30 million people were not getting enough to eat. Currently, the worst famine areas may be Henan Province. In addition, food is also insufficient in densely populated areas such as Hunan, Guangxi, Hubei, Jiangxi, and southern Guangdong. The crops in these provinces cannot be harvested for another 60 days, and even then, the harvest will be far below normal. Hunan is at the core of the famine zone and was the battlefield of the last major war against the Japanese army. Farmers, both men and women, are now personally dragging plows, as oxen were slaughtered almost entirely during the war. UNRRA has established six major porridge kitchens in the province, providing relief to 17,000 starving people daily, and has also established numerous small-scale porridge kitchens in remote areas, providing for several thousand starving people. These people are too weak to trek to larger cities to receive porridge. There is a porridge station in Hengyang. Famine has forced many people to steal. Infants abandoned by impoverished parents are piled up like mountains. Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Shanxi, Chahar, and Shandong provinces also have varying degrees of famine. If UNRRA's engineers win the race against time, the land freed up by the Yellow River bed can produce 20 million bushels of wheat before this winter.

### Our Country's Representative Pleads for Relief

[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] Today, at the Third Conference of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, our country's representative requested a fair distribution of food supplies to China. He stated that China has received less than 40,000 tons while requiring one million tons. Unless a large amount of assistance is obtained from abroad in the coming months, millions of lives cannot be saved. France proposed that the Economic and Social Council establish an International Trade Bureau to cooperate with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization to achieve a fair distribution of supplies. Czechoslovakia proposed establishing a World Food Conference, or that the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization be responsible, and utilize the secretariat and intelligence office of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization to specialize in the estimation of distribution. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department confirmed that Truman had sent a letter to Stalin, requesting Soviet cooperation to jointly solve the world famine. The White House will soon issue a statement regarding the Social and Economic Council consultations.

[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] A senior Chinese food official told the Associated Press today that, in fact, the effective measures taken so far to relieve the Chinese famine are the result of China's own efforts. China is transferring a portion of its domestic surplus of small rice grains to the areas most severely affected by the disaster. Although the wheat shipped from Australia is "barely sufficient," the rice allocated has fallen far short of the target so far. He continued that of the 115,000 tons of rice allocated by the United Grain Bureau, almost no grain was shipped to China in the second quarter of 1946. The rice received is still what should have been delivered in the last quarter of 1945 and the first quarter of 1946. Tian Pijiu's indictment was mentioned.

### Investigation Team in Hankou Collecting Evidence of War Crimes

Tian Pijiu's indictment was mentioned.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 23rd] The War Crimes Evidence Investigation Team of the Military Affairs Commission and the Executive Yuan arrived in Hankou yesterday. At 9:00 this morning, they convened a joint meeting of relevant agencies in Hankou. In the afternoon, the team split into groups to conduct investigations in various locations.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd] The military court prosecutor Cai Jin of the Guangzhou branch of the President's Headquarters concluded the investigation of Japanese war criminal Lieutenant General Izumi Pijiuichi, the former commander of the 23rd Army and the Governor-General of Hong Kong, who was the highest commander in South China during the war. He was indicted yesterday. The indictment listed his crimes: (1) Systematic acts of massacre and terror in the Taishan area, condoning soldiers to pierce the abdomens of children with bayonets and discard them. (2) Cruel killing of Chinese prisoners of war in the opening stages of the war, dismembering villagers alive. Wherever he went, villages were reduced to ruins. The crimes were numerous, the facts were clear, and the evidence was solid. The defendant's troops killing people not only violated the customs of war and offended humanity, but also violated Article 31 of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law. He was indicted according to law, and a public trial will begin within days.

### Wartime Relocated Antiquities to be Transported Back for Display

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 22nd] Ma Heng, the director of the National Palace Museum, will arrive in Beiping from Chongqing by the end of this month. Mr. Ma is currently handling the relocation of antiquities transported south during the wartime defense of the Great Wall. According to reports, there are over ten thousand boxes of antiquities, which were transported and stored in Anshun, Guizhou, Emei, Sichuan, and Leshan. Currently, the antiquities in Anshun have been transported to Chongqing, and the other two locations are also being consolidated. Upon arrival in Chongqing, they will be transported to Nanjing, and then plans will be made to transport them to Beiping for display.

### Garrison in Taiwan Begins Reorganization; New Organization to be Implemented Starting Next Month

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 23rd] The garrison in Taiwan is beginning to reorganize. The new organization will be implemented on the first day of next month. The garrison, originally consisting of two divisions, will be reorganized into one division, designated as the 23rd Army of the Army, with Li Liangrong as the army commander and Ke Yuanfen as the deputy army commander. The original 62nd and 70th Armies will be reorganized into the 62nd and 70th Divisions, respectively. The original divisions will be reorganized into brigades. The commanders of the fortresses have all been internally determined. After the reorganization, efforts will be made to perfect the new army's physique, academics, and equipment. Attention will also be paid to the surplus officers and soldiers, ensuring that no one is unemployed, and they will be allowed to return to their hometowns to farm or change careers according to their wishes.

### Three Charges Against Female Traitor Mo Guokang; Nanjing High Court Files Indictment; Investigation of Traitor Wen Zongyao and Others Has Begun

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 23rd] Recently, there have been widespread rumors that the execution date of traitor Chen Gongbo will be realized soon. Our reporter visited the president of the High Court, Sun, to inquire about this matter. He said that he had not received any news and that it was difficult to speculate. The reporter then asked if the execution site of traitor Chen would be moved to the Third Prison. President Sun replied with a smile: "The Second High Court does not have a fixed location for executing traitors. Moreover, a new execution ground has been opened inside the detention center. However, Chinese judicial proceedings are based on the principle of confidential interrogation, so I cannot express any opinion." Based on this speculation, it is more likely that Chen's execution site will be the new execution ground inside the detention center.

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 23rd] Female traitor Mo Guokang, the concubine of traitor Chen Gongbo, served as an editor in the puppet Legislative Yuan, a member of the Legislative Committee, and a counselor and director of the confidential office of the Political Security Bureau. After the victory, fearing punishment, she fled to Japan with traitor Chen. Upon central government order, she was detained and sent back to the country and escorted to the High Procuratorate of the capital for investigation. She was indicted on the 22nd. The indictment listed her crimes, which can be roughly divided into three points: (1) Serving in important positions in the puppet government's senior positions. (2) Revising the puppet law and agreeing to pass the Basic Treaty between China and Japan, the Joint Declaration between China, Japan, and Manchukuo, the Treaty of Alliance between China and Japan, and the Declaration of War against Britain and the United States. (3) Being in charge of the highest special service agency, spying on the Central Army's military intelligence, destroying anti-Japanese organizations, searching and arresting underground workers, and persecuting patriots. She violated Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. The prosecutor in charge of the case is Wang Wenjun, the former prosecutor of the Suzhou High Procuratorate. A copy was sent to the Suzhou High Court here from Beijing on the 23rd.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Mo Guokang, a concubine of Chen Gongbo from Panyu, Guangdong, is 37 years old this year. The High Court of the capital indicted her yesterday, and a public trial will be held at the beginning of next month. In addition, 28 traitors, including Wen Zongyao, the president of the puppet High Court, and Yang Choumei, the chairman of the puppet Water Conservancy Commission, have recently been transferred to the High Court by the military and have begun to be investigated.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 22nd] The Shanxi High Court again sentenced three traitors on the 22nd. Traitor Wang Yin and Traitor Tian Yuzhi were each sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for three years. Traitor Sun Honglie was sentenced to five years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for five years.

Editorial

### Chairman Chiang Flies to Shenyang

According to last night's telegram, Chairman Chiang and his wife flew to Shenyang yesterday afternoon, and the National Army entered Changchun at 11:00 AM yesterday morning. The Communist Army illegally disturbed Changchun for more than a month, and the citizens of Changchun welcomed the National Army entering the city again yesterday morning. Our northern compatriots, who have endured the pain of being occupied for fourteen years, were able to witness the Chairman's majesty yesterday. Moreover, Changchun has just suffered from the ravages of war, so they must have mixed feelings of sorrow and joy.

The people hope for peace, the government seeks peace, and friendly countries are also helping us to achieve peace. In particular, Chairman Chiang's benevolence and magnanimity have always believed in stopping war for the sake of peace. In recent years, he has consistently advocated resolving the Communist Party issue peacefully through political means. Central officials have been working diligently, and representatives of the Political Consultative Conference have been traveling around, all hoping to turn hostility into friendship. Now that Changchun has been recovered, the central government's personnel in charge of receiving the Northeast can return to work. We believe that as long as the Communist Party no longer uses its troops to disturb the region, and allows the central government to take over Harbin and the administration of other provinces in the Northeast, peace negotiations can be reopened immediately after the Chairman flies to the Northeast to inspect and comfort the people. The political situation can be cleared up once and for all. Therefore, the key to domestic peace in the future still lies in whether the members of the Chinese Communist Party are truly enlightened.

On the other hand, we also sincerely hope that the central government will always be tolerant and continue to give them a chance to reform and serve the country, even if the Communist Party often breaks its promises. As long as the Communist Party adheres to the agreements of the Political Consultative Conference and faithfully implements the ceasefire order, the central government should not hold the past against them and should quickly reopen the door to consultation. For the sake of the people and the country, peace is ultimately better than war.

However, we believe that consultations should have a firm and mutually agreed principle, which is "reasonableness." Consultations should be based on "reason," and should not be about perfunctoriness and seeking temporary security. Therefore, those who call themselves mediators should adhere to this principle of fairness, and then they can seek true peace.

Chairman Chiang's arrival in Shenyang, the recovery of Changchun, and the return of the Northeast to the embrace of the motherland should bring a ray of hope for the return of peace to the country!

### Concentrating Efforts to Solve Major Problems

— Xie Yunyi

Yesterday, our newspaper received many letters from readers, among which no fewer than eight or nine discussed prices—especially rice prices—and the treatment of public school teachers and military officers and soldiers. It is really impossible to publish them all. This reflects that these issues have already formed major problems that the government urgently needs to solve. It is impossible to continue to ignore them and drag them on with "due process." The repeated discussions of the salary increase for civil servants by the Supreme National Defense Council and the Executive Yuan, and the convening of a food conference by the new mayor of Shanghai immediately after taking office, all show that the central and local authorities do attach importance to these major problems. However, what achievements can be expected? Civil servants are still anxiously waiting, and rice prices are rising sharply and falling slightly. Yesterday, white rice suddenly jumped 3,000, and rice speculators are still eager to move. If the rise in prices does not stop for a day, the lives of the common people will be uneasy for a day. The treatment of public school teachers will not be able to keep up with the rising prices, and there is no way to talk about work efficiency.

On the day of the government's return to the capital, this newspaper had already said that the government must resolutely reform and start anew with the people. We once loudly called out: "It is better to put aside all new policies and first concentrate its efforts on stabilizing prices; it is better to save other government expenses and try to increase the salaries and benefits of military officers, soldiers and public school teachers as much as possible." We believe that if the government officials today still cannot see this, it is unwise; if they see it but have no way to solve these major problems effectively, it is incompetent; if they have indeed decided on a solution, but hesitate and procrastinate, and are unwilling to act boldly and decisively, it is a lack of courage to take on great responsibilities. It is necessary to know that today, those who are politically responsible should embrace the great courage of "If I don't go to hell, who will?" Therefore, if there is a solution, act quickly; if there is no solution, step down. The overall situation of the country has been dragged on to this day, and no one is allowed to use the "dragging" tactic to muddle through anymore!

Let us first examine the adjustment of the treatment of public school teachers and staff. The high prices and the poverty of public school teachers and staff, who are even struggling on the verge of starvation, is a fact that everyone knows. The public servants from the rear, coupled with the oppression of the housing shortage, even have problems with their sleeping arrangements at night, not to mention anything else. When the legislative Yuan's proposal to increase the salaries of civil servants by a thousand times was published in the newspaper, the prices went up instead of the civil servants receiving any benefits. This kind of publicity is harmful to them. Even if it is really going to be increased by a thousand times, regardless of whether the national treasury can really bear it, even if it can, then wouldn't the inflation and prices rise even more, and how much benefit can the civil servants receive? It can be seen that adjusting the treatment of public school teachers and staff is not a simple problem. However, no matter how complicated the problem is, we believe that the authorities should have a method of managing complexity with simplicity. Yesterday, the opinion of Mr. Gu Yangping in the letters from readers is worth paying attention to by the authorities.

Mr. Gu believes that the lives of civil servants must be saved, but where will so much money come from in today's empty treasury? Looking at the strikes and calls for salary increases, one wave has not subsided, and another wave has risen. Just as a compromise has been reached, prices have risen again, and the treatment needs to be adjusted again. In fact, the first step in adjusting the treatment is not in raising salaries but in seeking fairness. What we cannot understand at present is the unreasonableness and inequality of the treatment of civil servants. Civil servants in the same region or the same subordinate department have vastly different treatment. Just taking Shanghai as an example, civil servants in certain banks and bureaus have better treatment than other national agencies in Shanghai; the same subordinate departments, such as the China National Aviation Corporation, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Post Office, Railway and Highway Bureau, and Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, each have their own treatment, which is colorful and chaotic. Since the state has clear and unified regulations on the treatment of civil servants, why should it be so chaotic? If the treatment is determined according to the importance of the work and the size of the responsibility, it is exactly the opposite. It is said that the civil servants of the Telecommunications Bureau, which has the most difficult work and the greatest responsibility, do not necessarily receive higher treatment than others, or may even be lower. This makes you never believe what a high official with political common sense said, that agencies with more income can have better treatment, and agencies with insufficient income cannot improve treatment. According to this, civil servants from the five Yuans to the political agencies at all levels in various places cannot only not be paid, but also have to bring some money to subsidize the agencies! The country is not a business organization, so how can the amount of income be used for self-distribution? How can those who close the door to calculate their own gains do politics well? If a treatment problem cannot be achieved in equality and unity, can we expect other unity? Now all agencies can use the example of agencies with higher treatment to demand higher treatment, so that the heads of all agencies have no excuse to refuse. The cycle goes on and on, so that no civil servant is willing to work with peace of mind. Moreover, with the soaring prices and the rising demands for salary increases, how can we respond? This is the authorities' unfair treatment, and they are suffering the consequences themselves.

The facts mentioned in Mr. Gu's letter above should not be ignored by the high officials. We should awaken the vigilance of the great men who hold the national authority: in reality, it is not only a few powerful people who are promoting all the government affairs of the country and exerting political effectiveness, but these thousands of civil servants! If civil servants cannot live, how can they carry out politics? The fact that all the undertakings of the country are in a state of atrophy and paralysis, and that civil servants cannot have a stable life, is a major reason. Issuing banknotes indiscriminately and increasing the printing without limit is not a solution. Using high-pressure tactics and simply rejecting demands is not a solution. Dealing with things in a perfunctory manner, muddling through, and muddling through is even less of a solution. These are not only not solutions, but simply tantamount to government suicide. We do know that there are many civil servants who are wholeheartedly willing to serve the country and are willing to suffer for the country. They also understand that messing with the country is messing with themselves, and they will never make trouble without reason. The reason why there are so many problems and disputes now is because of the word "unequal"! Putting down prices, let's not discuss it for the time being today. We believe that the government officials should first concentrate their efforts at this time to handle the major problem of reasonable and equal treatment of public school teachers and staff, so that they can wash away the shame of the word "incompetence." It is also remembered that at the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee in mid-March of this year, the Executive Yuan proposed the "Economic Emergency Measures Act," which did stipulate the principles of adjusting the treatment of public school teachers, military officers and soldiers, and employees of state-owned industries, so as to achieve fairness and rationality, and also pointed out the methods. However, two months have passed, how is the adjustment going? Where is the fairness? Where is the rationality? What is the use of a proposal that is decided but not implemented! "I am not afraid of scarcity, but of unevenness!" If the government officials drag on to this day and cannot even use a sharp knife to cure the root cause of the "unequal" treatment, and cannot even achieve "unity" in the reasonable and fair treatment of public school teachers and staff, we really do not know what great things the responsible officials have concentrated their efforts on!

### Yu Hanmou Passes Through Shanghai and Goes to Beijing, Meets with Shen Honglie in Hangzhou to Discuss Zhejiang Security Plan

[This Newspaper Hangzhou, 23rd Telegram] Quzhou Pacification Commissioner Yu Hanmou arrived in Hangzhou on the morning of the 23rd and immediately visited Shen Honglie, Zhu Mingtao, and others to discuss the Zhejiang security plan. This newspaper's reporter immediately went to interview him. He informed us that the people urgently need to recuperate and rebuild, so security must be maintained. All scattered bandits will be strictly suppressed. All troops under the jurisdiction of the Pacification Commission will be reorganized in accordance with central government laws and regulations. Surplus officers and soldiers have also been properly resettled, and the entire process is expected to be completed by the end of this month. In terms of transportation, special commissioners have been dispatched to inspect various important locations and consult with local governments to repair them immediately. After the demobilization of the Youth Army, other troops will take over the defense. There are very few Japanese war criminals remaining in Zhejiang, so it is not planned to set up a separate military tribunal; they will be directly transferred to Shanghai for trial. The issue of military rations will be handled by the Pacification Commission itself. Mr. Yu attended a banquet hosted by Chairman Shen at noon, and at 3 PM, he took a special train to Shanghai. After staying for one day, he will go to Beijing to report to Chairman Jiang and make some requests.

Shen Honglie Speaks

[This Newspaper Hangzhou, 23rd Telegram] Zhejiang Chairman Shen Honglie convened a meeting of Zhejiang silk industry leaders on the 23rd to discuss preventing the suppression of cocoon prices. He also met with reporters and shared his observations from his inspection tour of eastern Zhejiang, saying: "It took ten days to inspect fifteen counties. A military conference was held in Quzhou to discuss security, transportation, and military ration issues with Pacification Commissioner Yu. Commissioner Yu provided a lot of assistance, and an agreement has been reached. Although the district administrative conference was very short, the counties had prepared quite thoroughly in advance, and the discussions were mostly frank and open. County finances are difficult, and civil servants and police cannot be adequately paid. After the people have suffered so much, they are further burdened with trivial matters such as grain levies, which makes them even more impoverished. In the counties I visited, except for Chun'an and Jianxi counties, which had relatively intact houses, the rest were scarred. In the future, we can only start with reconstruction. This year, the rainfall in eastern Zhejiang has been evenly distributed, and a good harvest is expected. The cooperation between the party, government, and public opinion organs is very good, which is very gratifying."

### Building Nanjing

— This Newspaper Beijing Correspondent Mao Shukai

Because the Northeast could not be smoothly received, and the political situation in North China could not be stabilized, some people suspected that Nanjing, as the capital, was too far to the southeast, and feared that it could not take care of the vast north. They suggested moving the capital to Beiping, hoping to suppress the restless situation in North China and the Northeast. They even cited historical evidence, saying that establishing the capital in Nanjing was a temporary measure of parochial peace, while Beiping was a foundation for ten thousand years. For a time, there was turmoil in Chongqing, and the Fourth National Political Council even passed a proposal to move the capital. However, soon the facts proved that our government rejected all dissenting opinions and resolutely returned the capital to Nanjing. The debate over the issue of moving the capital also disappeared with the mountain city's tides.

Now that Nanjing is the location of our national capital, it is evolving from a local city into the nation's political center and an international metropolis. It is the focus of Chinese and foreign attention, so all municipal administration and construction must not be simplified. The Chairman pays the most attention to the construction of the capital. A huge sum of 600 million yuan was allocated at once to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works to repair roads. After returning to the capital, the Chairman came out to inspect almost every day. In one week, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works received twenty handwritten instructions from the Chairman, specifying which road surfaces to repair, which roads were too narrow, which vacant lots to build houses on, and which houses to demolish. Even the smallest things were noticed by the Chairman. Nanjing is moving towards a goal under the Chairman's supervision and the efforts of the municipal government and all citizens. I believe it will not be difficult to successfully build a great and perfect modern city in the shortest possible time.

After returning the capital on May 5th, the entire city of Nanjing was full of vitality, showing a new vigor everywhere. No one can remember that someone wanted to abandon her a month ago. The traces of war are gradually being diluted by this new vitality. Now, in Nanjing, wherever you go on the road, you can always smell the scent of paint and bricks and earth. Everywhere you can see carts of bricks and wood being hauled in front of you. The number of construction companies is increasing one by one, and they are still overwhelmed. Carpenters, painters, and electricians are gathering from all over, more and more every day, and they are still too busy. Nanjing is in a construction frenzy.

Smart businessmen are not willing to easily let go of this opportunity. They clearly see the future commercial value of Nanjing. They understand that the large number of middle and high-ranking civil servants and their families, the resident representatives of various agencies and commercial firms in Beijing, foreign envoys and dignitaries, as well as people from all walks of life who come to Beijing to handle official business, all have strong purchasing power and are their basic customers. At the same time, the beautiful Xuanwu Lake in the suburbs of Bai Xia, the quiet Jiming Temple, the clear and beautiful Yanziji, and the solemn and magnificent Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum will attract millions of tourists. The wide roads and numerous open spaces along the roads are superior conditions for commercial development. If the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is laid with double tracks, with a train arriving and departing from Shanghai every two hours, then Nanjing's commerce will develop immeasurably.

Even with the extreme shortage of materials after the war, the government is still proceeding with the construction of the capital according to plan, step by step. Before the war, the area south of Zhongshan North Road in Xiaguan, west of Huimin River, east of the Yangtze River, and north of Sanwu River was designated as the first industrial zone, and roads, embankments, and other infrastructure were planned. However, due to the war, it was not implemented. However, this area is surrounded by water on three sides, and the area is very limited, with a total area of only over 900 acres, which is not enough to meet future needs. Therefore, the recent municipal meeting also approved the designation of the area around Caoxie Gorge, Jinling Township, Tiger Mountain, and Elephant Mountain along the Yangtze River as the second industrial zone, in order to establish light industries such as textiles, chemicals, and food. Because it faces the Yangtze River, ships can reach it directly, and railway branch lines can also be extended into the area. The municipal government also plans to connect the main roads in the area with the main roads in the urban area, so that land and water transportation will be convenient. After this plan was announced, businesses and industries inquired with the municipal government about the procedures for leasing land in the industrial zone and the municipal government's management regulations for factories in the zone. Zhang Jianming, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, and Zai Zhonglu, Chief of the Department, who are responsible for the design and construction of the industrial zone, told me that the construction of roads, sewers, pumping stations, embankments, dams, and other projects in the industrial zone can begin as soon as the Executive Yuan approves it, and it should be completed within two years.

The geographical situation gives Nanjing too many superior commercial conditions. If Hankou becomes the center of heavy industry in our country, then Nanjing will undoubtedly be the central station of economic and trade between Shanghai and Hankou. If the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway is successfully laid with railways, then Nanjing will become the distribution center for goods from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. These are all predictions that can be realized in the short term. Nanjing will gradually develop from a political center to an industrial and commercial center.

Although the population of Nanjing has surged and consumption has increased since the return of the capital, and many new shops have appeared, the entire financial sector is still stuck in a primitive stage. If we want to develop commerce, we still need the assistance of outside manpower. We also hope that the surplus speculative capital and talent in Shanghai will quickly withdraw from the "end of the road for heroes" speculative market and jointly develop this barren land. Nanjing is eagerly expecting you.

Songjiang Quan Jie Tang Will Not Be Dissolved

The directors of the Songjiang San Shan Tang had a resolution to dissolve the Quan Jie Tang [Widow's Refuge]. The widows, due to livelihood problems, sought help from all circles in Songjiang. Elders such as Shen Lichu, Lu Guiliang, and Yang Yunquan, on their behalf, appealed to the Shan Dong [Charity Directors] requesting that the proposal to dissolve the widows' refuge be postponed. It is now supported by various Yi Dong [Benevolent Directors]. It is heard that the gentry in Songjiang generally advocate that the original funds and property of the hall should still be used to carry out the original charitable事業 [business/project] at the original address, and that the widows staying in the hall should work diligently to generate profits. The Shan Dong and Shen Lu and other elders are cooperating to plan reform matters.

Bank of China to Establish a Songjiang Sub-Treasury The Central Bank, in view of the fact that the National Bank of this county has not yet been established, has specially set up a sub-treasury to facilitate receipts and payments.

Rice Prices Skyrocket, Organize Rice Relief

The rice price in Hangzhou City has been greatly impacted by Shanghai and has risen sharply in the black market, selling for more than 60,000 yuan. The people's food adjustment committee stipulates that the selling price of each rice store is only 47,500 yuan, and each person is limited to two dou [a unit of volume, about 2 gallons]. However, there are many people who carry and transport rice on a small scale, and people are panicked. The city government and all sectors of society held a meeting to discuss and decide to organize a cheap rice sale, with a price of 36,000 yuan. Each extremely poor household can buy two sheng [a unit of volume, 1/10 of a dou] per day, limited to 200 shi [a unit of volume, about 133 pounds] per day. Rice purchase certificates are printed and distributed to poor households by the district offices. Starting from the 23rd, fifteen rice stores in the urban area will be designated to sell rice, and bank groups will provide loans to rice merchants to continue purchasing rice from various production areas to adjust the people's food supply.

Hefei

Huinan Road, Shui-Beng Section Opens to Traffic

The Huainan Railway was built to transport coal produced by the Huainan Datong mines. After its construction in the 22nd year, passenger and freight transportation developed rapidly. Unfortunately, the Anti-Japanese War broke out, and it fell into enemy hands. By the winter of the previous year, the entire road from Jiulonggang to Yuxikou was dismantled and rebuilt from Shuijiahu to Bengbu Railway. After the victory was achieved, the enemy wantonly destroyed the mining area, and many bridges along the road were also destroyed by the Communist Army. After the mining area was taken over by the central government, coal production only reached one-third of what it used to be. The Shuibeng Road was also closed again. It is heard from the road personnel that the monthly deficit is 2 billion yuan. Recently, the mines have been repaired and the bridges and roadbeds along the line have been rebuilt. The project has now been completed, and after a smooth test run, passenger tickets will be sold on the 20th, and traffic will begin.

### MacArthur's Headquarters Orders Deprivation of Japanese Imperial Family Privileges; Cessation of Stipends; Most Basic Income Completely Cut Off; Imperial Relatives Will Also Have to Find Jobs in the Future

[Reconstruction Society Tokyo 23rd Telegram] MacArthur's Headquarters today ordered the deprivation of privileges and exemption from obligations for the fourteen major imperial family members of the Xian Yuan, Zhi Fu, Gao Song, San Li, Li Ben, Zhu Tian, Zhao Xiang, Fu Jian, Dong Fu Jian, Shan Jie, Jiu Yun, Dong Jiu Qian, Bei Bai Chuan, and He Yang families. All securities deposited by princes, kings, and queens with the Ministry of the Imperial Household will be returned to the depositors immediately and taxed in accordance with regulations. The Ministry of the Imperial Household is also restricted from providing princes, kings, and queens with funds or property or lending funds to them. The Ministry of the Imperial Household is prohibited from employing people to serve them. At the same time, their rights and interests to all property of the Ministry of the Imperial Household are also deprived. The assets of these imperial families are estimated to be over 50 million Japanese yen. At the time of the armistice, 8 million yen in securities were deposited in the Ministry of the Imperial Household's treasury. According to today's order, although the funds can be reclaimed and used, all other stipends received from the Ministry of the Imperial Household are prohibited. With the exception of specific imperial family members of the Japanese Emperor who are not restricted by MacArthur's order this time, the basic income of most imperial relatives and nobles has been completely cut off. In addition, the imperial family's property has always been exempt from taxation, but now this privilege has been abolished, and the imperial family's property has also become subject to taxation, which will greatly affect their future lives. In the future, they will have to go to the streets, join the common people, and find a job. Some imperial family members may be demoted to subjects.

[French News Agency Tokyo 23rd Telegram] Marshal MacArthur ordered today to prohibit Japanese Emperor Hirohito from subsidizing his brothers, uncles, nephews, and other imperial family members of fourteen households with 2 million Japanese yen annually. The Japanese imperial relatives and nobles will no longer burden the national treasury. However, the various imperial families will not be impoverished, because they still have more than 50 million Japanese yen in private property.

Hirohito Scheduled to Broadcast to the Japanese Today

[United Press Tokyo 23rd Telegram] Japanese Emperor Hirohito will broadcast to the national public three times tomorrow at noon, 7:00 PM, and 9:00 PM, perhaps because a large number of hungry people recently gathered in front of the Imperial Palace, asking him to distribute food. The Ministry of the Imperial Household is unwilling to announce in advance what Hirohito will say, but it can be predicted that the content must be very important. We have reason to believe that Emperor Hirohito will probably ask the Japanese people to tighten their belts, abandon the party struggles that have become public disputes, and cooperate to seek national revival.

### Britain's Harsh Terms for Egypt; Treaty Revision Negotiations Stalled; Egypt Determined Not to Accept Incomplete Independence; British Delegation to Return Home for Instructions

[This Newspaper News] London, 23rd Broadcast: The British delegation to Cairo for negotiations will return to England tomorrow. The delegation denied that the negotiations had failed. It is said that the return to England is to ask Bevin for instructions and report to the House of Commons.

[United Press Cairo 22nd Telegram] The Egyptian delegation held a meeting for three hours tonight. Representative Markley told reporters that the Anglo-Egyptian treaty revision negotiations have almost stalled. We cannot accept incomplete independence.

[United Press Cairo 23rd Telegram] A senior Egyptian official said today that the proposed new Anglo-Egyptian treaty proposed by Britain contains several military clauses that make it difficult for Egypt to accept. The treaty revision negotiations have been temporarily suspended because the British representatives still need to ask the government for instructions on the disputed points in the treaty. It is heard that the British representatives have asked Egypt for various guarantees, which, from a certain point of view, are actually more harmful than occupying Egypt. Britain has recently allowed the withdrawal of all troops stationed in Egypt, but the issue of the withdrawal date is still under discussion.

[Reuters London 23rd Telegram] The British government has made it clear that the Egyptian government should be held responsible for the assassination of two British soldiers by Egyptian mobs on March 4th. Foreign Minister Bevin replied to inquiries from Conservative MPs yesterday that the information obtained by the British military authorities has been forwarded to the Egyptian government, urging it to take action, but the Egyptian government has not yet initiated any expression of respect.

### Indian Muslim League Leader
### Raises Three Minimum Demands
### Warns Britain to Use Force if Necessary for Resistance
### British Side Clarifies the Status of Various States Before Indian Independence

[Our News] London, 23rd (Radio): Although Jinnah has already issued a declaration criticizing the British proposal, the Standing Committee of the Muslim League did not issue a statement as generally expected after its meeting today, and will discuss it again tomorrow.

[Agence France-Presse, Simla, 22nd] Jinnah, Chairman of the Indian Muslim League, recently gave a speech here expressing disappointment that the British Cabinet Mission to India refused to accept the "Pakistan Plan" advocated by the Muslim League. He stated that Pakistan is the only condition for resolving India's constitutional problem. The British Cabinet Mission to India, in order to satisfy the Congress Party, even rejected our party's demands. We must warn the British government that Indian Muslims, when necessary, will resort to armed resistance. We hereby put forward the following three minimum demands: (1) Divide the provinces of India into two independent groups, one being the six-province Muslim group and the other being the Indian group. (2) A federation consisting of the Indian and Muslim groups, with its powers limited to foreign affairs, national defense, and transportation. (3) The federal system will have a "probationary" period of ten years, during which both the Indian and Muslim groups will retain the right to secede.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 23rd] The British Cabinet Delegation yesterday sent a memorandum to the President of the Chamber of Princes of India, clarifying that before India's complete independence, the original relationship between Britain and the various states of India will be maintained, that is, Britain will still be the supreme authority of the more than 570 states of India. This relationship is stipulated by treaties previously signed by the British King and the various princes. According to these treaties, the various states have no right to foreign relations, and their internal affairs are also restricted depending on the extent to which they have ceded power to the supreme authority. People from the various states are under the protection and control of the United States when they leave the country. The laws of the British Indian government are not effective in the various states. The area of the various Indian states is 700,000 square miles, accounting for two-fifths of the Indian peninsula, with a total population of over 90 million.

Soviet Commentary: The British Plan's Check Has Not Been Cashed

[Reuters, London, 23rd] Moscow yesterday issued its first commentary on the British Cabinet India Plan. Commentator Yakov, in English, broadcast on Moscow Radio yesterday that although the British government declared its willingness to grant India independence, this plan does not even grant India the status of a dominion. At the same time, it is known that India's police force has been strengthened, prisons have been expanded, and British troops are still maintaining their original strength. From this, it can be seen that the Indian Provisional Government will definitely not have true sovereignty. The plan announced by Britain this time is the same plan that was rejected by the Muslim League and the Congress Party at the Simla Conference. If we only examine it on the surface, we can know the unreasonableness of the plan. Although Lord Lawrence said, "India is willing to be independent, we should grant it independence," this check has not been cashed.

### Security Council Decides to Keep Iranian Issue on Agenda

[Our News] London, 23rd (Radio): Iranian Azerbaijani newspapers are fiercely criticizing Iranian Ambassador to the United States, Ala, calling him an "Iranian traitor" and saying that Ala is engaging in anti-Soviet propaganda under the instigation of "imperialist reactionary masters." The newspapers demanded that the Iranian government immediately recall Ala and punish him.

[United Press, New York, 22nd] The United Nations Security Council today re-discussed the Iranian issue. After Iranian Ambassador to the United States Ala expressed doubt as to whether Soviet troops had completely withdrawn, the Council decided to refuse to withdraw the case and keep it on the agenda indefinitely, to be discussed again at any time if any national representative requests it. The Polish representative proposed sending a telegram to Sadana, asking him to reply with a simple "yes" or "no" regarding whether he was personally satisfied with the Soviet withdrawal situation. The Council also rejected this proposal by a vote of eight to two.

[United Press, New York, 22nd] According to well-informed sources: the U.S. State Department has received reports confirming that all Soviet troops have withdrawn from Iran.

[Reuters, London, 23rd] A large-scale Russian-language broadcast last night stated: A delegation of "important cabinet members of the Azerbaijani Republic," at the invitation of the Iranian Prime Minister, has departed for Tehran. The delegation will investigate the Iranian government's military attacks on the Azerbaijani border.

### A Third World War Is Not Inevitable

Stettinius Delivers Speech

[United Press, New York, 23rd] US Representative to the United Nations Security Council Edward Stettinius today delivered a speech at the National Academy of Social Sciences, saying that the idea that a third world war is unavoidable is ridiculous. The achievements of the past two years have proven that effective cooperation between large and small countries for the cause of freedom and peace is possible and necessary, and there is no doubt about this. Effective cooperation does not necessarily require complete agreement and absence of disputes. In fact, agreement, which is essential to every human endeavor, requires both of these qualities.

[Our News] San Francisco, 23rd (Radio): US Army Air Forces Commander General Spaatz today declared to reserve personnel that the new B-36 bomber can carry atomic bombs for a distance of 10,000 miles. The US Air Force will maintain a force of 500,000 regular personnel. This will determine the security of the United States. After the war, US bomber speeds will be 600 miles per hour. In this atomic age, the United States cannot defend its homeland without a strong air force. Starting in July, the United States will actively train the air force at forty bases. One year later, the number of training bases can be increased to ninety.

[US Information Service, Washington, 22nd] A State Department spokesperson confirmed the news from London today, saying that the Soviet Union had requested the abolition of the Allied control commissions in the Balkans and said that the United States had agreed in principle and requested the Soviet Union to submit a draft of its proposal, but the draft has not yet been received.

Connally also asked, "Who gave the four powers this power?" Connally continued, "The power to conclude peace treaties lies with all the countries that fought against the enemy. I oppose the four foreign ministers drafting peace treaties and then submitting them to the peace conference, and I oppose any foreign minister being able to exercise a veto when the treaties are returned to the four foreign ministers for review."

### Mrs. Luce Says: Communism and Democracy Are Incompatible

Republican congresswoman Mrs. Luce (i.e., the wife of Luce, publisher of Fortune Magazine, Time Magazine, and Life Magazine) replied, "Communism and Democracy are truly incompatible."

The dialogue between the two took place at a broadcast radio exchange. Foster also said that reactionaries gloat and are happy to see atomic bombs dropped around the world.

Mrs. Luce replied, "Why not ask Uncle Joe to drop the Iron Curtain and let us go in and see what is happening. What in Russia is he afraid freedom of the press will expose?"

Foster replied, "The exclusivist power of the United States is the reason for the current tensions in the United Nations."

Mrs. Luce asked Foster if he had ever criticized any of Stalin's actions since 1939.

Foster replied: Soviet policy has always been consistent.

Mrs. Luce said: It is completely meaningless to accuse the United States of imperialism. The Soviet Union's participation in the war was only because it had been attacked by Germany. But before that, Germany and the Soviet Union had sworn an oath of alliance. Mrs. Luce also accused Foster of being disloyal to the United States and loyal to an anti-religious system. She would rather die than live under this system.

### Mayor Wu Resolutely Vows to Punish Corrupt Merchants!
### First Action Against Rice Market: One Person Arrested, Fifty Million Dollar Bail Demanded, Strict Investigation Conducted
### Aims to Achieve Results in Shanghai in Six Months
### "宁得罪极多数人" (Would Rather Offend the Vast Majority of People)

[Our News] Mayor Wu, accompanied by his wife, attended a welcome reception hosted by the Tsinghua Alumni Association last night and delivered an important speech, providing a resolute and frank explanation on food, labor unrest, and municipal administration. The gist of the speech is as follows:

The situation in Shanghai has always been extremely complex. I am taking on a heavy responsibility, but I am truly lacking in talent and knowledge. Therefore, I do not want to say much about policy guidelines, because I am afraid that I will not be able to deliver on my promises in the future, only to disappoint the citizens. However, today I am happy to gather with alumni from my alma mater, and I cannot help but speak. I know that in the future, my fellow alumni will be able to provide valuable suggestions at any time and in any place.

The most important thing in municipal administration is to seek the soundness of the internal organization. However, there are too many pressing problems in Shanghai that need to be solved. Therefore, I had to weigh the importance and give up one in favor of the other. The most important issues in Shanghai today are rice and grain, labor unrest, and municipal efficiency. The price of rice in Shanghai has soared from over 40,000 to over 70,000 in ten days, entirely due to speculation and hoarding by corrupt merchants. Therefore, I considered this issue even before taking office. On Monday, I took office at 9:00 AM, and I notified the rice merchants at 8:30 AM, summoning an emergency meeting. Shanghai rice merchants have 500,000 dan of rice in storage, and the public has 300,000 dan in storage. This total of 800,000 dan is enough to meet the city's needs for three months. The so-called lean months are only June, July, and August. If we can get through these three months, the new rice harvest will come in, and there will be no problem with the source of rice. When I was in Nanjing, Minister Xu of the Ministry of Food told me that he had ordered 90,000 tons of rice from Brazil, and it was already on its way. Even if there is a problem with the source of rice, we only need to sell these 500,000 dan, and at least the Brazilian rice can reach Shanghai. Therefore, there is no risk of interruption of rice supply in Shanghai. I know that even though I have strictly ordered the suppression of speculation, corrupt merchants will inevitably remain active in the dark. Therefore, in addition to ordering the Social Affairs Bureau to send personnel to monitor the markets, the municipal government is also secretly dispatching officers to pay close attention. Today, we discovered someone deliberately raising market prices. Sellers were willing to sell at 51,000, but they deliberately shouted that they were willing to buy at 53,000. At 3:00 PM, this person was arrested, required to pay a 50 million dollar bail, and had their entire accounting books investigated. If this person is indeed a speculative corrupt merchant, then this person will be used to prove my determination to severely punish those who manipulate and hoard goods. They may still see me as an old bureaucrat, but I have received education from Tsinghua and have been sent abroad by the country to study. If I do not act with conscience, I will be letting down the country and Tsinghua.

As for the labor unrest problem, the situation is indeed very serious. The reason why Shanghai factories prospered in the past was because of the extremely low wages. But currently, wages are so high that they have even exceeded those in the United States. The welfare of workers must be considered, but we must adhere to the principle of sharing the same boat in times of adversity and find a simple and effective solution. Detailed countermeasures are still under consideration, but those who want to eat eggs cannot kill the hen that lays them first. If all the factories cannot produce, the welfare of the workers cannot be discussed.

In terms of other general municipal aspects, I deeply admire the high efficiency of the Shanghai Municipal Council. After our country has achieved victory, we should not only not be inferior to them, but we should also make even greater progress. However, the situation in Shanghai is so complex that it will take at least six months to achieve some results, and it is impossible to avoid offending many people. But I have received education from Tsinghua, and I will work hard even if it means "offending people, I am not afraid." Alumni are like brothers, and I hope that every alumnus will show me their opinions on municipal administration at any time. This is what I hope for.

### Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters
### Four Additional Committee Members Appointed
### Mao Zipei Returns to His Original Position

In order to strengthen the party affairs in Shanghai and improve work efficiency, the central authorities have expanded the number of members and appointed Mao Zipei, Chen Baohua, Zhou Xuexiang, and Li Kui as party committee members. They will take office soon. Mao Zipei was originally a member of the party committee, but last year, because he served as the director of the Fourth Bureau of the Social Affairs Bureau, he had no time to take care of it, so he resigned from the party committee. Because the authorities deeply trust him, they have ordered him to return to his old position in order to achieve the effect of strengthening the party's management.

Once verified, the installation will be carried out immediately, and legitimate merchants will be entrusted to sell the water at a fixed price, to facilitate drinking and emphasize public hygiene.

### "Breach of Faith" Consumer Cooperative Accuses the "Administrative Relief Committee"

[Report from our newspaper] According to information from the Shanghai Consumer Cooperative: The cooperative previously applied to the "Administrative Relief Committee" for the purchase of 5,000 bags of affordable flour, priced at 6,000 yuan per bag. The Finance Department of the "Administrative Relief Committee" sent a letter to the cooperative, instructing them to pay and collect the goods at the designated bank. Upon receiving this document, the cooperative believed that a "sales contract had been established" and proceeded to pay the bank and obtain the warehouse receipt according to the regulations. However, the "Administrative Relief Committee" repeatedly delayed delivery and ignored the requests. Recently, the "Administrative Relief Committee" refused to fulfill the delivery obligation, citing an order issued on March 21st to suspend sales as the reason. The cooperative believes that the "Administrative Relief Committee" initially delayed delivery and then used the excuse of an order to suspend sales, and will therefore accuse the "Administrative Relief Committee" of breach of contract.

The reporter then inquired about this matter with a person in charge of the "Administrative Relief Committee," who stated: The cooperative had previously applied to the "Administrative Relief Committee" for the purchase of flour, and the "Administrative Relief Committee" responded by referring to the flour purchase method published in the newspapers at that time, instructing them to pay and collect the goods at the designated bank. The cooperative failed to make the payment within the stipulated time. By the time the payment was made, the method for bulk purchase of flour had already been suspended, and the "Administrative Relief Committee" was unable to make an exception to sell the flour. The "Administrative Relief Committee" only sent a letter to the cooperative informing them of the flour purchase method, and did not enter into any sales contract with the cooperative.

[Report from our newspaper] In the Taoyuanfang lane, 150 North Jiangxi Road, an elderly Cantonese woman, Tan Feng, over seventy years old, had a son named Xi Li, forty years old, who suffered from a mental illness.

The neighbors reported to the Hongkou Police Station. Criminal Investigator Yan Chang and an officer went to investigate and took the parricidal son back to the branch for questioning.

### Overdue Registration Fees Temporarily Waived, Director of the Land Administration Bureau Zhu Ping Implements New Policies

The offices and departments of the Municipal Land Administration Bureau and the Land Registration Offices simultaneously conducted handovers yesterday. Applications for registration from property owners were still accepted as usual and were not affected by the handover. In order to reduce the burden on property owners and accelerate the completion of land registration, Director Zhu will reduce or waive various administrative fees. For example, the fee for land title deeds was originally set at a minimum of 100 yuan and a maximum of 10,000 yuan per document. This has now been changed to a minimum of 2 yuan and a maximum of only 100 yuan per document. Furthermore, the Bureau began charging a 10% overdue registration fee starting on March 19th of this year, and an additional 20% starting on May 19th, totaling 30%. Director Zhu believes that while it is regrettable that property owners have failed to apply for registration within the time limit, it is also due to unavoidable circumstances, as transportation has not yet returned to normal since the victory of the War of Resistance. Therefore, in order to encourage property owners to quickly complete registration, the originally scheduled overdue registration fees will be temporarily waived to alleviate the hardships of the people.

### Three Thieves Rob a Household, Losses Amount to Tens of Millions

[Report from our newspaper] At 376 Yongjia Road, the homeowner, Mr. Wang, was visited by three thieves at around 9:00 AM the day before yesterday. The thieves used a sand-filled fire extinguisher to force open the back door, entered the house, and two of them brandished handguns, herding the men and women in the house into one room, where one of the thieves guarded them. The remaining thief forced Mr. Wang to hand over the key to the safe, and proceeded to loot the house, stealing approximately fifteen taels of gold, a small diamond ring, and US$5,000 in bills, for a total loss of approximately 40 to 50 million yuan. The three thieves then fled. The homeowner reported the crime to the police station and requested an investigation.

### Labor Disputes Rise and Fall, Labor-Management Negotiations Break Down Repeatedly, Candle Shop is Destroyed, There are Still Problems with the Tramway, Aviation and Electricity Industries Request Adjustments

[Report from our newspaper] A labor dispute has also arisen in the city's candle industry. Mediation was attempted at the Social Affairs Bureau at 2:00 PM yesterday, but no result was achieved. At around 7:30 PM, workers suddenly stormed into the Renchangzhai Candle Shop (established by Huang Yong-chuan, executive director of the Candle Industry Association) at 498 Nanjing Road, next to the Hong Miao Temple, destroying display windows, candles, light bulbs, and other items, causing significant losses. At 5:00 PM, the Xinyuanfeng Candle Shop (established by Tong Yuan-xiao, chairman of the Candle Industry Association) at 588 Zhongzheng East Road was also stormed and destroyed by workers. Upon receiving the report, the Lao Zha Branch Bureau dispatched a large number of police officers and patrol teams, led by Branch Director Shi, to suppress the unrest. More than a dozen workers involved in the incident were arrested on the spot and taken back to the bureau.

Tramway: The British-owned tramway has now fully resumed operations, and tramcars on all routes have resumed service. Regarding the workers' request for a loan of 100,000 yuan, Mr. Wu Kai-xian and Mr. Zhu Xue-fan will be responsible for handling it within the next few days. The cancellation of the increase in employees' base salaries and the restoration of the annual seniority-based salary increase method are still subject to negotiation with the employer. However, a new difficulty has now emerged, namely, the workers' demand that all wages be paid in full for the period of the strike, which has not been agreed to by the employer, and the General Labor Union believes that there is no precedent for this. How this issue will be resolved remains unknown.

Aviation: Ground personnel and mechanics of the China National Aviation Corporation, with monthly incomes of only 110,000 to 120,000 yuan, which is insufficient to cover their expenses, have requested the authorities to adjust their compensation. Office workers of the company also share the same sentiment. However, the company has stated that its current fare revenue is limited, and its current expenses already result in monthly losses, so it is unable to further adjust compensation. It is heard that if the Chinese employees of the company do not receive a response regarding the adjustment of compensation today, they are likely to take action.

Telecommunications: All employees of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau and the International Radio Station, under pressure from their living conditions, jointly petitioned the authorities yesterday to promptly improve their compensation. The bureau's employees, considering the importance of the telecommunications industry, are maintaining operations while simultaneously petitioning, and are not resorting to strike action. It is heard that the bureau's director, Bing Jian, and the station's chief engineer, Lu Yucheng, traveled to Nanjing last night to request instructions from the transportation authorities.

Tailoring: The labor dispute in the tailoring industry has been resolved through the mediation of Mr. Zhu Xue-fan, and the workers have decided to resume work today and await a reasonable resolution.

According to the Customs Administration Office of the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River, the Navy's Second Fleet Command announced that the mine had been removed on the 15th of this month, and all shipping companies have been notified.

### DDT: Beware of Counterfeits, Exposing the "Foreign Mirror," Many Fake Products on the Market, Labeled as "American-Made" Cause Great Harm, Chemical Analysis Reveals it is just a Bottle of Kerosene

[Report from our newspaper] The people of Shanghai, living in pigeon-hole-like houses, have long suffered from mosquitoes, bedbugs, and fleas. Now, upon hearing that DDT, with its insecticidal power, has arrived in China from the United States, it is like "scratching an itch," and it has been immediately welcomed by the masses.

Bottled in golden-yellow American-style beer bottles, with exquisitely designed labels stating that they are products of a certain American pharmaceutical factory, and claiming that the DDT content is above 10%, the bottles are neatly and brightly stacked on the stalls selling "American-made equipment" on Sichuan Road, the Bund, Zhongzheng Road, Lloyd Road, Albert Road, and Linsen Road. Tobacco shops and small pharmacies have also joined the bandwagon. The price ranges from 1,800 yuan to 2,500 yuan per bottle, and some even offer a free sprayer. The people of Shanghai are eager to kill insects and also love novelties, so everyone buys a bottle, and DDT has become extremely profitable and popular.

However, clever Shanghainese, you have been deceived! The reporter purchased ten samples of DDT from various places and sent them to experts for chemical analysis. The results showed that nine out of ten of these self-proclaimed American products are fake. Some are simply kerosene, and only one or two bottles contain DDT, with a content of only about 3%. As for the American factory names, most of them are fabricated, and some even have spelling and grammatical errors. The genuine American DDT powder is not yet widely available in the market, and even official institutions are experiencing shortages, so how can it be widely sold in the market!

It must be said again that the people of Shanghai have heard too much about the promotion of DDT, and only know how great its ability to kill insects is, but do not know its details, so it is no wonder that they are being deceived en masse. The reporter is here to provide some common sense about DDT for readers' reference.

DDT Common Sense

First, pure DDT powder is very difficult to dissolve. Even in kerosene, it can only dissolve up to 5%. The common fakes that claim to contain 10% are false advertisements.

Second, DDT itself is colorless and odorless, so its solution cannot be distinguished by sight or smell alone, unless it is sent to an expert for chemical analysis.

Third, DDT does not kill insects instantly, but once insects come into contact with DDT, they will be poisoned, then paralyzed and die. Flies and mosquitoes die within about half an hour. Bedbugs take several hours to die, and cockroaches take about a week to die.

However, the greatest benefit of DDT is that its insecticidal persistence is very long. The best DDT can maintain its insecticidal power for about six months. Although DDT is harmless to humans, food and vegetables are best not sprayed with DDT. In particular, liquid DDT should never be sprayed near stoves or kitchen ranges to avoid causing fires.

So, is there no real DDT in this city? That is not entirely true. Fortunately, several well-known Chinese-owned pharmaceutical factories are also imitating it. According to chemical analysis results, the effectiveness is also very good. Clever Shanghainese, please do not blindly believe in those self-proclaimed American DDT products, as these domestic DDT products have some effectiveness and composition of DDT. If you don't want to be fooled, please look for the trademark when you buy it. (Photo shows the sale of DDT on street stalls and in tobacco shops, taken by Yu Chuangshuo of this newspaper)

### Counterfeiters Will Be Severely Punished

[Report from our newspaper] Recently, it has been discovered that counterfeit DDT drugs are being sold on the market. According to the person in charge of the Food and Drug Testing Institute of the Health Bureau, all new drugs, regardless of type, must be registered with the Health Bureau. There are over a hundred types of DDT currently flooding the market, none of which have been formally registered, which is a fundamental violation of regulations. Those who counterfeit and reduce the quality of materials to deceive citizens will be strictly investigated and punished. DDT is an external medicine, and its danger is relatively small. However, the harm to citizens caused by the sale of counterfeit internal medicines on the market is not insignificant. On the one hand, we will crack down on them, and on the other hand, we hope that citizens will pay attention.

The institute has received ten types of DDT purchased from stores and stalls on the market by the Medical and Pharmaceutical Administration of the Health Bureau for chemical analysis. After the testing is completed in a week, the results will be reported to the authorities. If counterfeiting is found, a formal lawsuit will be filed in court or investigated jointly with the police station. All other types of DDT will be sampled and tested one by one to prevent unscrupulous merchants from harming the public.

### A Batch of US Navy Landing Craft are Ordered to be Transferred to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, A Total of Four Vessels Were Received Yesterday and Today, Will Operate on Coastal and Yangtze River Routes

[Report from our newspaper] A batch of landing craft from the US Navy, including 15 LSMs and 10 LSTs, have been ordered to be transferred to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The company was ordered to receive LSM 112 and 248 yesterday. The Shipping Department notified in advance the receiving procedures: (1) All captains will have lunch at the Bureau (i.e., the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company) Room 503 at 1:30 PM (yesterday). (2) Depart at 1:30 PM, the crew of 112 will gather on the Flying Shanghai Ferry. The crew of 248 will gather on the National Capital Ferry. (3) Receive 112 first, then receive 248. (4) At 1:55 PM, the US military will read the handover order on 112, and the Bureau's representative will read the receiving order, and the national flag will be changed at the same time. (5) After the receiving is completed, receive 248, and the same procedure will be followed. (6) Receive the LST tomorrow (i.e., today). The same procedure will be followed. Numbers 804 and 929 will be presided over by Huang Muzong, Director of the Shipping Department, in person. 112 has been renamed Hua 101, with Captain Shen Jichun, First Mate Lu Shengfen, and Second Mate Huang Zhenchun. 248 has been renamed Hua 102, with Captain Xi Pixun, First Mate Zhang Yanduo, and Second Mate Huang Chaoyou. Vessel 929 is Captained by Lu Xiaomin, First Mate Shi Tinghuai, and Second Mate Sa Shihong. The landing craft, including 15 LSMs, each displacing over 1,000 tons, will be dispatched to the Yangtze River route. The 10 LSTs, each displacing approximately 3,000 tons, will be dispatched to the coastal routes. The Bureau was previously ordered to inspect the US landing craft in Little Luzon. Yan Hongfu was sent to investigate. A telegram has now been received with details, but it is heard that the ships are scattered in various ports, and it will take a long time to inspect them. They will not be able to return to Shanghai in the short term.

### Hu Xiyuan Discusses that Tax Regulations Enacted During the Emergency Period Should Be Abolished, and Attention Should Be Paid to Fair Tax Standards

[Report from our newspaper] A reporter specially visited Mr. Hu Xiyuan, a leader in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles and general manager of the Asia Electric Factory, yesterday to inquire about his opinions on the matter of Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles requesting the government to abolish various tax regulations enacted during the emergency period and to exempt various emergency tax revenues for the 34th year of the Republic. He stated that various tax revenues enacted during the emergency period were originally laws to increase revenue during wartime, and should be abolished from this year onwards. As for the exemption of various emergency tax revenues for the 34th year of the Republic, Mr. Hu stated that he had only been in Shanghai for two months and was not fully aware of the financial situation in the recovered areas. However, for industrial and commercial circles in the rear areas, a portion of the various emergency period tax revenues for the government in the past year have already been paid, and the war lasted until August of the past year, so most of it still belonged to the emergency period. Therefore, there is no fundamental objection to the government collecting various emergency tax revenues for the past year. As for the Guangfu area requesting exemption due to complex circumstances, it is a special exception, and Mr. Hu did not express an opinion on this. As for simplifying the tax collection issue, Mr. Hu advocated striving for silence as much as possible. For example, during the period when the capital was in Chongqing, the authorities often used the previous year's losses as the standard for estimating the tax revenue for the current year, which seems unfair. Furthermore, representatives from the majority of industry associations should participate in the valuation and provide more opinions to make the valuation fair. The integrity of the investigators sent out by the direct tax bureau should be strictly monitored. If corruption is discovered, it should be severely punished, and the victims should be allowed to report the facts confidentially without disclosing their names.

### The House of the Industrial and Commercial News Agency Was Forcibly Occupied, Requesting a Stop to the Occupation

In order to protect its legitimate right to residence and for safety, the news agency has submitted a request to the garrison commander to effectively stop the occupation.

### Chen Guoquan, Head of the Puppet Rice and Grain Control Association, Tried; Greasy-Haired and Not Admitting Guilt; Discovery of Conscience: Lao Yinyu Expresses Shame

[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Guoquan, the head of the puppet Rice and Grain Control Association, used the name of "control" to carry out monopolistic practices during his tenure. He bought rice and grain at low prices, causing the bankruptcy of rural areas in the occupied territories and making it difficult for the people to eat. Therefore, the High Prosecutor's Office charged him with conspiring with the enemy, supplying and selling, and purchasing, handling, and transporting rice grains. Chen, a traitor from Zhongshan County, Guangdong, is 57 years old, but he is neatly dressed in a Western suit with shiny hair, still resembling a bank manager. According to his confession, he joined the puppet regime entirely because of the invitation from the traitor Tang 潄民, and he was forced to take office. It was an unavoidable situation. During his tenure in the puppet position, he did his best to fight for rice and grain for the citizens of Shanghai and did not commit treason. After a detailed inquiry in court, the judge adjourned the hearing for further interrogation.

Lao Yinyu

From Kaiping, Guangdong, 37 years old, studied in Japan and graduated from the Economics Department of Tokyo Imperial University. He knew the great traitor Chen 君　. He joined the puppet organization in 1940 and successively served as the secretary of the puppet Economic Committee, the director of the Shanghai Office, the director of the Shanghai Office of the puppet Construction Department, the price appraisal chief of the puppet Industry Department, and the director of the puppet Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau until the victory. According to his confession: "I am truly ashamed to say that I was careless for a moment and was pulled into the water by others. Although it was not for promotion or wealth, but just for survival, I always felt sorry for my conscience, so I voluntarily accept legal sanctions." The judge rebuked, "You studied abroad at public expense for many years. How could you bear to join the puppet government after returning to China!" Lao confessed, "After returning from Japan, I went to Hong Kong to open a bookstore, but the business was bad and I closed it down at a loss, so I came to Shanghai." After the judge asked about his factory work, he answered each question accurately, and the judge adjourned the hearing for further interrogation.

Sun Yunzhang

From Hangzhou, 47 years old, served as a civil servant for many years before the war. During the Anti-Japanese War, he came to the furnace and was instructed by Fu Shishuo. In the spring of 1940, when the traitor Wang Jingwei organized the puppet government, 潄逆 was the head of the puppet Ministry of Railways, and Sun served as the secretary of the ministry. When Fu was transferred to be the chairman of the puppet Zhejiang Provincial Government, Sun was transferred to be the secretary-general. The following year, when the organization was reorganized, Sun became the director of the puppet Department of Political Affairs. In the spring and summer of the following year, he also served as a member of the puppet Central Economic Committee, loyally promoting the credit orders of the puppet regime until the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. Sun stubbornly denied the crime when the trial began.

Ma Suiliang

From Jiangyin, 34 years old, after the Anti-Japanese War, he served as a staff member of the Third Hall of the puppet Investigation and Statistics Department, managing the registration of personnel organization for two years. Later, he served as the leader and deputy leader of the investigation team in Kunshan, Changshu, and other places. Under the command of the puppet agent Wang Lishi Qun, he specialized in killing, sabotage, and arresting patriotic people. After the victory, he was arrested by the military authorities and sent to the High Court for legal proceedings. According to his statement, the department had four halls: General Affairs, Intelligence, Organization, and Supervision. The special agent affairs were handled by the Special Agent Headquarters, so he cunningly argued that he was only a clerical staff member and was not responsible for the crimes he was accused of.

Wang Genyuan

A freight car worker at the Qishuyan Machine Factory, he served as a road management policeman at the puppet Qishuyan Station in July 1944, extorting employees and travelers, which was extremely bad. After the victory, he was jointly reported by the employees there. However, the defendant refused to admit the crimes he committed. The above three cases were also inquired in detail, and the hearing was adjourned for further interrogation. The defendants were remanded in custody.

### Ministry of Education Orders This Year's Graduates to Continue to Temporarily Suspend Joint Examinations

### Citywide Students Launch Teacher Respect Fundraising Movement on a Regular Basis; Private School Teachers Request Issuance of Teacher Respect Money

[Local News] The Municipal Education Bureau previously contacted leaders from all walks of life to launch a teacher respect movement. Although there has been considerable progress in the past month, it is still far from the goal. Therefore, the fundraising movement of middle and high school students in the city is launched again. It is now scheduled for the 27th and 28th of this month, from 8 AM to 6 PM, when student fundraising teams will solicit donations from various stores. The method is that each school has at least one team, each team has four groups, each group has four people, responsible for donation books, donation receipts, and other duties. After the donations are collected, the Education Bureau will repay bank loans and allocate funds to municipal school teachers and some extremely poor private school teachers. It is also reported that private school teachers and students in the city are also enthusiastically participating to promote the spirit of love and mutual assistance. The principals of each school are scheduled to go to the Education Bureau in the next two days to collect donation books, receipts, and other items.

[Additional News] All members of the Shanghai Primary School Teachers' Union and other three groups recently saw in the newspapers that municipal school teachers will receive 40,000 yuan in teacher respect subsidies, but private school teachers were not mentioned. This is inconsistent with what the Director said last time: "When municipal schools issue the second subsidy or teacher respect money, private school teachers will receive the same treatment." The group and others requested to send representatives Ge Zhicheng, Wang Luzhi, etc., to bring a petition to visit the Director for inquiries. The Director was away on official business, and Director Zhu received them on his behalf. When the representatives asked, Director Zhu replied that the municipal schools' current teacher respect money is based on the amount of teacher respect money donated by each school. The largest amount is 40,000 yuan, and the smallest amount is 5,000 yuan. As for the teacher respect money raised from outside, it has not been used, and after the teacher respect movement ends, the teacher respect money must be distributed equally to public and private school teachers, and the amount issued by the municipal schools will also be deducted.

### The Second Act of the Big Four Basketball Tournament: Xi Qing Defeated by Signal; Lianghua Defeats Shantou Team Last Night; Lingjie Tongfa Team Defeats Reporters; Tan Jing Generously Donates 500,000 Yuan Yesterday

The second act of the Big Four Championship Basketball Tournament continued at the City Stadium last night. Before the game, there was a subplot of reporters against the Lingjie (Performing Arts) organization's Tongfa team. The total audience was more than 2,000 people, and the situation was still enthusiastic.

At 6 o'clock sharp, the reporters and Tongfa first took the stage. Tongfa's Zhang Chunfu opened the scoring with a free throw. Reporters Zhang Guochun and Cao Zhengwei made two shots and led 4-1. Li Zongyi and Zhao Zongzheng repeatedly made great contributions. In the first quarter, Tongfa came from behind with 11 to 8. In the second quarter, Wang Weijun and Qian Xuchang of the reporter's team were very active, but at the end of the first half, the reporters were still behind with 19 to 22. After switching sides, reporter Zhou Jun showed his skills and scored repeatedly. At the end of the third quarter, the reporters exceeded with 35 to 33. In the last quarter, the competition became more intense, resulting in three ties. As a result, each team got 40 points and shook hands and made peace.

Following that, in the championship game, Signal vs. Xi Qing, Xi Qing led by two points with 20 to 18 at the end of the first half. Signal reversed the defeat with 39 to 33 at the end of the game.

In the final showdown, Lianghua vs. Shantou team, Lianghua's Shen Yukong showed his power from the start, scoring twice. Li Zhenzhong scored two consecutive goals. Lianghua's momentum was very strong. Tang Baokun was fouled five times and was eliminated when the score was 18 to 10. Liu Fushan replaced him. Shen Yukong was still comfortable and broke through the basket again and again. Shantou team's Lin Weicong and He Lide also gained something. At the end of the first half, Lianghua took the lead with 25 to 17.

During the break, Liu Hesheng reported that Mr. Tan Jing, director of Donghua Association, had generously donated 500,000 yuan. In addition, the organizer announced that 56 honorary seats were sold for 10,000 yuan per ticket, 761 tickets were sold for 2,000 yuan, and 462 tickets were sold for 1,000 yuan, for a total income of 2,544,000 yuan.

The two teams fought hard and made progress and retreated from each other. Soon Lianghua's Ge Ke also fouled out and graduated. Wu Bixian entered the arena. Lianghua adopted a slow tactic. Chen Qingjiang of the Shantou team gradually entered a good state, 23 to 29, only six points apart. The performance after entering became more tense. In the last minute, the Oil Team chased to 37 to 39. At this time, the battle situation had become fierce. Lianghua Geng Zhong skillfully passed to Bixian, who happened to be under the basket and scored a reverse hit, thus establishing the victory. Lianghua won two games and two victories with 41 to 37.

### American New Invention: Braille Typewriter

Can Write 140 Words Per Minute

[US Information Office Boston Report, 22nd] The Christian Science Monitor recently stated that Dr. Peng Tenkeks of San Diego, California, has invented a pocket-sized Braille typewriter. After training, blind people can use this typewriter to record 140 words per minute. The Monitor stated that this Braille typewriter is being prepared for mass production. Each typewriter weighs only 18 ounces and can be hidden in a man's overcoat pocket or a woman's purse. It is also equipped with a narrow tape, which is sufficient for several hours of recording. Dr. Penkes said that there are at least 72,000 blind people in the United States, and he estimates that 60,000 of them can learn to use this Braille typewriter. He also reported that although this new invention has not been heavily publicized, he has received more than 1,000 letters from all walks of life in the United Kingdom and South America, preparing to order this typewriter.

### National Taiwan University

— Yang Naifan

The predecessor of National Taiwan University was Taipei Imperial University during the Japanese colonial period in Taiwan. It has a history of more than forty years since its establishment. Because Japan regarded Taiwan as a base for its southward advance, and NTU was the main camp for researching the southward policy, the Japanese spared no effort in operating the university. Its professors were all top-notch experts from Japan. The campus has more than twenty grand Western-style buildings, and the library has more than 500,000 books. Other mechanical equipment, specimens, and instruments are also substantial in content, far surpassing those of other universities in our country. The affiliated Southern Resources Research Institute, Tropical Science Research Institute, Southern Language Research Institute, and other institutions, from the standpoint of supporting Japan's southward policy, are particularly characteristic of the school.

The school is divided into six colleges: Liberal Arts, Law, Science, Agriculture, Engineering, and Medicine. Except for the College of Medicine, which is located in Dongmen Town in the central area of Taipei, all other departments are in Shuidao Town in the suburbs. In the past, the total number of students was more than 1,200, with less than 200 Taiwanese students. Moreover, more than 150 of these 200 were medical students, with only a few distributed in the Colleges of Agriculture and Engineering because the Japanese did not allow Taiwanese to study advanced academics. Now, the Japanese students have all been sent back. The remaining students, excluding the College of Medicine, total only 29 in all other colleges. Because very few people have come from within the country, the professors have no choice but to keep the Japanese professors. It is truly a miracle that such a well-equipped, large-scale school has neither students nor faculty.

In the final stages of the war, Taiwan University also suffered severe bombing. All the glass windows of the entire school building were destroyed, and some houses were pierced or had leaks. In addition, due to the chaos that occurred after the Japanese surrender and before our government took over, the loss of school equipment, instruments, specimens, and the like was quite significant. Theft by petty thieves was also quite serious. We saw several large cabinets displaying animal skeletal specimens, all of which were extremely valuable. The Japanese staff in charge, unable to care for them, posted a note next to the cabinets, which roughly said: "The items in the cabinet cannot be sold for money on the market. Please do not take them away." This is another miracle.

In the past, Taiwan's education system only had four years of middle school. To enter university, one had to take two years of preparatory courses. Therefore, NTU established a preparatory class, which now has 492 students.

Taiwan's scenery is beautiful, life is stable, and Taiwan University has excellent facilities. At the same time, post-recovery Taiwan needs a large number of talents for construction. If many ambitious young people in Shanghai are interested in developing abroad, then trying to apply to Taiwan University during the summer vacation is a very good option.

### Answering Readers: Medicine and Health

(1) Yang Yitao asks: I have long admired your newspaper's enthusiasm for public welfare and benefiting the people. I am deeply grateful. My younger brother has become acquainted with a girlfriend and their feelings are very strong. However, she suffered from lymphatic tuberculosis (commonly known as scrofula) on her neck four or five years ago. Initially, she mistakenly trusted a village doctor to perform surgery, which was ineffective. Later, she was cured by exposure to sunlight. Now she is healthy as ever, and her lungs have also been X-rayed with no problems. I implore you to answer: (1) Can it recur in the future? (2) If they marry, will it be hereditary to their offspring? (3) Is it still contagious? (4) What methods of recuperation should be taken in the future to completely eradicate the root cause?

(Answer by Dr. Yu Xinen): (1) If you take good care of yourself, it should not recur. (2) There is no direct heredity. (3) If the X-ray of the lungs is clear, then it is not contagious. (4) Do not work too hard, pay attention to nutrition, and live a healthy lifestyle.

(2) Zhang Meiying asks: I am seventeen years old. Hard nodules have been growing on my neck since two years ago, i.e. scrofula. I have six or seven nodules now, and repeated diagnoses have been ineffective. I am suffering greatly. I have long admired that your newspaper is sold all over the world. I do not know if there is any fundamental cure in the world. Because I am a girl, my family is poor and I have no father. I rely on my mother to make ends meet. I hope that wise people will tell me. I am extremely grateful.

(Answer by Dr. Yu Xinen): You need to be irradiated with deep X-rays. The Municipal Fourth Hospital (No. 142 North Sichuan Road) in this city has this equipment. We can introduce you to go there for diagnosis and treatment.

(3) Liu Zhe asks: (1) My mother is fifty-one years old, and her head often shakes involuntarily (commonly known as shaking head madness). (2) Her hands, face, and arms often develop red, extremely itchy patches when exposed to wind or cold water. What diseases are these two symptoms? Are there any special needles and medications? Please advise.

(Answer by Dr. Yu Xinen): (1) The disease is called convulsions. You need to find the source of the disease. If it is in the central nervous system, you can try taking brain-calming agents or performing spinal nerve transection surgery, which is sometimes effective. (2) The disease is called urticaria, which is caused by stimulation. You need to avoid cold wind and cold water stimulation.

(4) Qiu Zhenzhi asks: My younger brother is 26 years old, married, and studying in the interior. For the past six months, his eyes have often had many blood streaks in the whites of his eyes. If he works a little longer, they turn red and feel dry. He also sees black shadows from time to time. Also, on both sides of the black pupils of his left eye, there are pterygia. Please provide details on the name of the disease, the treatment method, and the consequences of delayed treatment.

(Answer by Dr. Yu Xinen): A detailed examination by an ophthalmologist is required. If it is a pterygium, it can be surgically removed.

Suggestions for the Respect Teachers Movement

Editor: Enthusiastic people in this city, considering the recent difficult living conditions and the meager salaries of teachers in various schools, have established organizations such as the Respect Teachers Movement to raise funds from all walks of life to improve the lives of teachers, so that educators can be content in their positions and students can receive excellent teaching. During this period of national financial strain, we, as citizens, should be happy to donate to see it succeed. I have two points to make: First, the fundraising units seem too complicated. Yesterday, a friend and I met a student from a private girls' school in a teahouse who came to raise funds. The receipt they issued was printed vaguely and the amount was filled in carelessly (written in pencil without leaving a copy). Knowing that the visitors were all enthusiastic students, I still felt that the procedures were too simple, which inevitably made people suspicious. Second, various private schools are collecting the second installment of tuition and miscellaneous fees. According to my children's report yesterday, 70-80% of the children in the whole school have had to drop out of school because they cannot afford the fees due to their poor families. The first point involves personnel matters, but the result at least hinders fundraising success and affects teachers' income. The second point is indeed a social problem. I think that there are many private schools in Shanghai, and there must be many schools with the same situation as my children's school. Isn't it too pitiful that school-age children drop out of school halfway through? I have long admired Mr. Editor's service to the community and enthusiasm for public welfare. For this point, I hope you will speak out and ask the local education authorities or philanthropists to provide effective assistance, at least to request the private school authorities to make special accommodations for these students who cannot afford the second installment of tuition fees, and allow them to continue their studies. The students would be very fortunate, and society would be very fortunate. I wish you good health. From Lai Dingquan.

### Tight Money Loosens, Pressure Increases, Gold Market Price Hike Hindered, US Dollars and Hong Kong Notes Both Fall

Yesterday, due to the renewed pressure from the Bank of China, the market atmosphere was hindered and a slight reaction was seen. It showed a slight setback as soon as it opened in the morning. However, buyers were still trying to nibble. After the Bank of China released chips, it gradually fell from 1.94 million. Around 10 o'clock, it retreated to 1.89 million. The Bank of China allocated to over 110 gold businesses at a price of 1.885 million, which was slightly lower than the market price, the only time in recent days. The multiple sides felt oppressed and once fell to around 1.88 million. With the loose money, there was still some support at low prices, and it rose slightly to 1.9 million. At noon, it was still hovering around the allocated price. In the afternoon, the spot delivery once rose to 1.9 million and a few odd figures. The result was a drop of 55,000 compared to the previous closing. After 2 o'clock, the next-day delivery was again pressed down to 1.88 million. Gold ornaments are listed at 10,000, silver is flat, and silver coins are rising again. The underground interest rate is even looser, with interest rates at around 15%.

The foreign currency US dollar situation was mediocre. After opening, the gold market fell back, and it gradually declined from 2420 yuan to around 2380 yuan. After entering, it advanced and retreated between 2390 yuan and 2400 yuan. The situation was extremely stable. In the afternoon, it was slightly dragged down by the gold market. The result was a drop of 50 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes also fell 5 yuan, Hong Kong telegraph at 435 yuan, rupees at 535 yuan, both with supply. The US exchange rate remained flat, with the designated bank selling price at 2100. There were not many settlements either.

### Short Covering Continues, Government Bond Situation Becomes Firmer

The government bond situation remains stable. Short positions are continuously covering. The general psychology follows the big players and tends to be optimistic. Tong Bing opened at 6750 yuan in the morning. Demand and supply were relatively balanced. It once retreated from 6850 yuan to 6650 yuan. Short positions covered, and the situation became firmer. At noon, all were at high prices (more than 100 yuan higher than the closing price). The result was another rise of 300 yuan compared to the previous closing. Jia, Yi, Ding, and Wu also improved slightly.

### Rayon Prices Increase

Mill-made Silk Fabrics Fall Again

Yesterday's rayon market was firm in the morning and rose again in the afternoon. 120號 Tianqiao first opened at 1.43 million yuan. Until closing, there was not much change. This week, because the goods opened by China Textile Company last Saturday were mostly without boxes and not original packages, the market price uniformly increased. Tianqiao quoted 1.478 million yuan, an increase of 780,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of other brands also rose. Only 150 miscellaneous brands had poor price. It was sold at 230,000 yuan in the morning and 250,000 yuan in the afternoon. Mill silk 83 points high evenness was quoted at 2.6 million yuan, 78 points high evenness at 2.4 million yuan.

Dacheng checkered crepe was sold at 4,050 yuan per yard in the morning and 3,960 yuan in the afternoon, a decrease of 140-150 yuan compared to the day before.

### Wuyuan Refined Tribute Tea Hoards Goods

Wuyuan refined tribute tea, Indian Mumbai has considerable demand for high-quality teas. Therefore, even Japanese 白頭行家 have intentions to import. However, holders of the goods are hoarding them because they believe the market stock is running out, resulting in a gradual decrease in supply and difficult transactions. The situation is quite good. As for domestic sales of various designs, Tianjin merchants are not very active. However, the distribution from shops and merchants in this street and places like Suzhou and Wuxi has not weakened yet. Because the situation is quite peaceful for both buyers and sellers, it is still able to maintain stability.

### Spot Supply Falls Short of Demand, Yarn and Thread Rise Uniformly

Yesterday's yarn market was quite outstanding. The volume from Tianjin merchants has improved. Domestic sales on this street are also strong. Therefore, the price of each type of yarn rose by 120,000 or so. Because the Fangjian Company only sold to manufacturers on the previous day for 42-count double-ply yarn, without supplying any to yarn merchants, the thread price rose by 350,000. Although there are no large transactions in the current yarn market, the spot supply is still insufficient. With small purchases being made gradually from all sides, 20-count spot yarn is often out of stock. Therefore, people in the industry predict that the yarn price may have a surprising development when shipping routes are clear on all sides in the future.

The cotton market: New York American cotton rose sharply by 22-29 points. Nearby US dollars were at 27.60, forward at 28.24, and middling spot at 28.21. The local spot cotton market is still firm, but transactions have decreased slightly. Shenxin No. 6 Factory imported Brazilian cotton and Uruguayan cotton, Dasheng Factory imported Pengjiapo cotton, and Sulun imported 白洛去 cotton.

### Sugar Prices Continue to Fall Slightly

New Company's Goods Can Be Opened Today

Yesterday, with the auction of enemy-produced goods and the Taiwan New Company scheduled to open sugar goods today, the market trend softened. The Association's initial划盤 price for medium-grain white sugar was 72,000 yuan, dropping to a minimum of 69,000 yuan, then rising back to 72,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it hovered around 71,000 yuan, later at 71,500 yuan, a decrease of 34,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The auctioned goods included 840 bags of raw sugar, at 58,000 yuan,兌通. Four and a half cars of white sugar, over 900 bags, at 88,000 yuan, 327 bags plus 66 sacks, all at full price兌通. The sellers offered Shanmian赤高 goods at 72,000 yuan, followed by 67-8,000 yuan, Shang Diaoqing at 51,000 yuan to 50,500 yuan, followed by 50,000 to 49,500 yuan, and No. 3 yellow ice at 86,000 yuan.

### Gold and Diamonds: South Africa's Rich Treasures

Reuter's Dispatch from Cape Town, 22nd: South Africa's Minister of Mines Mr.斯特森 stated yesterday in the Senate that the future of the gold mining business in the Orange Free State is limitless. Its ore deposits are the richest of all the gold mines in South Africa. It is expected that nine new mines will be established in the province in the near future, or perhaps thirteen. Mr. 華氏 also stated that the future of South Africa's gold and diamond business is also very bright. The diamonds worth £14,000,000 that were in stock before the war, and those mined during the war, have all been sold. The world market seems likely to buy all of South Africa's diamonds in a considerable period of time.

### Speculative Funds Tend Towards Popular Stocks, More Chinese and Foreign Stocks Rise Than Fall

Chinese stocks: The financial community made a move on popular stocks, and short sellers in the industry were forced to cover. Yongsha's highest price was 5350 yuan, and Meiya's was 4250 yuan, and then slightly fell. Small stocks were unpopular because speculative funds tended towards popular stocks. Jingfu was the most inferior. Although the high prices of Xinguang and Qinxing were difficult to maintain, their situation was better than Jingfu because there were buyers. At noon, compared to the previous closing, Yongsha and Meiya each rose by half a cent, Jingfu fell slightly, and Xinguang and Qinxing rose by half a cent and slightly, respectively. Medium-sized stocks also recovered slightly, and veteran stocks still lacked vitality. Foreign stocks: Big players from the bond market moved over and suddenly competed to buy. Yisha opened in the morning and jumped to around 3500 yuan. It rose by more than 100 yuan in the middle and then fell slightly. The result was that the two popular stocks Yisha and American-Chinese each rose by one cent. Except for Paper Industry, Yeguang also rose by one cent. The rise of the remaining stocks was limited.

### Gansu Gasoline Production Increases

Reaches 2 Million Gallons Within Half a Year

Gansu Oilfield is the best-managed in the country. According to statistics, there are a total of 61 wells, of which 13 are currently producing oil. The crude oil production capacity is quite high, but gasoline production is still limited by transportation. There is a large stock of oil on the iron road. The processing power is limited and cannot be fully utilized. In terms of quality, there has been significant progress. The辛數 has been increased to 25 degrees, and the driving efficiency is much higher than that of alcohol, while the price is lower than alcohol. According to statistics, 2 million gallons of gasoline can be produced within half a year. As for the Usu Oilfield in Xinjiang, production is also being actively carried out.

### Sino-US Cooperation, Dongcheng Establishes Automobile Factory

Dongcheng Enterprise Company in this city plans to establish an automobile manufacturing factory.

In addition to the engineering technology being fully responsible by the American side, the funds and management will still be managed by the company. If there are no special events, the manufacturing factory is expected to be established this year. It is heard that it is estimated that 15 cars can be produced per day when the factory opens.

### Local Banks Are Not Allowed to Establish Branches in Shanghai

Regarding the prohibition of provincial banks or local banks from establishing branches or offices in Nanjing and Shanghai, it is heard that in fact, there is no need for provincial local banks to establish in Shanghai. For the sake of the future of the financial business of each province, the local banks of each province should seek development in this province. Therefore, the Shanghai branch of Zhejiang Local Bank has closed in compliance with the order. As for Jiangsu Bank and Jiangsu Farmers' Bank, because Nanjing and Shanghai originally belonged to Jiangsu, they can be established in Nanjing and Shanghai. It is heard that all provincial local banks that have opened in Nanjing and Shanghai have been ordered to close or changed to liaison offices. However, the Shanghai branch of Bank of Taiwan was specially approved by the Ministry of Finance to be established.

### Cotton Fabric Market Situation Improved

Due to purchases of serge, bleached cloth, and Tibetan broadcloth from Fujian, Guangdong, Sichuan, and Hubei provinces, Tianjin merchants have recently seen strong demand for grey cloth. They are particularly keen on acquiring 12-pound Three-A Color Ball cloth, followed by 12-pound Five Blessings Blue Chicken cloth. Fine cloth sales are also considerable, which has led to an increasingly robust grey cloth market. According to market sources, there is strong demand for military uniforms, and large companies have placed substantial orders for grey cloth. Today, the China Textile Company listed only three types of 12-pound fine cloth: Blue Chicken, Blue V-Character, and Red V-Character. Dragon Head Color Ball and Yang He brands were not listed, and the quantity allocated for purchase has generally been reduced. Twelve-pound Blue Chicken cloth is allocated at half the quantity specified on the deposit slip. Only registration numbers 120 to 170 for Touma Bleached Cloth are available; the rest are not allocated. Consequently, the market continued to rise in the afternoon, as the supply from the Textile Construction Company was scarce, pushing grey cloth prices even higher.

### British Bristles Insufficient for Demand; Supply Department Reduces Usage; Tianjin Export Goods Slightly Move

[Reuters, London, 23rd] The British Brush Manufacturers' Association recently held its annual meeting, where the supply of pig bristles was discussed. The Association stated that its members felt the Supply Department's recent reduction in the amount of bristles allocated to brush manufacturers was excessively severe. Last year, the Supply Department had hoped to airlift a batch of high-quality bristles stored in Chongqing to India, but this was not possible due to the suspension of air transport at the time. Currently, the Department is hesitant to transport the bristles via ship to the lower Yangtze River due to safety concerns, and no decision has been reached.

The Association unanimously passed a motion urging the Supply Department to publish the total stock of bristles to obtain valuable information on pricing and other related issues. An advisory committee has now been established to maintain close communication with the Supply Department. It is also reported that the Department sold South American bristles at a price of one pound and five-eighths for use in making shoe brushes and stove brushes, but the Bristle Identification Committee did not consider this significant.

[Tianjin News] Exports of fur and pig bristles from this city were very active in April, with most being shipped to the United States, and some to the United Kingdom, Australia, and Hong Kong. However, some of these goods did not meet the required standards, leading the New York Brush Manufacturers Association to send a letter to the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce specifying the required sizes. Subsequent shipments have adhered to these standards, making the outlook more optimistic. According to the Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau, the export statistics for April are as follows: Furs: a total of 392 bales and 204 boxes, valued at $1,070,156.107; Bristles: a total of 707 boxes, with 658 boxes failing to meet standards, 303.041 metric tons, with 32.783 metric tons failing to meet standards, valued at $4,050,960.856.

### Hunan and Guangdong Procure Rice in Jiangxi; Chairman Orders Ban on Hoarding

[Nanchang Dispatch] Last year, the Central Government stipulated the purchase of 2 million dan of surplus grain in Jiangxi to be transported to the lower Yangtze River. However, due to the devastation of the rural areas after eight years of war and a sharp decline in production, there is a fear that local grain will be impacted. The procurement price is far below the market price, so the purchase in each county has not been fulfilled. It was later approved to reduce the amount to 500,000 dan, to be delivered by the end of May. Chairman Wang recently went to Nanjing, where Chairman Chiang emphasized the importance of supplying the troops and prisoners of war, and instructed him to ensure the amount was delivered on time. Wang returned to the province from Lushan on the 16th and attached great importance to this matter. In addition to ordering the more than forty counties responsible for the procurement, such as Fengcheng, to ensure the quantity was purchased on time, he will also strengthen the transportation organization to concentrate the delivery in Jiujiang. It is reported that 170,000 dan have been purchased so far. The remaining amount is difficult to procure as the grain prices in various parts of the province are between $5,000 and $9,000, and it is currently the peak of the spring famine. It is rumored that the Central Government, to alleviate the suffering of the people, intends to increase the procurement price.

The neighboring provinces of Hunan and Guangdong are also facing severe grain shortages. The Jiangxi Provincial Land and Grain Bureau was ordered to allocate 200,000 dan of rice to Hunan and 100,000 dan to Guangdong. It is reported that the Provincial Bureau has designated the purchase of 100,000 dan in counties such as Dexing, Lianhua, and Anfu for Hunan, and 50,000 dan in areas such as Lichuan for Guangdong, to provide relief.

It is rumored that Chairman Chiang has personally ordered all party branches and senates in the southeastern provinces not to prohibit grain exports or obstruct the flow of grain under the pretext of insufficient food supply, so that areas with surplus grain can help those in need. (May 16th)

### Business Registration Fees Reduced to 1/2000th

[Report from this Newspaper] Since the implementation of industrial and commercial registration in this city, the high registration fees have been met with complaints from the local business community, who have repeatedly appealed through letters and telegrams. It has been learned that the Social Affairs Bureau, in response to public opinion, has drafted an alternative plan and submitted it to the Municipal Government for approval. In accordance with the new Company Law, the registration fee will be set at 1/2000th of the capital, and will be announced and implemented soon.

### After Three Days of Declines, the Rice Market Rebounded Yesterday; Coarse Grains and Oil Cakes Follow Suit

After several days of sharp declines in the rice market, merchants took advantage of the situation to stock up, and public sentiment improved. Indica rice rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and Xian rice also increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Flour also rose by 400 to 500 yuan. Soybeans also edged higher, increasing by 500 to 600 yuan. Bean cakes followed suit, rising by 200 to 300 yuan, and bran slightly increased by 100 to 200 yuan. Qingdao corn has become more popular and also rose by 1,000 yuan. The oil market has various sources of supply, but sales are sluggish, causing prices to increase by 1,000 yuan. All grains are following the rice price trend. According to rice market sources, a total of over 5,000 shih of rice arrived in the city yesterday. The types and quantities are as follows: White Geng 2,451 shih, Thin Rice 847 shih, Early Rice 718 shih, Yang Xian 233 shih, Du Xian 512 shih, Wu Xian 38 shih, and White Yuan 300 shih.

Wu Chang Rice Shop's Price Hike Investigated by the Social Affairs Bureau

[Central News Agency, This City] Since the Municipal Government took emergency measures to strictly prohibit speculation and manipulation, and investigated rice inventories in various warehouses, speculators have disappeared and stockpiled rice is gradually being released. The rice price has steadily returned to normal in recent days. When the market opened yesterday, it was calm and stable. At a price of $48,500, someone offered to sell over one hundred bags (Du Xian Ying Bag). Unexpectedly, Wu Chang Rice Shop deliberately raised the price of early thin rice to $55,000, and the market atmosphere immediately became tense. Most sellers held back, citing rising production costs and competing to raise prices, resulting in an increase of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The authorities were enraged upon hearing of this, and it was reported that the shop had raised prices to profiteer on more than ten occasions. The high prices seen in the rice market last week were all caused by the shop's actions, clearly demonstrating manipulative speculation and disrupting the rice market. The Social Affairs Bureau immediately dispatched a special investigator to the shop to review its accounting books, shareholder names, rice inventory, and transaction quantities for investigation. At the same time, the shop's manager, Rong Yongming, was summoned to the Bureau for questioning. If the above-mentioned misconduct is confirmed, he will be severely punished to serve as a warning to others.

Today is the Last Day for Business Registration for Rice and Grain Merchants

[Report from this Newspaper] To understand the rice and grain registration situation, the reporter visited the Bean and Rice Merchants Association and Rice Shop Association yesterday. It was learned that about 120 rice shops belonging to the Bean and Rice Merchants Association, holding rice in storage, have completed registration, with a total registered inventory of 35,900 shih. Over 1,000 rice shops belonging to the Rice Shop Association have completed registration, with an average inventory of about 50 shih per shop, totaling no more than 100,000 shih. In addition, the registered inventory for dealers is approximately 40,000 shih. Today is the last day for registration, and it is hoped that rice shops in the suburban areas will promptly register according to the situation, so that the associations can report the total registered amount to the Social Affairs Bureau tomorrow. According to general observations, the total registered rice inventory in the city is approximately 300,000 shih.

It is reported that the total amount of foreign rice recently ordered by the China Grain Corporation is 213,000 tons. It is rumored that a portion will be allocated to various rice shops and merchants for sale, in order to make it widely available on the market. The first batch of 6,000 tons of Annam rice is expected to arrive in Shanghai in early June. The Grain Administration Bureau explained that the rice merchants in the city have been greatly weakened by enemy and puppet exploitation over the years, and their purchasing power is much lower than before the war. In terms of current transportation capacity, they can barely supply the consumption needs of the Shanghai market. However, if citizens rush to buy and stockpile, the rice merchants will not be able to cope. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens will remain calm and stable during this lean period. When the foreign rice arrives in a steady stream, the food supply situation will surely improve.

### Losses of World War II: Most Accurate Statistics; Fatality Rate: Soviet Union Heaviest; China Ranks Fifth

— Special Article by This Newspaper Translation Office

The more advanced humanity becomes, the more proficient it is in mutual slaughter. During World War II, the warring nations engaged in fierce competition, and new types of killing weapons emerged one after another, causing unprecedented catastrophe in human history. Soldiers who died on the battlefield, civilians killed or injured in bombings, innocent people massacred by bandits, patriotic men and women persecuted by the enemy, and those displaced, starving, and impoverished... Whether in the East or West, in large or small countries, they all encountered the same fate. Wherever the flames of war spread, homes were reduced to ruins, corpses littered the fields, blood flowed in rivers, and the loss of life, property, manpower, and material resources was countless. This is truly a great loss for humanity.

### Total Population Loss Exceeds 50 Million

According to statistics published in the "1946 World Almanac" recently published by the American "New York World-Telegram," the total number of soldiers and civilians killed, injured, missing, and captured in World War II exceeded 50 million. These figures were compiled based on government communiqués, intelligence bureau records, quasi-official publications, wartime relief organizations, and newspaper accounts. The actual number of deaths is likely to be higher, as many went unrecorded. The number of deaths, missing, and captured in each country is listed in "Table 1."

We can see from "Table 1" that the Soviet Union suffered the most casualties. The number of people who died in the war against Germany is estimated at between 12 million and 15 million, with soldiers and civilians accounting for half each. The number listed in the table is the median. The second most affected country is Poland, with a total of 10,045,000 people, of whom 1,045,000 were soldiers and 9 million were civilians, including 5 million people (3 million of whom were Jewish) who were killed during the occupation. The third most affected country is Germany, with 9.9 million people. From this, we can imagine the devastation of the German-Soviet war, especially the inhuman brutality of the Germans under Hitler.

The fourth-highest fatality rate was Japan, with a total of 5,086,278 military casualties, not including civilians. Due to lack of medicine and malnutrition in the Japanese army, many soldiers suffered from diseases, totaling over 4.47 million, of whom at least 40,000 died from illness. According to a communiqué issued by the Tokyo authorities on August 23, 1945, 44 Japanese cities were almost completely destroyed, with a total of 10 million civilians killed, injured, and homeless. Among them, 260,000 people died, including 90,000 in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The number of injured was 412,000, including 180,000 injured in the atomic bombings. The total number of destroyed houses was 2.21 million, the number of partially destroyed houses was 90,000, and the number of homeless people was 9.2 million.

China ranks fifth in terms of fatality rate. According to a report by General He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army, on September 28, 1945, more than 1.8 million officers and soldiers died in China's eight-year war of resistance, with an additional 1.7 million injured and missing.

### Total Ship Losses Exceed 4,700 Vessels

According to figures released by the U.S. Navy and the British Admiralty on June 13, 1945, the total number of ships lost by the Allies and neutral countries in World War II was 4,770, with a total tonnage of 21,140,000 tons. The United States directly lost 570 ships in naval warfare and 984 ships due to accidents at sea. The number of U.S. merchant mariners killed, missing, and captured was 6,066. During the period from September 3, 1939, to May 8, 1945, the United Kingdom lost 2,570 ships (totaling 11,380,000 tons), the United States lost 538 ships (totaling 3,310,000 tons), other Allied nations lost 1,172 ships (totaling 5,030,000 tons), and neutral countries lost 490 ships (totaling 1,420,000 tons).

The ships lost by Finland, Hungary, Italy, and Japan are included in the total number of neutral countries before those countries entered into conflict with Britain and the United States, but ships controlled by enemy countries after the outbreak of war are not included. The actual number of losses is higher than this, as the ships seized by Germany in occupied countries are not included, nor are auxiliary ships currently serving in the army or navy.

The statistics of ship losses of the Allied and neutral countries published by the U.S. Navy and the British Admiralty are listed in "Table 2."

According to another statistic, the United States lost a total of 696 ships in World War II, the United Kingdom lost 730 ships, the British Dominions lost 46 ships, and Japan lost 684 ships. At the end of the war, Japan still had 533 warships. According to a joint British-American report issued on June 10, 1945, the Allies destroyed a total of 713 German submarines in the Atlantic campaign.

The total tonnage of merchant ships lost by Japan in World War II was 6.13 million tons, as listed in "Table 3."

(Table 3: Statistics of Merchant Ships Lost by Japan)

### British and American Bombs Dropped Totaled 2.7 Million Tons

The actual situation of air force activities and losses of the United States and Britain in World War II is listed in "Table 4."

According to a report by the U.S. Air Force, a total of 502,781 tons of bombs were dropped in the Pacific War, destroying 7,362 enemy aircraft and losing 4,530 aircraft.

According to a statement made by a Japanese government spokesman on September 5, 1945, Japan lost 51,109 aircraft in the Pacific War. The Japanese Army built a total of 32,500 aircraft and lost 25,500 in the war. The Japanese Navy built a total of 30,295 aircraft and lost 25,609 in the war. In other words, Japan lost 51,109 of its 62,795 aircraft.

### Changchun, the 29th Day

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Shao Shenzhi

(6)

While the debate on whether to break through was undecided, a unit of the Communist army had already crept in from the northwest of the Central Bank. Using the undulating terrain, they charged in through the back door. This was at 5 PM. The defending troops' positions had shifted to the rear entrance of the Central Bank. Machine guns fired outwards, the sound seeming to be just outside the door. Deputy Commander Liu Depu led over a hundred men in a charge, annihilating the approaching Communist soldiers. Only the sound of gunfire grew more distant. Due to Liu Depu's successful attack, the final decision to break out was made.

However, the battle continued. At this time, near Dongtuo, a company of Communist soldiers surrendered with their guns raised, because they had run out of ammunition. They reported and asked how to handle the situation. It was later unknown how it was handled.

The breakout began, but the Communist army had sealed it off with a wall of fire. The first few to rush out all fell to the ground. Shenzhi entered the next lower level of the vault, anticipating that the possibility of a breakout was already very small. He actually witnessed the final moments of this tragic disaster.

A portion opened the main gate and went out, but the main gate was a revolving door, extremely narrow. So they smashed the glass and jumped out one by one. A line formed behind, filling the business department to capacity. It took a long time; how could four or five hundred people run out all at once?

Chen Jiazhen and Wang Ninghua, the acting chairman of the Jilin Provincial Government, as well as many civil servants, all went out through the east side door. Shenzhi sat in the vault and slept, confident in his safety. Also there were three employees of the China Changchun Railway (CCR), who had come to the Central Bank yesterday on business, and could only hide here, awaiting being taken as "prisoners," constantly lamenting their bad luck.

Six Searches for "Prisoners"

The four people sat in the middle of the vault's corridor, hearing the sound of gunfire gradually diminish outside. At around 9 o'clock, a flurry of footsteps rushed into the vault. The road to the vault was a very winding one, making it easy to get lost. A CCR employee stepped forward to greet them, seeing that it was indeed Communist soldiers, fierce and with oily faces. He saw that all four were in plain clothes and asked, "Where are you from?" They replied that they were employees of the CCR company. Thereupon, he felt them all over, checking for weapons. This was the first search.

Several Communist soldiers thought they were prisoners and told Shenzhi and the others to follow them. Naturally, they had no choice but to follow, because they had guns, and their logic was stronger than yours.

Before leaving, they checked again, but a different soldier this time, to see if they had any weapons. This was the second time.

Stepping out the door, all that could be seen was the city hall engulfed in flames, fire tongues licking the sky, dead bodies strewn on the ground. There was no time to pay close attention. The hundred or so security team members who had been captured by the Communist soldiers were already lined up, and we were told to stand with them, and then start walking. The sound of guns and cannons in the suburbs was still dense, possibly from a portion that had broken through. The four people followed and ran, gathering in the open space behind the police station, unsure of what was going on. After waiting for a while, a Communist soldier, handgun in hand, ran over and said: "Take out your watches."

Shenzhi tried to reason with him, but it was no use. The Communist soldier said: "You are already prisoners, don't you know?" What if they didn't know? The gun was already pointed at his chest. Anyway, it was pulled off his wrist. This was the third search.

The next item on the agenda was walking again. Passing through Baishan Park, through iron netting, the obstacles of corpses and sandbags, to Tongzhi Road, then turning onto Xingren Street, stopping on the road at the Mantan Gate. A large group of people was already sitting on the road at the Mantan Gate, all in plain clothes. Under the moonlight, they all looked disheveled and swollen-faced, surrounded by bayonets on all sides. The four people were separated from the security team again, also surrounded by bayonets on all sides. An Anhui-accented character was hoarsely addressing the large group of people sitting down: "...The Kuomintang is not guilty for losing the Northeast, but you four hundred Northeast compatriots are guilty?" It turned out that those sitting on the ground listening to the lecture were criminals released from prison. The Anhui-accented voice continued: "Zhao Junmai lost Hengyang, but the Kuomintang didn't punish him. He's not guilty. Now he's been sent to Changchun as mayor. Do you agree or disagree? Now you're liberated. Those who want to go home can go home. Those who want to stay here and work can stay here."

This gentleman rambled from the September 18th Incident all the way to the elected government, for a full hour and a half. These criminals, guarded by bayonets, applauded wildly, naturally signifying their agreement and admiration. Who would clap if they didn't admire him?

A separate, more distant group was being lectured to as prisoners. Only applause could be heard, but what brilliant ideas were being said was unknown. The moon rose in the south, large and round. Although it was April, the evening wind was still cold and biting. All four had lost their watches. They didn't know the time, but it was probably midnight.

Suddenly, the four were told to follow again. At this time, prisoners and criminals were mixed together, rushed into the Red Swastika Society next to the Mantan Building. In the crowd, Shenzhi was searched for weapons again by a Communist soldier. This time, the camera was taken away. He said: "It's not convenient to keep this thing on you." This was the fourth search.

Five or six hundred people surged in, all going upstairs, extremely chaotic. A Communist soldier shouted an order for everyone to rest. Shenzhi and the others dragged a few chairs over and sat down to doze off. Everyone was extremely tired and fell asleep as soon as they sat down. Halfway through his sleep, he was awakened by a Communist soldier, saying there was something to do. Opening his eyes, he saw the floor, tables, and window sills were covered with sleeping people, like maggots, barely any room to put his foot. The four managed to struggle to the stairs, one by one being led into rooms to be checked. They asked for their names. The three CCR employees each took out their service certificates, respectfully presenting them to the "People's Army." The photos matched, completely accurate, but they were still searched, turning over all the pockets. The items the three friends lost were generally the same: pens, money, knives, nail clippers, shirts, shorts, etc. In this battle, Shenzhi had a pen, a shirt, shorts, two pairs of socks, a razor, and 5,000 yuan in circulation notes taken from his pockets. At this point, Shenzhi became democratic with the "People's Army," expressing his opinion, saying:

"I heard that your Eighth Route Army doesn't take money, is that right?"

"Don't worry, I won't take yours. Take it back."

But after the search was completed, as they walked out the door, a Communist soldier came up from behind, reaching out his hand and saying:

"Give me the money."

What to do? Naturally, he gave it to him, but asked him a question: "Can you let me leave here?" He replied: "We'll see." The hand of democracy was raised upwards, but this hand was reaching downwards. He was from the Eighth Route Army. Shenzhi did not say that he was a reporter for the Central Daily News, only that he was a reporter for Shenbao, and showed them his credentials. This was the fifth search.

The four returned and sat on their chairs, dozing off haphazardly. Not long after, dawn was breaking. Communist soldiers came one after another, looking at the prisoners to see if there was anything they could use, mostly taking shoes and belts. As a result, many prisoners were walking barefoot, but the weather was too cold to bear, so they wrapped their leggings around their feet. This happened to Shenzhi. While he was dozing, a Communist soldier picked up his foot to examine it. Shenzhi said: "Unless you shoot me dead, you can't take it." This Communist soldier felt embarrassed and slipped away without a word. This was the sixth search.

Shenzhi and the others wrote a note and gave it to the Communist soldiers, asking to see their commander. They promised to pass it on, but there was no reply after five hours. At noon, the criminals and prisoners were taken away in batches. The building emptied, leaving only Shenzhi and the others. Half an hour later, the guy who took the 5,000 yuan walked over and said: "Aren't you leaving yet?" Another Communist soldier said: "Why didn't you run with the people who left just now?" The first one corrected him: "Those four are not prisoners."

What did this mean? The four stood up and ran, and no one stopped them. Running out of the Red Swastika Society gate, they walked west along Xingren Avenue.

Shenzhi did not immediately return to his residence, but walked along Tongzhi Street, circling around to the Central Bank to take a look. Only Japanese were walking freely on the road. The fire at the City Hall had not been extinguished, and smoke was still rising behind the Central Bank. There were not many Communist soldiers on the street. Shenzhi walked alone back to his residence. A Communist soldier was guarding the door, but did not stop him. After washing his face, he immediately took off his clothes and went to sleep, exhausted all over, as if he had performed a special martial arts play.

### Visiting the Dragon Well Tea

The most expensive kind of Longjing tea is called "Mingqian" (pre-Qingming). In Hangzhou tea shops, the selling price is 3,000 yuan per ounce, 48,000 yuan per catty (pound). According to Master Wuben of Shengsou Temple at the foot of Shizi Peak on North Gao Peak in Hangzhou, the true origin of Longjing tea, this is not keeping up with the price of rice. Before the war, the price of Longjing "Mingqian" tea was sixteen yuan per catty, equivalent to two loads of rice. Currently, the price of rice in Hangzhou is 50,000 yuan, meaning the price of tea has fallen by half.

There is an old Longjing stele inside Shengsou Temple, carved on the pool rock. In front of the temple is a short tea grove. Master Wuben said: "This is the famous 'Eighteen Ancient Dragon Well Tea Plants,' planted during the reign of Emperor Kang of the Southern Song Dynasty." (I don't quite believe that plants from the Southern Song Dynasty could still remain after so long.) Master Wuben talked to me about tea for two hours in a small pavilion in front of the Longjing pool rock. The tea produced on the four peaks of Long, Hu, Shi, and Yun in the suburbs of Hangzhou are all called Longjing tea. Among the four peaks, Shizi Peak tea is the best. A French professor at Zhejiang University believes that the reason is that the soil of Shizi Peak contains more iron and manganese, and is white sandy soil, while the other peaks are yellow sandy soil, so they are inferior to Shizi Peak. Currently, most of the Shizi Peak tea is picked and roasted by the Shizi Peak Tea Company, invested and managed by the Bank of China. The products are mostly distributed among the bank's own colleagues, with only a small amount sold on the market. His Shengsou Temple planted a small amount. Every year before Qingming Festival, he hires Xiaoshan tea girls and tea boys to pick leaves in the mountains and roast them in the temple. He believes that the "Mingqian" tea sold on the market is impossible, because before Qingming, the tea just sprouts, the buds are tender and very moist, and cannot be processed. Generally, it is called "Jiaoqian" (before-bud), but is actually picked and processed "Minghou" (after-Qingming), and can also be called "Yuqian" (before-rain) tea.

This old monk has never left the Longjing tea area during the eight years of turmoil, guarding this temple, and witnessing the vicissitudes of the mountains. He said that in the eight years, there were always people picking leaves from the tea mountains every year, but no one weeded or controlled pests, so that today, tea trees and vines and insects are intertwined on both sides of the mountain paths, and the tea leaves are no longer as fresh and tender as they were eight years ago.

From Yunlin Temple, I passed through the Three Heavenly Sanctuaries, climbed to the Que Ridge on North Gao Peak, and down to the Longjing valley. By the time we had finished our conversation, the sun was setting in the west. Master Wuben sent a tea boy to lead me out of the mountains to the source of the Nine Creeks and Eighteen Streams. Along the way, tea-picking women wore bamboo hats and torn blue cloth shirts, and wore tea baskets like fishermen's gear around their waists. Sitting on their own small wooden stools, they picked leaves one by one in the green tea bushes. I stopped many times to inquire about their wages. They said: "Twenty yuan per ounce, three hundred and twenty yuan per catty."

"How many catties can you pick in a day?"

"We can pick four or five catties of fresh leaves in a day."

Most of them are from Xiaoshan County. They cross the Qiantang River north during the tea season to work as seasonal tea pickers in the mountains. Their monthly income is only thirty or forty thousand yuan. After the tea season, they still return to their homes in Xiaoshan and work as farmers. In this tea-picking work under the sun and rain, they may have their own pastoral romances, but the hard work and meager income do not inspire the tea songs in the mountains, so tourists want to hear a tea song but cannot.

Longjing tea from the Jiuxi tea farm, paired with creek water, tastes like bathing your feet in cold stream water. The tea seats under the reed sheds here and the female tea guests make people forget that they are in a chaotic world. My fellow traveler and I left the Jiuxi tea farm and walked on the stone road to the Qiantang River, hired a small boat and sailed downstream towards Hangzhou. On the boat, we watched the Qiantang River flow towards the East China Sea, the current calm and the surface wide, silent yet seemingly with sound. In a moment, the red-tiled buildings and green trees of Zhejiang University passed by. In a moment, the tall shadow of the Six Harmonies Pagoda passed by. In a moment, we secretly floated past the Qiantang River Railway Bridge. We landed outside the city of Hangzhou and hired a car again to enter the city via the highway and the lakeside. We saw that lotus leaves had just begun to float on the surface of the South Lake. The summer nights are soon to be fragrant on the lake. Just the lake, the lotus, and the boats are enough to attract people to the summer nights of West Lake. After our ordeal, we really want to be professional boatmen, rowing for lovers, blowing away all the dust of our travels in the evening breeze.

However, according to the boatman, a white wooden boat currently costs 200,000 yuan to build. If it is fully equipped, with various facilities such as sofa cushions and awnings, it costs 450,000 yuan. We are, after all, a cog in the current social arrangement. This lakeside life is destined not to be our fate. We are afraid we won't have the opportunity to visit West Lake in the hot summer, so let's take a few deep breaths of the fresh air on the lake at night.

In our last lake tour, the boatman said again that the reason why West Lake is always beautiful and always fresh is because its perpetual flow of spring water from the high mountains on the north, south, and west sides flows into the Qiantang River through a hidden sluice gate on the east side. During the day, the tour boats disturb the water quality, but at night, fresh spring water flows east to the lake, and the turbid and polluted lake water secretly flows into the river. In the morning, the water on the lake is as fresh as new again. Therefore, the residents by the lake store water in wooden buckets early in the morning for drinking throughout the day. The people of Hangzhou are happy. The water quality is good, and the lake and mountains are beautiful, making them infinitely admired.

### Ideal New Enterprise Experimental Demonstration Zone: Yunnan Sericulture New Village

— Kunming, 17th Dispatch, Bo Ying

On April 16th, I took the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway express train from Kunming to Kaiyuan. The train departed at 7:00 AM and arrived at 6:00 PM. I spent the entire day cooped up in the carriage, feeling extremely tired. Fortunately, I had a classmate, Mr. Yang, traveling with me, and we chatted and laughed to pass the long hours. Mr. Yang is specializing in sericulture, and this time he is going to the Caoba Sericulture New Village for an internship. As for me, I am there for sightseeing, focusing on investigating the organization and general overview of the new village. Although our purposes are different, our interests are the same. The next day, we were delayed in Kaiyuan due to rain. On the 18th, we took the train south from Kaiyuan again, and got off at the station before Bisezhai, and arrived at Caoba. (In the Yunnan dialect, a plateau surrounded by mountains is called a "ba").

Caoba is located in the Mengzi County of Yunnan, close to Kaiyuan County. It is a flat area surrounded by mountains on all sides, with a total area of approximately 85,000 mu. The Yunnan Sericulture New Village is located there. Before the establishment of the Kaimeng Reclamation Bureau by the Yunnan Provincial Government, Caoba suffered from neglected water conservancy, barren land, sparse population, and a generally desolate appearance. After the Kaimeng Reclamation Bureau was established, it began to gradually buy back all land rights at market prices. Within two years, ditches were dredged, fields were divided, and the atmosphere was completely renewed.

Establishing a Sericulture New Village Creates a Demonstrative Effect

The Yunnan Sericulture New Village was established in the 28th year of the Republic (1939), occupying 10,000 mu of land, leased from the Reclamation Bureau for a long term. The establishment of the Sericulture New Village is an experiment of an ideal new enterprise. The purpose is to build a model new rural area, as preparation for the transformation of our country's rural areas and the improvement of our country's agriculture. The experimental scientific spirit and demonstrative nature of the founders will undoubtedly have merit and value for the future of our country's agriculture.

In April of the 28th year of the Republic, after the establishment meeting of the Yunnan Sericulture New Village Co., Ltd. was held in Kunming, this Yunnan Sericulture New Village was conceived. Originally, the name of the company, the words "Sericulture" indicated the scope, and the words "New Village" indicated the system. Although the company was established in accordance with the Limited Company Organization Law, the shareholders who make up this company are not individuals, but banks affiliated with the central and local governments. The initial total capital was 10 million national currency, which increased to 25 million in the 30th year (1941), and remains so to this day. The industrial magnate Mr. Miao Yuntai serves as the chairman of the company, and the agricultural expert Mr. Ge Jingzhong serves as the general manager.

The New Village Occupies Ten Thousand Mu of Green Mulberry Trees Stretching Endlessly

Regarding the organization of the company, under the general manager, there is a chief technician responsible for technical aspects, and the following departments are also established: General Affairs Department, overseeing all affairs; Finance Department, managing the company's income and expenditure; Mulberry Affairs Department, responsible for mulberry planting; Sericulture Affairs Department, responsible for silkworm rearing; Silk Affairs Department, responsible for reeling silk; Education Department, jointly operated with the Reclamation Bureau, responsible for educating farmers' children. There are also a silk factory and an alcohol factory. In addition to refining alcohol, the alcohol factory also uses mulberries to produce juice. In recent years, Mulberry Wine, which is popular in Kunming and enjoyed by the Allied forces, is mostly supplied from here. In addition, there is also an office and a cold storage facility in Kunming.

The new village occupies approximately 10,000 mu, of which more than 7,000 mu are mulberry orchards. Because the initial plan was very ambitious, preparing to gradually expand and include the entire Caoba area within the scope of the new village, many facilities are comprehensive. The new village has two major roads in a cross shape, each seven meters wide. From east to west, it connects Caoba Station and reaches the foot of West Mountain. From south to north, it reaches the foot of North Mountain from the foot of South Mountain. When I got off the train at Caoba Station and strolled along the east-west main road, I saw green mulberry trees on both sides, stretching across fields and ridges. Looking ahead, the main road paved with gravel stretched straight west, endlessly. My heart was refreshed.

The Eastern Section of the East-West Main Road is Designated as the New Village Area

The southern end of Caoba Station, next to the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, is designated as an industrial zone, where the silk factory and alcohol factory are located. On the Caoba early-stage side of the east-west main road is the Sixteenth Village. According to the company's original plan, many small villages would be established, each with fifty "lian" (units), and each "lian" with two unit village houses. Each unit village house would have two rooms with a depth of 7.25 meters and a width of 4.50 meters for work, and two rooms with a depth of 4.25 meters and a width of 3.35 meters for living, plus a kitchen and a toilet. The distance between each "lian" is 15 meters from front to back, and 6 meters from left to right. However, just after the Sixteenth and Thirteenth Villages were built, Vietnam fell into enemy hands, and the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was interrupted, the source of materials was lacking, and the construction project came to a standstill. Later, the Reclamation Bureau used skilled craftsmen (initially, all the carpenters, masons, bamboo workers, and stone workers in the new village were hired from the lower Yangtze River region, numbering thousands) to build many small villages using local materials, such as the First Village, Second Village, Fifth Village, Sixth Village, Seventeenth Village, and Nineteenth Village, and Twentieth Village, etc., which are now distributed in Caoba, for tenants who cultivate the land of the Bureau. Walking west along this main road from the Sixteenth Village for twenty minutes, one reaches the Thirteenth Village. A reception center and a hospital are located between the two villages. Further west to the intersection of the cross-shaped main road, this place was originally planned to be the ideal center of the new village, the central hub of the entire village, but it did not materialize. Strictly speaking, the current scope of the new village is limited to the eastern section of the east-west main road.

The Main Business is Divided into Three Items: Mulberry Planting, Silkworm Rearing, and Silk Reeling

The Sericulture New Village, as its name suggests, is mainly engaged in sericulture. Sericulture includes three items: mulberry planting, silkworm rearing, and silk reeling. Mulberry planting and silk reeling are handled by the Sericulture Company. Because large-scale mulberry planting, managed in a unified way, is easier to obtain uniform and good mulberry leaves. As for silk reeling, because it is necessary to produce uniform and high-grade raw silk, good machinery and equipment are needed, and a good market must be sought, so the company must have this right and obligation during its business period. Therefore, only the second item, silkworm rearing, is the true main business of the villagers. Villagers are recruited from nearby farmers and people from outside, and the company provides them with considerable technical training. These people are called "village friends" here. The company provides village friends with housing, silkworm seeds, silkworm rooms, and silkworm tools. In order to take care of the economic situation of ordinary farmers, a method of pre-paying cocoon money is also provided for relief. Because we know that the usual cost of silkworm cocoons includes: silkworm seeds, mulberry leaves, silkworm rooms, silkworm tools, labor, and food. In addition to the first four items provided by the company, labor, food, and other expenses still require cash expenditure. The so-called "pre-paying cocoon money" method is to estimate the number of cocoons you will receive in the future based on the number of silkworm eggs you initially raised, and then convert it into a market price. After deducting the cost of silkworm seeds, mulberry leaves, etc., the company can allow you to use it in advance in installments, without having to wait until the time of handing over the cocoons.

The Prosperous Period Has Passed, and the New Village Scene is Desolate

Normally, rearing one "liang" (a unit of weight) of silkworm eggs can produce two "dan" (another unit of weight) of cocoons. During the heyday of the new village, about 900 "dan" of cocoons could be produced each season. There are two seasons a year, spring and autumn, so 1,800 "dan" could be harvested. Caoba was quite prosperous at that time. However, later, inflation deteriorated daily, the production business trended downward, and the government promoted a policy of unified purchase and sale. Silk was also included in the unified purchase and sale, so costs rose daily, but prices could not be raised, and silk production fell into a desperate situation. The prosperity of the new village was no longer seen. After August of last year, the national economy was depressed, which came along with the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. In late September, it was necessary to tighten the belt again. Although this was called tightening, it was actually an ending. All departments, except for a very small number of people left behind for aftercare, were all laid off. Therefore, when I arrived at Caoba this time, the scene was quite desolate. After the company closed last year, the houses were occupied by the military and all were damaged. The silk factory and alcohol factory were also silent, frighteningly desolate. Now only the Thirteenth Village is still raising silkworms. This is what was restored this spring, because after Mr. Ge Jingzhong went to Shanghai, he saw that the sericulture industry in the Jiangzhe area was almost completely destroyed during the Anti-Japanese War. This year, Jiangzhe can produce at most 400,000 sheets of silkworm seeds, while the national demand is 1.2 million sheets. Except for a portion that can be imported from Japan, it is still insufficient. Therefore, he advocated the restoration of the Sericulture New Village, but to ensure that it would not lose money, the scope of work was limited to seed production. It is now estimated that 180,000 sheets of seeds can be produced this season (spring), and roughly the same number can be produced in the autumn, so Caoba can produce about 350,000 sheets of silkworm seeds this year.

Yunnan's Dry Climate is Suitable for Silkworm Seed Production

We look forward to the future of our country's sericulture industry with optimism, because the following three reasons create our optimistic factors: (1) The recovery of foreign markets, especially the large demand from the United States. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from New York on May 12, the United States needs our special products, and silk is among them. (2) Due to the recovery of the occupied areas, the area using silk is expanding accordingly. (3) The abolition of the government's unified purchase and sale policy. Naturally, there are difficulties, such as: (1) The devastating destruction of the sericulture industry in the occupied areas. The Taihu area, the largest sericulture area in our country, has been destroyed by more than 70 percent. Other areas, such as Guangdong, Shandong, and the Northeast, have also been severely damaged. It will take more than three to five years to restore them. (2) Competition from Japan. The foundation of the Japanese sericulture industry is better than ours, so recovery is easier. Moreover, since Japan's defeat in the war, heavy industry is under the control of the Allied powers and cannot be revived. They can only seek development in light industries such as silk. (3) The widespread application of the American industrial product, Nylon. However, these difficulties can be overcome by human effort. Of course, this depends on the efforts of sericulture professionals and the formulation of good sericulture policies by the government. As for Yunnan sericulture, although it is inferior to Jiangzhe and Guangdong, Yunnan's climate is high and dry, especially suitable for seed production. If efforts can be made in this area, there will be promising opportunities. Finally, I would like to thank Professor Hu Hongjun, a sericulture expert currently in charge of seed production in Caoba, because his detailed instructions enabled me to successfully complete this dispatch.

Spring and Autumn

### A Brief Discussion on the Forms of Comedy

— Yang Tongfang

Recently, some people have been shouting: We need to express deep sorrow, and we need more to gain the power of life in hearty laughter. On the other side of tragedy, comedy is even more needed. Comedy is the art of providing people with materials for "laughter." However, the "laughter" referred to by the ancients should be full of artistic atmosphere, hidden deep in people's souls, enough to evoke humanity's highest and ideal life, and give humanity the highest spiritual comfort. It is not laughter caused by low-level interests or laughter caused by vulgar ideas.

Comedy, just like tragedy, has its social significance. Of course, it also analyzes the truth of society for people to see, writing about good people and ugly people, praising the greatness of life's ideals and exposing the darkness of society, with warmth and coldness. It reveals the darkness behind the sunshine, and the lewdness behind the solemnity. In fact, according to Galsworthy, tragedy and comedy do not have absolute and distinct differences, and cannot even be distinguished literally. Indeed, tragedy permeates the element of sorrow, expressing the hardships and sorrows of the world, making the audience also feel a deep sorrow. Comedy, on the other hand, treats certain shortcomings in individuals or society with an attitude of joking and scolding, allowing the audience to feel an inner laugh. But you cannot say that there is no sorrow in comedy. Moreover, some great comedies, such as Gogol's "The Inspector General," from the severe and penetrating satire, will make people feel a sense of unspeakable and unlaughable distress.

From the history of Western literature, we can trace the characteristics of comedy. In the entire development of comedy, there are various forms. Roughly, the kind of comedy in Rome that is based on tricks or romance belongs to one category, and the kind of comedy in the Elizabethan era that has romanticism color and spirit is another category. Contemporary with the romantic comedy full of fantasy, there is another kind of satirical realistic comedy. Molière's comedy of manners in France also emerged at the same time. In addition, the comedy of wit in the English Restoration era is another form, and the sentimental comedy from the eighteenth century to the beginning of the nineteenth century should belong to another category.

In the modern era, comedy does not seem to have produced new material. It can also be said that modern comedy has not created forms that transcend the past. The characteristics and effects of ancient comedy exist separately in modern comedy. As the drama theorist Zhang Min said: "Many comedies have the old form in their essence, but have changed slightly due to the special conditions of the modern stage and society. Some comedies are mixed with two or more old forms." Therefore, to understand the characteristics of modern comedy, we must recognize the various forms of ancient comedy.

Greene's "Haysm Hallway" and Crothers's "The Held Island" are like typical characters, set off in ridiculous dialogues, and do not have exaggerated characteristics like "farces." This is a representative of Roman comedy based on situations or tricks. In John Millington Synge's "The Playboy of the Western World" and George Bernard Shaw's "The Doctor's Dilemma," the foolishness of people in society at that time is revealed and satirized. To put it mildly, it is very similar to the satirical realistic works written by comedians like Jonson in the Elizabethan era. The characteristics of the romantic comedy of the Elizabethan era can sometimes be found in the works of Barker and Housman. As for the spirit of Shakespeare's romantic comedy, it is fully expressed in modern musical comedy.

Molière's comedy in France is a school of its own. It is based on the conflict of various opposing ideas of people, expressing the relationship between people and people, and people and society, with a humorous but serious attitude. This is called the comedy of manners, and it is the most perfect and highest form of comedy. It is much more difficult to write successful works of this kind than other types of comedy, because it is not easy to handle characters, especially the characters' personalities. Pinero's "The Second Mrs. Tanqueray," Berman's "The Second Man," and Shaw's "Candida" are known to belong to the comedy of manners.

In addition, speaking of comedies that are based on wit and humor, and reveal fun from dialogues, they seem to be rare in modern times, although they occupy a very important position in the characteristics of various modern comedies. Oscar Wilde's "Lady Windermere's Fan" and Maugham's "The Circle" can be said to be successful works of humorous comedy.

The least noticeable is the sentimental comedy of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century. It is still a question whether this type of comedy has its artistic value. According to modern comedians, sentimental comedy cannot be regarded as a success, because it tries its best to eliminate an atmosphere of X, which is recognized as the main characteristic of comedy. At the same time, modern comedies are mostly permeated with the elements of fantasy, while sentimental comedies do not focus on fantasy, and even exclude fantasy. In modern times, Barre is relatively close to sentimental comedy. Analyzing his works, the sentimental elements are indeed dominant.

The past forms of comedy have had a great influence on modern comedians. Some writers grasp one past form of comedy, and some writers combine two past forms of comedy. Kelly's "The Torch-Bearers" mixes the characteristics of Roman comedy and English Restoration comedy. Some people say that modern comedy imitates old forms of the past and fails to create new things. This statement is incorrect. Originally, the development of comedy also has a certain inevitable trend in the invisible. After historical evolution, it has reached the peak of its development in modern times. We naturally cannot hope that new forms will be created, because the basic characteristics of comedy limit it. The existence of past comedy forms in modern comedy can only be said to be an inevitable result, and cannot be said to be purely imitation.

In short, modern comedy is formed by grasping the various comedic characteristics provided by past comedians, through the conditions of modern society and the stage. Modern comedy can also be said to be the highest and most perfect stage in the entire development of comedy. Modern comedians have adopted the theories and practices of past comedy to expand the artistic value of modern comedy and promote the artistic function of modern comedy, making it form a most perfect form of comedy.

### Life and Art

— Song Shouchang

People often misunderstand the two words "life," thinking that life is simply survival. However, according to the meanings of both, survival is merely one of the conditions of life, but not the entirety of it. What is called life can be divided into two aspects: (1) Survival – the material life; (2) Liveliness/Interest – the spiritual life.

For example, if a creature wants to ensure its existence, struggling to satisfy hunger, cold, and housing, this is called survival. Life, in addition to striving for survival, also requires a rich sense of interest. In other words, life is joyful and upward-moving. The interest in life—liveliness—is the driving force behind social evolution. If life has no interest, then nothing has the hope of evolving; such a life becomes a stagnant life. A society organized by humans with this kind of life is also bound to be stagnant and will never evolve. Therefore, I say that life is not just about living for survival; life must have meaning and interest. The major obstacles on the path of social evolution will naturally be easier to resolve.

Taking human life and animal life as an example: animal life is simple and can only be described as survival. Humans not only need to survive, but also have lives that animals do not possess, namely, the so-called spiritual life. The difference between humans and animals lies in this point. Therefore, humans are called "rational animals." There is a kind of spiritual activity in human life, which is thought, emotion, and will. This kind of spiritual activity can produce multifaceted effects. Through the activity of thought, all truths in science and philosophy are discovered; it is the source of knowledge and philosophy. From the activity of emotion, the beauty hidden in nature is inspired, and art with diverse forms and different interests is created, allowing human life to experience the edification and enjoyment of beauty. The interest of life is built on the foundation of this emotional activity. Through the activity of will, behavior and morality are expressed. These three are unique to rational animals. Although animals have a brain, they do not use thought. Animals may have emotional functions, but they lack noble and beautiful sentiments, and they generally lack what is called aesthetic sense. Therefore, there is no discovery of scientific knowledge, nor a life of interest or a life of beauty.

In order to cope with the environment, both humans and animals originally have a kind of ability to survive. For example, human life needs clothing, housing, and food; animals also know to find food to avoid hunger, to live in mountain caves to avoid wind and rain and to defend against other creatures. They grow long fur on their bodies to protect themselves from the heat and cold. Fierce claws and teeth, and great strength, their power to resist external enemies is several times stronger than that of humans, but why can't animals not only win against humans, but are instead subdued by humans? Humans are advancing on the track of evolution every day, while animals are only slowly moving towards the realm of degeneration. The reason is that their lives are only about survival.

Since we are called rational animals, then we should all live in human life. Whatever life animals do not have, humans uniquely have; whatever life animals cannot do, humans can do. This kind of life that animals do not have and cannot do depends entirely on the beautiful emotions in our spiritual activities to create. Because emotion is the engine for creating everything, only a life of emotion is an interesting life. We must not only focus on measuring and calculating material life, but also need the adjustment of spiritual life, so that life has a rich interest and seeks spiritual pleasure. For example, as mentioned earlier, don't animals also have clothing, food, and shelter? However, they are ultimately inferior to human clothing, which is particular about being warm in winter and cool in summer, and able to suit our body temperature; food that is fresh and delicious; and housing that is grand and exquisite. Where do they have the qualification to enjoy this kind of life?

Furthermore, like cultivating temperament and enjoying life through music, painting, etc., using the combination of sounds to express beautiful melodies, using the combination of colors to create beautiful natural scenery, can animals create these pleasing things? Even if they can, they are ultimately different from humans in spirit. In short, this kind of beautiful performance is unique to human life. Humans demand a proper life and enjoy a pleasant life; the most important thing is to have an interesting life. To be a person without the interest of life is not human life, no different from animal life!

How can we cultivate a proper and interesting life? That must rely on the function of art, using the appreciation of artworks to train beautiful emotions, such as music, dance, drama, film, painting...etc., which are all very interesting arts. They can not only cultivate our temperament, but also adjust our lives, and be unknowingly integrated by art, gradually eliminating dirty thoughts and degenerate will, and moving towards the road of interesting life!

### Desolate Dream

— Zhongyuan

Last night, in the deathly silence of a dark moon and cold wind, I suddenly had a dream.

I dreamed that I was wearing a black dress, draped in a long black veil, holding a small black flower, and I seemed to be lost in a desolate wilderness, hanging my head, and crying softly.

I forgot how long I cried, when suddenly, I heard a strange sound.

I felt surprised and delighted, because the sound seemed very familiar, and I felt surprised and delighted, because the sound seemed to be right above me. So I looked up and searched, and suddenly, my flesh and blood all boiled!

It was him! He was sitting on a high cloud, gently calling my name!

In an instant, I forgot everything, just staring at him! I saw him shedding tears for me, and he was waving to me. I also saw a thin rope hanging down from the cloud, but it did not hang down to my side, but hung in the distance where my hand could not reach. So I became anxious and shouted: "For you, even if I am crushed to pieces, I am willing!" and jumped up to grab the rope. However, just at that moment, with a bang, I woke up!

I woke up! I touched my eyes, and they were wet. My heart was pounding. I did not climb up to the cloud, nor was I crushed to pieces. I was hanging alone in the air, and my dream was over!

Ah! I am melancholy! Why did I have such a desolate dream in the deathly silence of a dark moon and cold wind?

### Twilight

— Sudan

The swallows have not yet come, this March twilight, the yellow and confused wind! Gently.

Gently cold, it is already the end of March, why is the spring cold still so bleak? I need some warm flames, like the color of peach blossoms blooming, can you tell me? When will the peach blossoms bloom?

When the swallows fly here, the peach blossoms will bloom!

Is that so? Then I must take this opportunity to rush to Jiangnan, waiting for the swallows to fly, waiting in Jiangnan, waiting for the swallows to fly, waiting for the blooming peach blossoms, warm flames.

Well. There will be a lush spring there, let alone the length of the journey, but are you not afraid of the difficult journey? Really, are you not afraid?

Ah! It is a light shake of the head, is this a strength, or an expectation?

I don't want to talk anymore, I should cherish my words, I have so much contemplation and meditation, let me learn from a friend, and learn his deep silence! He said this is gold.

I am remembering, dreaming, vaguely thinking about spring, it is the past, and it is also the future, that distant dream of the horizon, I also love spring.

Like the distant sound of bells from the graceful shepherdesses on the Jiangnan meadow, light.

Lightly ringing, you say: I tell you, tomorrow, maybe it's tomorrow, we have to set off before dawn!

Go! Go to catch up with the dawn, to chase after spring, and grasp the warmth and laughter.

The setting sun is going home, the sunset is thick, I want to give you a cloud of sunset, or give you a gust of twilight wind.

The swallows have not yet come, this March twilight, the twilight wind! Gently.

### Crossroads

— Yang Qiguang

Have you ever looked out at the crossroads? Have you ever found the directions of east, west, north, and south in the tide of people, the sea of people? Look, how many people are wandering in the middle! Tired and weak eyes, searching for a path, but where to go?

Now, there is no fog at the crossroads, not a trace of fog, only the dust from the chimneys, the mud stirred up by the rolling cars, the sighs of people… but you can push aside the stumbling blocks and seek your way!

It is very clear, when your eyes are not red and rotten from alcohol, and not intoxicated by the prosperity of the city, you will open your sharp eyes like a hawk, and seek a way in the crowd.

Going east from here is the noble street, with majestic buildings of gentry and landlords, and red palace walls waiting for you; going west, there are tired, sweating laborers; going south, there is sea breeze, the bright moon on the embankment, poems, and dreams of gold; north, there is biting sand, a bitter cold wind, a vast wilderness, and the people there have broad hearts, and kind faces...

How will you choose your path?

The crossroads are a whirlpool of flowing water, being rolled to the bottom, and then washed to the surface…

As for me? I am a person with a fixed direction, every day I walk in a certain direction, I know where my home is, where my companion is; where my friends are; where it will lead to my hopes and the other shore of my desires!

### Flying Together (March 8th)

— Zhao Qingge

Truly, Mrs. Weng the Second has become haggard and out of shape this year, which is also something that saddens her! Because of her bad mood and hard work, she naturally looks older than usual, and she no longer wears her usual fancy clothes. Therefore, she looks even more disheveled.

The two little girls stared at Mrs. Weng the Second, as if looking at a stranger.

"Xiaoyun! Why don't you call me Mom? Don't you recognize Mom?" Mrs. Weng the Second pulled Xiaoyun over and said in a trembling voice.

Xiaoyun didn't say anything. In Xiaoyun's memory, this was the first time Mrs. Weng the Second had called her so gently and lovingly, and caressed her. In her little heart, she was wondering if she could believe that this was the mother who had abandoned her! She was stunned for a while before twisting and calling out "Mom" unnaturally, but there was no enthusiastic expression.

Mrs. Weng the Second then pulled Lihua over and kissed Lihua's forehead affectionately, saying:

"This child is getting more and more beautiful! Are you studying?"

Lihua shook her head with a smile.

"Why don't you say anything, quickly call her Godfather!" Mrs. Mo pushed Lihua and said.

"Godfather!" Lihua also called out unnaturally. She no longer smiled, she felt sad in her heart at this moment, because she had not called "Dad" for a long time, and now, it stirred up her memories, her memories of Mr. Mo! She missed Mr. Mo again! She thought of Jingzhou, where Mr. Mo was buried, and the home that held countless memories of Mr. Mo!

Because of the words "Godfather," Mrs. Weng the Second immediately remembered Baoling, who would never call her Godfather, so she asked Mrs. Mo:

"Where's Baoling? Why didn't you bring him?"

"Sigh!" Mrs. Mo sighed before speaking. "Sister, don't mention him! This child is getting worse and worse, just like his father's temper when he was young, if he wants to go east, you must never let him go west. This is fate! I feel like I gave birth to this son for nothing!" Mrs. Mo's eyes were a little red when she said the last sentence.

"But Brother Mo became amiable later, Baoling will also become amiable in the future, young people always like to be willful," Mrs. Weng the Second comforted Mrs. Mo. There was a double meaning in what she said, because her Shi Wang Lou was also "willful."

After exchanging pleasantries for a while, Mrs. Weng the Second invited Mrs. Mo and her daughters to sit in the house. Mrs. Mo glanced around the environment of this house, and instinctively made her immediately concerned about Mrs. Weng the Second's life.

"How is Boss Shi? How are things going lately?"

"Hard to say! Hard to say!" Mrs. Weng the Second answered Mrs. Mo appropriately using a familiar Peking opera line. This sentence contained thousands of inner feelings!

Mrs. Weng the Second took some candy and arranged for the two little sisters, Lihua and Xiaoyun, to go to the outer room. She and Mrs. Mo, the two old sisters, sat in the inner room to talk.

The grievances of the past year and more, the torment of the past year and more, burst out like a river that had broken its banks, and Mrs. Weng the Second poured out her heart to Mrs. Mo without any concealment. Naturally, there was also sweetness in the bitterness; there was also happiness in the sorrow; but ultimately, the sweetness and happiness were less than the bitterness and sorrow, especially recently. Some of Mrs. Weng the Second's happy expectations had now almost completely shattered! She no longer tried for anything, she just hoped to quietly accompany Shi Yulou for the rest of her life. She abandoned Mr. Weng because she hated Mr. Weng, but she couldn't bear Shi Yulou abandoning her, because she loved Shi Yulou. She certainly understood that Shi Yulou's recent bad temper was due to his poor situation, but she was also afraid that Shi Yulou had changed his mind! Therefore, she often felt worried about her own aging appearance.

"I never thought that I would still be suffering so much torment now! But I endured it! Because I feel satisfied as long as he is by my side. It would be fine if it could continue like this, as long as no other problems arise," Mrs. Weng the Second said, her eyes becoming a little wet again.

"What you said is true, this is fate! We can only resign ourselves to fate. I think Boss Shi is not a cunning person, if you are so devoted to him, he will not let you down," Mrs. Mo comforted Mrs. Mo with sympathy. There was a feeling of infinite emotion in her tone.

### Mouth Flute

— Chen Gan

The bright moon is gradually rising. The little children in the village gathered under the big tree, and after singing simple, rambling folk songs in unison, they were listening to the melodious sound of the mouth flute. The desolate and mournful sound waves, floating in the boundless space, made the stars with their ghostly eyes even brighter.
