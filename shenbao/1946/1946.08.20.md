江南 Banditry Rampant, Suzhou and Jintan Under Martial Law, Small Group of New Fourth Army Discovered in Changshu County

\[This newspaper, Wuxi, 19th\] In the Liyang Garden area of Changshu County, about seven li from the Ganlu Town of Dongxiang, about six or seven hundred men and women of Sun Huifeng's unit of the New Fourth Army have arrived recently. They have several light machine guns and are all dressed in civilian clothes. It is said that they crossed from the ports of Fushan, Baimao, and Hupu in Changshu.

\[This newspaper, Suzhou, Communication\] The city defense headquarters reported that some communist troops have already infiltrated Suzhou, disguised as monks, Taoists, and vendors, attempting to disrupt public order. A temporary martial law order was issued on the 17th, dividing the entire city into four police defense zones. In the Banxu Pan police defense zone, traffic will be cut off every night from 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM the next morning, and surprise inspections will be conducted simultaneously. In the city and other areas, ordinary precautions will still be taken.

### Zhang Qun Denies Trip to Guling, Says Lushan Talk Conference Was a Rumor

\[This newspaper, Guling, 19th] Regarding the news about the Lushan Talk Conference, a qualified person said that the government had considered this in the past, but due to many difficulties in transportation and technical support, the time seemed too rushed before the National Congress on November 12th. It seems credible that the government will convene university presidents and others to Lushan for an informal talk conference in the near future.

\[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th] Zhang Qun, director of the Chongqing Provisional Headquarters, met with reporters on the 18th and made the following brief remarks:

(Question) It has been rumored that the Lushan Talk Conference has been decided to convene, and it is said that its nature is equivalent to the Political Consultative Conference. What is the director's opinion?

(Answer) I believe that the convening of the Huishan Talk Conference will not become a reality. In President Chiang's statement on the 14th, he clearly stated that the government's approach to peaceful resolution has always been consistent. The implementation of the Political Consultative Conference's resolutions and the promotion of democratic constitutionalism will not change due to changes in the political situation or differences in party opinions. Therefore, I dare to say that all rumors from the outside are unfounded.

(Question) It is heard that the director has been summoned to Gu Ling. Is the time set?

(Answer) I have not been summoned, nor do I intend to go to Gu Ling. The rumors about my whereabouts are not true. Now, due to the receiving and repatriation work of the Provisional Headquarters, I will not leave Chongqing for the time being.

(Question) Reports say that the director's trip to Kunming has been canceled. Is that true?

(Answer) At the beginning of the establishment of the Provisional Headquarters, I intended to visit Kunming and Guiyang. Now, due to obstacles, I cannot travel for the time being, but I have no intention of canceling it.

### Marshal Ma and Minister Yu Return to Nanjing Separately, Making a Final Effort for Peace in China, Minister Yu Talks About Difficulties in Restoring Transportation

\[This newspaper, Guling, 19th] It is heard that Marshal Marshall is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 20th. Unless necessary, the itinerary will not be changed. According to well-informed sources, Marshal Ma and Stuart are once again stepping into the capital, intending to make a final effort for peace in China with the faith of a religious humanitarian.

\[This newspaper, Beiping, 19th] Marshal Ma's five-star plane arrived at the Beiping West Suburb Airport on the 19th to spend the night, quietly waiting for Special Envoy Stuart to return to Nanjing on the morning of the 20th.

\[Central News Agency, Beiping, 19th] U.S. Ambassador Stuart Leiden is scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the morning of the 20th, accompanied by U.S. Assistant Secretary of the Army Patterson, Marshal Ma's staff member He Qisen, and the ambassador's private advisor Fu Jingbo. In addition to bringing his favorite antiques, including calligraphy, paintings, and ancient porcelain, the ambassador is also taking about one-fifth of his entire book collection, indicating his intention to stay in Nanjing for a long time, but he will still return to Beiping from time to time.

\[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] On the 17th, party-based political activities in Nanjing almost completely ceased. Zhou Enlai has not gone out for days. There is no sign of the widely rumored Communist Party statement. The Communist Party is quietly waiting for the development of the overall situation. Judging from the current Communist military offensive, even if Marshal Ma returns to Nanjing, peace talks may not be restored immediately.

\[This newspaper, Guling, 19th] Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei visited Marshal Ma twice on the morning of the 19th at 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM. It is heard that they discussed the issue of restoring transportation and the various difficulties encountered in restoring domestic transportation and the unbearable suffering of the Chinese people due to transportation disruptions. It is heard that Yu will return to Nanjing in one or two days. According to an observer, the government is determined to restore domestic transportation. Judging from the current situation, the Jiaoji Line may be fully opened to traffic before September 15. As for the project of fully opening the Jinpu Line, most of the road repair workers are now concentrated on that line. If there are no unexpected difficulties, it can definitely be repaired before November 12 this year. It is heard that the documents from the provinces of North China and East China requesting the restoration of the Jinpu Road are overflowing, which shows that people across the country are eagerly awaiting the restoration of transportation.

\[Central News Agency, Guling, 19th] Yu Dawei continued to visit Marshal Ma at 10:00 AM on the 19th, and then visited President Chiang at noon. After leaving the residence, he told reporters that the road to restoring transportation is full of thorns. The destroyed ones have not been repaired, and the ones that have been opened have been damaged again. The Xuzhou-Zhengzhou section of the Longhai Road has been dismantled by the Communist army and has not been opened to traffic for several days.

### Gold Prices Fluctuate Greatly in Various Places, Peaking at 315,000 in the Capital, All Prices in Lanzhou are Rising

\[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The increase in the exchange rate has greatly stimulated the Nanjing market. The prices of gold, banknotes, and various commodities are very chaotic.

Although it did not set a new record, it was on par with the peak in the first half of the year. After 5:00 PM, it stabilized at 250,000 yuan.

Although it is close to the school season, stationery prices have not fluctuated significantly. Some stores are busy changing price tags, but business is generally sluggish except for department stores, which seems to be related to the decline in general purchasing power.

\[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] After the government's decision to adjust the exchange rate was announced in Shanghai last night, the Central Bank notified various banks in Nanjing to stop buying and selling foreign exchange this morning around 7:00 AM.

### Minister of Finance Yu Delivers a Speech, Warning Merchants Not to Speculate, Pan Xulun Says New Measures are of Great Benefit to Industry and Commerce

\[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] "After exempting export taxes on goods allowed to be exported, the adjustment of foreign exchange rates is part of the government's financial, economic, and industrial policies." This was the statement made by Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun to visiting reporters on the afternoon of the 19th. Yu stated that this move can revive China's industry and commerce, promote production, and encourage exports, so that China's international trade balance will gradually be balanced. Minister Yu finally solemnly stated that the export tax exemption stipulated this time refers to the export tax on goods allowed to be exported. Goods that are not allowed to be exported are still subject to government control and will not be allowed to be exported.

\[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun gave a speech today on the re-adjustment of foreign exchange rates: He warned merchants that if they take the opportunity to speculate, they will inevitably suffer losses in the future, so he advised merchants to adopt a calm attitude. Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Pan Xulun also gave a speech, believing that the benefits to industry and commerce after the implementation of this new method are substantial. The difficulties of industry and commerce can be said to have been completely resolved by the government. In the future, it will only depend on the efforts of the industrial and commercial circles themselves. If they can work hard to "improve production efficiency and reduce production costs," they can take a stable path. Pan believes that some domestic goods are not necessities, and even if they rise in price, consumers can save money without being adversely affected. However, the prices of daily necessities such as rice, coal, and cloth should be kept stable. Another foreign exchange expert said that exchange rates are closely related to prices. This exchange rate adjustment will inevitably cause prices to fluctuate, especially in the first three or four days, but after this period, they will naturally return to stability. It is also heard that the government's decision to adjust foreign exchange this time was presided over by President Song, and Minister Yu did not receive notification until last night. Senior officials of the Ministry did not know about it until they read the newspaper this morning.

\[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] It is heard that this new economic measure is one of President Song's three economic movements. Currently, it is in the second stage. When the three movements are completed, the foundation of China's economy will be stable.

\[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Although the new economic and financial measures adopted by the government this time are not the direct result of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Petition Group's visit to Nanjing, it is heard that they are related to the earnest requests made by the group.

### Purpose of Implementing the New Exchange Rate: To Support the Development of Industry and Commerce, Bei Zuyi Explains Various Issues of Exchange Rate Adjustment

\[This newspaper's report] President of the Central Bank, Bei Zuyi, hosted the city's press corps at 4:30 PM yesterday in the president's office. He answered various questions raised by reporters from various newspapers regarding the adjustment of foreign exchange rates. The main points are recorded as follows: (1) Purpose of adjusting the exchange rate: (A) To support domestic industry and commerce and encourage production; (B) To assist in the export of Chinese goods and reduce imports. President Song had already given a detailed written explanation of all these points the day before, so there is no need to repeat them. The authorities have been considering this decision for a long time and it was not decided overnight and then implemented. The reason why it was not launched until today is that the authorities are confident about the current prices of various commodities, so they resolutely implemented the adjustment. Bei also explained that the exchange rate adjustment was implemented to comply with reality because prices had already started to rise. Anyone with a patriotic heart should understand that this decision is to support the export of domestic goods and does not affect domestic prices. It is hoped that all sectors of society will work together to stabilize prices and achieve the goal together. (2) Regarding the price of gold, the Central Bank has sufficient gold to supply the needs as much as possible, so it is determined not to allow the price to rise, so as to avoid stimulating price increases. If the price is deliberately raised, the price raiser will bear the consequences. Bei also put forward a saying: If the price of gold rises and the market causes a tightening of funds again, resulting in a turmoil, do not complain that the Central Bank "does not help when it sees death." As for the method of fixing the price of gold at a certain level without limiting the supply, the Central Bank found it to be unsatisfactory based on past experience, so it made the decision to supply it according to the market today. (3) The situation of supplying foreign exchange in the past five months: (A) Foreign exchange was never supplied for goods that were not allowed to be imported (such as luxury goods). (B) Among the various imported goods for which foreign exchange was supplied, raw cotton ranked first, followed by paper, and then pigments and medicines. (4) Regarding the foreign exchange settlement method for machines and other imports, the Central Bank specifically pointed out two points: (A) Importing manufacturers can find ways to purchase domestic or foreign frozen foreign exchange (of which domestic frozen foreign exchange is limited to clearing before the end of September this year). It is most appropriate to purchase the frozen foreign exchange to pay for machines and other goods imported for a considerable period of time. (B) If American manufacturers sell machines to Chinese factories, it is hoped that the American manufacturers can cooperate more with the Chinese factories. After the Chinese factories sign the order, they can wait until three months before the goods are shipped to the Central Bank to settle the necessary foreign exchange. (5) Other trivial answers: (A) It is hoped that overseas remittances can be increased after the adjustment of foreign exchange rates. The Central Bank is taking measures to curb the current escape of funds (especially to Hong Kong). (B) Although the exchange rate against the British pound has not been officially announced, importing merchants can still settle the exchange with designated banks according to market supply and demand. (C) The Central Bank will not use a penny of the US$500 million in foreign exchange reserves. (D) If the settled but unused foreign exchange is not needed, it can be settled back to the Central Bank according to the adjusted new exchange rate. From August 19, all US exchange settlements will be calculated according to the new exchange rate.

### Treatment of Military Personnel to be Readjusted Soon

\[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] It is learned that the treatment of military personnel will be readjusted soon. The amount of increase has been drafted by relevant parties. It is heard that it will be an increase of 60% or 100%, which will be implemented after approval by the highest authorities.

### Financial Experts Point Out: Legal Tender Has Dual Value

\[Central News Agency, Guling, 19th] A financial expert pointed out that the legal tender originally has dual value. One is the external value, which depends on the level of the foreign exchange rate, and the other is the internal value, which depends on the prices of domestic goods. There are close relationships between the two, and there are also those that are not connected. For example, some imported goods and export products, because they are bought and sold with foreign exchange, will naturally rise in price with the increase in foreign exchange. But this is exactly what we hope for, because the rise in the price of imported products and the decline in purchasing power can reduce our imports, and the rise in the price of export products and the enthusiasm of producers can increase our exports. Some domestic products and major necessities of life that have nothing to do with foreign exchange at all, such as firewood, rice, oil, salt, and meat, should not be turbulent due to the increase in foreign exchange rates. The government's purpose of this measure is to develop production, encourage export trade, and improve the current economic situation. All citizens should sincerely support it. Another observer told reporters that the decision to increase the foreign exchange rate this time was made half a month ago by President Song, Bei Zuyi, and Yang Ge at a meeting in Guling. Until Minister Peng announced President Song's statement, the domestic financial market remained stable from beginning to end, which shows the government's wisdom in handling this matter.

### Tungsten and Antimony Control Regulations to be Abolished by the Legislative Yuan

\[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Regarding the export of tungsten and antimony ore, which was controlled by the Assets Committee during the war, the price difference between imports and exports was too large, and in recent years, many miners have closed down due to insufficient costs.

\[This newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] In order to promote cooperative enterprises, the Cooperative Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Social Affairs, in addition to establishing a demonstration cooperative farm in Jiangning County, also plans to select a county in Jiangsu Province as a demonstration county. The county magistrate and administrative staff must have cooperative knowledge and enthusiasm.

### Bizarre Fraud Case in Hankou, Main Culprit Escorted for Parade

\[This newspaper, Hankou, 19th] Another main culprit in the sensational bizarre fraud case in Hankou has been discovered to be Wang Yifei, the godson-in-law of Zhang Feng. Wang once served as the director of the Political Training Department of the Pseudo-12th Division. He was a military traitor who was free from justice. In the fraud case, Wang was responsible for upper-level activities, Zhang Feng was responsible for engaging middle-level women, and Liu Shidi, the goddess of the Zhang Feng, summoned lower-level citizens. Therefore, the scope of the association was very broad. After learning of this situation, the creditors immediately twisted Zhang Feng to Wang Yifei and his wife yesterday, and then escorted the three people to parade on Zhongshan Avenue. A strip of paper was pasted on Wang's chest with the words "Big Swindler Wang Yifei." Four strong men held him in front and shouted, "Please see the 130 million big swindler." Wang's wife and Zhang Feng were surrounded by four female creditors behind. There were more than 200 creditors of both sexes following, each holding a stick of incense, looking like a petition. The viewers were like a wall. After the parade, they were sent to the military law office of the garrison for detention and handling.

### Editorial: Reason is Valued During Price Fluctuations!

Since the US dollar was raised yesterday, general prices have shown a mysterious fluctuation. This is inevitable and unavoidable in the early stages of exchange rate adjustment.

However, in the midst of emotional impulses, we must not lose our reason. The rise and fall of prices will ultimately not escape the control of the law of cause and effect. This is an undeniable fact. Then, after shouting and screaming, we must advise those who want to hoard foreign goods to carefully examine how these goods are sold. After the price is raised, is there a real market? If they hoard blindly, what about their own funds and dismantling interest?

As for general domestic goods, the cost is too high, and the market price is very different from foreign goods. They cannot be sold, so they ask for relief and hope that the government will raise the exchange rate. The government adopted the suggestion, and if the domestic merchants follow the trend and also raise the selling price, will the goods be sold smoothly and solve their crisis? Will this increase their competitiveness and compete with foreign goods for a day's worth of business? The result of raising the selling price will undoubtedly offset the benefits obtained from the extended foreign exchange. In other words, it is equivalent to the foreign exchange not being extended, and the domestic industry and commerce cannot stand on their own feet. So, will they ask the government to extend the exchange rate again? Another round of price increases, and further stifle themselves?

The most difficult to understand is especially the daily necessities of general local products, such as rice, noodles, oil, sugar, etc. These goods have no relationship with foreign exchange at all, and the government obviously holds considerable control power. Why do confused merchants also engage in indiscriminate price increases? Without asking whether the government's reserves are sufficient and can be released in large quantities at any time, giving the hoarders a fatal blow, it is to implement price restrictions and distribute them at any time. At that time, what profit can the domestic merchants make?

We originally knew that speculation is blind and unreasonable, but we must remind those who have been blinded by speculation in recent years that the natural adjustment of supply and demand is also ruthless. Don't be too happy to take the opportunity to raise prices too high. You must know that the general trend is that the reaction after the price increase is probably unavoidable. Therefore, I hope that the general speculators and hoarders will quickly clear their minds, restore their reason, and not eat their own bitter fruit!

### The Crisis of Internal Strife in India

Since Jawaharlal Nehru, chairman of the Indian National Congress Party, accepted the suggestion of Indian Governor-General Wavell and started to organize the Indian interim government, the Muslims in India have been holding demonstrations in major Indian cities under the slogan of "Pakistan" (partition of India and Pakistan) promoted by the Muslim League, opposing the plan to organize the interim government. As a result, the Muslim frenzy has spread across India like wildfire and is showing an increasing trend. The 17th was designated by the Muslims as "Direct Action Day," and riots were held in Calcutta, clashing with local military police. The development continued on the 18th. In the past three days, the casualties were generally over 600 dead and over 2,500 injured. The shadow of internal strife has enveloped the entire of India. Although Nehru and Muslim League leader Jinnah unanimously condemned the atrocities and some shouted "United Indian and Muslim people," some Muslims insisted even more strongly on the "No division, rather civil war" stance, which has made us focus closely on the crisis of internal strife in India. Especially since China and India are both ancient Asian civilizations, the governance and chaos in India can affect the safety of Asia directly and indirectly. Therefore, the increasingly serious situation in India in the past few days is another focus of attention for the world.

Indeed, as a political action, there is no way that riots and disturbances can achieve political goals. The results of unprincipled political behavior are bound to be failure. The destruction of order may create terror and produce the effect of a very small number of people controlling a majority, but this destructive behavior is bound to be stopped and its planned intentions will be defeated. This is clearly a crime against disrupting public order. As Jinnah said, it should be severely punished by the law. If such base atrocities could achieve their goals, then what would be the point of law and order, and what would be the point of right and wrong? As Nehru said, these "thug tactics" can never decide all national events! In order to maintain order and discipline, we believe that the outbreak of these riots and disturbances cannot be sympathized with by the general public in any case. Without taking legal avenues, without adopting legitimate means to make reasonable demands, but only destroying the status quo, India may not be able to gain independence.

However, the unrest in India also has its natural social background. While we should condemn the impropriety of riots and disturbances, we cannot but understand why they were launched, and seek ways to thoroughly eliminate them. Nehru's assumption of the task of organizing the government is just an excuse for unrest, and there are various historical and social factors that have created it. In general, the incompatibility between the Hindu and Muslim people, and the deep hatred between them. Hindus have a very strong sense of class, which is very different from the Muslim emphasis on equality; in addition, due to different customs, there is a very deep gap between India and Islam. In northern India, due to historical reasons, there are even more Muslims. Because of these reasons, the Muslim League led by Jinnah advocated the partition of India and the separate construction of an independent "Pakistan" outside of India. However, this request was not accepted by Hindus - that is, members of the Congress Party, so that negotiations on the issue of India's status have not been able to reach an agreement.

Britain has also worked hard to mediate the conflict between India and Islam. Especially during the war, Britain sent the enlightened politician Cripps to India, trying every possible means, but could not break the deadlock. Last year, Governor-General Wavell proposed a new proposal, which was even more progressive, but it still failed due

Dr. Wu Qiyuan to Lecture in England Expresses Current Economic Views at a Public Banquet for Wang Xinggong [Report from our office] The Shanghai Alumni Association of Wuhan University held a public banquet for former President Wang Xinggong the night before last, as previously reported in this newspaper. It is understood that Dr. Wu Qiyuan, former professor of economics who will be lecturing in England, and Zuo Xuejiong, an alumnus who is going to the United States to study aviation, were also present at the time. During the banquet, Wang Xinggong spoke about the ten thousand alumni of Wuhan University cultivated over the past twenty years, and his relationship with the school. He is currently the president of Sun Yat-sen University, which was founded by the Father of the Nation and is the most prestigious institution of higher learning. It is also one of the most magnificent campuses in Asia, located at one end of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, while Wuhan University is located at the other, both serving as standard universities in China. He also said that Sun Yat-sen University had been relocated several times during the war and had only moved back to its original site in Shipai, Guangzhou, last autumn, causing considerable damage to its vitality. The recovery will take time, and the enrollment of students in early September may not be possible in Beijing and Shanghai. Dr. Wu Qiyuan then expressed his views, lamenting the current economic crisis. He believed that the fundamental solution to the emergency was to re-examine and determine the country's economic policy, otherwise the economic future would not be optimistic. Dr. Wu is currently a professor at Tsinghua University and also serves as a consultant to the Executive Yuan. He has published many papers in recent years and is a leading authority on economic issues in the country. He has recently been invited by the British Council and the London School of Economics to go to England in the middle of next month.

Attendees included the camp director, deputy director, staff, and all students. The meeting was chaired by Li, Deputy Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, with Yu Jilin as the recorder. After a brief report by the chairman, Mayor Wu gave a speech, stating: "Now that we are promoting national education, everyone knows it is an extremely important task. Today, I want to talk about three points: First, regarding the concept of the nation and national consciousness, I feel that many people in Shanghai are too superficial. This is probably because they were deeply poisoned by the enemy and puppet regimes during the occupation. I hope that all principals will pay attention to training children in schools in the future, emphasizing the concept of the nation and national consciousness, so that the next generation of citizens will develop the habit of loving the country and the community. Second, the current general atmosphere in the country is too bad. To correct the bad atmosphere, we must start in schools. Third, President Chiang has repeatedly emphasized the importance of understanding propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. This is not just empty talk. Everyone in the country must pay attention to it. Now, all of you principals who bear the mission of education, whether the next generation of citizens will be healthy and whether the country can be prosperous, all responsibility rests on your shoulders. I hope you will pay close attention to and work hard on the above three points."

Paris Football Season Begins Players Find Ways to Make Money [Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, Paris, 18th] The French football season began today in pouring rain, resulting in a one-sided situation. Athletes are eagerly awaiting the fierce competition between strong teams from all over the country, with many teams bringing in foreign players and North African players to strengthen their lineups.

The Ministry of Education Orders the Jiangsu Department of Education to Rectify Local Education Funding and Orders Improvement of Elementary School Teacher Salaries [Report from our Zhenjiang office] The Ministry of Education recently issued an order to the Jiangsu Department of Education, stating in brief: The province's local education had a considerable foundation before the war. After the recovery, it has been unable to restore its former facilities due to financial difficulties. As the popularization of national education is being actively promoted, there must be a thorough improvement in local education funding in order to make smooth progress. The urgent improvements are listed as follows: (1) The county's local education funding should be established in accordance with the regulations as a special fund committee. In addition to the original school funds and school properties, the sources of funds allocated should still follow the established cases of previous years for the additional land tax, deed tax, stamp tax, and various taxes designated as education funding, and be allocated in proportion to current income. This case has been approved by the National Defense Supreme Committee and has been forwarded by the Ministry in March of the 34th year of the Republic for compliance. (2) If the above method is difficult to implement temporarily due to changes in the fiscal revenue and expenditure system, the percentage of education funding in the county's total funding in the 25th year before the war can be determined, and the current percentage of education funding in each county's total funding should be increased by a certain percentage each year. (3) The original school funds and school properties should be effectively reorganized, and the increased income after reorganization should still be used for education in accordance with the regulations, to improve teacher salaries and enrich school equipment. (4) The salaries of elementary school teachers in the province are set at 140 times, and the living allowance is 35,000 yuan. However, the cost of living has generally risen in various places, and the aforementioned regulations have not been fully complied with, and there are arrears in some cases, which should be effectively investigated and improved. All of the above points should be strictly complied with and reported. After receiving the order, the department has ordered the education bureaus of each county to comply with the order. Brief News on Civil Affairs Documents Submitted by the People Should Have Sufficient Stamps Affixed The Municipal Government Orders Its Subordinate Agencies to Comply The Municipal Government received an order from the Executive Yuan, based on a report from the Ministry of Finance stating that, according to the provisions of the Stamp Tax Law, documents submitted by the people or public and private organizations to government agencies should have stamp tax affixed at a rate of ten yuan per document. In fact, there are often cases where stamp tax is not affixed to submitted documents, and the receiving government agencies do not effectively correct this, resulting in a significant loss of tax revenue each year. It is proposed that all agencies be notified to instruct the public or private organizations to affix stamps in full compliance with the current stamp tax rate table, item 14, for application forms and receipts, and to cancel the stamps. When receiving documents, the receiving personnel of each agency should be responsible for checking the stamps. If there is any omission, short-affixation, failure to cancel the stamps, or reuse of stamps, the document should be rejected and returned to the submitter for correction, in order to comply with the regulations and increase treasury revenue. After receiving the order, the Municipal Government forwarded it to its subordinate agencies for compliance yesterday.

The date of the meeting for mediation referred to in the preceding paragraph shall not exceed ten days for civil matters and five days for criminal matters from the date of acceptance of the application.

Market Fluctuations in Various Cities After the Central Bank Announced the New Exchange Rate, Calm Expected Soon After the Central Bank formally announced the new exchange rate of 3350 at 10:00 AM yesterday, Director Lin Fengbao of the bank's Operations Bureau and Director Lin Weiying of the Foreign Exchange Examination Department stated that all foreign exchange control measures remain unchanged. The procedures for applying for and examining foreign exchange remain the same. For foreign exchange that has been approved for buying and selling in the past, those that have already been settled will remain the same. Those that have not yet been settled will be settled at the announced new exchange rate from yesterday. Notice No. 52 has been issued to notify all designated banks to comply. In addition, the interest rate for forward exchange was originally set at a higher rate than requested. The government adopted and announced the implementation of this higher rate, and the industrial and export industries should be able to improve in the future. Therefore, fellow industrialists and businessmen should act in good conscience and not raise prices casually. Otherwise, the meaning of foreign exchange adjustment will be lost. If the foreign exchange adjustment stimulates commodity prices, it is unreasonable and should not happen. It is reported that the municipal chamber of commerce will convene an emergency meeting of the responsible persons of various industry associations to convey the government's intentions, exert organizational power, and prevent various industries from raising prices casually due to the foreign exchange adjustment. At a time when the prices of labor and food have not changed, there is no reason to raise prices. Any deliberate violations will not be protected by the industry associations. Gold Prices Reached a High of 2.9 Million, Closing at 2.32 Million The exchange rate adjustment announced yesterday caused speculation that it might be raised to 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Therefore, the market immediately bid 2.6 million to buy and 2.65 million to sell. After the opening, many parties took profits, and the bid was lowered by one level to 2.55 million to 2.6 million. However, buyers were excited, and demand exceeded supply. At this time, the US dollar market bid much higher in the chaos, with 38,000 yuan to buy and 42,000 yuan to sell. If calculated at 750 yuan per week for ten taels, the gold price was not too high. The buying frenzy rekindled, and the bid was raised to 2.9 million before settling down. Many profitable bulls poured out, and the Central Bank exerted strong pressure, forcing a retreat. Subsequently, news spread that the Central Bank would adjust the price according to the market, with the highest price not exceeding 2.7 million, causing a sharp decline. After 10:00 AM, the bank allocated to the 194 gold businesses registered with it at a price of 2.65 million. After this, buying interest was slightly hit and fell below 2.6 million. However, as the buying and selling prices were too far apart, the market easily rebounded. At noon, it rose again to around 2.68 million. In the afternoon, the Central Bank vigorously supplied, causing a sharp decline to close at 2.32 million. As a result, it rose sharply by 300,500 compared to last Saturday. Ornamental gold rose to 50,000, silver thread 2,500, and silver dollars also rose to above 1,500. The black market interest rate initially rose and then fell, ranging from one to one and a half cents. US Dollar Rises Sharply by 670 Yuan, Hong Kong Dollars and British Exchange Follow Suit Foreign currencies were also affected by the adjustment of the US exchange rate, and were generally in much greater demand. The US dollar only opened slightly in the chaos after the gold market opened at 9:00 AM. Money changers found it difficult to cope, and the buying and selling prices were quite far apart. The initial bids were 3,800 to buy and 4,200 to sell. However, as this price was too far from the new exchange rate, it was soon suppressed by the release of dollars, and gradually fell from around 4,000 yuan to a buying price of 3,200 yuan before settling down. After the official exchange rate of 3,350 yuan was announced at 10:00 AM, the black market dollar price immediately rose. At noon, it struggled between 3,500 yuan and 3,700 yuan. In the afternoon, it declined slightly, but finally struggled above the official rate. As a result, it rose sharply by 670 yuan compared to last Saturday. Hong Kong dollars were bid as high as 770 yuan, and then slightly stabilized, resulting in a rise of 165 yuan compared to last Saturday. Hong Kong exchange rose from 680 yuan to 730 yuan, Indian exchange fell from 900 yuan to 860 yuan, British exchange from 11,000 to 12,000, and the exchange rate between US banks ranged from 3,340 yuan to 3,370 yuan. Ministry of Finance Reiterates Prohibition Gold Cannot Be Mortgaged Silver Money Businesses Must Comply The two silver money industry associations, in order to comply with the Ministry of Finance's telegram No. 2838, stated: "The Ministry reiterates the prohibition of gold mortgages (Ministry of Finance Money B No. 219 order). Due to postal delays, a few silver money businesses in the city have distorted and misinterpreted the order, mistakenly believing that gold is still allowed to be mortgaged. This is completely inappropriate. The associations should immediately inform all member businesses to pay close attention and strictly abide by the previous order, and not to engage in gold mortgage loans again." After receiving this order, the two associations notified all member businesses yesterday to comply. Tight Supply of Woolen Goods The trend of woolen goods and serge in the market yesterday suddenly turned tight. Most of the well-funded merchants temporarily refrained from quoting prices for most of their goods, due to the change in the Central Bank's exchange rate and the soaring gold prices. In particular, American Melton stimulated the market even faster, jumping from 17,000 yuan on Saturday to 20,000 yuan yesterday. The standards for other goods were chaotic, and most were exaggerating the situation. The actual sales strength is still difficult to predict. A Glimpse of Industry and Commerce's Views Those Who Have Placed Orders but Not Settled Exchange Hope for Accommodation [Report from our office] The Central Bank adjusted the exchange rate yesterday. This reporter interviewed import-export and industrial and commercial circles in the city on this matter. The following is a summary of their opinions: (1) Adjusting the exchange rate is sufficient to stimulate export goods. Because the exchange rate adjustment devalues our currency, the prices of our export goods in the international market are lower than before, which can also stimulate the international market's demand for our export goods. (2) Strive to stabilize various domestic prices to avoid affecting production costs and increasing the cost of export goods. (3) The Central Bank is still expected to provide assistance for various imported goods for which letters of credit have been opened but exchange has not yet been settled. Judging from the proportion of Shanghai's import and export goods in the past six months, which is a ratio of 18 to 1, it can be seen that a very large number of importers are involved. For the sake of considering the difficulties of merchants, it is still hoped that foreign exchange will be sold at the previous exchange rate. (4) Adjusting the exchange rate is just one of the important measures to revitalize industry and commerce and stimulate the export industry. The fundamental solution still requires increasing production and stabilizing the currency value. High Asking Prices for Yarn and Cloth Very Few Formal Transactions Yesterday, the yarn market was stimulated by the exchange rate adjustment and saw a surge in prices, but sales were very weak. At the beginning of the morning, the market was very weak, and the initial asking price for "Double Horse" yarn was 1.7 million, but there were no buyers. Subsequently, a transaction was made at 1.6 million. The asking prices for other counts were extremely high, and very few transactions were made. In general, the opening prices were about 10% to 15% higher than at the end of last week. Judging from the relationship between flower clothing raw materials and foreign exchange, the yarn price does not seem to have risen enough. However, the purchasing power of inland villages and towns is extremely weak, which is the biggest obstacle to the progress of yarn prices. Moreover, the prices of yarn and thread sold by the Yarn Construction Office at noon were similar to the previous period, with very little increase, which is very different from the previous practice of increasing or decreasing with the market. It is expected that the yarn price will not change much in the next few days. Due to the authorities' adjustment of the exchange rate, the cloth market was chaotic, and cloth prices initially rose and then fell, but actual transactions did not develop. At the beginning of the morning, "V" leading cloth was 60,000 yuan, but retreated to 58,000 yuan at noon. "Four Gentlemen" serge was 55,000 yuan, but was 56,000 yuan at noon. Shilin cloth had no market transactions at all, because the asking prices of buyers and sellers were inconsistent, resulting in no transactions. As a result, the market rose by more than 2,000 yuan compared to the weekend, but the situation weakened in the afternoon. Bond Market Relatively Quiet Public Prices Still Peaceful, Market Conditions Slightly Deserted Although the "Tong Bing" opened in the morning rising to 1,400 yuan, a high price of 1,500 yuan was seen, but because the bond market and the exchange market have no direct relationship, there were frequent releases at high prices, retreating to 1,150 yuan in the middle of the day, and finally hovering around 1,250 yuan. As a result, there was no significant change compared to last Saturday. "Jia" and "Yi" fell slightly by 20 yuan, "Ding" fell by 130 yuan, while "Tong Wu" rose by 50 yuan. Silk Prices Soar Yesterday's silk prices jumped sharply, but there were no transactions. Factories were asking for 3.8 million per load for B-grade and 3.6 million for C-grade, calculated according to the new exchange rate based on overseas telegrams. The local foreign firms planning to purchase were offering 3.35 million for B-grade and 3.15 million for C-grade. Stock Market Sees Strong Buying Interest, Market Prices Rise Across the Board Stimulated by gold and dollars, the foreign stock market saw strong buying interest. Yi Yarn immediately jumped to 10,500 yuan at the opening in the morning. There was some profit-taking, and it fell to 10,000 yuan. However, the bottom price was too cheap, and buyers flocked to buy, pushing the price to 11,200 yuan. British Union rose from 10,500 yuan to around 11,500 yuan, Jardine Matheson rose from 16,000 yuan to above 18,000 yuan, and other stocks also followed suit. Smaller stocks were even more popular, and rose even more sharply. Securities firms struggled to cut profits in the middle of the day, but as a result, Yi Yarn, British Union, and Ye Guang all rose by about 15%, Jardine Matheson rose by 20%, Yi Beer, Paper, and Asia all rose by 25% to 30%, and Steel rose by more than 40%. The Chinese stock market was extremely chaotic, and there was some squeezing of short positions in futures trading. The opening of the market was delayed until 10:00 AM. Yong Yarn and Mei Ya, the two major hot stocks, saw a large amount of absorption, and spot buyers scrambled to buy. Initially, there was only demand and no supply. When Yong Yarn bid as high as 700 yuan and Mei Ya bid as high as 4,000 yuan, more widespread transactions began to be seen. The three small hot stocks rose, but the situation was still calm. At this time, as the stocks had risen too much, there was also a surge of physical goods. Yong Yarn quickly fell back from around 710 yuan and Mei Ya from around 4,050 yuan, but large-scale trading occurred around Yong Yarn at 685 yuan and Mei Ya at 3,850 yuan, with more large investors selling. Near noon, short covering suddenly rose, and the buying frenzy turned fierce in the short squeeze. As a result, all stocks ended at high prices. Compared to last Saturday, Yong Yarn rose by 20%, Mei Ya rose by nearly 30%, Jingfu rose by 20%, and Xinguang and Qinxing each rose by about 15%. The less popular medium and small stocks also rose sharply by 10% to 20%. The long-established stocks were more expensive, and only rose by about 5%. Rice Market Sees Scarce Goods and High Prices Grain Examination Meeting Price Remains Unchanged Flour, Miscellaneous Grains, and Oils Soar Together After the authorities announced the adjustment of the foreign exchange rate, citizens were generally afraid of rising prices and rushed to buy rice. The Grain Price Examination Meeting convened its 20th regular meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. The attendees unanimously believed that the price of white rice should not be changed due to the recent foreign exchange change, in order to avoid stimulating other prices. It was decided that the price of white rice determined by the 16th meeting would not be changed. The details are as follows: White Japonica Thin Paddy Rice: 58,000 yuan per stone, maximum retail price 63,500 yuan. Sheep Indica: 54,000 yuan per stone, maximum retail price 59,000 yuan. Port Indica: 47,000 yuan per stone, maximum retail price 51,500 yuan. Milled Indica: 42,000 yuan per stone, maximum retail price 46,000 yuan. White Indica: 37,000 yuan per stone, maximum retail price 40,500 yuan. Yesterday, the supply of rice in the north and south rice markets was scarce, with a total of more than 8,000 stones arriving. The price of Japonica rice rose slightly, and high-quality rice was very scarce. The situation of Indica rice was relatively stable due to the continued allocation of Brazilian rice. However, with the rise of foreign exchange and gold this morning, people were optimistic. In order to stabilize the market, the authorities released 13,000 bags of Brazilian rice. It is heard that a large amount of Brazilian and Vietnamese rice can still be allocated and sold today. Retail sales in flour stores were brisk, and prices rose sharply by more than 1,000 yuan. However, the market softened slightly at the close. Wheat from Shantou, Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Ningbo were all in demand, and inland prices were high, so buyers were very firm, and prices rose sharply by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Northern wheat was still being selected for white wheat, and the price also increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. New soybeans rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, new yellow sesame seeds soared by 5,000 yuan, old sesame seeds increased by 2,000 to 3,00

Free Talk: Mumbled Words Under Dim Light by Shao Fu

Tonight, the "Miss Shanghai" will be born.

Two hopes:

(1) All accounts should be made public to shut up those who spread gossip and pave a clear path for future charitable deeds.

(2) Those interested are welcome to join the fun. Those who are not interested can voluntarily send some money to the North Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association.

Foreign exchange rates have been readjusted.

Yesterday, the rice ration for our newspaper staff rose from 64,000 to 72,000 [currency units]. Thirty dan were not sold. After repeated requests, we received preferential treatment as old customers, and the rice shop only sold us twenty-three dan.

This was the market price yesterday morning; this was the market price for rice.

Rice! Rice!

Primary school tuition is 120,000 [currency units], and secondary school tuition is 200,000 [currency units].

Friends congratulated me because I have no children.

I worry for my friend because this gentleman has...

### Random Talk on Cremation by Gan Lai

"A rotten, stinking carcass, reduced to ashes in a blaze, how delightful, how clean!"

According to estimates from the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937]: one-eleventh of China's arable land is taken up by graves. This fact is a poignant irony for our country, which is suffering from economic exhaustion and food shortages. Therefore, some people have long advocated reforming China's funeral system.

Due to different customs and habits, funeral rituals vary from place to place, including: gold burial, wooden coffin burial, water burial, cremation, earth burial, dog burial, eagle burial, funerary human sacrifice, and exposure burial... of all kinds. Some are so bizarre that they are inconceivable, and some are so cruel that you cover your eyes and pinch your nose. Among them, only cremation meets the principles of "hygiene" and "economy."

Cremation existed in ancient China. Mozi's "Frugal Burial" chapter advocates cremation. Cremation was likely introduced into China with Buddhism, so the practice of cremation flourished during the Han dynasty when Buddhism was popular. However, it was always opposed by Confucians and their followers, who advocated "the body, hair, and skin are received from one's parents, and should not be harmed." This is one reason why cremation has not been widely practiced in China.

Cremation equipment is very simple: 1. A cremation furnace and fuel. Fuels are divided into gas and diesel, the latter being more cost-effective. After cremating a human body, about three pounds of "ashes" can be obtained, accounting for one-fiftieth of the body weight. These ashes can be sealed in containers for descendants to enshrine. According to calculations from the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], the average cost of cremating a human body with kerosene is only 30 cents in legal tender.

Among civilized countries, cremation has become a common funeral practice. The recently deceased British literary giant H.G. Wells also chose cremation as his final resting place. Besides saving land, being hygienic, and economical, cremation is also a way to clear accumulated human corpses.

I support cremation. In my future will, I will definitely specify "cremate me." To refine the rotten carcass in the raging flames, how delightful! How clean!

### A Little Bit of Sense by Xiao Kong

I'll tell a story to my friends:

There were two fortune-tellers. One loved to tell the truth. If your "eight characters" [of birth time] determined that you were a "petty thief," then when you "talked about your life" with him, he would honestly and bluntly say that your future was as a "gentleman on the roof beams." The other specialized in telling lies. If you talked to him about your "annual luck," he would always congratulate you on having a day to make a fortune. The former's "door was deserted," while the latter's was "crowded with customers." My conclusion is that there are too many people in the world who love to hear lies, and only those who tell lies can gain a foothold!

My friend was unconvinced and said, "Loving to hear lies" is originally a human "instinct," so why be surprised! He also insisted that I also loved to hear lies. He said:

"Take your works, for example. They are originally third-rate stuff. If people say your work is 'lousy,' you get angry. If they say your writing is beautiful, then you are happy..."

My friend's words, "make a little bit of sense!"

### A Smile by Chun Liang

One evening, a man and his wife were sitting together in the lounge. The telephone rang, and the man answered it. He replied on the phone: "Heaven knows, how would I know? Why don't you call the funeral home and ask?" Then he hung up and went back to reading his newspaper.

His wife asked, "Dear, who was calling?"

The husband said, "I have no idea. Some rude, bastard man's voice asked me if the dead ghost was out. How would I know!"

In a restaurant on Miami Beach, there is a sign posted that reads, "If you are over eighty years old and come to our restaurant with both your parents, then eat whatever you want, all for free!"

### Corpse Odor by Wu Daquan

Friend? Do you know? There is a smell like salted yellow croaker near the entrance of Pushan Villa, especially in summer nowadays.

Friend, I tell you: I have walked past two coffin depositaries – their addresses I have fortunately forgotten – and the stench of corpses filled the surrounding air, impolitely drilling into the noses of passersby and into the windows of residents. Imagine, can you stand it? Is it hygienic?

I don't understand – I don't understand many things anyway – why not burn the corpses briskly with a burst of raging fire, leaving a few clean bones, stored in clean earthenware jars? Instead, they insist on solemnly sealing them in a rectangular box and are still afraid that they will jump out of the box, nailing on a dozen large iron nails.

Friend, I'm not arguing with you. I invite you to take a stroll near the entrance of Pushan Villa. I invite you to wander around near the coffin depositary. If you don't know how to get there, I invite you to check the phone book, find two funeral homes, and then talk to me in the aisle where the coffins are placed. Now, go! Don't come back sick, with a headache or fever. I declare in advance that I am not responsible for any of this.

### Book Famine by Chong Zheng

If Shanghai had as many books as glass belts and glass handbags, there wouldn't be a book famine.

Unfortunately, no glass books have come to Shanghai. Otherwise, even illiterate young men and women would rush to buy a glass book to read.

Now, Shanghai is truly diverse. As long as you have money, anything is possible. However, the books you want to buy are often unavailable, even if you have the money.

I was once asked by a friend to buy two books: Ai Wu's revised edition of the Literary Handbook and an English weekly magazine. I went to more than a dozen bookstores on Fourth Road! Still couldn't find them. Finally, I managed to buy a copy of the Literary Handbook in a medium-sized bookstore. Why is there such a book famine? Let the people of Shanghai find the answer themselves!

However, is there really no books? No, there are books everywhere, but when you open them to read, you want to cry but can't, and you want to laugh but can't? Among the low-grade and gimmicky books, the more "intermediate" ones are books like "24 Hours to Success." Do we need these books? The answer is "No!" But the world is full of strange things, so strange that everyone is not surprised, and that is that those books are popular. But the reference books that school teachers need, the books that students want, cannot be bought.

Books, oh books! Are you afraid to come to the "glass world"? Or does the glass world not want you to bring books with a shabby aura?

### It's Not Easy Being a Father by Zi Wei

### Me in the "Dog Kennel" by Shi Pei

Because of the cramped living space, I have never been very welcoming of friends visiting. Seeing that I am wearing a silk shirt and white leather shoes in the office, and also fanning myself ostentatiously with a folding fan with painted flowers and inscriptions, in reality, my home, to be honest, is like a "dog kennel," as my wife says. It was a Sunday afternoon, and the temperature in my attic room had reached ninety-four degrees. Sweat dripped down my face and back like pearls, as if I was immersed in a fire pit. Everyone was drowsy from the heat. My wife was probably tired from being busy cooking and washing clothes in the morning, so she took our nine-month-old child and fell asleep on the bed. The eldest and second children also silently dragged out the ragged mat from behind the bed and lay down on the floor shirtless. Only I was left, although I was also desperate from the heat, I still wanted to take advantage of this only holiday to write two letters that I had to write.

But I had barely written three lines when there were two "knock! knock!" sounds on the door.

I was startled, put down my pen, and asked, "Who is it?"

"It's me. Brother ××."

Damn! My colleague, Mr. Zhang, is here. Why would this guy come looking for me at this time! I hurriedly stood up and pushed my sleeping wife awake, while apologetically shouting towards the door:

"Mr. Zhang? Sorry, please... wait a moment..."

My wife opened her eyes and jumped off the bed, anxiously saying, "What? We have a guest? Open the door slowly! How can I meet people wearing shorts!"

"Quiet, quiet"—like a thief afraid of being discovered, I repeatedly waved my hand at her, threw a Xiangyunsha cheongsam from the clothes rack to her. Turning around, I woke up my two shirtless sons who were lying on the mat on the floor.

"Quick, put on your clothes and get up, put away the mat, Dad has a guest!" I said softly.

The children were stunned for a moment, then got up from the ground and quickly rolled up the mat and stuffed it behind the bed.

My wife put on her clothes and wanted to apply powder, but I snatched the powder away.

"My dear!" I was anxious, but didn't dare to shout loudly, "Don't you see the clothes piled on the chair and bed? And those building blocks, empty bottles, broken leather shoes... it looks like a second-hand stall!"

My wife sighed, glared at me, and went to clean up. I ordered the children to quickly sweep the floor. I myself put on a silk short shirt. By the time the general mobilization was complete, my poor friend had been waiting in the darkness of the stairwell for five minutes.

Opening the door, there was a flurry of fervent apologies. Mr. Zhang kept saying it was okay, but when he sat down, I noticed that the back of his long gown was completely soaked with sweat.

"Mr. Zhang, this is the first time you've come to my humble abode, I'm so sorry for the poor hospitality. There were some minor matters just now, making you wait so long, I'm really sorry, haha..."

"Not at all, not at all!"

Mr. Zhang said modestly, fanning himself vigorously, while surveying my dilapidated attic room as if admiring a work of art. My heart was beating slightly, following Mr. Zhang's gaze around. Damn! The cuff of a pair of pajamas was sticking out from under the quilt. A sock was sticking out from under the mat. Scraps of paper and novels were scattered haphazardly on the floor behind the bed. What other way is there to remedy it? I cleared my throat and glanced at the two children who were standing there in a daze. Then the tea came.

"Please have some tea, haha, Mr. Zhang, it's hot today, take off your jacket?"

"No need, thank you."

The sleeping child suddenly started crying. My wife hurriedly bent down to coax him, patting him, but it was no use! He kept crying, and the air in the attic room became even more stuffy and irritable!

I frowned and saw that Mr. Zhang also looked embarrassed. I stood up, feeling both exasperated and ashamed!

"Mr. Zhang, why don't we go sit in the Ice Room across the street..."

"Good idea!" Mr. Zhang smiled and stood up enthusiastically.

The stairwell was dark. To show respect, I let Mr. Zhang go first. But after going down three steps, there was a "thump!" It turned out that Mr. Zhang didn't see the wood piled by the second landlord in the dark and hit his head hard. I repeatedly asked, "Are you okay?" He only said, "I'm fine, I'm fine!"

Emerging from the back door, in the scorching sun, I saw a red mark on Mr. Zhang's forehead, which was streaked with sweat. The child's crying upstairs and my wife's scolding seemed to grow louder and louder.

Special Edition for the "Miss Shanghai" Contest to Benefit North Jiangsu Refugees: Dedicated to the Brave ·Editor·

"Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.

Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God."

Matthew 5

We should salute all the working friends of the Shanghai Fundraising Committee of the North Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association!

They do not feel the fatigue of running around in the scorching sun; they do not feel the pain of encountering thorny issues and having their tongues worn out; they even disregard the ridicule and slander of some minorities, and do not even consider success or failure; "life is for the purpose of service," they bravely and fearlessly fully demonstrate this spirit, because they are pure, frank, innocent, and have a heart that loves others as themselves, how can they remain indifferent to the 3.5 million North Jiangsu compatriots who are suffering in dire straits, carrying their wives and children and fleeing to foreign lands?

Don't go too far, just go to the train station and see the group of people camping on the streets!

We should salute the ladies who are participating in this contest!

They each have their own dignity and pride. They do not covet the honorary titles of "Miss Shanghai" or "Queen," nor do they covet the golden crown and laurel wreath. Without these, they would still live the same way, and with these, it would be the same. They know that some people will say that they are fools, and they know even more that society needs fools. The results for those who stand by and make sarcastic remarks are not necessarily smart.

Have we read Ibsen's play "An Enemy of the People"? Let this space represent our cheers and blessings to these people with pure hearts mentioned above!

### Comprehensive Report on the Miss Shanghai Election: The History of the Event ·Our Newspaper Archives·

The long-awaited Miss Shanghai will be born tonight!

Shanghainese have always loved "gimmicks." Usually, it's difficult to get them to honestly take out some money to help disaster victims. For this reason, those in charge have to rack their brains and organize various novel initiatives to achieve the effect of disaster relief.

Thus, following dance-based disaster relief, the election of "Miss Shanghai" was held.

However, holding the election should not be seen as a "gimmick"! Mr. Wu Kaixian said at a symposium for the press and candidates: "This election is by no means a leisurely pursuit. I hope everyone will be merciful and relieve suffering!"

Really, gentlemen, be generous! Millions of hungry refugees in Northern Jiangsu are eagerly awaiting your "charity"!

### Preparation Process

The idea of electing "Miss Shanghai" to help disaster relief was proposed last month at the Shanghai Fundraising Committee of the North Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association. It was approved by Chairman Du and Vice Chairman Wu. At that time, it was planned to divide Miss Shanghai into four groups: (1) Socialite Group, (2) Movie Star Group, (3) Singer Group, (4) Dancer Group, with each group holding separate elections. The Socialite Group was jointly launched by the Women's Association and prominent figures from all walks of life, the Dancer Group was launched by Sun Hongyuan, Chairman of the Dance Hall Industry Association, the Movie Star Group was launched by Feng Xizui, and the Singer Group was launched by Lu Jinrong. Later, a Kunqu Opera Group was added, launched by Wang Qijun.

After deliberation, the Publicity Group of the Association immediately drafted a registration form for applicants, which included name, age, place of origin, workplace, address and phone number, height, weight, and special talents. The form was distributed by the organizers at all levels. In addition to filling out the form, applicants were required to submit a four-inch half-length photo.

Later, a "Yue Opera Group" was added, launched by Lu Jinrong and Yan Xiaofang. The definitions were also determined: one "Miss Shanghai" would be selected from the Socialite Group, and one "Queen" would be selected from each of the other groups. Election tickets were divided into three types: red tickets were worth 100,000 [currency units] each, counting as 100 votes; green tickets were worth 50,000 [currency units] each, counting as 50 votes; and yellow tickets were worth 10,000 [currency units] each, counting as 10 votes.

### Election Date

The election date was originally set for August 15th. At the second preparatory meeting, it was changed to August 20th—that is, today—and would be held at the New Celestial Forest Dance Hall, along with a garden party. Chairman Du and Vice Chairman Wu would preside in person, and Dr. Mei Lanfang would present the awards. Admission tickets were limited to 3,000.

Currently, apart from the Yue Opera Group and the Movie Star Group withdrawing from the election, there are a total of four groups: the Socialite Group, the Dancer Group, the Singer Group, and the Peking Opera Group.

The organizers were considerate to the candidates. To avoid disappointment among the ladies after losing the election, the "Miss Shanghai" title was divided into "Champion," "Runner-up," and "Third Place." The remaining three groups would each select one "Queen" and two "Runners-up." Jin Hongxiang, General Manager of Hongxiang Company, donated nine laurel wreaths and nine of the latest style coats for the coronation.

### A Statistic

There are already forty-eight candidates participating in "Miss Shanghai" and various "Queens" elections, of which about four-fifths are applying for "Miss Shanghai." According to the statistical analysis of the submitted registration forms: the oldest is 28 years old, the youngest is 17 years old, the height ranges from 5 feet to 5 feet 4 inches, and the average weight is around 100 pounds. Most of the special talents are singing, swimming, and so on.

### Twists and Turns

The preparation and launch of the election work initially faced great difficulties. Because opinions from the outside world were mixed, most ladies were unwilling to participate in the election, especially the socialites, who felt it would put them on par with dancers and singers, which would be demeaning to their status, making it even more difficult to launch the event. It wasn't until the 2nd of this month that Miss Gao Qingyi, a student at Minli Girls' School, was the first to register. Later, more and more people applied. All the female staff members of the Civil Affairs Bureau also participated, but it is regrettable that the "Movie Queen" election failed to materialize. The Yue Opera Group also withdrew due to "fear of public opinion" (?), but they are willing to donate money for disaster relief by performing charity performances.

Some old scholars are complaining: most people also think this is a "strange thing" and are deeply saddened by it. Originally, if these people who talk coldly could automatically give generously, there would be no need for any elections at all. Therefore, these ladies who apply are even more admirable!

### Joint Declaration of the Candidates

Although the joint letter of the thirty-eight candidates stated: "Our purpose is disaster relief, we hope that people from all walks of life will donate more money to help the North Jiangsu refugees. As for who is elected, it is not what we desire." However, winning "Miss Shanghai" or "Queen" is always a grand event, so the competition has been launched enthusiastically. Pulling in relatives and friends, finding acquaintances, everyone is busy and happy, all preparing to win the "throne" in the election. Among them, Wang Yunmei and Xie Jiahua of the Socialite Group are the most active, and Yan Huizhu, Tong Zhiling, and Cao Huilin of the Peking Opera Group have a tripartite power. Among the dance stars, Guan Minli, Li Zhen, etc., and among the singers, Zhang Yiwen, Han Jingqing, etc., are the most active.

This election can be said to be a "competition of money," the purpose is to donate money, the election is not based on appearance, figure, etc. as a standard, so all candidates are trying their best to sell election tickets, and private donations are also not in the minority. It is expected that the total amount will exceed 400 million [currency units].

During the election tonight, the Shanghai Fundraising Committee of the North Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association will invite more than ten people including Xu Jiyi, Qian Xinzhi, Jin Runxiang, Yang Xiaotian, Ge Jechen, Yu Zuoting, and Qin Liankui to supervise the election affairs. There will also be recreational programs, which will be exceptionally wonderful, and the voting will close at 9 pm, and the results will be announced at 11 pm.

Okay, let's see who wins tonight in the New Celestial Forest! (Picture: Han Jingqing)

### Disaster Relief First by Ping Zhai

The eight-year War of Resistance was not only the first major event in the thirty-five years since the founding of the Republic of China, but also the most heroic period in the history of the Chinese nation's struggle for freedom and independence. Countless soldiers fell one after another on the battlefield, braving the hail of bullets, bravely washing away the humiliation since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95 with their hot blood, and in exchange for a glorious victory—but behind these tens of thousands of soldiers, clenching their teeth, enduring any tragic separation for the sake of the future of the country and the nation, there were also 450 million compatriots across the country.

Victory has been won, but there are still many compatriots who are displaced and unable to return to their homes, and there are still many who are wandering in foreign lands, worse than being abandoned in ditches. The transportation lines have been destroyed a lot by the enemy during the war. With great difficulty, a little bit has been repaired, but there are those war-loving thugs who are painstakingly trying to continue the enemy's unfinished business, actively and thoroughly hindering these only railways and highways!

The enemy has just been sent back, but new disasters have begun again. Not only can the people who were originally wandering outside not return, but also new refugees are forced to leave their hometowns every day!

Moreover, "natural disasters" are becoming more rampant due to "man-made disasters." Floods, droughts, locusts, and plague occur one after another. For several months, the general public in Shanghai was threatened by the threat of tiger plague and ran around in panic, but little did they know that compared to the disasters in Henan, Northern Jiangsu, Hunan, and Guangxi, Shanghainese were truly living in paradise!

Everyone has a heart of compassion. The compatriots in Shanghai really can't stand by anymore. Strictly speaking, this disaster relief is not a charitable undertaking, but a responsibility that every Shanghainese should fulfill, a debt that should be repaid! Because, if it were not for the heroic sacrifices of these soldiers, the displacement of these righteous people, and the baptism of these lands by artillery fire for the sake of victory—we would not be able to live such a comfortable life in Shanghai. Today's enthusiastic donations are just the price that should be paid and a little bit of heart that should be given in memory of this great victory.

For the sake of disaster relief, we should do our best; for the sake of disaster relief, we should not hesitate to make any sacrifices!

Recently, in order to help the refugees in Northern Jiangsu, the Relief Committee launched the "Miss Shanghai" election campaign. In addition to selecting a "Miss Shanghai," "Queens" from several groups such as "Singers," "Dancers," "Yue Opera," "Drama," "Movie Stars," and "Peking Opera" will also be selected. Although the ladies and stars who signed up to participate in this charitable cause are quite enthusiastic, it is said that some people who never donate generously and prefer to make sarcastic remarks have suddenly criticized this matter, so that a certain famous Yue Opera singer even said something like "public opinion is fearsome." Of course, we do not know whether the behavior of this certain famous singer herself has any aspects that may cause "fearsome" "public opinion," and we are not interested in it, but if someone is criticized for participating in this charitable cause of disaster relief, we would like to know what kind of people are saying these "public opinions." Is there still that kind of ignorant and stubborn hypocrite who insists on keeping the "ladies" tightly locked in their boudoirs? Indeed, we have seen such people before. They opposed women cutting their hair, opposed co-education, and opposed men and women walking side by side on the road. But what is the situation now? Has their opposition pulled back the wheels of the times? From the perspective of fundamentally eradicating those feudal remnants, this election is also worth holding, and it may as well be held every year!

However, all the women compatriots in Shanghai seem to have reached a time when they should examine themselves. After the victory, a female senator has already accused a secretary general of the city government, and a female chief prosecutor has accused a president of the court. At the same time, in the political and vocational circles, there are very capable female compatriots who are active. This is a new atmosphere, a very good trend. The original Chinese psychology of valuing men over women, this new atmosphere should be able to clear up, the only question is whether the women's circles across the country have this awareness, whether they can all cherish this new beginning. The citizens of Shanghai twenty years ago were not necessarily more enlightened than now. However, when Ms. Guo Anci, who was excellent in character and learning, was elected as "Miss Shanghai" twenty years ago, it did not seem that any "fearsome public opinion" was heard. During this election, this point may be worth thinking about for all the young ladies in Shanghai.

### Ms. Liu Deming of the Socialite Group

### Ms. Wang Yunmei of the Socialite Group

### Ms. Pan Zhiyi of the Socialite Group

### Liu Deming, Daughter of a Lawyer

The young and beautiful Miss Liu Deming is the daughter of lawyer Liu Daokui and is currently an assistant at the Xincheng District Office. Due to the encouragement of the district chief, lawyer Wang Jian'e, she finally joined the election. Miss Liu is 19 years old, from Shanghai, and a graduate of Qixiu Girls' High School. She weighs 104 pounds, and although she is not tall, she is slender and graceful. Her eyes shine when she smiles, making her even more charming. In the past few days, Liu Deming has also been working very hard, selling nearly 20 million [currency units] worth of election tickets. She is a beautiful, intelligent, and sensible person who has also acted in several dramas, a typical Miss Shanghai.

### Imagine This Is a Sensation in New York

Imagine this is in New York City.

The motion to elect "Miss New York" has passed, and the whole city begins to stir. Newspapers let "Miss New York" take up the largest space. Radio is full of "Miss New York" news, and magazine covers are competing to publish "Miss New York" photos... everything is caught up in the whirlpool, everything is vibrant.

### Ms. Wang Yunmei: Her Favorite Hobby Is Traveling

Speaking of Miss Wang Yunmei, it is easy to associate her with the lucky Cinderella in the Western fairy tale "Glass Slippers." She picked up a pair of glass slippers, and the prince fell in love with her and married her into the palace. Wang Yunmei's past is quite turbulent and full of dramatic meaning. She has been to Qingdao and Peiping, and finally returned to Shanghai. She once worked in the Xianle Dance Palace, but only for a short time, about half a year. It is said that after the victory, she picked up her own "glass slippers," at the top floor of Seven Heaven. She once bought charity balls for 5 million [currency units] at the Qingbai vs. Donghua charity competition. Her performance in this election is said to be over 30 million [currency units]. Miss Wang is from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, 23 years old, 5 feet 4 inches tall, and weighs 109 pounds. According to her, her favorite hobby is traveling.

### Cao Huilin Became a Monk Halfway: Has Been Singing for Seven Years, Doesn't Feel Much Interest in the Election, Likes to Sit in Coffee Shops and Watch Movies as Daily Pastime by Wei Yang

I went to visit Cao Huilin backstage at the China Theater. She was putting on her costume, preparing to go on stage.

Her face was already made up, her eyebrows were thickly painted, and her two eyes were dark and moving, and lively enough. She was very slender, not quite curvaceous. When she spoke, she had the charm of a young lady. If Cao Huilin is beautiful, it belongs to the classical type of old opera.

One day, there was an article in a certain evening newspaper under the name of Cao Huilin, expressing her attitude towards participating in the Miss Shanghai election. I thought Cao Huilin could actually write articles, so I brought up this topic as an opening remark.

"I heard that Miss Cao writes very well." She seemed stunned when she heard this. A woman in her forties, probably her mother, quickly added, "She doesn't write well, please give us more advice."

The topic then turned to other things. Cao Huilin said that she was from Suzhou and learned to sing opera "halfway," and had been singing for seven years now. She spent the first two years in Suzhou, then spent five years in Nanjing, and had only come to Shanghai recently. I asked her which operas she was best at, and she turned her head and smiled, "I can't talk about being best at any opera." She said modestly, "I learned to sing Qingyi operas, but Shanghainese like to watch Zuo Gong [acting]."

Apart from singing opera, she said that her daily life was always the same. She either practiced singing at home or sat in a coffee shop, talking about operas with people from the opera troupe. In addition, she liked to watch movies, which was probably her only hobby.

Speaking of participating in the Miss Shanghai election, I asked her how many donation tickets she had sold. She said, "I don't feel much interest in the election. I'm just doing my duty. As for donation tickets, I saw that Yan Huizhu and the others took 600 tickets, so I took 600 tickets."

The gongs and drums in the front stage were getting louder and louder. Amidst her laughter, we ended this short conversation.

### Miss Pan Zhiyi, A Representative Publicly Recommended by the Shanghai Telephone Company's Labor Union

When the "Miss Shanghai" election was being promoted enthusiastically, the colleagues of Shanghai Telephone Company unanimously believed that they would not lag behind in disaster relief and rose up to respond. The Labor Union also put forward a representative, Miss Pan Zhiyi, as a "Miss Shanghai" candidate. Miss Pan is 22 years old, from Nanjing. She is 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 110 pounds. She is a top student from Xiaoming Girls' High School and has been working at the telephone company for nearly four years. When the reporter asked about her recent situation, she said: she is currently in the call center, working six and a half hours every day, and spends her weekends playing ball and swimming for entertainment. She is a self-sufficient and respected professional woman.

### Working Six and a Half Hours a Day: A Respectable Professional Woman

### Zhang Yiwen and Mai Lan

The other two candidates in the Singing Star Group are Zhang Yiwen and Mai Lan. Miss Zhang Yiwen is from Shanghai and is 21 years old. She weighs 90 pounds and is 5 feet 1 inch tall. She started singing at the Four Sisters Cafe last summer and has been there for exactly a year. According to her, she likes lively soprano songs, especially "Romana." In her spare time, she likes to read books and watch movies. Her favorite movie star is Loretta Young, the heroine of "China Forever."

### The Chinese Communists Publicly Launch War: Yan'an Actually Calls Upon the People to "Join the War"; Minister Bai Speaks of the Government Still Hoping for Peace

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] The Communist Party's Zhangjiakou radio announcer, in an excited tone on the evening of the 19th, called upon all military personnel, workers, peasants, demobilized soldiers, ethnic minorities, and everyone else in the "Liberated Areas" to join the army and the war. They also organized a "Self-Defense War Mobilization Committee" to launch a mass guerrilla war and begin a "New Heroism Movement." Late at night, this reporter visited Fan Changjiang, spokesperson for the Communist Party delegation, and asked if this kind of inflammatory broadcast indicated that the Communist Party was declaring war on the government. He said that this was an indication of entering a state of total war, but it could not be called a declaration of war.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] The Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, "Liberation Daily," published an article today urging the "mobilization of the Communist army and the people in the war zone," saying that the central government had amassed eighty-five percent of its forces in an attempt to drive the Communist army out of the North China Railway District. Since launching large-scale warfare at the beginning of last month, the National Army has made great progress in three "Liberated Areas" and has occupied the entire territory of the Hubei-Henan Liberated Area, most of the Eastern Henan Liberated Area, and part of the Jiangsu-Anhui Liberated Area. China has now erupted into a large-scale civil war not seen for decades. The Communist army should fight to save the country from collapse and to implement the sacred resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference.

[United Press, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi said that Yan'an's call for the Communist Party to mobilize in order to defeat the Kuomintang only exposed the Communist Party's actions over the past six months. However, Bai also hoped that Special Envoy Marshall could continue to mediate and perhaps obtain a peaceful solution for China. The people of China all desire peace, and eventually, it can be achieved. It would be best if it could be achieved without war, and political negotiations are the only answer to China's problems. Hitler and Mussolini have proven that force cannot succeed. Bai defended the government's sincerity, saying that Special Envoy Marshall would publish a "comparison table" proving that the government, despite being obstructed by the Communist Party, was still able to abide by the troop reorganization plan. South of the Longhai Railway, the reorganization has been completed. North of the Longhai Railway, it is impossible to reorganize due to the presence of the Communist army, but 800 generals and 160,000 officers nationwide have been reorganized into the reserves. Although the war north of the Yangtze River has spread far, the safety of the Nanjing-Shanghai area can be guaranteed, and the overall situation is largely under control. The most critical area at present is the Longhai Railway area, where the two sides have been fighting for many months. The Communist side has concentrated 100,000 troops and, although temporarily victorious, will soon be suppressed. It is estimated that the total strength of the Communist army inside the pass is about 500,000, with the rest in the Northeast. In addition, although the number of militia is large, their training and equipment are inadequate, and they are only suitable for guerrilla warfare. After reorganizing the army into divisions, the government army's strength is about three million. There is no Communist Party problem south of the Yangtze River today, only a few remaining troops engaged in harassment. Although the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communists is gradually intensifying, the government and he personally still hope to achieve peace through mediation, which can succeed as long as both sides are sincere.

### If the Communist Army Continues to Attack Datong, the Government Will Take Self-Defense Actions; Zheng Jiemin Sends a Memorandum to the Communist Side

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 19th Dispatch] The government side of the Military Mediation Department, under the name of Zheng Jiemin, sent a memorandum to the Communist side this morning, stating: "If the Communist army continues to attack Datong, the government will take the freedom of action against Chengde, Zhangjiakou, and Yan'an, to assist the self-defense of Datong." In response, the Communist side also made a statement, saying that if the memorandum did not have the premise of "continuing to attack Datong," it would also be considered that the Communist army's attack on Datong had resulted in the National Army taking the freedom of action against the above three places. According to what this reporter has learned, the memorandum was drafted on the 17th and was only delivered today. It was not convenient to publish it before. Commander-in-Chief Zuo Yi of the 12th War Zone arrived in Beiping from Guihua last night. This morning, he and Commander Sun Lianzhong of the 11th War Zone successively met with Li Zongren for long talks and had lunch together.

[United Press, Beiping, 19th Dispatch] According to news released by officials here tonight, the central government has just issued an "ultimatum" to the Communist Party, saying that unless the Communist army immediately ceases its siege of Datong, the National Army will launch a fierce offensive against one of the three major cities occupied by the Communist Party, namely Yan'an, Zhangjiakou, or Chengde. The ultimatum was delivered yesterday by Zheng Jiemin, the government representative of the Military Mediation Department, in the form of a memorandum to Ye Jianying, the Communist Party representative, with a copy to Robert, the U.S. representative.

### The Battle of Datong Becomes More Fierce; The Communist Army's Fourth General Offensive is Still Repelled; The Battle of the Central Plains Turns in Favor of the National Army

After the Second Taiyue Eighth Route Army repelled the offensive by Zhang Conglong's troops of the National Army in Hongdong City, it occupied Hongdong County on the Tongpu Railway on the 16th.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 19th Dispatch] The Military Mediation Department instructed the Rehe Chifeng Chaoyang Chengde groups to invite the highest commanders of the Kuomintang and Communist armies in Rehe to hold a joint meeting in Pingquan to carry out comprehensive mediation.

### The Democratic Socialist Party is Being Organized; Merged from the National Socialist Party and the Overseas Constitutional Democratic Party; Zhang Junmai and Others Serve as Members of the Organizing Committee

[Our Dispatch] Mr. Zhang Junmai told reporters yesterday that the National Socialist Party and the Overseas Constitutional Democratic Party have decided to merge into the Democratic Socialist Party due to their similar political positions. Zhang said that the merger was discussed as early as last November when Zhang visited the United States. At that time, preliminary consultations were held with the Overseas Constitutional Democratic Party in Montreal. On the 14th of this month, the two parties held a joint meeting in Shanghai, which ended the day before yesterday. An organizing committee was formed, and Zhang Junmai, Xu Chuanlin, Tang Dexin, Wu Xianzi, Li Daming, and others were elected as members to be responsible for preparing for the merger. However, the official establishment will be held in Shanghai within two or three months after the National Congress of the Party, when the Central Committee will also be established. Zhang said that the Democratic Socialist Party is an independent unit, and whether it will cooperate with the Democratic League in the future will be decided after formal establishment and joint discussion. As for the party's basic political program, it is said that it centers on the realization of democratic socialism. Its main purpose is to respect public opinion under the principles of planning and organization, and to adopt legislative and administrative methods to determine and implement economic, political, cultural, and other policies in stages, in order to achieve the goal of reforming society. In addition, it advocates improving the people's lives and protecting the interests of farmers and workers. In terms of diplomacy, it is impartial to the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and promotes world peace and prosperity in accordance with the United Nations Charter.

Zhang Junmai Issues Opinions on the Current Situation

The reporter then asked Mr. Zhang for his opinion on the current situation. Zhang replied: (1) The main task of the National Assembly is to draft a constitution. The constitution is the fundamental law of the country. If the constitution can be completed, then current temporary problems such as transportation and war will be easily solved. In the Political Consultative Conference, opinions were exchanged on the draft constitution, and eighty percent have reached consensus. It is extremely appropriate to complete the unfinished business as soon as possible. Therefore, he strongly agrees with the proposal of Zuo Shunsheng and Chen Qitian to convene a constitutional draft review committee. (2) The compromise plan proposed by General Marshall on June 30 has stipulated that the ratio of troops on both sides should be one to five, concentrated in defensive areas within six months, and a transportation group should be formed to implement the transportation recovery plan. The government should recognize and sign it immediately. If the army can be reorganized and transportation restored, the third party will be willing to work hard to resolve the difficulties in the Northeast. (3) Regarding the expansion of the government, if it is beneficial to domestic peace and unification, the Democratic Socialist Party is willing to participate. If it is of no benefit to domestic peace, it does not intend to join.
