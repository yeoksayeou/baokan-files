### Chongqing Students' Patriotic Parade Demands Soviet Troops Withdraw from Northeast, Territorial Sovereignty Must Not Be Violated

[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 22nd] The patriotic parade of various schools in the Shapingba-Ciqikou area of Chongqing, with the participation of 22 schools and about 20,000 people, entered Shangqing Temple at 9:00 this morning. The orderliness of the ranks and the good discipline surpassed those of the past. The whole group shouted slogans with passionate fervor, marking a new era in the development of the student movement in the wartime capital. Spectators lined the streets, deeply moved by the colorful maps that symbolized the arbitrary carving up of Chinese territory. A special feature of this parade was the unanimous participation of faculty and staff from various schools, and the slogans shouted were also full of strong patriotism. As the procession passed, the public expressed deep sympathy and responded with warm applause. The procession demonstrated in front of the Soviet Embassy and Xinhua Daily, allowing one person to hold up a paper-made red conscience in front of Xinhua Daily, shaking it and shouting while the procession continued, intending to urge the Chinese Communist Party to wake up quickly, show conscience, and love the country. The procession dispersed at Xiaoshizi at 12:30 PM.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] Students from major and minor schools in Chongqing, deeply concerned about the increasingly serious Northeast problem, eagerly hope that the Soviet Union will faithfully fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. To expand publicity, awaken the attention of compatriots across the country, and ensure the integrity of Northeast territorial sovereignty, a Chongqing Student Patriotic Movement Parade was organized. The patriotic parade was held on the 22nd. The participating schools (in order of the parade procession) include National Central University, Central University Affiliated High School, Central University Affiliated Elementary School, Sichuan Education Institute, Central Industrial College, Central Industrial College Branch, National Art College, Shuren High School, Shudu High School, Municipal High School, Chongqing Women's School, Chongqing University, Oriental Language School, Xiangya Medical College, Ordnance School, Dagong Vocational School, Zhonghua Vocational School, Private Xinzhong High School, Nankai High School, Nankai Institute of Economics, National Papermaking and Printing College, Zhongzheng School, Rotary School, National Pharmaceutical College, National Commercial Vocational School, National Social Education College, Jiaotong University, Chongqing University of Science, Central Political School, and Central Cadre School, etc. The Central University Professors' Association, Teaching Assistants' Association, Chongqing University Professors' Association, Teaching Assistants' Association, and professors, staff, and workers from various schools also enthusiastically participated. The parade procession included more than 20,000 people. The main group assembled and formed ranks at Xiaolongkan, Shapingba, at around 8:00 AM this morning and set off to enter the city at 5:00 AM, shouting slogans along the way and distributing five types of declarations.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] At the first light of dawn, the reporter waited by Hualongqiao, hoping to be among the first to witness this grand and enthusiastic parade by students from various schools in the wartime capital since the "December 9th" Movement parade after the victory of the War of Resistance. A team of four led the way carrying a large sign that read "Chongqing City Schools Student Patriotic Movement Parade." Students from various schools followed in order, holding up various large and small flags, banners, pictures, maps, and a portrait of martyr Zhang Xinfu. Students from the conference's disciplinary and hygiene groups rode bicycles and cars to patrol and take care of the procession. The broadcasting vehicle set up by the publicity group reported news along the way. Faculty and students from various schools were in high spirits, shouting slogans and singing songs such as "March of the Volunteers" and "Sacrifice Has Reached the Last Moment" in a tragic and passionate tone. Among them, phrases such as "Save Northeast Compatriots," "Defend Northeast with Iron and Blood," "Soviet Troops Must Withdraw from Northeast Immediately," and "Xinjiang is Xinjiang of the Republic of China," and "The Chinese Communist Party Should Love the Motherland" were the most thought-provoking. Spectators on the side of the road responded with warm applause and shouted slogans along with them. Some even set off firecrackers, indicating that this parade had aroused patriotic resonance among millions of citizens in the wartime capital. Elementary school students from the Central University Affiliated Elementary School, although still young, also participated vigorously, complementing the white-haired old professors from various schools, which was very touching. The main procession marched for about an hour, passing through Niujiaotuo, Shangqing Temple, Zhong San Road, Zhong Er Road, Zhong Yi Road, circling the Spirit Fortress, and turning to Linsen Road South District. The road order was orderly. They rested in the South District Park and had lunch. At around 3:00 PM, they passed through Lianglukou and Shangqing Temple and returned to school along the original route.

### Student Parade Releases "A Letter to the People of the World," Calling for Upholding Justice and Ceasing Aggression

[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 22nd] The Student Patriotic Movement Parade released a "Letter to the People of the World," stating: "We are young people, with patriotic fervor, pure conscience, and courageous spirit. We vow to fight to the end for the independence and integrity of the Republic of China." It continued: "The War of Resistance has been won, but a thick shadow has fallen on our hearts. In the days before Japan surrendered, the Soviet Union joined the Pacific War. Of course, we welcome our allies' active participation. Soon after Japan surrendered, Soviet troops immediately entered the Northeast, assuming responsibility for accepting surrender and taking over the Northeast. We are deeply grateful. The central state relations have become more cordial, and the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was signed. The annex to this treaty stipulates that Soviet troops would complete their withdrawal from the Northeast within three months after Japan signed the surrender. However, in fact, the Soviet troops' mission has long been completed, and the troops have been delayed for more than two months, not only showing no intention of withdrawing but also showing signs of long-term occupation. At the same time, they are doing everything possible to hinder our country's takeover work. China's troops originally intended to land in Dalian to take over the Northeast, but the Soviet side did not allow it. They then changed to Yingkou, and the Soviet side agreed, but then there was another change. Then, it was agreed to airlift troops to Changchun, but the Soviet side imposed various restrictions on the number and performance of the aircraft. On the one hand, they transported away all the industrial equipment in the Northeast, making it impossible for China to take over, and even transported away cattle, sheep, and food, making it impossible for the people to cultivate in the spring and making it difficult for the people to survive. Recently, the engineers sent by China to take over the Fushun coal mine were killed under the protection of the Soviet army. Whose fault is this? Whose responsibility is this? On the other hand, the Soviet side is also cultivating local armed forces in the Northeast, establishing a special regime, and brewing the so-called People's Republic of East Mongolia. From this fact, we can know their intention and intention. They are occupying land, hoping to continue to occupy it and not withdraw. They are creating a regime, attempting to divide China. People of the world, please open your eyes and see whether the Soviet Union's actions towards China are legal or the actions of an aggressor. We fought bitterly for eight years for the country, and the result is still a broken territory and unequal treatment. We have just defeated one enemy, and another stronger enemy has come to us, extending its claws. We love peace. People of the world who uphold justice, we sincerely appeal to you to give us assistance and jointly stop the aggressor. Our demands are: (1) The Soviet Union should faithfully implement the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship; (2) Firmly reject any new demands from the Soviet Union outside the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship; (3) The Soviet army's mission has been completed, and it should immediately withdraw from the Northeast; (4) The Soviet Union should return all materials transported from the Northeast."

### Appeal to Compatriots Across the Country

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] The Chongqing Student Patriotic Movement Parade released "A Letter to Compatriots Across the Country," stating: "Today, our parade demonstration mainly aims to declare the dignity of our national sovereignty and safeguard the integrity of our national territory. To put it bluntly, we want to save our country and save our Cambodia North. The Northeast was originally our beautiful country, but today it has become a slaughterhouse at the mercy of others. The main reason is that the Soviet Union is unwilling to fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance because, according to the treaty, the Soviet troops in the Northeast have a 'maximum of three months to complete the withdrawal period,' and according to the treaty, the Northeast should be taken over by our government. Today, six months and eight days have passed since the date of signing this treaty, and the Soviet army has not yet withdrawn. The Northeast is our lifeline. We can establish a strong and prosperous modern country, relying on the Northeast. We fought against Japan for eight years and suffered all the disasters in the world. Isn't it just because of the Northeast? Today, we have won the War of Resistance, and some people want to ruin our Northeast, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang. Can we just let it go? Absolutely not."

### President Chiang Congratulates Soviet Red Army Day by Telegram

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] The 23rd is the 28th anniversary of the Soviet Red Army Day. President Chiang has sent a telegram to Marshal Stalin to express his congratulations.

### Xinhua Daily Smashed, Perpetrators Detained by Police for Investigation

[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 22nd] Today, when patriotic students held a parade to show their patriotism, a group of people put up slogans and chanted slogans outside the business department of the Xinhua Daily, which is run by the Communist Party. At that time, someone upstairs threw small objects such as teacups and phlegm containers at the crowd, which aroused public anger, and they rushed in and smashed the newspaper. Afterwards, several perpetrators were arrested, and the police authorities are currently investigating. In addition, the Democratic Newspaper, run by the Democratic League, was questioned by students today due to the publication of articles insulting the student movement some days ago, resulting in considerable losses. In recent days, the students in the wartime capital have been passionate about the Northeast issue, and there are obvious signs of spreading across the country. The general public is becoming increasingly impatient with the Communist Party's knowledge of only party and international affairs and not knowing about the country and nation, as well as the Xinhua Daily's failure to mention a word about the Soviet Union's withdrawal and its empty talk about democracy, while at the same time exaggerating the events at Jiaochangkou. Today, during the parade, the crowd shouted slogans such as "The CCP should show its conscience" and "The CCP should love the motherland," and demanded that the government adhere to a solemn position.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] At around 1:00 PM on the 22nd, the business department of Xinhua Daily on Minsheng Road was smashed. The details are as follows: When the Shapingba students' parade passed by the business department of the newspaper at around 10:30 AM to 11:00 AM, the students shouted slogans and posted slogans and maps on the glass windows and walls on both sides of the department. The road was extremely narrow and in the center of the city, the crowd was crowded, and the emotions were extremely excited. The student parade was orderly, and the conference disciplinary team maintained order at the entrance of the newspaper's business department. Twenty minutes after the student parade passed, the spectators were still standing nearby, watching the slogans without dispersing. Suddenly, someone tore up a few slogans, and the crowd was incited to anger and stepped forward to stop them. At that time, a public bus passed by, and the passengers in the bus shouted loudly, and the crowd rushed into the Xinhua Daily business department. The police stepped forward to stop them, and the crowd shouted, "Whoever protects the Xinhua Daily is a traitor," broke the door and windows, and carried out a massive destruction, throwing the books and newspapers in the house into the street. The crowd in the street applauded and shouted. Yang Liyuan, director of the Xinhua Daily business department, Xu Junman, director of the library class, and employees Guan Youmin and Pan Peixin, police chief Zhang Desheng, Xie Yunxiang, and policeman Tang Xiutai came forward to stop them and were beaten. Tang, the director of the police bureau, and Zhao, the director of the fourth branch, rushed to the scene with their teams after hearing the news, but the crowd gathered on the street, and the road was blocked. The police bravely rushed in and arrested the perpetrators. Police chiefs Zhao Bingxuan and Niu Jinyu, and policemen Yu Jun and five others were injured. Diao Zilong, Yin Wulin, Sun Shaoyi, Ding Youzhen, Shi Yaojiang, Hu Yingping, Pan Xingcheng, Yu Shuikuan, and Huang Yunbin were arrested on the spot. The crowd gathered and demanded their release. The security team forcibly escorted them to the fourth branch, and the crowd continued to clamor behind them. It was not until 3:00 PM that they gradually dispersed. According to Diao Zilong and others, they confessed that they were moved by the students' patriotic parade and participated in the destruction out of righteous indignation. Director Tang believed that the suspects were responsible for disrupting order and committing criminal offenses of damage and injury, and ordered them to be detained and sent to the court for investigation and prosecution. The injured were sent to the Municipal Hospital for treatment by the police bureau.

[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] Well-informed sources claim: The terms of the new Sino-French agreement, in addition to France's announcement of the renunciation of all extraterritorial rights in China, will also open up part of the Haiphong port as a free port for China. The contents of the agreement announced by French Colonial Minister Moutet on Wednesday are as follows: (1) France announced the renunciation of all extraterritorial rights in China; (2) France agreed to open up part of the Haiphong port as a free port for China; (3) France will sell the section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway within China to China; (4) France will allow full improvement of the status of Chinese people in Vietnam; (5) China will waive the demand for occupation fees for Chinese troops stationed in northern Vietnam. Well-informed sources also stated that the French authorities are in contact with the leaders of the Vietnamese national movement. Darien, the French High Commissioner in Vietnam, was ordered to negotiate with the Vietnamese leaders after returning to Vietnam to prepare for the transfer of internal administrative power to the Vietnamese under conditions that do not affect France's material, strategic, and cultural interests.

### Chiang Ching-kuo Goes to Soviet Union for the Third Time; U.S. Statement on the Yalta Agreement and Sino-Soviet Treaty: Soviet Union Not Granted Priority

[Chongqing, United Press, 22nd] Chiang Ching-kuo, Special Diplomatic Envoy for the Northeast, has gone to Moscow for the third time to discuss the issue of the Northeast.

[Peiping, United Press, 22nd] The "Yishih Pao" newspaper here reports that Red Army troops in Harbin and other places are fully equipped and ready to move elsewhere. Very few officers and soldiers are allowed to leave their barracks. The newspaper believes that all signs indicate a major development is imminent. The newspaper continues: About 200 Soviet troops are currently undergoing training for a certain "new mission." It also states that a certain railway in the Northeast has been dismantled and transported to the Soviet Union, and an important electrical plant has been moved to Outer Mongolia.

[Washington, United Press, 22nd] According to the U.S. State Department's announcement to United Press reporters yesterday: There are no clauses in the Yalta Agreement or the Sino-Soviet Treaty that allow the Soviet Union to obtain priority compensation or Japanese assets in the Northeast.

The day before the takeover, those Communist troops moved elsewhere again.

### The Devastation of Shenyang: The Former Industrial Area Leadership Turns to Rubble; Nine Foreign Reporters Now Free to Move Around

[Changchun, this newspaper, 21st] In recent days, children in Shenyang have begun to welcome the nine foreign reporters appearing on the streets with cheers, just as people in Changchun cheered for the Allies in the Gao Market area on Sima Road. Liang and the other nine visited Mayor Dong Wenqi for the first time today and revisited Director Peng Bisheng. They will visit the Tiexi Industrial Zone on the 22nd and will be guests at Director Peng's banquet at noon.

[Shenyang, United Press, 22nd] Shenyang, the largest city in the Northeast, with a population of nearly two million, once one of the largest industrial centers in the East, is now devastated, resembling the aftermath of an earthquake. Garbage and filth fill the streets, and broken walls and tiles are everywhere. Dilapidated cars, broken machinery, shattered tombstones, and smokeless chimneys serve as monuments to the demise of industry. Commercial activity is extremely depressed, only about one-tenth of what it used to be. At key locations in the city, Chinese police occupy fortified positions behind sandbags and barbed wire. Gunshots and explosions occur intermittently, presenting a scene of unease everywhere. The streets and alleys are plastered with slogans in Chinese and Russian, congratulating the Sino-Soviet alliance and understanding. However, the Soviet troops have actually occupied the main square of the city, Central Square, while the Chinese mostly reside in the western part of the city. A huge portrait of Stalin is hung on the square's buildings. On the Chinese side, shops are mostly decorated with portraits of Chairman Chiang.

[Shenyang, United Press, 22nd] The number of Shenyang residents who have been robbed is very high. Soviet Commander Stankevich even had his watch stolen while bathing in a major hotel.

[Another dispatch] After being confined to their residences for 54 hours due to the uncertainty of what the Soviet regime had determined as their fate, United Press reporter Davis and eight other British and American reporters were finally granted liberty today. They were now permitted by the Soviet authorities to explore this former location of Sino-Japanese aggression fourteen years prior, since the Shenyang Incident. For six months east, there have been many rumors coming from this warlord stronghold, such as rape, looting, kidnapping, and arson; its sinister situation not unlike the era of Genghis Khan. The reporter was planning on investigating and verifying this theory; to his shock, the Chinese and Soviet officials prevented him from doing so, until today. This was when a strapping, 46-year old, Soviet Major-General Stankevich announced: "Gentlemen, you are now free to move about Jiayuan, without any escort." The United Nations reporter's entrance in the northeast metropolis, occupied by the Soviet regime following the end of the war, represents the beginning. Our first impression is that two million inhabitants are suffering a sharp rise in the price of goods. Today, all foods have quadrupled in price, compared to six weeks prior. According to Soviet sources, 85% of the local factories were established for Japanese military needs. During the time, they are all closed. Between December of last year, and January of this year, typhus spread rapidly, infecting three thousand; the conditions were brought under control after many Red Army medical staff dispersed to offer protection. There are 30,000 prostitutes wandering the streets and frequenting the dance halls and tea houses. These are civic problems that Mayor Dong Wenqi and Police Chief Dai Hongdao have trouble dealing with. Therefore, they need to deliberate solutions with the Soviet Commander Stankevich often. Guarding the city are 6-7,000 of Stankevich's troops, belonging to Marshal Malinovsky's Second Ukrainian Long-Battle Soldiers. Between 10-20,000 National Army troops are stationed in the west industrial district, awaiting orders. These National Army troops are prohibited from moving about the city freely, without the express permission of the Northeast Security Forward Command. The Forward Command is only an arrow-shot away from the Red Army Command in the central circle. The circle has a memorial commemorating the Japanese victory during the Russo-Japanese War. Today, the surrounding buildings are covered with red flags, and the Red Army Command entrance has an enormous image of Stalin. There are no Japanese soldiers to be seen in the city, which is very different than the situation in North China. The original 60,000 Japanese troops stationed in Shenyang were all disarmed before the Soviet troops arrived by plane to attack on August 19th of last year. However, the Soviet authorities are unwilling to specify where these 60,000 Japanese troops are now. According to local rumors, none of them have been sent back to their home country. The strong and capable ones have all been sent to Siberia or the Soviet mainland to work in mines and build roads. As for where the Chinese Communist troops are, opinions vary, but it is generally agreed that traces of them can be found 30-50 kilometers outside the city. Chinese sources say that they are implementing a food blockade on the city. According to Stankevich, he met with the commander of the Eighth Route Army in December of last year, but because he failed to present credentials from the central government, he was asked to lead his troops out of the city. After staying for one or two days, 800 to 1,000 Communist troops left. All puppet troops were disarmed by the Soviet troops in July of last year.

### Truman Declares to Reporters: U.S. is Vigilantly Prepared to Ensure Military Secrets

Washington is Quite Shocked by the Soviet Union's Statement

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] President Truman told reporters yesterday: "Measures to protect atomic energy and other secrets remain extremely complete. These measures were already very complete when I first learned of the leakage of classified information in Canada."

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] President Truman declared at a press conference today: "The United States is sufficiently prepared to ensure the nation's military secrets. This has been the case in the past, and it will be in the future." At the same time, Secretary of State Byrnes reiterated his previous statement that the secrets of manufacturing the atomic bomb remain completely safeguarded by the United States. The Senate Atomic Energy Committee held a closed meeting today, listening to confidential reports from the chief of the espionage division of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, McKinnon, and the director of atomic bomb production, Major General Groves.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Washington feels unusually shocked by the Soviet government's statement the day before regarding the Canadian leak of classified information. The Soviet Union's admission that it obtained information about radar and atomic energy has raised concerns about the Canadian Army's current "Cow Exercise" in the northern region of the country, which will test the deployment of land and air forces. New radar inventions will be tested in this exercise.

[United Press, Ottawa, 22nd] A Canadian Foreign Ministry official revealed that the Canadian government received a note from the Soviet Union on Thursday, criticizing the Canadian government's stance on the Soviet spy network case. The Cabinet will meet today to discuss this note.

[United Press, Ottawa, 21st] The Associated Press learned today that certain information was "leaked" to Soviet agents when the Canadian government exchanged information with another unspecified country. A reliable government source said that the activities of Soviet spies in Canada reached an "alarming level" in September of last year.

[United Press, Moscow, 20th] (Delayed) The Soviet Union has not yet issued its final opinion on the espionage case announced by Canada. Future developments will depend on the Canadian government's response.

### Before the Atomic Bomb Test: Residents of the Marshall Islands Evacuated; Cattle and Sheep Will Be Used Instead of Live People During the Test

[United Press, Kwajalein, Marshall Islands, 21st] The U.S. Navy is preparing to solve the mystery of future tactics: the atomic bomb's impact on naval power. Residents of the Marshall Islands are preparing to evacuate by naval ship next month to Kili Island, 135 miles to the east. Residents of Eniwetok and Bikini atolls will also be evacuated to avoid the radioactive particles in case they are affected by the downwind wave.

[Another dispatch] Vice Admiral Wyatt, commander of the Kwajalein base, is at the forefront of the atomic bomb test, presiding over the preliminary arrangements. When concerned friends asked if the atomic bomb explosion might cause a tsunami and the entire island would be swept away by the tide, Wyatt replied: "What's there to fear? We are in the center of the greatest experiment of our lives, enjoying the benefits of the experiment, truly attending a grand event."

[Washington dispatch] At the atomic bomb experiment near the Bikini Atoll in May, the joint Army and Navy commander of the Mobile Task Force, Vice Admiral Blandy, announced today: "Cattle and sheep will be tied to the target ships to replace live people." Scientists and military experts can learn from this the biological effects of heat, light, and radiation. Various physical measurements can be made on the animals, making it easy to accurately predict the reaction of the human body: death, serious injury, or minor injury. Mechanical methods were previously used to test the physical and biological effects, but it was felt that they were not comprehensive enough, so it was decided to use animals instead.

[Another dispatch] While preparing to test the power of the atomic bomb on warships, the United States will also test the tolerance of warships and aircraft to the cold near the Arctic Circle. Foreign reporters are prohibited from attending the test.

### Using Atomic Bombs to Blast the Southern Ocean: Unearthing Treasures Under Thick Ice Layers

[United Press, New York, 21st] Rickenbacker, Chairman of Eastern Airlines, suggested to the Army and Navy authorities that atomic bombs be used to blast open the "South Polar Ice Box" in order to unearth minerals, coal, and oil that may be hidden under the thick ice layers there. He believes that this plan is within the realm of possibility and can at least determine "how much" valuable minerals such as gold, copper, and iron are buried in the South Polar region.

### Britain Suggested to the Soviet Union: Extending the Treaty of Friendship; Bevin States the International Situation in the House of Commons

[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st] During a debate in the British House of Commons today, former Foreign Secretary Eden gave a speech, saying in part: "I believe that the Soviet Union sincerely hopes to cooperate with Britain and the United States, and hopes that the United Nations organization will play a role. But while the Soviet Union wants the other two major powers to cooperate, it apparently wants other countries to comply with its terms, which is difficult to achieve and will sooner or later lead us into difficulties. If the Soviet government insists on going its own way, disregarding the will of its allies, then the allied nations will never comply."

[United Press, London, 22nd] British Foreign Secretary Bevin, who recently denounced the Soviet Union's accusations against Britain as lies in the United Nations Security Council, declared in the House of Commons today: "In December of last year, I informed Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in Moscow that if he wanted to extend the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship to 50 years (originally 20 years), he could advise the British government to accept it. Rumors that Britain is gradually moving towards war with the Soviet Union are unfounded. What objectives would we be fighting for? Some people say that Britain and the United States are united against the Soviet Union. In fact, Britain and the United States can openly and honestly put all issues on the table and discuss them together. We ask the Soviet Union to do the same as the British government and the U.S. State Department do: discuss and exchange opinions. Britain is quite uneasy about the state of 'nerve warfare' between the Soviet Union and Turkey, but does not want Turkey to become a vassal state. The Soviet-Turkish Treaty of Friendship expired last year, and we hope that it can be continued. If there are any modifications to the Montreux Convention regarding the Dardanelles Strait, Britain very much hopes that the international nature of the strait can be maintained."

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Foreign Secretary Bevin, at the conclusion of the foreign policy debate in the House of Commons yesterday, advocated that Germany's Ruhr region be placed under international joint management, and said that he had consulted very closely with France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, and that those countries would soon consult with the Soviet Union and the United States.

### Conflict Between Left and Right Factions in the Iranian Parliament: Mutual Accusations of Theft Lead to Chaos

[Reuters, Tehran, 22nd] During a meeting of the Iranian Parliament yesterday, when Deputy Esfandiari claimed that he had received a telegram stating that the left-wing Tudeh Party (Labor Party) in the northern Iranian province of Mazandaran was forcing farmers, factory owners, and car owners to donate large sums of money, engaging in extortion to the extreme, and that the Tudeh Party clearly had other goals besides those it announced, left-wing deputies rose up to condemn the right-wing deputies, who were not to be outdone, and mutual accusations of theft were made. Even journalists joined in the mutual recriminations, and chaos ensued. Newspapers also reported that there were conflicts between the Democratic Party and patriots in Zanjan, northern Iran, resulting in 35 deaths on the Democratic Party's side.

### Demanding the Withdrawal of British Troops: Large-Scale Demonstrations by Egyptian Crowds; Machine Guns Roar, Cairo Becomes a Battlefield; Result: 17 Dead, 300 Wounded

### Indian Sailors' "Mutiny" Worsens; British Vow to Use Force to Quell the Unrest; Karachi Indian Troops Already Surrendered

[United Press, Bombay, 21st] Indian naval striking sailors engaged in battle with British troops. Vice Admiral Godfrey today declared a state of "open mutiny" exists and stated that he would use all his power to quell the rebellion. The fighting broke out at the Kaser military camp, where Indian sailors had been on hunger strike earlier this week, demonstrating. Because they were prohibited from leaving the camp, the sailors attempted to break out, and British troops opened fire to stop them. The sailors retaliated, leading to a confrontational situation. Godfrey has sent an officer with a truce flag to the camp to deliver a warning letter, stating, "If you consider the superior forces now in the hands of the government, and that the government is willing to use them to the fullest extent, even if it means destroying your glorious navy."

[Reuters, London, 12th] Prime Minister Attlee stated in the House of Commons today that the Royal Indian Navy "rebels" have been told that only unconditional surrender will be accepted.

### Plan Formulated Based on Directives; Japan to Purge Militaristic Elements; Hundreds More to be Dismissed; Japanese Liberal Party Launches Anti-Communist Movement

[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] Japanese sources announced today that the Japanese government will announce within a few days another interpretation of MacArthur's directive of January 4th, dismissing hundreds of military leaders and extreme nationalists from their positions and prohibiting them from engaging in political activities. The government has recently drafted a plan to purge civil servants and journalists who engaged in propaganda activities for the military during the war. This plan will soon be approved by the Privy Council. MacArthur's order stipulates that all political parties that were allied with totalitarian factions during the war must be deprived of their qualifications, and the Japanese government has previously issued an interpretation of this point. The new ban to be implemented will affect all members of the Military Council, as well as those who participated in meetings, including former Ministers of the Army and Navy, and officials above the level of bureau chief in the East Asia Board, the Greater East Asia Ministry, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Information Bureau, as well as senior personnel in the Japan Broadcasting Corporation and the Domei News Agency.

[Remodeling Daily, Tokyo, 22nd] The president of the Japanese Liberal Party, Hatoyama, held a general affairs meeting yesterday to discuss strategies for establishing a stable force in the political arena.

One woman said that there must be debate in the family to develop political ideas, which made others laugh. Another woman said that politics seemed too bureaucratic in the past, only suitable for political and financial cliques, and not beneficial to women. We should eliminate this kind of politics, and the others echoed, "Yes, yes." According to the geisha, it has been decided to improve the level of geishas in her electoral district. Another woman replied that men's conduct may be stimulated and improved as a result.

China Farmers Bank manages huge agricultural loan

To revitalize sericulture and rescue the rural economy, the China Farmers Bank has launched a huge agricultural loan program. A total of 12 counties in Jiangsu Province, including Jiangning, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, and Jiangyin, will receive loans totaling 100 million yuan. Wuxi and other counties are included in the ordinary agricultural loans, with a total loan amount of 800 million yuan. Yao Gongzhen, the director of the agricultural loan section of the bank's Zhenjiang branch, has visited Wuxi several times to investigate sericulture. It has been determined that the loan amount for this county will be 40 million yuan, and a agricultural loan meeting will be held at the county government at 9 AM on the 27th of this month, convening representatives from various seed-producing farms and silk factories to discuss loan methods.

The case of the major robbery in the county was solved quickly. The home of Qin Zhuxiang, a resident of No. 21 and a half Dacheng Lane in the city, was suddenly robbed at gunpoint by five bandits at around 9 PM on the 14th of this month. Gold, jade, jadeite, antiques, legal tender, clothing, and other items worth more than 30 million yuan were taken. This was a rare major robbery in the urban area. Fortunately, the county government and political police swiftly investigated and solved the case, capturing the three principal offenders, Xu Bingquan, Chen Hongchang, and Wu Zhiguang, one after another. They were escorted to the county government. After two interrogations by Shen Shizeng, a military law trial officer, Xu and Chen confessed to armed robbery and admitted to dividing and spending the loot. Wu denied everything. They were ordered to be shackled and imprisoned, awaiting review and transfer to the First Pacification Area Headquarters for military law punishment.

### New Clarification of Wireless Radio; Controlling Aircraft and Ships; Accurately Surveying Terrain

[Reuters, New York, 22nd] The wireless radio navigation system that utilizes the reflection of radio waves to determine position, known as "LORAN," will soon be used to control aircraft and surface vessels, and its accuracy is unprecedented. This machine can also be used to survey terrain with exceptional accuracy, so better maps may soon be available. Details of this new invention were recently explained by Pierce of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Wireless Radio Laboratory at the first "joint" meeting held by wireless radio scientists in New York and London via international wireless telephone. Pierce predicts that the "LORAN" wireless radio can serve as an automatic pilot. Once installed in aircraft and surface vessels, it can "deliver" them to a predetermined location. At the same time, "LORAN" will plot the advance route of the aircraft and ships, so operators can always know the position of the aircraft and ships. Dr. Goldmark of Columbia Broadcasting Company reported another invention, which is the use of ultra-high frequency waves for color wireless radio transmission. It is said that using 490 kilocycles for transmission eliminates problems such as blurring. American wireless radio scientists participated in this meeting at the Astor Hotel in the center of Manhattan, listening to Dr. Dunsheath, the President of the British Institution of Electrical Engineers, predict the future development of electronics, after which both parties discussed via wireless communication across the Atlantic Ocean.

### Yan Xishan Searches for a Needle in the Taiyuan Ocean; Talks Freely with Our Reporter About the Military and Political Situation

— Beigu Special Correspondent Zhang Jianmei

On the second day after the reporter arrived in Taiyuan (the 12th), I went straight to the Commander's Office to pay my respects to Commander Yan Baichuan, who had been in charge of Shanxi for 35 years, and was received. Commander Yan is 64 years old this year, and more than two-thirds of his beard and hair are white. However, he is still sharp-eared and clear-eyed, no less than in his younger days.

Grass Yellow General's Uniform Stained with Oil

Since Commander Yan returned to Taiyuan, he has continued to wear the same uniform in the most luxurious reception hall of the entire province as he did during the days in the anti-Japanese base in western Shanxi. The grass yellow general's uniform is stained with oil. The gold shoulder badges of the three-star general are worn and damaged from long use. He wears Chinese-style long cloth cotton shoes.

On this day, Commander Yan ordered the reporter to sit close to him, and with a warm and enthusiastic demeanor, he immediately spoke freely about his ideological development and the current problems for as long as two hours. At 6 PM on the evening of the 13th, Commander Yan again hosted a banquet at the North Official Hall of the Commander's Office, inviting more than a dozen colleagues from the news media to attend. During the banquet, Commander Yan expressed his views on freedom of the press. For the sake of prudence, in addition to providing detailed verbal answers to the twelve questions raised by the reporter, Commander Yan also provided written answers. The important points of the written questions and answers are excerpted below:

Executive Headquarters Order No. 2; Disputes Unresolved

(1) What are the current areas of Shanxi controlled by the National Army? What are the areas controlled by the Communist Army? Where are the conflict points?

Yan replied: There are a total of 106 counties in this province, and the National Army controls 67 counties. Among them, the four county seats of Yijing, Fushan, Boyuan, and Zuoquan were occupied by the Communist Army after 12 PM on the 13th of January. The current conflict areas are in Qin County, Wenshui, Wenxi, Zhongyang, and other county towns. The current disputes are no less than those involved in implementing Executive Headquarters Order No. 2. The Taiyuan Executive Team recently inquired about our opinions, and we replied that we would implement it strictly without violating or discounting it. If the order can be implemented, there will be no disputes. Currently, along the Eastern Qin line, the Communist Army is destroying and attacking every day. According to reports, the Communist Army is mobilizing strategic troops from various places, concentrating their forces to attack and destroy. Among them are also Japanese troops.

Jin Intends to Formulate Implementation Plan; Integrate Soldiers and Farmers

(2) After the victory and return to Shanxi, what modifications have been made to the various policies of the Jinxi era?

Commander Yan replied: In commerce, the controlled methods have been abolished, and people are free to trade. In prices, the evaluation method has been abolished, and prices are freely negotiated by both parties. The four-hour daily living labor of cadres, soldiers, and soldiers of various troops and agencies has been abolished. Each county government has established a cooperative guidance office to guide the people in each village to prepare for the establishment of production and sales cooperatives.

(3) What are the plans for the administration and construction of Shanxi in the future? Commander Yan replied: After returning to the province, we are troubled by life, with no food and no funds, and the cadres and soldiers all feel the pain of life. The people are in a state of difficulty and turmoil rarely seen in history due to the disorder of order and the severance of transportation. Therefore, the key to governance lies in restoring order, reorganizing troops, adjusting food, and stabilizing people's lives. In the future, we will plan to build water conservancy ourselves. We have agreed with the Water Conservancy Committee to integrate soldiers and farmers. Five thousand national defense workers will build water conservancy projects. Another five thousand people will build walled railway tracks. Another 100,000 people will handle important national defense industries and other construction matters.

(4) The Political Consultative Conference has a new view on the status of the provinces. Does the commissioned official have any opinions on this? Should the provinces and districts be reduced? How should the Shanxi provinces and districts be reorganized?

The answer of the national fearful official is as follows: The Consultative Conference adopts a system of equal power between the central government and local governments, which is the implementation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy. As for the latter two questions, I am still considering them and cannot answer them. I am very sorry!

(5) There are detailed answers regarding the management of enemy expatriates and enemy prisoners, and earnestly addressing the Han traitors in the province, and they are actively underway. In addition, Commander Yan also raised issues such as strengthening the work of the National Revolutionary Comrades Association, hoping that the future revival can be promoted in some way.

### When Will the Golden Age of the Industrial World Return? Depression Envelops Kunming

…Compiled by Our Newspaper Translation Office…

The golden age of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province during the war, has passed. Kunming was once longed for and dreamed of by gold diggers, smugglers, and speculators as the Golden City of China, but after Japan surrendered, like a wartime nouveau riche, it plunged into the shackles of depression.

Adventurers and gold diggers are all musing with great emotion: "Where are the beautiful scenery of yesteryear?" People at that time, by doing speculation, buying and selling US dollar tickets, sleeping soundly, could become rich overnight, which was often possible.

These "good old days" did not seem so "good" to the average person. After more than eight years, the war finally ended, and they had been waiting impatiently. However, what completely disappointed them was that their "nightmare" did not disappear with the end of the war. The arrival of peace did not bring them an easy life and the bright opportunity to pursue happiness and happiness in the peaceful era they had been looking forward to. On the contrary, the difficulties of life, even if they did not increase, were at least the same as during the war. We have a saying: "Jump out of the frying pan and jump into the fire." This situation is very similar.

### Commercial Factories Suffer the Most Profoundly

After the Japanese devils surrendered, a sharp economic depression occurred in Kunming. The local industrial world was greatly affected. After Japan's surrender, the plummeting prices of daily necessities and the shrinking market demand were equivalent to stabbing several knives into the chest of Kunming's industry. Many factories could not withstand these storms and closed their doors. According to statistics published by the Yunnan Branch of the China Enterprise Association in November 1945, only 40 of the 77 factories in Kunming were still operating, and the rest were either bankrupt or suspended. These figures, when analyzed, are very interesting, because the owners, types, and nature of the various factories are all different. Among these 77 factories, 13 are owned by the central government and 15 are privately owned. The hardest hit were the privately run factories. The table below can be used for comparison:

Factory Nature | Total Number of Factories | Number of Bankruptcies | Percentage

---|---|---|---
State-owned | 13 | 5 | 39%
Provincially owned | 19 | 6 | 32%
Commercial | 45 | 26 | 58%

The table above reveals the situation completely and does not require any explanation. These are still the comparison figures for November 1945. Two months have passed, and things have become worse and worse. According to Dr. Xu, president of the Yunnan Branch of the China Enterprise Association, it is estimated that 90% of the factories in Kunming have gone bankrupt.

### Most of the State-Owned Factories Have Been Closed

Let's take a closer look at the situation of state-owned factories. During the War of Resistance, the Resources Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs established many factories in Kunming. Among them, the most important are: Central Electrical Equipment Factory, Central Machinery Factory, Kunming Electric Smelting Plant, Central Wireless Electrical Equipment Factory Kunming Branch, Kunming Chemical Materials Factory, Kunhu Factory and several other factories. These are not only the best factories in Kunming in terms of equipment and employees, but they can also be counted among the best in the country. Except for Kunhu Factory, some of the above-mentioned factories have moved away from Kunming, while others have temporarily suspended work, waiting to be evacuated or liquidated. The Central Electrical Equipment Factory has moved to Nanjing and established a branch factory in Hankou. The Central Wireless Equipment Factory is on its way to Beiping. The Kunming Electric Smelting Plant and the Central Machinery Factory merged into one factory. The Kunming Chemical Materials Factory is at a standstill. The operating capacity of Kunhu Factory is only 10% of what it used to be. The normal output in the past was 4,000 kilowatts per day, but now it can only produce 400 kilowatts.

Although the situation of Yunnan Provincial factories is better, they have also been forced to reduce production, and the salary cuts and layoffs have also been reduced. High-paid employees and skilled workers are not cutting costs. Yudian Yarn Factory has now stopped night work and laid off many workers. Employees and workers have been laid off, and the factory has hired low-paid employees and female workers to replace them.

### The Dumping of Goods from the Warehouse Makes All Factories Feel Embarrassed

The embarrassing situation in which the factories in Kunming are currently in is mostly due to the fact that most of them were established during the war to adapt to the needs of the war. They are almost completely dependent on the agreed orders from the military, so this is a very natural trend. At this time, as the Sino-American forces withdrew and adjusted, these factories that emerged during the war naturally declined. The US military supply office announced its closure, and the result made 98% of Kunming's alcohol factories and machine factories also close down.

Many families bought a large amount of raw materials at high prices before the end of the war, so when prices plummeted, their production costs were still very high. This is one of the factors of loss. The big hoarders in Kunming were greatly panicked because the war ended suddenly, so within a few days of the Japanese surrender, they dumped a large amount of goods on the Kunming market, which further accelerated the sharp drop in market prices. (Translated from the February issue of the Miller Review)

### A Glimpse of the Supervision and Political Reform (Middle)

— Xu Erxin

Our country's salt management area has always had clear regulations, that is, the abundance of production in a certain area is limited to the transportation and sale to a certain shore, and a certain shore also sells the spirit of certain salt-producing areas, dividing the borders and boundaries between each other, and not mixing with each other. The Song Dynasty also established the law of entering orchids, and the Yuan Dynasty issued articles on violating the borders, prohibiting them very strictly, and following them from the Ming Dynasty to the present, following them without changing. Since the Republic of China, there has been a slight flexibility due to local conditions. This system of dividing the land and managing the spirit, with each having a fixed amount, is because salt is a necessity for people's food, and salt production is in a fixed place, unlike the five grains that can be planted anywhere. At that time, traffic was inconvenient, for

### Considering the People's Food

Planning must be made for a well-planned distribution to avoid excessive crowding and shortages, with the profound intention of balancing production and sales and regulating supply and demand. However, the distance varies from place to place (e.g., Zhenbujiuzhe, a village in Zhejiang, is hundreds of miles away from the salt fields, while Huai'an is separated by a river. Jingjiang is close to the Huai'an salt fields, but consumes Zhejiang salt because Zhenjiang is the throat of Zhejiang salt and Jingjiang is the gateway to Suzhou and Changzhou, used to block the encroachment of Huai'an smuggled salt). The difficulty of transportation varies (e.g., Tongshan and Suqian exclusively sell Eastern salt, drawing south from Yongfu and other salt fields, ranging from seven to eight hundred miles to a thousand miles, but it is close to Haizhou and Ganyu in northern Jiangsu. Previously, transporting from Tongshan and Suqian to Haizhou and Ganyu was very difficult by land and water. After the Longhai Railway opened, it would be more convenient to switch to selling Huaifeng salt). Given the current competitive situation, it is necessary to redraw these sales areas. In addition, tax rates and salt prices vary from place to place (for example, Huai salt sold in Liyang, western Hubei, requires additional insurance due to passing through heavy tax areas. In the upper four townships of Hangzhou, Zhejiang, the tax rate is specially levied, while the surrounding areas have very heavy taxes). Therefore, the sales volume of salt varies in different places. However, according to the law, selling salt from areas with sluggish sales to areas with high demand, or using salt from areas with low taxes to flood areas with high taxes, is considered smuggled salt. This unreasonable regulation needs fundamental reform. Although the system of designated merchants in designated areas has been abolished and a uniform tax system has been adopted, the sales areas should be rationally and appropriately divided according to the actual production and sales situation, based on the principle of the shortest distance, most convenient transportation, and lowest cost. This would ensure that the production of a certain salt field is allocated to a certain sales area, forming a rational and natural trend, fundamentally eliminating problems such as "cross-selling," "flooding," and "blending" sales. However, people can still freely purchase salt from various places without any restrictions. The salt industry company should stipulate appropriate transportation routes based on the divided sales areas. These transportation routes must be coordinated and closely linked with the inspection lines of the anti-smuggling agencies, so that smuggling can still be investigated along the lines after it occurs.

### Reader's Opinions: A Plea from Public School Teachers

Mr. Editor: Has the government already decided to encourage idleness? This question seems to be very affirmative. Because every time the salary class complains, they get a pay raise. Of course, we cannot but say that the government and dignitaries are appreciating the officials. But for those public school teachers with the lowest salaries, because they endure hardships and are unwilling to trouble the government, they endure, endure, and wait for fair treatment from the government. As a result, the government turns a blind eye, leaving them to suffer from hunger and cold. It seems to be hinting to them: "Those of you who have not been idle do not need a raise. If you want a raise, no one will care about you unless you complain." Is that so? Is this a clever way? Because of this, everyone suddenly realizes that it is impossible without the weapon of idleness. Isn't this encouraging idleness?

Sir, we do not want to trouble the government, do not want to use weapons to intimidate the most respected government, and do not want to abandon our duties. But we are also human beings and need food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. What do you think we should do?

I boldly request that the government treat us who do not complain the same as those who do complain, and even hope for more favorable treatment. This way, those who complain will realize that idleness is not the smartest behavior. Perhaps it can slightly reduce the trouble of those gentlemen running around to mediate! A public school teacher.

### Editorial: Don't Believe It? Let's Try Again!

"Justice is born from fairness" is an old saying that still holds true. "Onlookers see more of the game," but only truly objective onlookers who are not involved in their own interests can be selfless and achieve "clarity." Only true objectivity can lead to fairness and clear understanding. Once personal interests are involved, even clear and visible things can become blurred, leading to misjudgment. Even when others point it out, people still don't believe it. Why? Because "selfishness" blinds them! If they don't believe it, let them try again. What is painful is that China has been poor and weak for a hundred years, and suffered eight years of war. Today, like someone recovering from a serious illness, we cannot afford to experiment with dangerous remedies and suffer another disaster!

We have long said that post-war China will face two major obstacles: one is disguised aggression from abroad, and the other is an internal economic crisis. These two major obstacles are intertwined and mutually reinforcing. What is particularly worrying is that there is still a group of people in the country who secretly welcome the early arrival of these two major obstacles, believing that they will have an opportunity to show their skills when these obstacles arrive. Therefore, to resolve this crisis and break these two major obstacles, the only way is for the government to take responsibility, stand tall, make all political and economic facts public, embark on the path of true democracy, mobilize the great power of the people, and implement fair and wise effective policies. This will prevent those who hope for adversity from having any opportunity to use their skills. Only in this way will those who deliberately obstruct domestic peace not dare to obstruct it, those who deliberately undermine international peace not dare to undermine it, and those who are speculating and manipulating prices not dare to speculate and manipulate, harming the national economy. However, in recent months, we have only seen flattery from a few people, struggles between certain parties, territorial disputes and disturbances by certain armies, repeated delays in the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Northeast, procrastination and slowness in the handling of the takeover, and soaring prices and frequent labor strikes under the influence of speculative capital. The voices of the true people are still very weak, let alone their actions. It has been more than half a year since the Japanese surrendered, and the people were overjoyed! The golden age, the good opportunity, has been missed! But today, does the authorities have any regrets? Do the Communists have any desire to redeem themselves? Do social leaders and ordinary citizens have the mentality to learn from the pain and start anew? After seeing the situation in the half-month after the successful conclusion of the Political Consultative Conference, we are truly terrified.

Originally, China's victory and China's reputation as one of the "Big Four" were achieved by the great leader leading the soldiers in bloody and hard battles. Eight years of struggle was not easy. It is a pity that the general public, especially the bureaucrats and politicians, were blinded by victory. They thought that the opportunity to quickly seize power and resources had arrived, but they did not care about the country's major domestic and foreign policies. The people originally had unlimited expectations for the Political Consultative Conference, believing that all the gentlemen, whether in power or in opposition, would plan for the country and the nation. In particular, the Communist Party, which claims to represent the people, should put down the butcher knife. Even bandits can "wash their hands," let alone political struggles? Who knew that the result, in addition to the empty affirmation of the Three Principles of the People as the founding principle and support for President Chiang as the national leader, did not substantively solve any major domestic and foreign problems for the country and the nation. The Communist Party's occupation of territory remains the same, the obstruction of the takeover in the Northeast remains the same, the soaring prices remain the same, the people's livelihood remains unstable, and the incompetence of officials and the selfishness of parties are not only seen through by the people but also recognized by friendly countries. To the extent that it is self-inflicted, how can it not lead to more serious foreign aggression and a more urgent economic crisis?

Currently, everyone is shouting about the shadow over the Northeast, and everyone is roaring for heads to stabilize prices. It is a pity that when we pointed out that there were already dark clouds in the Northeast, some people still wanted to cover it up, insisting that the Northeast was a bright paradise and not allowing the people to say a word! It is a pity that when we want to investigate who is responsible for the speculative price increases, some people still want to use stopgap measures to muddle through, thinking that they can stabilize prices and secure the people's livelihood! It is clear that this road is impassable, but they don't believe it and think it makes perfect sense. They deceive, deceive, shout, and make noise, thinking that if they do this, the Communist army can be reorganized after the successful consultation, the Northeast can be recovered after the signing of the Sino-Soviet treaty, and prices can be stabilized after the auction of enemy property. But what is the result?

First, let's talk about the Northeast issue. It is clear that the ceasefire order between the government and the Chinese Communist Party stipulates that the entry of the National Army into the nine provinces of the Northeast or the mobilization within the nine provinces of the Northeast does not affect it. So why does the so-called Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party demand the recognition of 300,000 troops of the Democratic Allied Army in the Northeast, while restricting the number of National Army troops entering the Northeast? It is clear that the Sino-Soviet Treaty stipulates that the Soviet Union should fully provide moral and material assistance to the National Government. So why assist the so-called "Eighth Route Army" and "New Fourth Army" in establishing a democratic government? And why is there a "Eastern Mongolia Autonomous Republic"? And why did they allow Zhang Xinfu and others to be brutally murdered? And why did the Soviet troops delay their withdrawal again after the deadline? All of this shows that the Northeast issue is both an internal conflict and a foreign invasion; the Northeast issue is both a conspiracy of the Communist Party and a trick of the Soviet Union! The Sino-Soviet Treaty was signed by the plenipotentiaries of both parties, but China was in fact betrayed by the Yalta Secret Agreement! The Chinese people today will never repeat the Boxer Rebellion's xenophobia, but the Chinese people today will never be willing to be slaughtered by the great powers like in the late Qing Dynasty! And frankly speaking, the Communist Party today borrows foreign power to strengthen itself, hoping to occupy Liaodong to dominate. No matter what its purpose is, its intentions are almost the same as those of the puppet Manchurian Puyi. And Puyi was still an ignorant puppet, while the Communist Party steals the name of democracy and secretly acts like a tiger for the demon. We common people really don't understand why the government is tolerating the demon to this extent. Is there anyone who is a demon for the demon other than the demon? The Northeast is China's Northeast, and the administrative sovereignty of the Northeast should absolutely and entirely belong to China! The Northeast is an internationally valued Northeast, and the economic resources of the Northeast should be jointly developed internationally by China according to the teachings of the National Father, and should never be allowed to be monopolized by one country! We don't need to ask about the Yalta Secret Agreement, and we don't want to keep the Sino-Soviet Treaty alone (it only has value if both parties abide by it, otherwise it is equivalent to waste paper). To solve the Northeast issue, we only need to adhere to the twelve words "military and political unity, complete sovereignty, international development" as a guideline, so that there will be no major mistakes. If there are still people who don't believe it and just want to deceive the people, appease the demon, and please the powerful neighbors, then let them try the result of their methods again. They will inevitably completely lose the Northeast and cause a third world war!

Let's talk about the price issue. We have already offered our opinions. The methods to stabilize prices mainly include strictly prohibiting speculation, promoting production, reducing currency circulation, and distributing it evenly. These fair and easy-to-implement measures should be universally implemented without hesitation. However, what is the situation today? In terms of prohibiting speculation, it is prohibited in name but not in practice, prohibited in this place but not in another, verbally fined but not actually punished, checks are investigated for withdrawals but cash withdrawals are not, so the end result of this piecemeal approach is that prices will soar everywhere and become a tracking state, and the prices of various goods will rise and become a race. In terms of encouraging production, factories are auctioned off only for high prices, and when they can start operating is not asked; labor disputes are mediated only by raising wages, and whether the capital can afford it and the labor's skills are not asked; profitable things are handled by the government, easy things are run by the state, fuel must be controlled, applications are difficult to buy, and the private capital has no way out, so they look for other ways, which are not asked; land tax, raw material tax, finished product tax, capital tax, business tax, profit tax, transfer tax, lease tax, are levied repeatedly, with numerous procedures, and the cost is high, the restrictions are strict, which are not asked. With this approach, who would want to invest in production? In terms of reducing currency circulation, administrative institutions are piled up, government offices are full of redundant staff, public school teachers are complaining endlessly, and the national treasury's expenses almost entirely rely on printing money, which is not enough, and letting the public bonds rise and fall without considering issuing new public bonds; letting the gold jump wildly without considering the unlimited sale of gold or nationalizing it; ostensibly strictly investigating the exchange of checks to show the tightening of credit, but absolutely letting go of cash exchanged by banks, so people compete to withdraw cash to buy gold and materials instead of depositing it in banks. … All of these run counter to the purpose of reducing currency circulation. In terms of equal distribution, the organization of consumer cooperatives has not been valued by society. Not only has it not been valued, even suggestions are rarely heard; procurement is competed for by each; goods are competed for by each; rice and cloth are released only after the price is high, and the fair price is discounted according to the market, and the queue is squeezed, and it is announced to be sold out in a blink of an eye, but in reality it falls into the hands of speculators. Even if society has goods, it may not be able to provide the means for common people to support their families, but instead becomes a tool for transformed merchants to hoard and profit. In this way, how can prices not rise madly step by step! Therefore, from today's way, without changing today's customs, even if the authorities sing high-pitched songs about suppressing and stabilizing prices every day, prices will inevitably rise as before. Isn't this pouring soup to stop boiling and adding fuel to the fire? To tell another joke, isn't the market joking with the authorities, but the authorities are intentionally or unintentionally joking with the common people!

People suffer from not knowing themselves! The current officials are too confident! Some of them don't believe in the power of fair public opinion, don't believe in the support of international justice, don't believe in the mad shouts and screams of the people, don't believe in the straight words of the students, they only think that their own methods are all correct! They don't know themselves, let's try again!

### Students in Shanghai Launch Patriotic Movement Vowing to Be the Government's Backbone, Upholding National Territorial Sovereignty

A Grand Meeting for the Protection of Rights Movement is Established and a Parade Scheduled for Today

Secondly, they will go to the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that the person in charge there report the current situation in the Northeast to all students. Finally, they will go to the Soviet Consulate to request that the students' opinions be conveyed to the Soviet government, that the Northeast immediately withdraw its troops, that the heavy industry that was taken away be returned to our country, and that all other conditions except those stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Agreement cannot be accepted.

Student Union Responds

In addition, the Shanghai Student Union has started responding to the patriotic movement of Chiao Tung University yesterday. At 8 p.m. last night, representatives from various schools held a preparatory meeting for the memorial service for Zhang Xinfu at Yucai Middle School. Patriotic slogans posted by students could be seen everywhere in the Nanjing Road area. Shanghai Lin University also held a meeting in the first and second branch classes and the general class at 2 p.m. yesterday to discuss the opinions on maintaining the integrity of territorial sovereignty. The meeting proceeded in an atmosphere of sorrow and indignation for three hours before adjourning. It was decided to organize a patriotic movement committee and post slogans all over the city, including (1) Demand that the government adopt strong diplomacy.

Also, according to news reports, the Shanghai Student Union convened representatives from major middle schools in the city at Yucai Middle School Auditorium at 8 p.m. last night to hold a preparatory meeting for the memorial service for martyr Zhang Xinfu. More than 200 student representatives from more than 70 schools, including St. John's University, Soochow University, University of Shanghai, Peiming, and Fu Jen, attended. Twelve units, including National Chiao Tung University and Aurora University, were elected as executive members. The resolutions passed at the meeting were: (1) Establish the "Shanghai Student Rights Protection Movement Assembly." (2) Methods of implementation: (A) Hold a memorial service for martyrs such as Zhang Xinfu at Aurora University at 10 a.m. on the 26th, followed by a parade. (B) Hold a parade and rally at the Bund Park today. (3) Issue a declaration.

Telegram to Chairman

The telegram from the Patriotic Student Movement Assembly of Chiao Tung University to Chairman Chiang, urging him to adopt a firm attitude, reads: To Chairman Chiang of the Chongqing National Government: Since the violent Japanese bandits occupied the Northeast and the compatriots outside the pass were displaced, they have long been subjected to humiliation and abuse. They looked forward to the arrival of the righteous army more than to clouds and rain. Under your wise and virtuous leadership, we have endured hardships, lived together, and taught, so we feel the pain of the fathers and elders outside the pass more than if it were our own. This feeling and intention have never been released. Since the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, thanks to your wise leadership and the soldiers' bloodshed, justice has warned the public, and victory has been achieved, which can save our fathers and elders from deep water and fire. However, all the reports from Lingnan say that the Northeast is getting darker and darker every day. Is it not enough to recover the Northeast after fourteen years of weeping and eight years of bloodshed? Has the war in the five continents not won complete peace? We have witnessed the territorial sovereignty of the country repeatedly being humiliated. The Soviet troops have been slow to withdraw, Zhang Xinfu has been brutally murdered, and innocent people in Shenyang have been shot. The changing situation is appalling. Looking at Shanhaiguan, we are filled with indignation. We dare to take the liberty to vow to be the government's backbone and work for complete peace. We beseech you to adopt a firm attitude to maintain the integrity of national territorial sovereignty, so that the great cause of national construction can be developed and our China can forever become a prosperous, strong, and free country. The Patriotic Student Movement Assembly of National Chiao Tung University bows respectfully.

The conference also sent telegrams to all schools and organizations across the country, urging them to be the backbone of the country and jointly participate in this righteous cause. At the same time, it sent telegrams to the student unions of National Central University and Chongqing University, asking them to forward them to the schools and organizations participating in the patriotic movement, saying that they had learned that their schools were launching a movement of three strikes and one parade for the sake of loving the motherland, which was a magnificent, enthusiastic, and indignant demonstration of patriotism worthy of commendation. They must strive to maintain the integrity of national territorial sovereignty and forever protect our free and equal status. Although we are thousands of miles apart, our hearts are completely united. We hope to maintain contact and provide guidance.

Declaration to Compatriots

The Patriotic Student Movement Representatives Conference of National Chiao Tung University issued a declaration yesterday, respectfully informing compatriots: (1) Support the government in adopting strong diplomacy to maintain the integrity of national territorial sovereignty. (2) Resolutely reject any Soviet demands on our country other than those stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Treaty. (3) In order to achieve complete peace, we vow to be the government's backbone to the death. (4) The Northeast shall not be given special status. (5) East Mongolia shall not be given special status. (6) Investigate the conspiracy behind the murder of Zhang Xinfu. (7) Absolutely do not recognize the Yalta Agreement. (8) The economic negotiations with the Soviet Union should be made public to the world. (9) Fourteen years of tears and eight years of blood cannot be shed in vain. (10) Do not want to see a second "September 18th Incident."

### Commander-in-Chief He's Residence Burglarized; Case Solved Swiftly in Eight Hours

All Stolen Goods Recovered and Two Criminals Apprehended

[Report from Our Newspaper] The private residence of Army Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin at 1634 Linsen Middle Road was burgled the night before last (the 20th) after midnight. Thieves broke into the living room and stole a porcelain chicken dish, twelve porcelain meat basins, nine porcelain teacups, and over a hundred antique items. They carried the stolen goods out and by dawn, at 5:30 AM, hired a rickshaw to transport them to 2, Caishen Lane, Danfeng Road in the South City, where they hid them at Yu Mingde's home. That morning, the servants at the He residence discovered the major theft and immediately reported it to the Municipal Police Bureau, which forwarded it to the Changshu Precinct in charge, ordering them to solve the case within 24 hours. Precinct Chief Fu Sugang immediately instructed Zhang Canguang, the Chief of the Judicial Section, to dispatch officers within the precinct to notify all pawnshops and consignment stores to report to the precinct for investigation if the aforementioned stolen goods were brought in for pawn or sale. By 11:30 AM, two people indeed arrived at 472 Linsen Road, Wan Jin Ji Consignment Shop, carrying a large number of stolen goods by rickshaw for sale. However, the shop had already been notified by the precinct. Upon careful examination of the stolen goods, they matched the reported stolen items. The shop assistants pretended to be agreeable and bought all the stolen goods for 120,000 legal tender. As they were leaving, one of the assistants followed them to the aforementioned residence of Yu Mingde at 2 Caishen Lane, South City, and secretly reported the situation to the Changshu Precinct. In the afternoon, Precinct Chief, Deputy Chief Huang Zhen, and the Director of the Judicial Section led officers Li Jiapu, Liu Shizhu, Li Pengfei, Wang Chenglong, etc., to wait and watch. At 10:30 AM yesterday morning, they apprehended both criminals on the spot. Under interrogation, one was named Zhu Yao, 23 years old, from Pudong, a high school student. The other, the receiver of stolen goods, Yu Mingde, confessed to the theft without hesitation. They were then taken to Wan Jin Ji, where all the stolen goods were recovered.

### Authorities Determine Emergency Measures for Soaring Rice Prices

With the black market price of gold repeatedly soaring, rice profiteers are taking advantage of the situation. Over the past two days, the price of rice has increased by more than 10,000. The Grain Administration Commissioner Yang Xizhi flew to Nanjing the day before yesterday to request instructions on emergency measures from the Changju Bureau. It is reported that Mr. Yang returned to Shanghai last night and has determined methods to suppress grain prices. Yesterday, the price of rice continued to rise with the black market price of gold. Before 9:00 AM, the Grain Administration Commissioner's Office first released 5,000 *shi* of *wuxian* rice at a price of 18,000 (the day before yesterday it was 10,000 *shi*). At that time, the price of *bai geng* rice from various firms immediately stood at 28,000. After fluctuating for a while, news suddenly came that the black market price of gold had jumped dramatically, and the price of rice soared to 31,000. The supply exceeding demand was truly shocking.

### How to Resist Wild Speculation and Buying

— Our Reporter Canglong

Gold knocks at the 2 million mark, U.S. dollars at 2,650 yuan, *bai geng* rice shouts over 32,000 yuan… everything else is rising irrationally and wildly! Every day a fiery page is acted out! Every day new highs are created!

Economists rack their brains to analyze, concluding that this is due to political instability, subtle international relations, unannounced exchange rates, inflation, transportation difficulties, lack of material supply, unrecovered production, speculative manipulation, hoarding… this series of well-worn arguments still cannot decipher the riddle of the constantly rising speculative market!

Chen

Xing, the Financial and Monetary Commissioner for the Nanjing-Shanghai District, said: We are an agency executing orders. We report the financial and monetary dynamics here to the central Changju Bureau and the Municipal Government in Chongqing every day, awaiting approval of handling methods. On the one hand, we do our best to take necessary measures within our jurisdiction.

Speaking of

the recent suspension of gold sales by the Bank of China in Chongqing, Commissioner Chen said that this move was not a cessation of gold sales, but because the purchasers were too crowded during the issuance, and the order was somewhat chaotic, so the sales were temporarily suspended. After finding ways to improve it, the sales would be continued. This created a stimulating factor for the nervous Shanghai market. Secondly, the recent bleak situation in the Northeast also has a stimulating effect on people's minds. Speaking of this, he gave an example: Recently, because of the complex and confusing international relations, the New York stock market, which has always been a downstream market, has also revealed signs of weakness. Finally, he said that he was waiting for the orders of the central authorities so that he could follow them!

Leaving the

Financial Commissioner's Office, I stepped into the gate of the Grain Administration Commissioner's Office. The Grain Commissioner, Yang Xizhi, flew to Nanjing early the day before yesterday. The purpose of this trip was to discuss emergency grain administration measures with Grain Vice-Minister Pang Songzhou and others. The reporter was received by a senior official of the office and asked why the Grain Administration had repeatedly devalued and sold *wu xian* rice to the rice market, but rice merchants had not publicly sold the devalued *wu xian* rice. It was also faintly heard that the large batch of *wu xian* rice that the Grain Administration had sold to the rice merchants at 8,000-9,000 yuan per *shi* was still in the warehouse and had not been put on the market. Could the rice merchants who purchased the devalued *wu xian* rice be forced to add a legitimate profit and quickly bring it to the market? He said that Commissioner Yang's trip to Nanjing to discuss with Vice-Minister Pang would definitely have good emergency measures. He believed that the new measures would definitely have ways to improve the various problems mentioned by the reporter.

Yesterday

morning, the police bureau was ordered to send officers to the Securities Exchange Building to notify each securities firm to remove the intercom telephones. If they did not comply, the Public Utilities Bureau would forcibly remove them. At around 11 o'clock, someone was dealing in the bond market on the seventh floor. The market was booming, and the market was one-sided with demand exceeding supply. Suddenly, four policemen came, and four or five people who were doing transactions were arrested. Yesterday, the General Headquarters took temporary emergency measures to devalue flour by 6,000 yuan per bag and sell it off completely without restriction. People's hearts relaxed, and the price of flour stopped rising and started to fall. The Grain Administration also posted an emergency announcement in the rice market, restricting non-professionals from entering the market for trading. The market gate became heavily guarded… It cannot be said that the authorities are not interfering with the speculative market!

But

the shoeshine boy on the street raised his head and said to the reporter with full confidence: The only lesson the eight years of war taught him was to get rid of banknotes and hoard materials! The rickshaw puller, when negotiating prices with the reporter, also rattled off his set of bargaining arguments: "Rice is going to be 300 yuan per *sheng*! Do you know that?" The stores on the roadside with "Internal Reorganization, Temporarily Closed for a Few Days" signs are gradually increasing. The clerks in the gold shops are all lazily leaning against the counter. A villager wearing homespun, with a bulging money belt around his waist, approached and pleaded to sell a small ring. The clerk raised his righteous posture and said: We abide by the law and do not do business. The rice in the rice shops, good or bad, only has one kind left. It's up to you whether you want it or not… All this that cannot be exhausted is also fact.

The reporter

couldn't help but feel confused? Will victory ultimately dawn on Shanghai? The price paid by the five million citizens for victory seems can't be snatched away by the adventurers in the paradise! It looks like the central authorities will not be without emergency measures, but these measures must come as quickly as thunder covers the ears, and this stick must be struck thoroughly to make Shanghai a truly permanent paradise.

### Telecommunications Workers' Strike Still Unresolved; Reaches Stalemate Yesterday; National Official and Commercial Telegrams Suspended for Two Hours

The work slowdown at the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, which has been ongoing, remained at a stalemate as of 6:00 PM last night and has not been resolved. Military telegrams, news telegrams, and weather reports were all suspended for a period of time from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM. However, after 3:00 PM, they continued to be maintained. At 6:00 PM, the employees convened a general meeting again to jointly discuss sending representatives to continue their request to the bureau. If the two sides can come closer, work can be resumed at any time.

Arbitration Requested for Newspaper Industry Dispute

The newspaper workers in this city have a dispute with the newspaper offices over their request for higher pay. The Social Bureau convened labor and management for mediation twice, but ultimately, due to the issue of the base wage, the two sides were too far apart and failed to reach an agreement, so the mediation was declared unsuccessful. As a result, the Social Bureau agreed that the base wage should be 45, calculated based on the rise and fall of the worker's cost of living index. The mediation agreement has been sent to both labor and management, but the newspaper offices still feel that the base wage agreed by the Social Bureau is too high and cannot afford it, and have applied to the Municipal Government for arbitration. The work strike at the Commercial Press has been completely resolved and business has resumed as usual from 9:00 AM yesterday morning.

Cotton Spinning Strike Situation Expands

[Report from Our Newspaper] The cotton spinning industry strike in the third and fourth districts and the weaving industry strike.

As a result, an agreement has been reached on the issues of working hours and holiday pay. (2) The mechanical personnel of China Airlines went on strike yesterday afternoon, requesting the company to adjust the cost of living to the level line. (3) All employees of the Shanghai branch of Minsheng Industrial Company went on strike on the day before yesterday to request improved benefits. All ships sailing in Shanghai yesterday did not depart. Yesterday afternoon, representatives of both sides continued to meet and negotiate, and as a result, opinions have become closer. The workers of Shenxin No. 9 Factory at the intersection of Gordon Road and Macau Road went on strike yesterday because their request for a wage increase was not granted.

### Social Service; Severely Damaged Areas in the South City and Zhabei; Feces and Urine Flow Everywhere, Pollution is Alarming

The Health of Five Million Citizens is at Stake, Urgent Cleaning is Needed

Dear Editor: It has been brought to my attention that this city, previously occupied by enemy bandits, suffered major damage in the old South City and Zhabei areas. Most of the houses were destroyed, and ruins and broken tiles are everywhere. After a long period of abandonment, they have been used for accumulating garbage, which has become increasingly widespread, reaching several feet high in some places. The situation continues to deteriorate and is extremely polluted. Furthermore, most of our compatriots disregard public hygiene and further spoil the dirty places, even using them as latrines, resulting in feces and urine flowing everywhere, making the filth even worse. Passing through these areas, the stench is unbearable! It is found that the population in this area has increased sharply since the victory, and it is closely connected with the old concession area. However, our municipal authorities, perhaps due to insufficient personnel, have not yet paid attention to rectifying the sanitation issues in this area. Although the winter season has barely passed, the outbreak of epidemics is already foreseen at the beginning of spring, which is obvious. However, the humid summer will arrive soon, and the garbage and feces will be exposed to the sun and wind, and the foul air will evaporate and spread everywhere. Flies and mosquitoes will gather, breed, and spread germs, which will inevitably spread like wildfire. At that time, we will see vicious epidemics raging and out of control. It will be too late to prevent them. The lives of the people are like grass, and the suffering is unbearable to imagine! The harm to the health of five million citizens is extremely serious. Thinking of this, I feel particularly fearful. Recently, our Chairman Chiang Kai-shek declared in the temporary capital that public health should be listed as the first step in national revival and construction. Readers, with the qualifications of Shanghai citizens, have written letters to complain, appealing to send personnel for detailed inspection and immediately order the Shanghai Municipal Government to order the Health and Public Works Bureaus to be responsible for clearing the garbage and ruins in the area within a limited time to ensure public health for the entire city. Five million citizens will share the benefits, and national health will depend on it. I have always admired your newspaper's enthusiasm for public welfare and service to the people. I am sending another letter, please publish it and I urge all the Shanghai news industry authorities and medical experts to write articles, encourage publicity, and promote our compatriots to pay attention to prevention, especially our municipal authorities. It is urgent to strictly stipulate penalty rules, supervise the subordinate agencies, and use the Baojia system to jointly promote and implement effective results, which will be immeasurable merit. The society is fortunate. I respectfully wish you good writing. Respectfully, a reader of Shenbao

### Telephone Calls to Securities Exchange Removed, "Sha Chi" Prices Still Rising; US Dollar Also a Speculation Target

"Sha Chi" transactions were even more secretive yesterday. People were extremely worried as the international situation continued to worsen. The buying frenzy remained strong, and authorities cracked down even harder. Only a few firms were engaged in buying and selling, and floating capital poured into foreign currencies. After "Sha Chi" reached high prices, it entered a consolidation phase. The general trend was not as lively as the US dollar. It was found that morning opened had already jumped to around 1.85 million, and at the highest point, it was pushed to around 1.95 million. Taking advantage of the high prices, there was a flow of cutting losses and hedging US dollars, once falling back to 1.82 million. At noon, it was about 1.88 million, a further increase of 230,000 compared to the previous close. The afternoon then gradually stabilized, but the prices and transactions were very chaotic. First, it was seen at around 1.93 million, but after the intercom telephones were removed and the crackdown intensified, it retreated to the 1.9 million mark. Decorated gold had no market, and silver jumped to 2,000 yuan. Silver dollars once rose to 1,200, and finally 1,100, with private trading from 1 jiao 8 fen to 2 jiao 5 fen.

Stimulated by the wild jump in the gold market, the foreign currency US dollar was brought up as soon as the market opened. Some of the floating capital gradually showed fatigue with the gold market, and the US dollar was first favored. At the same time, there was a steady demand for US cotton and material settlements. It rose in a fluctuating manner. Hedging against gold gradually rose from 750 yuan per 10 taels to slightly more than 700 yuan. The morning opening was remembered to have jumped to over 2,500 yuan, and settlements were eager. There were more monks than porridge, and it gradually rose to 2,750 yuan, and then the gold market brought it down to around 2,650 yuan, hovering around. In the afternoon, it rose again to over 2,700, resulting in a further increase of 340 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were also affected by settlement, and old goods rose to around 430 yuan, resulting in an increase of 60 yuan. In addition to being brought up by old goods, new goods were also favored by speculators, and also rose by 18 yuan.

### Securities Still Jumping Wildly Under Mobile Gatherings; It is Heard that Someone in the Industry Has Been Arrested

Public bonds were still being absorbed by scattered floating capital, initially stabilizing and then strengthening. After a high point, it slightly declined due to the more severe crackdown. Class C gradually rose from 1,720 yuan to 2,080 yuan, and finally struggled below 1,950 yuan. As a result, Class A, B, and D each improved by 230 yuan, Class C rose by 200 yuan, and Class E rose by 250 yuan. Yesterday, there were mobile gatherings with liquidity in Shanghai stocks. Yongsha jumped wildly from 2,500 yuan to near the 3,000 yuan mark. Meiya rose from 2,200 yuan to 2,400 yuan, and Jingfu rose from 130 yuan to 147 yuan. Then, it was heard that someone in the industry had been arrested, and it quickly fell back. Large stocks fell back by more than 10%, and small stocks fell by about half, but compared to the previous close, they still rose sharply by about 20%. Foreign stocks were also brought up by 15% to 20%, but the transactions were few and far less than stocks and bonds.

### Yarn and Cotton Cloth Buying Fever

Yesterday, the yarn market rose wildly. From the opening to the closing, the buying was extremely strong in a fervent atmosphere. 20-count yarn of each brand rose by 150,000 to 200,000, and 42-count also jumped by 300,000. Looking at the closing, the prices of various counts of yarn generally rose by 15% to 20%.

The cloth market leaped like a swimming dragon. It is said that the gray cloth market repeatedly called for high prices, and the sales of colored cloth, such as blue cloth, were only enough to cover the cost of gray cloth. Dyeing was equivalent to being given away for free. Seeing this situation, the factories were particularly tight on prices. Although the customers had the appetite to absorb, there was no way to enter.

Yesterday, the spot cotton trading was less colorful, but the market price was frequently strong. Those who held goods tightened their prices extremely tightly, so it was difficult for both buyers and sellers to approach negotiations, so the transaction was a little sparse, and the price rose another 3,000 to 5,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Silk Prices Surged Fiercely

Yesterday, the silk market rose even more fiercely than the previous day. The high-grade five-dan head was bid as high as 2.8 million yuan. In the afternoon, there was a transaction at 2.6 million yuan, which was also a "kicking the ball" business. The mid-grade lingzu was 2.4 million yuan, an increase of 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The dry-warp five-dan head was bid 200,000 yuan higher than the previous day, but there was no transaction. 120 Tianqiao ren silk spot was traded at 2.6 million yuan in the morning, and the off-site price was reduced by 100,000 yuan in the afternoon, and finally fell by another 100,000 yuan, resulting in an increase of 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Stocks of dull-finish and semi-luster goods were extremely scarce, and prices were raised. 120 Tianqiao dull-finish was bid at 3 million yuan, and the price of miscellaneous brand semi-luster goods was the same as Tianqiao luster. The prices of heavy goods continued to rise. The Meiya quilt cover and Dacheng gebi crepe both rose by 10%, and Minsheng brocade rose by 1,000 yuan.

### Rice Market Confused

The rice and grain market yesterday still lacked formal transactions. The early market was chaotic. Although there was little trading at noon, neither merchants nor shops officially traded. Cheap flour was selling well, and factory flour and miscellaneous brand flour fell by 600-700 yuan. Yih Wah Foreign Company has ordered 600 tons of Australian flour, estimated at around 6,000 yuan, to be shipped in March. The oil market increased by 5,000-6,000 yuan, soybeans increased by 2,000-3,000 yuan, raw kernels increased by 2,000 yuan, bean cakes increased by 1,000 yuan, wheat bran increased by 500-600 yuan, and persimmon cakes increased by 1,000 yuan.

### Brief News

The Shanghai Provisional University Preparatory Class will officially begin instruction on March 1st at the former Central Hospital in Fenglinqiao. The second round of enrollment applications was quite enthusiastic. The exam is scheduled for today.

The existing school buildings of the Lixin Accounting College are insufficient. The founder, Pan Xulun, donated a portion of his private property at 466 Lane, Pushi Road, Nos. 3, 4, 5, and 6, as school buildings. The original tenants of the building, a total of ten households, were requested to vacate early due to the school's difficulties. An application for mediation was filed, but to no avail. The matter was taken to court. Recently, the court ordered the tenants to vacate within three months, and permission was granted for provisional execution. The school's problem of recovering the school buildings should be resolved by then.

The Municipal Education Bureau has established the Municipal Fuxing Middle School at No. 191 Sichuan North Road (the former site of the Municipal Council School). The first new student entrance examination is scheduled for the 24th and 25th of this month. The registration deadline is 6:00 PM today.

### Group A Football League: Qingbai Meets British Navy

3:00 PM at Jiaozhou Park

The Group A football league is gradually entering an intense phase. The competition between the two strong Chinese teams, Donghua and Qingbai, is a major event, ensuring that the championship does not fall into foreign hands. Today at 3:00 PM at the Jiaozhou Park Stadium on Changping Road, there will be a Group A match between Qingbai and the British Navy, which should be the team's only strong opponent before the league match against Donghua.

Since Yan Shixin and Li Shuo You's return, Qingbai's strength has increased. They have also recruited players from Chongqing and Hong Kong. Goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai has arrived in Shanghai, but due to circumstances, he will have to wait a while before playing. Therefore, Huang Shijie is internally scheduled to fill the role today. The rest of the team will be arranged ideally, with a determination to win. The strength of the British Navy is quite solid, and they are known for their English style of long passes and distant shots. Qingbai must exert extra effort to have any hope.

### Women and the Family

— Editor

The relationship between women and the family has always seemed much closer than that of men. Although a family cannot be formed by women alone without men, the traditional custom is for women to manage household affairs while men work outside. Therefore, the terms "women" and "family" are naturally linked together.

However, women in the family must not think that there is no place for women in society and politics apart from the family. Society is composed of many "individuals," and in theory, women account for half of the world's population. As for the political arena, women have had less involvement in the past. However, in recent years, after women in various countries have obtained the right to vote, they have often demonstrated the power to influence politics. After World War II, French women gained the right to vote, and as a result, women gained thirty-two seats. The number of women voters also exceeded that of men. Japanese women will soon gain the right to vote. It is estimated that the number of Japanese women who have the right to vote will also exceed the number of men. It can be seen that the political potential of women is enormous. Women compatriots must not underestimate their own strength.

Hygiene

### Developing Hygienic Habits in Children

— Tracing the Cause

The term "hygiene" has been introduced into our country for decades. Due to active promotion and publicity in writing, speech, and action (such as the personal street sweeping led by the Municipal Council), almost everyone, from the intellectual class to porters and vendors, knows it and uses it as a buzzword. There's "hygienic soy sauce," "hygienic fermented bean curd," and even those Shaoxing old officials selling dried tofu in the streets and alleys add the word "hygienic" to the titles of five-spice or mushroom tofu. As for whether those foods are actually "hygienic," heaven knows! Often, when someone dumps garbage or feces in the sewers or outside the trash cans in the neighborhoods, and others or the neighborhood managers see it, they ask, "Do you understand hygiene?" Well, who doesn't understand "hygiene?" It's just that Chinese people understand but don't practice. There is a big gap between knowledge and practice.

This is not only the case in the lower classes, but also among the middle and upper classes who have received education and have a considerable understanding of the meaning of "hygiene." Many of them also have bad habits such as spitting, urinating, and littering, as well as various unhygienic phenomena expressed in clothing, food, housing, and other aspects, which are not much better than those of the general lower classes. A friend once told me that his comprador, while lying in a rocking chair and talking to a foreigner, often coughed up phlegm and simply turned his head and spat it on the ground. My friend felt ashamed and uneasy when he saw it, but the comprador looked calm and unconcerned! Although it was not my friend who spat, he felt that he shared this shame because he and the comprador were both Chinese!

Upon closer examination, the crux of the problem of why they know but cannot act lies in their lack of hygienic habits. Because they grew up in traditional unhygienic family environments, their parents did not teach them hygienic habits. When they grow up, although they have hygiene knowledge, the habits of laziness and casualness have already been formed. To ask them to abide by hygiene rules is simply to torture them. They believe that these hygiene rules are just theories and high-sounding words in books that cannot be practiced in the real environment. "Everyone else does it, so I can't be an exception." "It's too much trouble to follow these hygiene rules all the time." Indeed, it is too tiring for someone who does not have this habit to pay attention to and comply with hygiene rules at all times.

Therefore, to have a hygienic life, it is not enough to simply understand the meaning of hygiene. We must also have hygienic habits. The earlier this habit is cultivated, the better, because the younger the age, the greater the plasticity, and the easier and more deeply rooted the habit is to cultivate. If we wait until bad habits have formed and then try to correct them, it is like drawing irregular lines on a blank sheet of paper, erasing them with an eraser, and then drawing regular lines. The regular lines cannot be clear and distinct. From the moment a baby is born, their body should be kept clean and dry, and they should start to develop clean habits of skin touch. When they are a little older, they should be washed and have their noses wiped often. When the child understands, they should be taught to wash and wipe automatically—you may think it is more convenient for you to wash and wipe for them than for them to do it themselves, but you must never do this—and make them aware of what is clean and what is dirty. They should not be allowed to use their hands to hold wet and greasy things when eating. If their hands get greasy with oil, sugar juice, or salty brine, they must be washed immediately, otherwise they should not be allowed to pull and tug at things or scratch their heads and ears. Many children's skin diseases are caused in this way—although we may not be able to see anything on the body with our eyes, the child's sensitive skin will feel the irritation, causing itching, and the itching will break the skin, allowing germs to enter. This can lead to sores, scabies, and the like.

When children grow to a certain age and have a certain amount of physical strength, they should be taught to wash their own towels, clothes, socks, and to sweep and wipe, etc. This will not only cultivate their cleaning habits, but also allow them to learn to work and exercise their physical strength, so that they will not be dependent on servants in the future and have the habits of young masters and young ladies. Other good hygienic habits, such as getting up early, going to bed early, eating on time, going to the toilet on time, bathing often, changing clothes, not spitting, urinating, littering, covering the mouth with a head or handkerchief when coughing or sneezing, and not using public towels, cups, plates, etc., should be cultivated from childhood. Then, habit becomes nature, and adults can follow various hygiene rules at any time and place without having to use conscious effort to control themselves. Not only will they enjoy the happiness of health and maintain a clean and polite appearance because of this, but they will also not hinder the hygiene and health of others.

Essay

### Arguments Between Husband and Wife

— Fei Wen

Arguments between husband and wife are unavoidable. Many people think that when an argument occurs in a family, everything is over. In fact, this does not correspond to the facts. A Mr. Hubbard once wrote in the American Women's Family Magazine that if a couple has been together for twenty-five years without arguing, then they seem to lack spirit. Rather than saying that arguments are the end of everything, it is more accurate to say that arguments are the beginning of everything.

Because behind every argument, there must be a considerable problem. These problems are waiting to be resolved. If they are not resolved, then enduring them will only produce deeper pain.

At the same time, if a couple is always perfunctory in order to avoid arguments, it is somewhat close to hypocrisy. A couple must not be hypocritical to have a happy life. Therefore, if there is any problem that must be discussed, it is perfectly fine to discuss it, even to the point of arguing. However, after the argument, a solution can be found.

Therefore, arguments between husband and wife can be divided into two types: positive and negative. Positive arguments are centered on the problem. After the argument, a solution can be found. Negative arguments are a type of unreasonable disturbance.

During an argument, one party is the attacker and the other is the resister. This resister actually has a moral responsibility, that is, they should analyze whether the other party's argument is due to illness, stimulation, or nervous unease. If the argument is due to these reasons, then one must have some tolerance so that the argument can subside in the shortest possible time.

Normally, arguments can be divided into three stages. The first stage is the beginning. At the beginning, it is just a minor dispute. But if it cannot be stopped, then it will enter the second stage, which is a fierce debate, including sarcasm, etc. Arguments often occur at night. After a night, because the spirit is more peaceful, the atmosphere will be calmer. Therefore, the second stage can be as short as a few minutes or as long as a few hours, depending entirely on the situation of the parties involved. The third stage is the ending stage. Everything has an end, even international wars have an end. After an argument, both parties hope to reconcile. At that time, as long as one party is willing to admit a little loss, the argument can be ended.

Therefore, since arguments are unavoidable in the family, we must know the process of arguments and handle them appropriately. (This article is an excerpt from Mr. Xu Baiyi's lecture on family problems at the Qingnian Wenhua Dianhe Academic Forum)

Knowledge

### Home Cooking School

— Qi Hong

Ms. Wang Ding Xiuzhen went to Columbia University in the United States for further study after graduating from McTyeire School. At that time, she realized the importance of home economics to women's lives, so she studied it carefully. After returning to China, she served as a cooking instructor at her alma mater and Aurora College for Women. Because some students sought tutoring after class, she founded the Home Cooking School, located at No. 4, Gao'enfang, Daxing Road (at the intersection of Avenue Lafayette and Route Massenet), Shanghai. She teaches the preparation of various Chinese and Western dishes and pastries. At first, there were only five students, but it has gradually increased to more than 100. Students can be divided into three types: high school or university girls, working women, and housewives. The school is divided into five classes, with about 25 people in each class. The class time is chosen to be most convenient for most students, each class lasting from two to three hours. In class, Mrs. Wang first explains the items, cooking methods, and things to be used, and then the students automatically cook according to the method. She is always on hand to point out the tricks for successful cooking and the problems with various failures. After the cooking is completed, the whole class shares the food together, and then the expenses for that experiment are divided equally according to the number of people. So the interest is very strong.

Mrs. Wang believes that even in the 20th century, in the age of advanced science, women should still return to the kitchen. She said: Just look at the married women in Europe and the United States, and you can say that not one of them does not know how to cook. This is clear evidence that women and the kitchen are inseparable. As far as the current society is concerned, only a very small number of working women are exclusively engaged in careers, while more than 90% are still housewives. A housewife hopes that her family is a place full of joy and happiness, and health is the primary condition for a happy family. To make a family healthy, the most important thing to pay attention to is the daily diet.

A virtuous housewife must know how to make her husband feel the snacks given by the family, and there must be a very good arrangement so that he will feel satisfied and will not mess around outside, and he will have more interest in work. Therefore, cooking can directly help housewives to organize a healthy and happy family, and indirectly help society and the country, because a healthy family can produce promising young people.

She also said that most of the housewives in our country have forgotten their responsibilities and only know how to socialize and gamble all day long. They can be said to be completely ignorant of housework. They give their children to servants to manage or send them to school. As for their usual behavior and grades at school, they don’t care at all. They think that the responsibility of teaching their children should be entirely borne by the school. This erroneous concept deprives their children of the most important and precious family education. This negligence has resulted in all kinds of criminals and destroyed countless young people. Therefore, she has a plan, that is, after she can recover a house occupied by Russians on Avenue Joffre, she not only prepares to expand the cooking department, but also to add sewing and children's education departments, so that women in our country can further understand the knowledge of housework and childrearing. Regarding this plan, she feels that she cannot do it alone, so her students can give her a helping hand.

I think that the establishment of such a home economics school is what the women in our country are eagerly awaiting, especially at this time of national construction, so I hope that in addition to Mrs. Wang's students, everyone should give it the greatest help so that it can be established as soon as possible.

### Save the Children!

— Cheng Yi

"Save the children!" This is the last sentence of Mr. Lu Xun's "Diary of a Madman." This powerful and sincere cry, recognizing the warmth and honesty in children's hearts, was spoken more than twenty years ago. Before the war, there was the slogan "The 20th century is the century of the child." After eight years of the War of Resistance, this slogan has gradually faded, replaced by "The 20th century is the century of adults." The future adults are children, but what are the lives of children like now? Just look at the corpses of children lining the streets, the beggars at restaurant doors, the candy sellers in theaters, the newsboys with hoarse voices, the child laborers in factories; some skillfully smoking cigarettes, playing poker, spreading bad habits; parents venting their anger after returning home, often unreasonably scolding them. In wealthy families, children are abandoned and entrusted to ignorant maids, while the parents indulge in entertainment all day long, or are excessively doting. In schools, the rigid, rote learning and regulated education are greatly at odds with the development of children's nature.

Now people demand democracy, and children also demand life—respecting children, encouraging the development of their activities, with guidance and more reasonable living and education; pay attention to the children!

### A New Life Begins at Home

— Xu Baiyi

The publication of this issue of our journal coincides with New Life Movement Week, and at the same time, the goals of various countries are shifting towards the family. For example, this newspaper recently published the following news:

First, our reporter, Mai Tian, ​​specially visited Madame Chiang Kai-shek, who said: "Many people often overlook the status and importance of housewives. In fact, this is wrong. The responsibility of housewives is very important, especially during the War of Resistance. They not only have to take care of their husbands and children and manage household affairs, but also constantly help their husbands with their work. Their contribution to the country is indeed equal to that of their husbands."

Second, Mayor Qian also said in his article "Looking Ahead to the Twelfth Anniversary of the New Life Movement": "The New Life Movement promotes a disciplined life of 'propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame.' Practice these virtues in daily life—in the 'four essentials of clothing, food, shelter, and transportation.'"

Third, in order to strengthen the promotion of family education, the Ministry of Education has specially stipulated that all levels of public education centers throughout the country should take the promotion of family education as their main task, and other social education institutions at all levels should each use their strengths to promote family education.

Since the victory of the War of Resistance, our country must immediately embark on the stage of construction, which is the process of regulating the family and governing the country. To govern the country, one must first regulate the family, which is indeed the most suitable approach in this era, because the organization of our society is based on the family as a unit. If every family can practice the New Life Movement, and every family can devote itself to family education, then every family will be forward-looking and full of vigor. Our social atmosphere will naturally not be corrupt and decadent. Therefore, for the sake of one's own happiness and the future of the nation, practicing the New Life Movement is truly the minimum responsibility that everyone should bear.

### The Miao People of a Matriarchal Society

— Cheng Yi

We usually think that the Miao people all live in the remote mountains of the northwest provinces. Recently, a friend who came from the rear told me that the deep mountains of Jingning County, Zhejiang Province, are also inhabited by this ethnic group.

In our imagination, the Miao people must be uncouth, fierce, brave, belligerent, addicted to alcohol, suspicious, and vengeful savages. However, the reality is quite the opposite. The Miao people of Jingning County are extremely gentle, peace-loving, and speak very softly. They live in the deep mountains, and if strangers come to the mountains and shout loudly, they dare not even be seen. When you arrive at their door, you must speak in a low voice and humbly, and then they will dare to invite you to sit down. Once you become familiar with them, they will often make gifts, but they are all crude and inedible. They wear summer cloth all year round, even in the dead of winter, and even the quilts they use are made of several layers of summer cloth. They eat things like sweet potatoes. The mountain land is barren, and there are no rice fields to cultivate, but they are extraordinarily strong, far beyond our abilities. The furniture is simple, very similar to the poorest people in our clan.

The Miao people's system is a matriarchal society, where women's rights are above all else. All financial and labor matters are the responsibility of women; men manage children at home, manage household affairs, and take on chores such as cooking, so men are extremely idle.

There is a female chieftain who wears gold, silver, and jewelry on her head, and wears embroidered clothes. It is said that she was appointed by the Manchu Qing emperor. The Miao people must obey her orders.

Miao people's marriages are extremely free. Every year on a certain day, they gather to sing and dance under the moon. Men and women gather, all wearing red and green clothes, singing and dancing, choosing their own spouses. The man stays at the woman's house for three days and then returns to his own home. If the woman becomes pregnant, the marriage is settled.

The education of the Miao people is now provided by the provincial government, which has established Miao schools and invited Han Chinese to be teachers to educate their children. Their uncivilized life seems to have changed slightly, and civilization can be expected in the near future.

### The Organization of Nurses

— Xue Yi

All members of various groups with the same goals, problems, and needs should organize themselves and formulate policies, rules, and order. Everyone shares the benefits of their duties, and achieves their social goals through appropriate methods. Group activities are very important for nurses, proving that nurses can be responsible for guiding nursing work, without entrusting the responsibility to other groups, or letting it go naturally without intervention. Nurses in all countries of the world have organizations. Our country's national organization, originally named "Chinese Nurses Association," was established in 1912. Although the nursing profession was introduced by Ms. Miet in 1884, Chinese women were not yet liberated at that time, and those who received education did not leave their homes, so progress was not easy. In 1908, nurses from Western countries in various church hospitals began to prepare, but there was not much progress in the first three years. In 1912, the registration methods for nursing schools, standard courses, national meetings, and the issuance of nurses' diplomas were agreed upon, and it was proposed to hold a national nurses' conference in Shanghai in 1914. This conference was indeed realized, thus laying the foundation for the organization of nurses in our country, and in 1922 it joined the International Council of Nurses as a member, equal to nurses from other countries, which invisibly improved the status of our nurses. It is now renamed "Chinese Nursing Association." The work of the group is as follows:

(1) Nursing students, that is, students of nursing schools. When the Nurses Association was established, its purpose was to unify the curriculum and examinations of nursing schools across the country and improve the level of nursing. The work includes: (A) Revising old books at any time to suit modern trends; (B) Holding nurses' exams, and issuing diplomas to those who pass, to show fairness; (C) Handling transfer procedures to prevent students from dropping out halfway; (D) Writing and translating various nursing textbooks for students; (E) Investigating registered schools every two years, and providing instructions on what should be established and reformed at any time; (F) Handling the registration of schools; (G) Opening schools with donations from the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China to open nursing schools in Guiyang, Lanzhou, and Chongqing, which can train more nursing talents to meet the needs of wartime and construction.

(2) Nurses, the outline of the work is to increase the benefits of nurses and connect feelings: (A) Filing the Chinese Nurses Association diploma with the International Council of Nurses so that the Chinese nurses' diploma can be effectively used both domestically and abroad; (B) Convening a national nurses' association at a certain time so that representatives from all over the country have the opportunity to express their opinions; (C) Seeking the equal status of our country's nurses in the international nursing community; (D) Publishing a nurses' quarterly or newsletter so that nurses from all over the country can communicate with each other to publish their personal work experience and all experiences, so that they can benefit each other; (E) Planning the status of nurses in the country and requesting government recognition; (F) Opening nurses' refresher courses for further study; (G) Negotiating with various countries for nursing scholarships so that nurses in our country can study abroad for further study. After the government returns to the capital and various careers are on track, a nursing study abroad examination will be held, and members of the association are qualified to participate; (H) Handling nurses' registration matters; (I) Scholarships are donated from abroad to encourage and comfort the badly injured who serve in the border areas; (J) Providing relief to nurses who are unemployed due to war and finding jobs for them.

(3) To the country and society: (A) Cultivating talents to meet the needs of society, so that patients can get the best care in the institution and recover their health as soon as possible, and at the same time, healthy people can maintain their health, that is, to enable everyone to enter the path of health; (B) So that the entire society can obtain common sense of hygiene and medicine, because nurses are the vanguard of health teachers; (C) To add glory to the country, because our country's nurses already have a place in the international nursing community.

The association has a clubhouse in Nanjing, which was built by donations from nurses. The building is magnificent and the equipment is beautiful. Since the establishment of the association, there have been no less than tens of thousands of members, scattered throughout the country.
