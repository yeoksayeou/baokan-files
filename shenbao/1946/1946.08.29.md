The National Army, occupying one-third of Shaobo, was at a disadvantage fighting with their backs to the water and strategically withdrew, shifting their defense line to the area south of Dazha to Qiaoye. It is reported that the total number of Communist troops continuously moving south from Gaoyou has reached over 10,000, accompanied by over 20,000 militiamen. The Communists may use their old tactic of using militiamen as a vanguard to launch an offensive against Yangzhou. A military strategist told our reporter, "With the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, we would be very happy if the Communists came bearing gifts." It is also learned that the battle for Shaobo lasted four days, with the Communist army rotating troops four times, each time with 2,000 men, resulting in casualties estimated at over 4,000.

There is also fighting near Lao Yezhuang, and National Army reinforcements are moving eastward.

[Our Jiangyin Correspondent, 28th] A Jingjiang dispatch reports that the Communist army has launched an offensive in Rutai in recent days in an attempt to reverse the precarious situation. Small groups of several hundred have appeared between Zhanghuanggang and Xilai'an to intimidate the people. A "bank" has been set up in Sihuigang to absorb materials. The "county governments" of Shanghai, Yu, and Rutai are concentrated in Jingjiang, and are very active. However, according to Staff Officer Xing's observation, the future of public security is guaranteed. Rumors have been confusing people recently, and there is no need for alarm. [Another Telegram] The fighting is fierce on the Huangqiao and Rutai highways in Northern Jiangsu. The sound of cannons can be heard clearly in Southern Jiangsu. The situation in Huangqiao was very tense on the 28th, and the National Army has rushed to reinforce.

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 28th] Sources received a telegram from Datong today stating that the Communist army has encroached upon the area around the airfield, making it difficult to use. Today, sources telegraphed Datong again to inquire about the truth. It is also learned that Fu Zuoyi's troops are advancing westward from Zhuozi Mountain to rescue Datong, and the advance troops reached Sancha Kou, only one stop away from Jining, on the 25th.

[Our Shenyang Correspondent, 27th] (1) In Rehe, the National Army is advancing towards Chengde, and the Communist army has begun to retreat towards Weichang.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] Sources report that the National Army in Rehe has advanced to about 50 li from Chifeng. Zheng Dongguo's troops have set up a command post in Chaoyang, while Zheng has set up a unit in Jinzhou. The strength of the Communist army in Chengde is very strong, but judging from the fact that the Communist army has extensively damaged transportation facilities near Chengde and transported a large amount of materials and equipment out of the city, they seem to lack confidence.

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 28th] Fierce fighting has also broken out on both sides of Nankou on the Pingsui Railway. The National Army is making smooth progress, and the Communist army is reinforcing its troops between Yongzhuang and Longqiao, the vanguard of Zhangjiakou.

Forcibly Drafting People Door-to-Door, Countless Suicides

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 28th] The people near Linqing in Northwestern Shandong have recently been concerned that the rising water level of the Wei River, exacerbated by torrential rains, will cause flooding.

Currently, several sections of the riverbank have been washed away, and the river water is flowing eastward, turning Enxian and Xiajin into a swamp.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 28th] In Linqing, Guanxian, and Qiuxian in Southwestern Shandong, the Communist army has recently imposed martial law, cutting off pedestrian traffic, and forcibly drafting men between the ages of fifteen and fifty from door to door.

### Anping Incident Team Resumes Investigation Work

The 25-member team responsible for investigating the Anping Incident, whose work has been stalled for a long time, has now decided to resume its investigation work starting on the 29th. This was decided at a meeting of the three members of the Military Mediation Department on the morning of the 28th. The team will leave Beiping at 7:00 AM on the 29th and return to Anping Town to continue its unfinished work.

According to the testimony of Cao Yuting, a resident of Anping Town, the Communist army captured two American soldiers. According to official sources, this is indeed the case. However, the two American soldiers were released by the Communist army after driving their vehicle to the west bank of the Grand Canal. They were initially listed as missing, but they did not report the details to their superiors after being released, so very few people know about it.

### Flying Coal Prices in Beiping

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 28th] Coal prices in Beiping have soared recently. On the black market, coal lumps have risen to 150,000 yuan per ton, and coal powder has risen to 4,000 yuan per 100 jin. This soaring phenomenon is caused by poor supply and hoarding by merchants. It is learned that the heavy rains two months ago flooded most of the coal kilns in Mentougou, resulting in a daily output of only 200 tons, a decrease of four-fifths compared to the normal output. The Weihe Bridge on the Shanxi Bingjing coal mine was destroyed, and the Yangquan coal was also blocked due to the Zhengtai Road. Although the coal was piled up like a mountain, there was no way to transport it out. In addition, the rear service department's storage of coal in Beiping may also be one of the reasons.

### Hebei High Court Schedules Public Trial of Traitor Wang Yitang Tomorrow

### Cheng Qian Scheduled to Return to Hankou Tomorrow, Reportedly Disaster Relief Being Hastened in Hubei Province, Treatment of Officers and Soldiers to be Improved Next Month

[Our Guling Correspondent, 28th] Cheng Qian, Director of the Wuhan Provisional Headquarters, received reporters at 3:00 PM on the 28th and reported on the western escape of the Communist army led by Li Xiannian and the suffering of the people in Northern Hubei and Southern Henan. After the report, reporters asked if Li Xiannian's troops had any possibility of escaping west. Cheng replied that the Communist army in the mountains between Zhushan and Zhuxi in Sichuan and Hubei now numbered only over 1,000. They have been blocked by the National Army and there is no possibility of them escaping again. A reporter asked if the remnants of the Communist army, if unable to escape again, could establish a new base in the mountains of Zhushan and Zhuxi. Cheng replied that they could not. During the Jiaqing period, bandits occupied the area and harassed it in all directions. At that time, transportation was inconvenient and troop movements were difficult, so that kind of phenomenon occurred. Now, transportation is convenient and it is difficult to occupy the area. Our reporter asked about the organization of the Provisional Headquarters and the treatment of officers and soldiers. Cheng replied that the new treatment will be implemented starting in September, and the lives of officers and soldiers are expected to improve. Asked why Li Xiannian's troops failed this time, Cheng replied that this was a meaningful question. The reason for the failure of the Communist army was that they harassed the people, so most of them escaped voluntarily, while the National Army did not need the local authorities to be responsible for anything. The reason for success or failure lies in this. Director Cheng will meet with the Chairman on the 29th and return to Hankou on the 30th.

[Central News Agency, Guling, 28th] General Cheng Qian said that all the National Army in the Wuhan Provisional Headquarters jurisdiction had been reorganized as planned by the Central Government. Li Xiannian's troops did not abide by the peaceful agreement and started a riot on June 27th of this year. After two months, countless people were killed, and the people in the border area of Hubei and Henan issued the most tragic cries for help. Later, troops were mobilized to effectively stop them, and the people's armed forces in various counties also rose up to defend themselves. Li's troops have all collapsed. Emergency relief has been stepped up in the areas most severely affected by the Communist army's disturbances. The Chairman has issued the remaining items seized from the enemy and puppets, as well as the food, old clothes, and other supplies from the various stations, to the disaster-stricken counties.

### Communist Army Intensifies Destruction of Railways, Coal Cars Derailed on the Beining Railway

Accidents Occur on the Jinpu, Pinggu and Other Lines

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 28th] Sources in the transportation industry report that as the war expands, the Communist army seems to be intensifying its destruction of railways. Last night and this morning, accidents occurred on the Beining, Jinpu, Pinggu, and other lines. The roadbeds between Tianzhuang Caizhuang south of Tangshan on the Beining Railway and between Chadian and Hangu were severely damaged. Eight coal cars from Tangshan South derailed as a result, and an armored train also derailed. At the same time, more than 300 Communist troops attacked Tianzhuang, and more than 3,000 Communist troops gathered near Tangfang Station to the north, seemingly intending to destroy the road and attack Qigang. Machang on the Jinpu Railway was again fiercely attacked by more than 1,000 Communist troops this morning, and there have been no reports since. Anci County on the Pingjin Road was fiercely attacked by the Communist army last night, and the situation is unclear since then. Two companies of the National Army in Xiancha, 18 li southeast of Huairou on the Pinggu Road, were also surrounded by the Communist army last night, and fierce fighting continued until 9:00 AM this morning.

[Central News Agency, Shijiazhuang, 28th] The railway between Niangziguan and Yangquan on the Shitai Railway, which was destroyed by the Communist army, has been completely repaired since the Railway Bureau ordered workers to rush to repair it day and night. It was originally scheduled to test the train on the 28th, but on the morning of the 27th, the Communist army east of Niangziguan destroyed a bridge at 24 kilometers and 700 meters between Jingxing and Nanyu, and blew up a mountain cave 80 meters long at 65 kilometers. The passenger train that departed from Shijiazhuang on the morning of the 28th turned back at Jingxing.

### US Envoy Meets Zhou Enlai, Exchanges Views on the National Government Committee Issue

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 27th] After returning to Nanjing on the 27th, Special Envoy Marshall had a long talk with Ambassador Stuart, conveying the opinions exchanged with Chairman Chiang in Guling 　 Ambassador's reference for talks with Zhou Enlai. At 4:00 PM on the 28th, Zhou Enlai visited the ambassador and talked for an hour and a half. It is learned that the government side is 　 considering the opinions of Marshall and the Mediation Department and is first discussing the issue of the National Government Committee. Regarding the allocation of seats, the government's opinion is that the Kuomintang should occupy 　 seats, the Communist Party should occupy eight seats, and the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and social figures should each occupy four seats. However, it is heard that the Communist Party originally insisted on ten seats and occupied fourteen of the forty seats, which is enough to retain one-third of the veto power. The ambassador conveyed this idea to Zhou when meeting with Zhou, as a basis for continued discussions. According to the spokesman of the Communist Party delegation on the evening of the 28th, today 　 　 exchanged views on general issues only. It was also said that the government side did not give a concrete reply to the two opinions previously raised by Zhou, and that the issue of the National Government 　 　 Committee could not be discussed at present, and that it has now fallen back into a "delaying situation."

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] Envoy Ma met with Yu Dawei on the morning of the 28th for about an hour and scheduled to meet Zhou Enlai on the 29th.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] It is said here that British Ambassador Shi 　 Wen, British Prime Minister's Military Representative General Wyatt, and Canadian Ambassador Brigadier General Odren will participate in 　 　 work and strive for peace in China. However, when reporters inquired about the above rumors from relevant authorities, they all failed to confirm them. The British 　 authority strongly denied this statement when receiving reporters on the 28th. He believed that the British ambassador had not been in China for a long time and did not know the Chinese situation very well 　, so he would not participate in this mediation work. It is true that Wyatt and Odren have met with Chairman Chiang many times, but to take on mediation work 　 , the above rumors may have been caused by this suggestion. He also believes that if there is hope for peace in China, then the mediation of Marshal Ma and Ambassador 　 is sufficient, and there is no need to bring in any other third party. (Please read the second 　 for the news of Special Envoy Ma discussing the issue of handling US surplus materials with the US Undersecretary of Commerce.)

### At Foreign Reporters Reception, Minister Peng Talked Freely About the Overall Situation, The Communist Party Only Needs to Shift Its Mind to Immediately Achieve Peace

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The Propaganda Department of the Communist Party held a reception for foreign reporters at 3:30 PM on the 28th, hosted by Minister Peng Xuepei and Vice Minister Liu Kai of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The main points of the conversation are recorded below:

Expanding the Foundation of Government

Q: Minister, what is the hope of success for the new suggestion of Marshall and Ambassador 　 to reorganize the National Government Committee to include Communist Party members? Will the National Government Committee replace the Supreme National Defense Council?

Minister Peng replied: Expanding the foundation of the government to include various parties and non-party members has been announced by Chairman Chiang on August 14. The National Government Committee will replace the Supreme National Defense Council, but this matter must be realized in an atmosphere of harmony and requires the active cooperation of the Communist Party, and not using negotiations as a tool for delay.

Q: Does the Minister believe that the reorganization of the Government Committee can lead to lasting peace?

Minister Peng replied: The government will spare no effort to lay the foundation for permanent peace. If the National Government Committee can be reorganized, it will be a step forward to achieve this goal.

Needs, Not Conditions

Q: Can the government be expected to withdraw or reduce its five conditions?

Minister Peng replied: The so-called conditions are only the various needs to restore public order after the new situation caused by the Communist Party's attacks and expansion of territory. These needs cannot be regarded as the government's conditions or requirements. For example, the Communist army recently launched a large-scale offensive by sea and land, occupying many important cities. Under this situation, the retreat of the Communist army to restore the order of Changdi is a need. However, the Communist Party 　 has again promoted it as a new condition or requirement of the government.

Ceasefire Must Be Sincere

Q: What are your views on the Communist Party's written announcement requesting a comprehensive ceasefire and the reopening of the Political Consultative Conference?

Minister Peng replied: (1) Regarding the comprehensive ceasefire, since the ceasefire order was issued in January, the government has not issued an attack order. In recent months, only the Communist Party has not complied with the agreement, has not respected mediation, and has launched attacks everywhere, expanding the occupied areas, causing chaos to spread. This can be proven by comparing the areas occupied by the Communist army today with the situation when the ceasefire order was issued in January. By observing the full mobilization order recently officially published by the Communist Party, it is even clearer who the attacker is. It is wrong to say that there is no ceasefire. Therefore, the key to stopping the conflict today lies in whether the Communist Party is sincere, whether it is willing to withdraw its full mobilization order, and to withdraw from some areas that have constituted a threat to peace or hindered transportation. The Communist Party only needs to shift its mind to immediately achieve peace, and propaganda cannot cover the ears and eyes of the people of the world.

Striving to Implement Resolutions

(2) Regarding the reopening of the Political Consultative Conference, the Political Consultative Conference has made detailed resolutions on various issues, not only in principle, but also in terms of plans and steps. The current problem lies in implementing what has already been resolved. Chairman Jiang's statement on August 14 clearly stated the government's policy. The government is now making every effort to implement the Political Consultative Conference resolutions. Therefore, the current problem lies in sincere implementation, not in indefinite discussions. (3) Regarding the expansion of the government, the August 14 statement clearly stated that the expansion of the government foundation must be realized as soon as possible. This means that the reorganization of the National Government should be completed in accordance with the original plan before the National Assembly is held. Once this is realized, it will be difficult for the various parties to resolve various issues within the government in a spirit of harmony. (4) Regarding the draft constitution, the August 14 statement contained the phrase "gather better opinions from all parties" regarding the draft constitution. This point was already stated verbally at the close of the Political Consultative Conference. The exchange of opinions in the Draft Constitution Review Committee is also based on this spirit.

Promoting the Convening of the National Assembly

(5) Regarding the end of political tutelage, the government is eager to end political tutelage and implement a constitutional government. This determination has been declared repeatedly and efforts have been made in practice. It is hoped that certain parties will not misunderstand and distort the importance of the country over the party. The parties should work together with sincerity to promote the convening of the National Assembly, so that the two major goals of democracy and peace can be achieved.

### U.S. Assistant Secretary of War Patterson Arrives in Beijing at Invitation, Discusses Remaining Supplies with Marshall and Lucas, Acheson Denies Using Military Aircraft to Transfer to Our Government

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] Special Envoy Marshall, U.S. Assistant Secretary of War Patterson, and U.S. Military Advisory Group Leader Lucas held talks at the U.S. Military Headquarters here this afternoon, the 28th, lasting approximately one hour. It is reported that the discussions were related to the handling of remaining supplies and other issues. Mr. Patterson is scheduled to leave Beijing on the evening of the 28th.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] Special Envoy Marshall received U.S. Assistant Secretary of War Mr. Patterson this morning, the 28th, and held discussions. Mr. Patterson flew from Shanghai to Beijing this morning, the 28th, at the invitation of Special Envoy Marshall.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] Marshal Marshall visited Ambassador Stuart at 3 PM this afternoon, the 28th, and spoke for quite some time. It is said that the content of the conversation likely pertained to the U.S. remaining supplies issue.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th Dispatch] Acting U.S. Secretary of State Acheson told reporters that the rumor in Shanghai that the Foreign Liquidation Commission had handed over ten (B-25) aircraft to the Chinese government was considered untrue. The State Department has ordered the Foreign Liquidation Commission to investigate the responsibility for transferring remaining supplies to China in violation of regulations. He stated that the United States has transferred combat supplies to many countries with the approval of the State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but this measure has been discontinued for China.

### Mitchell Bombers, Eleven Deemed Scrap Metal, Dismantled by U.S. Military Personnel at Jiangwan Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] Amidst recent widespread rumors of the Shanghai office of the U.S. Foreign Liquidation Commission illegally selling bombers, U.S. Army personnel stationed at Jiangwan Airfield suddenly dismantled eleven B-25 Mitchell bombers of the type originally sold to the Central Air Transport Corporation yesterday morning. Chen Wenkuan, Director of the Flight Operations Department of the Central Air Transport Corporation, after personally inspecting Jiangwan Airfield, told reporters: "These bombers were originally unable to fly. U.S. personnel, to ensure that they could not fly, cut them in two with electric torches on the morning of the 28th, severing them completely. However, the components, radios, instruments, etc. inside the aircraft, as specified in the contract, are still complete and usable, and our company will send personnel to dismantle them gradually, while the scrap aircraft can still be used as scrap metal."

To clarify the truth about the aircraft purchase and demonstrate that the purchased aircraft were no longer suitable for military purposes, the Central Air Transport Corporation originally planned to invite reporters from various newspapers to Jiangwan for on-site observation at 10:00 AM yesterday. However, when more than ten reporters arrived in a Central Air Transport Corporation truck, they were suddenly stopped by the military police guarding the airfield and not allowed to enter. The reason given was "urgent orders had been received." According to the explanation of Director Chen Wenkuan, this misunderstanding was due to insufficient prior communication. Chen's original intention was to gather reporters from various newspaper offices in the city and take them to Longhua, from where they would fly to Jiangwan by plane to avoid the heavily guarded U.S. military police at the entrance, who were unaware of the situation, from stopping them abruptly. However, the truck driver mistakenly took the reporters directly to Jiangwan, so they were still blocked outside the airfield. After learning of this in the afternoon, Chen Wenkuan immediately flew to Jiangwan Airfield himself and negotiated via radio. After obtaining permission, he landed and inspected the site. According to Chen's inquiry, the U.S. military security officer in charge stated that they were in fact very willing for reporters to visit, and that the previous situation was a misunderstanding on the part of the guards at the gate. What Chen saw at the time was a pile of bomber wreckage.

### McBride Statement

[U.S. Information Service, This City News] U.S. Foreign Liquidation Commissioner McBride issued the following statement today regarding the U.S. sale of surplus aircraft to the Central Air Transport Corporation: "The B-25 Mitchell bombers included in the Liquidation Commission's sale to the Central Air Transport Corporation were sold as scrap and can only be used for parts. The contract between the Central Air Transport Corporation and the Liquidation Commission specifically included this agreement. Furthermore, officials from the Central Air Transport Corporation reiterated their view yesterday that they will comply with this agreement and that steps to dismantle these aircraft, rendering them scrap metal, have been implemented. The aircraft are no longer suitable for flight. The Liquidation Commission will closely monitor whether the conditions of the contract are fully implemented."

### Executive Yuan Orders Provinces and Cities to Abolish National Guard Corps

It would require psychological construction as well as economic and material construction to achieve stability in the lives of the citizens. The Nanjing I envision is similar to Washington, D.C., not like New York City.

### Xiao Zheng Proposes to the Central Government to Implement Land Reform with "Land to the Tiller" as the Principle

[Our Dispatch] Xiao Zheng, Chairman of the Chinese Land Administration Society, recently proposed to the central government the implementation of land reform to permanently consolidate unification and achieve genuine democracy. This reform is based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principle of "land to the tiller" as its basic spirit. The main points are as follows: (1) In the future, when agricultural land is transferred (through sale, donation, inheritance, etc.), the "acquiring party" (i.e., the buyer, donee, or heir) must cultivate the land themselves as a necessary condition. Otherwise, the government or self-cultivating farmers have the right of first refusal to purchase, and land financial institutions may lend funds to purchase the land; (2) For all non-self-cultivated land, the government may, in accordance with the provisions of the Land Law, implement requisition by district, compensating for the price of the land, and reorganize this requisitioned land into standard farms, which will be issued to the original cultivators with priority or to other farmers willing to cultivate the land themselves; (3) All land requisitioned and redistributed to farmers by the government should be organized into cooperative farms; (4) In pacification areas where land boundaries have not been destroyed and land rights have not undergone major changes, the original landowners may legally retain their property rights, but they may not collect rent or other demands. To realize the "land to the tiller" policy, the government may requisition this land and redistribute it to the original cultivators; (5) In pacification areas where land boundaries have been destroyed or land rights have been illegally distributed, if the original owners can provide proof of ownership and are not self-cultivating farmers, the current cultivators may continue to cultivate their land and should apply to the local land administration agency to purchase it. The purchase price will be fairly assessed by the government and paid by the cultivators over 15 to 20 years in agricultural products; (6) In pacification areas where land boundaries have been destroyed or land rights have been distributed, if the original owners can provide proof and request to reclaim the land for self-cultivation, it should be returned to them, and the value of the crops or other improvements should be assessed and compensated by the original owners to the current cultivators. This land may not be leased again, otherwise it may be confiscated; (7) In pacification areas, farmers who have no land to cultivate after land rights have been sorted out may apply to the government for land allocation, pay the land price in installments in agricultural products, and then obtain ownership of the land; (8) Ownerless and public land in pacification areas should be allocated by the government to farmers for cultivation; (9) When implementing land reform, it is necessary to simultaneously implement rural autonomy, with county and township autonomous organizations responsible for execution and supervision. In other words, to use land reform to enable farmers to actually participate in politics, and to use this as the foundation for true democracy and permanent unification of the country.

### Ministry of Food Plans to Establish Ever-Normal Granaries to Stabilize Grain Prices

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] In order to control grain prices and regulate supply and demand, the Ministry of Food plans to establish ever-normal granaries in major cities after the autumn harvest this year.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] Qiao Qiming, Director of the Agricultural Loan Office of the Agricultural Bank of China, stated that this year's harvest has been plentiful in various regions, and grain prices have fallen. If farmers sell rice and grain in large quantities at this time, they will inevitably suffer losses. Branches and offices of the Agricultural Bank of China in various regions have been ordered to handle rice and grain loans. If farmers need to turn around funds, they can deposit their grain in the bank's agricultural warehouses, borrowing 50% to 70% of the current market value, with a monthly interest rate of 0.3%.

Seabed Accumulation Allows Walking Across the River

Two passengers got on the car and said that they had walked from the opposite bank of Sanchedai after lunch, only taking a Sanban boat for about half a mile in the middle.

Walking across the Qiantang River from Sanchedai has never been heard of before, which shows one aspect of the collapse of the Qiantang seawall and seabed accumulation.

Editorial

### Will the United States Change Its China Policy?

The United States' sale of surplus materials to China has surprisingly provoked clamor and protest from the Chinese Communists (中共), who claim that these surplus materials "include American military weapons, ammunition, wireless communications equipment, and other equipment stockpiled in places like Okinawa and the Philippines." This kind of fabricated "beautiful lie" is not worth arguing over in the first place; however, the United States is a democratic country and must issue a statement to deny it. The statements issued yesterday by U.S. Army General Peterson and State Department Foreign Clearance Commissioner McCabe have completely dispelled the doubts surrounding this issue. They solemnly declared that there are absolutely no military weapons, firearms, aircraft, or other military supplies in the materials sold to the Chinese government; and that these surplus materials are purely for civilian use and will be of great benefit to China's recovery and peacetime economy. After hearing this stern statement, what else can the Chinese Communists say?

The post-war international policy of the United States is clearly based on two major foundations: first, the occupation of Germany and Japan to eliminate the remnants of fascism, so that their aggressive forces can no longer rise again; second, the support of the United Nations organization, to make it an effective tool for maintaining world peace, and the willingness to assist countries that faithfully fulfill the obligations stipulated in the United Nations Charter. Logically, the United States should no longer sell armaments to other countries after the end of the war, but the United States, based on the above reasons, still sells armaments to Britain, France, China, the Philippines, and some Latin American countries. Accordingly, even if there are armaments and ammunition in these surplus materials sold to China, it does not conflict with the keynote of American international policy. The clamor and protests of the Chinese Communists will not sway the United States' China policy. Therefore, U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson said yesterday in a diplomatic tone: "Whether the current U.S. China policy will change? It is not possible to announce at this time."

In the U.S. State Department, there are many diplomats with long-term vision. All policies and plans are decided after careful study. In the process of implementing policies, no matter what difficulties and obstacles are encountered, they only redouble their efforts to adhere to their original intentions and rarely change course when faced with difficulties. Taking its China policy as an example, there has been no change since President Truman issued a statement in December last year. Whether it is sending special envoy Marshall to China to mediate the disputes between the Kuomintang and the Communists, or appointing Stuart as the ambassador to China, the consistent policy of the United States is to hope that China will become a unified, democratic, and strong country, and can be the only stabilizing force in the Far East? And do more to maintain peace in the Far East. Therefore, the true intention of the United States in selling surplus materials in the Western Pacific to China is to help China's recovery. However, the Chinese Communists, with ulterior motives, believe that the United States has other intentions, and launch a propaganda offensive, inciting people everywhere to oppose the United States. Fortunately, the eyes of the Chinese people are discerning, and they can clearly distinguish between good and evil, truth and falsehood, right and wrong, black and white, as well as benefits and harms, gains and losses. Therefore, standing from the standpoint of the people, we once again advise the American government and the public that the Chinese Communists' clamor against the United States is definitely not the public opinion of our 450 million people; and that the people across the country are only sincerely grateful for the United States' sale of surplus materials to China to help our country's recovery and nation-building, and hope that this matter will be completed as soon as possible. How can there be any reason to oppose it!

The Turmoil in the Islamic World

In today's situation, where the situation in Europe is turbulent and uneasy, and relations between the great powers are repeatedly strained, there is also a brewing storm in the Near East. The issue of the Dardanelles Strait has just been raised, and the Ukrainian representative has accused Greece of endangering peace in the Balkans. Relations between the United States and South America have been on the verge of explosion due to the United States' proposal of the "Act of Chapultepec." Now, this series of European problems has not yet been resolved, and new developments are emerging in the Near East. Although we do not need to speculate on how these new developments will unfold in the future, the news coming from the Near East is quite worrying. A broadcast from San Francisco on the 28th said that civil war in Iran is likely to break out within two weeks, and negotiations between the government and Azerbaijan have reached a deadlock. From the Middle East to the Near East to the Far East, the entire region is not a land of peace; from Egypt to India, it is filled with the smell of gunpowder, and there are religious struggles and Anglo-Soviet conflicts everywhere. In northern Iran, Soviet troops are concentrated, while British troops have occupied the southern border, with their fleets cruising or anchoring in the Persian Gulf. At the same time, the Kurds of Iraq are negotiating with the Soviets to establish a Kurdish state, in an attempt to open up the Near East corridor and connect to Basra in the Middle East through Turkey's Dardanelles.

At this time, the British government announced that it would hold a meeting in London on September 9 with Arab and Jewish representatives to discuss the Palestine issue. The British Foreign Office announced that invitations had been sent to the governments of Arab countries, the Jewish Agency for Palestine, and the Arab Higher Committee of Palestine. Although this meeting is to discuss the Palestine issue, the fact that all Arab countries have been invited undoubtedly allows for incidental discussion of the situation in the Near East. What is noteworthy here is that, according to a United Press dispatch, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem had colluded with Hitler during the war and was detested by the British. British officials had previously publicly stated that they were unwilling to invite him to participate; however, the Arab Higher Committee of Palestine believed that the committee's chairman, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin El Husseini, should be one of the representatives, and this prerequisite remains in effect. The so-called Grand Mufti is a title in Islam. This person, Haj Amin El Husseini, had echoed the British army in the First World War, launching the Arab nationalist movement against Turkey. However, in the Second World War, he was against the British. Now, at a time of turmoil in the Arab world in the Near East, it may be necessary to have someone like the Grand Mufti to support Britain's attempt to stabilize the Near East, especially since he made a considerable contribution to Britain in the First World War.

From the above description, it is not difficult for us to see how turbulent the situation in the Near East is. The state-building movements of Azerbaijan and the Kurds need to negotiate with the Soviet Union, and it goes without saying that they are backed by Moscow. Since it supports the Kurds, it will inevitably weaken Iraq, which is centered on the Arab people; and Iraq gained independence under the support of Britain. At this time, the invitation for representatives of Arab countries to gather in London will enhance the relationship between Arab countries and Britain. From this, it can be seen how Britain and the Soviet Union are engaging in intrigue, using their wisdom and means to enhance their respective positions in the Islamic world of the Near East. This struggle is not limited to the Near East. Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Greece, and Yugoslavia are all interconnected.

In the past, Mussolini once styled himself as the "Protector of Islam;" Hitler also did not forget the Arabs living in the rich oil regions, and sent his Deputy Prime Minister von Papen as ambassador to Turkey in order to establish closer relations with the Arabs in the Islamic world. Now, both Mussolini and Hitler have been defeated; however, the Arab countries in the Islamic world of the Near East still have rich oil fields, and there are many Islamic national republics affiliated with the Soviet Union in Soviet Central Asia. What will happen to the Islamic world, from India to North Africa, in the future is really worthy of our attention.

In India, because the Muslim League led by Jinnah refused to participate in the interim government led by Nehru, the attitude of the Muslim League and the development of the situation in India will be of concern to those who care about the situation in India. In Iran, the situation has been tense for quite some time, and the problem has not yet been resolved; in Iraq, there is the Kurdish state-building movement; in Turkey, there is the issue of the Dardanelles Strait; in North Africa, there is the issue of the transfer of former Italian territories; and even in Tunisia, there is unrest among the so-called "Pan-Arab" activists. The entire Islamic world is in turmoil, and in this turmoil, we see reports of civil war in Iran breaking out within two weeks, and reports of Britain convening a conference in London and issuing invitations to Arab countries. Putting these events together, we can see the subtle and complex international relations behind them. In the Islamic world, we see a head-on collision between the interests of the so-called "Western European bloc" and the interests of the "anti-Western European bloc." Only when the turbulent Islamic world can be stabilized can the entire world be stabilized.

### Tianjin Military Reception Personnel Liu Naiyi Arrested for Corruption: Concealing Over 1 Billion Yuan in Japanese Gold and Cash, Numerous Pearls and Gold Treasures Found in Residence

[Report from Tianjin by this newspaper on the 28th] The main culprit in the major corruption case involving military reception personnel uncovered in Tianjin by the investigation team, Liu Naiyi, Naval Captain and Director of the North China Naval Commissioner's Office, was arrested on the 27th. It is reported that the investigation team had received secret reports in peacetime, stating that Liu had concealed 2,000 taels of gold and 100 million yuan in cash belonging to a Japanese resident named Osasa, and embezzled other materials. It is estimated that the total amount is close to 1 billion yuan. When the team arrived in Tianjin to listen to the reception reports from various units, Liu left Tianjin for Beiping, but later returned to Tianjin. After extensive investigation of this case, the investigation team determined that Liu was indeed suspected of major corruption. On the 26th, they sent a letter to the Beiping Executive Headquarters, and with the instructions of Director Li, senior staff officer Lu Jiqing of the Executive Headquarters in Tianjin consulted with the team to handle the matter. On the 27th, with the cooperation of the military, police, and gendarmes, the investigation team first arrested and detained Liu Naiyi, and divided into four groups to start an investigation at his residence at 118 Dihua Road and two other houses and offices. At that time, more than 500 pearls, 17 gold ingots, 8 pairs of gold bracelets, and more than 50 leather jackets were found in his residence. There were also several safes that had not yet been opened. The investigation was temporarily suspended at about 1:00 AM on the 28th, and three groups continued the investigation after 8:00 AM. As of the time of sending the telegram, the investigation had not yet been completed. The suspect Liu was transferred to Beiping on the afternoon of the 28th, or will be transferred to the Ministry of National Defense in Nanjing for trial. It is reported that the Japanese resident Xiao Sa, who owned the gold, had already been repatriated back to his country.

[Report from Beiping by this newspaper on the 28th] The investigation team uncovered two cases of police station corruption and dereliction of duty in Beiping. According to investigation, the Outer Second District Police Station of the Beiping Police Bureau had forged guarantees and illegally transferred enemy and puppet grain. Wu Qian, the director of the Southern Suburbs Police Station, had abused his power and used the name of investigating the property of traitors to privately accept gold, silver, jade, antiques, and other items, and had continuously defrauded a total of more than 14 million yuan, both attempted and completed. Both cases have been investigated by the investigation team, and there is solid evidence.

### Accelerate the Work of the Paris Peace Conference: The Four Foreign Ministers Will Meet Today; Belgian Foreign Minister Returned to Paris from London Yesterday

[Comprehensive news from this newspaper] Paris, 28th broadcast: Tomorrow at 4:00 PM, the foreign ministers of the four major powers, the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France: Byrnes, Molotov, Bevin, and Bidault, will hold consultations on the current situation of the peace conference. France responded to the invitation from the United States and Britain this morning by inviting the three powers to a meeting at the French Foreign Ministry. The Soviet Union's response was submitted on Tuesday. The nature of the meeting is "informal." Whether there will be similar gatherings in the future will be decided by the four foreign ministers.

London, 28th broadcast: British Foreign Minister Bevin arrived in Paris this afternoon to arrange the meeting of the four foreign ministers. The convening of this meeting was initiated by the British side. The meeting will be held at the British Embassy or the French Foreign Ministry. According to a United Press dispatch, the meeting of the four foreign ministers was convened at the request of the Canadian Prime Minister by British Foreign Minister Bevin to U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes.

According to a United Press dispatch from Paris on the 28th, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has accepted the proposal to convene a meeting of the four foreign ministers, but stipulates that this meeting is of an informal nature, and each foreign minister may only bring two experts. It is recalled that when the last meeting of the four foreign ministers was held, this relatively tight method was used, and a compromise solution was reached on the Trieste issue. This meeting is not open to the press, but due to Byrnes' insistence, it was decided that all resolutions would be published immediately afterwards.

### Review of the Draft Treaty with Italy: The Peace Conference Achieved Concrete Progress; Several Regions on the Italian Border Were Ceded to France

[United Press, Paris, 28th] Today, the peace conference made its first concrete progress in a month in reviewing the peace treaty. The Political Committee on Italy unanimously passed the first section of the peace treaty with Italy, ceding the Saint-Bernard Pass in the Alps to France. Italy also agreed to this. Italian representative Saragat claimed that Italy had formally agreed to cede four small border areas to France, including Tenda and Briga. However, regarding the high ground of Cenis, he requested that the conference amend the decision of the four powers.

[French News Agency, Paris, 28th] The head of the Italian delegation, Saragat, stated his views at the peace conference today, saying that Italy and the United Nations fought together for two years, which can offset their past mistakes. Italy is making every effort to restore friendship with France, but according to the draft peace treaty, revising the French-Italian border will cause Italy to lose Mount Cenis, Mount Chaberton, and the Roia Valley, which is unreasonable from an economic and ethnic point of view. Saragat left the meeting after finishing his speech.

### Australian Representative Withdraws: Recommendation to Establish Two Committees

[United Press, Paris, 28th] Today, the United States, France, Britain, and the Soviet Union adopted the same position, opposing Australia's proposal to establish a compensation committee and a special review committee for territorial changes. However, the three countries reprimanded the Soviet delegation for attacking the Australian delegation and questioning the motives of the Australian delegation. In view of the inevitable failure of the above proposals, the Australian representative withdrew them. Therefore, the four-power agreement on compensation and territorial changes remains in its original form in the draft treaty. However, the Australian delegation reserves the right to inquire in the future how much each former enemy country will compensate in total.

### Political Committee on Romania: Passed the Preamble to the Treaty

[French News Agency, Paris, 27th] The Political Committee on Romania of the peace conference met today and passed the preamble to the draft treaty with Romania. Except for an amendment proposed by the Australian representative stipulating that "the principles of honesty and fairness will be the basis of this treaty," there were no other changes. As for the second part of the amendment proposed by the Australian representative, which is about guaranteeing the rights of minorities, it was decided to reserve it for future discussion. A memorandum submitted by Romania, proposing to change the date of the country's entry into the war from September 12 to August 24, was rejected. The Ukrainian representative proposed an amendment, advocating that Romania be recognized as a co-belligerent and demanding that the treaty explicitly state that the country had fought against Germany and Hungary. This request was supported by the Czech representative, but both proposals were rejected.

[Reuters, Johannesburg, 27th] At the UN General Assembly, South African Prime Minister Smuts will request that the mandated territory of Southwest Africa be merged into the Union of South Africa. The compelling evidence he will present will be the results of the vote by the residents of Southwest Africa in favor of the merger. It is reported that since March of this year, the South African authorities have sent people deep into various parts of Southwest Africa, asking the natives to answer the question of "whether they support merging with South Africa." The natives did not understand the meaning of this move and thought they were changing another type of ID card, so they rashly expressed their support and affixed their fingerprints. The Southwest Legislative Assembly recently formally passed the merger with South Africa. These two results will undoubtedly be powerful documents to support Smuts' request. The British government's attitude is that if the local residents do support the merger, then Britain will support Smuts' request at the UN General Assembly.

### Amid the Unease and Instability in the Balkans, the U.S. Fleet Will Visit Greece, Stationed in the Aegean Sea overlooking Turkey, and the Soviet Ambassador to Greece Was Suddenly Recalled

[Comprehensive news from this newspaper] According to Reuters, Washington, the U.S. aircraft carrier "Roosevelt" will make a courtesy visit to the port of Piraeus in Greece from September 5 to 9, accompanied by the 10,000-ton cruiser "Little Rock," the destroyer "Cone," and the "Corry." At the same time, the U.S. destroyers "Noah" and "Warrington" will visit Thessaloniki. The commander of the U.S. Navy visiting Greek seaports is Rear Admiral Cassedy, commander of the carrier fleet of the Atlantic Fleet. The "Roosevelt" arrived in Naples today. According to United Press, the United States has decided to send a fleet to visit Greece, which is now the focus of a new Soviet diplomatic offensive. This display of naval power is still officially called a "courtesy visit," but diplomatic circles believe that this U.S. fleet will be stationed in the Aegean Sea, overlooking Turkey, and also making the population of the Dardanelles Strait, which the Soviet Union covets and jointly protects, just a shot away. This move also closely follows Ukraine's accusation in the UN Security Council that Greece is a danger to Balkan peace, and its significance is even more obvious.

According to United Press, Athens, the Soviet Ambassador to Greece, Rodionov, requested the Greek government to issue a passport on the 28th so that he could return to his country with his family. According to diplomatic circles, this move was at the government's request. Greek officials also attach great importance to this request, as it occurred on the eve of Sunday's referendum on the empire. Other parties frankly announced that Rodionov's request is part of the pressure exerted by the Soviet bloc on Greece, and it is also a prelude to the Soviet Union's possible non-recognition of the Greek imperial government that will be produced by Sunday's referendum.

[Our Own Dispatch] Paris, 28th (Broadcast from London): A heated debate has erupted within the Jewish Association regarding participation in the London Conference, and a resolution is expected soon. According to London newspapers, the British Colonial Office may invite the World Jewish Organization "Agudath Israel" to attend the conference, an organization opposed to Jewish nationalism. A Colonial Office spokesperson declared this morning that "Agudath Israel" is in contact with the department regarding the issue of representatives attending the conference, but it seems that the only unresolved matter concerns the specific individuals involved.

[Another Dispatch]: The Palestine Conference will be convened in London's Lancaster House starting September 9. Whether the conference proceedings will be open or closed has yet to be decided, but it seems certain that the representatives of the Arab and Jewish sides will be seated separately. The British Foreign Office believes there is little possibility of journalists being allowed to attend the conference debates. The British side will act as an intermediary between the Arab and Jewish sides. It is not yet known whether the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem will personally attend the conference. The Foreign Office hinted that Azzam Pasha will be invited to attend in his personal capacity as Secretary-General of the Arab League.

### Doihara Secretly Planned Everything, Abducting Puyi to the Northeast, Prosecutors Presented Relevant Documents Yesterday, Gear Described the Japanese Army's Drug Operations in Shanghai, Manager of Pudong Electricity Company Also to be Summoned as Witness

[Gōdō News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] Today, the prosecutors at the International Tribunal presented documents related to Puyi's schemes. On November 3, 1931, the Consul-General in Tianjin, Kuwashima, sent a telegram to Foreign Minister Shidehara, reporting on a conversation with Doihara, stating that Doihara met with Puyi on the night of the 2nd and informed him that the Kwantung Army had decided to support Puyi as Emperor, forming a defensive alliance with Japan, and that the Japanese Imperial Family also welcomed the revival of the Qing Dynasty. Puyi seemed quite moved. On November 13, the Consul in Niuzhuang, Arakawa, sent a confidential telegram to Foreign Minister Shidehara, stating: "According to the captain of the Awaji Maru, Doihara secretly transported Puyi from the concession in Tianjin to the dock by car, guarded by soldiers carrying machine guns. He boarded a speedboat and headed to Dagu, then transferred to the Awaji Maru." On November 17, Kuwashima sent a telegram to Shidehara stating: "Doihara's purpose in coming to Tianjin is to fulfill the wishes of the Kwantung Army, plotting to quickly oust Puyi, striking at Zhang Xueliang's power, as a prerequisite for Manchurian independence. He is determined to disregard any advice and will take free action independently by the Kwantung Army, even if it violates national policy." On November 26, 1931, Yano, a secretary at the Japanese Legation in Beiping, sent a telegram to Shidehara, reporting that the famous spy Kawashima Yoshiko, on the orders of the Kwantung Army Staff Officer Itagaki, had secretly come to Tianjin disguised as a man, plotting to take the "Empress Dowager Xuantong" to the Northeast. On November 27, the Consul-General in Tianjin sent a telegram to Shidehara, reporting that the military had notified them that "Empress Dowager Xuantong had secretly escaped" on the 26th and would take the Changshan Maru to the Northeast on the 27th. With the presentation of these documents complete, the examination of Puyi came to an end. Next, Englishman Frank Gear testified. Gear served as a policeman in the Shanghai Municipal Council after 1934, working on narcotics issues and is currently employed at the British Consulate General in Shanghai. Gear stated that before the Sino-Japanese War, opium sales were prohibited, but the Wang puppet regime undermined the laws upon its establishment. Next, Tong Shoumin, manager of the Shanghai Pudong Electricity Company, was summoned to testify, describing the economic aggression of the Japanese army.

### Semenov Confesses, Conspired with Japan to Seize Siberia

[United Press, Moscow, 27th] Semenov, a 56-year-old White Russian counter-revolutionary leader, was arrested in the nine eastern provinces of China and is being tried by a military tribunal along with seven of his accomplices. All of them are charged with espionage, terrorism, and waging war against the Soviet Union. The Soviet government has been waiting for an opportunity to capture Semenov for nearly thirty years. He succeeded Admiral Kolchak as the leader of the White Russian Guard, a Siberian counter-revolutionary group. The ages of the defendants vary, up to 70 years old, including 51-year-old Ukhtomsky, a former prince of the Tsarist era. During his trial before the military tribunal, Semenov confessed that he had maintained close collusion with Japan throughout World War II, established a large-scale spy network, and conspired to seize all of the Soviet Union's Asian territories for Japan. He allegedly colluded with Japan for over 25 years, aiming to launch a counter-revolution, destroy the Soviet regime, and once participated in a plot to assassinate Lenin and other Bolshevik leaders.

### Australia Suggests to Relevant Countries the Establishment of a Pacific Regional Conference, Success Depends on U.S. Attitude

[United Press, Canberra, 27th] Today, sources close to the Australian government stated that Australia has proposed to relevant countries the organization of a Pacific regional conference, with its headquarters in Australia. The British and New Zealand governments have expressed strong support. Other countries invited to participate include the United States, France, the Netherlands, and Portugal, and perhaps China as well. Observers here believe that the success of this proposal depends on the attitude of the United States. Australia made this proposal solely for its own defense interests. It is heard that the British government has suggested that it should also be granted general authority over economic issues. Well-informed sources say that a meeting of the British Empire's autonomous territories may be held here in January next year to discuss Pacific issues, and concrete decisions are expected to be made at that time.

### Behind the Soviet Government, Stalin Exerts Absolute Power, Poskrebyshev is His Eyes and Ears

In recent international events, almost every event is related to the Soviet Union. The importance of this polar bear's position is evident. On August 19, Time magazine published an article on the overview of the Soviet domestic regime. This article is translated for the readers.

Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov once said, "Everyone who can read and write can understand the Soviet Union." But what is the reality? The political organization of any country is always different in form from its actual style. This difference is greater in the Soviet Union than in any other country, because the Soviet Communist Party is the government hidden behind the Soviet Union, and it controls the nominal Soviet government.

The leader who holds all party, government, and military power is the leader of the Soviet Union, Stalin. The Red Army is directly under his command. At the same time, because of the organization of the Red Army Political Department, the Communist Party can monitor the actions of the Red Army.

Stalin has his own personal secretariat headed by General Poskrebyshev, who was promoted last month. His duties perhaps best illustrate the Soviet approach. Foreigners who go to see Stalin have all encountered him, because he sits in the outer office of Stalin's office - bald, short, and looking like a barrel. Stalin organized his private secretariat when he competed with Lenin. Since then, this secretariat has specialized in collecting information about Communist Party members who may resist Stalin. Within the circle of the Communist Party, they all call this general "the wolf-swallowing louse" behind his back.

According to the Soviet Constitution, power is from the bottom up, but in reality, it is from the top down. The leader's louse is one of the reasons for this.

The party currently has six million members, which is 3.5 million more than six years ago. They elect the All-Soviet Communist Party Congress, and from this Congress emerges the Central Committee, which has 71 members plus 68 alternate members. During the recess between the two congresses, this committee guides all party affairs. Under the committee are three agencies: (1) the Politburo, composed of 14 people, which decides all domestic and foreign policies, perhaps the largest group in the world; (2) the Organizational Bureau, the agency that executes party policies; and (3) the Secretariat, the agency that manages the Organizational Bureau.

The two houses of the Supreme Soviet government are elected by 120 million voters (the Soviet population is 200 million). The two houses meet twice a year. During the days of the meeting, you can see these deputies applauding and unanimously protecting. During the recess, their duties are performed by the Presidium. The Presidium is composed of 33 people, and the current chairman, Shvernik, is a member of the Politburo.

The highest administrative management agency in the Soviet Union is the Council of Ministers. The current chairman and eight vice-chairmen are all members of the Politburo.

### Pan Yangyao and Tan Tiankai Scheduled for Sentencing on the 31st

[Our Own Dispatch] Pan Yangyao, the former secretary of the Four Banks Savings Association, was arrested and prosecuted on suspicion of being a traitor after serving as the chairman of "Yongfeng Bank" in Shanghai during the enemy's occupation and publishing several articles in puppet newspapers and magazines. During the trial at the High Court, Pan admitted to having served as the chairman of Yongfeng Bank, but claimed that the bank was purely a commercial bank and did not engage in hoarding, speculation, or disrupting the country. As for the articles published in puppet newspapers, most of them were expressing dissatisfaction with the current situation at the time, and the prosecutor has taken them out of context, and he does not admit guilt in any way.

### Citywide Street Vendors Jointly Petition, Mayor Firmly Refuses, Believes Many of the Goods Sold are Stolen, Decides to Strictly Ban Starting Next Month

[Our Own Dispatch] Since the municipal government announced that it would ban street vendors starting September 1, more than 5,000 street vendors in the city gathered at Xikou Road (Zhu Bao Road) at around 9:00 AM yesterday to jointly petition the municipal government. They were stopped by military police at Jiangxi Road and turned to Guangdong Road, Henan Road, Minguo Road, Zhonghua Road, Fangxie Road, and Daji Road to gather at the Public Sports Field. They elected three representatives, Liu Rulin, Su Ruofei, and Li Hongru, to go to the municipal government at 11:15 AM to request an audience with the mayor to personally submit a petition. After receiving them, the mayor rejected the street vendors' request, believing that the street vendors were not small businesses and that some of them had capital of more than 10 million yuan, and that many of their goods were stolen from wharves and warehouses, so they could not be considered. At 3:00 PM, the three representatives of the street vendors also petitioned the administrative office of the police bureau, but were also rejected. Before the municipal government decided to ban the city's street vendors, it received a telegram from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce on August 20, which stated: "It is found that on June 23 this year, the association convened a membership meeting of the ninth district. According to the joint proposal of various guilds such as department stores, southern goods, toothpaste, tooth bone ware, iron pots, pottery, western clothing, commercial auctions, and flower and tree businesses, the suggestion to ban street vendors is roughly as follows: Setting up stalls on the road has long been on the list of bans, which not only detracts from the appearance but also hinders hygiene. Recently, huge capital has been used to sell smuggled or stolen bulk goods from the docks, and no taxes are paid on the profits, which affects national tax revenue and store business. Please forward this to the municipal government for strict banning. The association has reported the situation and requested adoption and implementation, but has not yet received approval. Therefore, we re-telegraph and request that the government approve the implementation for public convenience. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce." Upon receiving this telegram, the municipal government immediately issued the following instructions: "The telegram has been read. It has been decided that street vendors on the roads in this city, except for those selling cigarettes, newspapers, snacks, and books, who are allowed to set up stalls in places that do not obstruct traffic, will not be allowed to set up stalls without permission starting September 1st. This has been announced to the public on the 20th of this month, and the police bureau has been ordered to implement the ban in earnest. This is hereby notified." Mayor Wu decided at a municipal meeting that after banning street vendors, he ordered the police bureau to instruct each sub-bureau to send personnel to persuade the street vendors in their respective jurisdictions to change their profession within a time limit, starting from the date of the order, and not to make mistakes. According to the municipal government, it will strictly implement the ban on street vendors in this city starting on September 1.

### Route of the Number 2 Public Bus Changed, Via North Sichuan Road to the North Station

The route of the number 2 temporary public bus in this city was originally planned to run from the Old North Gate along Henan Road to the North Railway Station, but recently, in order to improve traffic in the central district, the authorities changed Henan Road to one-way traffic, and all vehicles are only allowed to go from north to south, not from south to north. The public bus had no choice but to change its route. Starting today, it will depart from the Old North Gate, go north along Minguo Road to Tiantai Road, cross the Sichuan Road Bridge along South Sichuan Road, go west along North Sichuan Road and Wu County Road to North Henan Road, and reach the North Railway Station. After this change, the road money has increased a lot, and it is much more convenient for those who want to go to the North Sichuan Road area, but in order to take into account the burden on passengers, the authorities will not increase the fare for the time being, and the entire line is still 200 yuan.

### Trekking Through Mountains and Rivers to Transport Salt, Only to End Up Losing Money: Salt Merchants in a Distressed Situation

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] As the saying goes, "There's no place like home, and no salt like the world's best!" Salt holds the fourth position among the seven necessities of daily life. Every meal requires salt. Everyone eats salt, and every household uses salt, but how many people know the details of salt?

According to estimates by several salt merchant alliances: The monthly salt consumption in this city was around 50,000 *zu* a month ago. The main consumers are soy sauce workshops, preserved meat and food businesses, and pickled vegetable producers. Most electroplating factories have shut down due to the dumping of foreign goods. Otherwise, the amount of salt used for industrial purposes would be quite substantial, and the monthly consumption would certainly be more than the currently estimated 50,000 *dan*!

Originally, the difference between official and private salt was only whether or not taxes had been paid. Salt that has been taxed is generally called official salt. Otherwise, it is private salt. Currently, most of the edible salt used in this city is official salt that has been taxed.

Currently, the main source of official salt is a batch of *Wen-Tai* salt stored by the Shanghai Salt Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance that was seized from enemy and puppet regimes. It is said that this batch of salt is of low quality and dark in color, but the warehouse price is still 16,500 yuan per *dan*. The Salt Affairs Office has warehouses, one in *Pudong* and one in *Nanshi* *Gua Jie*. If the goods are shipped from the *Pudong* warehouse, the price per *dan* to Shanghai would exceed 18,000 yuan. It is said that this batch of stored salt is almost completely distributed.

The sources of salt from other ports include *Yuyao Chang*, *Biao-Pu Chang*, and *Dai-Shan Chang*. Among them, *Yuyao Chang* has the most abundant production, but unfortunately, it lacks transportation tools, making it difficult to transport and sell. The salt produced in these places is all fine salt. Most of the salt imported is taxed locally. There is also a batch of coarse-grained *Huai-Lu* smuggled salt, which comes from *Shandong* and northern *Jiangsu*. Most of the producing areas of this batch of salt are under the control of the Communist army. General transporters often adopt a barter trade method to exchange goods. Usually, after the salt arrives at *Wusongkou*, taxes are then paid for import. Currently, the largest suppliers to this city are still *Dai-Shan* and *Huai-Lu* areas.

It is said that the cost of salt produced in *Yuyao*, *Biao-Pu*, and *Dai-Shan* is only 6,000 yuan per *dan*. However, the salt tax per *dan* is over 8,000 yuan, plus transportation and miscellaneous expenses, the price of each *dan* to Shanghai already exceeds 17,000 yuan. Furthermore, the cost of *Huai* smuggled salt is 11,000 yuan per *dan*, and after arriving in Shanghai, it needs to be taxed over 6,000 yuan, so each *dan* also costs 17,500 to 17,600 yuan.

Speaking of private salt, because the salt police force is insufficient, it has not been completely eliminated. Moreover, the quantity is indeed considerable. It is said that this batch of private salt is also smuggled out of various salt-producing cities without paying taxes. However, precisely because it is private salt, it has undergone layers of "black eats black" extortion and blackmail during the process of coming to Shanghai. The cost to Shanghai also amounts to 12,000 to 13,000 yuan per *dan*. Most of this batch of private salt is landed on the long beaches of *Pudong*, collected by salt dealers, and transported to the city for sale. Since the prices of salt transported to Shanghai from various places are fixed at 17,000 to 18,000 yuan per *dan*. On the one hand, the Shanghai Salt Affairs Office is infinitely allocating and selling salt at a price of 16,500 yuan per *dan*. Salt merchants can apply for allocations, and soy sauce workshops, preserved meat shops, etc., can also directly apply for allocations. In this way, the transport merchants are suffering, and what can they rely on to make a profit? Trekking through mountains and rivers to transport salt, only to end up losing money. As a result, one after another, they stop business and quit. In their distressed situation, they harbor a resentment, which is that they hope that the salt authorities will have a reasonable adjustment to the salt price, especially starting from suppressing and reducing salt taxes, so that salt merchants can still have a bite to eat, and citizens can eat affordable salt!

### The *Gui-Sheng* Ship Re-Clears Customs: Departing North Yesterday Without Loading Cargo or Passengers

### Two Trade Associations Achieve Close Cooperation

It is also learned that *Chen Pan-jun*, Chairman of the Customs Brokerage Association of this city, received a letter from the Shipping Association the day before yesterday, requesting that he advise all customs brokerage firms not to report the shipment of domestic goods on foreign ships, so as to jointly maintain shipping rights. He immediately convened an emergency meeting of the industry, and *Chen Pan-jun*, together with *Liang Guan-wu*, *Bao Hai-ping*, *Gan Zi-zhang*, and *Dai Bing-li*, met with *Li Yun-liang*, Secretary of the Shipping Association. *Chen* stated that with respect to the declaration of British ships by various customs brokers, the goods had been delayed for nearly a month, and most of them were food. The famine in the north was urgent, so it was necessary to transport them north for relief. Reporting on British ships was a last resort and not a lack of protection of shipping rights. He hoped that the Shipping Association could cooperate with the Customs Brokerage Association to provide convenience to the customs brokers by various shipping companies, so that they would not report on foreign ships again. *Li* said that he had repeatedly sent letters to various shipping companies to that effect. Through close cooperation, the final instruction was that all goods returned by the *Gui-Sheng* ship could be reloaded onto the *Zhao-Shang-Ju Gong-Xing* ship, *Zhong-Lian* and other companies' *Guo-Lian* ships, as well as the *Fu-Sheng* and *Lin-An* ships, etc., which could all be transported north before the end of the month. At this point, the Shipping Association and the Customs Brokerage Association have reached a satisfactory solution.

### Investigating the Labor Situation to Begin on September 1st

[Report from Our Newspaper] Shanghai is a hub of industry and commerce, with more factories than any other part of the country. After the victory, there has been no thorough investigation and statistics on the labor situation in this city, and the government has little reasonable basis for handling labor-capital issues to provide parameters. The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau and the Shanghai Municipal Government Statistics Office have therefore invited eight agencies, including the Statistics Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Executive Yuan, the Central Bank, the Economic Research Office, the China Textile Corporation, and the China Branch of the International Labor Bureau, to organize the Shanghai Municipal Labor Situation Investigation Committee. The inaugural meeting was held at the Social Bureau on August 17th of this year, and *Wu Kai-xian*, Director of the Social Bureau, was elected as Chairman, and *Chen Da*, Professor of *Qinghua University*, was elected as Vice Chairman. Under the Committee, a Technical Committee was established to design, research, investigate, and statistical work. It is reported that the investigation expenses are jointly subsidized by the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Affairs with 50 million yuan, and the remaining participating agencies jointly subsidize 30 million yuan. The investigation period starts from September 1st and is stipulated to be three months. Thirty investigators are separately dispatched by the participating agencies, and it is also reported that they have begun working at the Shanghai Municipal Government Statistics Office on the third floor of the Municipal Bank on *Jiujiang Road*.

### UNRRA Landing Craft Sailing to *Hankou* Attacked by Artillery Fire Four Times Overnight, Fortunately Without Damage

The UNRRA waterway transport team's landing craft "Wanren" sailed from Shanghai to Hankou last week carrying relief supplies and was nearly hit by artillery fire. The landing craft was carrying a large number of trucks, food, and medical equipment, and was flying the "UNRRA Transport Team Flag." On the first night, the craft was anchored near *Longtan River*, 73 miles from *Wusong*. Suddenly, in the middle of the night, a burst of gunfire was heard, and the sailors on board were awakened from their dreams. Initially, it was rifle bullets, followed by light anti-aircraft artillery shells, which landed 100 yards from the ship's surface. The shells came from the north. Captain *Kwick* closed the starboard windows. The craft was attacked four times that night before dawn.

### Loud Alarms in *Huangpu District*: Police Officers Mobilized to Block Roads: "Capturing Three Thieves": Afterwards, a Performance Was Announced

[Report from Our Newspaper] All the businesses, shops, and residents in the *Huangpu District* have completed the installation of alarms. The police department officially accepted the completion yesterday. Deputy Director *Du Wang*, together with the Chief of the First Division *Wang Liyan* and the Chief of the Second Division *Zhou Guanghui*, led police officers to inspect them one by one in the district last night at 8 p.m. The results were good. *Zhu Feng-xiang*, Chief of the Communications Section of the Municipal Police Department, also participated in the event, and ten volunteer police officers also enthusiastically participated. More than half an hour after the inspection was completed, the alarm at *Jinfeng Hardware Store* at No. 295 *Beijing Road* reported a theft case. The alarm rang loudly in the bureau, and the chief of the branch bureau personally led uniformed, plainclothes, and volunteer police officers to mobilize all important road intersections and strictly blocked them off. Some police officers bravely rounded up the suspects. After a search, one suspect was apprehended. According to his confession, there were two accomplices, who had fled south along the *Bund*, and described the clothing of the two criminals, one wearing a Zhongshan suit and the other wearing gray shirt and pants, both around 25 or 26 years old, one taller than the other. He then used a street telephone to report to the branch bureau, and the branch bureau chief dispatched additional reserve police officers to intercept them at *Lingling Road*. Within a few minutes, the two suspects were immediately captured. After taking them to the bureau, Branch Director *Du* announced that this was a "fake performance." The three suspects apprehended were all disguised as the branch bureau. The first purpose was to test the alarm; the second was to test the effectiveness of the street telephone; and the third was to test the agility of the police officers.

### US Military Tribunal Separately Trying Two War Criminals: *Watanabe* Claims Previous Confession Records Were Mistranslated

(Report from Our Newspaper) The *Hok* case continued yesterday morning at the US military tribunal, with the questioning of the two defendants, Major *Watanabe Masamori* and Major General *Fukuchi Shunnan*. Chief Inspector *Dewey* questioned *Watanabe*, showing him a record of his confession during the interrogation in June of this year, stating that the trial of *Hok* was unfair. However, *Watanabe* claimed that it was the result of mistranslation by the translator and his own excessive nervousness. He also stated that after receiving a telephone notice from the War Crimes Office of MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo, he surrendered himself because he firmly believed that there was nothing unfair about the trial of *Hok*. Otherwise, he could have absconded in Japan. Major General *Fukuchi Shunnan* testified that his order to try *Hok* was on the order of the Japanese Operations Department and again submitted a letter of request from the then-Chief Justice *Saborn Shii* to the Deputy Minister of the Tokyo Operations Department as evidence. Yesterday morning, the defendant's defense repeatedly accused the prosecutor, with Colonel *Bolding* accusing Major *Dewey* of obliterating the facts with sophistry. *Dewey* replied with a sarcastic tone: "The defense lawyers are all lawyers and not ignorant infants," and said that there was a female writer *Emily Halm*'s husband, Major *Charlie Box*, who was imprisoned by the Japanese army in *Stanley Prison*, Hong Kong. This person was proficient in Japanese, and the Japanese military court should have allowed him to defend *Hok* in order to reduce the unfairness.

### High Tide in the *Huangpu River* Next Month: Boats Could Be Sailing on Land

According to the tidal forecast released yesterday by the *Huangpu River* Dredging Bureau, a high tide will occur in the *Huangpu River* on the 11th of next month, reaching a height of 12.45 feet. According to the fact that the *Huangpu River* has been dredged less in recent years, if the tide is slightly high, the river water will flow back out of the hazard ditches on the various roads. As yesterday afternoon, the tide was not too high, but the river water had already flowed back up, and such phenomena occurred in low-lying roads such as *Guangxi Road* and *Guizhou Road*. Once a high tide occurs, the labor will be in vain.

### Three Threatening Letters Sent to the Catholic *Leisi* Elementary School

(Report from Our Newspaper) The *Leisi* Elementary School, founded by the Catholic Archdiocese at No. 36 *Sichuan South Road*, suddenly received three threatening letters from the 25th to the 28th of this month, instructing the school principal, *Xu Zong-ze*, to immediately dismiss *Ye Cheng-huai* (33 years old), a teacher of more than six years, otherwise the school would be burned down with "sulfur bombs." *Ye Cheng-huai* reported the letter to the police station last night and requested an investigation.

### Thief Outcries "Catch the Thief!" Golden Bracelet Robber Caught

[Report from Our Newspaper] At 4 p.m. yesterday, a customer came to *Zhenhe Silver Store* at No. 24 *Jinling Middle Road* carrying a paper package and placed it on the counter, claiming to want to buy a golden bracelet. The shop assistant showed four golden bracelets, weighing more than four taels. Unexpectedly, after the customer obtained the above jewelry, he turned around and ran away. The shop assistant chased after him. The thief, in desperation, came up with a clever idea and, while running away, shouted "Catch the thief!" to confuse passersby. He was eventually arrested by the sentry. The original stolen goods were found on the spot, but there were no weapons. After being detained and interrogated by the Taishan Branch Bureau, he confessed his name as *He Ren-fu*, 32 years old, from *Xiaoshan*. He was forced to take this measure due to unemployment.

### *Yu Xiang-yan* Makes False Accusations: Police Department Debunks Them in One Sentence

*Yu Xiang-yan*, the female mastermind in the *Road Bureau Grand Embezzlement Case*, tried to threaten *Chen Bo-zhuang* unsuccessfully. After being detained, she falsely accused *Chen Bo-zhuang* of extorting 5 million from *Zhang Hong-tu* and the police department of embezzling more than 7 million in stolen goods. According to the person in charge of the police department, speaking to a reporter from *Hua-Che-She* yesterday: The truth about *Yu*'s false accusation of *Chen Bo-zhuang*'s extortion will come to light one day, so there is no need to defend it now. As for the accusation that the police department embezzled 7 million in stolen money and only handed over 3 million to the court, it is even more absurd. The department recovered more than 66.8 million in stolen goods this time. This amount of stolen money was ordered to be handed over to the Road Bureau in full, and the 15 criminals and all the files were transferred to the District Procuratorate. The stolen money was never transferred to the court, so the accusation is self-defeating. In addition, the District Procuratorate's investigation of the entire case is nearing completion and is currently drafting the indictment, which will be formally filed within a few days.

### Scheme to Steal Gold Bars: Clever Use of the "Golden Cicada Sheds Its Shell" Tactic

At approximately 11 a.m. on the 26th, at the *Da-Dou-Cheng Silver Store* on *Nanjing Road* in this city, two customers, a man and a woman, arrived carrying a net bag containing several stacks of thousand-yuan notes. After the man entered, he first asked the clerk to show him a gold bracelet for inspection, but immediately returned it. He then asked to see a large gold bar, placed the net bag on the bench, and claimed that the light in the store was too dim. He took it to the door to inspect it, while the female customer remained seated in the store. After five minutes, the man had not returned to the store, so the employees in the store anxiously went out, but the man had already escaped without a trace. Upon closer inspection of the money brought by the man, in addition to a few thousand-yuan notes on the surface, there was actually a glass cup wrapped in white paper. The employees then realized that they had been scammed. The clerk immediately reported the situation to the Huangpu Branch Bureau and took the woman who had come with him to the bureau for questioning. According to the woman, her name is *Zhang Mei-ying*, 23 years old, from *Wusong*, and she is currently a hostess named *Wang Mei-ying* at the *Tian-Yun-Lou Night Garden*. She said that she had only met the man the night before, so she did not even know his name. Coming to *Tian-Dou-Cheng Silver Store* was also at the invitation of the man the night before, and so on. The police bureau is intensifying the pursuit of the mastermind of this scam.

### The Taskforce for the Recovery of Enemy and Puppet Assets Inspects Military Supply Warehouses: Preservation is Complete, No Signs of Rotting

The Taskforce for the Recovery of Enemy and Puppet Assets in the *Su-Zhe-Wan* area held its regular meeting yesterday morning. Director *Zhang* and all the members were present, and the work of the taskforce was reviewed. Regarding the *Sun Tian-chang* case, it was decided to transfer it to the court for investigation. When a reporter asked Director *Zhang* whether the 50-day work deadline would be extended, he replied, "All the cases investigated by our taskforce will be handled as quickly as possible within the prescribed time limit. As for when we will go to *Hangzhou*, it has not been determined yet." The taskforce will immediately begin investigating the corruption case of the China Textile Corporation. At 3 p.m. in the afternoon, Director *Zhang*, together with Committee members *Wu Wang-ji*, *Zhang Qing-zhen*, *Liu Gong-yun*, Director of the Bureau for the Recovery of Enemy and Puppet Assets in the *Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Anhui* Area, and Special Commissioner *Zhao Zhi-yao* of the former Ministry of Military Affairs, accompanied them to inspect the military supply warehouses. The inspections covered three parts: supply storage warehouses, medical material storage warehouses, and ordnance storage warehouses. Generally speaking: (1) The stored supplies, such as military uniforms, military clothing, grass-green fabrics, as well as cotton quilts, cotton wool, mosquito nets, mattress covers, etc., are very well preserved and there are no signs of rotting. (2) In addition to American medicines, the medical material storage also contains some medicines seized from Japan. The Military Medical Department has not yet decided how to deal with them. (3) The stored ordnance is extremely well preserved. Explosive military supplies are stored separately and are inspected regularly. The management is better than that of ordinary warehouses. Due to time constraints yesterday, the inspection could not be completed, and the inspection will continue this afternoon. Regarding some of the non-public necessary medicines seized in the medical material warehouse, the National Defense Ministry's Military Medical Department will establish a Research Association for the Disposal of Seized Japanese Goods to study the disposal methods. The Health Department of the First Supply Area Command is actively preparing for this, and the Bureau for the Recovery of Enemy and Puppet Assets will be invited to discuss the matter together. It is also reported that the relevant agencies will also discuss the disposal methods for military supplies attached to customs in the past and some non-military supplies stored by the Joint Logistics Headquarters.

### Female Performer Yuan Xuefen Suffers Unusual Experience, Accuses Colleagues of Prank

[Our Newspaper Report] Yuan Xuefen, the famous Yue opera star performing at the Star Grand Theater, was traveling in her private chartered car at around 10:15 AM yesterday morning. As she drove along Jing'an Temple Road into Gaoshiman Dance Response Lane, intending to reach a certain residence, a thug, lying in wait at that location, suddenly appeared. Holding a chamber pot filled with feces, he poured it over Yuan's head, leaving her soaked from head to toe and surrounded by a foul odor. The chauffeur, witnessing the scene, immediately stopped the car and gave chase, but the assailant fled towards Xieqiao Lane. Afterwards, Yuan reported the incident to the newly established Chengfen Police Station. Director Zhuo of the station personally questioned her, finding no existing grudges. She stated that she had been in Shanghai for many years and had never offended anyone. However, recently, Yue opera colleagues were planning to organize a "Yue Opera Professional Association" and invited her to initiate it. Because she was unwilling to participate, she incurred the dissatisfaction of her colleagues, perhaps leading to the hiring of a rogue to carry out this prank.

### Rice Merchants Raise Rice Prices, Eight More Found During Investigation

After the foreign exchange adjustment, the city's grain market has been calm and normal due to the authorities' sale of foreign rice. However, a few unscrupulous rice merchants are still arbitrarily raising rice prices. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to investigate and found eight shops, including Yongchang, Fulong, Zhu Hengyu, Dachang, Yongyuantai and its branches, Zhou Shixin, and Xieji, charging prices ranging from 64,000 to 68,000. The persons in charge of each store will be summoned for questioning. According to Mr. Huang Jiaju, a specialist committee member of the city government, speaking to a Dazhong News Agency reporter, "I was ordered to inspect various districts and found that a few rice shops were marking up prices unreasonably. In addition to the Social Affairs Bureau ordering corrections, I sincerely hope that the residents of this city will report any violations at any time. Anyone who raises rice prices will be severely punished."

### Guangdong Fugitive Arrested in Shanghai

[Our Newspaper Report] He Youhuan, 60 years old, a native of Dapu County, Guangdong, who was sentenced to six years by the Higher Court of Dapu County, bribed two escorts and took the opportunity to escape to Shanghai. He lived at the home of his fellow villager, He Junda, at No. 8 Fukang Lane, Gaodun Street, Nanshi. After a confidential report was made to the Luxiangyuan Road Police Station, Officer Fu Kuangshi learned of the situation and reported it to the Yemiao Police Sub-bureau.

### Murder Case in Pudong, Court Conducts Preliminary Hearing Yesterday

The Yangsi Bridge National Self-Defense Force Punan District Third Brigade Seventh Company Third Squad headquarters was located at No. 47 Dangli Village, three miles north of Yangsi Town. It had a total of 50 members and 16 self-provided rifles. However, late at night on June 15 of this year, a group of armed thugs broke into the unit, demanding that all members hand over their weapons. However, the Self-Defense Force had already been ordered by the city government to disband its organization, and the guns had already been handed over to the Shanghai Headquarters in full. Therefore, the demand could not be met. The group did not believe this, and searched separately, but still found nothing. The thugs then tied up the squad leader, Xi Langting, and the squad leaders Zhu Miaoxiang, Xi Jielang, Tao Yi, and Pan Yuxiang, and then took them to a nearby rice field, where they were shot and killed. Two members, Xi Liangdong and Zhu Mingquan, were seriously injured. However, squad leader Ju Xilin, who was absent that night, was hiding at the home of relatives on Qiujiang Road in the city, was suspected. He was arrested by the Yangsi Bridge Police Sub-bureau. Yesterday morning, the case was given preliminary hearing at the District Procuratorate. Xi Liangdong and Zhu Mingquan, who had recovered from their injuries, both appeared in court to testify. As a result, the court adjourned for further review.

### First Unfortunate Incident After Teachers' Day: National School Vandalized

Thousands of Elementary School Students Demand Admission, Unsuccessful

The No. 16 Central National School on Tanggu Road, etc., in this city, was originally a Japanese elementary school. In February of this year, the City Education Bureau ordered Ms. Jin Qijing, a native of Hangzhou, to be appointed as the principal. After Principal Jin took over the school, she devoted herself to reorganization, expanding the classrooms to 22, which could accommodate 1,000 students. After the end of the last semester, Principal Jin prepared to hand over the school due to funding problems. She was instructed by Director Gu to encourage her to continue her efforts in education, and she began to recruit new students. Recently, private school tuition fees have been high. The school stipulates that no tuition fees will be charged, so the number of new students who signed up for the examination reached more than 2,200. The school authorities, in addition to continuing with 600 old students, had a quota of only more than 300 students. Yesterday, the list of newly admitted students was announced, and more than 300 new students were admitted. There were still 1,900 students who were not on the list, so they jointly asked Principal Jin, "We all want to study, please help us, Principal"! Principal Jin was so moved to tears when she heard the innocent children's requests, but the classroom capacity and economic problems made it difficult to accept them. She gave a brief speech to the elementary school students, urging them to go home. Unexpectedly, at this moment, a few students poured in, and doors, windows, desks, and benches flew around, causing great losses. Later, Principal Jin reported to the Minhang Road Police Sub-bureau, and Director Wang ordered several police officers to go to the school to maintain order and investigate the extent of the losses in order to report them.

[Another News] At the Municipal Penglu Elementary School, because there were too many students applying for this year, some students could not be accommodated. When the names of the new students were announced this morning, a few students surrounded the school and demanded admission. The Education Bureau immediately sent two inspectors, Song Zijing and Xu Jintao, to rush to the school to persuade them. The police bureau also sent personnel to maintain order and notify the parents of each student. They dispersed in the evening.

According to an educator, this is the first unfortunate incident after Teachers' Day. Vandalizing school equipment and surrounding the school is caused by many elementary school students demanding admission but not being able to get it. This is an unprecedented scandal and a disgrace to the country. It is hoped that the authorities will quickly raise education funds, establish more national elementary schools, and accommodate as many school-age children who are eager to study as possible so that such unfortunate incidents will not happen again.

Civil Affairs Briefing

### Municipal Government Orders All Districts to Investigate People Wounded or Killed During the Resistance Against Japan All Districts Should Investigate, Compile, Fill Out, and Transfer Reports for Review

The Municipal Government previously received a telegram from Minister Wei Shili of the Ministry of Internal Affairs: Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, people in various places have been aware of the seriousness of the national crisis and the urgency of the nation's crisis, and have risen up to save the country. Some have been loyal to their duties and generously gone to their deaths. Some have assisted the national army and served in the border areas. Some have been arrested and unyielding and have resisted and completed their chastity. The various acts of loyalty, courage, and chastity are enough to move the wind and rain and move ghosts and gods. At a time when the great enemy has surrendered and lost land has been recovered, how to commend the dead and how to comfort the relatives of the loyal and martyrs must be universally investigated and handled separately in accordance with the law, in order to comfort the souls of the loyal and inspire them. The telegram attached the investigation form for people wounded or killed during the resistance against Japan. The municipal government has ordered all district offices under its jurisdiction to investigate, compile, fill out, and transfer reports to the Ministry for review. Because it has been a long time, the reports filled out by various districts have been few. Yesterday, another order was issued to urge reporting in order to transfer them.

### Municipal Government Inspection Committee Mobilizes Public and Education Personnel to Participate in Inspection

### Filling Stinking Ditches in the Thirteenth District

Several stinking ditches in the vicinity of Yaoshui Lane and north of Anyuan Road in western Shanghai were formed by the discharge of sewage from nearby factories and shantytowns. During the summer months, evaporation causes a foul odor to spread, and mosquitoes and gnats breed prolifically, easily leading to epidemics. Moreover, it is often heard that pedestrians accidentally fall into them at night. It is now reported that the "Bao" chiefs of the relevant 24th "Bao" and others are initiating collective measures to fill these ditches, based on the district's formulated guidelines for implementing environmental hygiene.

Installing Water and Electricity Pipes
Most residents of Yinghua Lane in western Shanghai are workers. Originally, they obtained their drinking water from water pipes installed by factories. Recently, due to factory cost-cutting measures, these small pipes were cut off. The "Bao" chiefs of the 18th and 19th "Bao", along with district people's representatives, convened a "Bao" residents' assembly to raise funds and openly tender for water and electricity projects. The district sent personnel to supervise the process. The outcome of the meeting was quite satisfactory, and it is reported that the project is now actively underway.

Establishing Literacy Classes
The district has been promoting a literacy campaign and has convened several joint meetings of school principals, "Bao" chiefs, and local education enthusiasts to discuss the implementation of the work. Many proposals have been put forward and implemented. It is recently reported that participation in the classes has been very enthusiastic, with 20 classes tentatively scheduled to begin soon.

### District Briefs

Chen Pengfei, the "Bao" chief of the 18th "Bao" in the 18th District, had been suffering from heart disease. Regrettably, at 9:00 AM on the 21st of this month, his condition worsened and he passed away. The vacant position of "Bao" chief will be temporarily filled by Sun Chengfu, the deputy "Bao" chief of the "Bao".

The positions of deputy "Bao" chief in the 21st "Bao" and the 30th "Bao" of the 12th District have been vacant for a long time. It is now learned that the district office has nominated Pan Zuxing and Hu Tingsheng to fill these positions, and the nominations were submitted to the Municipal Government for approval yesterday.

Xu Peilin, the "Jia" (sub-neighborhood unit) chief of the 23rd "Jia" of the 6th "Bao" in the 1st District, and He Xirui, the "Jia" chief of the 11th "Jia" of the 22nd "Bao", have resigned. He Chuntao and Wang Zijun have been appointed to fill the vacancies, respectively.

The district office has approved their resignations and appointed Li Rongbao and Wu Tianhong to succeed them, respectively.

### Questions and Answers on the Household Registration Law (Continued)

(46) Question: If two brothers establish new households due to separation, should the original household be canceled, and should each of them re-apply for household establishment and registration?

Answer: One household should remain as the head of the original household, or register changes in family members. The other household should re-apply for household establishment and registration.

(47) Question: When processing "Baojia" (collective responsibility system) matters, are students, soldiers, and prisoners subject to household registration investigation? If not, should they process household registration and personnel registration?

Answer: Temporarily, they do not need to process it.

(48) Question: When registering households, should all eight items specified in Article 99 of the Household Registration Law be registered?

Answer: During registration, the items related to the registration event should be registered according to the provisions of that article. For example, for registration of changes in the head of household, registration should be done according to the provisions of Item 1 of that article.

(49) Question: Does the term "collateral relatives" in Article 100 of the Household Registration Law, in addition to spouses, include other relatives by marriage?

Answer: Direct relatives, in addition to spouses, do not include other relatives by marriage. If relatives by marriage are also permanent members of the household, they should be included in the category of other family members.

(50) Question: If a civil servant or merchant residing in another county already has a permanent residence in this county and has lived here for six months, but their stay is uncertain due to work, can they establish a temporary residence?

Answer: Yes, they can establish a temporary residence.

(51) Question: According to the provisions of Article 93 of the Household Registration Law, when personnel registration matters cause changes in household registration, it should also be registered in the corresponding household registration book. It seems that a separate household registration application form is not required. Is it possible to waive the filling of the form?

Answer: Yes, it can be waived.

(52) Question: What should be the unit for the household registration of people in a Governing Bureau?

Answer: A Governing Bureau is a preliminary institution for preparing for the establishment of a county. Central and provincial single-item regulations refer to counties, cities, and bureaus interchangeably. Therefore, the status of a bureau is equivalent to that of a county or city, and the household registration of people within its jurisdiction should naturally be based on the bureau as the unit.

(53) Question: The establishment, removal, and relocation of temporary residence are not specified in the law. Should they be handled according to the provisions of Articles 45 to 50 of the Household Registration Law?

Answer: The transfer of temporary residence should be handled according to the procedures for transferring permanent residence as stipulated in Article 44, Paragraph 3 of the Household Registration Law. Therefore, the establishment, removal, and relocation of temporary residence can be handled by referring to the aforementioned legal precedents and following the provisions of Articles 46 to 50 of the same law.

### Second District Establishes Special Committees

### National and Private Cotton Mills Cooperate to Change Cotton Yarn Distribution Procedures: Private Mills Can Be Allocated 20,000 Pieces; Prices Still Determined by the Textile Construction Corporation

[Reported by our newspaper] The black market for cotton cloth and yarn was slightly calmer yesterday, but the demand for cloth remained tight, especially for colored and patterned fabrics. This is partly because cooperation between private and state-owned mills is limited to specific yarn allocation plans, while how to supply cloth is still under consideration. Furthermore, more cotton cloth than cotton yarn is shipped to other cities. According to sources at the Textile Construction Corporation, listed prices for distributed goods will definitely be maintained, but procedures will be adjusted to benefit actual users and reduce speculation. Therefore, purchase applications received yesterday were processed separately for producers and retailers. The approved purchase quantities had to be announced by 7:00 or 8:00 PM that afternoon, and payment was required the next day. The collection agency has been changed to the Bank of China, which shows progress compared to past practices. Sources close to private cotton mills say that they have decided to assist the Textile Construction Corporation in centralized, open, and fair-priced distribution of yarn, which will be implemented the day after tomorrow. The amount is set at 20,000 pieces, allocated to each mill according to the number of spindles and looms. A specialized committee established by the guild will handle the allocation. Purchasers must first apply to the yarn mills they have dealt with in the past. After the mills approve the quantity, they will submit it to the guild, which will set the price and allocate the goods. The price must be approved by the Textile Construction Corporation and announced that afternoon. According to market sources, the total amount of yarn distributed by private mills this time will be issued in the form of forward-dated warehouse receipts. Whether these warehouse receipts can avoid becoming speculative tools is still a concern. Well-informed sources say that much of the floral cloth distributed to the yarn mills by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) a month ago has not yet been settled for foreign exchange. UNRRA has repeatedly demanded settlement based on the new exchange rate, which would inevitably increase the cost of cotton yarn. Therefore, the yarn mills are hesitant about selling at fair prices. Several mills have submitted written complaints to UNRRA, requesting settlement at the old exchange rate, but have not received a response. It is rumored that they will submit a report to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting continued support. They also say that if calculated at the new exchange rate, the cost of ordinary 20-count yarn, including factory depreciation, is around 1.2 million per piece.

[Another report] Wu Weijing, the deputy general manager of the China Textile Construction Corporation, told reporters yesterday that although the yarn market has risen slightly since the exchange rate adjustment, the quantity and price of yarn and cloth allocated by the Textile Construction Corporation have remained unchanged. When Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs was in Shanghai, he convened a meeting of the heads of various private yarn mills to discuss cooperation between state-owned and private yarn mills to suppress yarn prices. Recently, the heads of the relevant yarn mills have repeatedly convened meetings to discuss the establishment of a joint distribution agency. After the establishment of this agency, state-owned and private yarn mills will jointly supply cotton yarn for distribution in order to suppress yarn prices. The Textile Construction Corporation will take a leading role in suppressing prices and will strive to cooperate in distribution to stabilize yarn prices.

Furthermore, the Textile Construction Corporation's tenth auction includes various fabrics, undershirts and pants, cotton-wool undershirts and pants, cotton yarn, cotton blankets, and a batch of miscellaneous goods, divided into twelve groups. Yesterday, a notice was issued to invite tenders for purchase. The deadline for paying the deposit is 12:00 noon on August 30th. Viewing of the goods will be from 1:00 to 6:00 PM on the 30th and from 8:00 AM to 12:00 noon on the 31st. Bidding will be from 1:00 to 3:30 PM on the 31st, and it is scheduled that the bids will be opened in public one hour after the bidding deadline.

### Numerous Market Rumors Lead to Uniform Plunge in Gold and Currency

Yesterday, rumors suddenly surfaced that the government would nationalize gold, causing widespread unease. Coupled with constant pressure, prices gradually weakened. From a weak opening of 2.18 million in the morning, it was immediately surrounded by selling pressure. Although it struggled for a while, it fell to around 2.125 million after 10:00 AM. The Central Bank distributed 82 gold bars at a price of 2.12 million, but the market remained weak and unable to recover. Near noon, it broke through the 2.1 million mark, struggling around 2.085 million at noon. In the afternoon, it continued to fluctuate around the same level. As a result, it fell 85,000 compared to the previous close. Jewelry gold was down 22,000, silver remained unchanged, and silver dollars declined slightly. The black market exchange rate was tight due to gold and currency settlements, various taxes, and tight monetary conditions. Interest rates were around 1.5%.

Foreign currencies also faced various unfavorable speculations, and the situation was bleak. US dollars opened at 3,410 yuan and gradually declined. Although there was a slight pause in the middle, the overall trend was difficult to resist, and it fell to a low price of 3,330 yuan near noon, before stabilizing. There was arbitrage activity in the afternoon, and it rose to around 3,360 yuan, resulting in a decrease of 45 yuan compared to the previous close. The ratio to gold was calculated at 620 yuan per ten taels. Hong Kong dollars fell slightly by 35 yuan due to remittances. Hong Kong exchange rate was 720 to 730 yuan, Indian exchange rate was 870 to 880 yuan, British exchange rate was 11,650 yuan, and the US exchange rate remained at the listed price.

### When Can the Public Bond Mystery Be Solved?

Yesterday, two major players, "Five-Story" and "Seven-Story," continued to be active in public bonds. The buying side was extremely excited, and trading was brisk, with a total of over 4 million yuan. "Tong Bing" bonds opened at 1,650 yuan. Although they once fell to below 1,550 yuan after the opening, buyers immediately became active and gradually pushed the price up to 1,920 yuan, at which point many closed out their positions. The price then fell back to below 1,850 yuan near the close. "Jia Yi" bonds rebounded from 900 yuan to 1,050 yuan, and "Tong Wu" bonds rose from 1,350 yuan to 1,500 yuan. Only "Tong Ding" bonds were the most sluggish. As a result, "Jia Yi Bing" bonds each rose less than 200 yuan compared to before the market closure, while "Ding Wu" bonds rose by 70-80 yuan.

### Forward Foreign Exchange Interest Rate

Designated Banks Changed to 4.2%

After the adjustment of the foreign exchange rate, the Central Bank reduced the interest rate on forward foreign exchange from 5% to 3%. However, the designated banks felt that this regulation was too low and were unwilling to act as agents. After negotiation among the designated banks, the rate was raised to 4.2%. Calculated at 3%, the monthly interest was 100 yuan for 3,350 yuan, making the total 3,450 yuan. Now, calculated at 4.2%, the monthly interest is 140 yuan, making the one-month forward foreign exchange rate 3,490 yuan.

### Xu Xueyu Completes Task: Taiwan Rice to Be Shipped to Shanghai Soon

[Reported by our newspaper] Xu Xueyu, the general manager of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, flew to Taiwan on the 22nd of this month on the orders of President Song to negotiate the shipment of Taiwan rice to Shanghai. He has now completed his mission and flew back to Shanghai the day before yesterday. It is now learned that Xu has completed his task, and Taiwan rice will soon be shipped to Shanghai in large quantities to provide relief. Xu has designated the "Haiyu" freighter to sail to Taiwan on September 3rd to load the rice. Subsequently, Taiwan white rice will arrive steadily, ensuring that the city's food supply is sufficient and that the people will not suffer from food shortages, and that grain prices can be stabilized.

### Vice Minister Pan Xulun Discusses Government Economic Policies

[Reported from Nanjing on the 27th by our newspaper] Vice Minister Pan Xulun of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, when interviewed by reporters on the 27th, denied that we would take measures to prohibit the import of cotton yarn or hardware. However, he said that the government would find ways to adjust the tax rates on certain imported goods, which may be announced within a few days. He also said that the Supreme National Defense Council had discussed raising import taxes. Regarding the exchange rate adjustment, Pan believes that this will encourage the export of domestic goods. In the future, the government will continue to adopt subsidy policies for the export of raw silk and other goods. Regarding the rising price of cotton yarn in Shanghai, he said that after the exchange rate adjustment, Shanghai yarn merchants rushed to order from the Textile Construction Corporation, with orders reaching 40,000 bales in one day, almost equal to the total output of the company for several months. The authorities are paying close attention to suppressing yarn prices and have decided to invite private manufacturers to join the Cotton Textile Management Committee to unify distribution.

### Tianjin Stock Exchange Approved to Resume Operations

Tianjin, 27th: The North China Securities Exchange was ordered to suspend trading in April of this year. It then applied for resumption of operations, citing the example of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. As previously reported, reliable sources now report that the Tianjin Municipal Government has received an order from the Ministry approving the resumption of operations. Preparations are currently underway. The principal is Yang Liushou. It has been observed that since the suspension of trading at the Tianjin Stock Exchange, securities trading has been quite chaotic, and much of the idle capital has turned to hoarding. The resumption of operations of the exchange may bring things back to order.

### Tight Credit Conditions and Poor Environment: Large Sell-Off of Chinese and Foreign Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks experienced a large sell-off due to tight credit conditions. The yarn and cloth industry had to release Chinese stocks in order to cope with the capital needed to open cotton yarn from the Textile Construction Corporation. As a result, a selling frenzy began, and prices gradually declined. At the high opening prices, Yong Yarn was 733 yuan, Meiya was 4,430 yuan, Jingfu was 270 yuan, Xinguang was 288 yuan, and Quanxing was 210 yuan. After the opening, sellers were numerous, and prices fell sharply. Near noon, all showed low prices: Yong Yarn was 655 yuan, Meiya was 3,650 yuan, Xinguang was 238 yuan, Jingfu was 218 yuan, and Quanxing was 155 yuan. Prices recovered slightly near the close. Smaller and mid-sized stocks in various cold sectors were also pressured by the selling wave. The veteran stocks suddenly declined. As a result, Yong Yarn fell by a little less than 10%, Meiya, Jingfu, and Xinguang each fell by 15%, and Quanxing also fell by around 20%. Smaller and mid-sized stocks in colder sectors each fell by 10% to 20%. Veteran stocks also fell by more than 10%.

The environment for foreign stocks was generally poor, and there were also many declines. The opening prices for all stocks were dismal, with supply exceeding demand and difficulties in selling. Low prices were seen near noon. As a result, Yisha, British Union, and Asia each fell by 10% compared to before the market closure, while Huide, Yibei, Paper, and Steel each fell by about 5%. The declines in the industrial sector and Guangye were not as significant.

### Textile Construction Corporation Changes Distribution Method; Yarn and Cloth Market Prices Both Decline Yesterday

Yesterday, the yarn market turned down. From the morning, there were rumors that the authorities would centralize distribution, causing market sentiment to become uneasy. "Double Horse" yarn once fell to as low as 1.6 million, before recovering to 1.69 million due to buying. The closing price of 20-count mixed-brand yarn also fell by 100,000, 16-count yarn fell by 50-70,000, and 42-count yarn fell by a significant 200,000. At noon, the Textile Construction Corporation listed fair prices as usual. Although purchasers were extremely enthusiastic, the allocation amount was far from sufficient. It is reported that the Textile Construction Corporation, in order to prevent speculation by related industries, will change its method of selling cotton cloth and yarn from the 29th of this month. Cotton yarn and cloth opened on that day must be paid for and picked up the next day, and the qualification for opening loans will be cancelled if delayed. With many closing out positions, the market fell. However, sales on the customer side are still sustainable, as it is gradually entering the peak season. As a result, each cloth fell by about 1,000-2,000 yuan.

The cloth market, which had been rising for several days, turned down slightly yesterday. This was because those who had made profits sold off their positions. At the same time, the Textile Construction Corporation changed its policy regarding the sale of cotton cloth and cotton yarn from the 29th. Yarn and cloth purchased on a given day had to be paid for and picked up the next day, and the qualification for opening loans would be cancelled if delayed. Many closed out positions, and the market fell. However, demand from customers remained sustainable, as the peak sales season was approaching. As a result, each cloth fell by about 1,000-2,000 yuan.

### Stock Exchange to Hold Founders' Meeting to Elect First Board of Directors; Internal Organization Divided into Four Departments and One Office

[Reported by our newspaper] After the Ministry of Economic Affairs approved the first batch of 234 stock exchange brokers, the stock exchange yesterday sent letters to each approved broker, instructing them to first pay a cash deposit of 20 million yuan. On that day, more than 80 brokers paid in full. The brokers who have paid the deposit will draw lots at the stock exchange at 11:00 AM today to determine the order in which they will conduct transactions and to distribute telephone lines to each broker in the trading floor. The remaining brokers who have not paid are also expected to pay within a few days to avoid delays in the installation of telephone lines.

It is reported that the Stock Exchange will convene a full founders' meeting within one or two days to facilitate the establishment of four departments (finance, administration, investigation, and research) and one secretariat. The appointment of General Manager Wang Zhixin and Assistant Managers Gu Shanchang and Yang Sapu should not be a problem. The clearing house will also be established within a few days, and it is expected that Wang Zhixin will also serve as its manager. The supervisors sent by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to the stock exchange are also expected to arrive in Shanghai before the end of the month.

After the establishment of this stock exchange, there will be an era-defining reform compared to the old Chinese Stock Exchange. In terms of calculation methods, the old Chinese Stock Exchange often required mobilizing 120 people and working for more than 15 hours to complete the day's work. With the new methods, only 10 people are needed, and the entire process can be completed in two hours. In addition, the accounting system for brokers will also adopt a uniform format. Currently, there are two types, Chinese and Western, and they are being drafted by the accounting firms of Xu Yongzuo and Xi Yuqi. Each broker can choose one to use. In the future, the stock exchange will send auditors to each broker at any time to check their business operations.

The construction of the stock exchange building has been completed, and the interior design of each department has entered the final stage. It is expected that the opening can be held as scheduled on September 9th.

### Abundant Arrival of New Rice; Mixed Grains Rise More Than Fall

Yesterday, the rice market saw arrivals mainly from Jiaxing, Jiashan, Kunshan, and Pudong, mainly new rice. Old rice and "Bai Yuan" rice were scarce. Therefore, "Bai Geng" rice remained popular, and "Bai Yuan" rice was still fragrant and dry. New "Geng" rice was less popular, falling slightly by 1,000 yuan. New and old "Xian" rice were of average quality. 29,000 bags of Brazilian American rice continued to be distributed in the north and south markets. Flour mills released very little, and demand exceeded supply. The market outside the mills continued to rise by 300-400 yuan. Wheat from Fujian and Shantou was consumed, with white wheat still preferred in the north. High prices were active, rising by 300-500 yuan, while mid- and low-grade wheat were flat. However, the market softened slightly at noon. Wheat bran was selling well in rural areas, rising by another 200-300 yuan. Supplies of Qingdao oil were gradually becoming scarce, and stores gradually increased prices by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Soybeans saw an influx of supply, with some inquiries from Shantou and Quanzhou. Old beans were scarce and prices remained firm, while new beans were sluggish and prices were weak, falling by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Broad beans were stable. Sesame seeds continued to decline in downstream sales, falling by 1,000 yuan. New peanuts from northern Jiangsu have appeared, but transportation is inconvenient. Chaozhou has made some purchases. Prices are rising as the old and new seasons transition, rising by another 1,000-2,000 yuan. Bean cakes are selling slowly, with no movement in other cities, falling by another 200-300 yuan. New corn arrivals continued, with small fluctuations of 500-600 yuan.

### Twenty-Seven Hankou Money Shops Request Registration but Are Denied

Our newspaper, Hankou, 28th: Twenty-seven money shops in Hankou applied for business registration but were denied. The Ministry of Finance also ordered the Hankou Municipal Government to supervise and stop their operations to avoid affecting the financial situation.

### Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Supervise Loans; Contracts Signed Yesterday

Since the establishment of the Shanghai Area Food Salt Loan Syndicate of 21.2 billion yuan, many commercial banks and money shops have enthusiastically joined the syndicate. The banks account for 4.765 billion yuan, with Jiangsu Peasant Bank alone underwriting 2.455 billion yuan. All the money shops together contributed 535 million yuan. Together, these amount to 5.3 billion yuan. The remaining 15.9 billion yuan will be undertaken by the Three Banks and Two Bureaus. Yesterday was the day when member banks and money shops signed contracts. The syndicate's work became very busy at once. The loan targets are salt merchants and salt dealers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, and factories under supervision. They must first find a guarantor, and three businesses must jointly guarantee each other. After the approval of the Supervision and Government Bureau, they can directly receive loans from the syndicate.

### Northeast Red Army Currency

Registration Period Will Not Be Extended; Approximately 2.2 Billion Registered

[Reported by our newspaper, Shenyang, 27th] After the expiration of the Northeast Red Army currency registration period, the authorities decided not to extend it. The registration amount in Shenyang, Changchun, Siping, and Yongji was over 800 million, and the total amount, including the inventory of various agencies, was over 100 million, totaling over 900 million. Shenyang had the most. The other counties and cities will end by the end of this month, but as of the 25th, the total was over 400 million. In summary, the total registered amount of Red Army currency in areas where Northeast government orders are implemented is over 2.2 billion. The detailed figures are being cleared and will be fully paid with circulating currency. As for small-denomination Red Army currency below ten yuan, many merchants still refuse to use it. The Economic Committee has therefore ordered the Northeast branches of the Central Bank to unconditionally redeem it from now on to avoid public panic. The exchange rate between the Northeast industrial and commercial exchange and the circulating currency is under negotiation. The price of circulating currency has been rising daily. According to a report from the inspection agency, the black market has reached 13.5 yuan of legal currency per yuan of circulating currency. The Northeast Branch of the Four Joint Offices now holds a joint meeting every Saturday, attended by the heads of various financial institutions to discuss the exchange situation of the week and formulate countermeasures.

### Exchange Rate Between Taiwan Currency and Legal Currency

Will It Be Set at One to Thirty-Seven?

After the government prevented the plan to set the Taiwan currency at one to forty yuan of legal currency, sources now say that the Taiwan currency will still be allowed to float, possibly changing to one Taiwan dollar to thirty-seven or thirty-eight yuan of legal currency.

### Soviet Gold Production

Approximately 3.5 Million Ounces per Year

[Reuters, Basel, 27th] The International Bank recently estimated that Soviet gold production is approximately 3,500,000 ounces per year. World gold production in 1945 was approximately 27,000,000 ounces, compared to 28,000,000 ounces in 1944 and 41,000,000 ounces in 1941.

### Coal Market Gradually Stabilizing

The upward trend of white coal and "Huai" coal prices in the coal market has slowed down. Traders, feeling that prices have risen too sharply in recent days, are no longer buying if they have no actual sales. The Commercial Joint Sales Office of Hongji White Coal Seam and Bituminous Coal is still distributing coal as usual, and the distribution price has not changed. Therefore, the market price has also remained stable. Since white coal blocks and liquid fuel prices rose sharply, sales at various coal shops have gradually become smoother, and the market price has slightly increased.

### Meltons Sell Well

American "Cang Qing" (dark blue) Melton fabrics have recently been selling very well among woolen fabrics. There is a considerable amount of fabric being released daily from public tea parties and wholesale houses. Ordinary brokers and street vendors are also involved in the trade. Local businesses and customers continue to demand purchases, as the public generally believes that the fabric is cheap and of good quality. Coats, robes, and uniforms for the army, navy, government, railways, and women, men, and children of all ages are suitable. Actual sales are bound to be widespread. Therefore, although supplies continue to arrive, public confidence remains quite stable. If there is no large-scale ordering by outsiders, it would not be surprising if the price of this quality fabric rose to over 30,000 yuan per yard. The highest price has been 27,500 yuan, and the lowest has been 16,000 yuan. Yesterday, the market price was 23-24,000 yuan, with white-edged fabric being more popular than black-edged fabric.

### Sellers Holding Too Firmly on Prices; Old Qimen Tea Sales Have Stalled

It has been observed that although British export firms in this city have been very interested in purchasing high-grade old Qimen tea, the sellers are currently holding too firm on prices, making it difficult to obtain the tea. Therefore, sales have been temporarily suspended. According to buyers, they will consider making further purchases if suppliers are willing to make concessions. Otherwise, enquiries are being made for old "Chou Zhen" and old "Zhen Mei" teas, with Wu Chang, Dadechang, Hua Tea, and Wang Qiaotai all showing interest. The market is active, and selling prices are high. However, the B.O.P. grade Taiwan fine black tea, which is being watched by Indian firms, is rarely traded due to limited arrivals and inventory. However, Qimen floral and broken black teas are selling more and more smoothly, and there is likely to be further price increases in the future. As for domestic sales of red and green tea, Suxi and other places have not stopped trading, and public confidence remains strong.

### United States Lifts Freeze on Deposits Made Before 1945

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] The US Treasury Department announced tonight that it is lifting the freeze on foreign deposits in the United States made before October 5, 1945, with the exception of deposits made by German and Japanese nationals. This action by the Treasury Department is intended to alleviate the financial difficulties of foreign refugees in the United States.

### Price Limits for American Cotton Textiles - Adjustment of Changes

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] The Price Administration Bureau recently announced that starting in September, monthly price limits for cotton textiles will be adjusted based on the average price of cotton within the previous two weeks, rather than the previous practice of adjusting based on the average monthly market price. This decision was made in response to the request of the cotton textile industry, as the price limits set in this way can better meet the actual cost needs.

### Large Quantity of Counterfeit "Sailboat" Brand Spool Thread Seized

[Report from this Newspaper] The Xin Fu Firm of this port recently discovered that there were many imitations of the "Sailboat" brand spool thread produced by the firm on the market. They reported this to the police bureau and requested an investigation. Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, the wife of the main suspect, Wei Dazeng (also known as Pei Zeng), was arrested at No. 73 Kangjia Lane, Fangbang Road, Nanshi, above the Shanghai Socks Factory. Dazeng and the remaining accomplices are on the run. A large number of counterfeit trademark models and substandard yarn spools were also seized. It is said that the interrogation is currently underway at the Police Headquarters.

### Raw Silk Export Still Difficult to Resolve After Exchange Rate Adjustment - Promising Autumn Silkworm Rearing in Zhejiang Province

This year, silk factories are facing difficulties in development due to the high cost of purchasing spring cocoons for silk production, while the price of silk abroad is lower than the production cost in our country. Therefore, silk businesses are suffering significant losses from foreign sales and cannot afford to export. Most silk factories are either reducing production or stockpiling already produced silk, unwilling to sell at a loss. After the government adjusted the exchange rate and exempted export taxes, silk industry giants claimed that, according to the new exchange rate, the export price of raw silk is still far from covering the cost, and the difficulty of exporting raw silk cannot be effectively resolved.

Further reports indicate that Zhejiang Province, as a silkworm-producing area, has promising prospects for raw silk exports after the exchange rate adjustment. The autumn season is about to begin, and farmers are already interested in silkworm rearing. Rearing will begin in early September, and cocoons can be harvested after twenty days. The government is providing subsidies for this autumn planting, which will reduce the cost for silkworm farmers. The province currently has 180,000 autumn plantings, mostly distributed from cold storage in Hangzhou and Jiaxing. The distribution area is the western Zhejiang silkworm region, accounting for 80%, and the eastern Zhejiang region, accounting for 20%. It is estimated that each planting will yield 15 catties of cocoons, totaling over 20,000 *dan* of fresh cocoons. With each *dan* valued at 120,000 yuan, the total value is approximately 2.4 billion yuan, which will significantly benefit the rural economy. It is said that autumn silkworm rearing allows farmers to utilize their spare time, and the limited quantity means that the required mulberry leaves are mostly self-supplied, reducing costs. Therefore, the current situation is different from spring silkworm rearing.

### Northwest Exploration Notes

— Gao Zhongrun

The War of Resistance has brought us many changes and much progress. Problems that were once overlooked are now valued. Places that were once difficult to reach are now being explored. I, who grew up in a coastal region, never imagined that I would have the opportunity to roam the wilderness of the inland Gobi. Although transportation is extremely difficult, the lessons and understanding that the war has given us can overcome all hardships. We strive to improve and reach the point where people conquer nature.

What a vast Northwest! Occupying a quarter of the country's territory, it has turbulent rivers flowing without end, magnificent mountains stretching for thousands of miles, remnants of previous development, and a millennial ancient culture. It possesses an indescribable purity, magnanimity, greatness, and openness, deserving of people's appreciation and praise! In this great embrace, there are also ever-changing mirages, which are originally illusory decorations, but this illusion brings comfort to those who experience it firsthand. In the long and silent wilderness, the wind carries the sound of distant bells. These are the camels bearing heavy loads and traveling far, advancing steadily from the desert. They are enduring and patient, fulfilling their task of serving. The desert hares and Gobi antelopes gallop nimbly and lightly across the vast and boundless desert, appearing increasingly free, providing people with much inspiration. However, when ordinary people step on the remains of those camels and other livestock, they cannot help but pity the lives of these animals and lament their hard work in serving humans.

The scenery of the Northwest, influenced by the natural environment, has many differences from the inland provinces. The lives of the people and social dynamics all exhibit unique characteristics. These unique aspects are truly interesting to contemplate, especially when looking back on past events. Now, taking advantage of leisure time, I recall past events. Although I cannot help but feel a sense of nostalgia, a journey of over 30,000 *li* to the vast Northwest is undoubtedly worth recounting.

### The Leap Forward in Lanzhou

In the middle of two mountains and a river lies an ancient city - Lanzhou. Although it is not as splendid as Shanghai, the prosperity of the city adds to its vibrant atmosphere!

Mount Fulan, south of the city, stands tall and majestic, appearing like a screen. The lower part of the mountain is also called Five Springs Mountain, said to have five springs named "Sweet Dew, Scooping the Moon, Ju Zi, Meng, Hui". Ancient trees are scattered among the mountains, and Buddhist temples are lined up, making it a scenic area. However, it is no longer a place for ordinary people to visit. A military expert accompanied me on a trip to the mountain, and I was truly honored. We reached the highest pavilion and looked north, where the long and narrow Lanzhou was filled with yellow sand and dust. Sand and dust are common in the Northwest, but it is inevitably a bit difficult to get used to at first.

The Yellow River flows along the north side of Lanzhou City. Because we passed by during the winter season, the rolling torrent was frozen like a white silk band. This scene, which is not often seen in Jiangnan, gave us an opportunity to appreciate it. The Zhenyuan Iron Bridge, which spans the Yellow River, is the only vital passage connecting the north and south. It is similar to the Waibaidu Bridge in Shanghai, supported by steel frames. However, years of wear and tear have caused it to slowly deteriorate without repair. Across the Yellow River Iron Bridge is White Pagoda Mountain, which has many small temples, but the architecture is much inferior to Five Springs Mountain. Since it was winter, the entire mountain was barren, without a single blade of grass, presenting a scene of yellow desolation that could not evoke people's aesthetic sense.

There are quite a few grocery stores in Lanzhou run by Uyghurs from Xinjiang, and their signs often contain a sense of homesickness. Gaochang, Tarim, and Altay are all place names in Xinjiang Province, but in Lanzhou, they have become the signs of larger Uyghur-run shops, expressing a strong local flavor. It's not just the signs, but also the precious local products, such as Turpan grapes, Hami melon dried fruits, Kuqa almond kernels, and other foreign goods from Xinjiang.

Gansu's production is limited by natural conditions, and cotton textiles are not abundant. However, the easy access to wool has made wool textiles relatively developed in Lanzhou. This is the only economic resource in the Northwest, and if it can be utilized on a large scale, it may be able to solve the problem of people's clothing. In Lanzhou, industries, medicine, education, and other fields all seem to be working hard and moving forward. This display of strength has added a lot of new vitality to the ancient city of Lanzhou. "Northwest Stronghold," the city's responsibility cannot be shirked. Lanzhou, what an ancient city! In the past eight years of the War of Resistance, it has already taken on the responsibility of construction!

### The Gansu-Xinjiang Highway

It was a clear morning in early spring with a strong winter feeling. The east had just revealed a fish-belly white glow, and the earth opened its sleepy eyes. The ancient and majestic Lanzhou was shrouded in morning wind and mist, originally possessing an indescribable tranquility, but it was soon broken by the sound of a wailing whistle. Ah! The Northwest Exploration Team, which had been preparing for a long time and was full of talent, set off from this dawn moment in the long-distance travel vehicles they had prepared in advance, bid farewell to Lanzhou, and began their westward journey.

The Northwest Exploration Team, composed of sixteen people with talents in transportation, water conservancy, agriculture, military medicine, social studies, and geography, boarded a long sedan and embarked on their journey. They formed a year-long relationship with the Gansu-Xinjiang Highway, which was originally Zuo Zongtang's route to Xinjiang. Many willows can still be seen along the road, said to have been planted by Zuo Gong during his western expedition. There is a poem: "The general's western expedition has not yet returned, the sons of Hunan fill the Tianshan Mountains, three thousand miles of newly planted willows, lead the spring breeze through the Jade Gate," praising Zuo Gong's achievements. Later generations, to commemorate his achievements, called those willows "Zuo Gong Willows." In the desolate and empty wilderness, the few willows dotted the landscape, providing people with much joy and excitement.

This only avenue connecting the Northwest has attracted people's attention due to the War of Resistance. In fact, 2,000 years ago, it was already a vital lifeline for transportation between China and foreign countries. It once connected Eastern and Western cultures, harmonized the feelings of various ethnic groups, and exchanged many materials... Now its mission is still important. This international avenue should be valued, protected, supported, and developed as an urgent matter.

The Hexi Corridor is a narrow and long terrain, extending from east to west. Due to the natural restrictions of the Qilian Mountains and the Beishan Mountains in the north and south, it cannot expand, forming a narrow shape. It resembles a dumbbell placed horizontally, or a bone with protrusions at both ends and a narrow middle. The Gansu-Xinjiang Highway follows the natural environmental trend, extending along it. There are many Han and Tang relics here. Although past events are like smoke, they are still valuable historical materials. The four commanderies of the Western River in the Han and Tang dynasties—Wuwei (Liangzhou), Zhangye (Ganzhou), Jiuquan (Suzhou), and Dunhuang (Guazhou)—were located on both sides of the avenue. The section from Wuwei to Zhangye is mostly natural Gobi, which required less investment in construction projects. From Zhangye to Jiuquan, the road surface is mostly paved with pebbles. Although these materials are everywhere in the Gobi Desert, it was the blood and sweat of people that made it possible to lay them neatly into a road. It is said that when paving the road, large teams of soldiers were mobilized to use their military caps to pick up the larger stones from afar and pave them into a long avenue. This kind of labor service is truly great. Those who walk on this avenue, how can they not be grateful! Once you leave Jiayuguan, the scenery becomes even more desolate, and supplies become even more difficult. The achievement of picking up stones and paving the road with military caps becomes even greater.

The Gansu-Xinjiang Highway does not always pass through flat Gobi Desert. Sometimes it also passes through alluvial fans (fan-shaped areas at the foot of mountains) of the Qilian Mountains. However, when the snow melts and the ice thaws, mountain torrents can destroy the highway. This situation is also common on the highway on the southern slope of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang. Therefore, wooden bridges must be supported on a section of the road so that the torrents can pass under the bridges, minimizing damage to the highway. However, the materials for building the bridges are mostly taken from the "Zuo Gong Willows" on both sides of the highway. Cutting off the love left behind by those who planted trees in the past to achieve the great cause of building roads today, although beneficial in one aspect and harmful in another, both have immortal value in terms of achievement.

### Braving Wind and Snow to Reach Yongdeng

When the exploration team left Lanzhou and headed west, a water pipe of a car burst when they reached He Kou. Fortunately, we had prepared an official letter stating that if there was a problem with the vehicle, we could contact the highway station on the spot for repairs. This was indeed much more convenient. While the car was being repaired, we saw that He Kou was the intersection of the Zhuanglang River and the Yellow River. The name He Kou must have come from this. On the bank of the Yellow River, we saw the ice floes brought down from the upper reaches, floating eastward piece by piece. The waterwheels near the shore had already been frozen by ice and snow and were not moving at all. The fields were yellow and withered, and people closed their doors and warmed themselves with their hands. This was still the feeling of winter in the north, even though it was early spring.

At this time, the sun was lazily setting in the west, and the sky was full of twilight. The wind was howling, the trees were moving, and sand and dust suddenly filled the air, making it difficult to distinguish anything. Some companions waited quietly in the car, while others went into a store to warm themselves. That night, the car reached Yongdeng County, and snow flakes like goose feathers were falling.

The snow in the north is like the rain in Jiangnan. It doesn't say much, but it can fall for three or four days at a time. Our journey was hindered by the snow. With nothing to do for a day, we borrowed more than a dozen horses from the county government to try riding. Because livestock is the main means of transportation in the Northwest, the most convenient and easiest to obtain is the horse. Riding a horse will be a part of life in the Northwest, so we must practice first.

In a small county town, there are not many households, and the market is very deserted. Suddenly, more than a dozen riders on horseback, walking on narrow streets, naturally attract attention. Riding a horse is not an easy task. Those who know how to ride a horse cannot guarantee that they will not make mistakes, let alone those who don't know how to ride. Everyone followed the principle of caution, not trying to run fast, but advancing slowly. Before we had gone too far, a companion who was accustomed to riding a horse impatiently said, "Riding this slowly is like a *zhuangyuan* parading the streets!" Amidst a burst of laughter, another companion who was not good at riding a horse retorted, "You should be fined! In this era of the Republic, where did the *zhuangyuan* come from? Your mind still has some feudal toxins…"

In a happy gathering, time always seems to pass too quickly. The sound of laughter and the sound of horses' hooves echoed into the old Manchu city. It turned out that Yongdeng County has two cities: one is the Han city, also known as the new city, where the shops and agencies are located; the other is the Manchu city, also known as the old city, which was the place where banner people who received salaries from the Qing Dynasty lived. Now the city is desolate and uninhabitable, with only a few Manchu families living in one corner of the city. In those days, they were "royal Qing families", but now they are destitute and have become beggars. When we returned the horses, we could not help but feel the fleeting nature of wealth and glory.

### Climbing over Niaosha Ridge

— Traveling west from Yongdeng for 69 kilometers, we climbed a majestic and rugged mountain road, which was the first high mountain we had passed since leaving Lanzhou, named Niaosha Ridge. It is approximately 3,000 meters above sea level. It is not very tall, but when we traveled through it, winter was still strong, and we saw that the mountain was covered in snow, so we could not help but think of it as a high place. The Gansu-Xinjiang Highway passes through the waist of the mountain. Although driving is not very difficult, the winding and twisting road makes travelers feel troubled.

There is a dilapidated temple on the top of the mountain, said to be the Han Xiangzi Temple, inhabited by several Taoists. Accompanied by them are several soldiers. The soldiers did not come here for no reason. If they did not have a special mission, they would never go to that high and cold mountain just to play around.

The Taoists are truly pitiful. On this high and cold mountain, although there is a lot of land, it is not worth planting. Their lives depend entirely on begging for food, and sometimes they can also receive a little incense money. Strangely, the power of Han Xiangzi is quite great. On the top of that barren mountain, he can actually win the faith of nearby villagers. Even traveling merchants have to burn incense and draw a lot, sincerely asking Han Xiangzi to guide them through their confusion and show them the path to wealth. When we rested in the dilapidated temple with two courtyards and six rooms and casually looked around, we saw a car driver drawing lots. When he saw us, he said generously, "You should also draw a lot. The lots here are very effective."

Traveling west from the Han Xiangzi Temple is downhill. At this time, the car is like a conscious animal, gliding downhill without effort. Before long, we reached Gulang. The county seat is built on a hillside, and the highway runs along the foot of the mountain. The streets and houses here are very simple. It is said that in 1930, Gansu suffered a major earthquake, and Gulang County was unfortunately destroyed by that earthquake. Now there are more cars traveling back and forth. Several restaurants have been added to both sides of the highway in that desolate environment. The Qilian Mountains are like a row of screens, separating Gansu and Qinghai provinces, creating the special geographical location of Gansu Province - narrow and long. From here westward, it is flat for thousands of miles, vast and boundless, reminding people - the four commanderies of the Hexi region in the Han and Tang dynasties began from here.

### Wuwei

— Ancient Liangzhou

Wuwei - ancient Liangzhou, is one of the four commanderies of the Hexi region during the Han Dynasty, 270 kilometers east of Lanzhou. Since we left Lanzhou and headed directly west, it can be regarded as the first important town in the Gansu Corridor. The total area of the territory is 190 *li* long from east to west and about 140 *li* wide from north to south. According to a survey conducted by the county in 1943, the population was 340,000, which was the highest among the counties in the Hexi region at the time.

As the name suggests, Wuwei seems to be showing off its martial prowess and flaunting its power. Before we had even stepped into its territory, hearing this fierce-sounding name, we all imagined what kind of terrifying and frightening face it would have. In fact, propaganda is just propaganda, and the reality is the true reality. When we saw that ancient city wall shrouded in broad daylight, we couldn't help but feel a sense of closeness and pleasure. It is not as scary as its name suggests, but instead appears more beautiful and prosperous. Of course, its beauty cannot compare to West Lake; its prosperity is far inferior to Shanghai. But in Gansu, where the land is barren and the people are poor, it can be considered a first-class place.

The wide and clean roads in the city, accompanied by orderly buildings, show the progress of local municipal administration. Many of the larger shops here are opened in black-lacquered doors. From the door you can see the counters, and if they move aside the lattice windows, they will stand at their posts and ask you what you want to buy. This is how the sales process goes. When we passed through Wuwei, we always felt that these shops with high black doors were very leisurely and comfortable, as if they didn't care whether they did business or not. The reason is that most of them only open for half a day and do business for half a day, and the so-called half a day is only three or two hours. I wondered how relaxed and comfortable they were, feeling like a hard-working ox rushing into that lonely land with sparse population and boundless expanse, how hard it was, and who was it for!

Because we were going north from Wuwei to Minqin County for inspection, we stayed here briefly to prepare. Therefore, we took a short tour of Wuwei both inside and outside the city. In terms of scenic spots, the Pingyuan Garden outside the north city is quite elegant. It is said that the owner, Ma XX, grew the trees and plants from scratch during the construction. Now the trees in the garden are competing for space, becoming more and more green and lush, and the flowers and plants are swaying in the light breeze, seeming to praise their freedom. However, the owner of the garden, because he changed to a new environment, has already left this beautiful place. Only a few pavilions, a few houses, and an old gardener are left. Because there is no pressure to supervise, the garden has become deserted. Although we are wanderers of the world and arrive on foot, we have nothing to do with it. However, touching the scenery makes us feel emotional, and we cannot help but sigh that the building is empty. Thinking about it, people are always seeking enjoyment, but enjoyment also depends on opportunity. Temporary enjoyment can comfort the obsessed soul, but thinking about it quietly, isn't it also fleeting wealth and glory?

Not far from the east gate of the city, there used to be a lake, next to which two temples were built - Dayun Temple and Qingyun Temple. There were two pagodas in the temple, but unfortunately that place rich in Buddhist art was destroyed by an earthquake on April 12, 1927. The pagodas collapsed, the temples were destroyed, and the lake dried up. Along with the collapse of the pagodas and temples, many lives were lost, perhaps they ascended to heaven with the bodhisattvas in the temples at the same time! Strangely enough, a bell tower a few feet away from the collapsed temple was not affected by the earthquake and still stands tall. Especially after the Qian'e Temple and the tall Buddhist pagoda were ravaged, it appears even more majestic and great. The bell tower is five or six *zhang* high, and the architectural style is like a bunker. Going up from the side door is like climbing a city tower. There are two floors on the city tower, with a stele on the bottom and a bell on the upper floor. The patterns on the bell are unique, with heavenly female figures carved on it. If we use the murals seen in the Mogao Grottoes of Dunhuang to measure the bell, it should be a relic of the Tang Dynasty. However, looking at the dim and blurry inscription below, it seems to record that King Zhang of the Former Liang Dynasty cast it with five kinds of metal. Why did King Zhang want to cast that bell, and why did he use five kinds of metal to cast it? These are all events like smoke, which have long been ethereal and unproven. In short, the age of that bell is quite old, there is no doubt about that.

The Confucian Temple in the south of the city is also magnificent and grand, containing many stone steles. A Western Xia script stele, which is relatively famous in the Hexi area, is displayed in this Confucian Temple. However, after many years and after being touched by people over many generations, the inscriptions have become blurred. Wuwei City is not too big, but there are vast plains around the four suburbs. The plains are densely wooded and the agriculture is abundant. It can be called a rich area in the Hexi region. The ancients had the saying "Golden Zhangye, Silver Wuwei." Although the famous Silver Wuwei is not as outstanding as Golden Zhangye, the remaining silver should still be valued by people!

Anti-Slip Wax

After waxing, floors are very slippery. The illustrated engineer James is using a special machine to test the effectiveness of anti-slip waxes.

### Trudging Through Wind and Snow

To conduct a grounded investigation, we must adopt a "no risk, no reward" spirit to undertake our task. Although local leaders and heads of various units provide valuable reports, on-site interviews are more effective; this is our belief. As the saying goes, "seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times." You say, what clarity and thoroughness can be achieved with a single sighting? It can help you resolve many doubts and bring indescribable pleasure. However, traveling in the Northwest is not as carefree as one might imagine. Take the road from Wuwei north to Minqin County, for instance. Cars are useless there. They can be as swift as lightning on flat ground, but in such places, they are as helpless as stranded fish, unable to move. Therefore, we hired four three-horse-drawn carts and set off across the vast, open plains swept by wind and snow.

In a place one has never been before, the excitement of curiosity can make one forget the pain, even though all sensations of life are bitter and painful, and instead feel even more exhilarated. On the boundless expanse where wind danced with snow, one might occasionally see a dozen or so camels passing by, accentuating our solitude. Otherwise, it could be said that birds had entered the cold forest and livestock were tethered in their sheds. We sat in open carts, assaulted by fierce winds that made it nearly impossible to open our eyes, and our path was blocked by goose feather-like snowflakes. Fortunately, when we departed from Wuwei, we hired a guide to show us the way through the vast, silver-gray world, a beacon of hope in the confusion.

On the first day, we stayed at the Zong Family Mansion, the first night on the way to Minqin. It was likely on that day that we crossed two large beaches: the Lu Family Beach and the South Beach. As the carts traversed the beaches, the wheels rubbed against the yellow sand, making a rustling sound. The horses' hooves sank into the sand; the harder they pulled, the deeper they sank, sometimes almost unable to free themselves. At times, the driver applied too much pressure, whipping the horses too harshly, causing their legs to give way, and they would suddenly kneel on their front legs or lose their footing on their hind legs. With great difficulty, we crossed the soft sand and reached more solid yellow soil. By this time, the horses pulling the carts were soaked in sweat. Despite the bitter cold, the horses' breath appeared hot. However, this heat quickly turned into ice in the horses' manes. As for us, sitting in the carts and not moving much, we felt the unforgiving chill of the frontier region. Even though we were all wearing old sheepskin coats, we still huddled together for warmth.

The Gobi Desert was truly desolate, with only a few scattered villages and sparse old trees. What met the eye was always an atmosphere of late autumn desolation. In fact, it was the season of late spring, yet it remained so bitterly cold. One could imagine that in the Jiangnan region, it was already the season for flowers to bloom in competition. Fashionable ladies might have changed into light single-layered garments, while we were still wrapped in our stinky old sheepskin coats, living a deep winter life. But strangely enough, as I and another companion were talking like this in the cart, less than ten paces from the Zong Family Mansion, behind a small straw shed, lay a naked person. It was first noticed by a companion in the front cart because we were in the second cart. In the blink of an eye, as our cart approached, we saw that it was a girl of about fourteen or fifteen years old. She bent over, propped herself up on her head, and reached out to beg from us. Her expression seemed to show shame, but driven by the need to survive, it was no wonder she had resorted to this. From this, we realized that the people in the Hexi region were indeed desperately poor, otherwise, why would a girl be naked to resist the cold and beg? A sense of compassion is innate in everyone. To show our sympathy and pity for her poverty, we collected some money for her. But upon careful reflection, how could that small amount of money solve her poverty problem, and such poverty was certainly not limited to her alone. As we were talking like this in the cart, we suddenly heard someone reciting loudly, "Behind vermillion gates, meat and wine abound, while on the road, lie corpses frozen to the ground." Our conversation was interrupted, and we paid attention to the source of the voice. It turned out to be an elderly companion in the last cart, shouting at nature in such a way.

### Answering Questions from Readers: Legal Queries

(1) Mortgage Loan

Question from Hong Dongling: I have a house left by my late father. In 1936, because a relative was short of funds for business, he borrowed from my mother. Since there was no cash available, my mother mortgaged the house to someone named Jia, receiving 700 yuan in legal tender for a term of three years. Upon expiration, Jia could freely dispose of it, and from that day on, Jia would collect rent to offset the interest. My mother and wife signed the agreement, and my father-in-law was the guarantor. Now I have the following questions and hope to receive answers:

(1) The mortgage loan agreement was not signed by me, and my mother and wife have since passed away. Does the agreement continue to be valid? (2) To comply with my late mother's will (oral), I have repeatedly negotiated with Jia, willing to repay 200 times the original amount. However, Jia believes there is an opportunity to exploit and insists on 500 times the amount. I believe the mortgage procedure is not legal and intend to deny it. I plan to submit a document to the land administration authorities stating that the contract is lost and request a replacement, and also publish a notice to search for it, setting a deadline for it to be invalidated. I am willing to donate the money to a charitable organization. Is this feasible? (3) If the mortgage loan agreement is considered legal, what is the procedure for redemption?

[Answer from Lawyer Qin Liankui] (1) A mother who mortgages real estate inherited by her adult son from his father, or real estate jointly inherited by her and her son from his father, without the son's consent, the adult son can deny the mortgage right. However, the debt incurred by the mother should be the responsibility of the mother's estate after her death. (2) There are no other statutory standards for how to increase payment when repaying pre-war loans, except for fair adjudication by the court. To avoid the complexity of litigation, it seems best to settle amicably. Regarding the recovery of the contract, if a settlement cannot be reached, you can file a lawsuit to deny the mortgage right and handle it together. If you falsely claim it is lost, it is not in accordance with the facts. Whether to donate to charity or not is not related to the recovery of the contract. (3) Refer to the answers in (1) and (2) for clarification.

(2) Establishing an Heir

Question from Wang Liren: I have several questions and would like your guidance: (1) My father passed away in 1929, leaving two sons and one daughter. The second daughter and youngest son were born to the stepmother. In 1933, the estate was divided into four parts according to law, with the stepmother and daughter each receiving one part. The youngest son suddenly passed away in 1939, unmarried and without children. Who inherits the youngest son's estate? (2) The stepmother is over seventy years old, and the daughter is not yet married. Now the eldest son and his wife are also approaching sixty, with only one daughter. The relatives are discussing establishing an heir, and also want to establish an heir for the deceased youngest son. Can Zhu know if this can be opposed? (3) Who inherits the stepmother's estate after her death? (4) Does the eldest son have the right to inherit the stepmother's estate?

[Answer from Lawyer Qin Liankui] (1) If a son born to the stepmother dies unmarried after the father's death, his estate is inherited by his biological mother. (2) The system of establishing an heir when there is no son was abolished on May 5, 1931, with the implementation of the Inheritance Section of the Civil Code. (3) If the stepmother dies in the future, her estate is inherited by her biological daughter. (4) A son who is not her biological child has no right to inherit.

(3) Dissolving an Engagement

Question from Jin Dongshen: When I was eighteen years old, my parents arranged an engagement with a Miss Ma from the same hometown. Although I firmly opposed it, my parents insisted on their own way. Now I am twenty-one years old, and the wedding date is approaching. (1) Is an engagement without my consent valid? (2) I don't know the other party at all, and I don't know their personality. Can I file a request to dissolve the engagement? (3) I am twenty-one years old. Do I have the right to make my own decisions about marriage? (4) I have no contact with the other party. Can the other party demand compensation when the engagement is dissolved? (5) If I am unwilling to marry and am absent on the wedding date, is it a crime?

[Answer from Lawyer Qin Liankui] (1) If parents arrange an engagement for their minor children, and the children do not express their consent after reaching adulthood, they are not bound by the engagement not arranged by themselves. (2) If the engagement was not arranged by oneself, and there is no act of ratification, it cannot be considered legally established, so there is no question of dissolving the engagement. In order to eliminate successive entanglements, a statement of non-binding can be made. (3) The Civil Code considers the age of twenty as adulthood. Those who have reached adulthood do not need to obtain parental consent for engagement and marriage. (4) Compensation is based on damage. If there is damage, the person causing the damage is responsible. The fact that there is no contact can be used as proof that the individual did not consent, and has nothing to do with the factual responsibility of the acting party. (5) Absence on the wedding date due to unwillingness to marry is by no means a criminal act.

A Strange Phenomenon Amidst the Urban Housing Shortage! Landlords Force Evictions, Leading to Homelessness. We Hope That All Sectors of Society Will Show the Greatest Sympathy.

Dear Editor: We are tenants who are about to be forced to live on the streets. In the midst of the authorities' efforts to alleviate the housing shortage, a strange drama is unfolding where landlords extort old tenants for small rents and use their power to forcibly evict tenants. It is truly heartbreaking!

We are five tenant households living in a large courtyard at No. 1 Houjia Lane, Xifahua Town. For the past seven or eight years, we have been on relatively good terms with the landlord, Mr. Huang. Three years ago, because the landlord could not establish himself in Shanghai, we tenants voluntarily planned and raised funds on his behalf, either by prepaying rent for two years or one year, to help him go to work in the rear area with this large sum of money. After the victory, the landlord also returned to Shanghai after demobilization. We tenants were secretly rejoicing, preparing to welcome the old landlord back in glory. However, Mr. Huang suddenly changed his old ways, instructing all tenants to vacate the premises so that he could lease them to new tenants and obtain huge transfer fees and small rents. Those who wished to continue renting would have to renegotiate the rent like new tenants. Fearing his power, the tenants swallowed their anger and repeatedly negotiated with him, and as a result, they agreed to pay a total of 600,000 yuan in rent and 1.5 dou of rice per household per month for a period of two years, with various harsh conditions attached. Fearing accidents as a safeguard, the tenants requested him to issue rent receipts, which resulted in a deadlock. Unexpectedly, on August 11, Huang led many soldier-like people to evict the tenants, threatening to demolish the houses. With great force, they entered the houses and arbitrarily demolished door panels, windows, lofts, and walls, and threw the tenants' furniture outside, sealing and nailing the doors. The unreasonableness of their actions can be imagined. At that time, all the able-bodied men of each household were out on business, leaving only women and children, who were frightened and cried upon seeing this. The situation was truly unbearable. Finally, after kneeling and begging bitterly, Huang reluctantly left with his group. Before leaving, he reiterated the tenants vacate the premises, otherwise he would come back to demolish the houses. At this point, the tenants felt that they had no way to appeal and no way to seek help. When the time comes, they will have no choice but to be forced to live on the streets and become refugees.

Dear Editor, the deadline is approaching, and how are we, these helpless common people, going to deal with this landlord? Therefore, we would like to use a corner of your valuable publication to make an urgent appeal to all sectors of society, asking for justice and assistance, and asking for guidance on how to handle this painful situation! (Respectfully submitted by all tenants of No. 1 Houjia Lane, Xifahua Town)

### Journey to Northern Jiangsu: Yangzhou, A Center for Refugees

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Hang Zhou

Comparable to London, which served as the center for exiled governments of small European countries during World War II, Yangzhou hosts a considerable number of Northern Jiangsu refugee county magistrates. At its peak, there were twelve, and currently, there are still six: Gaoyou, Shiying, Huaian, Huaiyin, Siyang, and Lianshui. In addition to the exiled county governments, there are also exiled county party headquarters and county youth leagues.

These exiled county magistrates are working diligently, preparing for their return home. Most of them are "locals" from Northern Jiangsu, familiar with the area. But what use is familiarity alone? All they have is a group of scattered refugees receiving relief, and a ravaged, seemingly unattainable land. As such, they possess almost nothing.

But they still have an exiled county government after all. The Jiangsu Provincial Government stipulates that the organization of an exiled county government consists of thirteen people, with a monthly budget of one million yuan (including staff salaries), a one-time allocation of fifteen million yuan for reconstruction, and one hundred rifles, hoping that they will cooperate with the military to fight back!

Exiled County Magistrates Can Only Smile Bitterly

Fifteen million yuan sounds like a rather impressive number. But nowadays, officials in Shanghai wouldn't even glance at it. Northern Jiangsu, which has been "struggled" by the Communist Party, is no different from a vacuum. Those so-called "liberated areas," once recovered, will require countless efforts to rebuild, and it is hard to know where to begin!

Nothing is more urgent than public security. If they were to use all fifteen million yuan solely for this purpose, it would still not be enough to equip a decent self-defense force. Military operations are underway in Northern Jiangsu. The military's task is to resist or defeat the enemy. Public security must be the responsibility of local authorities. "Can you take on this responsibility?" The exiled county magistrates can only smile bitterly. Not to mention the future, even in free Yangzhou, public security still needs to be maintained by the military.

Hugging Thighs and Begging Them to Go Slowly

A few days ago, the troops stationed at Dayi Market on Yangtian Road were reassigned to other tasks, and the defense was ordered to be taken over by the self-defense force. The self-defense force—a group of people who have not received proper training—were hesitant because they knew that remnants of the Communist forces were lurking near the area. The deadline for the troop transfer arrived, but the self-defense force had not yet arrived when the original troops left. Tens of thousands of local people immediately felt unprotected, broke down in tears, hugged the soldiers' legs, and begged them to leave slowly: "If the New Fourth Army comes, we will suffer!" Step by step, the soldiers took ten hours to travel twenty li.

Before the self-defense force arrived, the Communist forces arrived first. The pitiful Dayi Market suffered another massacre, especially those who had warmly welcomed the National Army. Later, the National Army sent another platoon to drive out the Communist forces.

Due to the Communist forces' "signature move"... guerrilla warfare, and the ubiquitous local teams and militias harassing everywhere, this issue deserves special attention. If the local armed forces cannot be established quickly and soundly, and if organization cannot be used to counter organization, the strength of the National Army will inevitably be dispersed and cannot be fully utilized.

Old Ox and Broken Cart: Military and Political Disconnect

The problem is not just this one; there are too many problems. The military requires close cooperation from the political side, operating as smoothly as a machine, but the political side is like an old ox pulling a broken cart. The military's simplest demands are for laborers, materials, intelligence, and assistance in resolving all difficulties, and they expect things to be done quickly. These requests are not excessive, but they already cause headaches for the local authorities, not to mention that the main work of politics is not limited to this.

Northern Jiangsu is a special area. The Communist Party uses it as a testing ground for their political theories. Therefore, the political struggle is even more acute. Organizing and training the people and winning over the people are the two most important tasks. The people of Northern Jiangsu hate the Communist Party intensely. Grasping this sentiment of the people and using it effectively would be enough to prevent the Communist Party from gaining a foothold. But all of this seems to be undone, or done very little, and done poorly.

--Are those who have fled to be left to fend for themselves? Are those who have not fled to be left to groan under the tyrannical power of the Communist forces?

The Communist Party, having lost the hearts of the people, is actively engaged in political "struggle" using all means of threats and inducements.

Full of Learning, How to Implement?

"Politics cannot keep up with the military" is an old saying that has become outdated, but it still applies completely, showing the heaviness of the diseased state. A county-level administrative official's direct relationship with the people is far more important than simply issuing policy statements. However, the salary of today's county-level administrative officials is several times worse than that of the already meager provincial-level civil servants. A county magistrate's new salary is 120,000 yuan. The rest can be imagined. Without money, it is like a machine without oil; what effect can it have?

Under such circumstances, those who want to do things are full of learning, but how can they implement it? According to regulations, out of the fifteen million yuan reconstruction funds, only five million yuan can be used before returning to the county, leaving ten million yuan to be used after returning. Not enough—of course not enough—and the instructions from above are to find solutions on the spot. But squeezing oil from an oil-depleted seed is likely a dangerous thing. Military operations are underway, and the exiled people are happy that their return home is scheduled, but the exiled county magistrates are heavy-hearted. "Politics cannot keep up with the military" has been said a thousand times. Are we going to let the impatient armed brothers stomp their feet?

### The Philippines in the Rainy Season: Manila, July 28 (Airmail)

— Special Correspondent of the Central News Agency, Xing Guangzu

After touring the entire city of Manila, you will see many magnificent buildings, bustling urban areas, shopping centers filled with fashionable ladies, and glittering nightclubs. These many 20th-century modern embellishments have transformed the capital of Manila into a splendid city, praised as the "Pearl of the Orient." However, no one can deny that hidden beneath this embossed glory are darkness, poverty, depravity, vulgarity, chaos, and the seven deadly sins, which seem eternally difficult to wash away. Upon closer observation, you can see that the economy of the entire island nation is nothing more than a gaunt and skeletal framework.

This young republic seems too young. It is shrouded in a layer of darkness in politics, economics, and many other aspects, and needs someone like Prometheus who can bring some light and warmth. I believe, as do many others, that it can only rely on the United States—the grantor of its independence.

Everything in the Philippines during the rainy season gives people a strange feeling, like a dream, like depression.

For several days, it has been raining incessantly. The entire city street is flooded with rainwater, and the rain continues to fall. The rain in this island nation is different from what we have in our country. The drizzle of spring can embellish the beauty of the Jiangnan scenery, but it is certainly not like the rain in this island nation. The rain here has a kind of brute force. It comes suddenly. It never drifts gently in a few drops, nor is it just a torrential downpour. Instead, it pours straight down like the sea overturning. That kind of unforgiving appearance is frightening. You feel the ferocity of the primitive forces of nature. You suspect whether the demons of heaven are wreaking havoc. The strings of large raindrops, the long, straight legs of the rain, hit the exposed, rusty tin roofs wildly. You hide in the spacious house. You can't talk because the soft sound of human voice is completely drowned out by the raging sound of rain. At this time, you want to shout, because only shouting can make you feel your own existence. Sometimes you feel helpless. Your whole body seems to be useless and without strength…

This time I leaned against the window railing, looking at the glittering Manila cityscape through the glass curtain of rain, and I was truly worried.

### A Few Suggestions Regarding Textbook Publishing

— Critical Words

The summer vacation is over, and schools are about to start. In addition to being busy applying to schools, urging their parents to quickly arrange tuition fees, or handling loan applications themselves, students face another challenge: buying textbooks. Some educators advocate abolishing textbooks altogether, but we believe this is an extreme view. Textbooks are also one of the tools of education. However, regarding the current textbooks, we believe there are a few principles that should be proposed and discussed with the publishing industry in advance.

First, we feel that the quality of the paper used for current textbooks, especially elementary school textbooks, is too poor. This was excusable during wartime because we had to conserve resources. However, in this era of prioritizing education and construction, we can no longer sacrifice children's eyesight and aesthetic appreciation by scrimping on paper. Moreover, it is not necessarily cost-effective economically, because a child may use a textbook for less than a month before it is already tattered. Soon they will need to buy a second one.

Second, in terms of distribution, we hope it will be as widespread as possible. Last semester, schools had to pre-order textbooks, as if they were rationed. We hear that this situation may occur again this year. Last semester, when buying textbooks, we discovered a black market. In some bookstores, you could not buy a book unless you paid a considerable premium. We hope that this phenomenon will not occur this semester. The solution is to increase the number of copies printed and allow all bookstores to sell them.

Third, in terms of price, we must not raise prices. In previous years, we have seen a phenomenon where, before the start of the school year, bookstores suddenly hoarded many of the more popular and commonly used books in schools. After a week or two, these books would reappear, but the price would have increased by several hundred percent. Now, a significant amount of foreign paper is being imported, and the original price is also reasonable. We hope that bookstore owners will not use the excuse of extended foreign exchange rates to inflate book prices.

Textbooks are one of the main tools for popularizing education. This is a major task in spiritual construction. Therefore, we hope that the gentlemen in the publishing industry can plan a more appropriate solution for this matter. This will not only benefit students but also contribute to the country and society.

### The Cliff

— Lu Qing

(I)

The value of a work can certainly be determined by the extent to which it influences and guides life. However, to faithfully critique a work, the focus of the critique must change according to the differences in its subject matter; because different contents will inevitably have different influences and guidance on life.

*The Iron Flood*, *Chapayev*, or *The Jungle*, are considered satisfactory works by most people. This is because the former fully explains the power of the masses and the need for group life, and paves a path with hope and struggle; the latter profoundly describes the suffering of life, revealing the layer of fantasy about happiness that covers the real lives of people. In their different subjects, they (*The Iron Flood*, *Chapayev*, and *The Jungle*) all exerted the power to influence life and reaped the effect of guiding life; therefore, they all have the true value of being critiqued. And if we further demand to judge their relative merits, I say this is a foolish idea; the reason is very simple: a majestic choral piece and a sorrowful solo piece cannot be compared at all, because although both are music and have many of the same qualities, the different forms and different emotions of the two are enough to completely negate the accuracy of the comparison.

Therefore, in terms of the interpretation of temperament, and in terms of the inspiration of passion and reason, I dare not believe that *The Precipice* is a successful work.

The translator of the Chinese version, Li Lin, tells us that the author Goncharov was a Russian writer who, in the history of Russian literature, was only later than Turgenev and Tolstoy. Besides *The Precipice*, he only wrote two novels: *An Ordinary Story* and *Oblomov*. *Oblomov* gained a great reputation. Kropotkin said in *Ideals and Realities in Russian Literature* that it, along with Turgenev's *Fathers and Sons*, Tolstoy's *War and Peace*, and *Resurrection*, were the most successful works of the second half of the nineteenth century.

Similarly, in *The Precipice*, the author also revealed a delicate style of writing, and more importantly, the author used his best efforts to depict the original form of "passion", and also used his best efforts to describe the situation where reason was buried deep in the "precipice".

(II)

This was the era of Imperial Russia, when a few people possessed wealth, servants, and land. Raisky: the sole heir of a noble family; he had no brothers or sisters, and even his parents had died long ago. Therefore, his great-aunt raised him and managed all the property he was supposed to inherit. Raisky spent his childhood here. He did not often stay with his great-aunt or cousins, but preferred to walk alone along the Volga River or in the spring countryside; this kind of life created a calm and solitary personality. Gradually, he developed a love for art and literature. Afterwards, he went to Moscow and lived a decadent life for more than ten years, finally returning to his home by the Volga River in the summer of the year he graduated from university. Now his two cousins have grown up and become very beautiful. So he settled down, and in his daily social life he met some of the nearby nobles, and also met Mark – a political prisoner who had been exiled for the second time by the government.

What a dangerous monster Mark was. However, one day when he was secretly eating apples in Raisky's garden, he was seen by Raisky's eldest cousin, Vera. After a few questions and answers, they were both impressed by each other's bold ideas and extensive knowledge. Afterwards, they associated and discussed secretly. But Raisky didn't know any of this, and no one else did either. In Raisky's eyes, Vera was the pearl of this area, possessing unparalleled beauty and wisdom; she was an ember, full of darkness and shining mystery, and even more like the night, full of charm. This charm attracted Raisky, making him unable to leave her side. Vera felt the pain of being spied on and felt extremely unfree. She began to be annoyed with her cousin and made clear hints – which made Raisky taste the frustration of falling in love. He was very eager to find out what secrets Vera was keeping in her heart; he discovered that Vera was receiving and reading blue letters sealed with sealing wax, and he discovered that Vera was coming and going unpredictably and was mentally distracted. Therefore, his suspicion and unease gradually deepened; he once clearly asked his great-aunt what Vera's true nature was? He was also anxiously trying to learn the reason for Vera's change in attitude "She has been very pensive for some time now, have you noticed? Could she be in love"? However, this distraction was futile, and Vera became even more pensive and profound.

At the end of this territory, there was a cliff that descended to the Volga River. The cliff was covered with wild grass and bushes, and a small path stretched from the middle of the trees to the bottom of the cliff. There was an old pavilion there and the tomb of a person who committed suicide for love. There was also a terrible legend, so people would not go there without reason. Mark and Vera chose this place as a meeting place; they used gunshots as a signal.

Vera had read the works of Voltaire and Proudhon, and had a rebellious view of the entire world; her heart was filled with various different explanations – for society, property, and even life. Therefore, she believed in Mark, because in the darkness, Mark was the first to light a lamp for her, indicating a new path.

For many days, Mark had not used gunshots to summon Vera. They had been very interested in getting together, but now they were separated again because of being too faithful to their ideals. For Vera, this was tantamount to the loss of life; she was very depressed and gradually accepted Raisky's comfort and respected Raisky's sympathy. Involuntarily, she told him about the grievances in her heart and confessed her actions in front of Raisky. In this way, Vera relied on Raisky's comfort and religious devotion to spend the painful days in the early stage of suddenly breaking up with Mark, thinking that she would slowly be able to free herself from her contradictory state of mind and return to a peaceful life. However, on the evening of the seventh day, a gunshot suddenly came from the cliff. A wound that was about to heal was deeply stabbed again: freedom, love, happiness, strength, Vera remembered everything. However, she immediately hesitated: if she went, Mark was a most stubborn man, what would there be besides arguing and breaking up? If she didn't go, Vera really didn't have this strength, she understood that she was a lamb in a sea of suffering, needing both water and milk. In her heart, passion and reason began to clearly oppose and fight each other. Finally, she ran to the cliff regardless of everything, while Raisky stretched out his obstructing hand at the end of the road like a statue, and the second gunshot was heard again. Raisky felt that he was rescuing a woman who was about to be swallowed by passion. He warned Vera with the voice of reason that the cliff was not a place to stay: "This road is too steep, you will fall again." He rebuked Vera with the voice of reason to go back. However, nothing worked, and after the third gunshot, Raisky had to allow Vera to walk down the cliff step by step.

Raisky saw all of this. He suddenly hated anyone other than himself in his heart, and he began to have extreme contempt and hatred for Vera. But after a short time, he became sympathetic to Vera again. Because driven by passion, human nature is inherently unstable; moreover, Vera was already trapped in severe self-condemnation and pain! Raisky confessed everything about his guilt to Vera very shamefully and advised Vera to let her grandmother know about these things. This was a very touching scene of mutual trust and mutual understanding. Vera blamed herself and did not blame anyone else, becoming very quiet. She also told a very close friend, Dus, about the facts, saying with a tone of repentance: "Your pure Vera has been buried deep in that cliff." She no longer kept secrets in her heart, thus gaining full sympathy to resist the pain left by the passion in her heart.

Mark wrote to Vera again, proposing to live together from now on, but Vera had already burned her fingers and dared not hold this flame a second time – although the flame still looked beautiful.

Autumn came, and like waking up from a big dream, Raisky began to think about his wandering life again, crossing the Alps. From afar, he missed his life by the Volga River; he missed his great-aunt Tatyana, and he also missed the poor Vera who was destroyed by passion.

(III)

Here, the entire story is centered on Vera, and from every smiling face and every contemplation of Vera, the author has arranged the supreme contradiction and struggle between passion and reason. The background of the story has not changed: a corner of Russia's tranquil land. The Volga River flows quietly, sparkling with white waves, flowing through green fields and groves on both banks; here is Raisky's territory, a beautiful garden, but outside this area, the author has pre-arranged a man-eating cliff.

Vera is not accustomed to the luxury of life, she has spiritual wisdom; this spiritual wisdom drives her to pursue an impossible ideal life, and hopeless pursuit finally creates her gloomy and distressed fate. She has a strong desire for knowledge, so she collects many new knowledge; this knowledge contributes to her dissatisfaction with real life, and real life still restricts her: Vera's distress is formed in this way. Now we understand that it should be very natural for Vera to know and love Mark. However, Vera is like a thirsty lamb, she only knows that Mark has water in his hand, but does not consider whether this water can be used as a drink. When she uses her wisdom and experience to determine the quality of the water, oh my God – passion has already tied her and Mark together! Raisky discovered these things, but Raisky was too ordinary to pull back this passion-bewildered cousin. "I warned you, Vera. I said passion is a fierce wolf." But what's the use? Vera's voice is a patient's plea: "Help me to live. Give me that beautiful passion that shines with glory and illuminates the whole of life." And: "It's too late for me to stop going to the cliff now"!

Passion, yes – is a fierce wolf! Vera escaped its fierce bite, who can escape its fierce bite? Every time I finish reading *The Precipice*, I think so. Opening up my diary from the past three years, I clearly remember the suffering that passion has left me; "*Interrupted Strings*", "*Pagoda*", "*Spring Breeze is Easy*", and "*Requiem*"; let's not talk about it! I now contain a heart full of shame and sorrow, every time I reread my old works. Passion drove me to walk on an uneven mountain road, falling and getting up again, and now I find that at the age of twenty, I already have the gloomy and sorrowful state of mind of an eighty-year-old man.

I admit that I am in the various contradictions and conflicts of adolescence, and passion has a great dominance over me. I once blindly hated and loved everything, and I also suddenly cried when I was laughing. *The Precipice*, after all, told me – a tragic story – with a mother's loving contempt. It clearly painted a fierce wolf in front of me, and in the wolf's mouth, it snatched a bitten heart with blood: I recognized that this was Vera's, and it was also mine! But Vera was sacrificed because Raisky did not thoroughly save her; I am happy because *The Precipice* has powerfully indicated the destination of my passion.

*The Precipice*, is it not a beacon in the night for a young person with weak rational judgment?

### After Reading "Education and Life"

— Zhu Jiaqing

Author: Yu Jiaju, Publisher: Zhengzhong Book Company

In the preface to his book, Mr. Yu very sincerely told us that he was once a student of Dr. Dewey. Therefore, although the backbone of the whole book cites many Confucian classics and terms, it still expresses the "Natural Empiricism" color system. It seems that the above two sentences are the most pertinent. Even when discussing "development", it is completely based on Dr. Dewey's explanation; Dr. Dewey divides the development of personality into three stages: (1) biological (instinctive), (2) social (customary), and (3) rational (critical); and Mr. Yu also divides it into three stages: (1) material self, (2) social self, and (3) spiritual self. (See Dr. Dewey's writings (1) “Ethics”. (2) “How we Think”)

As for discussing the possibility of education, it is also similar to Dr. Dewey's opinion. Dr. Dewey explains the possibility of education as "Immaturity"; at the same time, this immaturity has two meanings: (1) dependence, and (2) plasticity. (See Dr. Dewey's Democracy and Education) Mr. Yu then combines "immaturity" and "dependence" into one concept, calling it "upwardness". In fact, because it is immature and needs to rely on, it can move upward. Therefore, this is just a difference in terminology.

However, in addition to expounding the natural empirical educational thought system, Mr. Yu also particularly emphasized the aspect of "will" and "belief". This kind of thought happens to coincide with Nietzsche's philosophical thought. Because Nietzsche inherited Kant's theory on the one hand, and deeply understood the mysteries of idealism. On the other hand, he was truly a disciple of Darwin, vigorously advocating "superman"ism; advocating the survival of the fittest and natural selection, at the same time, Mr. Yu in many parts of this book, explained the importance of faith, even more than knowledge. The environment in which human beings live is complex and constantly changing; if we use limited knowledge to deal with this unlimited environment, we will often feel that it is not enough. Therefore, we can only rely on faith and will. Of course, in this way, we should emphasize the importance of motivation and action.

Mr. Yu also advocates extreme respect for the law; this is also consistent with Hegel's thought. At the same time, he believes that those who can be called "perfect" or "superman" are probably only the "nation". Therefore, he once said in this book: "The nation is the highest judge, guide, and developer of national culture".

### Several History Books on World War II

— Hua

Regarding the history of World War II, there are probably only a few books available now. Among those published domestically, there is *The History of World War II* by Chu Yukun, published by Shanghai Yongxiang Book Company in April of this year. The author said in the preface: "I started collecting materials from the day the European War broke out on September 1, 1939, and it took eight years to write this book." He also said: "Most of the books on international issues are translations. I am determined to set a precedent for our writing community." But he also frankly pointed out two shortcomings: (1) "After the outbreak of the Pacific War, it was almost impossible to obtain real news, so I decided to focus the content of this book on Europe, and omit the Far East and the Pacific. I plan to write a separate book on this topic." (2) The ending of the war is not as detailed as the outbreak of the war, because the enemy took away all the materials I had collected, and I had to finish the second half of the book hastily.

The whole book is divided into twelve chapters and three hundred and seven pages, with the full text of the United Nations Charter as an appendix.

The second one is *World War II: A Concise History* by Roger W. Shugg Ph. D. and Major H. A. DeWeerd, published in Washington, The Infantry Journal, 1946. This is a brief military history. In terms of records, the authors said that they strived for accuracy. From this book, we can find out when and where many battles took place and how they unfolded. At the same time, the authors also stated that they did not bury the contributions of the Allied countries to this war, although the United States occupied a very important position.

This book was originally compiled for American soldiers, but the writing is not "specialized" and can be used for public reading and reference. The whole book has five hundred and thirty-eight pages, with forty-four maps attached, which is very convenient for checking.

The next one is *The Secret History of the War* by Waverley Root, published last year in New York, Charles Sribner's Sons, New York, 1945. The whole book consists of two volumes. There is another volume, entitled *Casablanca to Katyn: the Secret History of the War*, which is considered the third volume, but its nature is independent.

The author's attitude is fair, and his ability is strong. He seeks many undiscovered factors and facts behind the scenes of the war. The scope of this book is not limited to one battlefield, one battle, one or several warring countries. There are many political actions, propaganda efforts, diplomatic compromises, and tactical errors, which are written in their original form, which simply makes people feel a little unhappy, and even dare not believe it.

The author is a journalist and has worked in various places since 1927. The materials in the book are mostly collected in Europe. It is said that the inside story tries to avoid emotional effects and seeks to be faithful.

The next one is *History of World War II*, edited by Francis Trevelyan Miller litt. D., LL. D. When writing this book, there was also a specialized historical and military editorial department, the Board of Historical and Military Authorities, whose members were Dr. Curt L. Heymann, a specialist in studying the history of Axis attacks on the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Greece, and the Balkan Peninsula, Benedict Fitzpartrick, a specialist in studying Britain, Karl Burger, a specialist in studying Central European issues, Charles Lam Markmann, a specialist in studying the Allied counterattacks in France, North Africa, Italy, and Germany, Victor H. Lawn, a specialist in studying the battles in the Far East, China, India, and the Philippines, Crerar Harris, a specialist in studying Soviet politics and military affairs, Werner Loeb, a specialist in studying German Nazis and youth movements. The whole book has nine hundred and sixty-six pages, with various photos, maps, important documents, etc. The editor said in the preface that he hopes this book can become a "standard" work.

The editor pointed out that this war resulted in the death and injury of 20 million people, the displacement of 30 million people, and the massacre of 10 million people. The cost of financial resources is estimated at about 1,000,000,000,000 US dollars. Therefore, we have to analyze its causes and describe its results so that the same tragedy will not happen again in the future.

### The Hermit's Beard

— Zhu Li

Written by He Yi, Published by Shaonian Publishing House

He Yi is an excellent children's literature writer. His works possess the qualities of dissecting reality and expressing human nature, as well as rich interest and descriptions in a child's tone. He provides children with fulfilling appreciation and sound education. Today, when generally precocious erotic stories and tales of gods and monsters are anesthetizing and stimulating immature minds, how eagerly we await some beneficial children's books! He Yi's published works include the following:

### True Stories (short story collection)

### Arch of Triumph (novel)

### The Hermit's Beard (short story collection)

### Wooden Man (novel)

### Wild Imp (novel)

### Snowman (short story collection)

### Golden Bell (novel)

### Children's Country (novel)

### Wild Whirlwind's Fairy Tales (short story collection)

### Riding the Clouds and Mist (long science story)

### Two Brothers (novel)

### Hell (novel)

### Children's Bridge (short story collection)

Within these collections, we have not discovered a single work that has a negative influence on children. The era of children's literature that induced children to worship power, worship gold, and be superstitious about luck has passed.

"The Hermit's Beard" collection contains nine short stories: "The Hermit's Beard," "The Story of the Mirror," "The Scientist," "Two Giants and the Great Wild Boar," "Heart to Heart Bazaar," "Baldy," "The Poet and His Son," "The Bee Kingdom," and "Three Questions." These works were created when the Eastern invaders were stationing troops on the East Asian plains, and when the general populace was awakening to the need to live by their own will. These works reflect this era.

In the short story "The Hermit's Beard," the author uses a light touch to describe a hermit who wants to escape reality and the enemy, wanting to hide in a large forest. But reality is, after all, reality; one cannot live without eating or wearing clothes. So the hermit runs to the town, encounters the enemy, and becomes a compliant citizen, a coolie for the enemy. His beautiful beard is cut off and woven into a fine rope tied around his neck, leading him along for the enemy.

In "Two Giants and the Great Wild Boar" in the same collection, the author uses an extraordinary style to describe how the poor people are awakened and how they learn to resist. One giant is a symbol of the poor people's consciousness of resistance, and the other giant is a representative of the rich and powerful. These are two opposing forces at work. As the two giants fight, a great wild boar with ointment marks on its head invades. So the two giants join hands to jointly resist this wild boar, defeat it, and then work together to build many new things.

From these two examples alone, we can already understand the author's intention: the author satirizes backwardness and obedience, and points out the power of unity and resistance. What kind of influence will this have on children's small minds?

Some people think that things written for children to read must have a bit of romantic interest. Fairies and princes can lead children into fantasy, and magical adventures can keep children engrossed. But this is not necessarily the case. Realistic fairy tale themes, as long as they are handled well, can certainly attract children to read. The reading material we give to children is not just for their amusement, but for their education. Children are just like adults; they are people with flesh and blood. They also grow up in this world!

He Yi's efforts in this regard are worthy of our admiration.

Spring and Autumn

### Music and National Boundaries

— Zhu Lixing

"A nation that has not produced great composers still has the right to appreciate and even understand music. The reason is that music itself is the least likely of all the arts in the world to have national boundaries. Every member of the Germanic nation can be proud of the great musicians that their nation has produced throughout history, but we non-Germanic people can respect their glory for this reason, so why should we harbor a sense of inferiority and make the mistake of discrimination, which has no national boundaries in art itself, get deeper and deeper! I say this is a great mistake, we should not have such prejudice, because music itself is the least likely of any art in the world to have national boundaries!" Alezandre Padereski, in his private notes on music, especially highlighted this excerpt from a brief "address" before a grand symphony concert on a certain date, and repeated it twice. No one can deny that he is the only piano virtuoso after Chopin, and he devoted his life to studying Beethoven's Sonata, attaining its essence and creating his own unique style, becoming a great composer. At the same time, on the international political stage, he was the Prime Minister of Poland shortly after the First World War, and later became the President of the country from Prime Minister. He can be said to be one of the most respected and talented figures in the world in the early years of this century. However, for Germany, the pillar country of the Germanic nation that emerged from Poland due to defeat, he still abandoned the political prejudices that are inevitable and praised the great musicians that the Germanic nation has produced throughout history. He sincerely expressed his utmost admiration.

Throughout history, in fact, today, whoever wants to compile a history of music, let alone if you have no bias, even if you stubbornly cling to "bias", I think you can only do some "unfinished" collection, otherwise you will inevitably be difficult to move an inch! From the 16th century to today, 85% of the great composers who deserve to be called immortal come from Germany and Austria of the Germanic nation. The Teutonic nation accounts for only 3%, and the Slavic nation, far north of the Black Sea, accounts for only 5%. The Roman nation accounts for 7%, as for the Asian nation, it can simply be said to be 0%. Some Chinese even feel that listening to these things is like suffering a kind of punishment. Probably, even if you ask him to study or appreciate it, he still "can't grasp the main points," so where is there any inferiority complex and discriminatory mentality born out of jealousy.

Leaving politics aside, Hitler vigorously publicized the musical talents and great composers that their nation has produced throughout history. Of course, besides asking ourselves if we recognize that we are not as good, shouldn't we think that it is something to be proud of? In fact, great composers who can be called immortal are indeed 85% from their nation. Since three centuries and one leaf, composers of the Germanic nation have always been the main pillars of music history. Over the past two hundred years, they have cultivated the foundation for us to appreciate and study in the future. Tracing back to the source, who can depreciate their "pride"? And who can not ask themselves if they recognize that they are not as good?

Since Johann Sebastien Bach, the excellence of any country to the Germanic nation's contribution to the history of human music has long been established. By the middle of the 19th century, Richard Wagner's bold and vigorous "revival" simply amplified the brilliance of the excellence that the Germanic nation has contributed to the history of human music throughout the ages. At this time, not only could no one depreciate their "pride", not only could no one not ask themselves if they recognized that they were not as good, but everyone applauded and surrendered, but it was also because of this that the national boundaries in music were finally erased. Because of this, the brilliance of music can be immortalized.

As Padereski said: "Music itself is the least likely of any art in the world to have national boundaries!" The people of the world who admire music should remove inferiority, abandon prejudice, and move forward on the road of music!

Author's note: This manuscript was originally written in French and published in the January issue of the Paris Music Magazine in 1939. This is written with reference to the original text.

### A Letter Draft

— Zhongyuan

In my drawer, there is a letter draft hidden. It is a small piece of grayish-yellow paper, with a few lines of small fountain pen handwriting on it, the handwriting is scribbled and blurred, revised and revised again; but I love this letter draft, cherish this letter draft; I have carefully preserved it for four years.

That was in January 1942. On the day the Pacific War broke out, my father, who was ill, was arrested by the local Japanese military police because he was a pastor of an American church, and was detained for more than six weeks without being released. All the methods had been exhausted, all the connections had been tried, but they were always ineffective. Finally, in desperation, one night, I listened to the advice of a few friends and tried to write a letter to the military police captain myself, hoping to arouse a little of his conscience and release my sick father. This grayish-yellow piece of paper is the draft of that letter I wrote.

Later, my father was released. Of course, I don't know if it was the merit of that letter, but in my heart, I had no hesitation in feeling that I had done a heroic deed of saving my father with both wisdom and courage. From then on, I regarded the draft of that letter as precious, wrapped it in a handkerchief, carefully hid it in the drawer, patted my chest, and said to myself triumphantly:

One day, I will take this letter draft out for everyone to see! One day, I will tell all my friends who have returned from the rear about this! One day, I will tell everyone how I suppressed my grief and indignation, endured the humiliation, and waved my trembling pen when I wrote this letter that night... One day...

One day... Yes, my expectations were too high, I caressed the letter draft and waited eagerly!

I was not disappointed, "that day" finally came. Friends from afar returned one by one.

The first to see me was Sufang, who came from Chengdu and strode into my room with vigor. I jumped up excitedly and grabbed her hand and said, "Sufang! You've made me wait so hard, I have something to tell you!... " As I said this, I was about to pull open the drawer to take out the letter draft for her to see, but unexpectedly she stopped me with a shout:

"Don't rush! First, look at what's changed on my arm?" She said very quickly and loudly, almost stretching a wind-swept jade arm straight to my brow. I had to patiently look at her arm and replied, "There's nothing changed, but it seems like there's this scar..."

"That's exactly this scar!" Her voice, both urgent and loud, immediately rushed up: "This scar, ah, do you know the origin of this scar? Did you see the news about me published in the ×× newspaper four years ago?..."

It's really amazing! Sufang, who has always been very gentle and calm, has become an impassioned orator after eight years of absence. She gestured and talked about how, when she arrived in the inland, she was willing to sacrifice her superior head nurse position in the hospital to join the air defense rescue team; how she risked danger countless times to rescue thousands and hundreds of injured compatriots; how, in a major bombing four years ago, she ran back and forth in the flames and shrapnel, and finally got injured herself, falling to the ground, blood gurgling out. Then, how she was carried into the hospital by her colleagues, how she was commended by the commander-in-chief, how her name was published in the ×× newspaper that day, and how this permanent memorial, this scar, was left on her arm!...

She spoke excitedly, repeating it over and over again. By the time she finished speaking, it was already dark.

It was dark, so I had to put down the hand that was grabbing the drawer and sent Sufang away.

I was not disappointed, I knew there were other friends who would come, I was waiting.

Sure enough, the second friend came from afar! It was Xiazhen, who was already married.

Like a warm spring breeze blowing in, the radiant glow of Xiazhen's face appeared at my doorway, and my silent room suddenly became lively and energetic.

As usual, I smiled, shook hands, and asked a few words about the hardships of the journey. My hand reached to the side of the drawer again, ready to take out the letter draft that had been treasured for four years.

However, before my hand could grab the drawer, a fragrant thing had been stuffed into the palm of my hand.

The fragrant thing was a beautiful foreign envelope, with a six-inch photo inside. In the photo, there was an airplane, and several noble women were standing in front of the airplane, including Lingzhen.

"Oh, look at this photo, this was taken at the ×× airport the year before last when I was working in the Women's Association in × place and went with several colleagues to welcome Mrs. ×..."

This beautiful young lady, from the photo to the Women's Association, from the Women's Association to Mrs. ×, from Mrs. × to the × important person, from the × important person to her husband, from her husband to a certain magazine, from a certain magazine to her shocking article... it was like the Yellow River bursting its banks, unstoppable.

It was getting dark again, so I asked her to come and talk again the next day because I also wanted to tell her something, but she said; "I can't come! I'm back to see my parents! I'm going back to Shanghai the day after tomorrow, because she's waiting for me in Shanghai to fly to ×× together."

Xiazhen left, and I was a little disappointed. But I was still not disappointed, I knew that there would definitely be other friends who would come to see me.

Yes, other friends came. It was a young man of twenty!

I welcomed this young man with a joyful mood. He was my student from five years ago, a smart and honest child. He did not come from the distant rear, but from the remote mountainous areas of the western countryside.

This time I thought I could finally achieve my wish. I greeted the young man with a smile, and excitedly reached out to open my drawer, but it was terrible!

"Teacher! Teacher - let me tell you! Now I've fired a rifle, a machine gun, a small cannon, a cannon... everything!" As soon as the young man sat down, he kept telling me: "Let me tell you, once when the enemy came to attack Fire Mountain, our troops had just been transferred away and there were only a few people left, so hundreds of students from our school temporarily filled the ranks. At that time, I didn't know how to shoot a gun, so I desperately threw hand grenades at the enemy, and as a result, I killed more than a dozen enemies. Another time..."

By the time the young man finished his achievements in killing the enemy, it was getting dark again. So I withdrew the hand that was preparing to open the drawer again and sent him away.

I was finally a little disappointed.

Now, I still keep that draft. I still love it and cherish it, but I no longer want to take it out for anyone to see, because I know that everyone has a story in their stomach that is greater than mine.

### The Mysterious Door

— Cangmin

In front of the window of my dwelling, there is a mottled yellow earth wall, no more than four feet away from the window. Therefore, my room is so dark.

Whenever I am tired of reading or in a bad mood, I like to look out of the window, hoping that the window can bring me something. However, now all I can see is the cracks in the yellow earth (it is said that romantic painters can see pictures from this, but I cannot), and the scattered tiles embedded in the soil. Outside the window is a deep lane with no sound.

Every time I look out, all I get is loneliness, loneliness, how unbearable loneliness!

Is the world outside the window really a world of loneliness?

No, I don't think so. On the contrary, it should be a vast world, with countless people struggling and calling out, but this world is completely obscured by this wall.

I stared at the wall outside the window, thinking with the wisdom that God has given to mankind, for a long, long time. The room was incomparably quiet. I lay on the table, letting the breeze flutter my disheveled hair. Suddenly, the wall swayed, and it had a faint sound. Then, a door flashed out from the wall, and a curtain of transparent crystal beads was hanging on the door. From the outside, one could clearly see the scene inside: it seemed like a large room, or like in the wilderness. There were so many people, men, women, old, and young. Their faces were all synonymous with pale, pain, horror, and eyes burned by unbearable hunger. Some were running on the dilapidated road with burdens and children on their backs, and some were sitting on the field sighing. The most touching thing was a woman kneeling on the ground, in front of her was a sick child (seeming like a wounded bird lying motionless), she choked with sobs, stroking her beloved child's pale cheeks with a motherly hand. And behind her was fire, and the sky was filled with the most beautiful colors of the sunset glow, and the arcs drawn by the falling bullets like shooting stars...

I stared at it, motionless for a long time, and that mysterious door was suddenly closed by an unknown force. Now, what is in front of my eyes is still a mottled yellow earth wall.

I sat in front of the window in amazement and tried to understand its entire meaning.

However, I cannot understand this dreamlike image, I only feel that a small insect is crawling in my heart, it makes me feel depressed and painful.

Now my room has returned to its previous quietness, but loneliness has also come from every corner, making people feel the pain of loneliness and suffocation.

May God open this mysterious door again and show me more different things:

### Small Mountain

— Jingxing

People who have never climbed high mountains and steep ridges are not easy to appreciate the beauty of small mountains, just like a person who lives in a tall building in a city does not understand the structure of a simple thatched hut.

A tall mountain is like a strong woman, with fat buttocks and towering breasts, thick arms and round thighs, everything seems to be rough-lined. A small mountain is different from this, she is like a quiet, lazy girl, secretly peeking at everything nearby with shy eyes.

High mountains use cliffs, peaks, precipices, and deep abysses to create a terrifying picture, as if they want to devour the world. Small mountains do not have these daunting situations, she quietly lies flat on the ground, willingly enduring the trampling of all animals, as docile as a gentle sheep.

On rainy days, a thin veil of smoke envelops her, and the mountain peaks float faintly in the clouds of varying shades, often a trace of mysterious beauty flashes through one's mind. When the clear weather unfolds, the small mountain is clearly exposed in front of people again, a blade of grass, a tree, happily looks at the surroundings in the bright sunlight. At this time, the small mountain shows a calm, harmonious, noble, and gentle atmosphere, such as all the oriental sentiments possessed by a typical oriental girl.

Cloudy days add a more beautiful color to the small mountain. In front of the gray sky, the distance between the small mountain and me seems to be closer, and the edges and corners of a stone can be seen more clearly by me. At this time, she is completely like a girl in love, gazing at the world with a melancholy, sad, worried expression and yet charmingly.

I love the small mountain, I love her ordinariness, I love her gentleness and docility, and I love even more that she does not have the danger of big mountains - like all the dangers in a dark society.

I love the small mountain, I love her shyness and gentleness, I love her selflessness and frankness. Regardless of sunny days, cloudy days, or rainy days, the small mountain always gives people a kind feeling.

### Dusk

— Susan

The sunset glow on the horizon constitutes a pattern of blue, yellow, black, and white streaks, and the colorfulness in front of me cannot help but re-ignite the illusions in my heart. However, the once-glossy forehead has added many wrinkles. Looking back at the hazy path, and counting where the end is, standing still - I have fallen into the illusion of nature again.

"Quack - quack - quack" A flock of geese sweeps across the sky, waking me up to the time I should return to my nest. "Birds are tired of flying and know to return home," but where is the end? A desolate wasteland, broken walls and ruins. Does a still-alive childlike heart want to listen to grandpa's "story of the child and the mermaid" again? It's harder than a dream, look, the fleeting clouds are making their thousands of layers of changes again.

Still have to pick up the staggering pace, walking my aimless journey, stepping out to the day of the end.

"Life - death"

"Cradle - grave" Why hesitate so much.

At that time you told me: "The heart used to be like an ancient well, but now it has waves again." What about now? Comparing your mood to an ancient battlefield, and comparing your emotions to the rivers and seas, can you give me your tears, I will thread them together with my needle and thread and hang them on my chest forever.

Darkness layers on layers, and I can no longer see the smiling dimples on the horizon. Groping forward, I call out your name all over the world.

### Alert (Selection of World Famous Paintings)

— Wen (1847-1910)

Shi · Collection of Glasgow Art Gallery

In terms of animal painting, Shi Wen can be called an unprecedented genius, unmatched by anyone. In his youth, he entered the Huasaite Art School, and at the age of twenty-seven he went to Paris to study painting and sculpture, and was deeply influenced by the Berreists. His famous works include "Dante and the Leopard", "Young Tiger of the Himalayas", "North" and so on. The painting "Alert" is extremely revealing of his outstanding genius.

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng 17

"I don't quite understand your meaning -- now there are only two paths; either return to your original defense area, or detour to Fengtai." The fellow's attitude gradually changed, and the true face of the "pig" gradually resurfaced.

"Let's consider it!" Little Tiger and I got out of the car one after the other. In the hazy glow of the car lights, I could only see the silhouettes of the two fellows retreating a few feet away; everything else was blurred.

"Please get in the car!" The two fellows had already drawn their guns. "On the battlefield, orders must be strictly obeyed."

"Then you have to listen to my orders!" I said, pulling out my gun with one hand and reaching out with the other, trying to pull Little Tiger behind me.

Before I could finish speaking, they both raised their guns and fired. I felt a sudden jolt in my body and stumbled sideways against the car body, landing right on the footboard of the car. My gun had slipped from my hand and I didn't know where it had flown.

A miracle also happened under the sound of the guns; Little Tiger, this thirteen-year-old child, I don't know when or with what agility, had already pounced forward; with just this one move, he had already knocked one down - precisely that half-cut tree stump-like pig - and rolled all the way, falling into the shadows. The remaining driver, however, holding a gun, followed Little Tiger, a monkey-like black shadow, shooting left and right. I only saw that black shadow flashing back and forth two or three times, and then suddenly leaped, his whole body like a cannonball, thrown at the driver, knocking the driver down. I only heard a grunt, and then neither of them moved. The whole process of these actions probably only took a few seconds.

"Uncle," Little Tiger, a small black lump-like shadow, squatted beside the fallen driver, quietly calling to me, "Are you hurt?" Then there was a flash of light from a flashlight. Under this light, it illuminated one person lying on the ground and another standing beside them searching.

I stood up, just about to warn Little Tiger about something, when I saw his searching shadow flash and run to a place more than ten feet away, and then turn on the flashlight again.

"All done, Uncle!"

"What happened?" I was somewhat doubtful and walked over.

"Look." He turned on the flashlight again, the light focused on the place where the pig lay fallen.

The scene illuminated by this round beam of light seemed to explain that the world is so big that many "believe it or not" events can happen; the deputy captain, or "pig," lay on his back on the ground, his gun gone, his limbs twitching slightly, blood flowing from the corner of his mouth, his mouth wide open, and his eyes bulging out, adding a bit more ferocious charm.

"Here!" Little Tiger knew I was searching for the location of his fatal strike, and tapped the fellow's neck with his toe. Looking at it this way was indeed a bit gruesome, because his entire throat had shifted position, as if something like a hook had hooked onto it and pulled it outward, the flesh of the throat swollen and hanging down in a two or three inch flap; pressing down on one corner of the collar of his shirt.

The driver was injured in the chest, and it also seemed like some kind of iron weapon had plunged straight through the clothes, with considerable depth.

### The Spirit of the Church

— Shao Fu

Of all the religions, Christianity's work, life, and behavior can be said to be the most engaged with the world. Christians do not seek to hide in the mountains and forests, nor do they meticulously seek personal afterlife. Although they have the goal of entering heaven, they believe that they must be humble, mournful, gentle, hunger and thirst for righteousness, merciful, pure in heart, peacemakers, and persecuted for righteousness; and their social view is unreserved love.

In the colorful and vibrant Shanghai, even in the most dirty and filthy places, a mission station is set up there, rain or shine, the doors open, and the Bible is taught on time. Even if there is only one listener, even if this one listener is not there wholeheartedly, but is there to rest and dodge the rain, the person on the platform is not bothered by it at all, and still eloquently expounds his ideas. Many people may think this is a urban irony, a cruel farce, but after a long time, you will naturally be inspired by his perseverance.

The church places service as its primary importance, because unlike the ordinary world of deception and competition for fame and profit, it often leads people to see it in reverse, thinking that their kind and harmonious attitude is hypocritical, or has some purpose, which seems quite sad, but this has no impact on them.

During the Anti-Japanese War, the church suffered great damage. After the victory, they started anew with renewed vigor. Many old foreign pastors and missionaries came out of concentration camps and returned to their original positions. For example, Mr. Bu Fangji, the president of St. John's University, at the age of ninety, is now preparing to return to Shanghai from the United States! This is something that a person who only plans for themselves cannot understand.

Sincerity, love, humility, service, perseverance -- this spirit of the church should be advocated even more in this chaotic social state where the world is surging and people forget righteousness for profit.

### In the Examination Hall

— Shi Pei

— A Proctor's Words

I felt proud and joyful when I walked out of the office with a red badge with the words "Proctor" pinned on my lapel!

I stepped into the classroom, and row upon row of dark heads were already filled with the incoming freshmen. Under the gaze of hundreds of anxious eyes, I stood on the platform with feigned authority and solemnly said to them:

"If the handwriting is illegible, you may ask within ten minutes after the exam papers are distributed. No other questions will be answered. No books or papers are allowed on the desks or chairs. Please pay attention!"

The exam papers were distributed, assisted by two friends who, like me, wore the "Proctor" badge. We stood at the front, middle, and back, and walked around from time to time. We were vigilant and scrutinized every tense face as if they contained hostility!

"Please note!" After walking around twice, I suddenly remembered, "Please take out your admission tickets!"

So, like examining something, the three of us squeezed through the narrow gaps between the seats, comparing each photo with their faces to see if they matched! I saw every face covered with sweat, tense and distressed. I suddenly felt an indescribable feeling. It seemed a little too cruel to these students who had endured the heat and sweated to take the exam! However, for the sake of the dignity and responsibility caused by this red badge, I had to check!

To be honest, the questions were so difficult that I dare say few of the freshmen could hope to pass. Look! Those anxious faces, frowning and sighing, perhaps the aspirations they had long cherished would be dashed because of this?

I clasped my hands behind my back and pretended to be relaxed, pacing from time to time. Sometimes, I felt several students' eyes sweep over me like lightning and then lower their heads in fear. What were they afraid of? I'm not a tiger, am I? If we were all studying in the same classroom, wouldn't we be classmates? Thinking of this, I sighed wearily, sat down lightly on the platform, lowered my head, and immersed myself in reverie!

Suddenly --

"How can you bring this?"

I raised my head and saw another "Proctor" shouting at a timid freshman like this, holding a booklet of lecture notes tightly in his hand!

A pleading, ashamed face did not elicit sympathy. The "Proctor" expressionlessly brought his exam paper over and placed it on the platform.

A distressed, flushed face walked past me dejectedly, tears glistening in the corners of his eyes!

Who made him like this? The school? The exam questions? Or the "Proctor"? As for the proctor, it was to fulfill their duty, but that cheating student was also pitiful!

In order to limit the number of students admitted, the exam standards have been raised especially, which is currently unavoidable for the school authorities, but the students are at a loss because of this, which is also sympathetic!

### Tuition Fees

— Chang Lin

Parent: "School is about to start, and I have no way to pay my children's tuition fees. I have no way to borrow money. What should I do?"

Merchant A: "Why worry so much? I'll lend it to you. The interest will be according to the market."

Parent: "The tuition fees are huge and difficult to bear. Can I repay the principal and interest together after my child graduates?"

Merchant A: "Compound interest calculation is fine..."

Merchant B: "Calculated at a rate of one point six fen per dollar, borrowing one million yuan, the total principal and interest after ten years will be 1,028,576,000,000 yuan."

Recalling Old Events

### Thinking of the Rong Case -- Shanghai Kidnapping Cases in the Past Twenty Years

— Zheng Fan

Rong case's main culprit Luo Wenqing, Yuan Zhongzhu and other eight people, was finally executed by the garrison headquarters.

Rong Desheng's kidnapping was the first major kidnapping case in Shanghai after the victory, with a ransom of 500,000 US dollars. It was eventually detected by Mao Sen, the second director of the First Pacification District Headquarters. The twists and turns of the case have been scattered in various newspapers. The Rong case leads people to generally recall several major kidnapping cases that occurred in Shanghai in the past.

The earliest was the kidnapping of Wei Tingrong, the son-in-law of Shanghai tycoon Zhu Bao San, followed by the kidnapping of Huang Boxian, the owner of the Times, both of which were spread throughout the streets and alleys as good material for chit-chat.

Later, there was the news of the kidnapping of Guanghua University President Zhang Shou Yong on Daxi Road. Zhang was then serving as the Deputy Minister of Finance. It was theoretically impossible to privately redeem the ransom, but Zhang was eager to save his son and finally redeemed him with a large sum of money. Therefore, the reports at that time were published vaguely, but there were still traces to be found.

About fifteen years ago, there was a period when kidnapping became very popular, and those with even a little property dared not go out alone. It is said that someone was walking on the road when suddenly kidnappers threatened them with guns. When they walked to the entrance of the Rising Sun Building on Nanjing Road, the person suddenly became desperate and urinated in their pants. The patrolmen intervened and twisted them to the patrol station, but they escaped danger because of this.

In 1940, Shanghai, which became an isolated island, became a world of terror. Kidnapping cases emerged endlessly. Famous examples include the kidnapping of Yue Ren Tang Li Shan, the husband of movie star Ruan Lingyu, in front of his apartment on Racecourse Road in November, and the kidnapping of Zhao Dianxiao, the son of Zhao Shuyong, a member of the "Central Political Committee" of the puppet regime. The kidnapping of Zhao's son had demanded 2 million yuan, but was later detected by the concession police in conjunction with the Japanese gendarmerie. The culprit was actually the "commander" of the puppet "Shanghai West Self-Defense Corps" at the time.

Among the kidnapping cases in 1941, the kidnapping of Jin Huating, the manager of the Shanghai Jiang Copper Factory (this Jin Huating is not the late famous reporter Jin Huating), and the kidnapping of Zhang Boju, the director of Yu Ye Bank, can be considered the "major ones". The most noteworthy was the kidnapping of Legislative Yuan member Luo Yunyan from his residence on Jisi Feier Road in Shanghai West by enemy troops. Luo had retired to Shanghai after the war and was enthusiastic about education. The purpose of kidnapping him was to coerce Luo to publish a "peace" communiqué in order to mobilize people. The despicable and shameless behavior of the Japanese army was infuriating!

Recently, after the Rong case, there was also the kidnapping case of Fujian sugar merchant Xue Jianqiu, which was solved within fourteen hours. The culprit, Zhang Yuchan, claimed to have served as the "Commander of the Zhejiang East Guerrilla." In this kidnapping, the ransom was paid at the police station, and the hostage was hidden in the city government. It was truly audacious and could be called "unprecedented," opening a new chapter!

### Wei Lihuang is About to Go Abroad

— You Fu

Character Sketch

General Wei Lihuang is about to go to the United States to inspect military affairs and study new tactics and new weapons. Many people have a deep memory of General Wei. Perhaps everyone will not forget Lihuang, the capital of Anhui Province during the war, but do you know its origin?

Thirteen years ago, Lihuang County was still an extremely barren town. At that time, tens of thousands of national troops fought over the town for more than a month, but they could not conquer it. Later, the highest authorities issued an emergency order, limiting them to capture it within a week. At the same time, whoever broke in first would have the town named as a county, and the county's name would be named after the commander of the troops that entered the area.

At that time, several division commanders received the order and held a meeting to plan the deployment of each route, but no one dared to go the most difficult route. As a result, General Wei volunteered and said, "I'll go--" Unexpectedly, he succeeded first. As a result, Anhui permanently had the city of Lihuang.

From then on, he became famous throughout the country, and his career flourished, from division commander to army commander. In August 1935, he was honorably appointed as the Commander of the Cleansing of the Four Provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui. In 1937, because Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was in distress in Xi'an, he made great achievements in handling the Xi'an Incident in Shaanxi, and Rong was awarded the first-class medal of the Army, Navy, and Air Force by the National Government.

When the Anti-Japanese War broke out, General Wei was stationed on the Jinan battlefield, commanding the various units of the First War Zone, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy, causing the Japanese invaders to be mired in the Central Plains battlefield and indirectly protecting the heart of the Great Northwest -- Xi'an.

In 1943, General Wei was transferred to Kunming, and then transferred to command the Expeditionary Force, fighting bloody battles on the India-Burma battlefield for more than three years; in the joint operations of the British and American allied forces, he commanded his troops, fully demonstrating the spirit of the Chinese army's war. All the Allied officers and soldiers who participated in the India-Burma campaign praised him for his detached and outstanding command.

Therefore, he also received the Medal of Honor from the American authorities.

General Wei admires two people in his life, one is the Soviet military leader Voroshilov, and the other is the French General Foch. The reason why General Wei became famous is of course due to their two generals.

Current Affairs Reflections

### Yu Xiangyan Surrenders

— Chong Zheng

Yu Xiangyan, who had been missing for two months, suddenly surrendered, breaking the deadlock in the Two-Roads Bureau corruption case. It was something no one would have expected. I believe, and hope, that the whole case will be revealed because of this.

Two days ago, this magazine happened to mention this issue, and offered two suggestions: 1. Yu Xiangyan should step forward, 2. I hope to hear the outcome. Unexpectedly, the next day's newspaper published the news that "Yu Xiangyan surrendered."

Now, we can hear the truth. Who is right and who is wrong will soon be revealed to society. Civil servants who are devoted to their duties and abide by the law should be commended, and those who are corrupt and fraudulent must be severely punished! This is a matter of course?

According to the various points stated by Yu Xiangyan after his surrender, many people are involved, and the situation seems unusually complicated. However, before obtaining formal evidence, we dare not make any rash comments. Everything awaits legal exploration and judgment! In addition to deeply believing that the authorities will surely enforce the law like a mountain and punish corruption, we also hope for two things: 1. Yu Xiangyan is best not the protagonist of the case, but serves as the reporter and witness of the corruption in the case, so as to comply with the various points stated in her two letters to this newspaper; 2. The relationship between Director Chen and the police department with the case, as stated, is best not true!

Anecdotes from the Newspaper World

### Coincidence

— Gang Guo

Two Major Encyclopedias, East and West

In the era when this newspaper was run by the British Major brothers (Frederic and Ernest Major), from 1885 to 1888, the "Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Illustrations and Books" was reprinted in movable type. This huge book of 1,628 volumes is one of the most important encyclopedias in our country. Westerners call it the "Kangxi Encyclopedia" (Kang Hsi Imperial Encyclopedia), and the edition printed by this newspaper is called the "Major Bros. Edition".

Recently, I read an article in the Christian Science Monitor commenting on the London Times, which mentioned that the Times reprinted the ninth edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica in 1898, with each set attached with a beautifully crafted oak book box, which sold very well. The Times was experiencing financial difficulties at that time, and relied on this to tide over the difficulties. The two major newspapers in the East and West, almost at the same time, were famous for reprinting large-scale encyclopedias. It can be said that it is a coincidence.

Right Elder's Virtuous Governance

We, the reporters who send news telegrams, as well as all the newspapers and news agencies, must thank Mr. Yu Youren for the convenience and benefits he has given us.

According to the current regulations of the Ministry of Communications' telegraph regulations, news telegrams are charged at a quarter of the price of ordinary telegrams, and urgent news telegrams are charged at a quarter of the price of ordinary telegrams plus four times the fee (that is, equal to half the telegraph fee of urgent commercial telegrams). The sender has a news telegram license, and the fee can be paid by the recipient. This kind of benefit and convenience was not enjoyed by reporters and newspapers when domestic telegrams were first connected at the end of the Qing Dynasty. Later, news telegrams were only reduced by half.

It was not until 1912, when Mr. Yu Youren was the Minister of Communications, that news telegrams were reduced by three-quarters compared to commercial telegrams. Before entering politics, Mr. Yu was a senior in the newspaper industry, having founded the Shenzhou, Minhu, Minxu, and Minli newspapers. He deeply knew the hardships of the newspaper industry, so he was particularly able to take care of the welfare of the newspaper industry when he was the Minister of Communications. We are still benefiting from him to this day. I wonder how many people know about the virtuous governance he left behind during his short tenure in communications administration?

### Where Did Sherlock Holmes Come From (1)

— Written by Shi Daoai, Translated by Yu Qiang

Editor's Note: Many people know Sherlock Holmes and love to read this type of book. But do you know where Sherlock Holmes came from? Here is the story of Sherlock Holmes's birth. Are you willing to listen?

London in 1886, on the surface, looked very similar to London in previous years. Queen Victoria continued to sit safely on her throne. Conservative Party leader Salisbury Binley once again drove his political enemy Gladestone from the Prime Minister's seat. Ireland was disturbed by riots and rebellions; and Beechum's pills were universally recognized as an effective treatment for nervous disorders. In the literary world, according to the author's age, the chief may be Stevenson, Henry James, and Henty; but an Irishman named Wilde made himself a model of the fantasy era as a priest of aesthetics. In the theater world, Cellier's "Dorothy" was celebrating its 968th performance at the Happy Theatre, and "Lighthouse" was shining brightly at the Adelphi Theatre. In Piccadilly, horse races were fast and dangerous. There was no impending war, and the vast world was at peace. This was a clean and happy era, a rich and fulfilling era. There were also no astronomical phenomena to indicate an epoch-making event. As the history of the world has indicated more than once, a blue moon is a sign of the birth of an extraordinary person. Indeed, no planet fell to tell a poor rural doctor living in Southsea, near Linzmouth Port, that he had led a new immortal character into the world of literature.

Sherlock Holmes had come into the world at this time. Accompanied by Dr. Watson, who was temporarily serving in the 5th Northumberland Fusiliers, Holmes rented a room at 221B Baker Street in London and engaged in his amazing private detective business. He will exist there forever when this world is still being cared about.

A Person Who Knows Detectives Well

Dr. Arthur Conan Doyle of Southsea, near Lyndhurst, was not having a good time. This young man had just married, and he supplemented his early medical career with the small fees he earned from writing articles for magazines. He was very likely to write short stories forever without making progress. He was convinced that it was necessary, if a person wanted to become a writer, to have their name on the cover of a book. His first novel—The Firm of Girdlestone—was a miserable failure, and the manuscript was still in the house. But he often thought about the possibility of creating a fresh style in detective literature. The simplicity of the plot of the works of Gabo Lio made him like and cherish the capable amateur detective Dupin, who was his childhood hero. What about these? he asked himself. If Doyle could bring these into the garden of detective literature, it would undoubtedly become his own.

Outside his door, at night, a red light was lit, which was the sign of his profession. During the day, the copper plate engraved with his name, which was cleaned every morning, shone brightly in the Southsea sunlight. But the patients attracted by these two signs were very few. In the waiting room, there were three chairs, a rug, and a small piece of carpet. As he sat there smoking and thinking, the figure of a professor from his university appeared before him—a professor named Joseph Bell, thin, strong, swarthy, with a high nose, sharp face, shrugged shoulders, and gray and sharp eyes, a professor who walked in a very special way, Joseph Bell, Doctor of Medicine from the University of Edinburgh, surgeon at the Royal Infirmary and the Royal Children's Hospital, his tone was high and discordant, his surgical skills were very profound, and his mysterious diagnostic skills were a legend of the medical school. This matter, as seen by the young doctor waiting for the patients who did not come, if Bell decided to become a detective, he would make "this fantastic and lifeless career become something close to a complete science."

Bell, for reasons that Doyle, the student, would never fully understand, took him out of a group of students in the ward to be his outpatient assistant. This was not a heavy task, he only needed to arrange the order of the patients waiting for consultation, record simple conditions, and then lead them into a large room, where Bell sat quietly. But the young Doyle immediately understood one thing: Bell only needed to glance at the patient, and he knew more than he knew from head to toe.

"He sat in his consulting room," Doyle, the novelist of the time, wrote, "like an Indian. When the patient stepped into the room, before he opened his mouth: he was already diagnosing. He would tell the patient what their symptoms were, and even say what their past lives were like, but he would rarely be wrong."

The author tells us that many results are often dramatic. Once, he observed a civilian patient say: "Oh, you served in the army, right?"

"Yes, sir."

"You haven't been discharged for long?"

"That's right, sir."

"Belonging to the Scottish Highlands Corps?"

"Yes, sir."

"A non-junior officer?"

"Yes, sir."

"Stationed in Barbados? [Note: British West Indian territory.]"

"Yes, sir."

"Pay attention, everyone," the doctor explained to the students and assistants surrounding him, "this gentleman is a respectable figure, but he didn't take off his hat. People in the army don't take off their hats; if he had been discharged for a long time, he should have learned civilian etiquette. His demeanor is very powerful, and he is obviously a Scotsman. Regarding Barbados, because his symptoms are elephantiasis, this disease is prevalent in the West Indies, and it is not seen in Britain."

### Serial Comic - San Mao Joins the Army (88)
