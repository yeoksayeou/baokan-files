### Second Reading of the Draft Constitution Completed, Officials May Still be Elected as National Assembly Representatives, Disorderly Scenes at the 19th Session

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The 19th session of the National Assembly was held at 3:30 PM on the 24th. At the start of the meeting, 1,185 representatives were present, later increasing to 1,412. Chairman Wang Yunwu reported, and after the clerk read the minutes of the 18th meeting, the second reading work continued, starting from Chapter 14, "Implementation and Amendment of the Constitution," and Articles "146," "147," and "148" were passed without objection. For Article "149," "The interpretation of the Constitution shall be made by the Judicial Yuan," Ni Bi and 36 others proposed an amendment to change it to "The interpretation of the Constitution shall be made by a Constitution Interpretation Committee jointly formed by the Legislative, Judicial, and Control Yuan, with the President of the Judicial Yuan as the chairman." After Ni explained the reasons, Wang Zilan expressed opposition, saying that the power of constitutional interpretation in the United States belongs to the judicial organs, and no errors have ever occurred. He advocated maintaining the original proposal. After a vote, the amendment received 271 votes, but with 909 votes in the majority, the original proposal was maintained. For Article "150" regarding the amendment procedure of the constitution, there were two amendments: (1) Gu Yuxiu and 164 others proposed that the original text of the first paragraph of the article be changed to "It may be amended by the proposal of one-fifth of the total number of National Assembly representatives, the attendance of two-thirds (originally three-quarters), and the resolution of three-quarters (originally two-thirds) of the attending representatives," so as to conform to the legal number of constitution-making in Article 12 of the National Assembly Organization Law, so as to adapt to environmental needs and prevent the restrictions on amending the constitution from being too strict. After a vote, Gu et al.'s amendment was passed with 1,062 votes. (2) Su Zhi and 30 others requested that the word "正" (zheng, rectify) in the second paragraph of the article, "Legislative Yuan 'formulates draft constitutional amendments'," be changed to "改" (gai, amend). After a vote, it received 489 votes, but with 1,025 votes, the original text was maintained. For Article "151," "If it is necessary to separately stipulate the implementation procedures for the matters stipulated in this constitution, it shall be determined by law," there were two related amendments: (1) Xuan Xiao and 44 others requested that the review results of the Second Committee be maintained, and Article 152 be added, "The National Assembly that formulates the constitution shall be responsible for supervising and promoting the implementation of the constitution, and the term of office of its representatives shall terminate on the day when the group people's congress established in accordance with this constitution convenes." After the amended opinion was read out, Chairman Wang said that this opinion had been incorporated into the transitional provisions by the resolution of the Comprehensive Review Committee, and it seemed unnecessary to add it. He also asked Chen Cheng, the convener of the committee, to explain. The audience demanded an immediate vote. Wang shouted that this article was important and should be explained. After Chen's explanation, at the request of Duan Jianmin and others, it was put to a vote. As a result, 646 votes were in the minority, and the sound of "anti-voting" immediately rose, and order was declared disrupted. Chairman Wang shouted loudly: If the audience proposes anti-voting, it must be seconded by more than 50 people. Arms were lined up densely for a while, and anti-voting was immediately carried out. First, the Deputy Secretary-General explained the nature of anti-voting, but Lei's official language was not effective. Some representatives roared again: "I can't hear clearly, what are you saying?" "Change the Secretary-General!" and so on. The meeting place was in turmoil. As a result of the anti-voting, the amendment was still rejected. (2) Gu Yuxiu and 81 others requested that a clause be added to Article 151, "The preparatory procedures for the implementation of this constitution shall be determined by the National Assembly that formulates the constitution," as a transitional clause, "The preparatory procedures for the implementation of the constitution" have a legal basis. After Gu briefly explained it, it was put to a vote and passed smoothly with an absolute majority of 1,217 votes. The original text of the case was also passed without objection. At this point, the draft articles have all been read, and the discussion of several reconsideration cases began. The first to be proposed was the two reconsideration cases against the third clause added in the second reading of Article 28, "Incumbent officials may not be elected as representatives of the National Assembly"; (1) Hu Shi and 809 others requested that the clause be amended to "Incumbent officials may not be elected as representatives of the National Assembly in the electoral district where they are located" (2) Yan Guofu et al. requested that the clause be deleted and need not be explicitly listed in the constitution. After the two amendments were read out, there was a great deal of booing. The co-signer Chen Yunyu said that the provision deprived officials of their right to be elected, which violated the principle of universal suffrage and had the suspicion of sacrificing talent. Therefore, he advocated reconsideration and amendment. After Chen returned to his seat amidst the booing, Hu Shuhua again made a theory in favor of the amendment amidst the sound of "nonsense and random talk," but in the end, due to the chaotic order, everyone did not know what he was saying.

Then Ren Zhuoxuan spoke, opposing the amendment, believing that the provision was extremely reasonable, and stated five reasons: (1) The provision stipulates the negative qualifications of National Assembly representatives. If officials want to be elected as representatives, they can resign from their official positions first. (2) After the civil service system is established, administrative officials should compete for political officials. Official affairs are complex and important, and they should also fully implement policies instead of running for representatives. (3) One of the main tasks of the National Assembly is to elect the President and Vice President. If officials serve as representatives to engage in elections, they will inevitably take their own officialdom as their goal when making choices. Another task is to impeach the President and Vice President. How can subordinates impeach superiors? (4) Officials who also serve as National Assembly representatives combine party politics and two powers, violating the Founding Father's principle of dividing power and ability. Democracy means that everyone does things together. Those who are officials both receive salaries and also seize the position of representative, which is a minority of people specializing in fishing for profit and cannot be called democracy. He also emphasized: "Officials protect each other." Officials running for election in other places does not affect their exercise of power, but will only waste manpower and money. As a result, those who can truly represent the people cannot be elected, and the National Assembly will become a "Officials' Congress."

Yang Dopu continued to speak, saying: "Officials are officials, and people are people, and they should be separated." He cited the example of councilors in the Political Participation Council not being allowed to concurrently hold official positions and the established rules of Western countries, calling on the audience to consider carefully and maintain the original resolution. Several representatives further opposed the establishment of the amendment on the grounds that there was no provision in the rules of procedure for reconsideration of matters resolved in the second reading. Chairman Wang replied that what is not available in the rules of procedure can be submitted according to the provisions of the "Elementary Rights of the People." Reconsideration has been endorsed by more than half of the representatives, and it can be proposed. If it can be passed by two-thirds, it can also be established. After Yan Guofu explained his proposal to delete the article, it was put to a vote, and the deletion case was rejected with a minority of 629 votes. The amendment by Hu Shi et al. was passed with 921 votes. (The number of people present was 1,303.) Officials can still be elected as National Assembly representatives.

After a fifteen-minute break at 5:00 PM, the discussion of the reconsideration cases continued. The proposal by Ma Xuchang, Chen Shaoping, and others to restore the provisions of "amnesty" in Articles "41," "59," and "63" was passed with 745 votes. The proposal by Bao Mingshu and others to add the word "news" in Article "160" to protect the lives of journalists was still rejected with a minority of 543 votes. The temporary proposal by Zhang Zhijiang and others to add the word "sports" in Article "153" (originally Article "143")

At 5:35 PM, the discussion of the "Draft Preparatory Procedures for the Implementation of the Constitution" began. The clerk read out the full text, and after Sun Ke explained it, some representatives raised questions to correct two typographical errors in Articles 2 and 8, and believed that the phrase "the first National Assembly established in accordance with (this) Constitution" in each article was inappropriate, and advocated that it be deleted uniformly. Zhao Zimao advocated deleting Article 8, believing that when two-thirds of the total number of National Assembly representatives, legislators, and censors are elected, they can convene meetings or convocations, which deprives the powers of the remaining one-third. Chen Huanzhang and others again advocated that the various legislations stipulated in Article 2 of this procedure should be specified as being authorized by the National Assembly to the National Government, and the functions and powers of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee in Article 9 should also be specified as being determined by the National Government by law. At 6:00 PM, after Chairman Wang obtained the consent of the audience, he extended the meeting by ten minutes and then began voting. Except for the word "first" on the National Assembly in each article, it was resolved to delete it uniformly with 902 votes, and the entire document was passed without objection according to the original draft. At 6:05 PM, Chairman Wang announced the end of the second reading session, and Deputy Secretary-General Lei reported that the meeting would continue on the 25th before adjourning.

### Soviet Restrictions on US Warships Leaving Dalian Cause Significant Repercussions in the US, Deemed to Violate the Spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty

Democratic Senator Stuart Hua Calls for Thorough Investigation

[Central News Agency, New York, 23rd] The Soviet Union's expulsion of a US warship from Dalian on December 20 has become the most important international news in New York today. All afternoon newspapers carried it on the front page. The message from Dalian by the joint special correspondent of each newspaper, the liberal New York Post, was headlined; "The Soviet Union Has Driven the US Warship Out of China". The Hearst-owned newspaper was headlined: "The Soviet Union's Ultimatum to the US Warship Limits the US Warship to Leave Dalian Within Twenty Minutes". The conservative New York Sun headline: "The Soviet Army in Dalian Expelled the US Warship". The Howard-owned World Telegraph headline: "The Soviet Army Ordered the US Warship to Withdraw from Dalian". It also noted that the Dun was the Howard-owned newspaper's correspondent in China. The article stated: "The illegal actions of the Soviet army in Dalian are a threat to peace in Asia. China was originally recognized as having sovereignty in Dalian, but since the Soviet army entered, it immediately controlled the city and has since refused to return it to China. The Soviet army has established a regime here and controls the local police. We are accustomed to hearing that the Soviet Union is covering up the world with a curtain. The communist people and the garter belt rumors published by American tourists here claim that the United States has a large number of army and navy stationed in China, and loudly called out, pointing to sell it to threaten the general peace of the world, especially the Soviet-US relations; but these Moscow "fifth column" have never mentioned the Soviet Union's high pressure and illegal actions in Dalian. We have never violated the sovereignty of the country in any city in China, and any city where our army is stationed has never refused Soviet citizens the right to enter. Our country has only a small number of troops in Wuhu and fully recognizes China's sovereignty, while the Soviet Union's control of Dalian is completely contrary to this situation, which is extremely contrary to the spirit of the Soviet-Soviet Friendship Treaty. So who is the real threat to peace in the East? Is it the United States? Or the Soviet Union?"

[United Press, Washington, 24th] Democratic Senator Stuart Hua today called for a thorough investigation of the Soviet authorities' verbal notice ordering a non-armed US naval vessel to leave Dalian within twenty minutes, saying that this matter should be thoroughly investigated. I don't know what the State Department and the Navy will say about it, and I am very interested in it. The State Department is quietly waiting for the official report from Peng Ninghoff, the US Consul General in Dalian, and is maintaining silence. According to a spokesman, if there is no report in a few days, he will be asked to submit it quickly.

### Ambassador Will Meet Ye Jianying, Attends Yenching University Alumni Reception Today

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] The reason for Ambassador Stuart Leiden's visit to the North remains a mystery. General observations suggest that it may be to observe the situation in the North for mediation purposes. News from Yenching University: The Ambassador will visit the three members of the Military Mediation Department this morning, but there was no trace of the Ambassador at Xiehe Hospital today. Fu Jingbo said: The Ambassador did not go out all day today, but news from Yenching University said that the Ambassador arrived long after the candlelight worship scheduled for 4:00 PM this afternoon. Ye Jianying contacted yesterday to arrange a meeting time, which may be in the next few days. Sun Lianzhong, who suddenly returned to Ping from Baoding yesterday, attended General Gillen's banquet last night, and Li Zongren was also invited. It is rumored that the Ambassador may also have been present, but this has not been confirmed. This morning, Sun Lianzhong visited Fu Jingbo. Hints of this show that the Ambassador's visit to the North is not simple. The Ambassador will attend the Yenching University alumni reception tomorrow. The Ambassador's Christmas gift to his Yenching University students was 400 catties of rice and 400 catties of pork. It is rumored here that the Ambassador will cancel his trip to Tianjin on the sixth day and return directly to Nanjing, but Fu Jingbo did not confirm this news tonight, and said that the Ambassador's trip was because there were many matters to be heard from Northern American businessmen and people after the promulgation of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty.

### Ambassador's Christmas Remarks

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Before going to Beiping for Christmas, US Ambassador to China Dr. Stuart Leiden published his Christmas remarks in the Central Daily News yesterday. The full text is as follows:

The exact day of Jesus Christ's birth is probably impossible to determine forever. The earliest churches, relying only on that pious intuition, chose the Roman winter solstice festival without hesitation to celebrate this most meaningful historical event. Because before the winter solstice, the white day gradually shortens and the black night gradually lengthens. Once it reaches the winter solstice, the situation reverses and the time of illumination increases with each passing day, which is the prelude to spring coming to the human world and the earth turning green. Assuming that Jesus was born on this day, it may be explained as bringing spiritual encouragement and hope to the declining Roman Empire at that time. When the good news of Jesus' birth spread among the savage tribes of Northern Europe, they naturally followed suit and passed down the custom of collectively surrounding evergreen trees every Christmas. The reason why they did this was that they saw the day constantly shortening and feared that the sun would completely disappear into the long night. Therefore, they were willing to accompany the sun and perish in the severe cold. So they held on tightly to the only symbol of hope they knew - the evergreen tree, and used the newly discovered faith and joyful expression to set it off. In this way, for more than a thousand years, the customs of Christmas have been added to and beautified by all the ethnic groups in the world. These vivid traditional customs of ancient folk and all the beautiful embellishments that we use to celebrate Christmas today have great significance for the spiritual sincerity hidden beneath these things.

"Peace on Earth, goodwill to men" is a well-known saying in the world of Jesus today, but when Judah was ruled by Rome and suffered from the autocratic oppression of imperialism, a conquered country was filled with the spirit of resistance. This saying seemed to have no hope of being fulfilled for them. Since then, in human history, human prospects have been looked forward to several times, but they always seem dim and without light. Today, we are once again celebrating the Christmas season of 1948, and the world situation seems to remain unchanged. However, if we look at this world with historical eyes, we can easily know that the world has made great progress since then. With the hope aroused by this festival, we can calmly and steadily look forward to a broader and more lasting peace, and hope to obtain an increasing "joy" in the world through cultural exchange and other methods of seeking international understanding. This "joy" should be entrusted to the more sublime ideals and more sacred purposes of countless people in all countries of the world, who unite and resolutely work to build a more perfect world. When we dedicate ourselves to this sacred work in the spirit of Christmas, we will undoubtedly be able to exchange it for the joy of the New Year.

### Zhang Qi-yun's Speech: "National Reconstruction Plan"

Recognizing Nanjing as a Hub for Land, Sea, and Air Transportation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Jinling University held a memorial week on the 23rd, inviting National Assembly Representative and scholar Professor Zhang Qi-yun to give a speech entitled "National Reconstruction Plan." From a geographical perspective, he explained the book "The Fundamentals of National Reconstruction" by Sun Yat-sen, stating that Dr. Sun's greatest contribution was to determine the main lines and key points of national reconstruction, with clear and insightful analysis. Finally, he pointed out Nanjing's position in the National Reconstruction Plan, stating that the eastern major port under the Central Railway, with the Tacheng Line being the longest railway line in the country, divides the country into two parts. Starting from Hangzhou Bay in the east and ending at the northern route of the Tianshan Mountains in the west, it connects the major cities of Nanjing, Xi'an, and Lanzhou, making it the first major line of national reconstruction, also known as the Central Avenue. He also stated that a river basin is a natural unit for economic construction, and the country can be divided into eight major river basins. The Yangtze River basin has a population of 200 million, nearly half of the country's population, and is known as the Golden Waterway. Nanjing is located at the intersection of the Central Avenue and the Golden Waterway, with the sea tide reaching directly under the city. Land, sea, and air transportation can all use this as a hub, making it the largest military center in the country, and it has a strategic guiding role for the great cause of national reconstruction.

### On Christmas Eve, Cardinal Tian Addresses All Catholics, Encouraging Them to Be Role Models for Society and Revive Traditional Virtues

[Our Newspaper] Cardinal Tian Gengxin, the Archbishop of Beiping, recently issued a letter to all Catholics on Christmas Eve. The full text is as follows:

Dear Catholics,

When I returned from Rome in June this year, I broadcast to you in Nanjing in the name of the first Chinese cardinal. Now it is again the eve of the Nativity of Our Lord. The arrival of this festival brings joy and peace to mankind. Today, on Christmas Eve, we must first express our sincere gratitude to Almighty God for all the graces of the past year.

The past year has been very important in the history of the Church in our country, and even in the history of the entire nation. During that year, we saw the appointment of the first Chinese cardinal, the establishment of the Catholic Church system in China, the designation of twenty provincial chief archdioceses, and the appointment of the first provincial chief archbishops, the abolition of the Apostolic Delegation to China, the appointment of the first papal nuncio to China, and the establishment of the papal nunciature. All these are very significant measures, which are epoch-making not only in the history of the Church and the nation in China, but also in the history of mankind and the world. We thank our Holy Father for his concern for the Church in China. Due to these measures, the Catholic Church in China has entered the realm of adulthood. Dear Catholics, precisely because of these measures, the responsibility of each of us Catholics has also been increased.

The Catholic Church is the holy and universal Church. The reason why the Catholic Church in China has the situation it has today is due to the continuous efforts of the various religious orders and the Chinese and foreign missionaries who are not members of religious orders. Their blood and sweat have irrigated this vineyard of God. Today, when the Church system has already been established in China, we should not only remember their past merits, but also cooperate hand in hand to promote the affairs of the Church in our country. Religion has no national boundaries, and the cause of saving souls has no nationality. In the realm of religion, we cannot allow narrow nationalism; we should actively promote the spirit of holiness and universality of the Holy Church. Dear Catholics, in the Pope's announcement, we see the Holy Father telling us that the threat to the Catholic Church is not external, but internal. Now that we see the establishment of the Catholic Church system in China, we must be careful to prevent the invasion of threats; we must defend our faith. We must unite. Chinese and foreign priests should be united as one, and the priests and the Catholics should also communicate with each other and participate in the spread of the faith under the guidance of the clergy. In the encyclical "Non abbiamo bisogno" (We do not need), Pope Pius XI mentioned the participation of Catholics in the Catholic missionary work. Therefore, it is the responsibility of every Catholic to cooperate with the clergy and promote our Holy Church under the guidance of the local bishops, so that those who have not yet seen the truth can also see the light. This is especially important in our China. Today, we Catholics account for only a very small number of the total population of the country. How to spread our Holy Church to more people is not only the responsibility of the clergy, but also the responsibility of every Catholic. Every Catholic should be a brave soldier of Jesus, each in his own position, to defend and spread our Holy Church.

However, when we think of the responsibilities that every Catholic should fulfill, we cannot but point out some of the current trends. The Church of Our Lord Jesus is built on the throne of the Apostle Peter; and Peter is the rock. The past efforts of the Catholic Church in China, following the glorious traditions of the Holy Church, are also built on a solid foundation; we cannot shake this foundation. All our efforts are for the "City of God" (Civitas Dei); therefore, every Catholic should not only have devout faith, but also express their faith in their actions, in their daily lives, so that our faith and our life and behavior become one and become a living faith. In today's society of moral decay and fallen ethics, we Catholics should be role models for society in order to change the social atmosphere. Our traditional spirit of honesty and sincerity must not be corroded by foreign frivolity. Every Catholic should remember the candle he held when he was baptized; we cannot allow fierce winds to blow it out.

For this reason, dear Catholics, we have a greater mission in today's society. Our leader, Chairman Chiang, saw the importance of rebuilding the moral order long before the War of Resistance, and urgently sought to revive the virtues of our country in order to establish a new life for the general public. In the efforts to build the nation's spirit, we should bear the responsibilities we should bear. We must use our religious life to set an example in this time of social disorder. National rejuvenation may then be possible.

Finally, I would like to ask all Catholics in our country to pray for our Holy Father and our national leader. May God bless the Holy Church in China, so that we can have today. May Almighty God, in our future difficult path, be able to illuminate us, as in the past; so that the arrival of the Christmas holiday can enable more people to obtain true peace and happiness.

### Editorial: Defending the Nation and Drafting the Constitution

—In Commemoration of the Yunnan Uprising

Today is the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. After the National Assembly passed the draft constitution in the third reading, it also concluded successfully in Beijing this morning. A democratic constitution that the people of the whole country have been looking forward to day and night for many years has finally been drafted. Recalling today thirty-one years ago, General Cai Songpo launched the Yunnan Uprising, first declared independence, and finally overthrew Yuan Shikai's imperial system, and re-established a solid foundation for the Republic of China. This glorious history, although thirty-one years have passed, is still vividly remembered by the people of the country, as if it were before their eyes. Therefore, the National Assembly's successful conclusion of its constitutional work today has very significant meaning.

For thousands of years, our country has been an autocratic empire. In recent centuries, the people have gradually awakened and urgently demanded the democratization of politics. The success of the Xinhai Revolution achieved the initial goal, but Yuan Shikai, after becoming the president, was still not satisfied and insisted on becoming an autocratic emperor. This led to General Cai Songpo launching the Yunnan Uprising to defend the nation, and finally overthrowing the imperial system and restoring the republic. The politics of the Republic of China could have been expected to embark on a new and smooth path, but the warlord separatism and the manipulation of politicians caused years of domestic wars. After the success of the National Revolution and the Northern Expedition, the situation of unifying China was roughly settled, and the National Government followed Dr. Sun's teachings and moved from the military government period to the tutelage period, and then wanted to move from the tutelage period to the constitutional period. Just as the tutelage was about to end, the July 7th Incident suddenly occurred. After eight years of arduous resistance, the enemy was finally defeated, and the national foundation of the Republic of China was re-established.

From the day the enemy surrendered, the people of the whole country issued a call for "political democratization." At the same time, the ruling Kuomintang had long wanted to return power to the people, so that China's politics could embark on the right track of democracy and the rule of law as soon as possible. However, due to the long-standing problem between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the National Assembly was repeatedly postponed, and its constitutional work could not be carried out. It was not until November 15 that the National Assembly was able to open in Nanjing. It closed today, completing the constitutional work, which lasted one month and ten days. This is the most important page in modern Chinese history.

During these forty-five days, the National Assembly engaged in constitutional work. Although there were also quarrels and instances of disrespect for order in the venue, this is an inevitable phenomenon in the parliament of any country, and it is enough to show the spirit of democracy and freedom. When the various groups were reviewing the draft constitution separately, the opinions of the representatives were inevitably complex, and various amendments were proposed. However, when it came to the comprehensive group, difficult opinions could be eliminated invisibly, so that the draft constitution passed by the entire assembly did not make fundamental revisions to the original draft proposed by the government. The original draft proposed by the government was based on the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and then decided by the party meetings. Now it has been passed by the National Assembly, which shows that this new constitution is the crystallization of the will of the people of the whole country, and its implementation in the future will surely be twice the result with half the effort.

We have always believed that democracy cannot be transplanted and systems cannot be copied; and we also believe that there is no absolute superiority or inferiority in constitutional systems, and there will be advantages and disadvantages. It is only required that it be practical and feasible. Therefore, we believe that the constitution passed by the National Assembly is satisfactory; the problem in the future is not the constitution itself, but how to implement the constitution. Looking back at the international environment, because the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference and the United Nations General Assembly concluded successfully one after another, 1946 has a peaceful conclusion, and a beautiful prospect is unfolding for the world in 1947; therefore, we have unlimited new hopes for the domestic political situation: the new constitution of the Republic of China is scheduled to be promulgated on New Year's Day next year, and the government will also be reorganized after the National Assembly closes, expanding the government's foundation and recruiting all parties and factions as well as social notables to participate in it; at the same time, there is hope of reopening peace talks, and it is not impossible for the political situation to become clear from then on. Therefore, on this anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising, inspired by the martyrs' defense of the nation, and looking forward to the future of the Republic of China, we have strengthened our unwavering confidence.

### Asian Student Conference

The tank ended World War I, the atomic bomb ended World War II, and after that there will only be one world, otherwise the world will be destroyed. The countries of the atomic age are as closely intertwined as the trees in a forest. If one tree catches fire, the fire will spread to all the trees. Unless there is a fire protection plan for the entire forest, it is not safe. Mankind should now realize that civilization, which is the result of human endeavor, should not be turned into cannon fodder. The atomic bomb has destroyed the earth, and it must also destroy mankind's prejudices and selfishness. Countries can no longer regard the private desires of their own countries as the highest morality, but must seek the prosperity of a system.

The war is won, and peace has only turned the first page. We see that in various international conferences, yesterday's allies have become today's enemies, and the euphoria of victory should not drive away the pain of blood. We should not regard the victory of the war as the end of our efforts, but should regard it as the beginning of our efforts. Nationalities must be equal, politics must be democratic, and the world must be peaceful. This is an irresistible world trend. Asia has many weak nations, and their desire for equality, democracy, and peace is even greater than elsewhere. Recently, Indian students launched the "Asian Student Preparatory Conference." Perhaps their declaration is for this reason. The most concise words in their English declaration are: "All our science, art, and culture are the light of the world. We lead the world to create a society, a nation, a human being, living in our own will."

The All-India Students' Association issued a notice in Mumbai on December 15, requesting students from Asian countries to send representatives to the first Asian Student Preparatory Conference on December 30, to be held in Lahore, the capital of Punjab, to organize an Asian Students' Association. The countries invited are China, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, Java, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Our country has selected representatives from six universities: Peking University, Central University, Sun Yat-sen University, Sichuan University, Fudan University, and Ginling Women's University, and sent a team leader to fly to Kunming and then to India immediately.

This event, like the Pan-Asian Conference convened by India, came suddenly. It seems to have nothing to do with the World Federation of Democratic Youth, but there are clues to be found. The association was initiated by the United Kingdom and met in Paris in the summer of 1946. At the meeting, the Indian student representatives had already revealed the idea of an Asian international student conference. Whether this student conference is for India, for weak nations, or for the whole world, we cannot stand idly by. For India is for weak nations, and also for the whole world. For weak nations is for India, and also for the whole world. Are these three questions actually one question? At least these three questions have close interrelationships. In today's world trend, nationalities must be independent, politics must be democratic, and international relations must be peaceful. India has suffered for two hundred years and fought hard for two hundred years. Now the time is ripe. When the British Labour Party came to power, Prime Minister Attlee declared: "The Labour government firmly believes in the principle of national self-determination, and should find ways to help the 400 million people of India solve the difficulties of creating their own autonomous government." However, the goal of India's revolutionary movement is to build a completely independent country, rather than merely being satisfied with autonomy, because India's nationality, culture, and Britain, Australia, etc. are completely different and cannot be forcibly united. This point needs to be carefully considered and worked on.

At the end of this war, there was first the Atlantic Charter and the Declaration of the United Nations, which clearly stated the war aims. Then there was President Roosevelt's declaration of the Four Freedoms, and even the Moscow Four-Nation Universal Security Declaration. Finally, they were condensed into the United Nations Charter of the San Francisco Conference, all advocating that all nationalities have the freedom to choose their government, and that the revolutionary movements of weak nations can no longer be suppressed with bayonets and prisons, and that the world can no longer be half free and half enslaved. Today's world has shrunk, and security is absolutely indivisible. No strong country can independently resist foreign aggression. This war has already proven that no country can achieve victory alone. The future will be even worse. Even if most countries unite, they still cannot guarantee security. The peace of the whole world must be planned first in order to guarantee the security of the whole world. This is the lesson of the atomic age, and it is also the biggest reason for the development of world peace after the war.

Young students have the least personal gains and grudges, and are full of a sense of justice and a pure heart. They should cooperate equally with the Wang Zhe philosophy of China and all the representatives, in order to seek the security and peace of India, small nationalities, and the world. Perhaps this conference will be more successful than the Paris Peace Conference. China is magnanimous and is of course the leading country in Asia, but this leadership does not need to be fought for. Whoever can lead will be supported by others.

### The Eighteenth National Congress Passes Basic Policy Chapters

The Guarantee for Journalists Still Failed to Be Included in the Draft Constitution

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The Eighteenth National Congress convened this morning at 9:50 AM, with 131 members present. Chairman Kong Xiangxi announced the opening of the meeting. Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen reported the decision of the Presidium's 28th meeting to extend the session to the 25th. Subsequently, the second reading of the constitution draft continued, starting with Article 140 of Chapter 12 on Basic National Policies regarding the national economy. Amendment 140, originally Article 142, was passed without objection. Regarding Article 141, which concerned private property rights and private enterprises, Ding Zhengcheng proposed an amendment stating that private wealth should be protected, private enterprises should be assisted in their development, and should not be restricted. After Ding's speech, Lei Zhen explained that it was a personal proposal by Ding without endorsement. Ding requested a discussion, but it was voted down as a minority view, and the original proposal was maintained by majority vote. Article 142 was passed with objections. Liu Zhendong and others suggested adding an article after Article 142, stating: "The central government, in order to promote balanced economic development between provinces, should provide appropriate subsidies to impoverished provinces. Provinces, in order to promote balanced economic development between counties, should provide appropriate subsidies to impoverished counties." Liu explained the reasons for the proposal as follows: (1) China has a vast territory, and the economic conditions of the provinces, or the counties within each province, vary greatly. If impoverished provinces and counties are not given appropriate subsidies, the development of the national economy will be impossible. (2) If the economies of the provinces and counties cannot be balanced, the development of the national economy will be greatly hindered. The original draft was too brief. The Seventh Review Committee had added several articles, but the Synthesis Committee omitted them, so they should be added. It was put to a vote and passed by a majority. Article 143 was passed without objection. Cui Wei-wu and others proposed an amendment, believing that Articles 144 and 145 should be merged because the former only stipulated that the state should manage finance according to law, and there should be more concrete provisions for financial institutions, and the term "grassroots financial institutions" in the latter was not clear enough. Therefore, merging and modifying the two articles would make the meaning more complete. It was put to a vote and rejected as a minority view, and the original proposal was passed by a majority. Regarding Article 145, Li Wenzhai and others proposed an amendment, believing that the term "grassroots" was ambiguous and should be changed to "farmers," and the following phrase should be changed to "to enrich the rural economy and improve the lives of farmers," which was biased towards farmers. General opinion was that it should remain "grassroots" to be more inclusive. A vote was taken, and the original proposal was passed by a majority. There was a proposal to amend Article 146 into a special chapter on overseas Chinese affairs, but after a vote, the original proposal was ultimately passed by a majority. The discussion then continued to Chapter 13 regarding social security, from Article 147 to Article 152, all of which were passed without objection. In Section 4, regarding education and culture, Wu Wentian proposed an amendment to Article 153, seeking to modify the wording regarding science, but it was voted down as a minority view, and the original proposal was passed by a majority. Regarding Article 154, Wang Bosheng proposed an amendment and explained that the future of China's revival should focus on the arts and culture. As an artist, Wang strongly argued for its importance and requested that the original draft be maintained, but ultimately the explanation was too long and did not gain majority agreement, resulting in a minority rejection and a majority passing the original proposal. Articles 155 to 158 were all passed without objection. Li Xianyang once proposed an amendment to add an article after Article 157: "Schools at all levels should gradually implement a free education system so that children from poor families can have the opportunity to receive advanced education, in order to cultivate a large number of talents," particularly emphasizing the awarding and assistance of outstanding children from poor families, but the public believed that it was not necessary to stipulate this in the constitution, and it was voted down as a minority. Regarding Article 159, Zhao Naichuan proposed adding the four words "recurrent expenditure" under the education budget, but a vote was taken, and the original proposal was passed by a majority. Article 160: "The state should guarantee the livelihood of education, science, and art workers and increase their remuneration from time to time in accordance with the progress of the national economy." Chen Yidi and others proposed an amended clause: "The state should provide education, science, art workers, and journalists with convenience in their work, guarantee their livelihood, and increase their remuneration from time to time in accordance with the progress of the national economy." Chen spoke at the podium, believing that the rights and interests of journalists should be included, but because the explanation was too long and the meeting time was limited, the order of the meeting became slightly chaotic. Fu Sinian spoke in front of the loudspeaker upstairs, but there was a lot of noise in the meeting hall. Fu vehemently claimed that the work of journalists was not done for the country and did not need to be included. After a vote, the amendment was rejected as a minority, and the journalists listening in the audience were all deeply disappointed. Subsequently, Bao Mingshu and others proposed that the words "journalism" should also be added to the clause. Bao said during the explanation that he was only arguing for these two words and asked everyone to show leniency, but ultimately it was rejected as a minority, and the original proposal was passed by a majority. Journalists were not included. Regarding Article 161, Wang Bosheng also suggested adding the word "art," but the result was that the original proposal was passed by a majority. Regarding Article 162, Zheng Manqing and others proposed adding an item under the first item of the article: "Domestic private medical businesses that perform well." The reason was that medical businesses were related to national health, and the annual amount of Western medicine imported into China was particularly alarming. In order to save the situation, the above article should be added. Fu Sinian refuted it, talking about the impropriety of traditional Chinese medicine. After his speech, a vote was taken, and the amendment was rejected as a minority, and the original proposal was passed by a majority. At that time, Ding Zhongying, a representative of traditional Chinese medicine, stood up in his seat and shouted, "Chinese medicine practitioners are also Chinese people, this is simply an insult to Chinese people, we are all Chinese people." His voice seemed to have a sense of sadness, and his attitude was extremely indignant. He immediately left with three or four other people in protest. Finally, the two additional articles proposed by the Eighth Review Committee were discussed: (1) Article 140, (2) Article 147, both of which were passed without objection. The Deputy Secretary-General announced that the second reading would be held in the afternoon.

[Our Yangzhou Dispatch] During the period when the counties in northern Jiangsu were controlled by the Communist army, all legal tender was plundered. Although most of the counties belonging to the Yangzhou, Huai, and Xu areas have been gradually recovered, the people's livelihood is declining, rural areas are bankrupt, and there is a severe shortage of currency in the market, making circulation difficult. The economic situation has almost fallen into chaos. It was previously learned that relevant individuals from the Xu and Huai areas have specially organized the "Huaihai Xu Area Economic Revitalization Promotion Association" and submitted a request through the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters to the central government, requesting that financial institutions be quickly restored in the recovered areas of northern Jiangsu to handle agricultural loans, emergency relief, and small-scale loans. In addition, a banking group organized by local firms in Huaiyin will apply for loans from national banks in order to revive the local economy. The reporter recently approached an official from the financial sector who is about to go north for inspection to inquire about this matter. According to him, in addition to the Central Bank setting up branches in Yangzhou and Xuzhou, preparations are being made to establish branches in Huaiyin, Xinpu, Qingkou, and other places.

Regarding the financial measures for the pacification zone, since being approved by the Supreme National Defense Council, the Agricultural Bank of China has drafted measures for small-scale loans in northern Jiangsu and submitted them for approval. Currently, in order to meet actual needs, it has been decided to set up loan agencies in Gaoyou, Baoying, Taixing, and other places first. Once approved by the Executive Yuan, lending can begin. The amount has been approved at 300 million yuan per county, with an initial amount of 12 billion yuan temporarily set.

### Changshu Normal School Students Cause Trouble, Destroying Post Office and Assaulting Postal Workers

[Our Changshu Dispatch] The Beishixin Post Office here was suddenly attacked by Tian Weijun and other students from the National Normal School at around 10:00 AM on the 22nd, who destroyed doors, windows, and public property and violently assaulted postal worker Xue Jinfu, causing him to be injured. The situation was serious at the time, and postal services were suspended for a time. The incident was triggered by the students' insistence on paying less postage for a registered airmail package of printed matter to Chongqing, leading to a dispute. Xue then leaned his head out of the window and pointed to the postage table posted on the window, asking them to refer to it. Unexpectedly, the student, without asking for the reason, slapped Xue's cheek with his left hand. Xue, caught off guard and insulted, negotiated with him. The student then broke the glass attached to the postage table with his right hand. Yao Jinnan, a letter carrier from the post office, heard the noise and came to investigate, saying that compensation should be paid. The student pretended to agree and immediately wrote a note, instructing fellow student Yang Huaiqin to take it back, gather a crowd, and arrive at the post office, shouting loudly, dragging Xue out of the office and surrounding him to beat him. The second door of the post office was also broken. As a result, the student Tang Zunwen, who caused the trouble, was arrested. Bureau Aber and two others were taken back by the school, expressing their apologies. The bureau made the conditions of compensation, apology, and a guarantee that similar incidents would not occur in the future. All parties are mediating. After the incident, the public found it difficult to understand the crude actions of the Normal School students.

[Our Suzhou Dispatch on the 24th] Aside from the four cinemas and one opera house in the city that remained closed today due to the bloodshed caused by the conflict between Suzhou’s wounded soldiers and the city defense troops, the overall situation is improving. Both sides are displaying normal composure. The city defense department stated yesterday that the two missing soldiers have returned to their posts.

The proposals were then reviewed and revised at a temporary meeting of the County Administration Review Committee yesterday, and sent to the county government for reference.

### Ningbo Land Registration Begins

[Our Ningbo Dispatch] Land surveying and registration in this county had been underway for several years before the occupation. As a result, many landowners possess certificates and title deeds.

Recognizing this, the provincial land administration bureau ordered the Zheng County government to quickly establish a land registration office and appointed Yan Shengjie, chief of the Land Administration Section, as director. It has been learned that the land registration office has now been formally established. All landowners who held various certificates and deeds before the occupation are required to submit these documents, along with other proof, for registration within the specified general registration period, so that official certificates can be issued to protect property rights.

### The Seventeenth National Assembly - Smooth Second Reading of the Constitution Draft

(Continued from yesterday's first edition) Subsequently, regarding the proposed addition of clauses, Zhang Yuanyang and others proposed amendments, arguing that since the title of Chapter 12 had been amended, and this spirit was based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, especially the importance of exercising civil rights, the text should clearly define the rights of recall, initiative, and referendum. After Zhang's explanation, a vote was taken, but the proposal received only a minority of votes and was rejected. The original five proposed amendments were revised into three amended articles, which were passed based on the integrated committee's revision. Article 133 had amendment suggestions from Dai Xiujun and others, who proposed further amending the previously amended article. Dai Xiujun explained the proposal, but it received only a minority of votes and was rejected. The original amendment was passed. Article 134 was passed without objection. Article 135 had amendment suggestions from Zhao Zimao and others, who proposed changing "army" to "armed forces" in the original clause "No party or individual may use the army as a tool for political strife." They argued that no party or individual should use the army as a tool for political struggle, and other public forces and local teams should not be used for political struggle either. After Zhao Zimao's explanation, a vote was taken, and the proposal was passed by a majority. Article "136" was passed without objection. Article "137," which included a clause on respecting treaties and the UN Charter, had two proposals from Pan Chaoying and Wang Zhiyuan. Pan's proposal argued that the clause "respecting the UN Charter" should be deleted. The reasons for the original proposal were listed in five points, which were explained at length, taking up a great deal of time and causing a stir in the hall. There was a sense that he had to step down, and he left the podium amidst the ringing of bells. Hu Shi then took the podium and explained that the original draft's inclusion of the phrase "respecting the UN Charter" had been well-received worldwide, and deleting it would create great misunderstandings. It had already been amended to "respecting treaties and the UN Charter," and deleting it again would be another mistake. He stated that Pan's arguments were completely unfounded, believing that treaties could be modified, but the Constitution could also be modified, and the UN Charter was not easily modified. He concluded by urging everyone to respect the integrated committee's amendments and not make another mistake. Hu's speech was powerful, eloquent, and garnered much applause. Chen Guyuan then attempted to speak, but the majority felt that further discussion was unnecessary, and the hall became chaotic. Chen briefly expressed himself in a few words, saying: "We don't need to worry about the UN Charter being temporary, we should consider it long-term." A vote was taken, and Pan Chaoying's proposal was rejected. Wang Zhiyuan's proposal, which also aimed to remove the phrase "respecting the UN Charter," was rejected as well due to the UN Charter's temporary nature and the belief that China's constitution should not be bound by it. Ultimately, the integrated committee's amendments were passed by a large majority. Article 138 had three proposals from Xue Mingjian, Ma Xuchang, and Liu Ziya. Xue's amendment argued that the article should be simplified and follow the original draft. Ma's amendment sought to revise Articles 228 and 139, deleting Article 139 and adding "The methods shall be determined by law" after Article 138. Liu's amendment proposed adding the following clause after this article: "The currency system shall be based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principles of currency reform. Its implementation plan shall be determined by law." The original proposers of all three proposals provided explanations, but they were all rejected by a minority vote, and the original amendment was passed. Article "139" was passed without objection. As the time reached 6:00 PM, the meeting was adjourned. The second reading continued until the 24th before it was completed.

### Zhuang People's Boundary Demarcation Opinions

The newspaper sent a message from Songjiang on the 9th: Regarding the opinions of the vice speaker of the Songjiang Temporary Consultative Assembly, Zhang Shizhi, I have to say something. I use the position of the residents of Xin Zhuang, where the dispute lies, to express my humble opinions and ask for advice from wise readers.

Since the Republic of China for sixteen years, Xin Zhuang has been designated as part of the Shanghai Provisional Receiving Area. There are records, case files and charts of the demarcation approved by the Executive Yuan and the Municipal Government at that time, which can be used for reference. It is not a continuation of the activities of the enemy puppet period, which is very clear. In the autumn of the thirty-fourth year, victory and peace were achieved, and the national territory was restored. Song County itself has thousands of things to be governed, and Xin Zhuang is regarded as an abandoned baby, especially the issue of education related to the rise and fall of the country, which has never been taken care of. Today, a year later, after all educational administrative facilities have been handled effectively by the Shanghai Municipal Government, it is only then that they know to recover jurisdiction. How can there be such a reason? Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s plan for Greater Shanghai. In the beginning, it did imply locking the economic lifeline of the rented territories. After the recovery of the concessions after the war, the original plan certainly needs considerable changes. However, Shanghai's status is due to the insincerity and non-cooperation of the domestic Communist Party, and other ports lack security and flexibility. It is clear that it is more important than before the war, and the population density has increased. The facilities of a big city are like this. As the director of the Municipal Works Bureau, Zhao, said in a special article (see this year's June 30th "This newspaper's forum on Saturday, must meet the needs of national defense, economy, culture, industry, commerce, transportation, and other aspects. Therefore, the regional issue in the current Greater Shanghai plan is not only not satisfied with the recovery of the commercial area of the leased area, but also requires more expansion than the forecast before the war. Xin Zhuang is an ideal good residential area, and it is also an important part of the future urban highway network. Its position is almost the same as the Xianggu area before the war. The opening of Zhongshan Road and Pudong Avenue, the construction of the administrative district, residential area, and Qiujiang Wharf in the city center, all illustrate the general implementation of the Greater Shanghai plan before the war. Today, it is necessary to continue to promote the request to receive the temporarily postponed area according to the needs of the facts. This is a matter of reason. The second and third points raised by Vice Speaker Zhang are obviously not facts. Moreover, this request for receipt is exactly the step of fulfilling the Executive Yuan's approval in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China. His fourth point is "...It should also be ordered by the Ministry of the Interior of the Executive Yuan to delineate it. There is no previous explicit text..." The remarks are even more contradictory. In short, under today's circumstances, what the people expect is to revive construction, live and work in peace. Whether it is a city or a county, it is a local agency of the country. There is no distinction between relatives and enemies. What is contested is the trend of the people's hearts and the people's opinions. Those who are close to the people will win the people's hearts. It has been the case since ancient times. The people of Songjiang County are not as benevolent as the people of our country, so they should not be loved by our people. All the facilities in Shanghai City do their best regardless of borders, so they have won the support of our entire public opinion. It's really not an accident. (Quei Shuikang)

### Discussion on the Changshu Levy Procedures

In Yuyi County, there is a distinction between rented and self-operated property in terms of field tax. More than 70% of the county's rented households are rented, and less than 30% are self-operated. About three-quarters of the rentiers live in the city. This year, the field tax has been changed to in-kind, and it has been changed to zonal collection. The original intention was to facilitate the people and pay nearby. However, there are eight districts in the whole county, and four warehouses are set up in each district, and the notice only has the fields, the name of the district where it is located, and no explanation as to which warehouse a certain map should pay to. I am afraid that the consideration to facilitate the people and pay nearby will be counterproductive. Here is an example to prove it: Suppose there is a rentier household with fields scattered in eight districts, and each warehouse must pay. If one person is used to specialize in this matter, and one place is paid back and forth to the city for three days, then the 32 places in the whole county will take more than two months, and the freight and personal food and accommodation expenses are considerable. Therefore, I have repeatedly asked the Tianliang Office to improve the levy method as soon as possible. All the landlords in the city should pay to the warehouses in the city. If the string is scattered in the district, the collection warehouse will issue a temporary receipt. After the rural area invites the Tianliang Office to return the grain strings of the households in the city, those who hold the temporary receipt will exchange the stamped strings with the Tianliang Office, which will be convenient for both the public and the private sectors, so that the people will be spared extra losses. (Wang Zhen)

### Pray for the Zhenjiang Junhua Hall

There is no one in Zhenjiang who doesn't know that the Junhua Zhishen Hall is a local charitable organization that pities the poor, helps the needy, and helps the needy. The Shantang was founded by local philanthropists Yu Xiaoquan, Cao Qing, and Sun Jingzhi. It is a treasure trove for the poor and a savior for the poor. Before the Anti-Japanese War, they would issue rice tickets and money tickets during the cold season of the year, and distribute cold clothes and rice porridge, so that the general poor and helpless people could maintain a difficult winter. Since Zhenjiang was looted by the enemy, compatriots in this huge provincial capital were massacred. The situation at that time could not be described in words. Under the arrogance of the enemy, the executors of the church were selfless and buried the dead to avoid the scattering of white bones. The spirit of fraternity is worthy of respect. At that time, the hall accommodated a large number of refugees, about 1,000 people. Fortunately, the winter relief rice was able to eat three meals a day and barely survive. Those who were rescued still sing praises of their merits. This year, war broke out in Jiangbei, and more than 10,000 refugees from northern Jiangsu fled to Zhenjiang. The hall selected those who were lonely and unable to make a living, and rescued them one by one. It also stipulates that in the morning, steamed buns are distributed, and rice porridge or rice is given in the middle and late hours, so that the people in northern Jiangsu are spared starvation. The church has more than 30 branch halls in the north and south of the Yangtze River, specializing in helping the world and cultivating blessings, and spares no effort to help the poor. I was requested by the authorities of the church in the 28th year of the Republic of China, and I took the job of making a list and conducting household surveys. I saw that the general poor people were able to get real benefits in great hardship. All the expenses of the hall rely on local merchants to help as they wish, and do not solicit donations from people. However, prices have soared in recent years, and it is expected that the expenses of the hall will feel exhausted. Now it is the season of severe winter, and the drums of the twelfth lunar month are urging the remnants, and those who have no clothes and no clothes are everywhere. I deeply hope that people in the sea can give direct and enthusiastic assistance to the church, so that benefiting the people is more meaningful than any good deeds! (Ma Xiezong)

### Appeal for Airport Land Rights

I have lived in Wumajiazhai, southwest of Longhua, for generations, engaged in both commerce and agriculture, and I have been self-sufficient. In the spring of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, the enemy army expanded Longhua Airport, and all my cultivated land was occupied. The houses had not yet been affected. By the spring of the 34th year, the houses had also been affected by the expansion. Although it is called price collection, how much can it be? However, under the pressure of coercion, I had to move painfully. In total, there were more than 2,000 households and more than 30 villages that suffered the same harm for two years, with more than 5,000 oak houses and more than 5,000 acres of land. In the autumn of last year, the victory was announced in the Anti-Japanese War, and the sky was restored to light. I was able to revisit my old residence, but the land expanded in the 33rd year could not be used freely because it was occupied by the enemy, and it was dug and built into a city, and I could not cross into it. Now the land is still occupied by China Central Two Airlines. According to the construction of Longhua Airport, it was used by Eurasia Airlines, and it was rented from local people and paid considerable rent. Now China Central Two Airlines occupies a huge airport, but no money has been paid. I have been notified by the Municipal Land Administration Bureau that the owners must pay land price tax. I think there are obligations only after there are rights. Now that the right to use the land has not been recovered, it is ordered to pay the obligation of tax. I feel that I can't bear it. However, because the title certificate is still in my possession, I paid part of the tax. How should China Central Two Airlines, which actually uses the land, reduce the burden on me and many land owners? I read in the newspaper that the second meeting of the Municipal Council is about to be held. I hope that the councilors will raise the meeting for discussion to find a reasonable solution and to help the people of Su.

### Please send traffic police to McKen Road

I am a student at Hengfeng Road National School in the city. I have to go through the road between Wuding Road and McKen Road every day to go to school. This is the McKen Road station. Trucks loading goods are constantly driving fast, regardless of the safety of pedestrians. There are no traffic police here. Today, when I was going home at noon, I was hit by a speeding truck and lost my life. However, because there was no post police, it was allowed to drive away. I fainted for a long time, and my classmates helped me to school. I would like to ask the police authorities to add post police between Wuding Road and McKen Road to maintain traffic and ensure the safety of a group of young students (Zang Daohong, a student at Hengyueshou National School).

### Shuangqiao people demand a station

The Sujia Highway was opened on December 18, which is convenient for the people. According to reports, the price of millet from Jiaxing to Shuangqiao is 700 yuan. Unexpectedly, tickets for Shuangqiao are not sold. You can only buy tickets for Wangjiangjing. Therefore, the fare will cost twice as much. Why is there no station in Bianqiao before the war? I hope the Road Bureau will quickly add a Shuangqiao station to avoid unnecessary sacrifices in terms of materials and time for us! (Xia Songnian).

### Discussion on handling Chongming Zhaosha

"A Record of Tianji, North of the Ming Dynasty" is detailed and thorough in the description of Qingbi, and it is indeed worthy of being the mouthpiece of the public. I am an old Miao, and three generations of grandparents have lost a lot. Now that it has risen again, the property rights naturally exist in law and in reason. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the provincial government went to the border area of Suyuan to liquidate the isolation. The said students were reported and led by a small number of people. Now that the provincial government has found out the truth and revoked it, it is the most wise. However, how to dispose of it after the revocation has not yet been announced. According to the said beach, as of today, it has been nearly 10,000 mu, and there is a trend to expand northward. If the mainland of Jiangbei rises rapidly, then this good field will be a national defense fortress. The old Miao only owns a strip north of Wanggong Embankment (named after Su's supervision of Wang Dankui's construction during his lifetime). After that, there will inevitably be incidents of sand disease and gangsters who seize the species without authorization. If so, then the sand field disputes will never end. The fighting in the autumn of this year may only be the prologue to a bloody tragedy. I deeply believe in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings of "equal land ownership" and "cultivators have their fields". I deeply hope that the provincial and county governments may as well use Wanmu Liangsi as a trial area for the implementation of the new land system, which is convenient for the country and the people. I ask the high authorities, is it so? (Chongming Sharen)

### France Adopts Strong Policy to Maintain Interests in Vietnam; Leclerc Rushes to Vietnam to Oversee Military Affairs; Our Consul General Requests Neutral Zone, French Side Agrees

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 14th] At 9:00 AM on the 23rd, the Chinese Consul General met with community leaders in the Sino-Vietnamese region to discuss establishing a neutral zone with the leaders of the Vietnamese resistance forces. French General Morlière fully agreed to open a neutral zone to concentrate overseas Chinese and peaceful Vietnamese. Overseas Chinese shops in the French-controlled area have resumed business. The overseas Chinese are very satisfied with the efforts of the French authorities and the Chinese Consulate.

[United Press, Paris, 23rd] Today, French forces in Vietnam, under the cover of aircraft and tanks, advanced on key routes in Hanoi to control Tonkin. However, the war now threatens to spread immediately to Cochinchina. If this occurs, the entire Vietnam will be engulfed in gunfire. Interim Prime Minister Blum reported to the parliament that the situation in Vietnam is serious, perhaps worsening, and explained that a firm policy of response has been adopted. General Leclerc, a renowned military expert in mechanized warfare, is being dispatched to the front lines to take charge. French authorities in Hanoi accused the Viet Minh of massacring French civilians, claiming that 29 dismembered bodies were discovered, including eleven women. Mr. D'Argenlieu, the French High Commissioner to Vietnam, has arrived in Saigon. Local French military authorities greeted him at the airport, but D'Argenlieu made no statement upon arrival.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] Prime Minister Blum made a statement in the National Assembly today, reaffirming the policy advocated three days ago by Colonial Minister Moutet. In short, the Blum cabinet will defend France's interests and protect French nationals. For security and defense purposes, military measures are unavoidable, but there is still hope that the policy on territorial alliances stipulated in the new constitution can be realized one day. From the perspective of French interests, opposition is expressed to the violent methods of the Viet Minh. However, the current governmental system does not believe that military means can solve everything. Although Blum has clearly taken all precautions, he also acknowledges that the old system of military colonialism is no longer applicable today. People from all parties have failed to fully understand this dual approach, leading the right wing to denounce it as a policy of concession that has caused the current situation. Conversely, the extreme left believes that the agreement signed with the Viet Minh Republic on March 6 has not been fully implemented by the French military authorities in Vietnam, but the National Assembly does not seem inclined to embarrass the government at present. The government's two actions have created a good impression in the parliament: first, Blum's opinions are completely consistent with those of High Commissioner D'Argenlieu to Vietnam; and second, Blum has dispatched General Leclerc, a famous French general of World War II, to Vietnam on Wednesday to preside over the situation.

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 23rd] Colonial Minister Moutet departed from here today for Karachi, India, en route to Vietnam to investigate the Franco-Vietnamese conflict. He is expected to arrive in Karachi at 8:00 PM tonight.

### French Forces in Nghệ An Surrender

[Reuters, Paris] Yesterday's news: French authorities in the port of Vinh, Nghệ An, Annam, have obeyed the Viet Minh's ultimatum and surrendered to avoid the slaughter of French residents. A dispatch from Hanoi also states that all of northern Vietnam is now affected by the war. Although French forces in three cities near Hanoi, including Nam Định, are besieged, they continue to fight hard. To date, French forces in Hanoi have suffered 50 deaths and 150 injuries.

[United Press, Saigon, 23rd] The French Commissioner's Office and the Cochinchina Autonomous Government issued a joint announcement today, stating that Cochinchina is under attack by the Viet Minh.

[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] Well-informed sources in Paris say that French reinforcements are being urgently dispatched to Vietnam, and other troops are also preparing to depart at any time.

### Vietnamese Resolve to Fight a Long and Bloody War; Preferring Death to Slavery; Viet Minh Government Issues Declaration; Accuses France of Bearing Responsibility for the War

[United Press, Saigon, 23rd] Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Vietnamese People's Republic, issued his first declaration yesterday after fleeing with government officials to Bắc Ninh, 15 miles northeast of Hanoi, after the outbreak of war last Thursday. He stated that the Vietnamese people would rather die than be slaves and are determined to wage a long and bloody struggle for freedom, "The 20 million Vietnamese will eventually annihilate 100,000 reactionaries." Ho attributed the responsibility for starting the war to the French authorities, accusing them of widespread arrests and implementing a policy of terror in Tonkin and Cochinchina, and of using aircraft to bomb women and children.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] Mr. X, the representative of the Viet Minh Republic in France, issued a statement stating, "In the name of the Viet Minh Democratic Republic, we are willing to cooperate fully within the French Federation, based on the agreement signed between France and Vietnam, to defend the independence of the Viet Minh and the unity of its nation." President Blum met with representatives of the Franco-Vietnamese Association today to discuss the matter. Furthermore, Mr. Y, the spokesman for the National Assembly's Military Budget Committee, stated that there are a total of 82,000 French troops stationed in Vietnam.

### France and the United States Discuss the Situation in Vietnam

### World's Attention Turns to Antarctica; Competition to Form Antarctic Expeditions

[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] The base of the British Antarctic Mawson Expedition will retreat to another base 300 meters away at the request of the US State Department, for use by the US Antarctic Expedition led by Lieutenant General Byrd. This base was originally established by Lieutenant General Byrd during his expedition to Antarctica in 1944. Lieutenant General Byrd has now left the United States and will meet with other ships at sea to travel to Antarctica. In addition to Britain and the United States, Norway, Sweden, and Australia, Chile and Argentina, may also have plans to explore Antarctica.

[United Press, Philadelphia, 23rd] Another Antarctic expedition team led by US Navy veteran Luo Nuo, consisting of 20 people, will depart from New York by ship next month for a 13-month expedition. The ship will be equipped with a cosmic ray telescope, shaped like an oval cake, which will begin operating when the expedition ship departs and continue to explore cosmic rays until its return, with significant discoveries expected. It is reported that the Batou'er Foundation used a Super Fortress for cosmic ray exploration flights in June this year, and the telescope was designed by the Foundation.

### British Colonial Office Announces Draft Constitution for Malaya; Overseas Chinese and Indian Trade Unions Express Opposition

[United Press, Singapore, 23rd] The British government today announced a draft organizational law for the Malayan Union, in order to politically unite the previously loosely connected states and British Malaya. Military and diplomatic affairs of the Malayan Union will remain under British jurisdiction, as the rapid occupation of Malaya by the Japanese army in the early stages of World War II greatly embarrassed Britain, forcing it to take this as a warning. The draft constitution stipulates the following: (1) A central government will be established, presided over by a special commissioner appointed by the British monarch; (2) Federal citizenship rights will be extended to the majority of the people; (3) The Malayan Union will be composed of nine states and the colonies of Penang and Malacca. There should be a joint Federal Legislative Council and an Executive Council, and state governments should be established, presided over by local chiefs, with local British commissioners as advisors. This draft constitution was drawn up by a drafting committee composed of representatives from the British government, the chiefs of the states, and the United Malays National Organisation. It has been approved by the chiefs of the states and the British Cabinet and will now be submitted to Indian residents, overseas Chinese, and other ethnic groups for approval. However, the newly formed Pan-Malayan Joint Action Committee has opposed it. The committee is composed of 15 overseas Chinese and Indian trade unions, and its opposition is based on the fact that the draft constitution was established in secret meetings without seeking the opinions of the Malayan people beforehand. The draft constitution does not mention the status of Singapore, which will remain a British colony or the location of the Governor-General's Office. The Governor-General's Office will likely continue to govern Malaya, Sarawak, and British North Borneo. People from the states of Malaya, British people born in Penang or Malacca who have resided there for more than 15 years, British people born in the Malayan Peninsula whose fathers were born locally or resided there for more than 15 years, and anyone whose father was a citizen of the Malayan Union at the time of their birth can obtain federal citizenship. The British government will be responsible for protecting the Malayan Union, preventing its peace and tranquility from being threatened, and maintaining the financial stability and credit of the Federal Government.

### France's New Budget; Military Spending Not Reduced

[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] The French House of Representatives met tonight to discuss the budget and approved the item for military spending in the ordinary budget, totaling 41 billion francs, as well as the item for reconstruction funds in the special budget, totaling 35 billion francs. This budget is for the first three months of the next year. The military spending item has not been reduced compared to this year, because the situation in Vietnam is unstable, so reducing it is temporarily not being considered. Finance Minister Fei Lie Pu said that the ordinary budget can now be balanced, all because 50,000 civil servants will be laid off, and the amount of income tax will almost double. Financial experts say that the ordinary budget is balanced not because of the reduction of government expenditures, but because of the increased tax burden on the people.

### British Mathematicians Design and Manufacture Automatic Computer; Complex Problems Can Be Solved in Minutes

[United Press, London, 23rd] British mathematicians are designing and manufacturing an automatic computer, whose computing speed is equal to or even surpasses that of the famous American electronic computers, and can calculate more complex problems. When using an electronic computer, the keys must be continuously turned according to the calculation problem. The automatic computer uses a type of card inserted into the machine, with holes punched on the card, like a password. Complex math problems that take several hours to solve with an electronic computer can be solved in just two minutes with an automatic computer. Electronic computers only record 200 decimal places, while automatic computers can record up to 15,000 places and can solve equations with more than 50 or more than 100 unknown factors. This machine will take two or three years to manufacture and will cost more than £100,000 (equivalent to US$400,000).

### Myanmar Constitutional Discussion to Be Held in England at the Beginning of the Year; Myanmar Leaders Not Optimistic About the Prospects of Negotiations

If the negotiations fail, we cannot avoid being driven into an inevitable path. Although we know that our strength is not enough to resist airplanes, artillery, and bayonets, we are confident that our position is just and our demands are reasonable. This is a permanent force. We are determined to fight to the end with that kind of force. We do not doubt the sincerity of the British Labour Party government, but the reactionaries in Britain and Myanmar have considerable power, so we expect that we will hardly achieve our goals without struggle.

### Four Unlikes; Four Heads Shipped to New York

Horns Like Deer, Head Like Camel, Feet Like Cow, Tail Like Mule

[Central News Agency, New York, 23rd] Four rare Chinese elks (pere david's deer) were recently shipped from England to the New York Zoo. These monsters were originally raised by the Duke of Bedford in England and were named "Father David's Deer," and were obtained through negotiations by the New York Zoological Society. The shape of the elks is not very beautiful. The horns are like deer, the feet are like cows, the head is like a camel, and the tail is like a mule, so they are called "four unlikes." In 1866, a Catholic priest named David preached in China. David was a naturalist who knew that the imperial garden contained elks. He tried to obtain several and transport them to Europe, naming them Father David's Deer in memory. At the beginning of the 20th century, all the elks in Beiping were killed by the army, and those in Europe gradually decreased to seven. The Duke of Bedford bought them all and bred them to 250. The elks' first link to the United States. The animal scientist hopes that the four elks shipped to the United States can be greatly bred in the future.

The Egyptian government is currently studying this request. However, according to well-informed sources, Egyptian authorities are deeply concerned that if the request made by Britain is approved, it will create a dangerous precedent. In addition, it has been learned that British Ambassador to Egypt, Sir Campbell, held a lengthy meeting with Egyptian Prime Minister Noki, exchanging views on the British-Egyptian negotiations.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 24th] The Foreign Office here recently confirmed that the head of the British delegation, Stansted, will soon go to Cairo to conduct revisions of the 1936 British-Egyptian treaty.

### The Second Post-War Christmas Offering: May Peace Prevail Throughout the World (Continued)

In the aftermath of the war, the situation in the Near East remains unstable, and peace has not yet been restored in the Far East. Let us hope that Christmas brings the gospel of peace, so that all people on earth may receive grace…

[United Press London, 23rd] Sixteen months after the end of World War II, conditions in Europe and the Near East are turbulent, and peace has not been restored in the Far East. The following is a snapshot of various Far Eastern countries during the second post-war Christmas season.

Philippines: Constabulary forces are trekking through the rugged mountains of central Luzon to suppress guerrillas. The guerrillas are referred to as rebels, and the result of the campaign over the past few months is that more than two thousand people have died. The guerrillas were formerly the "People's Anti-Japanese Army," and its members are rich in guerrilla warfare experience. They oppose overthrowing the government by violence but insist on agricultural reform.

India: The Congress Party, led by Hindus, insists that an independent India should be a unified republic with Hindus in the majority party position, while the Muslim League demands separate governance for Muslim-majority provinces. Added to other religious and political factors, the situation is even more complicated. British authorities estimate that since the British government announced the plan for Indian independence in May of this year, the number of people killed due to Indian-Muslim conflict has exceeded ten thousand. No fewer than fifty thousand British troops stationed in India have been deployed to try to suppress the riots.

Netherlands East Indies: Although a ceasefire order has been issued after several negotiations between the Dutch and the East Indian independence army, there are still minor conflicts in Java and Sumatra from time to time. As a result of the negotiations, a draft political agreement was established, stipulating the establishment of an independent United States of East India within the Dutch East Indies Federation. The Dutch East Indies estimates that approximately nine thousand one hundred troops are stationed in the old boundaries before the Allied withdrawal, possessing tanks and aircraft. On the East Indian side, the Javanese forces number one hundred and forty thousand, of which about half are armed; Sumatra has three divisions, of which seven-tenths are armed. The continued conflict is due to four reasons: (1) sixteen months of hatred has not been eliminated; (2) insincerity, with most soldiers on both sides opposing a peaceful resolution and desiring a military solution; (3) the East Indian authorities have no binding force over irregular guerrillas; (4) the Commander-in-Chief of the Army should, for military security reasons after the withdrawal of British troops, advance the Dutch front line by about one mile, which the East Indian side considers to be a violation of the ceasefire agreement.

Vietnam: The French army and the Vietnamese independence army are still at war, and the ceasefire order in October was ineffective. Fighting is fierce in some locations. It is reported that the French army has a well-equipped force of 50,000, with a small number of aircraft and small gunboats. The Vietnamese army includes regular troops, militia, and young conscripts, and appears to outnumber the French army. The French side claims that there are Japanese soldiers within the Vietnamese army. The Vietnamese army possesses mortars, machine guns, and a small number of cannons. The center of the dispute is in Cochinchina. The Vietnamese side demands that Cochinchina be incorporated into Tonkin and northern Annam to form the territory of the republic, while the French side insists that the two regions should be separate. Last week, the Vietnamese army re-launched the war in Hanoi and Tonkin. French authorities claim that 29 civilians, including 11 women, have been killed, and their bodies were cruelly dismembered. The French side has declared martial law in Tonkin and southern Annam. It is also reported that more than 200 French soldiers have been killed in recent battles.

### Concealing and Trading Enemy and Puppet Materials: All Cases Will Be Under the Jurisdiction of the District Court Hereafter; The High Procuratorate Directs the District Procuratorate to Investigate the Wang Binpei Case According to the Interpretation of the Judicial Yuan.

[Our Newspaper] Since the signing of the Potsdam Agreement, the people's concealment or purchase of enemy and puppet materials should be separately established as a kind of crime under criminal law, which has been interpreted by the Judicial Yuan Xie Zi No. 3250. However, in the past, such cases were all prosecuted by the High Procuratorate according to the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, and the cases were under the jurisdiction of the High Court. Now, there is a case in which Wang Binpei colluded with Japanese people to conceal and sell several properties after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. According to the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan, the High Procuratorate specially instructed the District Procuratorate to investigate the case according to law. Hereafter, such cases will be investigated by the District Procuratorate first according to the crime of species, and will be handled by the District Court.

### The Goods of Yongye Rice Store Were Confiscated; The Municipal Government Ruled to Revoke the Punishment; The Case Was Transferred to the District Procuratorate for Joint Judgment According to Law.

[Our Newspaper] It was reported in July of this year that Chen Zhangshi reported Yongye Rice Store for hoarding food rice for sale on the black market. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau learned through investigation that the store was a member of the Flour Industry Association and started business on December 21, 1945. However, it has not yet registered with the food authorities as required, and the rice that is sold together with the flour is not listed in the store, nor is it prepared with account books in accordance with the regulations, and the quantity, name, and price of the buyers are never recorded. The Social Affairs Bureau confiscated seven shi and five dou of white rice and nine shi and five dou of brown rice stored in the rice store in accordance with Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Food Crimes in Extraordinary Times. The rice store refused to accept the punishment and filed an appeal with the municipal government, putting forward five reasons:

(1) Brown rice cannot be sold in this city and cannot be regarded as hoarding. (2) Small shops are accustomed to only recording the total account and not keeping a daily account of customers. (3) The crime is considered inappropriate. (4) Applying for business registration through the association is not illegal. (5) The Social Affairs Bureau is violating the law and trampling on the common people. After the appeal was submitted to the municipal government, the respondent authority submitted a response together with the case file. Recently, the municipal government ruled that the main text: "The original punishment is revoked, and the part of the appellant's hoarding of food rice should be transferred by the original punishing authority to the District Procuratorate for joint judgment according to law." Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau transferred the case to the District Court Procuratorate. According to the municipal government, this case is the first case to accept an appeal and revoke the original punishment after the victory.

### The Executive Committee of the Import Control Committee Resolves on Two Important Cases

The Executive Committee of the Import Temporary Management Committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 5:00 pm in the Central Bank Building. The meeting lasted for more than an hour, and the results were announced as follows: According to customs regulations, goods should be declared and picked up within 15 days of arrival at the dock. If the goods are picked up after the deadline, a fine should be imposed according to the regulations. The Import Temporary Management Committee, taking into account the actual difficulties in importing, has specially agreed with the customs that if the delay is indeed due to the committee's handling of the audit procedures, the fine for delayed pick-up can be waived.

For goods loaded with domestic products from one port to another, which must be transshipped through Hong Kong to reach the designated destination, no import permit is required. However, when declaring for export, the cargo owner should provide the customs of each port with a true settlement of equivalent cargo value to prevent abuses.

### Xujiahui Cathedral Requests Illumination

Xujiahui Cathedral once gave up a portion of its land to build Rue de la Mission, and all the streetlights on the road were supplied by the church. Because this road is an important traffic artery in Xujiahui, with constant traffic of vehicles and pedestrians, it has now been converted into a highway. The church believes that it is no longer obliged to provide streetlights, and because of the restrictions on the amount of electricity used since the regulations were implemented, the church itself does not use much electricity, making it even more difficult to supply. In order to maintain public security and avoid traffic accidents, the church is now requesting the Public Utilities Bureau to quickly supply electricity and install streetlights to facilitate winter security. The Public Utilities Bureau is already working on finding a proper solution.

### The Plan to Build a Greater Shanghai is Being Studied by Experts.

A National Park is to be established in the Taihu Lake area; The area along the Huangpu River in Pudong is to be developed as a residential area.

[Our Newspaper] The Public Works Bureau recently revealed for the first time a 50-year plan to build a Greater Shanghai, covering the Yangtze River, Zhapu, and the Taihu Lake area, at an informal reception for the U.S. delegation. This plan was drafted three months ago and is now being studied in detail by six architects and two engineers of the Urban Planning Committee. Mayor Wu serves as the director of the committee, and Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, serves as the reception secretary.

According to architect Lu of the committee, this plan is divided into transportation, industrial areas, residential areas, and seaports. The purpose is to make Shanghai one of the best cities in the world from both a practical and aesthetic point of view. Shanghai is more convenient than London and New York in terms of urban planning, because there are no restrictions on Chinese-style or valuable buildings. These buildings are obstacles to reform. Most of Shanghai's current buildings are old and dilapidated. The new plan includes appropriate demolition. The meaning is that the city is not squeezed together, but is divided into many independent towns, which are connected to the urban area of Shanghai to form a large city. These towns can be further divided into many neighborhood units, each with transportation links. According to accurate estimates, in the new Shanghai with one million residents in the future, the current urban area of 50 square miles will become the heart of this large city and can accommodate 7 million people. The rest of the population will be distributed in districts, towns, and neighboring areas. Each neighboring area unit can accommodate 400 to 100 residents. Shanghai itself will be separated from the surrounding areas by a ring road and grassland. This grassland will be used for recreation.

The architects of the Public Works Bureau have also carefully considered the design of factory locations to avoid dust and other factors. In the future, Shanghai will expand outward into five districts. Each district will have railways and highways connecting to the heart of the city. These highways will have no intersecting branch roads and traffic lights, so that cars can travel at 60 miles per hour.

The plan also mentioned the current port facilities. It is planned to designate Zhapu as a seaport and Wusong as a river port. Zhapu also has a river channel passing through Longhua, which leads directly to the Huangpu River in Shanghai.

The number of airfields will be reduced from the current five to four. Jiangwan Airport will be moved to Zhabei, and Longhua Airport will be made suitable for runways facing northwest by west. Another airport will be built behind the Zhapu seaport. All airports will be able to undertake international transportation tasks and will be connected to highway and railway networks.

Secondly, a national park will be established in the Taihu Lake area. The north and south of Taihu Lake will be developed into agricultural areas, and the area along the Huangpu River in Pudong will be developed as a residential area.

Engineer Buck, who is currently teaching at St. John's University, supplemented Lu's remarks and pointed out that the Pudong Bridge has been deleted from the plan because it is impractical and too expensive. Buck also had a dissent to the plan, that is, there is too little construction in Pudong.

### "Thank You" Slogan for Ordering a Bill After a Meal; Drop it Into the Mailbox; The Financial Bureau Prints New Slogans to Promote the Collection of Banquet Donations

[Our Newspaper] In order to strictly collect the banquet donation in this city, the Municipal Finance Bureau has printed uniform bills for restaurants and issued them to restaurant merchants for application. Now, it has further negotiated with the post office that after customers obtain the bill, they do not need to add envelopes and stamps, nor do they need to provide an address. They can directly drop it into the mailbox for the Finance Bureau to check.

It is reported that in order to promote publicity universally, the bureau has printed two types of slogans: (1) Please ask for a bill and drop it into the roadside postal mailbox, thank you. (2) You have paid the banquet tax for dining here, please be sure to ask for a bill to take out and help with municipal construction, thank you. These slogans have been handed over to the collection offices in each district, and staff have been sent to distribute them to the restaurant merchants, embedded under the glass table top, or in other places where customers can see them. Notices have also been sent to the two trade associations of the liquor and vegetable industry and the Western food and coffee industry.

### Sketches of Christmas Eve

Yesterday was Christmas Eve, an annual holiday with religious significance. Children are looking forward to gifts from Santa Claus in red clothes and white beard, adults pray that next Christmas will be better, while wealthy families dance and laugh, never tired of pleasure, forming a strong contrast with the starving people wandering the streets. All dance halls are decorated with lights and colors, doing their best to be extravagant, and inserting various entertainment programs to entertain guests. A cup of tea in a dance hall costs between 20,000 and 30,000 yuan. The Christmas meal at Paramount costs 100,000 yuan per person, and the other major hotels such as Cathay and Jinmen cost between 50,000 and 80,000 yuan. Most Chinese restaurants also add tips. Although the prices are expensive, they are full everywhere. If you don't book in advance, you will miss out. Although the police have banned dance halls from operating overnight, there are still many dance halls that are celebrating wildly after midnight. Most Westerners eat turkey at home to celebrate Christmas. The U.S. Army and Marine Corps held Christmas dances. With the music rising, green girls and red men danced and celebrated to their heart's content. However, because the number of U.S. troops in Shanghai has decreased by 80% or 90% compared to last Christmas, it is not as lively as last year. Embassies and consulates of various countries in Shanghai held Christmas receptions. The Argentine Embassy also scheduled a costume ball to be held on New Year's Day, inviting celebrities from all walks of life to participate. The Air Force Xinsheng Society and the Shanghai Branch of the Lizhi Society in Shanghai also held dances to celebrate the winter solstice. All cinemas have increased their prices, but there are not many famous films. "Waterloo Bridge" at Dahua, "A Song to Remember" at Cathay, and "Fantasia" at Haida are the most popular. Because of the arrival of Christmas, prices in Shanghai have risen again and again. Christmas items such as a turkey cost as much as 110,000 to 120,000 yuan, and it is very difficult to buy genuine goods. The sales of foreign wine are also strong, and a bottle of brandy is worth 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Pious Catholics go to the church to "attend Mass" to thank the Lord's grace. Christians have the ceremony of "reporting good news." The song "Ave Maria" and the crisp bells of the church make people feel touched by the scene. The American warship Boston, which is anchored on the Huangpu River, is scheduled to host orphans at 11:00 am this morning, to celebrate the universal joy. In the Hongkou area, small bars and low-class dance halls are places for Allied sailors and people of the middle and lower classes to have fun. The dance music played is the same as in the large dance halls. The song "White Christmas" is the most popular. After the bells rang at midnight, everyone shook hands and wished each other "Merry Christmas."

### Canned Food Prices Surge; Store Owners Smile.

[Our Newspaper] Recently, due to the stimulation of gold prices and the extra demand for the Christmas holidays, the prices of canned food have fluctuated greatly, with increases ranging from 10% to 30% to 40%. Fruit foods have risen less, generally about 10%. Canned milk, milk powder, and foreign wine have fluctuated the most, rising by about 30% to 40%. For example, Klining milk powder, which was sold for 5,000 yuan a week ago, was priced at 8,500 yuan the day before yesterday. However, after the gold price fell yesterday, the market price of canned food also dropped significantly. When the store owners talked about the rising gold price, they couldn't help but smile.

### A Scene in Front of the Police Bureau; An Old Man Leads His Family; Kneels and Burns Incense to Appeal for Injustice; It Is Said That His Young Son Was Framed When Arrested.

[Our Newspaper] At about 11:00 am yesterday, in front of the Police Headquarters, there was a fifty-year-old man leading his family members and children, a total of thirteen people, kneeling and burning incense, shouting that they had been wronged. At one time, there were hundreds of onlookers. Later, the police took the old man and others into the bureau for questioning. It is said that his name is Zong Yukuan, from No. 640 Guihua Road. Recently, his youngest son, Jinfa, was falsely accused by someone to the Putuo Road Police Station, pointing him out as a bandit, and was arrested. A pistol was also found in his home. During the investigation period, his son had already confessed to jointly robbing Shunchang Foreign Cloth Store with his accomplices Yin Kaifa and Zhao Genzhi. However, this fact is an injustice, and he said that the pistol found earlier was deliberately framed by others and secretly hidden in his home. After finishing speaking, the old man burst into tears, and finally took out a petition from his arms, with more than 2,000 words, which was to be presented to Director Xuan. However, after the police officer showed the petition to his superiors, he learned that the case had already been transferred to the Constitutional Office of the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation. As a result, the old man left with his children in frustration.

The settlement period is on the 30th of this month, with each person first receiving 150,000 yuan, and the balance will be paid off before January 10th next year, which has been agreed by both parties.

All the female workers of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company started a strike yesterday morning. After hearing the news, the Social Affairs Bureau sent staff to persuade them, and instructed the female workers there to send representatives to negotiate with the factory. However, the female workers refused to accept it. When asked about the purpose of their demands, some said they wanted a year-end bonus of three or four months, and some said they wanted 300,000 yuan. It was impossible to understand what they wanted. The factory union has also been trying to persuade them without success, and has gone to the Social Affairs Bureau to ask how to handle it. It is heard that the Social Affairs Bureau summoned the person in charge of the company to discuss the matter at about 4:00 pm yesterday.

### Unearthing Secrets with a Mortise Chisel: A Morphine Den Cracked Down in Huangpi South Road, Over a Dozen Men and Women Arrested

[Our Correspondent] Tao De Kui, a 40-year-old man from Haimen, Zhejiang, previously engaged in the charcoal business, had been renting a room at 326 Longgong Hotel, Baxianqiao, Shanghai, for two months. In early this month, Teng Yongxi, Deputy Director of the Putuo Road Branch Bureau, received a tip-off that Tao was suspected of trafficking heroin. He immediately dispatched officers Zhang Xiaolin and Zhao Yongji, disguised, to purchase three small packets of morphine, and arrested him. They also confiscated 30,000 yuan in original legal tender marked with a code. Furthermore, they found twelve packets of morphine in his wife, Tao Zhang's, pocket (five packets containing one qian each, and seven packets containing one fen each). During interrogation at the bureau, Tao confessed that he purchased the heroin from Chen Xinxiang's house at 35 Xihu Lane, West Gate Road, for 50,000 yuan per qian, divided it into six small packets, and sold each packet for 10,000 yuan, making a net profit of 10,000 yuan per qian. Based on the confession, officers Li Xingyuan and Wu Shiling were dispatched to investigate. They found that the

House Was Spacious,
With Only Two or Three Residents. They confiscated 2.6 million yuan in cash on the spot and discovered that Chen Xinxiang had deposited several million yuan into the Jiashan Qianzhuang on Tianjin Road over the past six months. Suspicions arose, and Chen and his wife, Chen Lin, were arrested and taken to the bureau. The branch director, Qi Jingzhi, interrogated them and learned that the heroin trafficking operation was located on Huangpi South Road. Therefore, on the 22nd at dawn, section chief Gu Zhensan, along with police officers Zhou Xuqi, Chen Qidang, Shen Jinyao, Yang Bingsheng, and others, disguised and escorted Chen Xinxiang to 4 Junyi Lane, Huangpi South Road. They brought Zhao Zonghong, a man from Xuzhou, and his wife to the bureau. Meanwhile, plainclothes officers remained at the house to keep watch. Upon arriving at the bureau, they found a

Mortise Chisel
And a paper resembling a receipt next to Zhao's wife, Wang. When asked about drug use, both denied it. Subsequently, Wang was taken back to her home for another search, where three small bags of heroin were found hidden behind the bed in a Ruyi pouch. Furthermore, over ninety Ruyi pouches used for storing heroin were discovered. During strict questioning at the bureau, Wang remained cunning and refused to disclose the source of the heroin, only claiming that her brother, Wang Xingshan, had shipped it from Nantong and stored it at her house. She said Wang resided in room 20 of the Zhonghua Hotel. Officers were dispatched to investigate and arrest him, but no such person was found. Later, branch director Qi Jingzhi and deputy director Teng Yongxi, along with section chief Yin, led officers and Zhao Zonghong, accompanied by officers from the Taishan branch, to 4 Junyi Lane for a

Detailed Search,
Ultimately discovering a secret compartment on the third floor. The mortise chisel found next to Zhao's wife, Wang, was specifically used to open the secret compartment, which contained: (1) A wooden box containing fourteen small bags of heroin, weighing ten liang, and twenty-four liang of raw material including wrapping paper; (2) A porcelain mortar and pestle; (3) Five large and small stamps, and a stamping box; (4) Two biscuit tins; (5) A leather suitcase; (6) Over ten million yuan in checks; (7) A gold bar weighing one liang, and twenty pieces of gold jewelry weighing seven liang and nine qian. With the evidence irrefutable, the house was handed over to his son (Zhao Xiaoyuan, 15 years old) for safekeeping, along with the local Bao and Tian chiefs. Simultaneously, the plainclothes officers guarding the house had also successively arrested Wang Guoliang, Zhu Huangshi, Mao Shenshi, Huang Tongbao, Chen Fengyou, Ji Guangfu, and six other heroin purchasers who came to the house. They were all taken to the bureau for investigation but denied selling drugs. The branch bureau has now detained all the suspects pending further interrogation.

### Want to Buy a New Car? First Ask If You Have Gold Bars: The Latest Black Market Price Survey

[Special Report] Car transactions in Shanghai are calculated in gold bars. A better car can sell for nearly twenty bars. However, there are still people who want them, and demand exceeds supply. Car dealers say in unison: "There is business, but there are no cars." Of course, if you don't care about bars, it's not difficult to buy a brand-new car. Customs does not allow the import of cars with factory prices exceeding 1,200 gold collection units. However, "everyone has seen that there is no shortage of fancy cars on the road." So how did they get in? Insiders say that those who can pull strings have their own ways!

On the one hand, due to customs restrictions on imports, and on the other hand, due to insufficient production in the United States, the number of cars imported this year is only about one thousand. There are less than ten car dealers in Shanghai, distributing products from British and American factories. Due to the above reasons, although orders are very enthusiastic, delivery is quite difficult.

Currently, cars officially imported by customs from the United States cost about US$1,000 at the factory price. Dealers add various fees and profits, setting the price at about US$3,000 to US$4,000. However, the current market price is actually around US$7,000 to US$10,000.

"Buick" cars are quite popular in the market and now sell for 20 bars, with only thirty-odd arriving in total. "Studebaker" has a total of forty vehicles arriving, priced at US$3,000, but the market price is 13 bars. "Ford" arrived in relatively large quantities, priced at over US$2,000, but the market price is also 13 bars. Two "Mercury" cars recently arrived, selling for seventeen or eighteen bars each. As for "Lincoln," it cannot be imported now, so we haven't heard the music-sounding horn yet.

As for small cars, the "Standard" distributed by the Newbell Company had one hundred vehicles arrive. Orders placed previously can all be delivered this year, priced at US$3,600, but the market price is also around ten bars. There are not many Austin cars. Eighty "Fiat" cars arrived, with small and medium sizes, priced at four and a half to eight bars for the larger one. Eight "Chrysler" six-cylinder cars were recently imported and sell for 18 bars. Eight-cylinder "Packards" have also arrived, with market prices exceeding 20 bars.

Therefore, we can now see that car transactions in Shanghai are distorted and unreasonable. You have no way to buy a car at a fair price. Sometimes, when the order arrives, the dealer refuses to deliver the car and must make up for the black market difference before they give you the car.

In addition, some people bring cars directly from the United States because, according to regulations, each person can bring a car as luggage. When these cars arrive in Shanghai, they enter the black market. At the same time, some dealers from other cities also do black market business in this city because Shanghai's market price is too profitable.

In addition to wealthy businessmen, the banking industry buys the most cars. Small cars are mostly purchased by doctors and lawyers.

As for the car industry next year? Almost all car dealers shook their heads. Because of the difficulty of importing, although the amount of American car exports may increase next year, the number of cars in Shanghai will probably be less.

### Gangsters on Fumin Road Shoot and Wound Police Officer, Car Passing by on Nanjing Road Flees

[Our Correspondent] Dou Changtao, a 30-year-old police officer from Anhui, assigned to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, was on patrol duty with police officer No. 675 on Fumin Road at 1:20 AM yesterday morning. When they reached the intersection of Zhongzheng Road, they saw two men who looked flustered. They tried to check them, but one of them drew a gun and shot Dou. The officer immediately returned fire.

Afterwards, No. 675 reported the situation to the branch and immediately sent the injured police officer to the police hospital for treatment. After receiving the report, the branch immediately sent a large number of police officers to the vicinity of the incident to pursue the suspects, but they found nothing. Car No. 14109 was later found at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Huashan Road. The driver, Shi Shen'an, was taken to the bureau for questioning and then released.

### Shanghai Reception Station Reopens to Facilitate National Assembly Representatives Returning Home

### Mayor Answers Three Questions: One Million Dan of Rice Prepared to Be Released, Salaries of Public and Educational Personnel Expected to Be Adjusted This Year, Conscription Considered a Way to Train the Body

[Our Correspondent] Yesterday, reporters visited Mayor Wu and asked about rice prices, year-end bonuses, conscription, and other issues. He gave the following answers:

Question: Rice prices have recently risen sharply. Has the Mayor paid attention to this and sought to suppress prices?
Answer: Black market rice prices have indeed been discovered in the city recently. The reason for the sharp rise is purely due to the influence of foreign exchange. I believe that it will subside in a few days. There is absolutely no problem with rice supply in the city. I still have more than one million dan of rice in my hands, which I can take out when necessary.

(2) Question: What is the Mayor's opinion on the issue of year-end bonuses for workers?

Answer: Regarding the issue of year-end bonuses for employees, the central government has an order stipulating that it should not exceed one month. I also believe that the consequence of high wages is factory closures and worker unemployment. Therefore, I sincerely hope that both labor and management can understand each other. I am delighted with the understanding of the yarn factory workers, who initially requested a year-end bonus of five months, but resolved it with forty days.

(3) Question: Civil servants usually have low salaries and live a hard life. As the end of the year approaches, how can the city government help them?

Answer: Chairman Chiang has issued an order to adjust the salaries of civil servants, and I believe that the order will arrive here within the year. The city will immediately comply with it after receiving the order. If the order is not received by the end of the year, the city government may find a way to temporarily borrow a portion, but it is best not to publicize it in advance, because even if the city government provides subsidies, the amount will be very small, causing everyone to wait with bated breath, and the result will inevitably be disappointing.

(4) Question: Has the city government's budget for next year been completed? What percentage of the budget is allocated to education?
Answer: The budget for next year has indeed been prepared and is currently being sorted out by the accounting office. The total amount does not exceed the possible income of more than 230 billion next year. Educational expenses account for 30 percent of the budget. We must do our best to maintain education.

(5) Question: What is Mayor Wu's opinion on the conscription problem in the city?

Answer: Since Commander Chuan Zhengmo of the Garrison District came to Shanghai, conscription work should be actively carried out. Serving the country is the duty of a citizen, and there is nothing to be afraid of, and it should not be avoided. If I had a child of conscription age, I would definitely send him to the army first, so that he could train his body.

(6) Question: How will the Mayor spend this Christmas holiday?

Answer: Public servants have no entertainment and no rest. If this continues, I'm afraid it's the mayor who will have to implement "labor draft."

### Food Vice Minister Pang Songzhou Returns to Beijing: Talks About Abundant Grain Reserves Before Departure

It is also understood that Pang will come to Shanghai again before the end of the lunar year.

### Business Tax Issue for the Book Industry: Ministry of Finance Agrees to Plan in Detail, Petition Representatives Change Date of Trip to Capital to Early Next Month

[Our Correspondent] The Shanghai Book Industry Guild held an emergency joint meeting of directors and supervisors at its office on Tibet Road Central at 3 PM yesterday. Li Bojia, Zhang Yiqu, Guo Nongshan, Xu Boxin, Yao Pengzi, Liu Jikang, Zhou Xihe, Jiang Zhenzhan, Wang Zicheng, Tang Wendui, and more than a dozen others attended to discuss the request to exempt the book industry from business tax. It was decided that all petition representatives would change the date of their trip to Beijing to January 2 and petition again, to present the actual difficulties and reasons for exemption to the Ministry of Finance. If the goal is not achieved, the entire industry will close down.

Ministry Approval

According to the industry, in order to exempt business tax, it had previously held a temporary membership meeting, and twenty representatives were elected on the spot, originally scheduled to go to Beijing yesterday (24th) to petition. Just as they were about to leave, they suddenly received a reply from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, so an emergency joint meeting of directors and supervisors was convened. The original approval from the Ministry of Economic Affairs was as follows: "The Ministry previously received a submission from Chairman and industry representatives Guo Nongshan, etc., requesting exemption from business tax for the book industry. We have forwarded the request to the Ministry of Finance, asking them to consider the special circumstances of the industry and grant an exemption or deferral. This has been approved and recorded. Now, with reference to the Ministry of Finance's public letter No. Jingzhi 10970 Zi 6104 dated December 5 of this year, it is stated: 'It is noted that the book industry is closely related to education and culture and is extremely important. The book industry suffered particularly heavy losses during the war and it is difficult to recover in a short time, which is a real situation. In order to promote national policy and maintain cultural undertakings, it is necessary to support the book industry. However, there are many types of books, and not all of them are important. If a blanket exemption from business tax is granted, it would be unfair and other industries would inevitably request similar exemptions, affecting tax collection. The Ministry is currently planning a proper solution in detail, and it will be implemented once approved. Therefore, we hereby notify you and instruct you to inform us accordingly.'

Guild Opinion

The Industry Guild had a thorough discussion at yesterday's joint meeting of directors and supervisors. Everyone believed that the reasons listed by the Ministry of Finance were very far-fetched. If the Ministry of Finance is afraid that other industries will follow suit, then the governments of England and France exempt books from taxes but impose heavy taxes on cosmetics, and it has not been heard that exempting books from taxes has caused protests from the cosmetics industry. If it is said that there are many types of books, and it is difficult to determine the standard of which is more or less important, all books with formal publication addresses and publishers have their cultural significance and value. There are varying opinions, and there is absolutely no distinction between light and heavy. As for pornography and pirated copies, in fact, there is no place of publication, and it is impossible to tax them even if you want to. Moreover, textbooks have already been exempted first, and general books cannot be exempted from the list, because books representing the culture of any country are considered general books, not textbooks.

Cultural Loans

To understand the current situation of the book industry, the reporter visited the person in charge of the guild. According to him, among the 268 members of the guild, only a few can barely survive. The vast majority are facing ruin due to high costs, reduced purchasing power of readers, and the pressure of high interest rates. Currently, the best-selling books are pornographic books, and the more unsatisfactory ones are children's books, because the latter are cheap. As for general theoretical and new literary books, they are relatively slow-selling and difficult to win. Due to transportation not having recovered and high postage, there is little hope for expansion in other cities, except for pornographic books. The person in charge said: Culture is the foundation of the country, and the government should be keenly aware. In addition to a complete exemption from business tax, cultural loans must also be provided to save the current crisis in the book industry. It is said that the guild will also have a special submission on cultural loans in this petition.

### Ohlhaver Case: Siebert on Trial, Denies Involvement in Espionage

[Report from our Newspaper] The US Military Tribunal continued the trial of the Ohlhaver case yesterday. The defendant is Siebert, the former German Consul in Guangzhou.

Siebert testified that after the German surrender, his responsibility was to instruct German expatriates in Guangzhou. He admitted that he still retained the title of consul at that time, and his mission for the Axis powers had not changed. His reason was that he had not received a formal dismissal order from the German government. Colonel O'Connor, the prosecutor, immediately questioned him about the meaning of "unconditional surrender." Siebert, who holds a doctorate in law, replied: "Unconditional surrender means that one side of the defeated country surrenders unconditionally to one side of the victorious country."

Siebert further admitted that he knew that Hasse, Ublichi, and Niemann of the Guangzhou branch of the Ohlhaver Bureau continued to engage in espionage activities after the German surrender, but he himself never participated in them. His reasons were fourfold: (1) His superiors had instructed him not to interfere with Hasse's work; (2) Hasse was directly under the command of the Ohlhaver Bureau; (3) His own work was only in the area of German expatriates, while Hasse was working for both Germany and Japan; (4) The Japanese military authorities also instructed him not to interfere with Hasse's affairs.

Vice Minister Qin is scheduled to return to Nanjing tonight to report on everything. If Wang Renshan and others are arrested in the future, Qin will come to Shanghai again to preside over the trial.

The joint trial began at 1 PM yesterday. In addition to Qin Dechun presiding over the trial, Zeng Zhaoyi, Chief of the Military Law Office of the Garrison Command, and Tao Yishan, Chief of the Investigation Office, served as judges.

### Heavy Fog at Sea, Many Vessels Delayed

New Waterway Discovered in the Yangtze River, Long'an Vessel Arrived in Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday

[Report from our Newspaper] Maritime industry sources confirm that due to recent cloudy weather and heavy fog at sea, ships are having difficulty navigating, resulting in delays for most international liners. The General Gordon arrived in port yesterday and docked at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's No. 1 pier. The President Madison, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, has not been seen due to the sea fog. According to the company, it is expected to arrive roughly tomorrow. The cargo ships Fumen Victory and Lotte Slovan Toga are also delayed until tomorrow. The China Merchant Steam Navigation Company also has three ships arriving.

[Another Report] The Yangtze River water level has receded sharply, as reported in previous issues. Yesterday, the Long'an ship of the Sanbei Company reported that the water levels at Daijiasha and Shazhou were between 9 feet 6 inches and 10 feet, making it difficult for ships with a draft of more than 13 feet to pass through. However, it has recently been learned that the customs marker has discovered a new waterway with a depth of 13 feet, so the ship arrived in Shanghai on the 23rd.

### Flood Prevention Plan for Next Year Decided by Public Works Bureau, Improving Ditches and Setting Up Pumping Stations

[Report from our Newspaper] The city's emergency flood prevention project for next year has been planned and decided by the Public Works Bureau and approved by the Municipal Council. The details are as follows: (1) Improve the waterlogging situation near Risheng Building. The construction site is from Nanjing East Road to the Suzhou River. A pumping station will be set up, with a net cost of more than 670 million. (2) Improve the ditches on Jiangsu North Road. The construction site is from Changning Road to the Suzhou River. A pumping station will be set up, with an estimated budget of approximately 580 million yuan. (3) Improve the ditch project in the Wuning Road area. A pumping station will be set up, with an estimated budget of more than 610 million yuan. (4) Improve the ditch project in the Xizang North Road area, with an estimated budget of more than 66 million yuan. (5) Improve the ditch project in Huoshan Road, with an estimated budget of more than 74 million yuan. (6) Improve the ditch project in the Yuyu Road area, with an estimated budget of approximately 273 million yuan. (7) Immediately raise the embankment, with the construction site along the Huangpu River and the Suzhou River, with an estimated budget of approximately 110 million yuan.

The Municipal Public Works Bureau believes that the accumulation of sewage is detrimental to the health of the citizens, so the flood prevention project must be rushed. An entire plan has been drawn up, and it is rumored that the total cost will reach 11.3 billion yuan. However, because the municipal government's finances are extremely tight next year, the expenditure is limited to no more than this year's amount, which is 2.4 billion yuan. The Public Works Bureau will use this as a standard and make the above decision on the emergency flood prevention project for next year, based on the importance of each section.

### Navigation Industry Work Competition to be Implemented Next Year

The Central Work Competition Promotion Committee is promoting the work competition in the transportation industry in Shanghai. The situation in the shipping industry is relatively complex, and satisfactory results cannot be achieved without the full cooperation of officials, merchants, labor, and capital. Therefore, it has repeatedly contacted all parties to organize the Shanghai Shipping Industry Work Competition Steering Committee. The inaugural meeting was held at 3 PM on Monday of this week in the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's conference room. The seven units participating in this organization include the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and the shipping industry, marine engineers, drivers, and the China Seamen's Association. It was decided that the competition items should be simple and easy to implement. For the time being, the three items are navigation safety, fuel conservation, and schedule accuracy. The competition will be based on ships as units, and it is stipulated that all ships of 500 tons or more must participate in the competition. The competition standard will be based on the record of the three months after 1946. Rewards: For the outstanding personnel participating in the work competition, in addition to the committee requesting the Central Work Competition Promotion Committee to award prizes and gifts at the National Work Competition Award Ceremony on May 5th each year, the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau intends to request the Ministry of Communications to approve the competition results as one of the standards for the assessment and promotion of marine engineering drivers. The fuel saved will be purchased by the shipping company at a discounted price for rewards. The various associations will promote it separately, and it will be implemented at the beginning of 1947.

In August, taking a cold shower caused pain in the muscles on the back of my left thigh and calf. After being diagnosed by a doctor at the Central Hospital, he said that it was caused by an injury to the lumbar spine, with something protruding and pressing on the nerves in my left leg. Surgery was required for recovery, but the results of the X-ray failed to reveal the source of the illness, so it was abandoned. Later, I changed to the Department of Neurology for examination, but the source of the illness was not revealed. The symptoms are still the same, I often suffer from insomnia at night, my appetite is poor, my hands and feet are numb, and I am very mentally distressed. What disease am I suffering from?

### Production Loan Amount Undetermined, Will be Approved Individually According to Actual Needs, Emphasis on Post-Loan Assessment to Prevent Malpractice

Chairman Huo Speaks to Reporters

[Report from our Newspaper] In order to make all sectors understand the progress of the work of the Provisional Review Committee for Production Loans of the Four Joint Offices, Chairman Huo Shitse held a reporter reception at 11:30 AM yesterday at the China Bank on the fourth floor. Mr. Huo addressed as follows:

The establishment of this committee aims to cooperate with the government's import management policies, assist in the turnover of production funds for factories, gradually solve their current difficulties, and achieve the goals of increasing production and post-war economic recovery. Previously, President Song came to Shanghai and repeatedly discussed with leaders from all walks of life, and decided that the Four Joint Offices would hire the chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the banking industry association, representatives of the Municipal Government's Economic Department, and 12 people in charge of national banks and bureaus as members, in order to unify the forces and jointly plan the implementation. In the past ten days, the work has gradually been launched. The important matters are reported as follows:

(1) Work Overview: This committee was established on the 10th of this month, and holds regular meetings every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday to review applications and discuss various important issues. So far, five regular meetings have been held, and important regulations have been formulated. For example, the "Instructions for Applying for Loans," "General Rules for Loan Review," and "Measures for Handling Loan Cases" have been published. All application forms have been rushed to be printed and distributed to national banks and bureaus and commercial firms for factories to collect and fill out.

(2) Application Procedures: This committee accepts applications from factories, not from industries. Because the quality of each industry varies, we must make some choices and assist the healthier ones. In order to effectively use the country's limited resources, in principle, we hope that the application will be transferred by the bank that has business dealings with the factory. Because only the bank that has business dealings with the factory knows best about the factory's credit and its financial needs.

(3) Loan Terms: The loan interest rate has been reduced to 4% per month, and the loan ratio is 50%. Machinery and factory buildings can be used as collateral.

(4) Loan Amount: The amount will be determined individually based on the actual needs of each factory, and no amount has been predetermined. It is impossible to estimate in advance without the application from each industry. All kinds of figures circulating outside are speculation.

(5) Approval Procedures: If each applicant factory can prepare the necessary forms in accordance with the regulations of this committee, the preliminary investigation and review, and the approval by the meeting can be completed within one week. Cases that have been decided by the meeting and handed over to the bank for processing must also be signed and reported within three days. In short, the handling of loan cases is always done as quickly as possible by this committee and the banks. We hope that each applicant factory will read the application instructions carefully in advance and complete the necessary procedures. At the same time, provide convenience to the investigators and provide the necessary information, so that delays can be reduced.

(6) Post-Loan Assessment: In the past, national banks were very strict in the pre-loan review, but the post-loan assessment was too lenient, which easily caused malpractice. This time, this committee attaches equal importance to the pre-loan review and the post-loan assessment when handling production loans. Therefore, it is stipulated that the lending bank will send personnel to audit the borrower's use of funds, and this committee will set up a roving audit to conduct random checks at any time to ensure that the loan is used for production. In the future, if anyone is found to be cheating, the competent authority will be asked to punish them severely. We also hope that the public opinion circles will express correct opinions and effectively restrain them. The reasons for the current industrial crisis are varied, such as high interest rates, high wages, the competition of foreign goods, transportation difficulties, and the decline in purchasing power, which cannot be solved by the financial side alone. The Central Government is aware of this and has consulted with the relevant competent authorities to plan countermeasures to overcome the difficulties. If each factory can make good use of the loan, improve technology, reduce costs, increase production, and improve quality, and lay a foundation for itself, then economic recovery can be expected.

Finally, Mr. Huo answered the questions raised by the reporters. The main points are as follows: (1) The organization of this committee is mainly based on the Central Bank, supplemented by the three national banks and one bureau, and commercial firms. (2) Applicants must truthfully disclose their own illnesses, especially the production costs, so that the committee can prescribe the right medicine. (3) The amount of loan applied for must be reasonable. For example, it was recently discovered that the total annual sales of a factory were only 800 million yuan, but the amount of the loan applied for reached tens of billions of yuan. This phenomenon should not exist, otherwise, it will only prolong the time for investigation and review. (4) The investigation work is currently divided into two parts. The investigation of business and financial aspects is entrusted to the Joint Credit Reporting Center. The technical aspects are entrusted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for investigation.

### Increased Pressure, Tightening of Money Supply, Gold Price Continued to Fall Yesterday, US Dollar and Hong Kong Dollar Also Fell Slightly

Under the circumstances of continued pressure and extremely tight money supply, the gold price continued to fall yesterday. The opening price in the morning was 3.7 million, but it was difficult to find a buyer. A transaction was only made at 3.68 million. For a while, the selling pressure was overwhelming, and the supply was surging. It immediately went downstream and broke into the 3.6 million mark. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank distributed 55 taels at a price of 3.55 million. After entering, the buying interest was even more sluggish. The Central Bank recklessly exerted pressure, and the money supply was tightened. It was difficult to rise after the fall. It once broke into the 3.4 million mark, and then stabilized slightly, but it was not easy to maintain at around 3.45 million. At noon, it struggled at 3.42 million. In the afternoon, the spot settlement market was mediocre. After 3 PM, scattered buying suddenly had a misunderstanding and once approached the 3.5 million mark. However, due to the continued pressure, it finally remained at 3.43 million. As a result, it fell by another 200,000 compared to the previous closing. The price of jewelry gold fell by 370,000. The price of silver dollars rose again. The black market interest rate was even tighter, rising to about 20%.

The foreign exchange also fell yesterday. The US dollar was sold at 7,000 yuan in the morning, and gradually weakened, falling to a low of 6,500 yuan at noon. The exchange rate stabilized slightly in the afternoon, hovering between 6,600 yuan and 6,800 yuan, a continued decrease of 200 yuan compared with the previous closing.

The Hong Kong exchange rate fell from 1,380 yuan to 1,330 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was 1,650 yuan, and the British exchange rate was around 21,500 yuan. Transactions were still more active in the Hong Kong market, and the rest were sluggish.

### Government Bonds Fall Back

Government bonds also fell yesterday due to widespread panic. Tongbing opened at 1,400 yuan, with a low price of 1,380 yuan. After that, there was short covering activity, and it gradually rose to 1,630 yuan. However, people were still uneasy, and it finally fell back to 1,420 yuan.

### Silk Prices Plunge

Yesterday, the price of gold plunged, which led to a collapse in confidence and a decline in the market. D-grade raw silk opened at 5 million yuan, and spot goods were priced at 4.8 million yuan, with a few deals. The price fell by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan compared to the maximum price on the previous day. There were no transactions in dried silk, etc. People in the industry were still bearish, so the market was unusually quiet yesterday. Due to the abundance of spot goods, 120-count rayon yarn also declined. Toyo Brand was offered at 600,000 yuan in the market, and Takayama Brand was offered at 460,000 yuan. Dull rayon opened at 3.8 million yuan, a decrease of 50,000 to 80,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Rampant Smuggling in South China, Tung Oil Supply Obstructed

[Report from our Newspaper] Due to rampant smuggling in South China, the supply of tung oil in Shanghai has been affected. It is reported that not only the tung oil produced in Fujian is transported to the south, but also the tung oil that used to be concentrated in Wenzhou, which was usually transported and sold to Shanghai, is now all exported through Hong Kong. For this reason, the Bureau of Social Affairs invited the China Vegetable Oil Factory, the Shanghai Paint Industry Association, and the Tung Oil Industry Association to hold a discussion meeting yesterday to discuss countermeasures. They unanimously agreed to send a letter to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to try to stop smuggling to the south.

### New Regulations on Cotton Cloth: Private Cotton Mills Would Rather Shut Down Than Accept, Unable to Agree to Government Regulations on Purchase Quantity and Profit

[Report from our newspaper] The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Industry Association convened a temporary members' meeting of Shanghai yarn factories yesterday. More than 30 representatives attended, chaired by Mr. Wang Qiyu. First, it was reported that the 17th Spinning and Weaving Control Committee, based on Premier Song's six-point instructions on cotton cloth control, resolved a new method to stabilize yarn prices. The main points are as follows:

(1) For yarn factories that have purchased foreign cotton or intend to purchase foreign cotton, the government will purchase half of the cotton yarn produced from today. If they weave the cotton yarn into cloth themselves, the government may purchase their cotton cloth.

(2) The purchase price, except for 10% of each factory's production volume, will be sold to the government at cost. The remaining 40% will be priced at cost plus a legal profit of 22%. The above price will be determined by one representative appointed by the Yarn and Cloth Control Committee, one representative from the Spinning and Weaving Construction Company, and representatives from private factories, reviewed and approved by the Weaving Review Committee.

(3) The remaining yarn and cloth, excluding those purchased by the government, will be centralized by each factory for open trading in the market (Shanghai plans to use the old site of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange). The names, amounts, and uses of the buyers and sellers in the above transactions shall be compiled into a detailed table and submitted to the competent authority for review on a daily basis.

(4) The government will use all the purchased yarn and cloth to balance yarn and cloth prices. If the above allocated price exceeds the purchase price, the government will deposit the surplus in a special account for subsidizing cotton production and developing the textile industry.

(5) Hereafter, 70% of the yarn and cloth made from cotton purchased with foreign exchange supplied by the government will be purchased by the government; 10% of which will be sold to the government at cost, and 60% at cost plus a legal profit of 22%. Yarn and cloth made from domestically produced cotton may be bought and sold independently according to the third item.

(6) This method will be terminated when the market price of yarn and cloth is relatively stable.

After the chairman's report, the attending members discussed the new method in detail. The main opinions were summarized into three points: (1) Disagreement with the first item of the new method regarding the government's purchase of half of the spun cotton yarn and cloth. (2) The profit provisions in the second item of the new method will not be discussed for the time being. (3) Disagreement with the fifth item of the new method, insisting that the amount purchased by the government should not exceed 50%. It was also believed that if the new method was fully accepted, it would be tantamount to a bill of sale, and they would rather shut down completely than accept it casually.

However, the administrative authorities also have their own difficulties. That is, within six months after the new method is implemented and before the new cotton arrives, the government must purchase 33,000 bales of cotton yarn nationwide and 24,000 bales of cotton yarn in this city. Only by controlling the price with quantity can the effect of stabilizing the market price of yarn and cloth be achieved. Since the government has opened up foreign exchange for American cotton to supply private yarn factories with cheap raw materials, it should have the right to make reasonable purchases and coordinate distribution to increase the benefits of the general public.

### Fourth Round, Fourth Allocation of Yarn for Reproduced Goods Industry: Overdue and Not Yet Distributed

The Fourth Round, Fourth Allocation of Yarn by the Yarn Allocation Committee of the Municipal Cotton Yarn Reproduced Goods Industry Association was originally scheduled by the Spinning and Weaving Control Committee to be reviewed and allocated on the 23rd of this month. However, the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association failed to complete the procedures by the 23rd, resulting in no allocation. It was supposed to be handled on the 24th, but it was still not allocated yesterday afternoon. It is rumored that the Sixth District Association has petitioned for an adjustment of the negotiated price.

### Slight Drop in Oil Prices, Firm Rice Market

The rice market saw a total arrival of over 12,000 stones from the north and south. Due to high prices in the interior, northern japonica rice was not profitable and the source was scarce, resulting in very little trading. Southern japonica rice was still available and the supply was normal, with transactions completed at the reviewed prices. White silver dollars were still rarely exchanged. There were no formal transactions for indica rice. Soybean prices fluctuated. Small black beans showed a slight increase. Northeastern soybeans fell back by over 1,000 yuan. The market for raw peanuts turned weaker outside the port, falling back by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Sesame fell by 1,000 yuan. Broad beans remained scarce and prices stable. The purchase of young corn stalks was strong, continuing to rise by over 1,000 yuan. Red sorghum prices rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan due to demand from wineries.

### Year-End Approaching, Increased Purchases: Prices of North and South Goods Rise

[Report from our newspaper] The recent rise in gold prices in the North and South goods industry has stimulated people's minds, with many purchasing for storage, and business is excellent. Marine products and imported goods have risen in price by 50% to 70%. In addition to the stimulus of gold prices, there is also the impact of talk about import restrictions. In fact, from January 5th next year, American ships will be carrying large quantities of marine products to Shanghai. The prices of northern goods have also risen by about 20% due to the stimulus of gold prices. Xu Boliang, the executive director of the South Goods Industry Association, told reporters that the prices of North and South goods have risen by an average of 4.3 times this year. Due to the current economic climate, the industry may have a slight surplus this year. The industry once experienced a labor strike during the year-end bonus period, but it was short-lived and resolved in one day. It has now been decided to issue an additional month's salary as a year-end bonus.

### Wavering Bullish Sentiment: General Decline in Yarn Prices

Yesterday, the yarn market saw a continued sharp fall in gold prices. Bullish sentiment among people in the industry wavered, and they rushed to the market to sell, lowering prices to seek sales. The market was completely depleted. Customers also watched with folded arms due to tight funds. Prices of all kinds of yarn generally fell by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan, and the trend still seemed fragile.

### Slight Rebound in Sugar Prices

Yesterday, the sugar market had already rebounded. The association's trading of spot raw sugar saw a slight increase of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, raw brown sugar a slight increase of 10,000 yuan. Guang merchants offered over 200 bags of Runde green sugar at 127,000 to 128,000 yuan, up 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Jian merchants' Diaoqing sugar was still firm due to scarcity, opening at 128,500 yuan, and Zhang red sugar at 142,000 yuan. Other sporadic transactions also saw a rebound.

### Tea Market Remains Quiet

The local market for foreign firms' current year's new tea, which is sold at high prices, remains quiet. However, export firms recently plan to dabble in Wenzhou Xin Zhenmei tea. Unfortunately, since this type of tea was swept away by the Wuchang Tea Company some time ago, the stock is almost exhausted. Therefore, even if there is a small amount of inventory, the sellers are reluctant to part with it as it is rare, so transactions have not been concluded. On the other hand, the turnover of better quality old tea is not slow, and the process is firmer than before. The price of fried green rough tea also frequently tends upwards. The price of new Zhongmin fried tea has risen by 10,000 yuan to around 120,000 yuan per dan.

### Tianbao Feng Silver Shop Announces Liquidation

Tianbao Feng Silver Shop, located at No. 437 Henan Road (intersection of Nanjing Road) in the city, yesterday entrusted lawyers Chen Xintian and Ma Shuyong to formally announce liquidation on the grounds that the shop's manager, Zou Renji, suddenly disappeared. All creditors and debtors are required to register within seven days from today, in order to be dealt with separately in accordance with the law.

### Coal Market Turns Soft

The coal market for bituminous coal has become more relaxed recently as controls by the Management Committee have eased. Huainan coal and other types have continued to be transported from Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and other places. After purchasing allocated coal, various factories are also selling to the market at high prices to adjust their cash flow, so the market situation has gradually softened, and market prices are showing a slight decline. For anthracite coal, Qing Hongji lump coal is still firmly above the 1 million yuan peak. Jiaozuo coal and other types have seen a slight decline. Various coal ball manufacturers have reported that the market for anthracite coal dust is shrinking significantly. However, the owners are still trying to hold on, and the price is still outside the 400,000 yuan range.

### Tight Money Market: Problems with Exchange Occur Frequently

In recent days, the price of gold has soared. Almost all capital in the city has been gambled in a last-ditch effort. After the Central Bank forcefully sold over 10,000 taels in the past two days, the money supply tightened by over 40 billion yuan. Therefore, yesterday, the money changers all felt the pressure of tight funds. There were many difficulties in balancing exchanges. Some sold gold to the Central Bank to make up for the deficit, but most did not have major problems.

### American Flour Arrives in Shanghai

However, among them, the fine striped spring silk (13/15 denier) was originally limited to 500 dan. The full amount has now been delivered. Because the manufacturers requested continued procurement, the China Trust Bureau has agreed. Yesterday, the bureau sent a letter to the China Silk Company, agreeing to continue procuring another 100 dan, with January 12, 1947, as the effective date. After receiving the letter, the China Silk Company will attach 40 dan to the eighteenth batch to be delivered within a few days.

### Yunnan Trade Association Cables Request to Save Economic Crisis

[Report from our Kunming, 24th] The Yunnan branch of the Import and Export Trade Association believes that the high cost of exporting agricultural and mineral products due to transportation obstacles in Yunnan has greatly affected foreign trade. The economic crisis urgently needs to be saved. It has requested the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to allow the continued use of the old "import and export linked method," whereby the amount of foreign exchange earned from Yunnan's exports can be used to purchase goods of equal value on the market, and to exempt restrictions on categories, in order to encourage exports with import profits.

### Ministry of Education Formally Abolishes National School Fund Incentive Law, to be Handled by Applying the Donations for Education Example

[Report from our Nanjing, 24th] The Ministry of Education believes that the incentive measures for raising funds for national schools and township central national schools promulgated during the war are no longer applicable. The amount of incentives determined according to the living conditions in 1939 and 1940 is very small. If incentives are given according to this amount, it will not help the situation. If the amount is increased by a high multiple according to the current price situation, the government does not have such a large amount of dedicated funds. Therefore, it has formally abolished the measures. It is reported that after the abolition of these incentive measures, if someone raises funds to run a school, they can apply the examples of donations to education and be given honorary rewards and certificates.

Mr. Chen Linsheng Comments on Ball Skills

In addition, in the Jingwu Cup Fifth Individual Championship, the ball skills of the five group champions have all reached a wonderful state, especially Wang Youxin, who is good at fast drawing. Chen Linsheng (judge of this championship) of the Golden Dragon Table Tennis Team commented on the five group champions as follows:

Wang Youxin

Specializes in drawing, fast and powerful, both positive and negative are excellent, especially the backhand, fast shot, crisp and clean draw, good at running, is currently the best drawer in the table tennis world. His strong opponents are Xue Xuchu and Chuan Qifang. Xue Chuan has temporarily retired for some reason. Mr. Wang can be invincible, and it is not difficult to fulfill his long-cherished wish for the championship in this session.

Zhang Fuwei

Both drawing and cutting are long, and both are excellent. He is very serious during the game. He draws more than he cuts, especially the positive draw is powerful. He became famous earlier than Wang Youxin. Currently, his ball skills are slightly inferior. If he can be humble and not arrogant, he can compete with Youxin and Kaiyun.

Yang Kaiyun

Good at attacking, beautiful posture, very steady drawing, not good at back drawing, eats less, cutting is also good, but lacks spin. The advantage of being able to counter-attack when cutting, he does not practice often, and his ball skills have not regressed, he is also a genius.

Li Zhen

Proficient in cutting, not flashy, [blank] the ball high and low, fast and slow, can be handy, but the cut ball is quite high, easy for the opponent to draw, fortunately, relies on its tenacious nature to fight, often able to turn defeat into victory, calm attitude during the game, is his advantage.

Zhang Shanda

All-around attacker and defender, tall and thin, takes advantage of attacking. Zhang is a newcomer. He was included in the third group to compete this time, and he defeated the seeded Wu Zuochang, defeated the veteran Shui Hangao, and won the championship. It can be said that he made a splash. Zhang's rise is really the only gain of this cup competition.

### A Study on Christmas

From the newspaper archives.

Every year on December 25th, the whole world celebrates to commemorate this great savior of humanity – Jesus.

In the Bible, there is a record about the birth of Jesus Christ:

Before Mary, the mother of Jesus, was married to Joseph, she suddenly became pregnant, which was caused by the Holy Spirit. When Joseph heard the news, although he was unwilling to humiliate her publicly, he was also unwilling to take her back as his wife. He secretly planned how to divorce his fiancée. While he was thinking, he suddenly had a dream that told him that his wife was pregnant because of the Holy Spirit. The child to be born would save the people and get them out of their sins. He is the savior of the nations of the world. He should take her as his wife without any more doubts. At the same time, he was told to name the child Jesus when he was born. After Joseph woke up, he did not doubt it at all, and followed the instructions in the dream to take Mary as his wife. But he did not consummate the marriage until the child in her womb was born.

Not long after Joseph and Mary got married, the governor Caesar Augustus suddenly issued an order, calling on the people of the world to return to their respective cities to register. The two of them also rushed from Nazareth in Galilee to Bethlehem, the city of David, to register. At that time, Mary was about to give birth. When they arrived in Bethlehem, they could not find an inn, so they stayed in a stable. Mary gave birth there, wrapped the newborn child in cloth, and placed him in a manger, naming him Jesus.

After Jesus was born, the wise men of the East saw the stars at night and came to find him. They found Mary and the child, knelt down to worship him, and offered gold, frankincense, and myrrh as gifts.

At that time, in the wilderness outside Bethlehem, there were large flocks of sheep guarded by shepherds, who took turns guarding them at night. One night, an angel suddenly descended, revealing a dazzling light, which frightened the shepherds. The angel said to the shepherds, "I am here to bring you good news. Do not be afraid. Today in the city of David, the Savior Christ of the nations of the world has been born. You will find a baby wrapped in cloth and lying in a manger. That is him." After saying this, a team of heavenly soldiers, surrounded by angels, ascended to heaven. In the clear sky with bright stars, it was vaguely possible to hear the sound of praising God.

Early the next morning, the shepherds followed the angel's words and rushed to Bethlehem, where they found Mary and Joseph, and saw the baby. The angel's words were confirmed. Soon, the news of the birth of the Savior Christ spread from the mouths of the shepherds throughout the city of David.

The above is the record in the Bible about the birth of Jesus, which does not specify the day on which Jesus was born. It is said that the day the shepherds came to bring good news was December 25, so this day was designated as Christmas, but this day is not the day Jesus Christ was born.

Regarding the date of Jesus' birth, there were several different sayings before the fifth century. One said it was January 6, another said it was March 25, and another said it was December 25. In the fourth century, the Romans decided to set December 25 as Christmas, and the date of Christmas was thus determined. In addition, there are two other textual researches: one said that the date of Jesus' birth should be calculated using the Hebrew calendar, which should be April 20. Another said that according to the Egyptian calendar, it should be May 20. It is difficult to say which calendar should be used to determine the original date of Jesus' birth. Even the year of Jesus' birth is still controversial. The earliest was Exgos, who estimated that his birth year was 753 in the Roman era, which is the Gregorian calendar that is currently used. However, later scholars believed that Exgos's estimate was wrong. It should be four or eight years before the AD. There are still disputes about the year of birth, so the date of birth is of course even more impossible to determine.

Since the legend of Christmas is not easy to determine, there is another more rounded saying, which is not based on historical research but is conjectured from the process of social evolution. Every winter, all European nations have a same festival season, where people celebrate wildly. Later, Christians used this festival to celebrate Christmas in order to replace the original [blank] medicine. Fortunately, most people are just having fun in the name of Christmas, and it seems insignificant what day Christmas should be. Therefore, in the customs of celebrating Christmas in Western countries, many ancient national festival pastimes can still be found.

### Christmas Food: Turkey

Whenever there is a festival, there are always some seasonal foods. For example, rice dumplings for the Dragon Boat Festival and moon cakes for the Mid-Autumn Festival. As for the winter solstice, the Chinese usually grind flour to make rice cakes, while Westerners celebrate Christmas with turkey as an indispensable seasonal food. This is similar to the Chinese and Western ways, and it can be said that "every holiday season makes you think more about 'eating'."

Christmas is Near, Prices are High

Turkey is an indispensable dish in Christmas feasts, and its value is not less than our country's bird's nest and shark's fin. Turkey is also one of the gifts that people give each other. On the eve of Christmas, the price of turkey rises immediately, becoming "ten thousand times more expensive," and the poor can only drool at the windows. I remember last Christmas, there were not many turkeys in stock, the price was high, and it was not easy to buy. Smaller restaurants could not meet the market demand, so skillful chefs had to make fake turkeys out of chicken.

Let's first describe the beauty of the turkey:

The turkey is also called the tu hum chicken. It is tall, about three feet tall for the male and slightly smaller for the female. The upper beak has a caruncle, which can be stretched freely. When stretched, it is two or three inches long and hangs down under the mouth. The color is red and green, which is very pleasing to the eye. The "charming body" is too heavy, the movements are slow, the meat is very plump, and the taste is exceptionally beautiful.

Special Vessels Purchase Turkeys

In the United Kingdom, every year when Christmas is approaching, a large number of turkeys must be purchased from Southeastern Europe. Special vessels to Yugoslavia often number 150 to 200. Most of the turkeys in Shanghai come from Dinghai. Before the war, more than 30,000 turkeys were shipped from Dinghai every year. It is said that farmers in Dinghai started raising turkeys after the Opium War during the Daoguang period. The British occupied Dinghai, and there were many turkeys in the military camps. After the British army left Dinghai, they left the turkey breed. The local farmers thought that the turkey had a unique shape and full muscles, so they kept them and raised them. The output increased year by year, and it became a specialty of Dinghai.

Raising Turkeys is Not Easy

However, raising turkeys is not easy. After the turkeys hatch, the chicks are difficult to keep alive. They will die if they smell oily odors, which is much more difficult to raise than Chinese native chickens. Moreover, the best food for turkeys is grains, but due to economic reasons, the villagers mostly let them eat grass outside. Therefore, Chinese turkeys are not as big as American turkeys. American turkeys usually weigh more than 20 catties each, while Chinese turkeys weigh only more than 10 catties at most, and usually only four or five catties.

If we can use scientific methods to raise turkeys, and the government can provide convenience to marketers as much as possible, it will not be difficult to compete with imported products. I believe that this move will not only supplement the livelihood of farmers, but also promote domestic production and make up for loopholes. Why not encourage it!

### Christmas Tree

When celebrating Christmas, a Christmas tree is an indispensable decoration, hung with lights and ribbons, creating a very beautiful atmosphere. Jesus often taught people to do good deeds and bear much fruit, so displaying this radiant tree during Christmas is in line with his teachings and carries profound meaning.

However, when it comes to the origin of the Christmas tree, it wasn't Christians who first came up with it. Its origin is debated, with various conflicting accounts.

Some say that Germans love outdoor life, so during their festivals, everyone would hang lights and ribbons in the forests, and men, women, old and young, would revel there. This was a way of celebrating. Later, other countries gradually followed this celebration method, and Christians also imitated this custom to celebrate the birth of Jesus. Some, because there were no forests nearby, would try to dig up a tree and carry it home, decorating it with lights and ribbons. Later generations continued this practice, calling it a Christmas tree.

Another account says that it was Saint Boniface who came up with it. Once, when he was cutting down a large oak tree in the forest, a gust of wind swept through, and all the trees were blown down, except for a small fir tree that stood firm. Saint Boniface then declared it a sacred tree. From then on, it was used as a decoration during Christmas.

Another story says that Martin Luther, wanting to show his children the scene of snowy trees under the starlight, cut down a small fir tree in the garden, placed it in the house, and lit candles on it. That day was the eve of Christmas, and later generations continued this custom.

Also, the holly used during Christmas has a very early origin. Ancient Romans used laurel branches as symbols of peace, victory, and happiness. Later, Christians followed this tradition, decorating windows with laurel branches. The English replaced laurel branches with holly, the meaning of which is: the white flowers of holly symbolize Christmas, the red berries symbolize the blood shed by Jesus for sinners, and the holly wreath represents the crown of thorns worn by Jesus during his crucifixion (From our Newspaper Archives)

### Deep into Tai Lake to Investigate Bandit Activity - An Interview with General Mao Sen

— Special Correspondent Wu Shouren

Suzhou, 16th

Since cracking the shocking nationwide kidnapping case of Rong Desheng, the "King of Flour," Major General Mao Sen's reputation has soared, becoming almost universally known. In September of this year, the Wuxi Command Post was established, and he was honored with the new appointment of Chief of Staff, taking on the heavy responsibility of ensuring the security of the Jiangnan region.

Major General Mao Sen Talks About the Great Jiangnan Suppression Campaign

At 2:30 PM on the 7th, the special car of the "Qiantang" brought Major General Mao from Wuxi to Suzhou. It was the reporter's first meeting with him. The first impression was of his forthrightness and sincerity. The second impression was that his short and stocky stature was not as imposing as I had imagined. His handsome face, accentuated by a straight nose, high cheekbones, and deep-set eyes, with thick, dark eyebrows, made his large eyes appear particularly spirited. His slightly pointed mouth and full forehead fully revealed that he was a capable man who was good at thinking and commanding.

Major General Mao Sen did not stay in the urban area of Suzhou. He only delayed for a few minutes for initial greetings and to state the request to follow him deep into the Tai Lake water area. The car immediately took us towards Mudu Town. The 27-mile road journey took 40 minutes. During this free time, the reporter had a wide-ranging conversation with Major General Mao. He cared about everything in Suzhou, such as the integrity of officials, military service, military discipline, and people's livelihoods, inquiring about them in detail. The reporter knew that Major General Mao was burdened with not only security responsibilities but also his original position. If a specific term had to be used to describe this original position, then the four characters "pacification and inspection" seemed appropriate. Because Major General Mao had the task of pacification and inspection, his inquiries were certainly not ordinary social pleasantries, nor did he expect to hear embellished praise, which can be asserted. Therefore, the reporter tried his best to concisely talk about the local situation as far as he knew. He expressed great surprise and concern about the trend of Suzhou's commercial economy nearing collapse. He paid particular attention to the fact that more than 300 grain businesses had closed down in the past three or four months. The reporter certainly would not give up this most opportune time to conduct an interview, so he raised many questions about the process of the Jiangnan suppression campaign and the security situation. Major General Mao, except for questions about figures because he did not have his files with him, answered very frankly. He stated with great certainty that there were no organized bandits in the Jiangnan area, and the scattered bandits on the run would not exceed 500 at most. To eliminate these approximately 500 scattered bandits, he planned to implement joint defense among the counties after the work in each suppression area was completed, intercepting and encircling them to thoroughly annihilate them. After concluding his answers, Major General Mao expressed his insightful views on the key points of pacification work, saying, "To thoroughly achieve the effectiveness of pacification, it is not possible to achieve complete success by relying solely on suppression forces. When I launched the great Jiangnan suppression campaign, I ordered the commanders of each suppression area to take appeasement as the first step in promoting the work. Secondly, strengthen local self-defense forces and improve the Baojia system in each county. These are measures that are above armed suppression." Indeed, "attacking the heart is paramount." If a broad people's movement can be launched in addition to suppression and appeasement, then the achievements of each suppression area will inevitably become greater and further lay the foundation for long-term stability in Jiangnan.

When the car arrived at Mudu Town, the sky was gloomy, and drizzling rain rose in the northwest wind. All the officers of the Tai Lake Suppression Command, except Commander Chuan Jingfang, who had gone to Zhangzhu in Yixing to concurrently serve as commander of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui border suppression area, and Deputy Commander Liu Hongde, who was in Shanghai on official business, lined up at the bus station to welcome us, starting with Chief of Staff Yang Zheng. A large crowd of Mudu locals also gathered, their curious eyes flashing outside the temporary cordon, competing to admire Major General Mao Sen's demeanor. In the light rain, we walked towards the command post. This was an old residence located on East Street in Mudu, with very sturdy construction and very wide and deep houses, probably the former residence of local gentry. It was very clean and tidy, showing no signs of being used by a military organization. In the general office, the heads of each department presented their work reports separately. General Mao listened while flipping through the tables and forms, sometimes making concise inquiries, looking very relaxed and at ease while using his ears, eyes, and mouth simultaneously.

Scattered Bandits Re-emerge in the West China Peninsula

After nearly three months of combined suppression and appeasement in the Tai Lake area, the major bandit groups have either surrendered or been brought to justice. The only ones still resisting are the groups led by Xue Yonghui and Zhou Shiwei, as well as a small number of scattered bandits. The reason why they can reject appeasement and evade suppression, eking out a meager existence in a corner of rural Jiangnan, is that they indeed have some tricks for survival! After synthesizing the results of on-the-spot interviews with local elders, the reporter learned that their style is indeed very different from that of ordinary bandits. For example, Xue Yonghui claims to be the commander of the Tai Lake Military Region Advance Army of the Communist Party. During the War of Resistance, he used the restored West China Peninsula in the third district of Wuxi as his base. He has twenty or thirty henchmen, and they all adhere to the principle of "rabbits don't eat the grass near their own burrows." Although they kill, set fires, and rob far away, they do not commit any offenses against the residents of the West China Peninsula, where they are based. Therefore, the local people basically do not think of them as a gang of robbers. The assessment of land tax and other donations that they provide is considered by the people to be an inevitable and regular burden, and over time, they no longer see it as harsh. Under the foolish farmers' mistaken understanding that "soldiers and bandits are indistinguishable," they cleverly obtain safe protection, achieving their goal of survival. In October of this year, the suppression forces drove Xue Yonghui out of the West China Peninsula, turning him into a wandering vagrant living on boats on the shore of the lake, but according to recent confirmed information, Xue's troops have actually sneaked back into the Shanglangxiang village of the West China Peninsula and settled down. They have the ability to leave before the suppression troops arrive and then return after the suppression troops retreat! The reporter has questioned the cadres of the command headquarters about the formation of this situation. They all believe that if we can spread the power of propaganda and deepen the distinction between good and evil among the people, we believe that the bandits' skills in survival will inevitably lose their effect. Now, the Tai Lake Command Headquarters is preparing to start from this path. The reporter would like to appeal to Major General Mao Sen to give more instructions and assistance!

After listening to the work report, it was already past four o'clock.

Surrendered Troops Live in Bitter Cold

The rain fell harder and harder, and the sky became even gloomier. Major General Mao began inspecting the general conditions of the surrendered troops, which was the most important task of his special trip to Mudu. There were two provisional independent teams concentrated in Mudu, and another independent team was concentrated in Shanren Bridge for training. The first place we went was the barracks of Xu Jintang's battalion of the Third Independent Team. Thirty-one cadres, except for one left to serve as a guard, had all been ordered to gather in the barracks of the First Team to await instructions. What surprised the reporter was that in such cold weather, their bedding consisted only of two military blankets and a straw mat woven from rice straw, laid on the stone bricks of a large hall. Major General Mao was also saddened by this impression. He estimated the thickness of the military blankets with his fingers and repeatedly said that the equipment must be improved immediately. As for the soldier on guard duty, he had no uniform, only a short padded jacket and trousers, standing shivering in the west wind, reminding people of the arduous battles of our guerrilla forces during the War of Resistance! The barracks of the First Team were in a large rice threshing floor on Xiatang Street in Mudu. The low houses were close to collapsing, and the light was so dark that you couldn't see your fingers. There were 116 men in Liao Bingnan's unit, and they all had an old military uniform to wear, but it was also very thin. However, the 30 men under Xu Jintang, although they had no uniforms, wore padded robes and jackets that were quite neat and seemed warm. More than 140 stalwart men from the wilderness were lined up on the open field in the oblique wind and rain, each with a solemn face, overflowing with the joy of abandoning evil and embracing a new life! Major General Mao saw that the raindrops were falling harder and harder. He ordered Zhang Heqing, the instructor in charge of supervision and training, to change the route and gather the troops in the nearby Chenghuang Temple, while he first inspected the entire barracks. The so-called barracks were very pitiful, completely empty small rice warehouses with walls made of yellow mud and partitions made of reed mats. The soldiers' bedding did not even have straw mats, only two military blankets, one as a mattress and one as a quilt. The food was considered three meals, one congee and two rice, with 24 taels of rice and 250 yuan of non-staple food per person per day. When Major General Mao inspected the kitchen, he carefully observed the rice in the pot and the vegetables in the bucket, feeling that there was enough rice but too little vegetables.

Walking into the Chenghuang Temple, the dilapidated corridors still retained traces of the great fire of Mudu that year. The sky was already twilight. The stalwart men waited solemnly in the newly built main hall. Under the dim light of the flickering red candles, only a dark group could be seen, truly rich in the meaning of a gathering in an ancient temple! The reporter initially thought that Major General Mao would only give an earnest speech, but he didn't know that he would meticulously call out names and talk to each person according to the roster. The first to be called was Zeng Jilun, the deputy commander of the First Team (commander Liao Bingnan was on leave), a short, fat, and solid figure with a very fair complexion, with none of the coarse habits that we imagined he should have. He frankly stated the unanimous pain of his subordinates, which was that it was too cold at night, and he also hoped to increase the non-staple food allowance. He reported on the daily education and training schedule, which was to get up at 6:00 AM to carry out fitness exercises such as climbing mountains, running, and gymnastics. After breakfast at 9:00 AM, they would tidy up their internal affairs and go to the lecture hall. The afternoon courses focused on academic studies. The individual inquiries of the 134 stalwart men who actually attended the training took more than three hours. The reporter stood next to Mao, listening to the endless sound of eaves water dripping in the wide courtyard, his mood gradually becoming anxious. Leaving Suzhou in a hurry, without preparing rain gear, he would have to turn into a drowned chicken if he ran back to the command headquarters.

After the instructions were completed, fortunately, the sound of rain from the eaves had stopped. The rainy night in the countryside was particularly dark, almost to the extent that you couldn't see your fingers. Relying on the flickering flashlight, we stumbled back to the command headquarters, one foot high and one foot low. Thanks to Director Yang, a room was specially vacated for the reporter in the guesthouse, opposite Major General Mao's bedroom. After dinner, Major General Mao summoned the members of the disciplinary team for individual talks. This group of young partners, led by a female captain, Zhang Ximing, was the only direct force of the Tai Lake Command Headquarters. At about 11 o'clock, Deputy Commander Colonel Liu Hongde happened to return to Suzhou from Shanghai and rushed to Mudu that night after hearing the news. Colonel Liu, who is now fully responsible for the Tai Lake suppression campaign, is a stalwart and forthright young soldier. The reporter had a brief meeting with him, and he was busy going to see Chief of Staff Mao and did not talk much.

Tai Lake Remains the Same - Many Sailboats Come and Go

The night in the countryside was very peaceful. When I woke up in the morning, the rising sun reflected on the high walls, and the sky was already clear. The orderly said that Chief of Staff Mao had not rested until 5:00 AM and got up early to inspect the cleanliness of the toilets. The reporter couldn't help but admire his tireless and meticulous spirit. After washing up, his mind had flown to the vast Tai Lake. The reporter had been away from Tai Lake, which irrigates three provinces, for a long time. He wondered what the recent situation was like. Thinking that he would soon see it again and appreciate the endless scenery, he was very excited. Who knew that just after finishing breakfast, a long-distance call came from the Wuxi Command Post, reporting a major explosion at the Jiangwan Arsenal. General Tang Enbo ordered Mao Sen to rush to Shanghai to investigate. He had no choice but to cancel his plan to go deep into Tai Lake. However, although we did not go deep into Tai Lake, we still went to Xukou on the edge of Tai Lake to overlook the situation of Tai Lake, which can be regarded as "consoling ourselves rather than nothing"!

Tai Lake looks particularly quiet and beautiful in the morning sun. In the distance, several heavily loaded sailboats are sailing along the shoreline where the sky and water meet. The freight transport of Tai Lake has not disappeared after all. Limited by time, we could not stay for long. At 12:30 PM, the car took us back to Suzhou, and Chief of Staff Mao rushed to catch the "Qiantang" going downstream. A new task is being added to his shoulders. We shook hands tightly in farewell.

### Santa Claus

Our Newspaper Archives

The arrival of Christmas, even if no one tells you, you will know.

Walking onto the street, the first impression is that the shop windows on both sides are obviously different from usual.

Inside the long and short, large and small windows, almost all stand a Santa Claus. Although their faces are not exactly the same, they all have long beards, wear red clothes, have white cotton scattered on their bodies, and carry a large package on their backs.

What does Santa Claus carry? In the candy store, he carries cakes and chocolates; in the toy store, he carries small trains and small boats; in the shoe store, he carries a large bag of small leather shoes; in the hat store, he carries a large stack of red and green hats.

The origin of Santa Claus, it is said, began in the extremely cold area of ​​Northern Europe. The Teutonic people had a children's god named St. Nicholas. Later, it was spread to the United States and called Santa Claus. We Chinese call him Santa Claus. Legend has it that he is amiable and especially likes children. Every winter, he must prepare many gifts and personally give them to the children, especially paying attention to the poor children. Later, because the actions of the old man coincided with the spirit of Christ's love for others as himself, Christians adopted this story every Christmas, on the one hand, so that ordinary Christians could do some good deeds, and on the other hand, to encourage children to improve and learn the spirit of broad acceptance.

The task of this Santa Claus: is to carry such a large package, and in the early morning of Christmas, when everyone has not yet gotten up, quietly slip down from the chimney and stuff the gifts in the package into the socks hanging in front of the bed.

Speaking of the origin of chimneys and socks, it is also very interesting. It turns out that the British have long had a custom similar to our country's cleaning of dust at the end of the year. Before the New Year, they must clean the chimney so that good luck for the coming year can come in. I don't know how, but Santa Claus has changed to coming down from the chimney. Hanging socks was thought of by the British and Americans. At first, Dutch children put their shoes by the stove. It is said that Santa Claus must see the shoes placed there properly before putting the gifts in them. Presumably the British and American children are smarter and changed to using socks, because the socks can be stretched open and have a much larger capacity, so you can put more things in them.

### The First Voice of World Cultural Revival

— Our Special Correspondent Hong Fu

Paris, 7th (Airmail)

After the end of World War II, world culture suddenly encountered an opportunity for revival. A new movement is underway, and the trend is rapidly changing, as seen at the "First General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization." This conference was held from November to December 1946 and was created by a special meeting of representatives from 44 countries in November 1945. The rules of procedure for the General Conference were approved by the Executive Committee of the Organization at its meeting on August 19. Article 33 of the rules stipulates that printed materials are still in English and French, but the languages that can be used for legal resolutions are predetermined to be English, Russian, French, Chinese, and Spanish. The Chinese language occupying a superior position in the international arena is probably the first time ever.

The "United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization" is the key to preventing war and cultivating peace. If people today want to seek happiness for the future of the world, the difficulty of their undertaking is like building a huge mansion. The important institutions that the United Nations has already established, such as the Health Bureau, the Labor Bureau, the Finance Bureau, the Economic and Social Agricultural and Food Bureau, and the five combined, are like five major pillars, and the Scientific and Educational Association is the great foundation that bears everything.

The agenda of the Scientific and Educational Association is divided into six sections: (1) Education Section. (2) Creative Arts Section, which is in charge of sculptures, paintings, script writing, architecture, design, and other items. (3) Science Section. (4) Social Science Section, which is related to philosophy and the social well-being of humanitarians. (5) Museum Section, which is in charge of all museums that collect historical souvenirs, libraries that collect printed materials, and archives that collect anecdotes and documents. (6) Publicity Section, which is in charge of in-depth public undertakings such as movies, broadcasts, and news. The Chinese representatives to this conference are Zhao Yuanren, Li Shuhua, Cheng Tianfang, Chen Yuan, and Zhu Kezhen. On the second day of the opening, representatives from China and other seven countries were elected as vice-presidents of the conference. When the names were called, English, American, and Chinese were broadcasted together, which is another clear proof that China's international status has been particularly enhanced after the war.

### Tracing the Origins of Bloodlines: China and Siam are One Family

— Xu Songshi

Prior to the mid-13th century AD, when the Sukotai Dynasty was established, the Kingdom of Siam did not possess accurate national history. Therefore, most Siamese people are largely unaware of the origins of their ancestors.

Siamese Ancestors Were Originally Indigenous to China

In recent years, several Western scholars have affirmed that the ancestors of the entire Siamese nation came from China. Among these scholars, one of the most famous is Professor T. de Lacouperie of a British university. He stated that the ancient Siamese originated from the mountainous regions bordering Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces in China, and the Youchao clan was their tribe. One branch migrated westward, passing through the Jiulong Mountains bordering Shaanxi and Sichuan, then turning southward, traversing Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and reaching the Shan states and the Kingdom of Siam. Today, the Siamese people's preference for living in elevated wooden houses is a continuation of their nest-dwelling habits. French scholar E. Aymonier pointed to Yunnan and Kham as the origin of the Siamese race. British scholar F. Garnier stated that the Siamese race originated in South China.

The Largest Tribe, Known as the Big Tai and Little Tai

In recent years, the author has been deeply interested in the history of the Siamese nation. Based on personal research, it has been proven that the entire Siamese race are descendants of the broader Han Chinese race, and the Han Chinese originally originated in China, not from the West. As early as four thousand years ago, the ancestors of the Siamese lived south of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers in our country, belonging to the same tribe as the Jing and Shu of the early Zhou Dynasty, naturally a branch of the broader Han Chinese race. Later, the so-called Chu, Wu, Yue, Min, and Yue tribes were evidently of the same bloodline as the Siamese race.

The Siamese have always referred to themselves as the Little Tai people (Tai Nysi), while referring to the Lao people (Laos) in the north as the Big Tai people (Tai Noi). These two ethnic groups are the largest tribes in the Kingdom of Siam, with similar languages and customs. In addition, there are the Shan people, concentrated in the northwestern part of the Kingdom of Siam, also belonging to the Big Tai designation. In fact, the ancestors of the Shan people were the Wuhu people of Lingnan during the Zhou and Qin dynasties, who migrated earliest from Lingnan. As early as 500 BC, their vanguard had reached the Salween River basin. The ancestors of the Lao people were the Southwestern Yi people of Zhennan in Guizhou during the Western Han Dynasty, also known as the Zangke Liao (the words Liao and Lao have the same pronunciation). Meng Huo was their most famous chieftain. From the Shu Han to the Tang Dynasty, they migrated into Siamese territory in large numbers. During the Tang and Song dynasties, they were deeply dominated by the Nanzhao and Dali kingdoms. The Luohu Kingdom of the Yuan Dynasty was established by these Lao people.

The Siamese Kingdom of the Yuan Dynasty - Actually Descended from the Chimei

As for the Siamese Kingdom of the Yuan Dynasty, according to the "Continuation of the Comprehensive Examination of Documents," it was said to be descended from the Chimei (Red Eyebrows). The author has definitively proven that Chimei is a transliteration of Jingmei. Those who established this Siamese kingdom were the Siamese people, known as the Little Tai. During the Zhizheng period of the Yuan Dynasty, Siam and Luohu merged into one, which continues to this day. The name Siam originated from this. This Tai race is slightly different from the Lao and Shan races. This is because the ancestors of the Siamese race came directly from the northern part of Qinzhou in Guangdong and the southwestern part of Guangxi, namely the ancient Xiyuan, Guangyuan, and Huangdong, etc., starting in the Tang and Song dynasties. Moreover, we have many reasons to believe that those who initially held the reins of the Siamese kingdom were descendants of Nong Zhigao, the King of Dainan, who was defeated by Di Qing of the Song Dynasty. These Siamese people are the most intelligent and powerful part of the three major races in today's Kingdom of Siam: Siamese, Lao, and Shan. Their relationship with the Han Chinese can be described as even closer.

The Li and Tong People - Of the Same Bloodline as the Siamese

The Li people of Hainan Island in Guangdong today are undoubtedly of the same system as the Siamese. The Tong people (formerly written as Tong, pronounced as Zhuang) in the western and northern parts of Guangxi today are basically identical to the Siamese. The Gejia people of Guizhou and the Buyi people of Yunnan also belong to the same race as the Siamese. The author randomly selected 120 words from the Siamese language and compared them with the Tong language, and only thirteen were not very similar. In Ningming, Baise, Longzhou, and other places, Tong people with radios can listen to broadcasts from Bangkok, the capital of Siam, without any barrier. The names of Siamese villages, as well as living customs, etc., are almost identical to those of the more than four million Tong people in Guangxi province, which is a very interesting phenomenon. It should be known that the Tong people are an excellent ethnic group in the southwestern border region of our country. Famous generals such as Shi Dakai and Wei Changhui were all Tong people. Moreover, the so-called Baiyue people in ancient times were the Tong race. Currently, the Cantonese language still retains many phonetic elements of the Tong and Siamese languages. Calling water chestnuts "ma ti," pomelos "bok liu," and New Year's cake "da long gao" are completely Siamese and Tong words. The characters "Daliang" in Shunde, Guangdong, mean "Yellow Race Land" in Siamese. If we say that the ancient tribes of Jing, Man, Chu, Wu, Yue, Min, Yue, Li, and Tong are Han Chinese, then we absolutely cannot deny that the Siamese race are descendants of the ancient Han Chinese.

Monosyllabic Languages - Extremely Similar to Chinese

The Siamese people previously had a language but no script. At the end of the Yuan Dynasty, they began to use Indian Pali letters to spell out the Siamese language. Today, the Siamese language is still a monosyllabic language, with level, rising, departing, and entering tones. Many word sounds are the same as Chinese word sounds. Calling "two" "shuang," "eat" "geng," "heaven" "min," "wine" "lao," "die" "dai," and "house" "lan," these word sounds closely resemble ancient Chinese meanings. The Siamese language is so closely related to the Chinese language that we can only regard it as a dialect of the Chinese language. Undoubtedly, the Siamese compatriots are of our Han Chinese bloodline.

Recently, Siamese elder Nai Biri came to China for a visit. It was reported that the Siamese Ambassador Nai Shawan Dula Dao will soon present his credentials in Nanjing. We hope that these two "Nai" (the word "Nai" in Siamese is equivalent to the Chinese word "Jun" or "Mister") can truly recognize that China and Siam are one family, truly understand the history of China and Siam, and make more enthusiastic progress in the relationship between the two countries!

### Diplomacy: Then and Now

— Yun, from the New York Times

A Good Show Keeps Evolving / From Full-Scale Martial Arts / To Changing Styles Now

A good quarter of a century has passed, from the Versailles Peace Conference in 1919 to today's conference at Villa d'Este. Sitting in boxes drawn by cartoonists, we have witnessed the performance of international diplomacy. It is a continuous good show that constantly evolves: the diplomatic figures and their methods, the attire and the drama, the atmosphere of the stage, and the length of the plot - everything has changed.

Of course, some traditions have endured, such as the scolding and quarrels that have enlivened the conference hall since this war, which are indeed the unadulterated classical style of seeking peace. Whenever a war subsides, diplomats seem to regard banging stools and tables at home as a necessary means of negotiating peace with the enemy. In fact, sometimes they even go a little too far.

In the Palace of Versailles after World War I, British Prime Minister Lloyd George, with his anger rising to his head, felt he had to grab French Prime Minister Clemenceau's formal coat collar and demand an apology for the insults he had received. At the Lausanne Conference in 1922, Turkish representative Dr. Rıza Nur leaped across the green baize table and grabbed Greek Prime Minister Venizelos's throat, only releasing him when the Prime Minister's face turned blue.

As far as the world knows, no similar situations have occurred at conferences held in London, Paris, San Francisco, or New York since this war. The new style is no longer like that, replaced by verbal attacks, and physical beatings are no longer used.

Formal Dress is a Thing of the Past

Since the diplomatic figures themselves have undergone the aforementioned changes, the clothes they wear have naturally changed as well. Twenty-five years ago, when we stepped into the First Peace Conference hall, even as mere observers, we had to wear striped trousers, black morning dress, and a black Homburg hat, full of dignity. It seemed that everyone who had a hint of diplomatic flavor had to dress as neatly as the diplomats engaged in it. But today, this Edwardian-style coat has become a symbol of diplomatic antiques. Young politicians are ashamed to touch it again; they prefer to discuss world affairs in informal jackets and trousers. At the opening of the United Nations General Assembly in New York this time, there was a similar

The Diplomacy of 1919 was a Full-Scale Martial Art / Lloyd George's Liver Fire Rises, Grabbing Clemenceau's Collar / Feeling He Must Apologize for the Insults He Received.

The Diplomacy of 1946 is a Kissing Style / Bevin and Molotov No Longer Use Physical Beatings / But Replace Them with Verbal Attacks. Only one regulation of the old form remains: to wear a proper dark-colored coat, but it is no longer necessary to wear morning dress, and this requirement is still for the interpreters, not the representatives themselves.

There have also been changes in diplomatic language. In the entire 18th century and part of the 19th century, there was only one diplomatic language: French. Professional diplomats were required to conduct business in French. But at the Versailles Conference, two tycoons, Wilson and Lloyd George, knew nothing of French, while the French old man Clemenceau spoke English fluently. Whenever he was happy to do so, this Tiger Prime Minister would immediately jump over the barriers of diplomatic convention and use the rough side of his language to his colleagues, speaking in English that all three could immediately understand.

Diplomatic Language Changes

Today, putting a microphone on the conference table has brought about a tremendous change in diplomatic language. Sometimes what a representative says is the same as what he says to his own people; he says it that way and hopes that people in the conference hall can understand it. There is another reason for this: every representative believes that his national language is no less important than any other country's, and for the prestige of his country, he hopes to use his national language fluently. Although this requirement cannot be satisfied without limit, the United Nations today already has five official languages: Chinese, French, English, Spanish, and Russian. National prestige is won, and five hundred people waste time simultaneously.

Finally, there is one more change to mention, which is that today the diplomatic world still has an order of seniority in the driving of vehicles and the seating at banquets, but the actions of diplomats reflect the opposite of the importance they occupy. The higher the position, the harder the work. Only after each banquet, the order of leaving the table and returning to the studio is arranged according to the level of status: first the Foreign Minister, then the Ambassador, and then the Minister Plenipotentiary. Chargé d'affaires and assistants lazily follow back to the piles of documents and conference seats after watching all these people leave.

Diplomacy today has indeed become a more cumbersome job than before.

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Center of the World Situation Shifts to the Far East / White Development of Asia is a Thing of the Past

— Chu Yukun

Since the Four Foreign Ministers Conference and the United Nations General Assembly have successively closed, 1946 has finally achieved a peaceful ending; the efforts of politicians and diplomats from various countries throughout the year have not been in vain, and the achievements of these two international conferences are indeed rare successes in previous international conferences. Therefore, after returning to their respective countries, politicians and diplomats from various countries have successively made speeches, praising the significant achievements of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference and the United Nations General Assembly. Everyone places their hope for the future development of the world political situation in 1947. First, on February 20 next year, the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland can be signed in Paris, and these five vassals of Nazi Germany can also return to normal and become member states of the United Nations; second, on March 20 next year, the Four Foreign Ministers will hold another meeting in Moscow to discuss the peace treaties with Germany and Austria. The world is moving towards peace step by step, which is indeed optimistic, and it is believed that the future of the world will have unlimited hope.

The Situation Improves / What About the Far East?

Since the overall situation in the world has improved, it is not impossible for the great powers to cooperate and jointly create world peace, so the Far East situation also has the hope of becoming brighter with the improvement of the world situation. But the current Far East is indeed the worst part of the world. For example, although China is one of the five powers, the failure to resolve the KMT-CPC problem has resulted in the entire country being shrouded in the flames of civil war. In addition, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Burma are all brewing independence movements, and blood is shed there every day, especially in Vietnam, which almost puts the entire Republic of Vietnam in complete turmoil. Moreover, the French government authorities not only handle this improperly, but also have not abandoned their past approach to the colonies. Therefore, the Vietnam issue is even more difficult to resolve. Vietnam has appealed to the United States and China to come forward and mediate. If the French Socialist Party cabinet cannot make a clear decision, even if the United States and China mediate, it will be useless. We want to tell France that the era of white development of Asia has passed. As stated in the New York Minsheng Forum,

The United States Reaffirms Its China Policy

In the past six months, there have been places in the United States that have requested the government authorities to reconsider their China policy, and there have also been places in China that have misunderstood the United States' policy. Therefore, President Truman's reiteration of the China policy is very necessary. President Truman finally issued a lengthy speech on the 18th of this month, reiterating that the United States' China policy remains unchanged, and the China policy issued on December 15 of last year remains effective; and solemnly declared the following items.

(1) The US military is stationed in China at the request of the National Government to assist China in repatriating Japanese residents and prisoners of war, as well as restoring domestic peace and order in China. The number of US troops has been reduced from 113,000 to 12,000. (2) Recognize China as an autonomous and independent country, and recognize the National Government as the sole legal government of China; (3) The United States

### The World of Women

Does the world today belong to men? To this question, our answer is "no." Taking the United States, the most advanced country in the world, as an example, according to statistics from the country's Department of Commerce, women spend 85 percent of the hard-earned money of the country's salaried class. The Federal Census Bureau announces that the average life expectancy of American women is four years longer than that of men.

The nurse in charge of medical examinations at the State University Health Clinic in San Jose, California, made a record of students' reactions to various vaccinations and serum injections, proving that 45 percent more men than women have weak knees when seeing needles.

The US Public Health Service investigated the number of pneumonia cases. The report says that 55 percent of patients with the disease are men. Clerks at the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company revealed that more men than women have appendicitis surgery, and the American Medical Association also tells us that significantly more men than women develop hardening of the arteries.

The American Optical Company in Southbridge, Massachusetts, studied the prevalence of color blindness among Americans and found that 90 percent of color-blind people in the country are men.

A water safety officer in Los Angeles analyzed 2,800 lives saved on the beach over a decade and was surprised to learn that male swimmers accounted for 70 percent of all accidents.

A professor at Syracuse University estimates that 1 percent of Americans stutter, and men account for 75 percent of those who stutter.

Even the gods seem to trouble men, as a London insurance company employee specializing in accident statistics discovered that 87 percent of people killed by lightning strikes are also men.

### Trivia

— Wu Pengming

The US Department of Commerce recently reported an interesting fact: Infantrymen sent overseas during the war used two types of pills to prevent seasickness, one containing the active ingredient "Hainei Xing" and the other containing only white sugar as a psychological treatment. At sea with mild waves, 20 percent of those who took white sugar still got seasick, eight times more than those who took "Hainei Xing" and still got seasick. At sea with treacherous waves, the seasickness situation with these two types of pills was almost the same.

### The Wonder of Christmas: Why is it Mysterious?

— Translated by Yunbei from Kaufman's "Christmas in Maine"

Everyone Does the Same Thing at the Same Time

It is most appropriate to observe the characteristics of Western nations from the customs of Christmas. Because this is a holiday that includes three qualities: first, it has a strong religious meaning; second, it belongs to the joy of families and children; third, it is everyone's annual excuse for gluttony. Appropriate for this publication's issue coinciding with this year's Christmas, a section describing the holiday is selected and translated as follows;

"If you also want to have a happy Christmas, like the one I once spent in Paradise Meadow as a child,... you must have a clear December night, with the blue stars of Maine sparkling like sapphires, surrounding the moon that shines brightly on the earth. At this time, light up all the lights on the branches piled with fake snow, and they will sparkle like shattered diamonds... You can also fill this Meadow House with myrtle trees, hanging clusters of blue jewels on them,... or hang rose fruits on pine needles. Clusters of currant fruits are piled up, and gingerbread has also been placed in the appropriate place.

In addition, it is best to have an aunt beside you. She believes that herbal tea and the Bible are two things that must be prepared for children, so she opens the Bible and reads the story of Christ's birth aloud to the whole family. Of course, a Christmas tree is even more indispensable. This tree must be tall enough so that its branches can turn along the ceiling of the sitting room, presenting the shape of an old fan opening. You can wait until the morning of that day to bring it home on a sled.

Uncles and aunts are all at home, and there are even more cousins, truly a cartload. At this time, your whole nation is playing this and playing that at home. The element of the most fulfilling Christmas is that everyone is doing the same thing at the same time.

### The Real Mastermind Behind the Yunnan Uprising

— Lu Danlin

During the National Protection War, the Yunnan Uprising aimed to overthrow Yuan Shikai's betrayal of the country. However, for the past thirty-one years, a true assessment of its primary driving force has been lacking. Historical accounts have left the public in a state of confused uncertainty. Kang Youwei claimed, "I instructed Liang Qichao to carry out the Yunnan Uprising." Liang Qichao, however, stated, "I instructed Cai E to carry out the Yunnan Uprising!" Moreover, Liang Qichao's writings, such as "Bi Dun Ji" and "Gong Zhan Tan," extensively glorified his own achievements and those of the Progressive Party. Naturally, this was a political tactic and a maneuver by politicians. Nevertheless, some people were misled by them. Even middle and primary school textbooks primarily highlighted Cai E's achievements while dismissing the initiative of the Chinese Revolutionary Party (from the Tongmenghui to the Kuomintang). This is confusing right and wrong, inverting black and white. A clear clarification is needed in party history, National Protection War history, and modern history to provide a correct understanding for our study of the political history of the Republic of China.

The backbone of the Progressive Party was Liang Qichao, and both Liang Qichao and Kang Youwei were key figures in the Constitutionalist Party. Sun Yat-sen stated in Chapter 8 of Psychological Reconstruction of The Plans for National Reconstruction: "At that time, the Constitutionalist Party emerged, acting as accomplices for the tiger. Their opposition to revolution and the republic was even more severe than that of the Qing court." The irreconcilable relationship between Liang Qichao and the revolutionary party was a fact, and the Progressive Party pledged allegiance to Yuan Shikai while excluding the revolutionary party. In the early years of the Republic of China, this was also a prominent reality. When Yuan usurped power, Liang Qichao opposed the imperial system. Superficially, this was Liang's clever move, but the underlying truth involved political motives. However, since Liang opposed Yuan, the people of the country naturally held him in considerable admiration. Because the National Protection War against Yuan was not solely managed by the revolutionary party. But there must absolutely not be any covering up of the eyes and ears of the people of the world, seizing the credit of the world, and using it for personal or factional glorification.

Around the time of the Second Revolution, many Kuomintang members suffered from Yuan Shikai's expulsion, arrest, and killing. Aside from those who fled overseas or went underground to organize, some revolutionary comrades had different perspectives and took separate paths. Others took advantage of Yunnan's inconvenient transportation and Yuan's limited actual control. Tang Jiyao had his own ambitions and treated them well, either assigning them to civil positions, involving them in behind-the-scenes activities, employing them as instructors at the military academy, or providing them with military training. In southern Yunnan, the revolutionary spirit was exceptionally united in preparation for any eventuality. On April 8th of the Republic of China’s year, the Song An assassination occurred, further exposing Yuan Shikai's treacherous schemes. At that time, Sun Yat-sen resided in Tokyo, personally maintaining the work of the Chinese Revolutionary Party. Realizing that Yuan was betraying the Republic of China, he immediately initiated plans for uprisings in various regions, specifically dispatching Ju Zheng to Shandong, Zhu Zhixin back to Guangdong, Chen Qimei to Shanghai, Yu Youren to Shaanxi, and Lu Zhiyi back to Yunnan to engage in planning activities to overthrow Yuan. Ju and others followed orders and made arrangements accordingly. Lu returned to Yunnan from Japan and secretly organized. Upon arriving in Kunming, the provincial governor, Ren Kezheng, immediately received a telegram from the Beijing Headquarters, ordering Lu's detention in the police station. Lu sent messages to comrades Deng Taizhong and Yang Qin for assistance. Deng and Yang went to the police station and took Lu to see Tang Jiyao. Tang asked Lu to stay at Deng Taizhong's home, allowing him to interact with Fan Guofan, Li Zhisheng, Hong Xun, and others. He also secretly discussed with high-ranking generals such as Luo Peijin, Huang Yucheng, Zhang Kairu, and Ye Quan, and they decided on four measures: 1. If Tang Jiyao opposed the imperial system, he would still be promoted as the leader. 2. If Tang remained neutral, he would be respectfully sent out of the country. 3. If Tang supported the imperial system, he would be killed. 4. If the second or third options were implemented, Luo Peijin would be supported as the leader. Deng and Yang also took the opportunity to inquire about Tang's true attitude. Tang indicated that such a major decision required a majority vote. At that time, Yuan sent special envoys Jiang and He to Yunnan to inquire about Tang's opinion, secretly to monitor him. Tang then secretly instructed his brother, Jiji, to convene a secret meeting of officers above the rank of regimental commander. Initially, everyone was unwilling to express their opinions, but later a secret ballot method was used, and the result was unanimous opposition to the imperial system. Three things were decided on the spot: 1. Actively promote patriotism among subordinates. 2. Organize armaments and prepare for war. 3. Maintain strict secrecy. This was the first meeting, which took place on September 14th of the fourth year of the Republic. On October 17th, the second secret meeting decided on four matters: 1. If any of the central provinces could be expected to respond, an uprising would be launched immediately. 2. If any of the provinces of Guizhou, Guangxi, and Sichuan could be expected to respond, an uprising would also be launched. 3. An uprising would be launched if overseas Chinese or the party provided financial and material support. 4. If none of the above three opportunities proved effective, the province would make a last-ditch effort to declare independence for the sake of the nation's honor and integrity. On November 3rd, the third meeting decided on the war strategy for the uprising, with Luo Peijin appointed to draft it. After the major plans were decided, Tang cautiously observed the situation and employed strategies. On the one hand, he feigned compliance with Yuan and requested funds and weapons to replenish the troops. On the other hand, he secretly dispatched Jian Jiashou to Japan to purchase weapons, Liu Yunfeng to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, Wu Zhifu to Guangdong and Guangxi, Li Zhisheng to Sichuan, Li Huibin to Guizhou, Yang Xiuling to Hunan, and Lu Zhiyi to Nanyang to raise funds and contact the party headquarters. These separate actions were decided upon after Lu returned to Yunnan and discussed methods to overthrow Yuan with Tang and others.

The military plan was decided in several secret meetings during the planning of the anti-Yuan campaign, and the army was moved to the border of Sichuan under the guise of bandit suppression. During the troop deployment and departure, comrades from various parties, including Xiong Kewu, Cheng Qian, Dai Kan, Wang Boqun, Fang Shengtao, Li Zonghuang, Zhenpeng, and Yin Chengxian, arrived in Yunnan one after another. Li Liejun, Cai E, and others also telegraphed their arrival in Hong Kong by sea (although Liang Qichao had made an agreement, he did not arrive). Li and Cai were both Tang's local classmates and close friends. Tang dispatched a team led by Chu to meet them along the way and escort them separately to Kunming. When Tang and Cai met, Cai told the welcoming generals, "I am overjoyed. You have prepared everything in advance and have treated me with such courtesy." This shows that Yunnan had made prior preparations.

On December 23rd of the Republic of China's fourth year, a telegram was sent from Kunming requesting Yuan Shikai to abolish the imperial system, jointly signed by Tang Jiyao and Ren Kezheng. A telegram was issued and circulated to the whole country to request joint persuasion, signed by Tang Jiyao, Ren Kezheng, Cai E, Liu Xianshi, Li Liejun, and Dai Kan. Later, all telegrams to various parties were signed in the order of Tang, Li, Ren, Liu, and Dai. Undoubtedly, this proves that Tang was the leading figure, and not initiated by Liang or the Progressive Party. More than ten days after the uprising, Tang wrote to Liang Qichao: "Songpo (Cai E's courtesy name) and Xunruo (Dai Kan's courtesy name) arrived in Yunnan and conveyed your instructions, which was resolutely adopted." If we carefully interpret the four words "resolutely adopted," we know that the Yunnan anti-Yuan campaign was planned long ago, and it was not determined after Cai's arrival. Moreover, Cai's arrival in Yunnan was on December 19th. On the 21st, Tang convened a meeting, and on the 22nd night, Tang presided over the alliance and the participants swore an oath in blood. Seeing this, we know even more that there had been a long and meticulous arrangement beforehand. Otherwise, how could such a major event have been prepared in such a hurried three or four days?

Although Liang Qichao said that the Yunnan Uprising was directed by him and was the achievement of the Progressive Party, not planned by the revolutionary party, the facts speak louder than the cunning and opportunistic propaganda. The names of the senior officers of the National Protection Army are listed below, which shows that the organization and generals of the National Protection Army belonged to the Kuomintang in the largest number.

After looking at the above table of forty-five people, twenty-eight belonged to the Tongmenghui Kuomintang (in fact, the Tongmenghui had already been reorganized into the Kuomintang, and then reorganized into the Chinese Revolutionary Party. This is said according to their original party membership), two were non-party members, thirteen were unknown, and one belonged to the Progressive Party. Facts speak louder than sophistry. The National Protection War and the Yunnan Uprising were led by whom, who planned it, and to whom the credit should belong. The facts are obvious.

The reason why the general public misunderstood it as the initiative of the Progressive Party and Liang Qichao was because of Liang Qichao's article "Yi Zai So-Called Group Problem," which shook the whole world at that time. Second, Cai E was Liang Qichao's student. Third, Liang Qichao published articles and telegrams in Guangdong and Guangxi, and participated in the two anti-imperial institutions of the two Guangdong military headquarters and the Military Affairs Institute. By relying on the exaggeration of words, he was able to dazzle the sight and hearing of some people. This created a habitual record of wrong being right, and lightly erasing the generals who had planned in advance, made careful arrangements, and taken practical actions by the Chinese Revolutionary Party. This is a political means of reversing the facts, suppressing others and raising oneself. However, many people have been deceived by him, so we have to list the facts to correct them.

### Pang Zuoyu's Flowers

— Shi Chongpeng

I haven't seen Ms. Pang Zuoyu of Wuxing for a long time. She can sing the Qingyi style of Cheng Pai, she can write Wang-style calligraphy like the "Lanting Xu," she can paint, and even more so, she can write poetry. Whenever calligraphers and painters gather, they point out several female painters, but Ms. Pang's beautiful figure is nowhere to be seen. Once I asked about it, and I learned that she had left Shanghai for a trip to Qimen. In this way, I often think of her intentionally or unintentionally! Yesterday, I suddenly learned from the newspaper that she was holding a solo exhibition, so we reunited after a long absence.

Her demeanor is still as youthful, lively, and generous as in the past, and her works are indeed worth looking at with new eyes after being apart for three days. In her more than a hundred flower and bird paintings, I felt a pure and serene aesthetic, with neither the unconstrained appearance of the present day nor the arrogant and fierce aura, but a style of innocence, beauty, strength, and gracefulness that is thought-provoking. I believe that this type of style will surely win the appreciation and praise of the majority of people.

Ms. Pang is a prominent disciple of Yongjia Xiang Manqing. Manqing has been a professor for many years, and although he has many students, perhaps Pang Zuoyu is the only one who has truly mastered his teachings and even surpassed him? The flowers painted by Manqing that we have seen are mostly works that combine meticulous detail with freehand strokes, and are influenced by Qing Teng and Fu Tang. However, Zuoyu has a tendency to surpass Kunling and explore Jiannan (Zhao Chang), which is worthy of attention! For example, the six small album leaves in this exhibition are elegant and profound, and the spirit of Nantian overflows from the paper and ink. In particular, the colored "Chrysanthemum" is not inferior to the Nantian painting I saw at Qian'an's house ten days ago. In addition, a vertical axis of "Ink Orchid" has light ink and a dashing spirit, simply a reproduction of Qing Teng, which has the same wonderful beauty as the "Colored Chrysanthemum." I think Manqing can't help but sigh "I am ashamed of being inferior to you?" The inscription: "Light autumn clouds are most resistant to the cold, cold fragrance holds up the jade sandalwood, English service of immortal affairs, do not take a common late festival view". It is truly like this person and has this painting, this painting and has this poem.

In the fan albums and small pieces, autumn, lotus, maple leaves, morning glories, poppies, purple wisteria, camellias, winter plums, bamboo sparrows, azaleas, etc., are painted with light or heavy makeup, with both double-hooking and boneless techniques. Some take the law of Xu Huang; or the scale of Zhao Yi, (Xu Xi, Huang Quan, Zhao Chang, Yi Yuanji) These, twenty years ago, when the Shanghai School of painting was popular, some people may have issued the distorted criticism of "ancient dross?" In fact, taking the law from above, only in the hands, calligraphy and painting art, should be more refined, only its work, can be refined, only its essence, can be magical, can be refined and virtual inside, moving aesthetic. If you arbitrarily doodle, indulge in uninhibited, absurd and strange, is a wild fox Zen in the art garden, fine cloud black? God said black? Beauty Cloud Ming? We should take the way of the ancients, learn from nature, and then from the ancient people, the ancient method, seek its refinement, have the original source, warm the old and know the new, and then the spirit and the ancient meeting, the heart and the gods travel, to achieve the peak of the realm. Therefore, we appreciate Ms. Pang's flowers, and she is currently advancing rapidly on the stage of ancient people and ancient methods. I believe that her departure from the ideal "peak" is not too distant.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 132

— Ye Jingfeng

〇Eleven, however, valued his bloodline, bearing the Japanese name of Arrow River Kamihara. He was in his forties at this time, working as a freelance mechanic; he had invented a silencer for handguns. As long as you attached this silencer to the outside of any handgun, you could hardly hear the gunshot when it was fired. There were also twenty-round magazines, a puzzle lock, and so on. For any safe, he only needed a thin steel wire, one end held in his mouth, the other end connected to the safe's lock spring. He had a way to open the safe without much effort.

At this time, there were five people in the Ansaka chicken farm, including Tsurumi and Ansaka. While carefully reviewing the information brought by Boar about the son's movements in the afternoon, Tsurumi explained his plan for exploring the "Seven Sealed Letters" that evening to the four men.

His plan had four layers of action; scheduled to begin at 9:00 PM, 〇Twelve would lead his fighters to scout around the Konoe residence. When the actual action began, they would be responsible for leading, warning, hindering external support, and assisting in any fights that might occur due to internal mistakes.

The second layer would be led by 〇Eight, Boar, who would lead several capable comrades to attack the Konoe residence's garden, responsible for guarding, guiding, and any necessary fighting. The third layer would be carried out by Ueno, Arrow River, and Maruko; they would conduct the search; Maruko would lead the way, Arrow River would deal with any electrical difficulties, and Ueno would be in charge of photography; (In addition to a sophisticated light-up camera, he also had an infrared darkroom photographic apparatus. This was a treasure he had brought back from abroad. The device contained a small generator, and the entire apparatus was housed in a pair of seven-inch-long leather boxes, for emergency use in case the power lines were cut.)

Ansaka had the best memory and was extremely calm and careful; so he would serve as the overall commander for this operation, bearing half of the internal workload.

After Tsurumi explained the plan, the five men re-examined, discussed, and studied it again, correcting some imperfect steps. Everyone felt it was impeccable. Only then did Ansaka officially take office, assuming the responsibility of overall commander.

It was already past 3:00 PM. He received two internal intelligence reports relayed by 〇Twelve, indicating that everything was going well. Maruko had done nine-tenths of the internal work, and was only waiting for both positive and negative reactions, to report at any time. Just as everyone was about to split up to prepare the equipment and tools for their respective responsibilities, a special telephone call suddenly came in, specifically requesting to speak to Tsurumi!

To ordinary people, it might be a bit of a surprise: "Who could be calling?" However, in the minds of Tsurumi and his comrades, it was like a thunderbolt out of a clear sky, shocking them all into a daze.

To say that they were all stunned was no exaggeration. Logically speaking, people like Tsurumi and the "〇" numbered comrades were all physically and mentally sound, with stable nerves; in a country that ranked second in the world in terms of security and espionage organization, and within the area of reach, they had actually set up more than a dozen secret radio stations, which could be considered shrewd, capable, intelligent, and courageous. Moreover, each of them had probably experienced many risks. Why were they so shocked by a single phone call at this time?

This was due to another layer of connection. Because Tsurumi hiding at Ansaka's was not only considered extremely secret by himself, but even Ansaka, who was so careful and thoughtful, considered it very appropriate and thorough. Since it was hidden to such an extent, someone had actually discovered it and made a phone call. In other words, this one hundred percent secret had been leaked, hadn't it? In this case, not to mention Tsurumi, but anyone, would probably be shocked into a daze.

"Who is it?" Tsurumi picked up the telephone and asked.

"Hee!…" A very familiar voice laughed like this. "Who?… giggle… Besides me, no one in Tokyo knows your whereabouts… Brother, you can rest assured!"

"Hah!…" Tsurumi was indeed relieved, "Your abilities are truly admirable…"

"Brother!" Pingzi cut off Tsurumi's words, "You're mistaken in your admiration."

### Walking All Night

Ten years ago today, President Chiang escaped from Xi'an and flew back to Nanjing. At that time, the emotions displayed by people all over the country were truly ecstatic. Many people were so happy that they wept, and they spontaneously bought firecrackers and set them off everywhere. The emotions were overflowing, which was the expression of patriotism, concentrated on supporting the head of state.

Today, when we recall it, we can't help but feel infinitely excited.

It was precisely because of this scene that the enemy became even more fearful and accelerated the outbreak of the war of aggression.

A friend came to Shanghai, bringing several million dollars, which he spent in less than three days. Before leaving, he borrowed travel expenses from me. He said: This place is really a place to spend money. The glass windows of every store seem to be reaching out a hand to you. He didn't buy a single thing he had planned to buy, but he bought a lot of things he hadn't planned to buy. They were cheap, good, and beautiful, so you couldn't help but open your wallet. As a result, he had to empty his pockets, and his original plan had to be broken.

Tonight, the business hours of all dance halls are still as usual, until 12:00 midnight.

It is said that various dance halls had petitioned the authorities for special permission to operate all night, but this was not granted. The authorities enforce the law like a mountain, and this kind of spirit is worthy of our admiration!

Friends who love to play, sorry, please be disappointed for once!

If someone is prepared to bring money into the dance hall, and cannot dance all night, I would like to advise him to stroll around the road tonight. I am afraid there are many hungry and cold people on the road who need someone to send them a few banknotes!

All religious denominations under the name of Jesus Christ are bound to have a cross as a symbol, but someone familiar with religious sects will tell you: Just by looking at how the believers use the cross and what kind of rituals are held in front of the cross, you can generally know which system the church belongs to.

Some people think that the cross is a sacred symbol of Catholicism or Christianity. Although this statement is correct, it seems that the cross should be regarded as a symbol of Jesus' martyrdom and suffering for the sins of the body. We have seen these scenes in movies based on the "Bible": Jesus carried the cross himself and walked up to the Mount of Olives, and was immediately nailed to this cross. In addition, we have also seen many historical paintings from the Middle Ages depicting Jesus nailed to the cross, or carrying the wooden frame on his right shoulder and walking to the execution ground.

According to Chinese customs and habits, that scene is equivalent to a prisoner sentenced to death, being asked to carry a coffin to the execution ground himself, or, like the Japanese "Bushido" style, being forced to dig a pit first to be buried alive! What a tragic scene this is!

In the earliest religious paintings or religious buildings, the cross must have Jesus' entire body cast or sculpted on it. Later, it slowly became simplified, leaving only a cross.

The length of the horizontal and vertical lines of this frame also has a lot of attention. Initially, the length was proportional to the person's height and the length of the arms outstretched; later, it became an important "law" in art composition, the so-called "Golden Law." The law stipulates that for anything cross-shaped or rectangular, the most beautiful proportion of one long and one short must be:

Short: Long = Long: (Short + Long)

This law is still inherited by academic artists.

Some people say that the symbol of the Red Cross is also evolved from the Christian cross. In addition, a certain international movement that uses the "White Cross" and "Double Cross" as symbols comes from the "Red Cross."

Finally, the author would like to talk about the interesting phenomenon of "coincidence" between the East and the West: When Chinese illiterates sign a contract, in addition to putting fingerprints, they also hold a pen and write a "ten" character as a signature. In the West, there is also the same traditional old rule. This cross signature is called "Chrlst-cross" in English.

### X'mas

— Hui

Today is Christmas, and the author would like to say a few words appropriate to the occasion.

Everyone knows that this holiday is called "Christmas" by Westerners in writing, but it is generally abbreviated as "X'mas." In fact, the original word is not that long, only two syllables, so why must it be omitted, and the letter "X" is used instead? There is a reason for saying this.

In English, the letter "X" is not a "good letter." The meaning of "X" is often used to express "doubt," "unknown," "unknowable," etc. The origin of "X-ray" is that the nature of this radiation was not understood at the time. The scientific "X element" and "X body" are all like this.

To be precise, the "X" at the beginning of X'mas cannot be regarded as English, but Greek. According to the abbreviation of "Christ" in Greek, the first two letters "XP" are extracted, and further simplified, only the letter "X" remains. (According to Greek, the pronunciation of "X" is slightly like "ch" in English, and "P" is equivalent to "ˇ") The origin of English X'mas is also here.

The Chinese translation of it as "聖誕節 (Christmas)" (Holy Birth Festival) is not very accurate either. First, "誕 (Birth)" and "節 (Festival)" are a bit redundant; second, "基督 (Christ)" is an abbreviation of "基利斯督 (Christos)" in the original text and is not equal to the word "聖 (Holy)."

If I must translate a new one, then I think that translating it as "基督誕 (Christ Birth)" is enough. "耶穌誕 (Jesus Birth)" seems to be slightly inferior.

Overseas Chinese often call "December 25th" "Western Winter Solstice," because the winter solstice is around December 22nd of the new calendar every year.

"Winter Solstice is Greater Than the Year." This is an old saying passed down in our family, and it's the reason we must have a big dinner every year on this day. The Winter Solstice mentioned here is the Chinese Winter Solstice. As for the "Foreign Winter Solstice," that was a new program after entering high school.

Strangely enough, since there's been a "Foreign Winter Solstice," the original Chinese Winter Solstice has been completely overshadowed. Every Chinese Winter Solstice passes unnoticed, while every "Foreign Winter Solstice" is a day of revelry.

The first person to call Christmas the "Foreign Winter Solstice" must have been extremely clever. The term is filled with exotic charm and fully caters to the tastes of the Chinese people. As a result, people are unwilling to let this day pass by lightly.

Gentlemen prepare for dances, ladies prepare new outfits, restaurants prepare Christmas feasts, theaters prepare special films, and Christmas cards and gifts are passed around among the crowds. Turkey, chocolate, big cakes... fragrant and sweet. Santa Claus brings love, happiness, and laughter.

And the Chinese Winter Solstice? In my memory, there's only hot pot, grandmother's homemade rose wine, and her never-ending stories after a hint of intoxication. Later, grandmother passed away, and no one in our family remembered that day as the Winter Solstice, although I still remembered the old saying "Winter Solstice is Greater Than the Year."

The war ten years ago drove us to Hong Kong. Hong Kong is a foreign land, and the winter's joys were monopolized by "Christmas." The entire Victoria City was decorated like Santa Claus's villa. All the Caucasians were drinking heavily, shouting, singing, laughing, and staying up all night on this day. The Chinese were largely divided into two types: the lower class followed them to watch the fun on the streets, and the gentlemen congratulated each other with "Merry Christmas" in the Hong Kong Hotel restaurants.

That night, the dance halls were packed and open all night. Cars were constantly on the roads. The police closed their eyes and leaned against the telephone poles, like Santa Claus taking a nap.

The Pacific War drove me from Hong Kong to Guilin. The "Christmas" I saw belonged to the American Air Force and the ladies from Hong Kong. Zhongnan Road and Zhongbei Road were a small-scale Queen's Road: wine, cakes, firecrackers, canned turkey, the Lequn Society, Lido, and the Central Restaurant were filled with allied soldiers in grass-green uniforms and enchantingly dressed women. The Winter Solstice is foreign joy, it is international. The characteristic of this joy is cheapness and universality.

The Xianggui War forced me to Chongqing. Chongqing also had "Christmas." In auction houses, at movie theater entrances, in shop windows displaying large cakes, there were traces of Santa Claus everywhere. The Sino-French-Belgian-Swiss Cultural Association resounded with music in places that weren't dance floors. Refugees heard the bells, orphans received gifts, and lovers became couples on this day.

### Regarding Gifts

— You Juan

Today is Christmas, let me tell a realistic story to some hospital owners. This can also be considered a gift:

In the evening, I took the No. 2 tram home from the Bund. The windows were closed, perhaps because it was too stuffy due to the crowd. Suddenly, a young man who looked like a student fainted. Coincidentally, there was a foreign doctor in the car. He immediately opened his bag, took out a syringe and medicine, and quickly gave the fainted young man an injection. The young man gradually woke up. He was very grateful to the foreign doctor. At this time, a Chinese person standing next to the doctor said:

"It's really embarrassing to have you foreigners spend money and effort on Chinese affairs. May I ask how much the service fee is? Let me do the honors!"

The doctor replied:

"I don't need money. I am willing to give him the injection. Moreover, my intention is not to ask for money. A doctor's duty is to serve the broad masses of people, regardless of nationality or wealth. Anyone who doesn't have a spirit of universal love is not worthy of being a doctor!"

He refused the other person's money.

### After Much Calling, It Finally Appears, Only to Turn Around and Go to the Black Market

— Wen Hu

After the distribution office announced in the newspaper that the retail store would open on the 21st, it was a pleasant surprise. The long-awaited "Blanket Girl," loved by everyone, also "stepped forward" in the retail store that day and officially met with public education personnel. However, her value has increased by half compared to the past. Fortunately, it hasn't "tripled," otherwise public education personnel wouldn't be able to afford it, and they wouldn't be able to "have a close encounter."

Having raised 45,000 yuan and with twelve million points of joy, enduring the severe cold with the impending heavy snow, during my lunch break on the 21st after work, I ran to the first retail store on Fuzhou Road, thinking that this time I would definitely meet the soft woolen blanket I had been longing for. Who knew that when I ran to the distribution office, what I saw was not the soft blanket, but a notice pasted on the glass door: "All 800 Woolen Blankets Have Been Sold Today." A basin of cold water was poured over my head, and I was disappointed. Pushing the door open, I saw countless angry faces, complaining unhappily.

After searching for a while and asking many people, I finally found the place to "request" the distribution registration form, but the distribution certificate could not be "requested." It required an official letter from the organization, but the newspaper did not stipulate this. Finally, relying on "persuasion," they "accommodatingly" "bestowed" a distribution registration form. I don't know why they had to make things so difficult!

Unable to buy a blanket, I naturally shifted my target to the 4,300 yuan bed sheets, but I was rejected again, saying "the goods haven't arrived yet."

Bringing a belly full of complaints, I returned from the distribution office and walked into the cage-like office. Sitting at my desk, I thought carefully and couldn't help but become suspicious.

"All 800 blankets have been sold." Were they sold out so "rapidly" in one morning? And they made it so difficult to "request" the registration form.

Let's assume that sales started at 8:00 in the morning, and I arrived at the distribution office (12:00). That's four hours. Selling 800 blankets in four hours means that the procedure for selling one blanket takes only "18 seconds." May I ask, can the procedures of counting 45,000 yuan in banknotes, verifying the number and seal of the purchase ticket, and the accounting of the recipient be completed within this short time?

From this factual inference, we can draw the following conclusions:

(1) Each person is not limited to purchasing one blanket.

(2) Perhaps not all 800 blankets were sold. Did someone buy them in bulk and have them flow into the black market?

(3) Why are only a few hundred blankets sold each day, instead of selling as many as possible? Is this to facilitate ××, or is there another purpose?

### Precious Bible

— Mai Tang

Christians all regard the "Bible" as the most precious book. In terms of the number of copies printed, the Bible has been printed or written more than any other book in the past 1,900 years.

Precisely because so many copies are printed, errors in proofreading are inevitable. And these error-filled Bibles are treasures for Western book collectors.

One version is called the "Vinegar Bible," which is the 1717 "Oxford Edition" because the word "Vineyard" was mistakenly printed as "Vinegar." Each copy of this version is worth hundreds of gold pounds or more.

Another version is called the "Wicked Bible," a European edition, because the negative word in the "Ten Commandments," "Thou shalt not commit adultery," was omitted!
