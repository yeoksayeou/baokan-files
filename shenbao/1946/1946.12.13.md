[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The National Assembly Presidium held its 16th meeting at 10:00 AM on the 12th, chaired by Zhang Qun, and resolved: (1) Each review committee will continue its work on the 12th and 13th, concluding on the evening of the 13th. (2) The convenor of the Comprehensive Committee will hold a meeting on the 13th. (3) The Comprehensive Committee will hold meetings at 3:00 PM on the 14th.

(5) Sun Ke, Chen Bai-ti, Wang Shijie, Xu Chuanlin, Chen Qitian, Xi Yushu, Kong Geng, He Hong, and eight other representatives were selected as convenors of the Comprehensive Committee.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Regarding the issue of the term of office for this session of the National Assembly representatives, it is rumored that an agreement has been reached that, under the principle of "mission accomplished but term not expired," it will be explicitly stipulated that "after the National Assembly concludes, the National Assembly representatives will be responsible for promoting political affairs, and their term of office will last until the closing day of the next National Assembly."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Zuo Shunsheng answered questions related to the National Assembly at a reception held by the Central Propaganda Department on the 12th, as follows: Question: What are the views of the Youth Party on the draft constitution? Answer: The draft constitution proposed by the government was formed through consultation. Although the Youth Party's views are not included in the draft constitution, the Youth Party supports this draft constitution. Question: It is rumored that the Youth Party will participate in the reorganization of the government. Is this true? Answer: The principle of government reorganization has been determined, but the facts have not yet been concretized. If they are concretized, we will also consider whether to participate. Question: Article 1 of the draft constitution has been revised. What is your opinion? Answer: The passage of this article deviates from the original agreement. The Youth Party, of course, does not oppose the Three Principles of the People. The Youth Party will support the original proposal and does not agree to further revisions. It is not that every party cannot revise, but that certain important parties cannot revise. Question: Jiang Yuntian, the spokesperson for the Democratic Socialist Party, expressed his opinion on the draft constitution yesterday. What is your opinion? Answer: It is very good that the Democratic Socialist Party has adopted a reserved attitude and will express its opinions during the General Assembly. As for the original text of Jiang's speech, I have not yet seen it. Question: If the National Assembly passes the constitution, but the Youth Party does not agree, what will the Youth Party do? Answer: I believe that a draft constitution cannot satisfy every party on every article, so small disagreements are fine. Question: What are the Youth Party's thoughts on the rumored negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party? Answer: The Youth Party has always hoped for peace. It is always good to talk. If both parties need the Youth Party to participate, then the Youth Party will be happy to participate. Question: Why is Li Huang of the Youth Party not participating in the National Assembly? Answer: Li Huang's participation in the National Assembly was proposed at the same time as the list of other representatives of the Youth Party. At that time, Mr. Li did not express that he would not participate. Mr. Li has been elected as one of the members of the Presidium. The reason why Mr. Li is not coming now is due to his personal health issues, which have nothing to do with politics. Question: What are your opinions on ethnic issues and the opinions of the Mongolian compatriots who requested the implementation of a high degree of autonomy and the preservation of the league and banner system? Answer: I personally feel that the draft constitution originally stipulated that all ethnic groups are equal and that local autonomy is within the scope of autonomy, which I sympathize with very much. Regarding the league and banner system, I have learned that the government has no intention of changing it. As for a high degree of autonomy, I am not yet clear about its nature. Question: Luo Longji of the Democratic League gave a speech at Jinling University, saying that the draft constitution submitted by the government to the National Assembly is inconsistent with the Political Consultative Conference. What is your opinion? Answer: I have not yet seen the full text of the speech. The draft constitution must be revised, so of course there will be differences. There will still be differences when it is discussed and passed in the future. However, the Political Consultative Conference is not the final draft either. Its most important principle is that it is hoped that it will not be changed. Question: The prerequisite for the Communist Party to resume peace talks is to dissolve the National Assembly. What is your opinion? Answer: I have no opinion. Question: What is the Youth Party's opinion on the issue of the capital? Answer: We advocate that the location does not need to be specified. Question: Are there any points in the draft constitution that cannot be changed under any circumstances? Answer: (1) The powers of the National Assembly cannot be changed too much. (2) The Executive Yuan's responsibility to the Legislative Yuan cannot be modified. Question: What confidence do you have that the important principles in the draft constitution will be passed in the General Assembly? Answer: We are currently exchanging opinions with all parties. I believe that there will be no changes to the important principles.

### The First Review Committee Solemnly Discusses the Rights and Obligations of the People. The Article on the Personal Freedom of the People is Amended and Passed.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The chapter on "The Rights and Obligations of the People," which is most closely related to the people, was solemnly discussed at the First Review Committee of the draft constitution on the 12th, both in the morning and afternoon. Representatives from the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and other parties spoke very enthusiastically, carefully scrutinizing every word of the relevant rights and obligations. Article 8 of the original proposal, "Citizens of the Republic of China shall be equal before the law regardless of gender, religion, race, or party affiliation," was passed without objection. However, Article 9, which concerns the personal freedom of the people, was given special attention by all parties. Zhang Zhiben, Qin Liankui, Mou Zhendong, Ji etc., were recommended to revise it first. Later, in the meeting, there was a debate about whether the police agency has the power to detain and interrogate. Finally, the original proposal was amended as follows:

"The freedom of the people's person shall be guaranteed. Except for the arrest of criminals caught in the act, which shall be determined separately by law, no one may be arrested or detained by judicial or police agencies without due process of law. No one may be interrogated or punished by a court without due process of law. Any arrest, detention, interrogation, or punishment that does not follow due process of law may be refused.

When a person is arrested or detained on suspicion of a crime, the arresting or detaining agency shall notify the person and their designated friend of the reasons for the arrest or detention in writing, and transfer the person to the appropriate court for interrogation within 24 hours. The person or others may also request the official court to bring the arresting or detaining agency for trial within 24 hours. The court shall not refuse the aforementioned request and shall not first order the arresting or detaining agency to reply. The arresting or detaining agency shall not refuse or delay the court's order for trial.

When the people suffer any illegal arrest or detention, they or others may petition the court for investigation. The court shall not refuse and shall investigate the arresting or detaining agency within 24 hours and handle the matter in accordance with the law." Articles 10 to 20 were all maintained in their original form. Although some people advocated adding the phrase "shall not be restricted without law" to Articles 11 to 15, they were still passed in their original form. There was a slight debate about the freedom of religious belief, but it was still maintained in its original form. The only amendment was to Article 21. The original text of that article was "The people have the duty to serve in the military in accordance with the law." Now, the three characters "and labor service" have been added after military service. However, according to some representatives, this case is of great importance to the people, and someone may still raise objections in the General Assembly.

### The Second Review Committee Holds a Full-Day Meeting with No Results

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The Second Review Committee of the draft constitution held a plenary meeting all day on the 12th to discuss the revised opinions after sorting. The morning session was chaired by Wang Puhan. There was a fierce debate on whether ethnic minorities should separately elect National Assembly representatives. Finally, it was decided to submit this issue with a record to the Comprehensive Review Committee for resolution. The afternoon session was chaired by Hui Ji Kuan. Representatives enthusiastically spoke on the revised opinions of Article 27. One part advocated expanding the National Assembly's right to elect and recall to include the heads of the five branches of government, while another part advocated maintaining the original proposal, so that the state’s important power should be attributed to the National Assembly, and secondary and regular powers should be attributed to the Legislative Yuan for remediation, and the National Assembly cannot be permanently established. Various arguments were made, but however, to the 26th person who spoke, it was already six o'clock, and the crowd dispersed, and the all-day meeting had no results.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The Second Review Committee continued to meet at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 12th to review Article 27 of the draft constitution. When the provisions of the powers of the National Assembly were reviewed, Chen Qitian, a representative of the Youth Party, solemnly declared that yesterday afternoon, the Second Review Committee passed an article adding the National Assembly as the highest agency for the exercise of political power on behalf of the people within the National Assembly. The reason why the Youth Party did not speak at that time was to wait for the review of Article 27 to see how it would affect it, and then decide its attitude. Regarding the expansion of the National Assembly's powers, if it is based on the article added yesterday and greatly expands its powers, then the Youth Party will reserve the right to speak on this issue in the future General Assembly. He also said that the Youth Party believes that the following two items can be added to the powers of the National Assembly: (1) Changes in territory must be decided by the National Assembly. The National Assembly has the right to amend the constitution.

### Democratic Socialist Party Raises Objections to the Powers of the National Assembly The Youth Party Declares that it Reserves All Due Rights

[Our Newspaper Report] Sun Yi, a speaker of the Democratic Socialist Party, said on the evening of the 12th: Regarding the issue of the powers of the National Assembly, the attitude of the Democratic Socialist Party is extremely firm. Since the Preparatory Meeting of the National Assembly has decided that the National Assembly is the supreme agency of political power, it is very possible that the Democratic Socialist Party will withdraw from the National Assembly. Because the review opinions will be given considerable attention when the National Assembly reopens the plenary session.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Zhou Yisan, a representative of the Youth Party, announced at the First Review Committee on the afternoon of the 12th: "This delegate is ordered by the Youth Party delegation to make a simple statement, please record it. All those who make fundamental changes to the draft constitution proposed by the National Government and who have not been agreed to by the representatives of the Youth Party. The representatives of the Youth Party reserve all due rights."

### The First Review Committee Heatedly Debates and the Proposal to Establish the Capital in Beiping is Passed. It Will Be Submitted to the Comprehensive Committee for Discussion Again.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The dispute between establishing the capital in the north or south occurred in the First Review Committee of the draft constitution yesterday, after the preliminary battle. Today, the main forces contacted, and finally caused a big storm, which disturbed for nearly half an hour. Finally, it was submitted to a vote. Of the 192 people present, 117 people supported establishing the capital in Beiping, which exceeded half the number. Only 63 people supported establishing the capital in Nanjing. However, Liu Baimin, a representative from Nanjing, proposed that according to the decision of the Presidium, when the Review Committee encounters cases of unresolved disputes, they should be submitted to the Comprehensive Committee; please ask the Chairman to send this case to the Comprehensive Committee. According to Huang Shaogu, the convener, speaking to reporters afterwards, according to the decision of the Presidium, the results of the Review Committee's review, which are contrary to the original principles, should be sent to the Comprehensive Committee. Therefore, the case will still be discussed in the Comprehensive Committee. It is still uncertain whether the capital will be established in Beiping or the original proposal to maintain Nanjing as the capital.

This morning's First Review Committee was chaired by Xia Erkang of the Youth Party. Zhang Shan, a representative from Henan, explained his proposal to establish Lanzhou as the central capital, Nanjing as the eastern capital, and Shule as the western capital. Then, Song Dongdai, a representative from Shandong, under the enthusiastic applause of the northern representatives, spoke freely about the reasons for establishing the capital in Beiping. His words were: "Without the north, there is no China." To build a modern China, the capital must be established in Beiping. Establishing the capital in Nanjing is dangerous for the country. This kind of dream can be awakened"!

The Nanjing representatives were not willing to be outdone. Du Xinru spoke, expressing his admiration for the opinions of the northern representatives, and then returned to the topic. The safety of the country depends more on political facilities and national defense plans than on the capital. Even from the point of view of appeasing the hearts of the people, it is not necessarily necessary to establish the capital in Beiping.

At this point, Li He, a representative from Hebei, who had caused the storm, stood up to speak. Li first declared, "Brothers are young and vigorous, and there may be offenses." Those who were watching knew that a heated debate would be unavoidable. After Li explained that this matter was not a "north-south dispute," he refuted Liu Baimin's statement yesterday that "Nanjing is the revolutionary capital, the war of resistance capital, and the victory capital." He claimed that Premier Sun Yat-sen's revolution began in Guangzhou, so the real revolutionary capital should be Guangzhou. The war of resistance capital was not Nanjing, but Chongqing. Nanjing enjoyed the fruits of the revolution, and retreated first in the war of resistance, causing the traitor Wang Jingwei to establish a puppet capital in Nanjing. Therefore, he advocated establishing Nanjing as the "capital of national humiliation." As soon as this statement came out, the northern representatives applauded greatly, while the Nanjing representatives, because they were insulted too much, first Wang Yisheng stood up and pointed out. Nanjing, if it were the "capital of national humiliation", then why should the Chairman return the capital to Nanjing? Expressing strong dissatisfaction with its insulting capital, Jin Jiafei and others also questioned it. The local representatives did not wait for the speech to finish, and immediately stood up to confront each other. At the same time, more than 20 people spoke. The scene was noisy and chaotic, which was rare since the opening of the First Review Committee. Some representatives even stood on the high table of the council, dancing and gesticulating, with cups and paper flying. They insisted that Wang Yisheng must be severely punished. Although the conveners Huang Shaogu and Chen Yiyun shouted "Please maintain order" and bowed to all sides, asking the representatives to sit down, order was still difficult to maintain. After two or three minutes, the representatives settled down a little, and Chairman Xia Erkang suddenly announced "Please representatives who have not been allowed by the chairman to speak without authorization leave the meeting," and the situation became chaotic again. The Nanjing representatives asked according to what withdrawal order the representatives were to withdraw, and expressed that the entire body would leave, while the northern representatives firmly requested the chairman to carry out the decision he announced. After a stalemate, a "recess" sound came from the chairman's platform. Female representative Zhang Xiulan had a dispute with the chairman over a trivial matter, resulting in a quarrel. The bell, the sound of discussion, and the sounds of all sides were mixed together, and the order was extremely chaotic. One or two soldiers also watched at the door, so as to maintain order when necessary. Li He had stood up to speak at 10 o'clock. By this time, the clock was pointing to 10:20. The chaos had lasted for more than 20 minutes. The chairman then took emergency measures and asked the reporters present and people not related to the meeting to leave the meeting, and then submitted it to a vote. First, the proposals to establish the capital in Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Wuhan were voted on, and they all only received seven or eight votes. The reporters laughed in the next room. The vote on establishing the capital in Beiping was held. The sound of pulling chairs and leather shoes came from the meeting place, and everyone knew that those who stood up to support it must be in the minority. Then, I heard Liu Baimin, with his Zhejiang accent, urging the chairman to pay attention. Since there were opposing opinions on the case, please submit it to the Comprehensive Committee for review in accordance with the decision of the Presidium. After the voting ended, the reporters suddenly entered the room, and it was only then that they learned that those who supported establishing the capital in Beiping accounted for the majority (192 people were present, and 117 supported it). Only 63 votes supported establishing the capital in Nanjing, and only 67 votes supported not stipulating it in the constitution. The northern representatives were very satisfied, while Jiang Zhengqing and other representatives from Nanjing solemnly declared their right to speak at the General Assembly at the chairman's platform. Vocational representative He Yuanming had submitted a note to the chairman at 9:30, asking him to suspend the review and submit the case to the Comprehensive Committee. The chairman failed to pay attention, which caused a great disturbance. He especially questioned the chairman and expressed his deep regret. At 10:45, they continued to discuss Chapter 2. The Nanjing representatives left in turn, and the meeting place was very quiet after the great storm. Only some representatives discussed the issue of "personal freedom" in a slow and methodical tone. Although this matter is of great importance to the people, it no longer attracted general attention.

### The Executive Yuan is Responsible to the Legislative Yuan. The Third Review Committee Submits it to a Group for Sorting.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The Third Review Committee was held at 9:00 AM this morning, chaired by Jiang Yuntian, to continue discussing Article 58, the article on the Executive Yuan's responsibility to the Legislative Yuan. Liu Guanzun, Shi Shangkuan, Du Guangxiang, Chen Changheng and others expressed their opinions separately, and Wang Shijie explained the process of amendments made from the May 5th Constitution Draft through the Political Consultative Conference and the most recent ones. The representatives had many opinions. The Chairman sought everyone's opinion. After a five-minute break, Wang Chong'e, Wang Shijie. Li Junlong, Sun Yafu, Zhang Weihan, etc., put forward their opinions, believing that a sorting group could be formed to sort it out first, and then submit the sorting opinions to the General Assembly for discussion, which would be simpler and easier to implement. After passing it, they proceeded to vote for seven people as sorters. The meeting will continue in the afternoon, and the sorting group is scheduled to be held at 4:00.

### Cases of Legislative Yuan's Reconsideration

The meeting was still chaired by Jiang Yuntian. First, Bao Ming reported that Liu Yuxun, Sun Yafu, Zhou Shuzhi, Chen Changheng, Li Junlong, Cheng Ximeng, and Wang Minxiang were elected as members of the sorting group, and they immediately gathered in the West Wing on the second floor with conveners Pan Gongzhan and Shi Shangkuan to discuss the various opinions on Article 58 and sort them out. The plenary session continued to review the following cases. Article 59 was changed to "The Executive Yuan meeting shall be organized by the President, Vice President, heads of various ministries and commissions, and ministers without portfolio of the Executive Yuan, with the President as the chairman. (The original text does not have this item) The President of the Executive Yuan and the heads of various ministries and commissions shall submit the bills, budget bills, martial law orders, declarations of war (originally amnesty bills), peace negotiation bills, treaty bills, and other important matters, or matters involving the common interests of ministries and commissions, to the Executive Yuan meeting for deliberation."

Article 60. Article 61 was originally passed. Article 62 was reserved and will be discussed again when the Second Review Committee holds a joint review committee meeting. Article 63. Article 64 was passed in its original form. The provisions of Article 65 on the distribution of seats for legislators aroused fierce debate again. The discussion was stopped halfway through.

The amended draft of Article 58, which was drafted by the sorting group for two hours, added "The Executive Yuan shall report to the Legislative Yuan on its administrative policies and plans" and amended the cases of reconsideration by the Legislative Yuan. Two-thirds of the legislators present are two-thirds of all legislators to determine the number of people. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM and decided to submit various opinions on Article 65 to the conveners for sorting and presentation at the meeting on the 13th.

### The Government's Dispatch of Personnel to Yan'an Has Not Yet Been Specifically Decided. We Are Determined to Abide by the Treaty on the Dalian Issue.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The Central Propaganda Department's press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters was held at 2:00 PM on the 12th, hosted by Minister Peng Xuepei and Director Ye Gongchao. The main Q&A is recorded as follows:

Question: Does the government have any plans to reopen peace talks? For this purpose, what measures does the government have now? Who will represent the government to Yan'an, Zhang Qun or Deng Lizhi?

Minister Peng replied: The government intends to send someone to Yan'an, but there are no specific decisions at present.

Question: The CCP has clearly stated, "Dissolving the National Assembly and restoring the military position on January 13" as the basis for resuming negotiations. Now the government declares its intention to resume peace talks and will send senior officials to Yan'an for negotiations. Does the government intend to consider these points, or does the government have another basis for negotiations?

Minister Peng replied: The two points raised by the CCP have been considered impossible by various Chinese and foreign newspapers, so I don't need to add any more comments. As for the other points, no decision has been made yet.

Question: Are there any large-scale battles in the Northeast? Or will they happen soon? Or have they happened elsewhere? In the conflicts in the Yan'an border area, what actions did each side take against the other?

Minister Peng replied: There are no large-scale battles in the Northeast or any other places. It is reported that the CCP is preparing for a so-called winter offensive in the Northeast and has concentrated a large number of troops with poor equipment and training in the northeast and northwest of Changchun, but there is no action at present. The Yan'an border area is still peaceful except for occasional small conflicts. The government has warned the CCP not to attack Yulin, so as not to extend to Yan'an. There is nothing happening at present. The CCP's propaganda that the government abandoned the border area of Baotou is also not true, because the troops stationed in those areas have been stationed there for a long time.

Question: Have China and the Soviet Union negotiated on the issue of receiving Dalian?

Director Ye replied: Regarding the issue of Dalian, the Chinese government has not conducted negotiations with the Soviet side. In our opinion, the status of Dalian has been clearly stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Treaty, and there is no need for any coordination. The Chinese government is determined to strictly abide by and implement the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty.

Question: What is the truth about the so-called Sino-Soviet Andong Agreement?

Director Ye replied: The Chinese authorities in Andong have been ordered to pay attention so that the Soviet military outposts on the Korean border will no longer extend into our national borders. This matter is being negotiated with the local Soviet military.

### Song Yishan's Assault on Reporter Case Reporters from National Assembly in Nanjing Send Letter to Hong Lanyou Inquiring About Handling of This Incident

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Dozens of reporters from Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, and Hankou sent a telegram to Hong Lanyou on behalf of Dai Weiguang, a reporter from the Heping Daily, who was beaten by Song Yishan, a representative from Hunan Province to the National Assembly.

At that time, a dispute arose over the seating arrangement, and Song Yishan, who was a representative of the constitutional assembly, infringed on the personal freedom of others and beat Dai Weiguang, a reporter from the Heping Daily, in the solemn National Assembly Hall. The colleagues are all extremely concerned about this unfortunate incident and how your meeting will deal with it. If you think that news reporters can be insulted at will, then the colleagues will not be willing to remain silent. This telegram is specially sent to you, and I hope to be taught."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Zuo Shunsheng answered the reporter's questions at a press conference. (1) Regarding a simple question between the representative of the National Assembly and the reporter, asked, what is your opinion on the humiliation of the reporter of the Heping Daily by the representative of the National Assembly? Answer. I don't know the process of this matter yet, but if there is anything moving, it is naturally not good, but you can write a letter to the Chairman and explain the process of this matter, and I can consider this matter, but I am not clear about its process now.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 12th] Since refusing to participate in the National Assembly, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been implementing general mobilization in full swing, hoping to launch a long-term rebellion. In the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, a General Mobilization Committee has been established, with Liu Jingfan as the chairman. At the same time, a mobilization order has been issued, requiring all men aged 15 to 45 to be organized into self-defense forces or core squads; women to be organized into transport teams or comfort teams; children to be organized into propaganda teams; and the old, weak, and disabled to be concentrated by a deadline for separate disposal. The vacant houses left behind are to be prepared for demolition when necessary, and food and utensils are to be strictly managed. All roads, large and small, are to be dug with concealed tunnels and landmines laid. The aim is to make every person a soldier, every village a camp, and every road a battlefield, resorting to the most extreme measures.

[United Press, Yan'an, 9th] (Delayed) Mao Zedong stated tonight at the CCP headquarters to United Press reporters and two British reporters that the CCP intends to use force to reclaim "lost territories" when necessary, including Zhangjiakou, Chengde, and northern Jiangsu, among other places.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 12th] Military News: After the government issued the third ceasefire order on November 13th, the communist forces, taking advantage of the National Army's compliance with the ceasefire, launched large-scale offensives against National Army troops in various regions. In Shandong Province, they captured Pingdu, Changyi, Shouguang, Qidong, and other places. In Shanxi Province, they captured Xi County, Yonghe, Daning, and other counties, as well as Fenxi, Huairen, and countless villages and towns.

The conference decided to step up the conscription of young men, organize stretcher-bearer teams and youth women's comfort teams, and mobilize 60,000 laborers to dig trenches in the Lianshu area in an attempt to hold firm. The 4th Division of the Shandong Communist Army, with over 20,000 troops, is currently rampaging in the Chaohou mountainous area of Zichuan, and is attacking the Zichuan mining area in conjunction with the 7th Division north of the Jiaoji Railway.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th] Military News: Communist forces in eastern Hebei launched an offensive on the 10th from Shangcang Township, fifty li from Ji County, and captured Baodi County town at 4:00 AM on the 11th. Shangguan Yunxiang, Deputy Commander of the 11th War Area, led troops from Tangshan to the rescue.

Sun Lianzhong Discusses the Current Situation: Communist Forces are Not Enough to Threaten Baoding

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th] Sun Lianzhong, Commander of the 11th War Area, met with reporters this morning and spoke freely about the current situation in the war zone, stating that the main task at present is to restore and protect transportation. Stability in the north is a matter of time, but it cannot be rushed. The recent tense situation in Hebei Province is due to the communist forces losing Rehe and Chahar. Hebei Province has grain and money, and the communist forces are attempting to use this to grow stronger. Under these circumstances, sporadic railway destruction is inevitable. The National Army cannot post guards every three steps or five steps. Although communist forces have been continuously reinforcing the periphery of Baoding in recent days, they are not enough to threaten the security of Baoding. The Ping-Bao railway will be open to traffic again in one week, while the Bao-Shi railway cannot be repaired in two or three weeks due to a lack of railway materials. Sun also stated that there are currently three battlefields in Hebei Province: one in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, one in eastern Hebei, and one in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway. For the convenience of command, the headquarters of the 11th War Area has divided Hebei Province into two major command zones, with the northern section of the Jinpu Railway and eastern Hebei under the command of Deputy Commander Shangguan Yunxiang, and the Pinggu Line and the northern section of the Pinghan Line under the command of Chen Lancheng. Sun himself will travel back and forth between Ping and Bao from now on.

### The Entire Jiaoji Railway is Repaired and Opened to Traffic; Rail Joining Ceremony Held Yesterday in Caijiazhuang; Northeast Changtao Railway Destroyed by Communist Forces for Over 100 Li

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 12th] The Jiaoji Railway repair project is progressing rapidly. A rail joining ceremony was held at Caijiazhuang at noon on the 12th. The Qingdao-Weixian section will officially open to traffic on the 16th, and a direct train between Jinan and Qingdao will begin running on January 6th. The railway had been interrupted for one year and forty days.

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 12th] The Ping-Bao Railway is being repaired simultaneously.

It is expected that the north and south rails will be joined at Xushui around the 15th.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 12th] After the main force of the communist forces on the Changtao Railway retreated to Dabentun (148 kilometers north of Nong'an), they completely destroyed 134 kilometers of railway between Chaigang and Dabentun, destroying eight bridges of various sizes, burning over 10,000 sleepers, and blowing up all station buildings along the line.

[Central News Agency, Zhiyang, 12th] Zhang Hongda, Deputy Director of the Shenyang Railway Bureau, told reporters today that the entire Anshan-Shenyang Railway will officially open to traffic on the 25th of this month. The Anshan-Shenyang Railway runs from Sujiatun, south of Shenyang, to Andong, a total of approximately 260 kilometers. It traverses numerous mountain peaks and crisscrossing rivers, making it the most arduous engineering project among all the railways in the Northeast. Several sections of the railway were thoroughly destroyed by communist forces in the past, and landmines were planted everywhere.

### The Huayuankou Blocking Bureau Sabotage Case

Confirmed to be the Work of Communist Forces

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 12th] On the night of the 9th, the stone quarrying site of the Huayuankou Blocking Bureau at Luwangfen, north of Xinxiang, was sabotaged by armed rioters. A preliminary investigation has confirmed that it was the work of the 49th Regiment of the communist forces.

### Differences Between China and the Philippines Have Been Eliminated; Friendship Treaty Will Be Signed; Overseas Chinese in the Philippines Can Establish Their Own Marketplaces

[Central News Agency, Manila, 12th] Chen Zhiping, our Minister to the Philippines, who returned here on the evening of the 9th, held talks with Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Quirino on amending the draft Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty for an hour. Well-informed sources say that all differences between China and the Philippines on the treaty have been eliminated, and the treaty can be signed soon. Chen also discussed the hawker problem with Quirino. Chen believes that our overseas Chinese have been trading as hawkers here for a hundred years and have made great contributions to the commercial marketplace. It is unfair for the Philippines to deprive them of their livelihood now. Quirino replied that according to the regulations promulgated in accordance with Article 37 of the Philippine Republic Act, Chinese hawkers are not allowed to operate in public markets, but they may be allowed to set up their own marketplaces. This allays the concerns of the overseas Chinese community here that the Philippine government will not allow them to set up their own marketplaces. Chen invited personnel from the overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce responsible for hawker affairs to a meeting at our consulate at 10:00 AM today.

### Ding Mocun Tried for the Second Time; The Court Continues to Investigate Evidence of Crimes; The "Devil King" Knows His Deceitful Plans Are Difficult to Sell

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Ding Mocun, the "Seventy-Six" murderous devil, was tried again at the Capital High Court on the 12th.

The scene in court today was far from what it used to be, with less than 200 spectators. Ding's cunning and treachery were far less than in the previous trial. When answering questions, he often looked back at his defense lawyers Wang Long and Xue Songqi. When mentioning the case of Miss Zheng Pingru's murder, he was not as animated as he had been in the previous trial. The court's investigation and interrogation of the evidence were extremely thorough and rigorous, and he knew that his deceitful plans could no longer be sold.

The morning session adjourned at 12:00 PM for rest, and the afternoon session continued at 2:15 PM until 4:10 PM, when it ended. The court ordered a postponement for a retrial, and Ding was returned to detention in the cold wind.

### The New York Foreign Ministers' Conference Concludes Successfully

The New York Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference concluded successfully yesterday. Not only did it complete its scheduled task of passing the draft treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland that had been approved by the Paris Peace Conference, and decided to sign them in Paris on February 10th next year, but it also made a further resolution: the next Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference is scheduled to be held in Moscow on March 10th next year to discuss the draft treaties with Germany and Austria. This must be said to be a major achievement of this Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference.

Throughout the year 1946, the politicians and diplomats of various countries convened countless international conferences to clean up the aftermath of the war and create world peace. Starting with the first session of the United Nations General Assembly in London in January of this year, two Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conferences were successively held in Paris, which enabled the Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference to open in Paris. Afterwards, the second session of the United Nations General Assembly was held in New York, and the Four Foreign Ministers also conveniently met in New York. During this period, politicians and diplomats from various countries worked tirelessly, traveling between London, Paris, and New York. The only aspiration in their hearts was how to lay a solid foundation for world peace. Therefore, in each international conference, they did not hesitate to use any words and tried their best to state their opinions. Although waves were caused repeatedly, the conscience of mankind's love for peace after the war finally overcame all obstacles and negotiated a compromise on the most thorny international problems it faced, so that 1946 could still achieve a peaceful ending. Therefore, we cannot but express considerable satisfaction with the successful conclusion of the New York Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, and recognize it as the most powerful guarantee for the successful creation of world peace.

Since the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference discussed the draft treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland and reached an agreement, the international community has been filled with an optimistic atmosphere, unfolding a beautiful prospect. The French political circles first expressed satisfaction, and the Soviet political commentator Zhukov published an article in "Pravda," emphasizing the achievements of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference and saying in an optimistic tone: "From the success of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, we can see that the cooperation of the four powers is still possible." This sentence really contains a very profound meaning and is worthy of our deep thought. Because since the end of World War II, the international situation has been changing rapidly, sometimes "at the end of the mountains and rivers," thinking there is no way to go; but sometimes, it is "the willow is dark, the flowers are bright," feeling that the future is bright and there is much to be done. Such uncertainty really makes people who love peace feel annoyed, especially China, which hopes for international peace, is closely watching the evolution of the international situation at all times and day and night is looking forward to the international situation being able to clear up as soon as possible. The rising and falling waves of success often make us uneasy; but now the conscience of mankind has finally broken through the international clouds. In the United Nations General Assembly's discussion of the two major problems of investigating troops and reducing armaments, the opinions of various countries were originally divided and their views were different, no less than running in opposite directions; but after the compromise and compromise of politicians and diplomats of various countries, the opinions of China, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union finally converged and established nine principles. Also, when the Four Foreign Ministers were discussing the most thorny issue of the Port of Trieste, the conflicts of interest of various countries seemed to have no room for compromise; but in the end, an agreement was reached. The representatives of the great powers all embraced the spirit of mutual trust and mutual concession, "nothing cannot be discussed, no problem cannot be solved," which really makes us have infinite hope for the future of world peace.

According to the analysis of the British Liberal Daily Manchester Guardian, the recent improvement in the international situation is due to a major shift in Soviet policy; the newspaper also called on politicians and diplomats of Western countries to use this rare opportunity to make good use of their wisdom and seek thorough cooperation with the Soviet Union. The editorial of this newspaper has repeatedly hoped that the post-war world will not be divided into two worlds, otherwise there will be no peace to speak of. The international progress in the past two weeks is really the starting point of a turning point in the era. The endless undercurrents in the international community for a year can be eliminated from now on. According to the Soviet Pravda, the increase in the production of some Soviet industries is still below the level of the government's budget plan, from which we can also know the difficult situation of the Soviet economy. Politicians and diplomats of Western countries should broaden their horizons, focus on the big picture, and ensure that the Soviet Union is enlightened and firmly believes that if the Soviet Union can cooperate with Western countries, it will be more beneficial than confronting them. Only in this way can the beautiful prospects before us be realized.

Finally, there is one more point that we have to point out, that is, our country naturally also deeply approves of the next Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference being held in Moscow to discuss the draft treaties with Germany and Austria; however, according to the Potsdam Declaration, China is also a member of the Foreign Ministers' Conference and should have the right to request to participate in the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference and jointly discuss the treaty with Germany. The four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union have no reason to refuse; however, after US Secretary of State Byrnes put forward the request of our Foreign Minister Wang, it was opposed by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, which we cannot but express regret about. At the same time, we also want to say a word to the four powers: if the current harmony among the great powers cannot expand its foundation, then even though the prospects before us are extremely beautiful, we are still afraid that it will be difficult to realize. Therefore, at this moment, we still cannot be too optimistic!

### Professor Pound Discusses the Chinese Constitution

[American Boston News] Professor Pound of Harvard University, a world authority on law, recently published a lengthy essay of over 20,000 words. He discussed in detail the basic principles that China should pay attention to in its future constitution-making process. He used historical and comparative methods, as well as the perspectives of Sociological jurisprudence and Pragmatic philosophy, which has attracted considerable attention from Americans. A summary of its main points is as follows:

(1) China needs a Chinese constitution with Chinese characteristics that conforms to Chinese national conditions, without copying foreign ones.

The most important point to pay attention to when formulating a constitution is to ensure that the content of the constitution matches a country's historical and cultural background and social environment. Constitutional politics is not something that can be created in a short period of time based solely on ideals. A constitutional government must gradually form and develop from a country's original cultural relics system and traditional ideals. It is by no means something that can be arbitrarily moved from one country to another after it is completed. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the creator of the Republic of China, saw this, so he advocated giving the Chinese people a transitional period in order to make considerable preparations for the implementation of constitutional government. The draft constitution announced in 1936 (Editor's note: the May 5th Draft Constitution) was drafted based on this plan. The draft constitution was drafted for the Chinese people based on China's historical and cultural background and social conditions, not for the people of Western Europe or the Americas, or for the residents of a utopian ideal.

Before and after the French Revolution, the constitution was repeatedly changed, and a new constitution was revised again in 1946. France adopted three constitutions in the ten years of the late 18th century, six constitutions in the 19th century, and today, before half of the 20th century has passed, it has adopted another new constitution. In total, France has adopted ten constitutions in 157 years.

The situation in the United States is the opposite. The United States has never changed its constitution since the establishment of the federal government. During the Civil War, the constitution was only amended three times, but the general organization of the government was not affected. As the great British politician and thinker Bryce said:

"Anything that makes people obey and respect must have a deeper foundation in the past: the slower the emergence and development of a system, the longer its life is likely to be; the American Constitution is no exception."

The situation after the American Revolution is quite similar to the situation in China today after eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. At that time, the American economy suffered serious damage, as is the case in China today. When the United States formulated its constitution, it preserved the inherent system as much as possible, so its constitution was able to adapt to the national conditions. When France formulated its constitution that year, it was overly influenced by the abstract ideas popular in the 17th and 18th centuries, and failed to consider its own historical background and social conditions. Therefore, although it repeatedly changed its constitution, the political situation could not be stabilized. China's constitution-making today should not simply copy the systems of Western countries.

The value of a constitution cannot be judged solely by the provisions on paper. Today, there are some countries that are merely democracies on paper. Several republics in Central and South America and several new countries in southeastern Europe are clear examples. The way these countries make constitutions is not a good example. In these countries, the general public does not actually know or have the opportunity to learn how to politically exercise the right to participate in politics granted to them by the constitution.

Some people believe that by carefully studying the constitutions of European and American countries in the past and present, an ideal constitution that can be universally applied to all countries in the world can be discovered. The error of this view is actually equivalent to the superstition that an ideal civil and criminal code that can be universally applied to all countries in the world can be formulated. Human experience is actually the opposite.

The formulation of a constitution must take into account the needs of time, region, and people. What China needs is a constitution with Chinese characteristics that suits Chinese conditions, not a constitution copied from foreign countries. The draft constitution of 1936 paid attention to this point and was more manageable. British scholar Bryce said: "What matters is the facts, not the names." No one can understand the Chinese environment as truly as the Chinese themselves. Only the Chinese themselves can use their talents to formulate a lasting constitution for China. I have observed many people serving the public in China today. My observations are enough to make me trust their ability, sincerity, and wisdom. Therefore, I dare to say to them in a frank tone: "You should trust yourselves, and you should promote the current task based on your own insights and understanding."

(2) The separation of powers is not a necessary condition for democracy or constitutional politics.

The separation of powers was originally a theory created by the Greek scholar Aristotle. At that time, there was no factual basis, because there was no so-called separation of powers in Greece at that time.

Although Britain gradually separated powers in the 17th century, it did not reach the extent described by the French jurist Montesquieu. In fact, all power in Britain is concentrated in Parliament, which is far from the separation of powers. The United States has encountered various difficulties in implementing the separation of powers, because politics and law are practical matters and the political power of a country cannot be divided entirely by logic.

The separation of powers is not a necessary condition for constitutional or democratic politics. The general public believes that this system is an ideal system that can be universally applied to all countries in the world, which inevitably ignores the special historical and social background from which this system originated. No one can argue that the separation of powers is the only system that guarantees freedom, is suitable for constitutional politics, or meets democratic ideals.

Democracy has nominal democracy and substantive democracy. There are many examples of nominal democracy in the world. We should strive for the realization of substantive democracy, and not stick to the name. There are different forms of democracy, so the distribution of power cannot be generalized.

Monarchy has autocracy and constitutionalism, and democracy also has autocracy and constitutionalism. In countries where the people's level of knowledge is low and political training is insufficient, the opinions of the majority are not necessarily desirable, and the public may not be enthusiastic about state affairs. As a result, the democratic politics of the majority is nothing more than the autocratic politics of a few bureaucrats and politicians. Moreover, the provisions of the constitution can restrict officials, but not necessarily the entire or majority of people in a country where sovereignty lies. If the people's education level is insufficient, the purpose expected by the constitution may not be realized.

Modern countries have transformed from power states aimed at exercising ruling power to "service states" aimed at serving the people. The scope of administrative activities is gradually expanding, and its importance is also increasing, so administrative power should not be excessively restricted.

What China urgently needs in administration today is unity, continuity, stability, and improved effectiveness. Since China lacks the historical and social background of the United States in those years, there is no need to adopt the three-power system, and the three-power system may not be suitable for China's urgent political needs today.

(3) Should China adopt a responsible cabinet system, a presidential system, or other systems?

Constitutional discussants often believe that modern countries must adopt either a responsible cabinet system or a presidential system. In fact, the government organization of democratic countries does not necessarily have to imitate either of the two. The most dynamic democratic countries in the nineteenth century were Britain and the United States, and their systems should be adopted by most other countries. Although the responsible cabinet system of Britain is widely popular, its performance in other countries is not satisfactory. The advantages of this system depend on the opinions of ten people: (1) It can enable the people's will to quickly and fully take effect; (2) It can enable the majority of the administrative department and the legislative body to cooperate and exert the effectiveness of the government; (3) It can concentrate responsibility. And its disadvantages are: (A) It is easy to make the radical spirit of the party play to the extreme and make the party concept dominate everything at all times; (B) The cabinet pays too much attention to how to cater to the fantasies of the public at that time in order to win its support, and it is too neglectful of the true needs of the state; (C) Because the failure of the cabinet in Congress on specific events continuously forces the personnel needed by the government to leave administrative positions; (D) The concentration of power in Congress and the need to quickly decide and implement important decisions make those in charge unable to think deeply. As Bryce said in his famous book "Modern Democratic Government", "Its mistakes cannot be remedied."

Moreover, those who advocate the advantages of the cabinet system often assume that the people's will is easy to grasp and that the people's will is fixed at a specific time. This may be the case in countries with a small territory, pure culture, uniform education, well-informed news, and tight organization. However, in China in the near future, this assumption may be difficult to become a reality.

The presidential system of the United States is popular in several republics in South America. This system originated after the American Revolution, and its purpose is to maintain the security and order of the country. Its advantages are: (1) The country's policies can be implemented without being interrupted by the sudden failure of the cabinet, making the administration more continuous; (2) The president and the cabinet do not have to be distracted by opposing speeches and no-confidence votes, and can focus on work; (3) Legislative work is less dominated by the concept of party struggle, because the handling of various events may not involve the comparison of strength between parties; (4) Because the political forces of all parties can only be adjusted during the stipulated period, politics is more stable.

The importance of the advantages of the presidential system has been repeatedly proven by American history. When President Lincoln lost control of Congress due to the congressional election of 1862, he was still able to continue to engage in the Civil War. This would have been impossible under the responsible cabinet system. It would have been unimaginable if the administrative department had suddenly been reorganized in 1863.

The presidential system has been quite successful in the United States, but it has not been effective in other countries. Its inability to be arbitrarily transplanted is the same as the responsible cabinet system of Britain.

In addition to the above two systems, there are also the direct democracy system of ancient times and some states in Switzerland, the administrative committee system of the Swiss Confederation, and the tiered parliamentary system of Russia. The former two are not suitable for the Chinese environment, and there is no need to say more; as for the Russian system, it has developed from Russia's special historical and cultural background, and its advantages and disadvantages are difficult to judge.

The drafters of the Chinese constitution, in view of the differences in the Chinese situation, did not stick to any system and selectively adopted some parts of each system to suit the national conditions, which is commendable.

(4) China should adopt a unitary system, and the division of powers between the central and local governments should be broadly defined, not listed in detail.

In terms of the history of various countries, although it is not appropriate for countries with vast territories to concentrate power in the central government, countries with many foreign enemies, even if their territories are vast, cannot but adopt a unitary system. The federal system is mostly a product of history, and it is not enough to strengthen national defense and resist the invasion of strong neighbors. When a country has the possibility of foreign enemies, it would rather sacrifice the federal system and establish a strong central government.

The United States, Canada, British Australia colonies, and the Republic of South Africa have never had serious foreign enemies, and there is no need to establish a strong national defense system. It seems that there is nothing wrong with adopting a federal system. China's situation is different today. The constitution-makers should take into account the needs of national defense, so a unitary system is more desirable.

As for the distribution of powers between the central and local governments, the principle of maintaining balance should be the main purpose, that is, the powers related to the general nature of the whole country should be strictly under the central government, and those that are more closely related to the local area or have local characteristics should belong to the local area. However, the boundaries between the two should not be strictly defined. The two cannot be absolutely divided at any time. There is no universal standard for what is national and what is local. What was considered local in the past is now considered national. (The following text turns to the third edition)

### Over Two Hundred Million Yuan Fraud Case in Wuxing: Large Silk Shop Collapses After Using Tempting Bait to Collect Money; Most Creditors are Victims of High-Interest Loans

[Our Wuxing News] Since the victory, the currency has depreciated, and prices have risen daily. Financial balance has been lost, and the economy is in a desperate situation. The lives of ordinary people are greatly threatened, and the hearts of the people in society are becoming more and more dangerous and fraudulent. Fraud, theft, and other things often happen. Now, Zhenkang Silk Shop on Xinzhuang Street in this city has branches in Shanghai, Suzhou, and other places. It is large in scale and wide in scope. The Huzhou branch is responsible for the entry and exit of funds from the China Communications and Second Banks, with Chai Zongyu as the person in charge, and Wang Zhongfu is responsible for other business entries and exits. Zhang Jichen is the manager of the Shanghai branch, and Xu Songsheng is the manager of the Suzhou branch. In addition to silk and crepe, they also engage in foreign exchange (high-interest loans are most prevalent in Wuxing, with interest of at least ten yuan per hundred yuan every ten days, but it must be deducted in advance when borrowing), issue bad checks, and hire employees to discount heavily with stores that have dealings with this city and Shanghai and Suzhou. At first, they settled on time, so they did not lose their credibility. Merchants and civilians who are greedy for profit are happy to deal with them. Unexpectedly, as of December 6, the Shanghai, Suzhou, and Huzhou branches closed down at the same time, and the responsible managers were all hidden and could not be seen. The affected creditors were panicked. According to the reporter's investigation, the total amount of defrauded money reached as much as 243 million yuan. Chunyuan Medical Garden on Dong Street in this city also guaranteed a loan of 10 million yuan from Zhenkang Silk Shop to the Huzhou China Bank, and was also affected. Because it could not afford to compensate, it has asked lawyer Wang De to declare liquidation. If the foreign exchange trend spreads, the entire commercial future of Wuxing will be unimaginable.

### This Year's New Recruits Will Be Sent Home After June If They Are Not Transferred; Explanation from the Commander of the Suzhou Regiment Management District

[Our Suzhou News on the 12th] The Suzhou Regiment Management District Headquarters yesterday received an order from Chairman Chiang, stating that in order to strengthen combat power during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the term of service of soldiers in the camps of various units was specially extended. Now that the victory has ended and the army is being built, the Military Service Law has also been revised and promulgated. Matters such as enlistment and retirement should be handled in accordance with the regulations. All active army infantry soldiers who have served for more than two years, and infantry sergeants and special soldiers and special soldiers who have served for more than three years, should retire early during the subsequent reorganization. Although active-duty and eligible young men are being recruited into the camp for service, soldiers recruited into the camp after October 10 this year should follow the provisions of the Military Service Law, serve in a timely manner, and retire on schedule, so that the military service system is brought into line with the right track, etc. After receiving the order, Commander Du Xu, a colonel, met with reporters from this newspaper on the 12th to explain the time limit stipulated in the new Military Service Law, saying that the new Military Service Law stipulates that the term of service for supplementary soldiers is only six months, and they can retire after the expiration of the term. However, if there are vacancies in the National Defense Forces, the supplementary soldiers must be transferred to regular soldiers, with a term of service of two years, and they can also retire according to law after the expiration of the term. Therefore, the new recruits recruited this year, if not transferred, can all be sent home after June.

### Li Hanxin, a Traitor, Sentenced to Six Years

[Our Suzhou News on the 12th] Li Hanxin, the leader of the special agent team of the enemy's Yangzhong Military Police, relied on the enemy's power to extort and blackmail when he was in office, doing everything he could. After the victory, he was sent by the Yangzhong County Government to the Suzhou High Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution.

### Hangzhou Municipal Assembly to Hold General Meeting on the 16th

[Our Hangzhou News on the 12th] The Hangzhou Municipal Assembly will hold its third general meeting on the 16th. It has received 37 proposals, and the focus of discussion will be the municipal government's policy plan and budget for the 36th year.

Therefore, he proposed that citizens work hard to create property in order to seek long-term development, and hope to complete land valuation within one year to consolidate the foundation of municipal finance. As for the trial implementation of the police management district system in the three districts, the qualifications and skills of police officers still need to be improved, and it is hoped that the standards will be strictly checked.

### A Large Number of Teachers and Staff in Changshu Petition Collectively for Back Pay

### Shanghai County Chamber of Commerce Appeals for Reduction of Profit Tax

[Our Minhang News] Regarding the profit tax issue in Shanghai County, the Songjiang Branch of the Direct Taxation Bureau insisted on stipulating a tax amount of 120 million yuan as the target for payment. Merchants and civilians throughout the county, due to sluggish business, cannot afford it, and appealed for a reduction to 100 million yuan to alleviate the difficulties of merchants, but the bureau did not approve it. Yesterday, Chairman Zhu of the County Chamber of Commerce invited all directors and supervisors, Secretary Zhang of the County Government, and Li Hengqi of the Local Association to discuss the matter. They all believed that the area of this county is less than one-third of that of Fengxian, and the number of shops is only one-sixth of that of Fengxian, while the profit tax of that county is stipulated to be 70 million yuan. Under the same jurisdiction, it seems unfair to estimate the huge tax amount in this county. Chairman Zhu of the County Chamber of Commerce, Chairman Lin of the Minhang Town Chamber of Commerce, and District Chief Wang of the First District were publicly elected to go to Songjiang to petition, appealing to the Taxation Bureau to consider the actual difficulties of the local area and approve the reduction. If the Taxation Bureau disregards the suffering of merchants and civilians throughout the county and does not grant their request, Chairman Zhu and others will go to the province to petition and present their difficulties in person, asking for correction.

[Our Nantong Dispatch] Xu Mojia, Commissioner of the Fourth District, reported on the recent inspection of various counties during the weekly memorial service on the 9th, stating: Due to the special environment of this district, reconstruction work faces many difficulties. However, generally speaking, the situation in each county is mostly good.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] In order to adapt to the needs of pacification affairs in northern Jiangsu, enhance the working knowledge and skills of autonomous personnel in various counties, and inspire their service spirit, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, through the Department of Civil Affairs, has ordered the formulation of a short-term training outline for township and village chiefs in the recovered counties of northern Jiangsu and ordered its strict implementation in the recovered counties.

### Chaoxian County Council Impeaches Former County Magistrate

### Replacement of Township Chief Takes Many Twists and Turns

Taihe Council Requests Provincial Investigation

[Our Taihe Dispatch] Yao Shuhua, the township chief of Huangmiao Township in Taihe, was ordered to be dismissed by County Magistrate Li Pu in October, claiming that Yao was neglecting his duties. Wang Jingbo, the township chief of Gangyu County, was appointed. Li Yang, a member of the township council, Han Ding, and all the people, believed that Wang had bad behavior and requested the county government to appoint another person or to elect a new one by the people, but they were rejected. Fearing that the situation would escalate, the county council and the county party headquarters each sent a representative to Fuyang to request the Third District Commissioner and Deputy Security Commander Men Jinglai to handle the matter. The people still refused to accept Wang. On November 3, the county government issued a new order, dispatching a platoon of soldiers to escort Wang to a new location to work. The stalemate continued. On the 15th, the Third Commissioner also sent Section Chief Lu Hejian to the county to handle the matter. Li Handing and twenty other representatives from the township went to the city on the 18th to express the people's will. Section Chief Lu expressed a compromise solution: (1) The local people should accept Township Chief Wang's appointment. (2) He personally guaranteed that he would be replaced after three months. Li Handing and others agreed. On the 19th, Li and others went to the Social Service Office in the city and, while talking to Section Chief Lu, were suddenly arrested by the county government police and sent to the Judicial Office. On the 20th, three platoons of soldiers were dispatched to Huangmiao Township to arrest gentry and Baojia chiefs who refused to accept Wang. The arrests lasted for eight days. The Taihe County Council has recently submitted the above situation to the Provincial Council to forward it to the Provincial Government, ordering the county government to quickly release Li Handing and others and send personnel to investigate.

### Many Stores in Zhenjiang Close Down, Chamber of Commerce Decides to Investigate the Truth

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] Since the Mid-Autumn Festival this year, dozens of stores, large and small, have closed down or announced the clearing of accounts. Among them, some have closed down due to sluggish business and daily losses, or have been exploited by high-interest loans. Recently, there has been a trend of stores falsely claiming bankruptcy to secretly recover their principal and interest. The amount of the closure is the money deposited by depositors. There are also many who use this to close down. The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce believes that such damage to others and self-interest is a loss of merchant morality. Yesterday, it specifically notified all guilds that if a store closes down, the Chamber of Commerce should send personnel to investigate the accounts to see if the losses are real before making a public judgment to curb the trend of closure.

### A Freak in Jiexiu, Shanxi Province: Three Heads, Wide Mouths, and Large Eyes

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 12th] In the wasteland in the northeast corner of Jiexiu City, the corpse of a newborn three-headed freak infant was recently found abandoned. The body, hands, and feet were no different from normal babies, but it had three heads, two of which were purplish-red, with mouths about two inches long, connected to the cheeks, and with teeth. The eyes were very large, crying out of their sockets, and there was a tuft of black hair outside the brain. The cause of this freak pregnancy awaits scientific research.

### Pound's Educational Discussion of the Chinese Constitution, Continued from Page 2

Fortunately, the United States did not provide a detailed explanation of the terms used when defining the functions of the government in the Constitution when it was drafted. Therefore, it was still possible to expand the functions of the central government through skillful interpretation to meet the needs of the new era. The division of powers between the central and local governments in the United States is constantly changing and is not fixed. The trend is the expansion of national affairs and the strengthening of central power. If we compare the current situation with that of forty years ago, we will know that many local affairs have become national affairs due to changes in the environment, the needs of facts, and the interpretation of the courts. The United States Constitution only stipulated the outline on this point and left the detailed points to be resolved in the future, so as to achieve the effect of adapting to the time and place, which is a good plan.

The drafters of the Chinese Constitution adopted a system of equal power between the central and local governments, which is appropriate. They only set general principles for the system of equal power without making detailed and specific regulations, so that the legislative body can legislate according to the time and place in the future, and the constitutional interpretation body can interpret according to the time and place, which is consistent with the experience of the United States Constitution, and can be said to be a good way to take the strengths of others.

(V) Guarantee of People's Rights

Since the seventeenth century, individualists and natural law schools have regarded rights as sacred and inviolable. Modern scholars deny the existence of rights. Both are extreme and should not be taken. The former overemphasizes the interests of individuals, while the latter overemphasizes the general order. In today's countries with service as the goal, the two should be coordinated and maintain a balance.

How to divide the boundary between the rights of individuals and the powers of the government varies from time to time and from place to place, so what history shows us is inconsistent. It is not easy to stipulate the rights of the people.

The provisions of the Chinese constitutional draft on this point are generally appropriate, but there is no clear provision on whether individuals can request relief from the court like the American people for the laws that violate the Constitution. If we make a comprehensive observation of Article 9, Paragraph 3, and Article 26 of the constitutional draft, if the legislative body violates the provisions of Article 25, the people seem to have no right to request relief from the court.

Whether China should adopt the American system and allow individuals to have the right to request relief for laws that violate the Constitution depends on China's environment.

The American system can be traced back to the Middle Ages. Its purpose is to prevent the arbitrariness of Congress. Although the American people have expressed dissatisfaction, the federal and state governments still adopt it to this day. The promotion of this system depends on a sound court. Its judges must not only have legal knowledge but also understand the general political, economic, and social situation. Whether China should adopt this system seems worth considering.

(VI) Distribution of Five Powers

The most prominent feature of the Chinese constitutional draft is the five-part division of government functions. I believe that "Distribution of Powers" is more appropriate than "Separation of Powers" because the former contains the meaning of confrontation with each other, while the latter does not.

As mentioned earlier, the three-power system or the two-power system is not a system that must be adopted by constitutional or democratic countries, so the five-power system may not be unsuitable for constitutional or democratic countries.

Under the five-power system, the various departments of the government have equal status, and there is no situation where one is higher than the other. France and the United States often lack coordination and undermine political consistency and continuity because the status of a certain department of the government exceeds others. Article 45 of the Chinese Constitution stipulates that "The President may convene a meeting of the heads of the five branches to discuss matters concerning more than two branches and matters consulted by the President," which is sufficient to prevent the friction that may occur in France, the United States, and other countries, and improve political efficiency.

Some people think that the establishment of two departments in addition to the three departments in China may increase friction or divergence. They do not know that Article 45 is sufficient to prevent or reduce this possibility. Moreover, this system has a considerable basis in Chinese history and can be suitable for national conditions and produce good results.

The Legislative Yuan in the constitutional draft is different from the British Parliament, and its power is quite limited. The Executive Yuan is also different from the administrative department of France, and the exercise of its functions must be controlled by the Judicial Yuan. The Executive Yuan is translated into English as "Execotive yuan," which seems to have too narrow a meaning and can be changed to A ministrative yuan (that is, the meaning of the Executive Yuan).

The Examination Yuan is a special system in China, and it has many advantages. This is indeed a good way to ensure that the appointment and removal of civil servants are separated from party politics. Due to the activity of political parties in the United Kingdom, the so-called "Spoils system" has occurred in the appointment of civil servants, that is, the political winner can distribute government positions to his party members or supporters as spoils of war. The system of the Examination Yuan can avoid this drawback. The protection of the examination power is also worthy of attention.

The Control Yuan is also a special system inherent to China that meets modern needs. What everyone can ask about is often no one asks about. Corruption of officials is often unpunished in Western countries. Some people think that the election system can punish officials for dereliction of duty, but often the matter is too long ago and the action has long been forgotten by the general public. The authority and responsibility of the committees of foreign legislative bodies, administrative officials, and prosecutors are unclear, and the performance of their reporting of officials is also difficult to be satisfactory. The power of impeachment of Congress is hated by the general public in the United States. If the Chinese Control Yuan stands in a detached position and can specialize in its duties, there are few views in the West. This system is not a product of arbitrary and abstract ideals. It has a long historical background in China and can often make great contributions.

Some people ask whether the Executive Yuan should be changed to a "responsible cabinet" controlled by the Legislative Yuan, so that the Legislative Yuan becomes the British Parliament and manages functions other than legislation. I think that this kind of provision will make the Legislative Yuan unable to devote itself to legislative work. It is a big mistake for the legislative body not to pay attention to legislation.

Some people ask whether the Executive Yuan should be responsible to the President. I think it is impossible because if so, the President will lose his detached position.

The Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial organ, and its position is quite similar to that of the House of Lords in the United Kingdom. According to my imagination, it will be composed of jurists and politicians in the future. If so, the power to interpret the Constitution can be expected to be competent.

In the Chinese constitutional draft, there is also a point worth noting, that is, the Control Yuan has the right to submit constitutional issues to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. According to the theory of this provision, the unconstitutionality of the law seems to be a dereliction of duty of the legislative body and should be sanctioned by the Control Yuan.

(VII) National Assembly

Although the National Assembly has more than two thousand representatives, it is not too large compared to the national conferences of the major political parties in the United States (with more than one thousand attendees). If appropriate talents can be involved and there are clear and reasonable provisions for the meeting's etiquette and procedures, it will not become an irresponsible mass organization.

Some people ask whether a small party-established representative organization should be established in the National Assembly. I think that this kind of system easily makes a few people become dictators. The constitutional draft has many provisions for the convocation of the National Assembly, so there is no need to adopt this system. The purpose of establishing the National Assembly is to let it ask about the major affairs of the country, and there is no need for it to manage the general affairs of the government. (End)

### Major Developments in the French Political Situation: Blum Appointed Prime Minister, All Parties Support Ending the Cabinet Crisis

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] According to reliable sources, the leaders of the National Assembly held a meeting this morning, chaired by Mr. Auriol, Speaker of the National Assembly. Socialist Deputy Tetegat announced that the leader of his party and former Prime Minister Blum had accepted the formation of a new cabinet. It was once proposed at the meeting that the current Finance Minister Schumann (Popular Republican Party) be appointed Prime Minister, but it was firmly opposed by the Communist Party, which instead formally supported Blum as a candidate. At that point, Tetegat announced that if there were no other candidates, Blum would be prepared to accept this task.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] After the French Communist Party decided to support Blum as Prime Minister, other major parties, including the Popular Republican Party, the Left Coalition, and the Republican Liberty Party, also supported Blum.

### Iranian Army Recovers Azerbaijan Province, Public Anti-Communist Sentiment Runs High, Leaders of Azerbaijan Democratic Party Flee into Soviet Territory

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 12th] The Iranian General Command announced that government troops have entered Tabriz, the capital of Azerbaijan Province, today. At the same time, left-wing newspapers in Tehran have been sealed.

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 11th] According to an official announcement, Azerbaijan Governor Jevdet has notified Iranian Prime Minister Sultana that the Azerbaijan Democratic Army surrendered this afternoon.

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 11th] Although the Azerbaijan Democratic Army has surrendered, according to news from the province, the retreating Democratic Army is now in conflict with the people in many villages. Martial law has been declared in the city of Mianeh (200 kilometers southwest of Tabriz). All leaders of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party, except Provincial Senator Vegh Bestari, have fled. It is reported that Pishevari, Chairman of the Central Committee of the party, has crossed the border and fled into Soviet territory. It is noted that the Azerbaijan "rebels" occupied Tabriz on December 12 last year and established an autonomous government. The surrender came exactly one year later.

[United Press, Tehran, 12th] Today, the Iranian government forces continued to advance towards Tabriz, the capital of Azerbaijan Province, from Mianeh and Mahabad along uneven paths, encountering no resistance along the way. The Azerbaijan Democratic People's Army stopped resisting after its political leader, Pishevari, issued a final order to flee. Thousands of people spontaneously gathered in the streets to express their national patriotism. They lined up in front of the pro-Soviet Tudeh Party headquarters and shouted: "Long live the King, long live Sultana!" fully expressing their anti-communist sentiment. At the same time, they shouted slogans against Pishevari and "all those who want to sell the country to foreigners." Afterwards, the crowds lined up in front of the Army Department to cheer for the generals who planned to recover Azerbaijan.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 11th] The Soviet side once claimed that the US government supplied the Iranian government with forty four-engine heavy bombers on the 22nd of last month. This statement was firmly denied by a spokesman for the US State Department.

### Council of Foreign Ministers Decides on the Procedure for the Moscow Conference, the Soviet Union Actually Opposes China's Participation, Five-Nation Treaty to Be Signed on February 10 Next Year

[Our New York Special Correspondent, 11th] The issue of China's participation in the Council of Foreign Ministers caused a strong friction between the two major groups of the East and the West at the first European peace drafting conference held in London in September 1945. Currently, US Secretary of State Byrnes has raised it again at the New York Council of Foreign Ministers. Byrnes advocated inviting China to attend the next Council of Foreign Ministers to participate in the drafting of the treaty with Germany, but was strongly opposed by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Molotov even opposed China from becoming one of the countries invited to the German peace conference, pointing out that the Potsdam Declaration clearly stipulated that only countries that signed the German surrender could participate in the drafting of the German peace treaty. Tonight, the four foreign ministers agreed to appoint a foreign ministry to listen to the views of the small countries on the German peace treaty, and decided to adjourn the meeting held in New York from tomorrow. At the same time, after three and a half hours of discussion, the plan for the treaty negotiations with Germany to be held in Moscow on March 10 next year has been completed. The four foreign ministers will continue to debate the issue of China's participation tomorrow afternoon at 4 pm, and will also decide on the details of the treaty with the former five subordinate countries.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 11th] The four foreign ministers held the last second session of the meeting in New York today and passed the following important motions on the German peace treaty: (1) Appoint a meeting of representatives of foreign ministers to be held in London on January 14 next year to listen to the opinions of small countries on the German and Austrian treaties. (2) Agenda of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference next year: (1) Review the report of the Allied Control Commission in Berlin; (2) Review the temporary political institutions of Germany; (3) Draft a peace treaty with Germany; (4) Study the US's proposed 40-year disarmament plan for Germany; (5) Study the reports of experts on coal production and the report of the meeting of foreign ministers' representatives on the Austrian treaty.

[Reuters, New York, 11th] The Council of Foreign Ministers today decided that the treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland will be signed in Paris on February 10 next year by the representatives of the five former enemy countries and the four countries of the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, and then signed by the foreign ministers in their respective capitals. The Council of Foreign Ministers also decided that before February 10, representatives should be appointed to form a committee to inspect the Italian colonies and submit a report.

### Disarmament Proposal Fails to Reach Agreement, Will Be Returned to General Assembly for Handling

[Associated Press, New York, November 11th] The drafting committee of the General Assembly's disarmament plan was unable to reach an immediate compromise today on the issue of investigating and disarming military forces. As a result, the focus shifted to discussing the overall disarmament plan. Chairman Spaak announced that it was impossible to reconcile the differing views of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union regarding the simultaneous investigation of domestic and foreign military forces and armaments, making it impossible to merge them as a basis for an expanded disarmament plan. This issue must now be returned to the General Assembly for handling. The drafting committee only needs to pass one more agreement to complete the general disarmament and ban on atomic bombs plan.

### Southern Countries and Albania Form Customs Union, Precursor to a Balkan Slavic Federation

[Reuters, London, November 11th] Yugoslavia and Albania have concluded a customs union agreement, the scope of which is equivalent to the economic merger of the two countries. Observers here believe that this move is the first step towards organizing a Balkan Slavic Federation. Historically, especially in the 19th century, the conclusion of a customs union was often a precursor to political unification. After World War I, France, based on this fear, opposed the conclusion of a customs union between Germany and Austria. However, as of now, there is no indication that the South-Albanian customs union will be expanded to include Bulgaria.

### China and India (Part Two) (Written by Nehru)

— Translated by Zhou Xiangguang, Our Correspondent in India

Many ancient Indian books were discovered in China around the eighth century AD. These books were all written in Sanskrit and were printed using woodblocks. The imperial printing bureau was established in China during the tenth century AD, and the printing technology developed rapidly during the Song Dynasty. At this time, exchanges between Chinese and Indian scholars were still close, such as exchanging books and classics with each other for hundreds of years. Therefore, India had printing technology at this time, but there is no sufficient evidence to prove it, and it is difficult to estimate the situation at that time. In the past, Chinese movable type printing was transmitted to Tibet. Today, I believe that Tibetan movable type printing is still the same as before. Chinese printing technology was transmitted to Europe during the Yuan Dynasty (1260-1368 AD), first to Germany, and by the fifteenth century, it had spread throughout Europe.

During the Indian Afghan and Mughal dynasties in India, China and India had frequent diplomatic contacts. For example, between 1326 and 1351 AD, Delhi Sultan Muhammad bin Tughlaq sent the famous Arab traveler Ibn Battuta as an envoy to the Chinese court. At this time, Bengal broke away from the protection of the Delhi Sultanate and became an independent Islamic kingdom. In the mid-14th century AD, the Chinese court sent two diplomatic envoys, Hu Xing and Fei Xing, to reside in the Bengal Sultan's court. This enabled Bengal to complete sending an envoy to China during the reign of Sultan Ghiyasuddin, which happened to be during the Ming Dynasty in China. Bengal's last envoy to China was during the reign of Emperor Saia-din in 1414, and they brought precious gifts, including a live qilin (Chinese unicorn). How this qilin was transported to India is quite surprising; perhaps this qilin was a gift sent from Africa, and was often offered to the Ming Emperor as a rare gift, which was praised by the Ming Emperor. Indeed, after this qilin arrived in China, it was greatly appreciated, and the disciples of Confucius recognized the qilin as an auspicious omen. There is no doubt that the qilin has a long history in China, and the Chinese embroider qilin on silk fabrics. The artists in the Chinese court have long phrases to explain how to appreciate this painting and the good fortune that can be obtained from it. Court officials and people alike watched this thing with endless appreciation.

Trade between China and India developed during the Buddhist era, and further developed during the Indian Afghan and Mughal dynasties, and continued to exchange goods. The route crossed the northern Himalayas on land and followed the original route of the camel caravans in Central Asia. However, there was also a sea trade route, passing through the islands of Southeast Asia, mainly to the ports of southern India.

Through more than a thousand years of exchanges between China and India, they have been able to understand some things from each other, not only in terms of thought and philosophy, but also in writing and science. Perhaps China has been more deeply influenced by India than India has been influenced by China, but India is also good at absorbing foreign cultures. It is regrettable that India has not obtained the essence of Chinese culture. If it had, India would have been able to use what it had obtained to stop its unnecessary fantasies. Although China has acquired a great deal of cultural art from India, she has remained independent and strong, and continues to use inexhaustibly on her own path of development, and in some places, adapting to her own social organization. Even Buddhism and its profound philosophy can be combined with the teachings of Confucius and Lao Tzu in China. But we see that Buddhist philosophy always contains a bit of pessimism, which has not been changed, and even benefits from the love of life and the optimism of the Chinese people. There is an ancient Chinese saying: "If you are caught by the yamen, you will be whipped to death; but if you are bound by the Buddha, you will starve to death."

In the sixteenth century AD, there was a famous novel in China, Journey to the West, written by Wu Cheng'en, which describes the various strange and wonderful events that Xuanzang experienced on his way to India. This book was dedicated to India: "I dedicate this book to the Pure Land of the Buddha, and I wish to repay the teacher's kindness with this book, and I wish to eliminate sins with this book..."

In the centuries after China and India lost contact, they both suffered unexpected encounters from the British East India Company. India has suffered for a long time, and China, although for a short time, also experienced the Opium War.

Now the wheel of fate is turning, and China and India look forward to the future and look back at the past. The new pilgrims who will climb the mountains will cross the continents or fly over the peaks, carrying their mission of joy and friendship, laying the foundation for close friendship.

### Soviet Troops in Germany Show Signs of Withdrawal, Espionage Personnel Active, Soviets Still Attempting to Maintain Political Control

[Associated Press, Berlin, November 11th] Soviet propaganda is once again actively spreading in Germany using new methods. American intelligence personnel strongly believe this. Spies and counter-spies are commonplace in Berlin, which is occupied by four countries, and are sometimes comical. According to a Berlin newspaper registered with the US side, the new activities of Soviet spies are due to the expectation that the boundaries of the German occupation zones will soon be eliminated, making the entire country an economic unit, and that the Western occupation zones and the Soviet occupation zone can trade freely. Once this is implemented, and the "Iron Curtain" is lifted, the Soviet side must find ways to maintain its political control and prevent the Germans in the occupation zone from being "infected" by the West. Therefore, they are using members of the United Socialist Party under the control of the Communist Party, with the assistance of the military government, to achieve electoral victories in the Soviet occupation zone. According to news from the German News Agency under British control, the United Socialist Party in the Soviet occupation zone has received the following orders: after the boundaries of the occupation zones are lifted, members of the United Socialist Party must be vigilant and pay attention to people visiting from the Western occupation zones. Even at present, leaders in each district must report uniformly. A well-informed German journalist who has close ties with the Soviet side and often travels within its occupation zone, claims that the slogan of the United Socialist Party is "Everyone is a spy." The Soviet Union is using the district leader system, where all loyal party members are responsible for maintaining the "political purity" of every resident in their district. This system was implemented when the Western Allies jointly occupied Berlin, but was later abolished due to the United States' insistence on opposition.

[Associated Press, Helmstedt, Germany, December 12th] Soviet troops, equipped as if on a large scale, are retreating eastward from the Magdeberg area near the British occupation zone. Large convoys of military trucks can be seen on the highway crossing Berlin, heading towards Dresden and then to Eastern Europe. This action appears to be part of the demobilization movement of the Soviet occupying forces, but there are not many troops to be seen, probably returning home by train. Military trucks are constantly traveling along the road, carrying or towing smaller bullock carts, which clearly indicates a large-scale eastward movement by the Soviet side.

### Dredging Waterways to Facilitate Transportation

[Associated Press, Berlin, November 11th] The Soviets in their occupied zone of Germany are currently ordering thousands of Germans to carry out the Oder River project, expanding its "safe waterway" to transport reparations to the Soviet Union. This waterway connects to the port of Szczecin, passes through the Baltic Sea and reaches Leningrad, because the railways via Poland are often plagued by bandits, and Poland itself is facing many transportation problems. Since the Germans east of the Oder-Neisse line have been expelled, the Soviet Union cannot fully utilize the Polish railways. Regarding the Oder River dredging project, the Soviet authorities have kept it secret, but according to a German journalist who recently returned from the Soviet occupation zone, the river is full of red star ships, all of which are confiscated German merchant ships, which are currently busy loading German reparations, such as manufactured factory products, and dismantled machinery and equipment.

### Slavic Congress Concludes, Next Meeting in Prague

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, November 11th] The Slavic Congress, which has been held here for several days, held its closing meeting today and decided to establish a 25-nation committee to engage in joint UN liaison work for the Slavic headquarters' information. The headquarters of the committee will be located in Belgrade. In addition, it was decided that the next Slavic Congress will be held in the Far East in 1948.

### Second Anniversary of Franco-Soviet Alliance, Paris Full of Pro-Soviet Rhetoric

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, November 11th] Today marks the second anniversary of the Franco-Soviet Alliance and Mutual Assistance Treaty. French officials praised the close friendship between France and the Soviet Union, believing that this kind of friendship is France's future political capital. It was said that France and the Soviet Union began to maintain a close friendship after signing the Mutual Assistance Treaty. The purpose of this treaty was to prevent Germany from launching an aggression again, but the fact that France and the Soviet Union often adopted the same approach when drafting the peace treaties with the five Axis powers of Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland proves that the Mutual Assistance Treaty has permanent importance. The Soviet Union has not only assisted France politically, but has also provided moral and material assistance to France in accordance with the spirit of the treaty. For example, when France faced a food shortage this spring, even though the Soviet Union itself was also facing difficulties, it still provided France with barley and wheat.

In the same statement, Attlee and Lawrence stated that the peaceful transfer of power to a freely established Indian government under the agreement of the Indian people is not only the most important special case for India, but also the most important for Asia and the entire world.

### Famous Chinese Deer Breed Survives in Britain, Antlers Point Straight Back Towards Tail

[British News Agency, London, December 12th] In 1865, a French priest obtained a deer hide in the imperial gardens of Beijing that had never been seen in the Western Hemisphere. This deer is now known as the Père David's deer, with broad flat hooves and antlers pointing straight back towards the tail, shedding its antlers twice a year. At the end of the 19th century, the Duke of Bedford in Britain tried to transplant this deer to Britain. This move saved the deer from extinction, because in 1900, the imperial gardens of Beijing were flooded, and all the deer in the gardens died. The deer currently raised in Britain are the only remaining ones in the world.

### Japan's Attitude Towards Reparations, "Mainichi Shimbun" Summarizes Seven Key Points

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, December 12th] "Mainichi Shimbun" today summarized the Japanese government's attitude towards the U.S. reparations plan, listing the main points: (1) The Japanese people's standard of living should not be lower than that of 1930.

### Preparing to Investigate Male Citizens' Backgrounds: Three-Step Process Established, to be Announced After Approval by the Senate

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to Director Zhang Xiaosong of the Civil Affairs Bureau, the conscription issue in this city has yet to receive any explicit orders. Since the last municipal meeting decided that the Civil Affairs Bureau would handle conscription matters, the first step in the bureau's preparations is to investigate male citizens in the city and create precise statistics. Currently, the bureau, in accordance with the "Regulations for Implementing Male Citizen Background Investigations in the 35th Year of the Republic" issued by the Ministry of National Defense and adapting to the actual situation in the city, has drafted the "Shanghai Municipal Government's Resolution on Implementing Male Citizen Investigations in the 35th Year of the Republic." It stipulates that district offices are responsible for the investigation of male citizens. The investigation process is as follows: (1) Training: Aimed at male citizen investigation personnel from each district, organized by the district offices. Training subjects include revised conscription laws, household registration laws, regulations on preferential treatment for families of soldiers on expedition, and regulations on penalties for hindering military administration. (2) Implementation of the Investigation: The age range for this year's conscription eligibility is calculated from those born in the 16th year of the Republic (19 years old in the traditional count) to those born in the 11th year before the Republic (45 years old). During the investigation, the month and year of birth should be inquired, and they should be informed of their zodiac sign (e.g., those born in the Year of Yichou belong to the Ox). All male citizens of conscription age, regardless of their place of origin, should be registered at their current place of residence. If the workplace and residence are in different locations, the administrative district where they were originally registered should be inquired to avoid duplicate registration and omissions. Household heads, neighborhood chiefs, and security chiefs must issue a pledge guaranteeing no omissions. After the district prepares a document to submit to the government for filing, each neighborhood will convene a neighborhood meeting to report on the investigation process and publicly report omissions and personnel who have failed in their legal duties. The above investigation tasks are assigned to specific individuals. Those at all levels who perform exceptionally well or poorly will be reported by the government to the Ministry of National Defense for separate rewards and punishments. If agencies, national organizations, schools, or factories obstruct the investigation or are found to be sheltering male citizens, they will be reported to the Ministry of National Defense for rectification. The aforementioned methods have been submitted to the Senate and will be announced and implemented upon approval.

### "Year-End Bonuses" for Various Industries: Observing the General Situation, the Problem Should Not be Serious; Strengthening Labor Discipline Still Relies on Cooperation from Both Sides

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to qualified individuals, the issue of year-end bonuses this year is limited to one month's salary and depends entirely on profit margins. On the other hand, it is implied that profitable factories should automatically increase year-end bonuses appropriately to satisfy labor's demands. At the same time, the organization of workers should be strengthened to prevent those with ulterior motives from having ample opportunities to cause disruption. In fact, this organizational work has been quite effective. The biggest proof is that in the street vendor incident, no factory workers participated. As for the issue of strengthening labor discipline, relevant personnel believe that the current lax discipline is the result of a lack of proper management during the Anti-Japanese War. What is now required of workers is, firstly, to abide by laws and regulations and maintain order; and secondly, to gradually restore pre-war production standards. In order to achieve the above goals, the authorities will strengthen the training of union leaders to instill a sense of awareness and responsibility, enabling them to lead workers onto the path of legality. The second step is to improve "factory conferences" so that representatives from both labor and management can meet together, communicate opinions, and avoid misunderstandings. Currently, many factory conferences exist in name only without achieving practical results. Insufficient understanding from the management and incorrect perceptions from the labor side are both responsible. At the same time, labor management agencies will consider the welfare of workers in their practical work and alleviate their suffering in order to gain the trust of workers and prevent agitators from using their tactics. As for the policy of passive suppression, it is the least reliable and the authorities have no intention of adopting it.

### Cotton Yarn Year-End Bonuses and Coal Allotments: Mayor Wu Discusses Three Issues

Answer: I am extremely concerned about this issue. I have instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to handle it carefully and seek a swift and reasonable resolution.

Question: Recently, the prices of coal and coal briquettes have fluctuated significantly. Is the mayor considering stabilizing them?

Answer: The management of coal in this city is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee. However, the fluctuation of coal prices is related to the people's livelihood. The Social Affairs Bureau is working to stabilize them.

### French Concession Tram Company: Labor Negotiations Approaching Conclusion

The reduction in tax rates is quite significant, greatly impacting the city's finances. It is reported that the municipal government has repeatedly telegraphed the central government to make changes, adding "in the new revised regulations, 'if the local situation is special, it can be approved by the local Senate to appropriately increase, but not exceeding double.'" However, when the above request was not answered by the central government, the new tax regulations were promulgated by the National Government, and the city should immediately comply. However, the municipal government authorities believe that the city's economic situation is extremely difficult, so they recently telegraphed the central government again, requesting that the new regulations be returned to the Legislative Yuan for further revision. Before it is raised to the National Defense Supreme Committee for resolution, they requested permission to temporarily maintain the current tax rates and methods.

Yesterday, reporters visited the person in charge of the Finance Bureau and asked about the impact of the new tax rates on the city's financial revenue. The response was: "The difference between the new tax rates and the current tax rates is very large, a reduction of about 65 percent. If the newly revised regulations are followed, the city's tax revenue would be reduced by about 6 billion yuan per month, and 70 billion yuan per year. The city government's annual revenue is only 130 billion yuan, which is 370 billion yuan short of the 500 billion yuan budgeted for next year."

### Civil Servants' Signature Campaign: Urging Implementation of Salary Adjustments and Requesting Allocation of Winter Clothing Allowance

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to central government regulations, civil servant salaries are adjusted every three months. Therefore, adjustments should have been made in November, but there has been no movement so far. Civil servants in this city have launched a real-name signature campaign yesterday, echoing the demands of civil servants in the capital, requesting the central government to implement salary adjustments in accordance with the regulations and promises, and have jointly requested the authorities to follow the example of the Four Banks and One Bureau and state-owned administrative agencies, and allocate a winter clothing allowance of 500,000 yuan. If the above request cannot be implemented immediately, then at least request permission to borrow one month's salary to get through the New Year. It is reported that more than a hundred civil servants in the Finance Bureau have signed their names.

### Many Slum Dwellings Under Protection: Changning District Ranked First

Demolition Should Only Proceed After Proper Handling

Since the municipal government decided to ban slum dwellings, in addition to strictly prohibiting the construction of new slum dwellings since the day before yesterday, an investigation of existing slum dwellings is also being implemented. Changning District, the area with the most slum dwellings, was inspected yesterday by the Senate. There are a total of 4,877 households, among which all of the 8th neighborhood are slum dwellings. In addition, neighborhoods 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 16, 20, 21, 22, 26, and 28 also have many slum dwellings. If these are demolished, the municipal government must first find a way to make proper arrangements.

### Youth Center Director: 4th Tour Group

Since the city's youth center organized the third youth tour group to visit the Taikang warship and the Jiangnan Shipyard, the participating youth have felt excited and have repeatedly requested the center to continue organizing them. It is known that the center's fourth youth tour group will be held at 9 AM on the 18th to visit Longhua Airport and airplanes. At the same time, they will take a plane for an aerial tour of the city to arouse youth's interest in aviation. It is reported that this time it is limited to 30 people, with a fee of 30,000 yuan per person (10% discount for members), and registration is now open at the center.

### Autumn Property Tax: Still According to Original Methods

Yesterday, the person in charge of the Finance Bureau stated that although the revised Property Tax Regulations were promulgated by the National Government on the 4th of this month, the municipal government has not yet received a formal order. Therefore, the city's autumn property tax and municipal construction tax will still be collected according to the original methods. The taxes currently being collected are the autumn taxes, which were before the National Government promulgated the revised Property Tax Regulations, so they are not affected by it. Moreover, the municipal government's construction tax and property tax are two different taxes, each with its own basis. Revising the municipal government's property tax regulations does not mean revising the municipal construction tax, so they are two separate matters.

### Several Districts Adjacent to the City: Requesting to be Incorporated into Shanghai Municipality

Regarding the boundary issue between Shanghai Municipality and Jiangsu Province, a plan has been drafted and is currently being reviewed by the Ministry of Interior. It is learned that several districts adjacent to the city have separately requested the municipal government and the Senate to incorporate the districts into Shanghai Municipality to meet the needs of building a Greater Shanghai. For example, Zhang Shouxiang and eight other representatives of the Huazhuang District in the 16th District, as well as various businesses in the district, recently jointly requested that the district be incorporated into the municipal government. The reasons they gave include: "Considering that the municipal government does not abandon the remote and desolate, and is generously starting to reorganize the Baojia system, organize local autonomy structures, promote education, and then establish Xinzhuang, Chunshen, and Zhang Yuban, carry out health work, protect the people's health, assist in establishing volunteer police, and promote local joint defense. The municipal government has implemented all these things step by step, so although it has not been formally taken over in name, it has already been established in fact."

### Foreigners' Land Registration Encountering Obstacles: Consulates Deliberately Making Things Difficult, Attempting to Maintain the Right to Handle It, Firmly Unwilling to be Bound by the Deadline

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the opening of land registration for foreigners in this city, registration by stateless foreigners has been very enthusiastic, but very few foreigners with nationality have registered. In terms of deadlines, the former has a deadline at the end of the year, while the latter believes that the consulates of their respective countries are subject to equal constraints. As a result, the progress of land registration for foreigners has encountered obstacles, although convenience and preferential treatment have been provided in many ways. For example, land registration by our government should normally collect registration fees. However, after the competent authorities requested instructions from the central government, it was actually handled free of charge for foreign land registration, which is already an excessive preferential treatment. However, the consulates of various countries are still not satisfied and are deliberately making things difficult. One reason is the lingering influence of their past sense of superiority, and the other is the desire to maintain the right of consulates to handle land registration during the concession era. In the unequal concessions, they even used this power to force Chinese people to sell their land at extremely low prices. Now that the concessions have been recovered, this kind of privilege that hinders our country's sovereignty can never be allowed to continue. It is also learned that the requests to have consulates register land on behalf of foreigners are most strongly supported by the British and French, while the attitude of the United States is not very active.

### Suggestion to Abolish Fuel Control: Executive Yuan Replies to the Senate That Now is Not the Time; International Industrial Exhibition Should Also Be Postponed

[Our Newspaper's Report] Senator Wang Zhengyan of the Municipal Senate previously proposed at the General Assembly to abolish fuel control. Speaker Pan and Deputy Speaker Xu Jifu transferred the proposal to the municipal government for submission to the Executive Yuan for approval. Now the Senate has received a telegram from the Executive Yuan, transferred through the Municipal Government, stating that it is difficult to comply. The telegram stated: "The public transportation industry and power in Shanghai mostly use bituminous coal, and most citizens use white coal for cooking. After the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee took effective measures such as centralized management to support various regions, increase production, and expand transportation capacity, the market price has been quite stable and the supply is sufficient since March of this year. There is no coal shortage. The so-called panic about coal shortages is likely referring to the white coal briquettes used for heating in wealthy families. The price increase of these white coal briquettes does not affect public transportation power or cooking. Moreover, merchants can freely transport and sell these white coal briquettes, which are not under government control. However, because they can be freely transported and sold, they are not being controlled. When winter is approaching, wealthy families compete to hoard them, and merchants take the opportunity to manipulate the market, causing a shortage panic. The Senate believes that coal merchants have limited capacity to mine and transport white coal and cannot supply the market in large quantities. We are working to purchase them in various ways and plan to sell the newly arrived white coal at factory prices to increase supply and stabilize the black market. Currently, the distribution of coal is based on a reasonable method, so the request is not the right time."

Also, the Municipal Senate resolved at its first general meeting to suggest that the Ministry of Economic Affairs hold an international industrial exhibition in Shanghai on September 3rd next year. The Executive Yuan also believes that the scale of this matter is grand and must be based on sound industrial construction before it can be prepared. Moreover, the country's post-war recovery work has not yet been completed, and it may not be possible to hold it at that time, so it should be postponed.

### Preventing Theft of Goods: Implementing Ship-Based Security

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the resolution of the American sailors' strike, about sixty UNRRA relief material transport ships will arrive in Hong Kong in succession within two weeks. In order to prevent theft of goods, the Municipal Port Affairs Committee invited relevant agencies to discuss responsibilities. The methods are as follows: (1) After UNRRA relief material ships arrive in Lujiazui, the Security Affairs Section of the Shanghai Storage and Transportation Bureau of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) will notify the Inspection and Security Group in writing one day in advance about the location of the ship and the loading and unloading of goods and security matters. The group will then notify the Water Police Bureau, the Port Police Department, or the Security Police Corps to send police to be responsible for security. (2) In order to ensure thorough security and clear responsibility for UNRRA relief materials, the principle of "ship-based security" will be adopted. From the ship's side or the dock to the warehouse, the supervision of ship transportation, handling, and stacking will be carried out by the responsible security units. The responsible persons will sign a joint military agreement to clarify responsibilities. (3) The ships' sailors handling the UNRRA relief materials are not allowed to take any items off the ship during unloading and may be inspected by security personnel. (4) CNRRA must send a list of the names, labels, and organization of the relief materials transported to China this time to the group, which will then be forwarded to the Criminal Investigation Division of the Municipal Police Bureau, so that the anti-theft departments will pay attention to prevent the sale of stolen goods on the market. (5) The inspection group will send personnel to observe the work of each security unit for assessment purposes.

### Restoring the Pre-War Foreman System: Negotiating Standards for Handling Fees

The prevalence of theft at the ports in this city makes companies and merchants anxious and difficult to cope with. Most of these pickpockets collude with dock cargo handlers. Therefore, in order to avoid losses to customers, each port company, holding a Borrowing Opinion certified by the Shipping Association, forwarded it to the Transportation and Obligation Affairs Committee. After discussions, it was decided to restore the pre-war factory foreman system, allowing each shipbuilding company to freely hire factory workers and assign foreman personnel to be responsible for transportation, loading, and unloading. Currently, this foreman system has been implemented first by Dalian and Datong Lianjing, and they have published announcements about the names and job scopes of the foreman personnel responsible for supervision. At the same time, the Port Affairs Committee, in order to reverse the handling fees at the port, will unite with relevant parties to organize a handling fee review committee to negotiate reasonable fees. However, before deciding on the handling fees, the control work should be the prerequisite. The standard of labor costs for each item should be based on the actual monthly wages of the dock workers, with the number of working days per month as the monthly wage, and then divided by the average number of items handled by the workers each day, which is the labor cost per item. In addition, add a certain percentage separately as supervision fees, company management fees, and company profits, which is the standard handling fee rate. The above plan has been submitted by the Port Affairs Committee to the Social Affairs Bureau for research.

### Gunboat Collides with Dock Boat: Boat Captain Responsible for Accident Summoned

[Our Newspaper's Report] At 10 AM on the 3rd of this month, on the Huangpu River at the 9th Pier of the China Merchants Bureau in Nanshi, a large dock boat loaded with bricks and tiles owned by Pan Zhaorui (44 years old) from Zhuicheng was heading northwest when it was head-on collided by the Jiangsui gunboat of the First Base Command of the Navy Department. Pan's second son, Guoli, drowned and his body has not been recovered. Yesterday, a report was made to the Water Police Sub-bureau. The traffic police dispatched police to summon Wu, the captain of the gunboat, for questioning. It was determined that he was suspected of negligent injury. In addition to being released on bail by the First Base Command of the Navy Department, the entire case was transferred to the Garrison Command for disposal. However, the captain denied any wrongdoing, claiming that this paper was insufficient to prove him guilty. The case is scheduled for another hearing on the 19th of this month.

### Testimony in U.S. Military Tribunal: Ohler Stated Takashima Requested Continued Cooperation from Germany, Denies Knowledge of Personnel Working for Japan

[Reported by this newspaper] Ohler, wartime head of the intelligence agency for the Far East in the town of Lin Yuan, testified yesterday as a witness in a U.S. military tribunal that several days after Germany surrendered in 1945, representatives of the Japanese military came to Ohler's office to take over. At that time, the agency's assets consisted of 30 ounces of pure gold, a quantity of silver dollars, over 130,000 marks in the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, and over 100,000 marks deposited in Tokyo. The Japanese side did not confiscate these assets at the time, but a month later converted the bank deposits into overseas Chinese reserve certificates, giving half to the Japanese side and allowing Ohler to control and use the remaining half.

Ohler admitted that Takashima, the head of the Japanese intelligence agency in Shanghai at the time, had asked him to continue cooperating. However, he did not agree. Regarding the voluntary continued work of some of Ohler's agency personnel for the Japanese side, he testified that he was unaware of it at the time. However, the subtle point was that he also admitted that after his activities with the Japanese leaders had changed, he was still able to continue occupying the agency's address, and a few days later, a secret telephone line was installed, connecting to Takashima's office.

### Theater Manager Disregards the Law, Assaults Finance Bureau Personnel, Burns Evidence of Tax Evasion

[Reported by this newspaper] The Finance Bureau recently received reports of tax evasion at the Lianhe Hebei Grand Theater at 791 Tianyun Road in this city. As a result, at 11:00 AM yesterday, two senior officials were dispatched, along with investigators, to conduct an investigation. Inside the theater's employee dormitory on the second floor, they seized various tax ledgers and receipts related to tax evasion. Just as they were about to investigate, Wang Yongli, the theater's manager in charge of preparations and operations, began to argue forcefully and ordered the theater employees to pull down the iron gate, intending to reclaim the tax evasion ledgers. However, the Finance Bureau personnel refused. Seeing that his objective was not achieved, Cheng, with a yell to strike, seized the ledgers and burned them. Two senior officials from the Finance Bureau were beaten and injured. Upon receiving the news, the North Station Sub-bureau dispatched police to quell the situation, bringing both parties to the station for interrogation. It was learned that the theater did indeed have evidence of tax evasion and that Cheng had openly assaulted and insulted public officials. After a preliminary trial by Sub-bureau Chief He, the evidence was confirmed, and he ordered the detention of Cheng Wei and Wang Yongting, pending transfer to the District Procuratorate for legal proceedings.

### Work Competition Promoted in Production and Transportation Sectors

The Work Competition Promotion Committee, considering that the production and transportation sectors in the Shanghai-Nanjing region occupy an important position nationwide, believed that the implementation of work competition methods to improve efficiency and increase production would greatly benefit national economic construction. To this end, it specially dispatched team leader Yang Boqing and commissioner Zou Ping, along with team leader Chen Kui from the Ministry of Transportation's competition team, to Shanghai. They consulted with the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, intending to first hold work competitions on safe journeys, punctual arrivals, fuel conservation, and ship cleanliness. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will assign a dedicated person to be responsible. The Maritime Affairs Bureau will convene a meeting of industry and labor union leaders to discuss implementation methods soon.

### Love Triangle: Bodyguard Kills, Wu Guorong Appeals, High Court Concludes Hearing Yesterday

[Reported by this newspaper] Wu Guorong, a bodyguard at the Kong Mansion, had a wife named Lu Lilien, who resided in Shanghai. When the Pacific War broke out, Wu was working under Director Sui in America. After the city fell and communication with Wu in America was cut off, Wu's wife, Lu Lilien, moved to the home of her husband's uncle, Wu Rongfang. Due to the cessation of remittances from America, she faced financial difficulties. She then met Xu Li, an official at the pseudo-Minhang Tax Investigation Office, and lived with him. After the victory, Wu Guorong returned and took Lu Lilien back, residing at 7 Yanping Village, Wenlin Road. The couple's feelings for each other had not diminished. However, Wu was unaware of his wife's cohabitation with Xu. Later, Xu often used this as blackmail, asking Lu for money. Lu often entrusted her sister-in-law, Tong, to deal with him, giving him property on multiple occasions. On March 10th of this year, Xu went again and coincidentally encountered Wu Guorong himself on Hengzhong Road. Xu reported everything that had happened before, claiming that he had taken care of Wu's wife, Lu Lilien, for six years and now demanded to support her for three years, with Wu providing housing and all living expenses. On March 19th, Wu visited Xu again to continue negotiations. The matter could not be resolved immediately. Wu hired a rickshaw to Xu's home in Tushanwan for further secret talks. Upon arriving there, Wu drew a gun and killed Xu Li before fleeing. Later, after police investigation, he was arrested and prosecuted by the District Procuratorate for murder. On June 24th of this year, he was sentenced to five years imprisonment by the District Court. Wu, dissatisfied with the sentence, appealed to the High Court. The hearing was held yesterday. Wu claimed that the rickshaw was stolen by Xu and after arriving in Tushanwan, Xu invited several leniency. The court will pronounce the verdict at 2:00 PM on the 20th of this month.

### Domestic Films Need Support, Lack of Funds and Equipment, Filmmakers' Lives are Hard

[Special Feature by This Newspaper] We who make films must of course intensify our efforts to improve domestic films and increase production. But at the same time, we also hope that people from all walks of life can support domestic films and help them overcome the current difficulties. Chinese films have a future, but first they must overcome this obstacle. After chatting with reporters about the current state of domestic films, Xu Suli, director of the China Film Studio, made the following conclusion.

Now, the materials, "war use," scenery, remuneration, and some operating expenses for filming a movie cost approximately 250 million yuan. Due to the sluggish market, high prices, and restrictions on Nanyang bridges, the revenue from the first two or three runs is often not enough to cover the cost. The domestic film business is currently best in Shanghai and Nanjing.

Among the recent domestic new films released in this city: "The Family of Shi Yi," "Return to the Mortal World," "Records of the Holy City," "Lotus Turns White, Swallows Fly," and "Iron Bones, Ice Hearts," "The Loyal Family" performed the best. At the Grand Light, it played for one month and two days, and the revenue from the first run was enough to cover the cost. The main reason was that it was the first domestic new film released after the victory.

Currently, domestic films struggle to be shown in better-equipped cinemas. On the one hand, because those theaters have economic ties with American production companies, they of course prioritize showing American films; on the other hand, because there are fewer domestic films produced and their quality is worse, it is not easy to win over theaters. However, there are some enthusiastic cinemas that like to show domestic films.

Reasons for slow production

As for the reasons for the slow production of domestic films: (1) Insufficient capital, because the cost is extremely high and the revenue is low, so the turnover is inflexible. (2) The equipment is too poor, and it is verified to improve it immediately. (3) Not enough talent.

Speaking of the lives of film practitioners, they are also quite hard. Ordinary people think that movie stars must lead luxurious and comfortable lives, but in China, this is not the case.

Now, the remuneration for film awards is mostly calculated on a per-movie basis, and long-term contracts are rarely signed. This is because prices are constantly rising, and signing a contract is inevitable. Moreover, film companies cannot afford huge salaries. Currently, the remuneration for a famous actor starring in a film is approximately 10 million yuan, but they can only make two or three films a year. As for supporting actors, the remuneration is calculated on a daily basis, approximately 20,000 to 50,000 yuan per day. Those extras are even worse, earning only 8,000 to 10,000 yuan per day.

The cost of directing a film ranges from 4 million to 10 million yuan. The remuneration for writing a film script is approximately 2 to 3 million yuan. There is currently no problem with film business. It usually takes approximately 20,000 to 30,000 feet of film to shoot a movie. The actual length of the film is approximately 10,000 feet. As for the venue equipment and machines, they are all too backward.

New films are completed one after another

Finally, let's talk about the festivals of various production companies. China Film Second Factory has already released two films: "The Loyal Family" and "Orioles Fly in the Mortal World." "Love from Afar," directed by Chen Shengting, has also been filmed and is currently being edited. It can be released around the solar New Year. Currently being filmed or about to be filmed are "Returning Home in Glory," directed by Zhao Dan and starring Tan Ying; "Spring Dream in Heaven," directed by Tang Xiaodan and starring Lu Ming; "Welcoming Spring Song," directed by Wu Shuiguan and starring Jin Hua. Planned to be filmed are "Heavenly Sins and Earthly Traps," directed by Ma Chuwei, and "The Legend of the Eight Immortals," directed by Fang Pei.

China Film First Factory used to specialize in shooting news documentaries and was responsible for washing and printing work. Recently, it is preparing to produce "Homecoming Diary," directed by Zhang Junxiang and starring Bai Jing.

The "Shanghai Film Experimental Factory," hosted by Fei Mu, has been working silently. "Money Bones, Ice Hearts" has already been released, and "Beautiful Rivers and Mountains" will also be able to meet the audience soon.

As for the Lianzhong Film Studio, the United Film Company plans to shoot Shen Congwen's "Border Town," directed by Ye Zhen. Phoenix Film Company is also filming "Eight Thousand Miles of Clouds and Moon" and "A River of Spring Water Flows East" there. Lianzhong's site is the largest in Shanghai.

The Cathay Film Company, hosted by Liu Zhonghao, is filming two films. One is "Sparks of the Nation," directed by Yang Xiaozhong, and the other is "Song of Leaving Home," directed by Li Pingqian.

As for other cities, Beijing has the "China Film Third Factory." "Record of the Holy City" has already been released. Currently being filmed is "Top Secret Number One," directed by Shuguang and starring Ouyang Shafei.

Changchun's "China Film Fourth Factory," also known as "Changchun Film Studio," is hosted by Jin You, taking over the former "Manchukuo Film." However, all the equipment was taken by the Communist Party, so they can only shoot newsreels now. The film industry in Hong Kong is constantly booming. Such as "Dahua Film Company" and "National Film Company."

In short, domestic films definitely have a future. But it needs everyone's support, everyone's love.

[Also] Councilor Jiang Jizhou proposed that, based on the Council's first General Assembly's resolutions on education and the Ministry of Education's regulations on normal schools, draft measures to organize the city's normal schools for public resolution. The measures to organize normal school education are as follows: (1) Normal schools should be established separately in accordance with the Education Bureau's regulations, and male and female schools should be separated.

Land Administration Committee The Land Administration Committee had six councilors in attendance, chaired by Wang Xianqing.

It is estimated that all of it can be collected by the end of this year. (2) Regarding the question of whether to abolish the housing rent standard, a consulting committee will be convened before the end of this month for detailed study. (3) Regarding encouraging the construction of houses to solve the housing shortage, a draft of the Shanghai Municipality's Implementation Rules for Encouraging the Construction of Houses and Leasing Public Land has been specifically drafted and submitted to the municipal meeting for approval.

### Citizens Suggest Three Points to Improve Public Health

[Reported by this newspaper] The City Council yesterday received a letter from citizen Ding Fubao of this city, suggesting that the city government improve the city's sanitation facilities. The letter stated: More than a year after the victory, the city government has taken over the city's administration and has achieved remarkable results. However, there are still some areas that the Health Bureau has not fully addressed. Therefore, three points are suggested: (1) Since the Sanitation Office took over from the bureau, the city treasury has increased a large income every month. However, the price of fertilizer sold should be adjusted to meet the needs of rural fertilization. It should not follow the contractor's approach of arbitrarily increasing the selling price, regardless of farmers' purchasing power. At the same time, the work part should also be updated and renewed. (2) Public toilets are set up for the benefit of the common people in the city. They should be directly managed by the City Health Bureau, with the goal of the lowest price for toilet paper to benefit the common people. This is in line with the original intention of setting them up, and the city government can also increase revenue every month. However, the bureau still adopts the old contractor system, allowing layers of exploitation by large and small contractors, with some profiting from it. This should be improved. (3) The amount of garbage discarded in this city every day is considerable. This matter should also not be handled by contractors, because contractors only seek profit, and the transportation work is often perfunctory, resulting in accumulation from time to time. At the same time, there are very few transport ships, and they leak along the way, causing siltation in the inland rivers and the Huangpu River. It is hoped that the authorities can purchase landing craft for large-scale transportation.

### Women's Cultural Society to Open Tomorrow

[Reported by this newspaper] The Chinese Women's Cultural Society, initiated and organized by Wu Yuan and Luo Jianbing, has been prepared and is scheduled to open tomorrow on North Sichuan Road.

Currently, it is planned to first establish a women's school and a reading room, and publish women's publications.

 　　〔香港九日訊〕「青白隊此次南來，實開戰後港滬體育界互相聯繫之先河，體育本不重勝負，青白隊能表現良好之體育精神，使港人得覩一場良好球賽，至爲可喜。」
 
 　　這是我國出席台維斯杯網球賽代表蔡惠全九日晚在星島體育會歡宴青白隊席上演說的一段話。青白隊此次不遠千里，惠然南來，真是一九四六年香港體境的一個盛大壓軸表演。自本月開始，港中報章即連續出刊青白隊員抵港的消息，一般球迷紛紛推論未來戰局。十二月的日子，正是本港足球季節的中心，快活谷裏，銅鑼灣頭，早已殺氣喧騰，中外球員，打得落花流水，青白隊則於此時出戰，真個錦上添花。
 
 　　籃球隊　　兩場連戰連勝
 
 　　青白隊挾持兩支人馬籃球與足球，奔向南國小島來，香港是中國足球隊的搖籃地，青白似乎胸有成竹，所以改用籃球隊出馬，七日八日連接兩場，雙雙告捷，不愧名將本色。這兩場一對港中籃球的最堅強的隊伍—青年會，以四五對卅五先敗後勝，一對港中精銳的黑貓隊、以七十對十廿九去的一面倒的大捷。青白籃球英雄們經過兩演身手，港中批評家給了他們十四字的評論，那是：
 
 　　「一個人演出有成就，全隊聯絡未見好。」
 
 　　主力戰　　九月正式揭幕
 
 　　　青白隊的主力戰，到了九日才正式揭幕，兩天前，青白的龍員虎將，先後由滬粵來港，青白的對手，是港中本屆足球賽實力最強的星島隊，雙方人馬，幾經考慮，最後決定了陣勢如下：
 
 　　靑白隊
 
 　　秦必高　嚴士鑫　吳祺祥　宋霆聖　孟義良　瞿永福　許文奎　羅壽福　李義臣　高保正　費春華
 
 　　星島隊
 
 　　朱兆恒　譚江柏　侯容生　馮坤勝　許克成　劉松生
 
 　　曹秋亭　黎兆榮　張金海　馮景祥　何應芬
 
 　　七分鐘　　背白便告失守
 
 　　九日過午加路連山頭，以佈滿無數球迷，門票分二元四，三元五兩種，購買入座者約二千人，收入萬元，折合國幣已過一千萬。老天好像厚愛於香港人，星島果然以一對雰告捷，這個千萬金換不來的得勝之球，在開場七分鐘後便踢進青白的球門裏。此後雙方攻守，各無所得。青白之失，其咎似在「用非其材」，全綫不夠完整。
 
 　　李義臣　　給許竟成釘煞
 
 　　許文奎原始內鋒的好人材，這次改任左翼，是青白缺少這個角色的原故。費春華的步法不錯，可是足部受傷未愈，戰來極不濟事。青白隊的一雙外翼，既有這些不良狀態，前鋒綫於是有「雁行折翼」之　。羅壽福與高保正，雖是不畏猛虎的初生之犢，但功夫究竟未「老」，沒法支撐陣腳不穩的前鋒綫。「懶牛」李義臣，給許竟成釘着，雖不懶也無能爲力，無怪青白不能威脅星島的大關。青白不致多負，是守衛人員，尤其是一雙後衛的豐工偉績。嚴士鑫與吳祺祥的頭腳工夫，都比前有進步，獲得座上客的好評。秦必高是初到「貴」境的球客，他在這溫和天氣的香港仍穿上了手套。這成了攝球的大障碍，他也不擅接地球，但對高球和衝刺的救護，有相當的把握。
 
 　　這一球　　是如此失去的
 
 　　在那七十分鐘的激戰中，青白已失去了他們的「下馬威」，但以後還有三場比賽——十一日對南華，十三日對華聯，十六日對港聯，青白諸將雄心勃勃，也許可以打個勝仗。星島僅以一球之勝，實在也不見的「高強」多少哩。青白哪一個勝敗攸關的球，是這樣失去的：球戰開始，李義臣發動攻勢，星島不就便奪球而前，一時你來我往，速度甚高。打得幾個回合，即見何應芬邊陲猛進，一腳傅中，黎兆榮先取定位置，球來便射，嚴士鑫迎面來左，本從右去的球兒卻擦中士鑫之身反向左飛，秦必高滿擬球向右飛，不道中途改道，於是忙轉身來接，雖然接着，可是球來甚　，因匆忙轉身，卻接的不牢，卒被脫手漏入門內。青白失去了一球，以後使奮力壓倒了星島的攻勢，因此以後調整人馬，改變陣綫，便可有戰勝的希望吧。

The Spring and Autumn Cactus - A Brief Note on a Trip to Yunnan 2 Lin Yongchun
The green cakes, with pointed tops and bottoms connected, have different forms, like inverted tops, stacked Arhats, or oval hand mirrors. Is she admiring her reflection? Is she dabbing her lips? Is she arranging her temples and drawing her eyebrows?
The cakes have needle-like thorns, like nets, like a young woman's coiled hair, like a clear green lake with raindrops dotting it.
In spring, these sturdy green cakes grow small, cup-shaped spheres at their tips, like wine glasses. Are they waiting for sweet dew? Welcoming sweet dew? But the poor villagers, enduring bitterness, pick them and take them to the city to sell them. In that flower-selling paradise of long streets, it is said that they are even considered food, and that those who love wine even eat the wine glasses!
Wild places have many treasures, but it is not precious in the wild. Look: on the roofs, by the earthen embankments, at the edges of the fields... it grows without choosing the soil. It forms walls, thorny fences; it lives together with wildflowers and weeds.
You who love flowers, tend flowers, decorate potted landscapes, and embellish your garden: come here, come and pick these green cakes, and learn the posture of morning makeup!

### Tchaikovsky's Love
Li Wenxun

The love life of the great Russian musician Tchaikovsky is very interesting, because he was too poor. His teacher, the famous pianist Nikolai Rubinstein, had to ask a wealthy widow named Nadezhda von Meck for help. She was a very eccentric aristocrat, very stubborn and reserved, but there was one thing she couldn't resist - music. Music would make her forget to eat and sleep, as if drunk and enchanted, sometimes making her feel lighthearted, sometimes making her tremble. She sighed and said:
"What kind of magical power is this that makes my whole being collapse..."
Nikolai brought Tchaikovsky's new work "The Tempest" to visit her. She knew that this pianist would not come without a purpose. She smiled and watched him approach the piano, then quickly went inside, as was her old habit, to sit alone in a room and listen to music quietly in the dark... Nikolai began, using his magical fingers to play, and a mysterious land unfolded before her eyes.
When the music ended, Nadezhda appeared, with the rustling sound of her dress. She was breathing heavily with pleasure!
"Who composed it?" she asked softly.
"Tch...ai...kov...sky," Nikolai replied solemnly, "He is a genius."
"You don't need to praise him; his music is enough to explain!"
This wealthy widow, who had eleven children, began to fall in love with Tchaikovsky's music. She asked him, "In the days after hearing your 'The Tempest,' I fell into an uncontrollable sea of unfortunate emotions..."
At this time, the impoverished Tchaikovsky urgently needed money, and also eagerly longed for a kindred spirit. The wealthy widow, who lived a very dry life, also needed a confidante, needed a kind of vitality. Thus, love began.
"Mr. Peter Ilyich; your kind reply gave me the happiness I have longed for for so long... I ask you to give me your photo. If you are unwilling, simply refuse me, do not offer explanations. Explanations frighten me..."
"There was a time when I really wanted to meet you. Now, the more I love you, the less I want to meet you. At present, I would rather enjoy the sweet longing alone, confessing my feelings to you in your music. Your music is my beautiful homeland..."
"The photo you sent has been received, countless thanks. Your photo makes my world and days shine. I would be unspeakably happy if you would allow me to have another new one. I know you don't like taking photos, but since you have decided to take another one, please adopt the same pose! Fix those thoughtful eyes on me, because any man who does not look at me is arrogant, and I don't like it..."
"Yesterday I returned from St. Petersburg, truly unfortunate - I didn't get to hear your opera Vakula the Smith. I must find a way to make up for this loss, so I ask you, Peter, to write me a piece of music that can be heard as sad and disappointed, and even, if you think it appropriate, can still be heard as the sweet breath of death..."
But as a sincere artist, he could not, like a chef, cook delicious dishes according to the diners' tastes. Anything could be careless, but not the faithful belief in art, he said;
"Dear Nadezhda: I am very ashamed that every letter comes with money. Although it is not a disgrace for an artist to receive payment for his work, the kind of music you want me to write requires a kind of awakening called "inspiration," just like any other creation, and this kind of thing does not come at will. I am unwilling to pretend for money, and I do not want to use my skills to pass off fake things as real, but my need for money is so urgent..."
"I am currently busy writing a fourth symphony, and I want to dedicate this piece of music to you..." Tchaikovsky, a bachelor for thirty-seven years, had lost the frivolous habits of his youth, but had fallen into another state of mental unease, perhaps due to physiology. This was originally a fertile piece of land, but now it had become barren. At this time, a young woman named Antonina entered this piece of land, she was young and beautiful, and passionately loved Tchaikovsky... Tchaikovsky carefully and gently told Nadezhda about this.
"Now let me introduce my fiancée! Her name is Antonina Ivanovna Milyukova, she is twenty-eight years old, has a beautiful appearance, a good reputation, is an independent woman, has received secondary education, and is very generous..." After receiving this letter, Nadezhda replied immediately, without any of the sourness of an ordinary woman, maintaining the identity and tone of a generous aristocrat. In this letter, she proposed the ways in which they would communicate in the future, either discussing personal life or focusing on music... Tchaikovsky completely agreed. Nadezhda continued to send him money, even sending him money for the wedding. In October 1877, Nadezhda sent him six thousand rubles, a huge sum that was a tonic for Tchaikovsky. From then on, he could live a quiet life, his full energy filled with music. Nadezhda wrote to him:
"I will give you money, you can write with peace of mind."
Tchaikovsky's fame grew day by day, and he became an authority in the Russian music scene. But in 1890, he unexpectedly received a letter in which Nadezhda proposed that their correspondence could come to an end, without any reason. Tchaikovsky was greatly shocked and almost fell down. They had never met. He had to leave, go to the United States, and hold a concert in Paris, which was unprecedentedly successful and conquered the arrogant music city, but that beautiful love would never return.

Me and the Banana Tree
Yao Peng

When it's late at night, waking up from a dream, I suddenly hear the sound of fine rain outside the window, hitting the banana leaves - the sound is both dense and intimate, like a loving mother's earnest warning, instructing "return early," and like the earnest whispers of children, urging "take care of yourself." Because of the separation and homesickness that are stirred up, I often toss and turn, feeling lost and unable to resolve it all night.
However, in my hometown in the north, there are no banana trees...
And my fondness for banana trees seems to have begun when I was still a very young child. I don't remember exactly how I first had this preconceived idea - sifting through the tangled memories, I remember an ancient painting in my grandfather's study.
Speaking of that painting, I can't help but think of that exquisite and shady study, and at the same time, my grandfather's kind face immediately appears in my memory.
Whoever you are, when you walk into that old house, sit comfortably on that soft chair for a while, facing two pots of half-blooming wintersweet, quiet and serene. In the small incense burner on the desk, an unknown incense is occasionally lit, the fragrance subtle, the light blue smoke rising curlingly, seeming to entrust your ethereal fantasies. Receiving sunlight from the window, watching the fallen flowers rustling in the courtyard - "This is not a place for reading, only for resting." Breathing in the warm and quiet atmosphere all around, just drinking a cup of hot tea, you may feel that you have not only seen this residence, but also understood the owner of this house.
Like many old people, my grandfather also kept a very long beard, moved relatively slowly, didn't like to talk much, was particular about his diet, but didn't pay attention to his clothing at all. - And what made my grandfather somewhat different from other old people was that he didn't have the stubbornness and prejudice that came with old age. He would rather be lonely and lonely himself than force others to follow his opinions. Therefore, the study was his little world. At the same time, in this little world, he did not want to be disturbed in his peaceful thoughts.
However, because of excessive pampering, I often liked to spend time in the study. Of course, I couldn't appreciate the Peiwen Yunfu, let alone the Sanxitang Calligraphy Collection. However, the paper and pens on the desk that I could use freely had already given me great temptation. My grandfather's beloved "Yunzi" chess pieces, black and white, shiny and lustrous, also made me "appreciate" them very much; and what attracted me the most was the paintings on the wall that were often changed, and the many stories that my grandfather told me because of those paintings.
Struggling to climb onto the desk, the olive-shaped papaya, the ox-shaped bronze incense burner, smoking from its ears and nose, the ink box with carved patterns, the bronze paperweight, etc., these were all played with until they were dirty. Even when I felt that "getting Grandpa tobacco" and "trimming Grandpa's beard" were no longer interesting, I would often say -
"Grandpa, tell me a joke, didn't you not finish telling it last time?"
The paintings on the wall were often changed, so my grandfather's stories were also often new. To this day, I can still recall that most of those stories were taken from notebooks like Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio. Of course, the stories and the paintings were completely unrelated, but at that time, I couldn't find anyone else in the family who could tell so many tortuous and subtle stories.
My first impression of "banana tree" was from a painting in my grandfather's study. I guess it was probably a painting of a beautiful woman. A young woman in a light crimson dress was shown from behind, with a rather tall banana tree behind her, green and verdant, with such broad leaves that I was very surprised.
I tried hard to recall that story many times afterwards, but unfortunately I couldn't find any clues. I only vaguely remembered that the banana tree transformed into a person in green clothes. I couldn't remember what happened afterwards - of course, I can only make it up now, but when I think of that vague and beautiful memory, I would rather keep that largely incomplete story and let it live forever in my memory!
After that, for some reason, I always longed to see a real, growing banana tree. The more I couldn't get it, the more I yearned for it, which led me to become a fan of banana trees.
I really saw banana trees only in the past two or three years; at that time, the war was raging; I had just started from Peiping and secretly crossed the confrontation line. The Nationalist army on the Henan front lost, and I also fled west in a panic, passing through Guanzhong, crossing the Qinling Mountains, and wandering into Sichuan. Although I experienced all kinds of hardships, I finally realized my long-cherished wish. On a deep autumn evening, when the trees were bare and the drizzle was continuous, with the heart of a pilgrim, I carried my simple and poor luggage and walked up the stone steps of the mountain city.
The environment was novel and unfamiliar to me, the customs were very different, and I couldn't understand the language. There were so few acquaintances that I could almost say there were none. Sitting alone in a small room, I worried about my future every day, and often hesitated about my life in reality.
It was at this time that I saw the banana tree.
There was one behind the guesthouse, not tall and not green, far less beautiful than I had imagined, but at first sight, it was as if I had met a long-time friend, and I felt an indescribable sense of emotion and joy in my heart. Afterwards, I often closed the door during the day and stayed alone in the bamboo house unique to Chongqing, opened the window, had thick fog in the morning, looked out at the vast Yangtze River, and the banana tree swayed its palms in the wind, just like a good friend was sitting there. Whether I was reading the family letter woven with sorrow and resentment, or writing an article, when I saw it, I seemed to have received infinite comfort in my heart, relieving a lot of sadness and burden on my soul.
I remember that night a guest came from my hometown, braving the rain that had been falling for half a month to visit, and told me the sad news of "Grandfather's death." At that time, the War of Resistance was difficult and my mood was extremely sad and indignant. Suddenly encountering such an accident, I really felt unable to bear it!
And at night, a light rain knocked on the banana leaves - this was no longer an enjoyment for me, it seemed to hit my heart with every sound, chilling my chest and shattering my dreams.
Since then, I have not dared to sit alone in the shade of the banana tree. I no longer count the days hoping for the unfolding of the newly grown leaves. I hate even more the noisy and monotonous sound of the rain hitting the banana tree!
This year, I left Sichuan and moved to this Jiangnan region that also has a lot of rain - but I rarely see banana trees, so I miss them again.
Banana trees symbolize the abundance of southern feelings, the unrestrained vitality. It is not as ancient and frugal as pine and cypress, nor is it as self-admiring as plum blossoms and orchids. It receives wind and rain with a heart that doesn't care, and sends sorrow and resentment to the world indifferently! - I certainly shed tears when I heard the sound of rain hitting the banana tree, but my worries were finally soothed as a result.
Missing the banana tree, I also miss my hometown, which is thousands of miles away and has no banana trees. My grandfather is dead, and I am afraid that my old house no longer exists, and that painting...

Wall Painting Draft
Giotto

Giotto (1267-1337) was originally an ordinary shepherd boy. After Cimabue took him as a student, he progressed very quickly. He also associated with the poet Dante and others, and soon became a famous artist of the time. His style was strict and vibrant. After the age of fifty-eight, he stopped painting and engaged in sculpture and architecture. The existing marble "Giotto Tower" in Florence is his work in his later years. Art historians call him the "progenitor of modern painting," which means that the Italian Renaissance began with him. This sketch has been preserved for so long and is still as good as new, which is especially rare. (Lion)

Poetic Words
Tian Su

Poetry is sometimes like a pool of still water, clear to the bottom, but sometimes like a surging wave; and sometimes, like a narrow stream, flowing around twists and turns, passing jagged rocks, and fragrant flowers and plants.

The Flame of Life
Ye Cao

Just as dawn broke, Li Yitang was already working in the damp and muddy ground.
Using the broken bamboo and wood, tied together with knotted hemp rope, he carefully built a thatched shed, setting up the frame, and slowly spreading the scattered wheat stalks on the roof.
The northwest wind, fierce, blew over from the vast wilderness in gusts, one gust closely following another. White steam came out of Li Huatang's mouth, and his snot and drool froze into ice on his beard. He kept blowing on his ten fingers, which were all cracked.
This is a plain that has only recently receded from the Yellow River flood, an area scoured by the flood, a piece of yellow mud, with no grass, trees, or villages visible for dozens of miles around. This midsummer, when the Yellow River breached its banks, Li Huatang and his family of three were rescued by a lifeboat to an earthen embankment that had not been washed away, where they lived for two or three months.
A few days ago, Li Huatang, barefoot, walked on the muddy ground next to his residence, which had lost its boundaries, measuring the portion he was entitled to. Then he used an iron shovel to mark the boundaries, and within the boundaries, he sowed wheat seeds, sowing his hope, hoping for a bumper harvest next spring.
He worked, and a hint of innate indomitable smile appeared on his old and wrinkled face. This piece of land was the inheritance of his ancestors. Before the house was washed away, generations of his family had lived here, full of joy and warmth. He had spent a happy childhood here.
Bundle after bundle of wheat straw were placed on the roof of the shed, flattened, and supported again and again. His wife sorted the messy wheat straw, handing him one bundle after another, which he carefully took and spread on the roof.
"If only Da'er (eldest son) was at home!..." the woman suddenly said.
"Why mention him!"
Li Huatang interrupted his wife's sigh, gently and mildly, without any malice. The eldest son had been a soldier for ten years, and although he often sent letters, he had not yet returned home. The woman thought of the eldest son whenever something happened, but Li Huatang did not miss him as much. He felt that he was not old, he wanted to live! He still had the courage to support his family.
No matter what, on the land left by his ancestors, the muddy ground where the house had once stood still had to be rebuilt with a house, even if it was a thatched shed. It was always built by his own hands, and he would be content as long as he could shelter from the wind and rain, and he would feel unspeakable joy.
"Old man, get a fire going!"
The woman handed the flint and tinder to Li Huatang, saying this. He took it and struck a light, then handed it to his wife. The woman ordered her fifteen-year-old son to replace her work, lighting a fire under the makeshift stove.
She poured the soybean cakes that had just been chopped on the embankment from her pocket into the iron pot, and added half a ladle of water. The wind was strong, and the woman squatted on the ground, shivering, her hair disheveled. She had not washed for more than three months. When the fire went out, she knelt by the stove and blew on the unextinguished embers, blowing again and again.
Her eyes were tearing from the wind and smoke. She didn't seem to feel anything, just wiped it off and continued to blow the fire. She lifted the pot lid, and a fragrant soybean aroma rushed into her nostrils. She knew it was almost ready. These soybean cakes used to be used to feed pigs or as fertilizer, but now, they were their only food! And they could only eat it once a day.
After the flood, they didn't have much surplus grain, so they exchanged it for cheap soybean cakes to eat gradually, waiting quietly for the wheat season next spring.
The roof of the shed was finished, and the soybean cakes were cooked. Li Huatang stopped his work and squatted on the ground, eating with his wife and children.
"Dad, why don't you put some salt in the pot?" the little son asked.
"Tsk, silly child!" Li Huatang chuckled, "When I was little, our family often didn't eat salt for two or three months every year!"

Sonnet
Yang Lida

Chen Yuanyuan, courtesy name Guofen, her original family name was Xing, raised in the Chen family, so she adopted the surname Chen. She was Wu Sangui's wife. Wu led the Qing army into the customs and was made Prince of Pingxi. He wanted Yuanyuan to be his official wife, but she declined. Knowing that Wu harbored rebellious intentions, she asked to become a female Taoist. When Wu rebelled, Yuanyuan advised him not to listen, so she followed Zen Master Yulin to Hongjue Temple, shaved her head to become a Buddhist nun, named Jingjing, and styled herself Yü-an. When the Qing army pacified Yunnan, Yuanyuan threw herself into the Lotus Pond and died, buried next to the Shangshan Temple, as recorded in Mr. Yinguo's Compilation of Chen Yuanyuan's Affairs. After I arrived in Yunnan, I lived near the Lotus Pond at Southwest Associated University. I often took walks along the pond with friends, so I used a Shakespearean sonnet to praise Yuanyuan.

Treating the ancient temple as a deep boudoir,
And the sacred altar as a dressing table,
The ancient well is the mirror when you do your morning makeup,
And your slender hands are your comb.
Let loneliness seal up your glorious years,
In the dead of night, you kneel before the gods,
Murmuring the scriptures under the dim lamp;
Hoping that the iron tree will never bloom or bear fruit,
The lonely years melt away like flowing water.
The wind of the plateau takes away your dreams of beauty,
Waking up in the middle of the night, sighing that past events are like dreams.
Far away in the north, there are lonely rabbits running everywhere,
It is hateful that Wu Sangui's heart is dark, without a soul.

Oh, the boat is cold on Wuhua Mountain at night
(In the deep of the clear night, you quietly threw yourself into the water of the Lotus Pond to die).
One inch of mountain and river, one inch of blood.

Ye Jingfeng

Tsurumi rarely spoke, he tried his best to enjoy the warmth given to him by Mrs. Koyuan and Kikuyo. He knew that the more he could receive their supplies, compared to saying some sweet words, the more he could make them feel satisfied.
Because Tsurumi was used to sitting in chairs in China, he automatically moved from the kneeling cushion to the only small soft chair in the corner of the room after eating a bit. This action again provided Mrs. Koyuan and her daughter with a lot of material for jokes. They both maintained this quiet warmth until Tsurumi had enough to drink, and ate a bowl of home-style rice and fish noodles cooked by Mrs. Koyuan herself, which he hadn't eaten for many years. While Tsurumi smoked cigarettes and drank green tea, Mrs. Koyuan and Kikuko asked a question or two while observing his expression:
"Do the Chinese still like to talk so loudly?" ... "Do they still spit everywhere?" ... "Do they still eat several large bowls in one meal, like a rice-eating competition?" ... "Are the officials still so fond of money?" ... "Do the businessmen still cheat people like that?" ... "Are the common people still so afraid of the rice people?" ... "Do they still only take a bath two or three times a year?" , ... "Sneezing at people? ... Coughing in people's faces? ... Yawning at people and still shouting loudly? ... Do tailors still have to shorten the new clothes of customers, leaving cloth behind for their families to make trousers?..."
The attitude of the mother and daughter when asking these questions was mostly joking, entertaining, and fun, not very serious. Tsurumi also dealt with them in an entertaining manner. Finally, Mrs. Koyuan took a vigilant breath and mentioned the war going on at the moment. "Another war with China, I'm afraid my son's brother will have to be drafted again... I don't know why they have to fight? ... Is there no other way to solve the China problem?..."
Tsurumi smiled and said, "If there is no war, how can we soldiers make merit? Without merit, we can't become high officials and hold great power!" He was deliberately teasing.
"Brother Wang," Kikuko softly inserted into the conversation, "War will kill many people. There are fewer people in our country, and several times more Chinese people. Isn't it very uneconomical?"
"China has no weapons. Our weapons are many and good. Isn't it a pity not to use them? ... Besides, with good weapons, the loss of people will be less, won't it?"
"Although the weapons are good, you shouldn't kill people!" Mrs. Koyuan felt that fighting was too cruel. "Your uncle used to say: 'Killing a thousand, harming eight hundred!' This calculation doesn't make sense."
"Even if the calculation doesn't make sense, this is a matter of national importance. I am just a small soldier, and I don't understand it very well!"! Seeing that he was unwilling to continue these annoying questions, he took out the "national affairs" tiger head card to cut off the problem.
"Kikuko" Mrs. Koyuan knew that Tsurumi didn't like to talk about this kind of thing, and didn't want to nag anymore and make Tsurumi annoyed, so she warned Kikuko, "Have you forgotten something?" Kikuko smiled at her mother, nodded again, and said to herself, "Wait a little longer, I'm afraid it will delay Brother Wang's affairs!" As she spoke, she took out a small cloth clip from her sleeve, opened it and took out a small piece of paper, and said to Tsurumi, "Brother, I have been entrusted by someone to keep this piece of paper and publish it to you when possible..." She paused as she spoke, looking at Tsurumi's face.
"It doesn't matter... I have slept enough now, drunk enough, eaten enough, and talked a lot, this is my purpose for coming here. Is there anything? Can you tell me now? ... But I am very grateful to you and my aunt for treating me and sympathizing with me so kindly."

Poetry Record of Returning Home
Lu Baihua

Passing Qingfeng Ridge
Because of the haste of my return, I had to cross the river to the east. It was still very dark, and Zong'en had already hailed two rickshaws, waiting at the entrance of the Qingtai Hotel. It seemed that only the rolling sound of these two carts was pulling towards the river under the still hanging street lights, pulling past the drum tower in the style of a barrier, followed by a long embankment. I was surprised that I had never taken this road before, so desolate, around the embankment, with broken walls and tiles, leaving behind the remains of foxes and rats. The river was also in sight. Because we had to catch the first bus to Cao'e, we had to "cross privately" before the people crossing the river. As the ferry crossed the vast river waves, the faint morning light gradually spread out. Although it was only a few minutes of "ferry" time, it made me feel that crossing the river was the same as boating on the lake, with a kind of pleasure.
Eight years ago, the journey home could be reached in one day, and there were long-distance buses connected by Xiaoshao to meet people at the river crossing. Now, after the destruction of the magic hand, the section from Cao'e to Sanjie cannot be connected. Apart from speculative chartered cars, there are only rickshaws, and rickshaws stopped at Cao'e Station, and there happened to be chartered cars soliciting passengers. Combining seventy thousand yuan, we could leave in ten minutes. But these kinds of cars were too worn out to bear. It was really impossible to drive to Bujiang halfway. There was still half a road from Xiaojiang to Sanjie, so what to do? We wandered outside a gate, staring blankly at the desolate river, when a chartered car came behind us, honking. The person in the car greeted me. It turned out to be the captain of a certain air force team, who had bravely bombed Longhua while flying a plane. Now he was returning home in glory. Coincidentally, we were from the same hometown. This solved the siege. His car was much better, and he chartered it all the way from the riverside to Sheng County. Following the ups and downs of the mountains, the car drove up to the towering cliffs. Below was the stream. The branches of the jungle flew past the car window. I looked up at a towering pavilion on the top of the cliff, knowing that we had reached Qingfeng Ridge.
Qingfeng Ridge and Cao'e River are both ancient sites in eastern Zhejiang, and they have drawn a tragic page of history. However, I thought that Cao'e was a filial daughter, and Qingfeng was a chaste woman, one filial to her father, and the other chaste to her country. It is not easy to be chaste to one's country. She was captured by the Yuan soldiers at the end of the Song Dynasty. Passing over the ridge, knowing the shame, and with the anger and hatred of the country's demise and the family's destruction intertwined with the powerless heart of a weak woman, she dipped her blood and wrote a poem, then jumped off the cliff and died. The last sentence of the poem, "It is sad to both survive and perish!", how much does it contain the decline of the family and the country! And it moves people thousands of years later today.

Night Mooring at Qingfeng Remembering the Pier,
The Ancient Atmosphere Has Not Yet Covered the Respected Shrine;
From Here to Yan Stream, the Mountain Looks Dark
Ten Thousand Trees of Winter Green Protect the Spirit of the Martyr!

Anecdotes of Writers - Ibsen
Gan Si

Ibsen wrote a book "A Doll's House", which spoke out the words that women dared not say in their hearts, and thus became the women's movement at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries. After this book was published, many women went to his residence crying and thanking him, but Ibsen waved his hands and hurriedly said, "No need to thank me, no need to thank me, this is just a script I wrote!"

Byron
Byron's grades at school were very poor. According to the reversed ranking method used at the time, he should have been the first. The teacher often said to him, "George, now I see when you will take first place."

National Capital
Regarding the issue of determining the capital, the debate between Nanjing and Peiping resulted in a victory for those advocating Peiping as the capital by a majority of 117 votes to 63 in the National Assembly's draft constitution review meeting yesterday.
This is just a preliminary stipulation in the draft constitution. It is still uncertain whether it will be passed in the comprehensive review meeting in the future, and whether it can be passed three times in the plenary session.
However, such news is enough to stimulate both Peiping and Nanjing. Everyone think about it, what kind of changes will there be in the real estate in these two places?

Gold Notes
Gold and U.S. dollars are like unfortunate brothers, one moves and everyone moves. A big wave came three or four days ago, and now another wave has come.
Rising, rising, rising, if this trend continues, the days when one U.S. dollar will be exchanged for 10,000 yuan in legal tender will not be too far away. What will happen!
Some people say that because the end of the year is approaching, speculators want to make a fortune. This statement is not necessarily entirely correct. If the financial market is stable, how can speculators create waves?

Winter Relief
Speaker Pan of the Senate came out to loudly appeal. And took the lead in advocating, donating his public funds of 500,000 yuan in the Senate for winter relief.
This is to test our conscience, I hope everyone will generously donate to help the large number of poor and destitute people in this cold weather!

News Data
Sixty-Three-Year-Old Woman Turns into a Man After Death
Zheng Fan

A strange story was published in the newspaper: Mrs. Molly, an old lady from New Zealand who was already sixty-three years old, recently passed away in Duayashire, and suddenly it was discovered that "she" was originally a thorough man. This Mr. Mori not only dressed as a woman all his life, but also married a man. Such news does seem strange and weird to hear, so let's just "listen" to it. What was the motive of this Mr. Mori? The telegram does not provide details, so there is no way to investigate, but there is no doubt that he has a physiological and psychological abnormality. In sexual psychology, this type of sexual perversion of "men dressing as women" and "women dressing as men" is called "eonism."

Not Lacking Precedents
Eon was a noble youth from France in the 18th century, who served in the French diplomatic world during the reign of Louis XV. He finally died in London. In London, everyone thought he was a woman, and it was not until after his death during the autopsy that it was discovered that he was completely male.
In fact, this kind of eonism is a very common perversion, but most people hide this perversion deep in their hearts and do not show it much. Usually, a man's "femininity," twisting and turning when walking, being shy, having a strong sense of vanity, and being sensitive, these phenomena are enough to explain the prevalence of eonism. It is also very common for women to desire to imitate the temperament and attitude of men and like to wear men's clothing.
The more civilized the country, the easier it is to have this kind of thing. Generally speaking, men or women with eonism often act abnormally, almost to the point of madness, men fantasizing about pregnancy, women fantasizing about marrying wives, but in terms of spirit, they often exceed ordinary people and may become outstanding artists, writers, or politicians.

Sexual Perversion
This kind of perverted psychology may be inherited from the father or mother to his children, slightly presenting nervousness, or having a temperament that is out of balance. Significant perversions only account for a very small part of people, so the matter of Mori dressing as a woman all his life is indeed rare.
Sexual psychology perversions can sometimes affect physiology, with perverted places in physiological structure and function; for example, men's nipples are particularly large, women's larynges are particularly developed, or men's voices are sharp and shrill, while women's voices are completely male. In terms of physiology alone, there may also be perversions in both men and women. It is often said in legends that "a woman feels different while sleeping, and wakes up to find she has become a man," or "a man has a serious illness, and after recovering from the illness, he suddenly gradually turns into a woman." However, true and certain things seem to be rarely encountered. In the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, there was a woman from Qing County named Yao Jinping who, because she missed her father so much, fell ill in a small building and fell into a coma. Suddenly, she heard thunder circling above her head, and with a bang, she actually changed her hairpin for a hat in an instant. When she came to Shanghai, she immediately caused a sensation throughout the city, and people from all walks of life flocked to visit her. As a result, doctors from the National Shanghai Medical College forcibly examined her and found that she was still a daughter and had no perversion at all. It is said that because she wanted to go to Xinjiang to find her father, she was afraid that women would have many inconveniences when traveling far away, so she had no choice but to come up with this strange idea. The mystery was revealed, and medical scientists and news reporters wasted a lot of pen and ink, which was truly hilarious.

Possible Things
Of course, true female-to-male and male-to-female transformations are possible. In 1909, Professor Brauer found five discoveries in history. The reason is nothing more than the role of hormones in the adrenal membrane, but the detailed content is still a mystery to this day.
"Purposeful" disguise is often seen. Just last month, there was a young white Russian boy in Qingdao named Filianafu who disguised himself as a dancing girl and actually went to sea to accompany dances. His glamorous name spread far and wide, and he defrauded a lot of U.S. dollars. Later, he was identified by the local military police, and his trick was exposed, and he was arrested and imprisoned. There are many, many other similar incidents, which are not within the scope of this article, so I will not "cite extensively."
I believe that psychologists and medical scientists will give us more accurate and satisfactory answers in the near future.

A Legend Unsolved Mystery

### Wu Suiren Indictment: Embezzlement of 2.7 Billion Constitutes Suspicion of Corruption

[Our Newspaper] Wu Suiren, head of the Cashier Section of the General Affairs Department of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERR), embezzled 2.7 billion yuan. The District Prosecutor's Office concluded its investigation after a month. The handling prosecutor, Liu Yongzhi, believed that Wu Suiren, using his authority over cashier matters, misappropriated public funds for direct personal gain. Although he returned all the embezzled public funds with interest after the incident, it did not help his completed act of direct personal gain. Therefore, he was prosecuted under Article 3, Paragraph 6 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Corruption: "Those who directly or indirectly seek personal gain in matters under their supervision or management shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for not less than seven years." The full text of the indictment is as follows:

Wu Suiren, male, 40 years old, residing at No. 2, Ruifengli, Dongjia Road, North Sichuan Road, serving as the head of the Cashier Section of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.

The above-mentioned defendant is suspected of corruption (Case No. 53250, Zhenjiazi, Year 35). The investigation has been completed, and it is deemed that prosecution is warranted. The facts of the crime, evidence, and the applicable laws are listed as follows:

Wu Suiren has served as the head of the Cashier Section of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for many years, in charge of the ERR's cashier duties, holding significant responsibility for the receipt and expenditure of public funds. The ERR entrusted him with utmost sincerity. However, the defendant was recently

Blinded by Greed, taking advantage of the power and opportunity of his position as the head of the department to seek direct personal gain. On October 22 of this year, the Nanjing Cashier Section of the ERR transferred a sum of 2.7 billion yuan in national currency to the Shanghai Cashier Section of the ERR through the Nanjing Branch of the Central Bank of China, which was noted to be the funding for the Joint Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (JRRA) in September, allocated as an advance payment to the ERR. The national treasury allocated the funds to the Nanjing office, which then transferred them to the recipient bank via the Central Bank. The payee was listed as the Cashier Section of the General Affairs Department of the ERR. On October 24, the remittance arrived at the Shanghai Central Bank. After receiving notification, the defendant went to Shanghai alone the next day (October 25)

Central Bank to Withdraw Funds, with a single signature and voucher. He also had the Central Trust Bureau Trust Department endorse and note "Receive Payee's Account." After the Central Bank exchange officer verified that the procedures were correct, he approved the full amount of the remittance to be delivered in the form of Central Trust Bureau cashier's checks, which the defendant directly received in full. At that time, the details of the exchange and payment were not reported to the ERR's supervisors, nor were the director of the Finance Department or the director of the Accounting Office notified. The defendant dared to secretly transfer this huge sum of money and privately entrusted friends to make loans to seek high profits, as high as 14% or 15%. A portion of the funds, totaling 100 million yuan, was lent out or used by the defendant himself, while 1 billion yuan remained unused. Subsequently, the ERR received a telegram from the Nanjing office informing them that the funds had been remitted and ordering an investigation and report on the receipt of funds. The relevant director interrogated the defendant after investigating the receipt of funds. The defendant knew that the matter was exposed and could not be concealed, so he confessed the process of privately withdrawing public funds for personal gain through loans and promised to

Recover the Principal and Interest and return it to the treasury. The ERR believed that he, as the cashier, had misappropriated public funds for personal gain and should be dismissed from his post and sent to the authorities for investigation according to the law. This office secretly detained the defendant. After several interrogations, the defendant admitted to misappropriating public funds for personal gain and stated that the principal and interest had been fully returned to the ERR. This was verified with the ERR and the Central Bank's replies, confirming that the full amount of 2.7 billion yuan had been recovered in installments: 1.1 billion yuan on October 31, 600 million yuan on November 4, 100 million yuan on November 6, 900 million yuan on November 7, and 14.6 million yuan in interest on November 14. The funds were handed over by Wu Suiren that day in his capacity as the head of the Cashier Section, bearing the seal of Wu Suiren of the Cashier Section. The defendant's claim that he personally withdrew the funds and returned them is credible. In summary, the defendant Wu Suiren, taking advantage of his position and authority, misappropriated public funds for his own direct profit in matters under his management of the cashier’s office.

The Evidence is Clear. Although all the misappropriated public funds, including principal and interest, were returned to the treasury after the incident, this does not affect his completed act of direct personal gain. Therefore, whether the defendant actually profited or not is irrelevant. Based on past judgments and interpretations, the defendant's actions constitute a violation of Article 3, Paragraph 6 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Corruption, without any doubt. Prosecution should be initiated in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

### Municipal Council General Assembly Approaching; Half-Li Section of Road Awaiting Repair

[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council's second general assembly is scheduled to be held at Zhengshi Middle School on Anhe Temple Road on January 6 of next year. However, a bumpy and uneven section of the road leading to the school, about half a li in length and consisting of mud, poses a considerable inconvenience to vehicle traffic. Therefore, a special request has been made to the Municipal Government and the school to negotiate and carry out minor repairs, including applying asphalt. It is now understood that the Municipal Government Standing Committee may be responsible for the labor costs of repairing this section of the road, but it hopes that Zhengshi Middle School can bear the cost of materials. Secretary-General Xiang of the Municipal Council is currently in contact with the authorities regarding this matter.

### Puppet Township Chief of Qingpu County, Zou Baoxian, and Five Others, Massacre Fifteen Lives, Fall Guy Chen Amu Reveals the Truth, Bereaved Family Members Painfully Recount the Ordeal

[Our Newspaper] Zou Shixian, the puppet township chief of Xi'an Township, Qingpu County, who is accused of massacring fifteen lives, along with Xue Shunde, Chen Amu, Yang Ada, and Yu Kesheng, were brought to trial at the High Court yesterday morning. The defendants present were Zou Shixian and Chen Amu; the remaining three defendants, Xue Shunde, Yang Ada, and Yu Kesheng, were absent. Many family members of the victims, including Gu Nianlin and Cui Changxi, supported by the old and leading the young, recounted the details of the massacre in court and distributed a leaflet titled "A Tearful Plea for Justice," signed by plaintiffs Gu Nianlin, Cui Changxi, Hua Youren, Liu Guhong, Meng Er Ma, Gu Nianfu, Jiang Wang Shi, Ji Liu Shi, Liu Zhu Shi, Zhou Xiao Yazi, and others. The leaflet describes the details of the victims’ experience in great detail. When questioned, the defendants denied the charges. The court stated that the case was still under investigation and adjourned the hearing to a later date.

According to the family members of the victims, they were originally from Northern Jiangsu and came to Jiangnan by boat during the period of occupation to make a living. On the sixteenth day of the first month of the lunar calendar last year, their small boat was anchored near the old Zhaihe River in Xiaoyin Township, Xi'an Township, in the fifth district of Qingpu County. The victims, including Huang Gu Shi and sixteen others, agreed to go ashore to collect grass. On the way, they encountered Yang Ada and other local villagers, which led to an argument. The puppet township chief Zou Shixian, puppet Bao chief Xue Shunde, and others then led thirty to forty villagers armed with carrying poles and rakes,

Surrounding and Viciously Beating the Victims. Zhou Liu was beaten to death on the spot. Except for Liu Xiao Erzi, who escaped, the remaining fourteen people were tied up. At night, the puppet township chief Zou Shixian and others, without any humanity, cruelly killed all fourteen members of the Bao Gu Shi family, including men, women, the old and the young. The case was reported to the puppet Qingpu County government on March 3 of last year by the families of the victims. The puppet county magistrate, Huang Liewen, took bribes publicly and allowed the murderers to be released on bail and ordered the families of the victims to sign an agreement, receive 100,000 yuan in puppet currency as compensation, and leave the territory within a specified period. At the time, they were forced by the enemy and puppet forces and had no way to seek redress. Now, the High Procuratorate has filed a public prosecution on charges of treason and murder. They deeply hope that the murderers can be brought to justice as soon as possible so that the wronged souls of the victims can rest in peace in the afterlife.

The defendant Zou Shixian, wearing a long robe, claimed to have worked underground. He alleged that the victims were robbers who were killed in the course of robbery in his jurisdiction, but he did not give the order and claimed to be unaware of the other circumstances. The second defendant, Chen Amu, testified during the previous hearing that he was forty-two years old, but yesterday suddenly claimed to be twenty-six years old. When questioned, he stated that he was indeed twenty-six years old and that the perpetrator of the crime was his cousin, the township chief of Xiaoyin Township, who had ordered him to be a fall guy. At this point, the court stated that the case was complex and required further investigation and adjourned the hearing to a later date.

### Puppet Bao Chief Sun Wenbin Speaks in Full Respect, Addressing the Court as "Your Honor"

[Our Newspaper] Sun Wenbin, the puppet Bao chief of Pingmin Village in Zhabei District, was sued by Yang Jie, a representative of the citizens of the 32nd District, for abusing the power of the enemy and puppets, stealing public property, and oppressing civilians. The High Court held a hearing yesterday afternoon. Those present in court were mostly rural people, and the phrase "Reporting to Your Honor" was constantly heard. First, the accuser Yang Jie described Sun’s crimes while serving as puppet Bao chief, and then the witnesses Bian Jingxin, Ding Laotaipo, Lu Huaicheng, and Yan Kerong were summoned. When questioned, Sun Wenbin denied stealing public property and receiving 150,000 yuan in puppet currency from Ding Laotaipo. The court ordered a postponement of the hearing, and the defendant was remanded in custody.

### Current Residents of Enemy and Puppet Houses Petition for the Preservation of Rental Rights

The second batch of enemy and puppet houses in this city to be auctioned includes twelve units such as No. 181, Fuxiang Lane, Wusong Road, and Minhang Road. The Central Trust Bureau notified the current tenants of each unit to move out within one month after the auction, causing panic among the tenants, who fear being displaced. Therefore, representatives Chen Heng, Zou Qichou, and eight others were publicly elected yesterday and called on Mayor Wu at 11:00 a.m. to request that current tenants' rental rights be preserved after the auction of each unit. The mayor was out on official business, so Secretary-General He met with them on his behalf and expressed sympathy for the difficulty of the tenants in moving out, promising to relay the matter to Mayor Wu and maintain the principle of preserving the rental rights of the original tenants. The representatives were satisfied and are now awaiting a reasonable resolution.

### Reader Consultation, Legal Questions

(1) Illegal Sale of Property

Sun Jiping asks: A, B, and C jointly owned a courtyard house in Hangzhou before the war, which was inherited from their ancestors. Since 1937, the house has been under the care of D (because A, B, and C were away). Two or three years after Hangzhou fell into enemy hands, D, without the consent of A, B, and C, sold the house to Han for 60,000 yuan. Han then sold it to Jin for 120,000 yuan, who in turn sold it to the traitor Yu for more than 300,000 yuan. After the victory, the authorities arrested Jin. It is said that Yu had already fled upon hearing the news. The house is now sealed by the Central Trust Bureau, and it is rumored that there are bids for tens of millions of yuan. B and C have not yet returned to Zhejiang, and A unfortunately died of illness during the war. Now, A's son has returned to Zhejiang from the inland and learned of the above situation after meeting with D. Now, A's son wants to reclaim the property rights.

Are there other similar clauses that can be used for an effective lawsuit? (4) Are there any other important procedures to be followed when recovering the property? Is it practically difficult?

"Lawyer Cao Yaxia Answers" (1) No. (However, if A's son has legally inherited his father A's property, he can claim co-ownership. Or B and C can authorize him to exercise the ownership rights on their behalf.) (2) There is hope. (3) Effective. In addition, Article 758 of the Civil Code stipulates that the acquisition, establishment, and alteration of real property rights through legal acts shall not take effect unless registered. (4) File a lawsuit with the court to confirm that the sale of the land is invalid and submit a statement to the agency managing enemy and puppet property.

(2) Female Party Breaks Engagement

(2) The male party was unable to hold the scheduled wedding with his fiancée due to military service. Now the female party has fled to another place and refuses to fulfill the marriage contract. Is she guilty of obstructing the marriage of a conscript? (3) The female party's family falsely accuses the male party of abandonment. What should be the legal response? (4) If there is proof that the female party is being deliberately hidden by her mother's family to pursue other intentions, can a lawsuit be filed with the court to seek compensation from her mother's family for losses? (5) If the male party is willing to abandon this marriage, can a notice of termination of the marriage contract be published? (6) If the marriage contract is not terminated, can the male party engage or marry another person, or does it constitute bigamy?

"Lawyer Cao Yaxia Answers" (1) It violates Article 972 of the Civil Code, which stipulates that "marriage contracts should be established by the parties themselves," and is naturally invalid; (2) The marriage contract is fundamentally invalid, so there is naturally no violation of the "Regulations on the Protection of the Marriages of Soldiers Conscripted for Resistance against the Enemy"; (3) The charge of abandonment cannot be established; (4) When a marriage contract is terminated, the innocent party may seek compensation from the guilty party for the losses suffered as a result.

### Supply Continues to Dwindle, Demand Continues to Boom, Gold and Banknotes Both Reach New High Prices, Gold Exceeds 3 Million Mark, US Dollar Black Market Rises to 5,700

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, rumors were even more rampant, and buying interest revived, causing prices to rise again. The morning opened at 2.905 million. In the first session, it was inevitably succumbed by pressure and hovered, once retreating to around 2.895 million before stabilizing again. When the 2.90 million mark was broken, people's confidence returned. After 10 a.m., the Central Bank supplied 400 bars at a price of 2.9125 million. Afterwards, sellers gathered again, and speculators echoed, and the Central Bank's supply gradually retreated. Thus, at noon, it jumped to around 2.965 million. In the afternoon, overnight delivery surged even more, finally soaring to around 3.01 million, a sharp increase of 113,000 compared to the previous closing. Gold jewelry hung high at 316,000. Silver bullion and silver dollars remained unchanged. Secret interbank lending was flat, and secret interest rates remained between 12% and 15%.

Foreign Exchange Only Advances, No Retreat. The US dollar started at 5,250 yuan in the morning and continued to climb, reaching around 5,600 yuan at noon. After 5 p.m., it continued to rise to 5,700 yuan, an increase of more than 400 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars were in short supply, and finally soared to over 1,150 yuan, with a wide gap between buying and selling prices, a sharp increase of 110 yuan. Hong Kong exchange had buyers but no sellers, finally closing at 1,100 yuan. Indian exchange was 1,340 yuan, and British exchange was 17,501 yuan. The situation was too chaotic, so the volume of transactions decreased.

Factors Contributing to the Rise of the US Dollar

There are many rumors about the reasons for the rise of the US dollar, and no one can agree on one. This reporter specially visited economic experts. According to them, there are several reasons for the recent rise in the US dollar:

(1) After the promulgation of the new trade control measures, the approval and sale of foreign exchange came to a standstill for a time, and the supply was interrupted, so the US dollar took the opportunity to rise.

(2) Recently, there have been many American ships arriving in Shanghai, and some importers, due to the lack of foreign exchange, have had to seek US dollars to make up for it. The most active purchasers this time are the importers.

(3) The International Bank is about to announce the exchange rates of various countries. It was previously rumored that December would be the key to the final decision on our country's exchange rate, and generally sensitive speculators are taking the opportunity to absorb US dollars and raise prices.

(4) Money from other ports poured into Shanghai, causing the Shanghai financial industry's capital position to loosen. And with the approach of the end of the year, the avenues for consumption are narrow. Seeing the US dollar trending strong, they rushed to buy it, which is also a major reason for stimulating the price increase.

(5) Recently, the Central Bank has not adopted an active policy to suppress gold prices, which has aroused suspicion among the general public, who believe that gold and banknotes have a bright future. Optimists are actively buying in to wait for changes. This is another aspect of speculative psychology, which is enough to promote fluctuations in the price of banknotes.

No Basis for Issuing New Banknotes

Furthermore, it is rumored in the market that the Central Bank is about to issue large-denomination banknotes and that the exchange rate will be adjusted again. This reporter also visited various relevant authorities to inquire about the truth of the rumors.

According to Liang Ping, Director of the Issuance Bureau of the Central Bank, he had not heard of the Central Bank issuing new banknotes with huge denominations, and the Central Bank authorities had not considered such measures. Therefore, this rumor is completely groundless and lacks any factual basis.

Although the rumor of adjusting the exchange rate is spreading more and more, according to the observations of authoritative observers, given the current situation, there seems to be no need to adjust the exchange rate in terms of facts and timing. The government authorities have recently promulgated revised import and export trade measures, and the government's intention to strengthen the control of import trade in order to save our country's foreign exchange resources has been clearly demonstrated. After the implementation of the new trade measures, the past phenomenon of various sectors placing orders abroad, which resulted in a huge outflow of foreign exchange, can gradually be corrected. Since the pressure on foreign exchange resources has eased, there is no need to consider adjusting the exchange rate again. Moreover, based on the last time the exchange rate was adjusted, the general price level followed suit, and the rate of increase even exceeded the rate of adjustment of the exchange rate. As a result, the extent of the harm was even greater than keeping the exchange rate unchanged. Therefore, unless there is a special need, the government will not rashly make such an adjustment that is not worth the risk.

### Government Bonds Remain Stagnant

Government bonds remained stagnant yesterday. Unified C was bought in Room 552, starting at 1,150 yuan in the morning and gradually rising to 230 yuan before stabilizing, an increase of 80 yuan compared to the previous closing. A and B rose by 50 yuan, D fell by 10 yuan, and Unified E remained flat. The transaction volume was over one million yuan.

### Rice Market Continues to Weaken
