### Large Quantities of Military Supplies Transported to Jiamusi; Communist Troops in Harbin Begin to Withdraw; Preparing to Blow Up the Songhua River Bridge

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 15th] The Communist troops in Harbin are preparing to destroy the Songhua River Railway Bridge. For days, they have dispatched forty to fifty small riverboats to drill deep holes, about one foot in diameter, into all sides of the bridge's base using iron drills, filling them with explosives, ready to destroy it at any moment. Furthermore, the Communist troops have been using large carts to transport ammunition and important military supplies to Bin County, ninety miles east of Harbin, the purpose of which is unclear. Within Harbin, the Communist troops have already begun implementing "struggle sessions" and "purges."

[Reuters, Nanjing, 15th] Amidst the National Army's wedge-shaped advance towards Yan'an and Zhangjiakou, the Communist troops in Harbin have also begun withdrawing towards Jiamusi in the Northeast. The Songhua River Railway Bridge is prepared to be blown up, and Jiamusi may become the new headquarters for the Communist Party in the Northeast.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 15th] General Du Yuming has arrived in Guling to report to Chairman Chiang on the situation in the Northeast. Recent reports indicate that the Communist troops in the Northeast are actively preparing for war and are building a large airfield in Xi'anzi (transliteration).

[United Press, Beiping, 15th] A certain officer of the US Army, having completed extensive travels in the areas controlled by both the Nationalist and Communist armies in the Northeast, returned to Beiping today and stated: The Northeast "is indeed a powder keg." Civil war will inevitably re-erupt "before the snow falls," and the climate in the Northeast has already turned cold. The Northeast side believes it is highly significant that Du Yuming, the Commander of the Northeast Security, flew to Guling to report to Chairman Chiang on the war situation in the Northeast at a time when the offensive by the government forces in North China was fierce. Although recent battles in the Northeast have been limited to small, intermittent clashes, both sides have made major troop deployments and redeployed their positions in preparation for a decisive battle. It is predicted that the fighting will erupt on the Songhua bridgehead halfway between Changchun and Harbin. The National Army has repeatedly attempted to rebuild the Songhua River Bridge, but each time construction begins, it is bombarded by the Communist troops across the river. The Communist troops have built fortifications in the areas along the Songhua River and the Lalin River between Harbin to prevent the National Army from advancing. If Harbin is subjected to a direct attack, the Communist troops will not defend it. The Communist troops are indeed transporting large quantities of equipment from Harbin to Jiamusi, a mountainous area 200 miles northeast of Harbin. Harbin is the location of Lin Biao's headquarters and the second largest city in the Northeast. "The situation is unusually quiet and empty." At the same time, along the railway line from Beiping to the Songhua River, Communist guerrillas are preparing to attack this lifeline, the only one through which the government enters the Northeast. The government's defenses along this railway line are inevitably weak due to its vast length, making it vulnerable to attack.

### Communist Troops Increase Forces Around Zhangjiakou; National Army Advances in Wedge Shape; Conquered Jining Army Advances Rapidly Southward

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] According to related sources, the Communist troops are continuously reinforcing their forces around Zhangjiakou. The war in eastern Hebei is nearing its end, and they are wary. Therefore, they have been reinforcing their forces along the Hebei-Chahar border by as many as 8,000 troops in recent days and destroying bridges and highways between Kangzhuang and the fork in the road. They are building fortifications and engaging in small skirmishes from time to time, striving to gain the initiative. Since the 13th, they have launched a fierce attack on Changping, engaging in fierce fighting five li from Jucheng. Yesterday afternoon, they were still fighting with the defending troops.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] It is reported that the siege of Datong will soon be lifted. The defending troops inside the city are awaiting orders to attack. After the National Army conquered Jining, it continued southward along the railway line and is joining forces with the eastern and southeastern routes, advancing rapidly towards Zhangjiakou. Also, according to a New China News Agency dispatch from the Suidong front line on the 14th, the National Army admitted to capturing Jining on the 14th.

[Our Newspaper, Gui Sui, 14th (Urgent Telegram)] After the National Army completely recovered Jining, eleven brigades of Communist troops were defeated and retreated towards Xinghe Town. The National Army's battle results have not yet been fully investigated.

[United Press, Nanjing, 15th] The National Army is conducting a wedge-shaped offensive between Yan'an and Zhangjiakou, hoping to achieve the effect of separately breaking through. Military observers are paying attention to Hu Zongnan's army advancing northward from Xi'an towards Taiyuan, which will penetrate deep between Yan'an and Zhangjiakou, cutting off the communication between the Red Capital and the Northeast. According to the latest news, strong units of the National Army have reached Linfen, east of Yan'an. The government army's attack on Zhangjiakou will make the communication line between Chahar and the Communist troops in the nine northeastern provinces precarious.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] Yin Hanchu, the representative of the government in the Jining group; Dou Kuisi, the American representative; Zhang Hanshi, the Communist representative; and others from the group took a special plane of the Military Mediation Department back to Beiping last night. U.S. team member Lieutenant Clark had a piece of shrapnel graze his right foot, which has now healed. According to the government representative, the National Army, which recovered Jining, is advancing towards Fengzhen. There is no new progress on the Liangcheng front. The fighting for Jining was not too intense, and the damage inside the city was not severe. However, when the Communist troops retreated, they captured many of the city's able-bodied men. According to related sources here, the Communist troops may use the main force in northern Shanxi and eastern Suiyuan to defend to the death in Fengzhen to prevent the National Army from advancing eastward.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] There is no major change in the military situation in eastern Hebei today. Sun Zhenbang, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Hebei Province, is directing the work of demobilization, training the people, and using military force to repair roads in eastern Hebei in Tangshan. Everything is being actively promoted. The main force of the Communist troops in eastern Hebei is now concentrated in Panshan, west of Zunhua, north of Jixian, and east of Beiping. There are many temples and more than 2,000 caves in the mountain, which can all be used to garrison troops, making it difficult to attack. Most of the Great Wall line has been recovered by the National Army, with only Lengkou and Jielingkou still occupied by the Communist troops. The Xingyong area north of the Great Wall is also still the location of the main force of the Communist troops in Rehe Province. The puppet chairman of the Chinese Communist Party in Rehe Province and several factories are located there.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] The Pinggu Line (currently only open to Miyun) was previously damaged in the Shunyi area. The railway bureau ordered workers to rush repairs, and the entire line will be open to traffic within a month.

### Communist Troops' Instructions Expose Corruption and Misconduct

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 15th] According to a "Bohai Military Region Instruction" of the Communist troops obtained by the military, it is sufficient to prove that the Communist troops are corrupt and exploit the people. They are already unable to conceal this feeling within their ranks. The "Instruction" initially states, "Since the Great March, the mobility of the troops has been great, and the work has deviated from the norm." (The parentheses are quoted from the original sentence, as is done below.) It then lists the facts, saying: "All units are borrowing and eating indiscriminately everywhere, storing and releasing captured items haphazardly, and engaging in guerrilla warfare randomly, resulting in extreme disorder." "Troop production was once handed over to the government, and individual production personnel took this opportunity to fish in troubled waters, becoming corrupt, doing things wildly, causing waste of public finances and suffering enormous losses." In recent months, individual agencies and troops have still taken care of themselves, disregarding the whole, using things for their own purposes, disrespecting government laws and regulations, falsely reporting more, ambushing (the meaning of this sentence is unclear), and making empty plans for production, failing to solve practical problems, and relying on superiors and the government," and so on.

### Yan'an Enlists Militia

[Reuters, Tianjin, 15th] Military sources here revealed that the Joint Defense Headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party in Yan'an has begun to enlist a militia on a large scale. Each city north of Yan'an has a prescribed number of recruits, such as 1,800 in Suide, 1,500 in Mizhi, 2,000 in Jia County, and 1,500 in Qingjian, who are being trained locally. The Communist troops in northern Shanxi have also requisitioned horses, mules, oxen, and donkeys to organize transportation teams.

### Communist Troops Occupy Belgian Church Property; Many Missionaries Flee from Shaanxi

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] It is reported that the churches and church property of Belgium in the Sanbian area of Shaanxi have been confiscated due to the occupation of the area by the Communist troops. Furthermore, the Belgian and Chinese missionaries in the area have been unable to endure the extortion and oppression of the Communist Party and have mostly fled to other areas. Two have fled to Hengshan in Shaanxi, seven have fled to Sanshenggong in Dengkou, and five are currently being detained by the Communist troops. Our government is extremely concerned about this incident. In addition to the Shaanxi Provincial Government sending personnel to Hengshan to rescue the two, it is also sending personnel to investigate and rescue missionaries who have fled to other areas and allocating funds to provide relief.

### Xushang Section of Longhai Railway Begins Selling Tickets and Opening to Traffic

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 15th] After the Xubian section of the Longhai Railway was damaged by the Communist troops, the railway bureau actively rushed to repair it. The Xushang section has started selling tickets and opening to traffic on the 15th. The section between Shangqiu and Kaifeng is still under repair.

### Heavy Artillery for Jiangyin Fortress to Be Transported from Taiwan

[Our Newspaper, Jiangyin, 15th] The director of the fortress has been sent to Taiwan to retrieve the heavy artillery, which is expected to arrive by ship soon.

### National Army in Shandong Advances from Yanzhou; Fierce Fighting Near Jining; Various Refugee Repatriation Groups Work Together

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 15th] The situation in Shandong Province has ensured the security of government strongholds due to the strengthening of the National Army's self-defense capabilities and the close cooperation between the party, government, military, and civilians. Furthermore, the recovery of several counties in southwestern Shandong has enhanced the stability of the people's hearts. A certain strong unit of our army advanced towards Jining from Yanzhou on the evening of the 14th to restore traffic between Yanzhou and Jining, support the National Army advancing northward to recover western Shandong, and assist refugees in returning to their hometowns. It is cooperating with local security forces and refugee repatriation groups from various counties. It is reported that they arrived near Jining early in the morning on the 15th and are engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist troops. The Communist troops in Shandong originally numbered more than 335,000. In addition to those transferred to northern Jiangsu, approximately 267,000 remain in Shandong Province. Approximately 50,000 to 60,000 are near Jinan, and more are distributed along the Jiaoji Railway Line. Judging by their actions, they are paying special attention to maintaining the transportation routes from Jiaodong through the Jiaoji Railway Line (near Caijiazhuang, east of Fangzi) to Linyi in southern Shandong, as this area is the corridor for the Communist troops from the Liaodong Peninsula to northern Jiangsu. The National Army's self-defense capabilities on the Jiaoji Railway Line are also extremely strong. It is widely believed that the goal of opening the entire Jiaoji Railway Line to traffic can be achieved. The Zibo coal mining area is Jinan's lifeline for fuel. Since the National Army recovered it, the Communist troops have deployed the main forces of their Qian Jun and Liao Rongbiao divisions in the vicinity, attacking the mining area from time to time, but have not succeeded. At present, the entire territory of Shandong is generally calm, but the Communist troops are recruiting soldiers and forming teams in various counties, indicating preparations for war. Furthermore, if the Communist troops suffer setbacks in northern Jiangsu, they will inevitably retreat into Shandong. Therefore, the National Army's self-defense work in Shandong will be very arduous in the future. It is reported that there are currently less than 10,000 Communist troops near Linyi. The 131st Brigade of the New Fourth Army has been moved to the Sipo area northeast of Hanzhuang to prevent the National Army from advancing northward. The Communist troops of the Bohai Military Region have recently been transporting large quantities of wheat to the Taihang Mountains from Dezhou, Pingyuan, Yucheng, and other counties in northern Shandong.

### Qingdao Coal Shortage Resolved; Over 9,000 Tons Shipped from Taiwan

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 15th] The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Zhongdong coal transport ship has transported 9,700 tons of industrial coal from Keelung, Taiwan, which can temporarily solve the city's coal shortage.

### Communist Troops Form Assassination Squad

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 15th] The New Fourth Army's Chen Yi unit of the Communist troops has now formed an assassination squad, selecting and training elite cadres, approximately 200 in number, to specialize in infiltrating the National Army and carrying out assassinations.

### US Marines in Tangshan Considering Withdrawal; General Rockey Scheduled to Leave China

[Reuters, Tianjin, 15th] According to informal and reliable sources, the withdrawal of the US Marines from Tangshan is under consideration. The families of European employees of the Kailuan Coal Mine Bureau there are also reportedly preparing to evacuate. Hospitals in the area have been receiving civilians victimized in the fighting along the Beining Railway Line. The Communist troops recently destroyed the Linxi (transliteration) power plant and attacked the American troops escorting coal trains. Therefore, the National Army in the Tangshan area has been increased to two divisions. Furthermore, General Mu Tingfang, the commander of the 94th Army, arrived here from Tangshan on the 15th.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] Lieutenant General Rockey, the commander of the US Marine Corps stationed in Tianjin, is currently handing over his duties and is scheduled to leave China for San Francisco on the 20th to take up his new position as the head of the US Marine Corps Pacific Division.

[Another dispatch] The families of several American officers from the Military Mediation Department and various groups will arrive in Dagu from the United States on the 16th. The Lishi Society has prepared many residences.

### Youth League Cadres and Supervisors Leave Guling

[Central News Agency, Guling, 15th] The personnel of the secretariat of the Second National Congress of the Youth League, led by Ni Wenya, left Guling and returned to Nanjing on the 15th. The Second Central Cadre Supervisory Committee also went down the mountain at the same time.

### American Newspaper Reveals Yan'an's Strategy; Demanding a Ceasefire Is Actually a Trick

[United Press, New York, 15th] Today's "New York Times" editorial stated: "A series of military victories won by the Nationalist government forces led by Chairman Chiang have greatly reduced the Communist Party's desire to continue the civil war, and now they want to achieve a truce through General Marshall. However, Marshall remembers his past failures and the Communist Party's stubborn attitude in previous negotiations and seems unwilling to take action. If Chairman Chiang's victories can continue to progress, it may cause the Communist Party to participate in the National Assembly and restore an uneasy and temporary truce. Yan'an is engaged in political warfare, striving to publicize and exaggerate the Communist Party's significant and dubious victories in the Northeast, but recently Yan'an has shown a willingness to negotiate. The Communist Party, as in the past, seems ready to stop fighting temporarily, engage in negotiations, but even if some definite results are obtained in these negotiations, it is still very likely to be another tactical retreat. Based on past experience, this retreat may still be a trick of the Communist Party to gain a respite and use this opportunity to launch another political war on a larger scale."

### Chen Cheng Arrives in Beiping from Zhengzhou to Inspect Northern Military Affairs

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, accompanied by Director Xu and Deputy Director Wu, flew to Beiping from Zhengzhou this afternoon to inspect northern military affairs. The heads of various military and political departments here went to the airport to welcome him. At noon, Director Li of the Executive Yuan held a banquet to welcome him, and then they went to the Diplomatic Building to rest. At 4:00 PM, they went to the summer camp in the western suburbs to give a speech to the graduating students.

### Beiping Summer Camp Graduates; Chen Cheng Gives Sincere Instructions

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng attended the graduation ceremony of the Beiping Youth League Summer Camp at 4:00 PM this afternoon and gave a speech, discussing the current situation and stating: The government earnestly hopes to resolve the political situation peacefully and strives to avoid fighting. If it is really impossible and forced to fight, that would be the worst policy. The downsizing of the army should still be carried out according to the original plan, that is, the government will maintain 90 divisions and the Chinese Communist Party will maintain 18 divisions. Speaking of the hardships of the youth, Chen denounced corrupt behavior indignantly, but said: Senior government leaders, such as the heads of the five Yuans, will never be corrupt, and ministers such as Wang Shijie and Yu Dawei live very frugally. Chen Cheng also said, "If I am corrupt, you should consider me an enemy." Chen requested that members of the Youth League actively support the government and grasp the revolutionary spirit. Chen said: "The issue of the affiliation of the Youth League will not change. However, in order to reorganize the league's affairs, a League Affairs Reorganization Committee will be established to decide all future reforms. Unemployed youth league members in Beiping will also be established a continuing education class, similar to Nanjing, to accommodate them."

### Zeng Qi Speaks in Changchun; Clarifies the Overall Situation; Adopts Constitution and Establishes Democracy

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 15th] Youth Party Chairman Zeng Qi said on the morning of the 14th: "The most important thing today is the realization of democratic politics, and democratic politics depends on the majority. All problems can be decided in Congress or by national referendum. This is truly an important plan to clarify the current situation. Therefore, what we should strive for at present is the formulation of a constitution so that democratic politics can be established." Zeng also stated that he had often resided in the Shenyang area during the years of the Republic (17, 18, 19), and that this trip to Changchun was his first. Zeng, through Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng, told reporters: "If you don't go to the Northeast, you don't know how big China is. If you don't go to the Northeast, you don't know how dangerous China is."

### Hong Kong Government's Statement on Jurisdiction in Kowloon Walled City Does Not Conform to Regulations

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 14th] A spokesman for the Hong Kong government issued a statement denying that the Kowloon Walled City is still Chinese territory and that China currently exercises jurisdiction there. It is claimed that the 1898 Beijing Treaty agreed to establish a 99-year lease of the New Territories, delineating the British leased territory with the Shenzhen River to the Maggot Bay border. The lease did not state that the Kowloon Walled City was not included. The treaty stipulated that the Chinese officials stationed in the Kowloon Walled City at that time could continue to exercise administration provided it did not hinder British military needs, but by 1899, the Chinese officials' administration in the Kowloon Walled City had conflicted with British military needs and should be terminated. For fifty years, the British authorities have exercised jurisdiction in the Kowloon Walled City, just as in the Kowloon New Territories area. According to the 1898 Contract for the Extension of the British New Leased Territory in Hong Kong, which states that "Chinese officials stationed in the Kowloon Walled City can still perform their duties," the Hong Kong side's unilateral statement this time clearly does not conform to the contract regulations.

### Isoya and Tani Hisao to Be Escorted to the Capital for Public Trial

### Mei Ni Does Not Repent Until Death; His Letter Praises the Actions of Various Traitors

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] After Mei Siping was executed on the 14th, he was placed in a coffin and funeral arrangements were made at the China Funeral Home, with his two younger brothers taking care of everything. It rained all day on the 15th, and there were not many mourners. In addition to the coffin, memorial tablet, and wreaths, there were also seven monks wearing red kasayas in the hall, chanting constantly. It is reported that Mei Ni's letters to Minister Xie and Chairman Shang were absurd, praising the actions of the surviving traitors and pleading for amnesty for them.

### Foreign Minister Wang Returns to the Capital; Says He Is Satisfied with the Performance at the Peace Conference; Allied Nations Value Our War of Resistance

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie flew back to Nanjing from Kunming at 4:15 PM on the 15th. Wang left China eight weeks ago to attend the European Peace Conference and returned home early at the request of the Chairman. Accompanying him were external secretaries Zhou Shukai and others. In addition to Vice Minister Gan Naiguang and the heads of various departments, those who welcomed him at the airport included French Ambassador Meyrier, Australian Minister Copland, British Embassy Counselor Waley, US Embassy Counselor Walter White (White representing Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart), Vice Minister of Propaganda Xu Xiaoyan, Vice Minister of Education Hang Liwu, Luo Jialun, etc., and their wives. Wang was wearing a gray suit, holding a white straw hat, and looked energetic. He smiled as he got off the plane and shook hands with each of the greeters. French Ambassador Meyrier was the first to step forward and asked, "Did you enjoy Paris?" Wang replied, "Very much." Then Walter White immediately conveyed the greetings of Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart to Wang. Wang also answered several questions from reporters at the airport as follows: Q: What was your impression of France when you were in Paris? A: I am very grateful for the thoughtful hospitality of the French authorities. Q: The relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is confusing. What is Foreign Minister Wang's opinion? A: I believe that the United States and the Soviet Union will eventually cooperate. Q: What is the general situation of this peace conference? A: This peace treaty is fairer than the last peace treaty, such as the declaration by Britain and the United States not to demand reparations from the defeated countries, which is one example. Then Wang drove back to his residence. After resting briefly, he went to Secretary-General Wu's office to chat. Wang then met with reporters at his residence and said of his views on the peace conference: At this peace conference, I advocated that the treatment of military issues should be stricter in principle, and the treatment of political and economic issues should be more lenient. As for the issue of colonies, I advocated that they should not be regarded as spoils of war by any victorious country. The performance of the peace conference is not very different from our country's proposals and ideals, which is still satisfactory. As for the process of this peace conference, he said: The peace conference should be able to achieve results in a month. It is not yet possible to confirm what the results will be. Although there are disputes over the Five-Power Treaty, it can definitely be signed. Regarding the issue of reparations in the treaty, Britain and the United States have declared that they will give up. I also never mentioned the issue of compensation at the peace conference. After the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, Italy, although not suffering losses, also demanded compensation. In this war, the damage suffered by overseas Chinese in Italy was very great, but I did not want to raise the issue of compensation in order to enable the democratic and free people of Italy to come to the fore and not to allow the remaining Fascists to use the harsh conditions as an excuse to make a comeback. The above are all examples of the fairness of this peace treaty. Regarding the Italian issue, Wang also said: The main issue lies in the treatment of the colonies. If Libya can achieve independence, or achieve independence within a certain period of time under the trusteeship of the United Nations, and China's proposal can be realized, then this peace conference will be more successful than the last one. Also, it was reported that Foreign Minister Wang will hold a press conference within days to report on the process of attending the peace conference.

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 14th] Provincial Chairman Lu Han hosted a banquet on the evening of the 14th to welcome Foreign Minister Wang. During the banquet, Wang said: (1) The Paris Peace Conference will definitely have results in a month. The future of the international situation is not as dangerous as rumored. However, whether the major powers can fully cooperate depends on whether a satisfactory solution to the German issue can be found. (2) The Allied nations attach great importance to China's past contributions to the War of Resistance and its future development. We must work hard to find domestic unity and peace. The work of China's revival must not be delayed any longer.

### Special Envoy Marshall's Audience with the Chairman: First Extended Conversation After Eight Ascents to Lushan; British Newspaper Praises Special Envoy's Proposal

[Central News Agency, Guling, 15th] Special Envoy Marshall went to the Chairman's residence at 5 p.m. on the 15th for an audience, the first meeting after eight ascents to Guling. The meeting lasted a considerable time.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The 15th was another regular Sunday holiday, and everyone is waiting to see what happens after Special Envoy Marshall returns to Nanjing. There is still no confirmation as to whether Special Envoy Marshall will return to Nanjing on the 16th. On the morning of the 15th, Special Envoy Marshall made a long-distance call from Guling to his aide, Colonel Ke Yi. Colonel Ke Yi happened to be visiting Ambassador Stuart at 9 a.m. and was unable to take the call. Ke Yi and Stuart talked for an hour before leaving. It is reported that Jing Bo visited Zhou Enlai at 12 p.m. but did not meet him, only talking with Wang Bingnan for about half an hour. It is said that Fu is still trying to persuade the Communist Party to participate in an informal five-person group meeting, hoping to start with political issues. The Communist Party said that Fu's visit was a normal courtesy call and did not involve anything else, because the Communist Party has firmly rejected the five-person group meeting. In the afternoon, the ambassador went to church for worship and had no other activities.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Zhang Li-sheng told reporters on the 15th that we are still expecting the Communist Party to participate in the informal five-person group meeting, because when the proposal for the meeting was put forward in August, the Communist Party had expressed its agreement.

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 15th] Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, formally submitted a written application to Special Envoy Marshall's residence today, requesting the reopening of the military three-person group meeting.

[Central News Agency, London, 14th] The Yorkshire Post published a commentary on the 14th, saying that Stuart's proposal to form a five-person group is "a good policy for China." It also said: "A glimmer of hope has now been discovered, which may eventually produce practical results." The newspaper believes that the special envoy can lead the group to success, and the favorable conditions it cited are as follows: (1) The superior government forces have recently caused the rapid retreat of the Communist forces; (2) The people fear war and have more tools to express their wishes than before. The newspaper concluded: "The Kuomintang must understand the power of public opinion. The people are happy to accept the Kuomintang's advice and its experience in cooperating with other political parties. The Communists must reflect on themselves. They can participate in the government and engage in internal reform to serve the peasants, instead of insisting on insurrectionary means, which will damage the country, obstruct transportation, and strike at commercial and economic development."

### Our New Fleet Ordered to Qingdao

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The new fleet docked at Xiaguan has been ordered to Qingdao. The flagship Taikang and six other ships, including Yongsheng, will sail to Shanghai on the 18th to join the Taiping and Yongxing ships and head north.

### Hai'an Situation Stabilized; Communist Troops in Xinghua and Dongtai Hastily Build Fortifications

[Our Newspaper, Taixian, 15th] Hai'an news: The Communist army's attempt to capture Hai'an has been completely crushed. The situation in Hai'an is now unusually stable, with only sporadic battles on the periphery.

[Our Newspaper, Taixian, 15th] It is learned that the Communist army is currently actively building air defense fortifications in the Xinghua and Dongtai areas, with the aim of avoiding the threat of government air force to its cadres and troops.

[Our Newspaper, Taixian, 15th] A person from Zhangdian said: "The Communist army slaughtered many innocent people when they invaded Zhangdian this time, totaling about a hundred people, most of whom were township and village chiefs."

[Our Newspaper, Taixian, 15th] The Communist army is forcibly conscripting young men in the Dongtai area, who are used as the first line in combat. The second line is children, the third line is militia, the fourth line is the Communist army's infantry, the fifth line is machine gunners, and the last is artillery. This method of using the people as cannon fodder has caused great panic among the residents in the bandit areas, and more and more people are fleeing across the river with their families.

[Our Newspaper, Jiangyin, 15th] Jingjiang news: The garrison and self-defense forces searched Zhengdongwei in the western district the night before last and opened fire with the remnants of the Communist army in front of Siweigang, capturing more than a hundred shi of public grain from the Communist side and returning safely. Also, County Magistrate Yang of Nantong recently led a team to inspect the eastern countryside to appease the people and encountered a battle with the Communist army in a hotel. They were defeated and returned to the city safely after three days. The Baipu to Rugao section of the Tongru Highway will be repaired and open to traffic within days.

### United States to Adjust Far East Policy: Seeking to Prevent the Spread of Communist Threats; Truman's Attitude Towards the Soviet Union Awaits Clarification

[United Press, Washington, 14th] Government officials said that the increasingly tense relations between the United States and the Soviet Union may prompt the United States to readjust its Far East policy. The most immediate consequence will be the United States' aid to the Chinese National Government with power and materials to deal with the spread of Communist threats in the Far East. The source emphasized that no decision has been made yet, and no decision will be made until Truman's contradictory attitude towards the Soviet Union is clarified. Some actions taken by the United States in the Far East recently have been interpreted by observers as being caused by the increasingly fractured relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union in other regions. When the United States cannot obtain Soviet cooperation in unifying Korea, it is determined to proceed with the development of the political and economic work of southern Korea on its own, and the transaction of 800 million yuan of surplus materials between the United States and the Chinese National Government is a clear indication of this trend. However, government officials who decide policies stated that this statement is not correct. They claimed that the United States' actions in Korea, like its actions in other parts of the Far East, are motivated by the fact that these actions are the most effective way to solve local problems, and they deny that there has been any change in the United States' policy in Korea. However, in any case, people here have practically given up hope for the success of Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart's mediation of the Chinese Civil War. The general opinion is that the Chinese Civil War will continue for some time, and it is felt that the United States, whether it wants to or not, will be forced to support Chairman Chiang with materials and advice. The responsible source pointed out: The United States cannot meet ideal standards for the governments of other regions, but if its opponent is a Communist, it will resolutely support the government. If the United States decides to readjust its policy toward China, the first result will be to immediately allocate the 500 million yuan loan already designated for the Export-Import Bank of China, because the applications for loans from other countries must be decided before the end of the year, so a decision must be made on the loan to China, so that if China cannot obtain it, it can be allocated to other countries.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 15th] Today's editorial in Pravda accused the US military presence in China as the source of China's misfortune. It said: "The stationing of this army can only contribute to the misfortune of the Chinese people, and the US material aid to the Chinese government army is another example of the US intervention policy. This move is completely contrary to the decisions made at the Foreign Ministers Conference."

### Qian Gonglai Talks to Reporters About the Takeover Work in the Northeast; Besides Materials and People's Hearts, We Should Also Take Over Tears

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 15th] Qian Gonglai, the head of the Northeast Region Takeover and Investigation Team, and his party of ten took a car to Yongji at 1 p.m. on the 14th for inspection. A reporter from the Central News Agency accompanied them. Before the trip, Chief Qian met with the Central News Agency reporter alone and talked about the situation of the takeover work in the Northeast. Qian told the reporter with extremely excited words: "Some people say that the takeover is not about materials, but about people's hearts. In fact, in addition to materials and people's hearts, we should also take over tears." Under the enemy's pressure and coercion, the Northeast has been built up over the past fourteen years. However, many of these constructions have been promoted by the blood, sweat, technology, and tears of our Northeast compatriots. Now that the country is restored, the government should focus on giving full play to the experience and technology that our Northeast compatriots have exchanged with blood and tears. All technical talents who have worked in the production and technical departments of various institutions, such as mines, electrical chemistry, hygiene, medicine, etc., should be put to good use and not be ignored, because the work of rejuvenation really depends on them. The government has not yet announced it. Those who have served as officials in the puppet Manchukuo government will not be allowed to serve in existing agencies under any circumstances. Qian believes that there must be clear regulations on this, because recently, several letters of this nature have been received in the secret mailbox. Qian concretely stated that those who served in the puppet Manchukuo era and were directly involved in the work of conscription, investigation, and distribution, and who are suspected of disturbing and harming the people, should be avoided from being hired. Those who have reformed and are seeking a new life cannot be appointed as supervisors, but can only be given lower positions so that they cannot arbitrarily make claims and cause trouble to the people again. As for those who have been engaged in investigative work in the past, they cannot be allowed to continue to engage in work of the same nature, so as not to hurt the hearts of the people."

### Zhejiang Province's Takeover of Materials; Many Are Bound to Be Concealed; Zhong Pusheng Reports at the Zhejiang Provincial Assembly

[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 15th] Zhong Pusheng, director of the Zhejiang Office of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Processing Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regions, reported to the Zhejiang Provincial Assembly that the estimated value of various takeover materials in Zhejiang is: about 2 billion for materials, 1.3 billion for enemy and puppet properties, 1.4 billion for factories, and more than 70 million yuan in cash. In addition, there are about 2 billion in Ningbo and Jiaxing. However, most of the enemy and puppet materials in Ningbo were taken over by the navy, and the takeover investigation team will go to Qingzha in the cold storage in Dinghai. Zhong also said that the value of the remaining materials handed over by various parties has reached 2 billion yuan. Based on this, it can be inferred that there must still be many materials concealed in various places.

### Military Supplies Department Takes Over Non-Military Supplies; The Investigation Team is Ordered to Make a List and Hand It Over

The team ordered it to make a list and hand it over to the Enemy and Puppet Industry Processing Bureau.

### People from All Walks of Life in Shandong Province Telegraph the United States to Oppose the Transfer of Materials

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 15th] The matter of the United Nations transferring steel rails to Yugoslavia that were originally intended for China has aroused unanimous indignation from all walks of life in Shandong. On the 14th, more than 100 units, including fellow villagers' associations from various counties in Jinan, held a joint meeting and decided to send a telegram to President Truman and American celebrities to uphold justice and transport all the relief materials to China. The meeting also noted that with the approach of winter, millions of refugees in Shandong are suffering from hunger and cold. The central government has allocated 1 billion yuan for emergency relief, which is a drop in the bucket. In addition to sending a telegram to Gu Zhenggang to express gratitude and request more relief funds, it was also requested that the central government increase the amount of funds to save the refugees from suffering, and requested that the Shandong and Qingdao Relief Divisions quickly raise winter clothing for the refugees.

### United Nations Railway Materials to Be Shipped from England to China Next Month

[Central News Agency, London, 14th] It was learned here today that a large number of railway bridge materials, under the auspices of the United Nations, will be shipped from England to China to solve China's serious railway transportation problems. The materials to be transported include 904 complete bridges, weighing 42,000 tons and valued at 2 million pounds, which will be dismantled and shipped for use in Shanghai and Guangzhou, where they will be assembled by engineers. These materials will be shipped as soon as the United Nations cancels the order to stop shipping materials to China issued in July, and are expected to arrive in China in October.

### The Authorities Have Drafted Measures for the Management of Civil Aviation Operations; Civil Aviation Companies Must Meet Standards for Registration

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Regarding the registration and management of civil aviation operations, the relevant authorities drafted a measure in May of this year and are now submitting it to the Executive Yuan for approval. According to the draft, civil aviation companies must first have the necessary conditions in terms of aviation equipment and personnel in order to be approved for registration. Their fares and operations must also meet the regulations. Those that do not meet the standards will naturally not be approved. In the future, the registration and management of civil aviation companies will be based on this measure. At the same time, the establishment of civil aviation companies must also be after the law is passed. It is rumored that a certain civil aviation company has suffered heavy losses because it cannot operate publicly. According to relevant parties, the company's license was revoked, and the situation is not as simple as rumored. It cannot be concluded from this that the government does not intend to support private civil aviation operations. As for the losses suffered by the company as a result, the company itself should be responsible. It is heard that the company's organization is extremely large and seems to be very extravagant, while in terms of equipment, etc., it does not meet the standards. At most, there were only five aircraft, which were later transferred to another company. If the company "defects" to Hong Kong, the government will naturally treat it as a foreign company. However, the Sino-British Aviation Agreement has not yet been drafted, and it may be difficult for the company's aircraft to stay in Shanghai for a short period of time.

### Lu Shizeng, President of the Yunnan High Court, Is Accused of Illegal Conduct

[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 14th] Lu Zhusheng, a merchant from Zhejiang Province, accused Lu Shizeng, president of the Yunnan High Court, of interfering in lawsuits and shielding criminal cases. After learning about this, the People's Freedom Protection Committee stated that the judiciary in Yunnan Province has been dark for several years, and the people have been exploited and trampled on, with no way to appeal. The President of the High Court, Lu, is biased and dare not enforce the law. Recently, it has become even worse, and the President of the Court himself has also committed dereliction of duty and illegal acts. If this continues, the people will be unable to bear it. In order to completely eradicate corruption and alleviate the people's suffering, the association has telegraphed the central government, requesting a strict meeting to deal with all kinds of dereliction of duty and illegal acts of the President of the Court.

### National Judicial Administration Conference Scheduled for January Next Year; Minister Xie Arrives in Suzhou Yesterday for Inspection

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 15th] Xie Guansheng, Minister of Judicial Administration, and Counselor Ni Zheng, arrived in Suzhou from Shanghai by a special train at 10:07 a.m. on the 15th. Sun, President of the Local High Court, Han, Chief Prosecutor, Zai, President of the District Court, Guan, Chief Prosecutor, and more than 30 other people from the judiciary in the local area welcomed them at the station. After Minister Xie got off the train, he took a car directly to the office of the President of the Suzhou High Court for a rest and met with reporters from various newspapers to answer questions and elaborate on the issue of the families of the Chinese traitors detained throughout Jiangsu Province requesting that the cases of the traitors be included in the amnesty. This can only be approved after the Legislative Yuan has passed it. As for the amnesty regulations that have already been stipulated, the Chinese traitors are not included in them. The reason why it has not been promulgated so late is because it has been ordered by the Chairman to postpone the matter. He then mentioned the issue of judicial personnel avoiding their native places. The newly dispatched personnel have already implemented it, and the originally appointed personnel are being adjusted one after another. Finally, he informed reporters that the National Judicial Administration Conference will be held in January next year. Xie inspected the detention center of the High Court at 11 a.m. and paid special attention to the health of the detainees. At 12 noon, he inspected the District Court and the detention center. Seeing that the prison was narrow, he personally instructed President Wang to use the open space in the back to add a prison. At 2:30 p.m., he visited the Third Prison and praised the completeness of the equipment. In the evening, he stayed at the residence of a local gentry, Mr. Xu. He will attend the anniversary week of the High Court at 16 a.m. and give a speech. He will take a special train back to Shanghai and then to Hangzhou at 4 p.m.

### 南昌 News

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Fang Canglang

The seven-member Nanchang Visiting Group of reporters stationed in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Wuhan have arrived in Nanchang for five days. They have been visiting various provincial government agencies and legal entities. They have attended four public banquets hosted by the party, government, military, and Nanchang business associations. In the next two days, they will continue to visit Zhongzheng University and various schools in the urban area.

People of Jiangxi Eagerly Await the Chairman's Arrival

Various sectors of the provincial capital are calling Guling dozens of times a day to inquire about the chairman's itinerary.

Nanchang currently has a population of 200,000. The citizens are known for their frugality, and their diet and lifestyle are in accordance with the essentials of moderation. In the evening, walking on the streets, one sees colorful arches inscribed with "Welcome the Head of State," illuminated by electric lights, dazzling to the eye. The citizens on the bustling streets mostly wear short clothes made of cloth. Most of the fashionable, modern women are from elsewhere, and the number of women with permed hair and lipstick is very small.

Rebuilding Nanchang Requires a Huge Expenditure

The repair work on the roads within the Nanchang urban area has begun. The sewer project is expected to be completed smoothly with the assistance of the Jiangxi branch of the Relief Administration. This project requires more than 16,600,000 yuan, entirely donated by the Jiangxi branch. It is said that the original sewer in the urban area was a foul-smelling open drain 750 meters long. If a person were to put a finger into the filthy water of this drain, it would immediately fester. After the completion of this project, East Lake, the only scenic area in the urban area, will not smell bad year-round because the sewage will not drain into the lake.

Before the war, Nanchang had a total of 46,000 houses. Current surveys show that only 11,000 remain. According to Nanchang Mayor Tang Xin, who told this newspaper's reporter, only 600 houses have been newly built since September last year. It is estimated that it will cost 46 billion yuan to repair all the houses and roads in the city to restore Nanchang.

Nanchang's East Lake scenic area, such as Jiang Gong Causeway, Qingyunpu, the magnificent Martyrs' Cemetery, and the province's extensive, spiderweb-like highways, were all great constructions during the chairman's tenure in the province overseeing the suppression of bandits. The lakeside, tree-lined Jieshi Park is where the citizens of Nanchang will forever remember the chairman's command in Jiangxi to suppress the bandits, save the people of Jiangxi, and the great achievements of his construction. The park is now Nanchang's only cool retreat.

The People are Pure and Simple, and Prices are Very Low

Nanchang is located on the east bank of the Gan River and is the political and economic center of the province. However, because the citizens live frugally and have weak purchasing power, speculators and hoarders mostly do not dare to try their hand here. Most speculative capital flows to Shanghai and Wuhan. The interest rates on loans from local money houses and wealthy individuals reached a maximum of 15% after the war, but are now hovering between 8% and 8.5%. There are no usurious loans in Nanchang, so prices are lower than in the southeastern provinces. From an economic perspective, one can see the beauty of the simple nature of the Jiangxi people and the steady style of Jiangxi merchants.

According to the statistics of the Nanchang Municipal Government and the reporter's investigation, after this foreign exchange adjustment, Nanchang prices fluctuated very little. In summary, of the 89 types of goods, only 37 types of imported goods and foreign cigarettes saw a slight increase, but the highest price increase did not exceed 30%. Among them, wool serge increased by only 3% or 4%, which shows that there are indeed not many speculators in Nanchang.

The highest prices in Jiangxi Province are in Jiujiang, followed by Pingxiang and Ganzhou, and the lowest is in eastern Jiangxi. Nanchang prices are the most stable. The current price of top-grade rice is 30,000 yuan per picul, pork is 1,200 yuan per catty, tea oil is 700 yuan per catty, and lard is 1,300 yuan per catty. Recently, there has been a prolonged drought with no rain, and the average late rice harvest is less than 70%.

Jiangxi Politics Really Wants to Move Forward

Wang Lingji, the current chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, has been in office for less than half a year, and his achievements remain to be seen. Some say that Jiangxi's politics were static in the past, but now they really want to move forward. Chairman Wang Lingji has his own way of using people. He is afraid that cunning officials will tear down the platform and ruin the grassroots politics of Jiangxi. He does not dare to easily select those with extensive county magistrate experience and is currently testing them.

Three-quarters of Jiangxi Province's 83 counties and cities were directly affected by the war. Only more than ten counties such as Ningdu and Ruijin were spared from war damage. However, although this year's harvest is declared to be a bumper one, the farmers are still miserable and in dire need of relief. There are 1.3 million displaced people in urgent need of relief. They hope that the Relief Administration will provide more material relief, especially food and clothing. They do not need beef jerky, canned goods, or high heels.

Jiangxi's biggest difficulty at the moment is "difficulty in rehabilitation." The total amount of rehabilitation funds requested by the provincial government reached 56 billion yuan, but the Executive Yuan only gave 600 million yuan. The rehabilitation funds for mountain education only amounted to 200 million yuan. This amount is only enough to rehabilitate one middle school, so one can imagine the situation for the rest.

New Political Style of Director Li of the Department of Civil Affairs

The newly appointed Director of the Jiangxi Department of Civil Affairs, Li Zhongxiang, is very determined to reform Jiangxi's county administration. He recently planned to inspect all the counties in the province. According to those who interviewed him, the old method of governing politics is "perfunctory," but that has passed. Now, one should be down-to-earth and do practical work. He very much wants to establish a new political style in Jiangxi of "doing it when you see it, doing it when you think of it," and never engage in empty talk.

The most troubling disease for the Jiangxi health administration is none other than the plague in Guangze County on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi. The history of the plague there goes back more than 30 years. During the Anti-Japanese War, the plague spread from Guangze and Nancheng counties to five counties. Although foreign plague expert Burris made many efforts, it has not been eradicated. The plague's epidemic period is late autumn and early winter. It is said that preventive injections have already begun in the epidemic areas of eastern Jiangxi. According to an experienced colleague, the two main reasons why the plague cannot be eradicated in Jiangxi Province are a shortage of funds and the lack of effort from county administrators.

In remote counties in Jiangxi, there is a custom of armed clashes, sometimes lasting for several years. Now, villagers in Fenyi County are fighting again over village mergers and the fight for resources. It is said that hundreds of people have been killed or injured. This matter also deserves attention in Jiangxi, where manpower is not abundant.

Editorial

### US Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged

After US Secretary of State Byrnes delivered a speech in Germany reiterating his policy toward Germany, Commerce Secretary Wallace suddenly delivered a speech in New York a few days later, strongly arguing that it was necessary to change the course of US foreign policy. These two different tones exposed the differences in opinion on foreign policy that are brewing in the United States. People all over the world are waiting for President Truman's decision. Especially Britain, which heard these two diametrically opposed arguments within five days, felt like it had a fever, hot for a while, and then cold for a while.

President Truman's final statement was finally issued the day before yesterday (the 14th). He said: "My original intention was only to express my support for Secretary Wallace's right to make this speech, but I did not intend to express my support for making this speech a statement of our country's foreign policy." He also said: "Our government's established foreign policy has not changed; and foreign policy cannot be subject to any major changes without discussion between the president and the secretary of state, as well as the leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives." The uproar caused by Wallace's speech in the American diplomatic community can therefore return to calm, and countries around the world that are concerned about American foreign policy can also rest assured.

Yesterday's editorial in this newspaper pointed out that Ye's speech would inevitably lead to divisions in the American diplomatic community and even the formation of a struggle between two lines. Only President Truman could make a clear statement to eliminate this consequence invisibly. At this moment, we have learned of President Truman's statement and know that there is no change in American foreign policy, which is of course within our expectations. However, the United States is a democratic country after all, and all domestic and foreign policies and guidelines are based on public opinion. Wallace is the only remaining minister from the era of the late President Roosevelt, and his pro-Soviet remarks will obviously win the approval of a group of radicals. Therefore, internal American views on foreign policy will still be at risk of diverging for a certain period of time.

However, in today's international situation, which is as chaotic as hemp, the work of creating world peace is feeling difficult and heavy, and the United States bears a major responsibility for the creation of peace. The United States must unite from top to bottom and jointly support American foreign policy in order to benefit world peace. As Republican leader Vandenberg said: "American foreign policy relies entirely on domestic unity as its backing, so the Republican and Democratic parties both face the world with a united American front. This is the only way to find peace." We also know that the Democratic Party and the Republican Party in the United States have had largely similar foreign policies over the years, with very few differences. If differences arise in the future, it will not only be difficult for American foreign policy to succeed internationally, but it will also cause a serious reaction to the international situation, and the result will be that the United States itself will ultimately suffer. May American policy, after this uproar, be able to return to calm and remain as firm as ever, using its full strength to support the unity of the democratic countries of the world and strengthen the position and power of the United Nations organization, in order to protect the freedom and peace that humanity should enjoy.

The Target of the Investigation

The Shanghai Municipal Council passed a resolution the day before yesterday to select five senators to participate in the Investigation Team for the Rehabilitation Work in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Area to assist the first group of the team in intensifying their work. This naturally shows that the four million people of Shanghai all want to have a thorough investigation of the rehabilitation work of the past year. However, we must first recognize the target to be investigated.

The establishment of the Investigation Team was based on the resolution of the last Political Consultative Conference. Although the task it is responsible for is extremely important, the investigation period is very short. How can such an important task be completed in just 50 days? This is of course a serious problem. However, in all fairness, although the investigation teams in various places have not achieved brilliant results, it cannot be said that they have not achieved considerable results. First, the investigations in various places have discovered many major cases. In addition to those that have been reported in the newspapers, there are many other important cases that are said to have been secretly submitted to Chairman Chiang for approval. This is unknown to the outside world. Even in Shanghai alone, the number of cases discovered is not small. Second, wherever the investigation team goes, people who have made "rehabilitation money" have to be more cautious. Some rehabilitation officials even hate the informants with a vengeance, calling them "not born of their parents." It is not necessarily a bad thing that the investigation team can make the petty thieves hate them.

However, the political, military, and economic rehabilitation agencies in various places have been carrying out rehabilitation work for more than a year, and the number of materials, factories, real estate, land, vehicles, and all other properties they have accepted is very large. To take just the catalog as an example, it may require cartloads. The investigation team has a limited number of people. In addition to the team leader and members, there are only a few secretaries and staff, and the office expenses are pitifully small. How can these catalogs be investigated one by one? Therefore, only a part of the investigation can be completed in 50 days, and the central government must be requested to extend the investigation time as soon as possible. It is said that the central government has approved the extension to the end of this month. But we predict, what good can be achieved by extending it for another half month? The Shanghai Municipal Council accepted the invitation of the investigation team and decided to send personnel to participate in the work, which is also what we are happy to hear. But what good tune can be sung by only participating in a "coda" section? We can't help but feel a bit worried for the five senators!

When the restored areas saw the light of day again, they all warmly welcomed and wholeheartedly supported the central government. However, because the rehabilitation officials who represented the government to the restored areas only knew how to rehabilitate materials and houses and neglected the hearts of the people in the restored areas, Chairman Chiang had to comfort them and send rehabilitation officials to "rehabilitate the hearts of the people" again. However, the reputation and prestige of the government have already been ruined by these rehabilitation officials. Therefore, we believe that the target of the investigation team's work should be the rehabilitation agencies and rehabilitation officials to investigate whether they are honest, and should not be the people in the restored areas again, making these people who are crying and helpless suffer another round of coercion. Even if corruption and fraud are discovered in the rehabilitation work, it is inevitable that the people will be involved, but those who should be punished should first be the officials who committed rehabilitation fraud, and it should not be possible to humiliate the people who have been repeatedly defrauded before. If the investigation work recognizes the wrong target, that is not conducive to "rehabilitating the hearts of the people," but instead makes the people in the restored areas more confused and uneasy. This should not be the original intention of the investigation team organization, right?

Advice on the Unemployment Problem

The unemployment problem is too serious at the moment. Several proposals and inquiries in the Municipal Council mentioned this problem; and many people urged the government why it did not find a way to solve it earlier. This is of course correct. However, the government itself does not have so many buildings. Without the great efforts of the central government, the principle of Yu Er Hu Ba cannot be forcibly implemented by the factories. Therefore, although the method is very correct, it is obviously not enough to rely solely on this method to solve the unemployment problem.

Someone suggested holding cooperative factories to accommodate these workers; this is also correct. The problem lies in the factories, raw materials, funds, and other prerequisite issues. Even if they are all smoothly resolved, can all these unemployed workers be accommodated? Can their working skills completely match? Are they all willing to join? These are obviously still problems. Therefore, although the method is correct, it is still not enough to rely solely on this method to solve the unemployment problem.

Some people advocate holding large-scale public works to accommodate these workers; this is also correct. There have been many precedents at home and abroad), the central government has issued a clear order, and the city has also held labor relief, absorbing a considerable number of unemployed workers. But unfortunately, the unemployed are still unemployed. It can be seen that although the method is correct, it is still not enough to rely solely on this method to solve the unemployment problem.

Some people strongly advocate that all the enemy and puppet factories that have been rehabilitated should be reopened; this is of course even more correct. However, those that have already started operating are forced to stop operating (recently, it was heard that two textile construction factories have stopped operating). How can those that have not started operating be reopened? Recently, factories in various places have been sold by tender, and there is even no owner. How tragic! It can be seen that the method is not wrong, but it is obviously not enough to rely solely on this method to solve the unemployment problem.

Some people think that since it is not easy to place them, why not hold small loans to temporarily maintain their lives? This is also correct. We conservatively estimate that there are currently 50,000 unemployed workers in Shanghai. If each person is given a loan of 100,000 yuan in national currency, then the total will be 5 trillion yuan. How to raise this huge sum of money, let's not ask for now; but if so many hawkers are added to the market, is there so much business for them to do? Isn't the government now strictly cracking down on stalls? Old stalls are still being cracked down on, how can new stalls be allowed? It can be seen that the method of small loans is also correct, but it is still not enough to rely solely on this method to solve the unemployment problem.

Some people think that most of these workers are not locals, especially those from the rear, and are not local workers. Since the city has no place to place them, it may as well raise a sum of money to send them back to their hometowns. This is also not wrong, but it is close to using the neighbor as a drain and is fundamentally incomplete. Moreover, many have suffered from the war and are already homeless. In the areas disturbed by the Communist Party in northern Jiangsu, we are too late to appease and comfort them, let alone bear to send them forcibly? It can be seen that the method is a method, but it is neither practical nor thorough to rely on this method to solve the unemployment problem.

Unemployment is a social morbidity, especially the social morbidity of China at this time. The root cause is not just one or two. Many are affected by the war, and many are still "man-made" unemployment after the war. We believe that there is no real panacea that can be used to cure the disease and uproot the unemployment disease at this time. Negative relief should always start from many aspects and rely on the efforts of the majority, with different routes leading to the same goal and advancing separately, which may turn the heavy into the light and turn the danger into a blessing. What we think is most important is still that the government should rest and recuperate with the people, so that the people can take care of themselves and restore their vitality. Factories can be opened, business can "make a living," open up more ways for them to make a living, and reduce some hard-working activities that take away their jobs, so that the already unemployed can gradually become employed, and those who are employed must never be made unemployed again. We feel that many of the government's methods now, intentionally or unintentionally, are creating unemployment, promoting unemployment, and increasing unemployment. This is a very disheartening thing!

### Eloquent Discussion on the Trieste Issue: Molotov Takes the Opportunity to Elaborate, Reveals the True Face of Soviet Diplomacy, and Ironically Suggests That the British Political System is Outdated

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 15th] The startling speech delivered by US Secretary of Commerce Wallace in New York a few days ago has caused a major international wave. As its final repercussions are subsiding, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today delivered a stimulating speech at the meeting of the Political and Territorial Committee on Italy, marking his first address since returning to Paris from Moscow. This has triggered a new shock in the political world, truly a case of one wave not yet settled before another rises. In his speech, Molotov took the opportunity to express his views on other more important issues, revealing to some extent the truth of Soviet diplomacy, something that the general public is eager to know. Contrasting the concepts of democracy between Britain and the Soviet Union, Molotov argued that the British concept of democracy is a legacy of the 19th century. While this concept may be a notch above autocratic politics in ordinary times and may have its value, it is now the 20th century and it is imperative to adopt a thoroughly modern democratic politics, such as that created by the Soviet Union. The Soviet system is not only applicable to the Soviet Union itself but can also be implemented in other countries, with Bulgaria being one example. Molotov criticized the British political system, touching upon its colonial rule, saying that the British proposal for the future status of Trieste is no different from what it implements in its colonies. In short, both Wallace's speech and Molotov's speech have extremely broad implications, making it impossible for the countries concerned not to pay close attention to them.

Trieste Should Be Jointly Managed by the Four Powers, and a Democratic Autonomous Government Should Be Established

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 14th] The Political and Territorial Committee on Italy of the Peace Conference held a meeting this afternoon, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a speech on the Trieste issue, lasting an hour. His general idea was that the Council of Foreign Ministers failed to find a solution to the Trieste issue, leaving the Political and Territorial Committee on Italy to face four different proposals to this day, at a loss. As for the Soviet plan, because it advocates granting Trieste a democratic status so that Trieste's interests are protected, it is better able to express the basic principles agreed upon by the Four Powers than any other plan. The so-called basic principles can be divided into two points: (1) The United Nations Security Council should appoint an administrator; (2) Legislative and administrative powers should be exercised in accordance with democratic principles. I believe that the three proposals put forward by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France all use the excuse that the people of Trieste do not yet have the ability to exercise their own sovereignty and entrust all powers to the administrator, which is difficult to accept. Based on this reason, the British plan entrusts all power to the administrator, which is no different from what it does in India and West Africa. But we should be clear that what is suitable for India and West Africa is not suitable for Trieste. On the contrary, the Soviet democratic system, no matter where it is applied, can prove its effectiveness, as Bulgaria is one example.

All Foreign Troops Must Withdraw Within 30 Days of the Treaty Taking Effect

A government of the people, by the people, for the people is the cornerstone of the Soviet plan, which is to give legislative and administrative powers to the People's Congress elected by universal suffrage. The Allied Commission, composed of representatives from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, will have the task of preparing for elections within three months, fundamentally eliminating the remnants of Italian fascism. All foreign troops should withdraw from Trieste within 30 days of the signing of the peace treaty with Italy, and even the United Nations Security Council should not station troops there, because stationing troops would make Trieste a military base. As for the proposal put forward by the Australian representative, which advocates establishing a special council to replace the Security Council to handle all affairs in Trieste, this proposal is inappropriate. Its real purpose is to oppose the exercise of the veto power by the Four Powers. The international organization intends to create world peace and security and create this veto power, which is the first time in history, but the Australian representative is confused by the past and wants to go back in time to the era when there was no veto power. What was the old League of Nations in reality? It was a tool for the British and French groups to rule Europe. What was the result? The Munich Conference and the war. The Munich Conference was a compromise between the British and French groups and the aggressors at the expense of democratic countries. At present, if there is no veto power system, we will inevitably promote the division of the world into two spheres of influence, and the result will be another war and human catastrophe. If we abandon the Five Powers or abandon the Soviet Union and want to create world peace, this attempt will fail. Our views may sometimes be divided, but we should also seek agreement at any cost.

### When Will the Disputes at the Peace Conference End? The Difficulties of the Greek-Bulgarian Border Issue Are Increasing, Threatening to Catch Up with the Trieste Issue

[Reuters, Paris, 14th] Although the Paris Peace Conference has set a deadline for its conclusion, it is still affected by external events. Recent events such as the speech by US Secretary of Commerce Wallace, who advocated dealing with US-Soviet relations in a more peaceful way, is contrary to the hard-line anti-Soviet policy of the US delegation led by Byrnes at the Peace Conference. As a result, the situation at the Peace Conference will inevitably become more complex. It is generally believed that Wallace's speech, without President Truman's approval, will not be taken seriously, but there has been no indication of a change in US policy within the Peace Conference. As for the events within the Peace Conference, the difficulties in the Greek-Bulgarian border issue discussed by the Bulgarian Political and Territorial Committee are increasing, threatening to catch up with the Trieste issue. The latter, in addition to national consciousness, also has the issue of an outlet to the sea for the Eastern European group.

Italian-Austrian Dispute Negotiations Outside the Conference

Soviet representatives in the committee this week have frankly admitted that without resolving major issues of power politics, progress in other areas will be in vain. Due to the ease with which negotiations within the conference are constrained, negotiations outside the conference have also emerged, such as the agreement between Italy and Austria on South Tyrol.

Italian Reparations Issue Under Review

The reparations group of the Italian Economic Committee has begun to review the reparations claims of 13 countries. Italy has stated that it can bear at most 50 million to 75 million pounds in reparations, of which 25 million has already been agreed to be paid to the Soviet Union. Therefore, the subcommittee should seek a balance between the demands of various countries and the amount that Italy can bear to decide. It is also learned that the Dominican Republic was also included in the list of countries demanding reparations from Italy today.

### General Feng Yuxiang Arrives in San Francisco; Eight Hundred Chinese Passengers on the Same Ship

[United Press San Francisco, 15th] The General Meigs arrived here today with 1,500 passengers, including about 800 Chinese passengers, mostly students, coming to study in schools in New York, Chicago, Boston, and other places in the United States. General Feng Yuxiang also arrived on the ship, leading a delegation of six members sent by the Chinese government to the United States to study water conservancy. Among the passengers were also Polish teachers exiled during the war, with 171 students, who were expelled from Poland in 1939, first went to Japan, and then to Shanghai.

### British and American Troops Search for Hidden German Treasure Worth an Estimated $270 Million

[United Press Berlin, 14th] Based on recently obtained clues, British and American detective teams mobilized 3,000 people starting from the 10th of this month to search German banks, factories, private residences, and shops, seeking German treasure hidden and valued at US$270 million. Thirty-five Germans have been arrested in the British occupation zone, and more arrests will follow. In the American occupation zone, precious metals and diamonds worth $35 million have been discovered, and the amount in the British occupation zone is expected to be even higher. According to an official announcement yesterday, the total value of hidden treasures discovered in the two occupation zones has reached $150 million.

### Atomic Energy Commission; Our Turn as Chairman; The Commission's Work Enters a New Phase

[Central News Agency New York, 14th Special Dispatch] In alphabetical order, China is today's rotating chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. Representative Xia Jinlin, currently attending the Paris Peace Conference as a representative of Guo Taiqi, will assume the chairmanship of the commission. Xia told a Central News Agency reporter that after three months of work, the Atomic Energy Commission has now entered a new phase, focusing on practical issues rather than empty talk about general principles. Xia also said that China is interested in atomic energy because of its "potential to benefit humanity."

### De Gaulle Alliance's Power Gradually Expands, Criticizing the French Constituent Assembly as Undemocratic

[Central News Agency Paris, 14th Special Dispatch] Various comrades of the French Liberation Movement, in support of De Gaulle's foundation for the French constitution announced in Bayeux, France, have formed the De Gaulle Alliance, which is now gradually expanding its power, with 500,000 people already signing up to join the new alliance. In addition, representatives of other parties, except the Communist Party, have also publicly or secretly expressed their contact with the new alliance. The De Gaulle Alliance has consistently criticized the Constituent Assembly as undemocratic and as a united dictatorship of various factions. If the alliance cannot gain the support of other forces, it will launch a massive propaganda campaign to have the constitution drawn up by the Constituent Assembly rejected in the citizen referendum held in October. The alliance firmly tells the Popular Republican Movement that it should agree with De Gaulle's proposed new constitutional foundation, which emphasizes executive power and places the president as the arbitrator above all parties.

### American Wife Has a Big Cigar Habit; Smokes Cigars in Bed; Husband Complains of Headaches and Requests Divorce

### U.S. Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged; Truman Issues Statement; Only Approves Wallace's Right to Speak; Republican Party Seizes the Opportunity to Criticize the Government

[Reuters Washington, 14th] President Truman received reporters today and announced that he had withdrawn his approval of Commerce Secretary Wallace's speech. The President stated that what he approved was Wallace's right to speak. President Truman had previously said when approving Wallace's speech that he saw no difference between Byrnes's policy and Wallace's policy. However, today, President Truman stated that his approval of that speech did not mean that he wanted the speech to be a statement of our country's foreign policy. "My reply at the press conference on Thursday has caused misunderstandings. My reply was made casually, and it failed to express my original intention. My original intention was to approve Secretary of Commerce Wallace's right to make a speech, and not to approve his speech as a statement of our country's foreign policy. Our established foreign policy remains unchanged. There will be no major changes in foreign policy until the President, the Secretary of State, and members of Congress have discussed it."

[United Press Paris, 14th] It was learned here today that U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and his two Senate advisors have forced President Truman to deny that he had previously approved Commerce Secretary Wallace's speech as a statement of U.S. foreign policy. Since Wallace's speech caused an uproar internationally, Byrnes and the President have not spoken by long distance, but it is known that Senators Connally and Vandenberg have spoken with Truman, saying a great deal. Vandenberg warned Truman that in such circumstances, the President's foreign policy could not reliably maintain bipartisan support, and told the President that he should choose one person between Wallace and Byrnes to be the spokesperson for foreign policy. Connally called for domestic unity in support of Byrnes, indirectly accusing Wallace of having political ambitions.

[Reuters Washington, 14th] Acting Secretary of State Clayton discussed U.S. foreign policy and the relationship with Truman today in Washington. Clayton reported to reporters that he did not directly discuss Wallace's speech, but only discussed the topic of peace. Clayton's visit to the President was not announced beforehand, and Clayton said afterward that any statements on this matter would be issued by President Truman. Clayton also said that he had not spoken with Byrnes since Wallace gave his speech.

[Agence France-Presse Jefferson City, USA, 14th] Republican National Committee Chairman Reece gave a speech here today, criticizing the Truman administration, stating that the Democratic Party is now controlled by a few leaders who are directing the party's policies, and that these people are only concerned with foreign ideas and are not very concerned about maintaining the form of our own government.

[Agence France-Presse Washington, 14th] Republican Campaign Committee Chairman Brown issued a statement today calling for the resignation of Commerce Secretary Wallace. He said: "It is unpleasant for two members of Truman's cabinet to express contradictory opinions on such important issues. This situation is both a disgrace to the country and a crisis for the country."

### Wallace's Political Views Receive Labor Support; An Unsafe Searchlight; Reviewing U.S. Foreign Policy

[Reuters Washington, 14th] Observers here believe that if American labor rises to support Commerce Secretary Wallace's speech on Thursday, Wallace's position will be greatly strengthened. Democratic leaders have remained silent about the speech so far, but Republican National Committee publicist Brown said that Wallace's sudden speech at a time when the U.S. government is trying to win over radicals clearly intends to allow the government to adopt it. Others say that Wallace's speech is in preparation for running for Vice President in 1948, intending to promote the unity of left-wingers before the congressional elections this fall. It is also said that Wallace, with the support of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, intends to follow in Roosevelt's footsteps and establish an understanding with the Soviet Union. It is generally believed here that Wallace's speech was a carefully considered one, and that President Truman's approval was intended to maintain a balance between the opposing opinions of Byrnes and Wallace before the congressional elections.

[United Press Miami, Florida, 14th] Senator Pepper, a Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, declared today that Commerce Secretary Gruenwald's speech in New York was tantamount to examining American foreign policy with a security searchlight, and that it contributed greatly to peace. Wallace's claims are very close to the public opinion of the American people. From my point of view, the policies pursued by the State Department are not sufficient to represent public opinion. Ninety-five percent of the resentment towards the Soviet Union is "empty propaganda" from reactionaries and imperialists.

### France and the Viet Minh Government Signed an Agreement Yesterday

### U.S. Navy Department Actively Developing; Unmanned Controlled Missile Weapons; Capable of Carrying Atomic Bombs at Thousands of Miles Per Hour

[United Press Washington, 14th] The head of the U.S. Navy Department's Radio-Controlled Missile Weapons Group said that when World War II occurred, there would be unmanned arrows that could carry atomic bombs to targets at speeds of thousands of miles per hour. The U.S. Navy Department, considering that the U.S. fleet that swept away the Japanese Navy in the Pacific would lose its effectiveness in a few years, is actively planning to develop various unmanned controlled missile weapons, all of which have extraordinary power. The more important ones are as follows: (1) Radio-controlled rockets that can travel at speeds of thousands of miles per hour, carrying atomic bombs, and can detect any target. (2) Missile weapons that attack submarines and ships, can penetrate deep into the water, and hit rapidly moving targets. (3) Can launch missiles from under the sea surface to strike enemy targets on shore. (4) Radar-controlled gliding bombs, with great power and accurate launching. (5) Launch radio-controlled missile weapons from land, sea, and air. (6) Can carry 500-pound bombs to an altitude of 120 miles above the ground.

### Newly Discovered Old Historical Facts; One: German-Soviet-Italian-Spanish Alliance; Two: Nazis Launched Germ Warfare

— ——Written by United Press Lander——

The U.S. State Department recently released a type of obtained German secret document, which is a record of the talks between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. According to it, Mussolini suggested in 1941 that Hitler organize a "European Joint Front" with Germany, Italy, Spain, and the Soviet Union as its backbone to defeat Britain. The two leaders of the Axis powers unanimously believed that the Axis powers should try in every way to persuade France to declare war on Britain together. When assessing the hope of winning the war, Lee assured Mussolini that the so-called rearmament of the United States was really a "historical exaggeration."

The document specified that the main purpose of this meeting was to discuss the relationship between the Axis powers and Darlan, the then French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, the Hess incident, and the preparations for the next meeting between the two giants, Hitler and Mussolini. This matter occurred only a few months before Hitler decided to abandon a full-scale offensive against Britain and instead attack the Soviet Union.

According to the document, Ribbentrop told Mussolini: "The Führer believes that we must strive for final victory no matter what. In order to achieve this goal, he is willing to take the biggest step towards France." Lee continued: "The French question is being handled according to this principle. To what extent Darlan is willing to cooperate can be known at this moment. But concessions to France should be exchanged for France's help in the war against Britain."

Mussolini's answer was "France can contribute many small but extremely important assists to the Axis powers." He emphasized: "When the Axis powers are victorious, France often gets closer to the Axis powers. But when the situation is not good, she turns to Britain and the United States for flirtation."

The document continued: A German Foreign Minister expressed his agreement, saying: If France can be drawn into the Axis powers organization, it will definitely make a deep impression on the United States. Mussolini agreed with the German Foreign Minister's opinion, citing Hitler's strategy of uniting all of Europe against Britain. Only the Soviet Union and Spain have not yet joined this united front. The then Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer had declared that Spain would implement participation in the war after the harvest season this year. But this point in him is extremely doubtful. The German Foreign Minister said. Unfortunately, at the beginning of this year (1941), France and Langcol did not agree with the Axis powers. If France had joined the Axis powers at that time, the Strait of Gibraltar would have been seized from the British long ago, and the Spanish could have obtained more food, instead of begging for alms from Britain and the United States without getting anything. At this time, Mussolini mentioned again the European United Front against Britain and the two countries that had not yet joined the front, Spain and the Soviet Union. He repeatedly declared that if the policy of cooperation with the Soviet Union could be realized as desired, it would, in his opinion, be beneficial to the Axis powers.

Later, the three people's topic turned to the United States. Ribbentrop ridiculed the American rearmament plan as "the greatest exaggeration in history." Mussolini seemed to agree with the suggestion that "internal divisions have already occurred within the United States," and cited the speeches of former U.S. President Hoover and Colonel Lindbergh as representative arguments against the anti-Axis policies of the late President Roosevelt.

The work of interrogating German criminals in Nuremberg is about to end, and the crimes of the defendants can be announced by the end of this month.

It seems that the heinous crimes committed by the Hitler Party against humanity have been described in detail, but in addition to atrocities such as burning people alive, a reporter from the Truth Daily recently reported on the latest crimes of the Nazi bandits. This article, entitled "The Last Secret of Fascism," is about the latest discovered crimes of the Hitler Party members. Let us now let the facts speak for themselves and let us hear the confession of the Director of Medicine and Bacteriological Expert of the German High Command, Schlieber.

According to this Schlieber, "After the German army was defeated in Stalingrad, a secret meeting was held in Berlin. At this meeting, the representative of the German General Staff announced Hitler's order to engage in germ warfare."

Schlieber participated in the meeting as an expert and was asked to present a conclusion. At the same time, Göring was responsible for establishing a bacterial warfare committee. This happened in July 1943.

This preparation was carried out at a crazy speed. Professor Balmi established a special college that was moved from Germany to Posen in Poland to carry it out; there, Nazi murderers cultivated bacteria and conducted experiments on humans.

Everything was prepared to attack humanity with this vicious weapon, but this last trump card of the Nazis was broken by the Red Army. The Soviet army occupied Posen with a lightning-like attack, so this bacterial manufacturing base also fell into the hands of the Red Army. Although Hitler's bandits tried to blow it up and destroy the traces, it was too late.

However, the German High Command did not give up because of this. They moved the germ warfare manufacturing facility to Sassnitzburg in order to complete this work that harms the entire human race. But because of the rapid advance of the Red Army, the Nazis' plan failed again this time.

The Red Army began to attack Berlin, and the fascist rats fled the sinking Hitler ship, attempting to save their hides; German administration fell into a standstill, and the germ warfare was therefore not realized. The heroic Red Army broke Hitler's most vicious last chess piece. This Nazi plan threatened the entire human race. Germ warfare, when mentioned, makes one shudder.

The Red Army discovered the Nazis' last secret and saved the human race.

### The Senate Convened a Plenary Review Meeting Yesterday: Meticulously Examining and Calculating the Municipal Government's Budget; The Mayor Explained that Streamlining Expenses Has Reached the Highest Limit, and the People's Burden is Lighter Than Before the War

[Report from Our Newspaper] In order to ensure prudence and thoroughness in the review of the Municipal Government's budget for the second half of the year, the Senate specially convened a plenary review meeting yesterday morning for a preliminary review of the principles.

The meeting began at 9:20 AM. First, the Mayor reported on the budget preparation process. Then, Xu Yongzuo, convener of the Ninth Review Group, and Li Wenjie, both CPAs, successively reported on the proceedings of the two group meetings and their personal opinions on the budget review. After a ten-minute break at 11:00 AM, the senators expressed their views one after another with great enthusiasm and actively participated in the discussion. In between, Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, provided supplementary explanations regarding requests for subsidies from the Central Government and the imposition of additional house taxes. The meeting was extended to 12:30 PM but still could not be concluded. The Speaker announced that due to time constraints, the meeting would be adjourned first, and senators who had not yet spoken could continue to express their views at the third meeting of the Ninth Review Group in the afternoon. The Speaker summarized the various opinions expressed in the morning, and the resulting principles were: first, to review whether all construction projects are truly necessary and whether administrative management expenses can be further reduced to achieve streamlining; if there is indeed a shortfall, then to further discuss ways to increase revenue.

At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the third meeting of the Ninth Review Group was held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The Bureaus of Public Works, Land Administration, and Finance reported on the uses of the budget. Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, specifically pointed out that the percentage of administrative expenses of the Municipal Government and the concession in 1936 was much higher than today, while the percentage of construction expenses today is more than double that of that time. This, he said, is sufficient to show the Municipal Government's emphasis on construction.

The Mayor reported on the budget preparation process, stating first that due to the limited time and having just taken office, he was not yet familiar with the situation in the city, so the budget preparation was indeed not entirely satisfactory. He then explained the budget format and preparation guidelines separately, stating: (1) The senators believe that the budget format is too simple and resembles a castle in the air. However, there are practical difficulties because government agencies are different from commercial organizations, and administrative expenses and core business expenses are not easy to distinguish, and there are no regulations for such distinction in the central government's common practice. As for the work plan on which the budget is based, although it can be roughly seen in the budget, it is indeed not detailed enough. To remedy this, the number of existing personnel in the Municipal Government's establishment and the work plan for this year are being printed separately for reference. (2) Preparation guidelines: 1. In terms of streamlining expenses, I personally believe that it has been implemented to the highest limit. Before the war, the three institutions of the Municipal Government, the Public Works Bureau, and the French Municipal Council had a total of more than 5,000 employees. During Mayor Qian's tenure, there were also more than 3,500 employees. Now it has been reduced to more than 2,900 employees. Therefore, in terms of management fees, it is only more than half of what it was before the war. If further reductions are insisted upon, please consider the practical difficulties and provide "flexible" regulations. 2. This time, the budget is prepared neither based on income nor based on expenditure. If it were based on expenditure, the flood control project alone would require more than 10 billion yuan, and the construction of roads and bridges would also require 10 billion to 20 billion yuan, which is practically impossible. Therefore, the existing budget is prepared by seeking austerity on the one hand and construction on the other under the current social and economic conditions, calculating the minimum maintenance costs and the minimum business expenses. Before the war, the total annual expenditure of the three administrative institutions was more than 50 million yuan, which, calculated at 5,000 times the currency value, amounts to more than 270 billion yuan today, half of which is more than 130 billion yuan, which is more than the current semi-annual budget of more than 80 billion yuan. Furthermore, in terms of the people's burden, before the war, it was about 15 to 16 yuan per person per year. Now, based on a population of 4 million, calculated for half a year, it is about 20,000 yuan per person, and the whole year is 40,000 yuan, which, calculated at 5,000 times, is only equivalent to 8 yuan before the war.

The Mayor further emphasized that the Senate is the highest decision-making body of the municipality and can control financial power by passing budgets and final accounts. The success or failure of municipal administration largely depends on the decision-making body. Therefore, the current budget should be reviewed rationally and should not be based entirely on reducing the people's burden. "Otherwise," the Mayor concluded his report with a smiling tone, "nothing needs to be done."

### House Tax and Municipal Tax: There Seems to Be Overlap; Report of Opinions from Xu Yongzuo, Convener of the Ninth Group

Xu Yongzuo, CPA, one of the conveners of the Ninth Group Review Committee, reported on the proceedings of the two meetings of the Group and the Third Subcommittee, and then expressed his personal opinions: (1) Analyzing the figures, the total semi-annual budget of 84.7 billion yuan, calculated based on a population of 4 million, averages 21,000 yuan per person for half a year. Compared with the national total budget of 2,524.9 billion yuan for this year, it accounts for about 6.7% for half a year. (2) Regarding the comparison of expenses with the three administrative institutions before the war, the total expenditure of the three administrative institutions in 1936 was more than 47 million yuan, which, calculated at 5,000 times, amounts to more than 110 billion yuan today for half a year, which seems to be more than the current budget of 84.7 billion yuan. However, upon detailed analysis, more than 52% of the current budget is for staff salaries and living allowances, which, calculated according to the central government's regulations, is only equivalent to 1,500 times that of before the war. Therefore, if 52% is converted at 1,500 times, the semi-annual expenses of the three administrative institutions before the war are equivalent to about 77 billion yuan today, and a portion of this is debt expenditure that must be excluded from the calculation. Furthermore, the salaries of foreign employees before the war were particularly high and cannot be compared with those of current civil servants. Therefore, the actual calculation shows that the semi-annual expenditure of the three administrative institutions before the war is only equivalent to 72 billion yuan today. (3) The largest part of the expenditure in the budget is salaries and living allowances, accounting for more than 52%. It is best to analyze which belongs to administrative expenses and which belongs to business expenses. Judging from the classification table currently printed by the Municipal Government, the number of tenured personnel seems to be too large. (4) The current state of financial revenue is still unreasonable. Housing tax should be implemented as soon as possible, such as the registered land value tax and the house tax in the Nanshi Zhabei cross-border area. In addition, attention can be paid to the beneficiary fees for public utilities and private license fees. At a time when people's livelihoods are declining, large-scale municipal administration cannot rely entirely on donations and taxes. My personal opinion is that funds can be raised through borrowing. (5) Among the five methods submitted by the Municipal Government to make up for the shortfall in revenue and expenditure, the house tax and municipal tax seem to overlap. Furthermore, the increase in house tax is too large and exceeds the rent, which is obviously in conflict with central government laws and regulations.

### Senators Express Opinions: Are All the Construction Projects in the Plan Necessary? Can Administrative Expenses Be Further Reduced?

The senators expressed their opinions on the Municipal Government's budget. The first to step up to the microphone was Lu Shidao. He said, "To review the budget, we must first consider several major premises: (1) The Municipal Government is not a profit-making organization. It cannot do anything without money. (2) If we give money, how much do we give? (3) Where does the money we give come from? (4) What will be the result after we give the money? Can the citizens afford it? I believe that the current Municipal Government is full of vigor. If we don't pass the budget, it will not be able to do anything. We represent the people. We only ask whether things are right or wrong, regardless of whether people scold us or not. Therefore, I advocate several principles: (1) Distinguish clearly between the construction projects that the Municipal Government wants to undertake. Which things should not be done, and which things should be done. For the things that need to be done, we will give the Municipal Government as much money as it needs. (2) As for the source of the money, the citizens will always have to add a little to their burden, but we should not create too many items. We can focus on one or two donations and taxes that people can afford. (3) The Municipal Government should mind its own business less and shift the passive regulatory fees to active construction fees."

Fu Rulin left the meeting early due to business. He wrote down several points of opinion in advance and asked Lu Shidao to express them on his behalf: (1) He believes that the budget of 84.7 billion yuan should be approved in full. (2) The central government has clear regulations on the allocation of business fees and administrative fees. (3) The projects that need to be done can be done in stages. (4) The shortage of funds can be subsidized by requesting assistance from the central government.

Zhan Wen then said: "First, the Senate, considering its own position, adheres to the principle that the laws and regulations we pass do not conflict with central government laws and regulations. Among the five methods for increasing tax revenue submitted by the Municipal Government, the municipal donation, cleaning donation, and public utility surcharge have no legal basis. The house tax item, if it exceeds the rent, also conflicts with central government laws and regulations and gives landlords an excuse to increase rents. As for the issue of opening up the racecourse, the Mayor said that the income from racing can recover the racecourse within two years, but if we calculate the monthly income at 400 million yuan, it will only be 9.6 billion yuan in two years, while the racecourse alone is worth more than 300 billion yuan in land value. How can we recover it? As for foreigners wanting to build houses at the racecourse, the Public Works Bureau has the right to stop them, which is not a reason to open up racing. Therefore, I advocate that the missing 20 billion yuan in construction fees can be levied separately under the house tax item."

### The Central Government Takes a Lot of Money Away: It Should Return Some

Tao Baichuan supplemented the opinion raised by Fu Rulin about requesting assistance from the central government. He said, "The central government has taken a lot of money from Shanghai. It should return some. The Mayor doesn't have to be polite!"

Ji believes that the number of Municipal Government personnel can still be reduced, especially in the Secretariat and the Land Administration Bureau. Not only are there too many staff members, but there are also too many public servants. As for the five tax increase methods submitted by the Mayor, they are all clever creations, which Sichuan people call "unacceptable!" However, he believes that horse racing can be regarded as a sport, but it should be held in the suburbs.

Deputy Director Xu Jiyun also expressed his opinion. He said, "We should not be afraid when we see the word 'billion'. A clever housewife cannot cook without rice. We must assist the Municipal Government."

Director Gu provided supplementary explanations regarding requesting assistance from the central government and the house tax. Then, Tong Hangbai stepped up and expressed his opinion, saying, "On the revenue side, we should seek a fundamental solution from the land value tax and implement the land policy of the Three Principles of the People. On the expenditure side, there must be a certain ratio between business fees and administrative fees. Administrative efficiency does not depend on having a large number of people."

Wang Zhuyi's opinion is more in line with the "principle" of review. He believes that the first thing to do in reviewing the budget is to broaden the scope, the second is to assess the work, and the third is that the senators must take responsibility and not be afraid of external attacks. He said, "It is impossible to 'want the horse to run fast but not want it to eat grass.' " In addition, he also advocates requesting assistance from the central government.

### Construction Aims to Benefit the People: Increasing the Burden Harms the People

Fei Shusheng loudly called for a reduction to below 60 billion yuan. He said that the purpose of construction is to benefit the people, but now we must first increase the burden, which harms the people instead. Moreover, the budget has increased four times, and other prices are bound to be affected and increase. How can we cope with this cycle? Therefore, he advocates not doing things that are not necessary and saving as much as possible on things that need to be done.

The time has been extended to 12:30 PM, and there are still many slips of paper on the chairman's platform requesting to speak. The speaker stood up and said, "All the opinions can be summarized into two principles: First, we should first review whether all the construction projects in the plan are necessary. Second, can the expenses in administrative management be further reduced? If it is still not enough, then we will study ways to increase revenue. Senators who do not have time to speak can express their opinions at the meeting of the Ninth Review Group in the afternoon."

[Another report] The reporter talked with Senator Wang Wei yesterday about the comparison between the house tax and the municipal tax in the cases submitted by the Mayor. According to the discussion, both have their advantages and disadvantages, but the house tax has more advantages. Furthermore, the new method limits the amount of tax borne by the landlord to only 20% of the actual rent. If the rent is increased, the amount of tax borne will also increase proportionally, so it can have the effect of adjusting with the rent. Furthermore, the collection data are all readily available, and only the standard needs to be determined, which is relatively simple and easy to implement. The annual income can be 6 billion yuan more than the municipal tax.

### The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends a Letter to the Senate: Please Forward Eight Suggestions

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Municipal Senate yesterday, requesting that the eight suggestions for saving the industrial and commercial crisis be submitted to the central government and implemented quickly. The spokesperson of the Chamber of Commerce also made a statement, stating the circumstances of the suspension of loans by the Shanghai Branch of the Four Joint Offices.

### The Third Review Meeting of the Ninth Group: Listening to the Explanations of the Budget from the Bureaus of Public Works, Land Administration, and Finance

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Ninth Subcommittee responsible for reviewing the Municipal Government's budget held its third review meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 3:00 PM yesterday, listening to the explanations of the budget from the Bureaus of Public Works, Land Administration, and Finance. Xu Yongzuo served as the chairman, and more than a dozen senators attended, as well as Zhao Zukang, Zhu Ping, and Gu Chunfan, the three directors, and the accounting directors of each bureau. Speaker Pan and Deputy Speaker Xu also attended the meeting one after another. First, Senator Chu Shun spoke, dividing the budgets for education, culture, construction, and health into necessary, secondary, and again secondary, assessing the urgency and reducing them, based on the principle of not conflicting with central government laws and regulations. He also suggested separately levying a municipal construction donation, dedicated to municipal construction, and hoped that the Municipal Government would run more productive enterprises to subsidize municipal expenditures. At the same time, he advocated requesting assistance from the central government.

Then, Senator Zhu Wende requested that the various bureaus provide more review materials for reference during the review. Regarding tax revenue, Senator Zhu's opinions were: (1) Oppose the progressive house tax system. The house tax in the Nanshi and Zhabei districts should be resumed immediately. (2) Increasing the land value tax can stimulate rent. (3) Cotton is the main crop planted in the fields of this city, so it is unfair to convert the land tax at the price of grain. Senator Zhu believes that it is most appropriate to request assistance from the central government for the financial difficulties of this city. Senator Li Wenjie specifically proposed a method for disposing of the Municipal Government's public land, increasing the land value for purchasers of land during the enemy and puppet period, and transferring the proceeds to the funding for land right consolidation. He also expressed that the Senate is not simply reducing the budget for each bureau. If it is indeed necessary, it can also be increased. Afterwards, the chairman asked Director Zhao of the Bureau of Public Works to explain first. Director Zhao said: The budget of this bureau is generally divided into (1) Regular administrative expenses - including road worker wages. (2) Regular business expenses - including eight major tasks such as roads, bridges, ditches, and houses. (3) Temporary business expenses - which are more flexible. The bureau has three principles for using personnel: less internal and more external, less work and more skills, and fewer positions and more workers. That is, more field staff than internal affairs, more technical personnel than administrative personnel, and more workers than employees. In terms of staffing, attention is paid to the malpractices that occur during contracting and purchasing materials, and a check-and-balance system is adopted. The three powers of material procurement, material allocation, and material use are separated. The temporary budget of 12.1 billion yuan for the second half of the year is higher than the 7.7 billion yuan for the first half of the year. Although the nominal figures have increased, the prices and wages in the second half of the year are much higher than in the first half of the year, so it has not actually increased. The average price of building materials has increased 10,000 times compared with before the war. Director Zhao specifically proposed building a north-south avenue through Xizang Road, Song Park Road, and Manufacturing Bureau Road to average the future development of this city. Next, Director Zhu Ping of the Land Administration Bureau explained that the collection of 3 billion yuan in land value tax is not guaranteed before the land is completely consolidated, and explained the distribution of the estimated 3.1 billion yuan.

### Gu Chunfan Explains Difficulties: House Tax is a Central Government Regulation

[Report from Our Newspaper] Director Gu Chunfan of the Finance Bureau explained the difficulties in adjusting tax revenue at the plenary budget review meeting yesterday morning, saying: I am more concerned about the budget and finances than everyone else. It is not easy to obtain allocations from the central government at present, because the central government has allocated a part of it last year and in the first half of this year, but since the central government convened a meeting on the financial revenue and expenditure system in July, it has clearly stipulated what should be allocated to local governments. At the same time, local municipal administration and business construction cannot be interrupted for a day. If we have to ask the central government every time, it is practically impossible. Even if the central government approves the allocation, work will be suspended during the application period.

In addition, someone proposed levying a gasoline tax, but the gasoline tax is a commodity tax and should belong to the central government, not the local government. An application was submitted to the central government to allocate the dockage fee in the first half of the year, but it was not approved, and it has now been submitted again. The suggestion to increase the vehicle license tax is indeed acceptable, but there is no guarantee at the moment. The land value tax has already been included in the budget. The house tax is a central government regulation and must be levied. The municipal donation is a special donation of the local government and is determined by the local government. Increasing the house tax does not necessarily affect the rent. Whether the rent needs to be changed is still up to the Senate to decide. The house tax is levied at 20% of the actual rent.

### Municipal Government Budget Compared with Before the War: Construction Expenses Have Increased Significantly; Gu Chunfan Reports at the Review Meeting

Finally, Gu Chunfan of the Finance Bureau reported on the budget for various taxes, saying: The land tax is levied at 9.2 dou of grain per mu, equivalent to 4.6 dou of rice. If converted according to the current price of rice, it is as high as more than 34,000 yuan, while it was only 1 yuan before the war. Therefore, the Finance Bureau believes it is too high and has requested the Ministry of Food to reduce it, based on the principle of not exceeding the multiple of prices. The collection method will also be innovated on a trial basis, without using the old method of local security. The original budget for the house tax was 2.7 billion yuan. The level standards and collection methods will be decided by the general assembly. Of the 890 million yuan in expenditures of the Finance Bureau, the cost of printing tickets and documents is 450 million yuan, accounting for half of the total. Director Gu also announced the increase or decrease in the percentage of the total expenditure of the Municipal Government and the two concessions in 1936 compared with the current Municipal Government's various budgets: (1) Police and public security fees have decreased from 30% to 27%. (2) Administrative fees have decreased from 16.87% to 4%. (3) Construction fees have increased from 16% to 30%. (4) Cultural and educational fees have increased from 9.4% to 13.5%. (5) Health fees have increased from 5.2% to 10.8%. The increase in the various budgets for the second half of the year compared with the first half of the year: (1) The Bureau of Public Works actually spent 5.162 billion yuan in the first half of the year, and the budget for the second half of the year is 17.996 billion yuan, an increase of 12.834 billion yuan. (2) The Police Bureau spent 4.634 billion yuan in the first half of the year, and the budget for the second half of the year is 17.728 billion yuan, an actual increase of 13.094 billion yuan. (3) The Education Bureau spent 2.729 billion yuan in the first half of the year, and the budget for the second half of the year is 16.239 billion yuan, an actual increase of 13.51 billion yuan. (4) The Health Bureau spent 2.178 billion yuan in the first half of the year, and the budget for the second half of the year is 13.612 billion yuan, an actual increase of 11.434 billion yuan. (5) The Public Utilities Bureau spent 910 million yuan in the first half of the year, and the budget for the second half of the year is 4.356 billion yuan, an actual increase of 3.446 billion yuan. (6) The Land Administration Bureau spent 751 million yuan in the first half of the year, and the budget for the second half of the year is 3.131 billion yuan, an actual increase of 2.38 billion yuan. (7) The Civil Affairs Office spent 1.146 billion yuan in the first half of the year, and the budget for the second half of the year is 2.976 billion yuan, an actual increase of 1.83 billion yuan. (8) The Finance Bureau spent 608 million yuan in the first half of the year, and the budget for the second half of the year is 2.349 billion yuan, an actual increase of 1.741 billion yuan. (9) The Secretariat of the Municipal Government spent 815 million yuan in the first half of the year, and the budget for the second half of the year is 1.751 billion yuan, an actual increase of 936 million yuan. (10) The Social Affairs Bureau spent 308 million yuan in the first half of the year, and the budget for the second half of the year is 1.319 billion yuan, an actual increase of 1.011 billion yuan. After Director Gu's report, Li Wenjie, Zhu Fuqiu, and others raised questions, and the three directors gave answers, mostly related to land administration. Finally, Speaker Pan gave the review team two instructions: (1) Reduce the Municipal Government's budget as much as possible where it can be reduced, and increase it where it is necessary to increase it. (2) Please prepare a preliminary plan and speed up the review work. Passing the Municipal Government's budget is one of the important tasks of the Senate. The review team will continue to meet today.

### The China Trust Bureau Handles Enemy and Puppet Houses: Decided to Launch a Review; The Total Number of Enemy and Puppet Materials Handled and Received Exceeds One Trillion

(C) Educational and cultural agencies used 231 buildings. (D) Staff dormitories of rear factories used 458 buildings.

### Former Workers Disgruntled with Arbitration, Gather Crowd to Vandalize New Quan Pool

[Our Dispatch] A group of former workers from the New Quan Pool Bathhouse at 197-199 Fuxing Road Central, disgruntled with the arbitration terms of the Social Affairs Bureau, gathered a large group of over a hundred hooligans around six or seven o'clock last night.

They also smashed and damaged glass windows, desks, chairs, and other items. The relevant police station, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched a large number of police officers to surround and arrest them, apprehending several workers involved in the incident on the spot. The injured were sent to Nanyang Hospital by the police for treatment.

### Why Interfere with "Interpretone"? Xin Guang Theater Accuses Ticket Holder of Theft

To facilitate the audience when showing Western films, major first-run movie theaters in the city are equipped with "Interpretone" devices. Yesterday afternoon around 2:50 PM, when the first showing of "Divine Eagle Wanli" at the Xin Guang Theater on Ningbo Road was about to begin, a ticket taker discovered that a spectator had taken the wrong seat. When the person who had the correct seat arrived and asked him to move, it was noticed that the guest's rented Interpretone was not on his ear but on his lap. Suspecting theft, the ticket taker reported it to the theater manager, who took the customer to the Lao Zha District Police Station. The person identified himself as Huang Juchen, 38 years old, from Pudong, a cotton cloth merchant. He claimed to have bought a ticket and entered the theater around 2:00 PM. To understand the plot, he rented an Interpretone from the theater, but found it was broken and made no sound after the show started. Because the theater was dark and half the show had already played, he didn't want to leave his seat to exchange it, so he placed the Interpretone on his lap. Unexpectedly, the theater accused him of being a thief. He also said that if he had taken the Interpretone out of the theater and was discovered, he could be suspected of theft, but since he was watching the show, even if the Interpretone worked, whether or not he listened was his own business. Furthermore, it was on his lap, not hidden in his pocket, so there was no question of him being a thief. The police station agreed that his explanation was reasonable and refused to accept the case. It is understood that Huang, because he was taken out of the theater before the end of the show without cause, has approached the theater for a refund of his ticket.

### Accountant Accused of Embezzlement, Released on Bail Due to Insufficient Evidence

### Negligence in Dock Security, Entire Pieces of Fabric Stolen

It had been stolen by thieves taking advantage of the opportunity. He immediately reported the theft to the relevant Feipu District Police Station requesting an investigation.

### Too Few Animals in Shanghai, Wu Zhengwei Advocates Expanding the Zoo

[Our Dispatch] Councilor Wu Zhengwei, noting that zoos are valuable educational resources beneficial for children's knowledge and that Shanghai's only zoo has been destroyed and not restored, and expressing regret that a panda was sent on a special plane directly to London, has requested the Bureau of Public Works to expedite the collection or purchase of animals to enrich the existing zoo and add new ones. Wu stated that before August 13th, the city had two zoos, namely the Confucius Temple and the Zhaohe Park. After the Confucius Temple was affected by the war, the French Municipal Council, at the request of the local authorities, sent troops to move a pair of lions, a female tiger, a leopard, a black panther, a giant python, and a black bear, as well as four peacocks, to the French Park for refuge. Unfortunately, due to the climate, the giant python froze to death first, and the black bear, black panther, lions, and tigers successively died of lung disease. During that time, the French also purchased sharks, monkeys, and various other animals, which were later moved by the enemy forces to Zhaofeng Park. After the victory, due to poor management, most of the animals died from lack of sustenance.

### Comparison of Shanghai Municipal Government's Financial Budget and Revenue/Expenditure Totals for the First Half of the Year

[Our Dispatch] Councilor Li Wenjie, convener of the Ninth Group, reviewed the municipal government's budget and presented the following report comparing the financial budget and revenue/expenditure totals with the first half of the year:

Current rent, house tax, and examples of proposed increases in house tax by the Municipal Government:

Assuming a pre-war rent of 20 yuan, the current rent has increased 140 times, making it 2,800 yuan. The house tax, calculated at 14% of the pre-war rent, was 2.8 yuan, now increased 540 times, totaling 1,512 yuan, which the central government stipulates is to be borne by the landlord. The municipal government plans to increase the house tax rate to 20% in the future without changing the rent. The increase factor is graded into A, B, and C categories, with A being increased to 3,000 times, B to 2,000 times, and C to 1,000 times. For example, if calculated at the C level, a rent of 20 yuan would incur a house tax of 4,000 yuan, with the landlord paying 560 yuan and the tenant paying 3,440 yuan, to demonstrate adjustment.

According to Councilor Li's personal opinion, citizens should support the municipal government as much as possible for expenditures related to business development and should not advocate for reductions. However, administrative expenses should be reduced as much as possible to alleviate the burden on the people.

### Female Principal Detained for Allegedly Forging Seals and Official Stamps, Husband Li Boqing Released on Bail After Questioning

Li Boqing, former district chief of the 16th District of this city, and his wife, Gao Palian (the current principal of Qinghua Elementary School), were suspected of forging seals, official stamps, and business cards around April of this year, and occupying two houses in the Nanhua New Village on Dixiwei Road, Yuxin Lane, and office space in the Hadong Building, were sued by the owners to the District Prosecutor's Office. They were summoned for questioning the other day. Li Boqing and his wife Gao Palian appeared in response to the summons. It was claimed that the forged seals were not used. Li Boqing was allowed to be released on bail in court, while Gao Palian was reportedly detained. (Hu Guang News Agency)

### Tidbits from the Conference Venue

Everyone admires Mayor Wu's fluent oratory, but when explaining the budget preparation process yesterday, he used "second" too many times. After one "second," there was another "second," making it unclear how many points he was actually making.

The Mayor's punctuality is always commendable. The budget review meeting was scheduled to begin at 9:20 AM yesterday, but he arrived as early as five minutes before 9:00 AM.

The budget review and discussion inevitably involved numbers. A series of hundreds of millions, tens of thousands, how much increase, how much decrease, what percentage, how many times - those who spoke had to speak, and those who listened grew weary. Journalists especially felt the pain. However, don't underestimate these tedious numbers, as they will affect the changes in the income and expenditure of every family in Shanghai in the near future.

Lu Shidao wanted the Municipal Government to interfere less. He gave an example, saying that it would be better to run a legitimate entertainment venue than to catch gambling. Someone in the audience commented, "I think not catching them is more effective than an entertainment venue!"

Tao Baichuan issued another warning yesterday, saying, "The taxes in Shanghai now (referring to banquet taxes and entertainment taxes) are taken from the pockets of those who dance on volcanoes!"

When Ji Yun discussed the issue of opening the racetrack, he said, "Saying we'll take it back in two years is just fooling children!"

There is a vast difference in the speaking skills of the councilors. The excellent ones are engrossing and captivating. The lengthy and verbose ones are unpleasant to hear. Yesterday, a certain councilor recited his previously written speech against horse racing, and even when the allotted time was up, he refused to stop, prompting many councilors in the audience to applaud him down.

Yesterday, the newspapers sent out a lot of complimentary copies. There was a large pile on every table, but the reporters' seats were completely missing. The reporters had to "guerilla" everywhere, giving the feeling that "reporters are not as important as newspapers."

### Crisis in Chinese Tea Exports, Appeal for Swift and Effective Relief, Tea Associations Send Letters to the Municipal Council and Chamber of Commerce, Four Proposals Requesting Government Adoption

The China Tea Industry Association, Shanghai Tea Export Association, Shanghai Tea Trade Commercial Guild, and other organizations, in order to call for saving the tea crisis, have sent letters to the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Chamber of Commerce, putting forward four proposals requesting to be conveyed to the government. Their telegram stated: "Publicly to the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Chamber of Commerce, tea is a special product of our country, with the same glorious history as silk. Since ancient times, it has been sold to Europe and the United States, not only related to the source of profit, but also representing Chinese culture and civilization, with a long-standing reputation in the world. Since the Anti-Japanese War, the rural areas have been devastated and transportation has been blocked. Not only have groups of tea disappeared from overseas markets, but also domestic sales have gradually decreased due to transportation obstruction. Now that victory has arrived, domestic production costs have increased sharply, and transportation conditions have still not improved much. Recently, the government revised the Goods Tax Regulations and included tea, imposing ad valorem tax. Upon hearing this, we are deeply apprehensive.

Levying Goods Tax, Suffering Actual Harm First

Considering that Chinese tea has always been exempt from consolidated tax and export tax, but the payment of business tax, income tax, stamp duty, etc., is already heavy. Moreover, due to rising domestic costs, international price limits have not been removed, and the price difference between domestic and foreign markets is becoming increasingly distant. The international tea market is very competitive. For example, the United Kingdom restricts the import quantity of Chinese tea, the United States restricts the price of Chinese tea, and the French government's import ban on Chinese tea has not been lifted, all of which are major obstacles to the future of Chinese tea exports. In addition, the impact of domestic prices makes it impossible to reduce costs. Even calculating based on the revised exchange rate, the actual benefit to tea exports is very small. Because before the exchange rate adjustment, the overseas tea price was only one-third of the domestic cost. After the adjustment, it is still less than half of the cost. Now the government is taking steps to abolish export taxes, encourage exports, and compete for international markets. Both at home and abroad are paying attention. How could we know that tea exports originally had no export tax, but when tea is in extreme difficulty, a new tea goods tax is suddenly levied? This results in not enjoying any illusory benefits and suffering actual harm first, further increasing the burden on tea farmers, industrialists, and merchants, and promoting the total collapse of the tea industry.

Tea Farmers Lack Funds, Chopping and Digging Up Tea Gardens

Our colleagues are concerned about the real difficulties of tea after the war, and in view of the importance of timely export of Chinese tea to compete for the market, as early as October last year, we formulated a plan, calling on the authorities to set a tea policy early, raise the necessary funds, and avoid missing the opportunity. However, after running around calling for help, it was not until early May that the Four Banks Joint Office allocated special funds, designating the China Farmers Bank to provide tea loans for relief. Although the China Farmers Bank authorities quickly planned and assisted in many ways, the amount of tea loans was still insufficient to meet the demand, resulting in tea merchants still having to turn to high-interest loans. Costs are increasing, and funds are lacking. To this day, they have not been able to refine the tea into boxes for export and sale. There is even less ability to purchase summer tea. Tea farmers in the producing areas lack funds for harvesting and processing, enduring the waste of goods on the ground, and further chopping and digging up tea gardens, destroying the life of the national tea that has been around for thousands of years. It is foreseeable that Chinese tea will be forever lost in the international market. Our association and colleagues, seeing the crisis and not allowing ourselves to sit idly by, have jointly elected representatives to go to Beijing to present the actual difficulties to the National Government and various ministries and commissions, requesting immediate and effective relief, but to this day, it has not been adopted and implemented. Now that the situation is becoming more urgent, we cannot wait. Our association and colleagues, while there is still a breath left, cannot bear that historical products will fall into ruin. We respectfully present the various points that our colleagues hope from the government as follows:

Grant Subsidies to Encourage Exports

(1) Grant export subsidies to encourage exports. Countries around the world often adopt an export subsidy system to expand or maintain the overseas market of a certain commodity in order to reward or subsidize merchants. For example, India is a British territory, and the government has also processed tea export subsidies because the overseas tea price is lower than the cost. If our government's measures are not as good as the Indian government's, how can we treat our people well at home and rank among the world's powers abroad? The reason why tea cannot be exported now is entirely due to the sales price difference formed by the cost and the officially set exchange rate. Therefore, the government should handle export subsidies to assist tea merchants. This subsidy can be adjusted by graded exchange rates or paid by the national treasury. If limited by the budget, it can be supplemented by adding import duties on ten kinds of items, such as luxury goods and non-essential goods, and then using the income to subsidize tea exports, which is the most rational and simplest incentive method.

Barter Tea for Materials

(2) Continue to barter tea for materials. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, the government bartered tea with the Soviet Union and stationed in the United States to support sales in North Africa, achieving considerable results. This barter method is most suitable for the Soviet Union, which controls international trade. In the past, when the government unified the purchase of foreign tea for export during the Anti-Japanese War, the foreign tea price was very high, and all the foreign exchange profits of the tea merchants were contributed to the government. At that time, in order to enhance the strength of the Anti-Japanese War, they were generous in their donations. Now, tea exports have stagnated, but the Soviet Union needs a large number of boxed tea. It is urgent to restore the barter with the Soviet Union to expand foreign sales. For example, French North Africa also needs a large number of Chinese tea. If we ask the French government to exchange it for Annam's rice and coal, or seek mutual exchange of cotton and tea with the Egyptian government. This kind of barter method can directly encourage the exchange of goods between the two countries, and indirectly increase the supply of rice and coal and stabilize domestic prices.

Economic Diplomacy to Expand Markets

(3) Use economic diplomacy to expand markets. There are currently some countries with customs regulations that are not conducive to Chinese tea, such as the United Kingdom restricting the import quantity of Chinese tea this year to 2.5 million pounds, which is only 20% of the amount of Chinese tea exported to the UK in 1937. The United States, on the other hand, restricts prices, so the price limit on Chinese tea is extremely low. Also, such as Casablanca, the center of the North African green tea market, which is the largest market for Chinese green tea, the French government has an order prohibiting the import of Chinese tea. It is proposed that the government negotiate with these countries through diplomatic channels to remove the above-mentioned restrictions in order to expand the Chinese tea market. In addition, such as Casablanca, the center of the African green tea market, there is no consulate, and tea merchants are greatly hindered in trade due to the lack of guidance and connection. We also request to increase the consulate as soon as possible to protect and facilitate promotion.

Reduce Costs to Promote Sales

(4) Exempt goods tax to reduce costs. From 1940 to 1941, the government once "tried to levy unified tea tax, but at that time, foreign tea was still under control, so it was limited to domestic tea. Later, because the domestic tea market was very narrow, the levy was cumbersome and detailed, and tea merchants could not bear the burden, so they were exempted from the unified tea tax. Now, the situation of domestic and foreign tea sales is more difficult than during the war, and the rural economy is becoming more bankrupt. The government is supporting it in many ways, fearing that it is too late. If we add tea tax, increase the burden, increase the cost, and make it hopeless to export, the domestic sales will be stagnant, which will only make tea farmers and merchants deeper in the water and hotter in the fire, with little benefit and no benefit to the country. Therefore, if we want to dredge tea sales, we must first reduce costs, and exempting tea goods tax is also to first show the purpose of advocating. We have always admired your council's representation of public opinion, safeguarding production, and long-standing enthusiasm. Therefore, we dare to present the actual situation, telegramly urge you to convey the truth to the government, and unanimously call for it to be adopted as soon as possible to save the tea industry crisis. We cannot suppress our expectation. Chairman of the China Tea Industry Association, Li Shoujingwei, Shanghai Tea Association Chairman Tang Jiyin, Shanghai Tea Trade Commercial Guild Chairman Huang Yantang, Shanghai Tea Industry Commercial Guild Chairman Zheng Jianyuan Qiantuo, Shen Xian."

They reviewed the investigation work in Fujian and Taiwan provinces and organized the investigation report to be submitted to the central government. It is said that Supervisory Commissioner Yang Lianggong will leave Shanghai for Beijing today to report on his work.

### Minzhi Nation-Building Society, Another Hongmen Organization Established

[Our Dispatch] The Hongmen has long been an organization with a long history in our country, but because all activities are not open to the public, the people of the country do not know much about its actual situation. Among the overseas Chinese in the United States, Hongmen brothers account for the vast majority. They strongly assisted the Father of the Nation during the Xinhai Revolution and actively donated during the Anti-Japanese War, and their position is naturally important. After the victory, overseas Chinese leaders Situ Meitang and Zhu Jiazhao returned to China together, wanting to make further practical efforts for national affairs. Shanghai then held the Hongmen Global Relatives Conference, and Situ Meitang and others had the intention of establishing the Zhi Gong Party, which they had established overseas two years earlier, in the country. They also met with the Chairman. Due to various reasons, it was renamed the Minzhi Party, and they invited reporters a month ago to formally announce its establishment. As for the political program, it focuses on economic development, state-owned enterprises, and safeguarding private enterprises. The main people in charge are Situ Meitang, Zhu Jiazhao, and Zhao Yu, claiming to have more than three million members.

However, yesterday morning, another Minzhi Nation-Building Society held a meeting at the Tianpo Stage. It is also a Hanmen organization, responsible persons are Liu Huimin, Cui Conglai, Lin Youmin, Xu Junwu, Liu Chengzi, Long Xiangsan, Ding Ziheng, Tang Mouwu, Jiang Shijiang, etc., claiming to have 70,000 members, with the principle of "obeying the Five Ancestor's legacy, promoting the national spirit, practicing the Three People's Principles, and completing nation-building and unification," and the purpose of "establishing life responsibilities, respecting people's interests, stabilizing social order, and protecting human freedom." The meeting also passed a telegram of respect to the Chairman.

### Béthouart to Fly to Shanghai Today

General Béthouart, head of the French Military Advisory Group in Japan, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday on Marshal MacArthur's special plane and then transfer to Japan, but due to bad weather, it has been rescheduled to come here today (the 16th). He will land at Longhua Airport. The time of arrival at the airport is not yet known, but it is expected to be in the afternoon. If the weather is still bad today, it may be delayed by another day.

### Sun Zuji, Zhang Lianfang, Etc. to be Tried Today in the Morning and Afternoon

[Our Dispatch] Gao Rao will try the two traitors Xue Gengcui and Sun Zuji this morning. In the afternoon, he will try Zhang Lianfang, Chen Jiufeng, Chen Jinsheng, Zhou Songping, Zhao Riliang, and other cases.

### Road Bureau Embezzlement Case, Zhang Bokang Makes a Strong Defense

[Taibao News] The road bureau material department embezzlement trial, the district court has set the opening for the 20th morning. Zhang Bokang, one of the main criminals and the purchasing section chief, believes that there are two reasons for acquittal: (1) In the prosecutor's indictment of the facts of the crime, it is stated that after learning of the embezzlement, he contacted his superiors to collude, which was from the bottom up. However, the reason for the prosecution is that he colluded with his subordinates on orders to embezzle, which is from top to bottom, which is clearly contradictory to the former. (2) He is weak in nature, not strict in his management of subordinates, and easily surrounded and blinded by others. Failure to discover the embezzlement case is a fact, which can only constitute administrative punishment and does not involve the judiciary.

### Military Personnel Riding Trains: Free and Half-Price Measures

The Railway Bureau, in order to give preferential treatment to active military personnel traveling on military business, has recently set the measures for active military personnel purchasing half-price tickets and riding for free. The measures are as follows: (1) On the Beijing-Shanghai Line, trains 51, 52, 53, 54, 57, 58, and on the Shanghai-Nanjing Line, trains 41, 42, 61, 62, 67, 68, special cars will be designated for military personnel. Active military personnel with complete uniforms and insignia may ride for free upon presenting their leave passes and having them stamped by the station military police. (2) In addition to riding the special military cars on the trains listed in the previous article according to the prescribed methods, active military personnel who wish to ride other cars on those trains, as well as trains 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 (excluding sleeping cars), 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76 (,77, 78 on the Beijing-Shanghai Line, and express trains such as 23, 24, 25, 26 on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line, may purchase "military half-price tickets" at half price in cash by presenting their Class A travel permits or leave passes. (3) On the Beijing-Shanghai Line, trains 1, 2, 5, 6, 11, 12 express train sleeping cars, and trains 21, 22 express trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line, since tickets must be sold in advance and seats must be reserved, all passengers must purchase full-price tickets according to regulations. Those using special half-price military tickets must wear military uniforms. If they are wearing plain clothes, they must still pay the difference according to the regulations for ordinary passengers. The above measures will officially take effect today.

### Letter to the Editor

Having read the news item in your esteemed newspaper of September 9th in the local news column concerning the grand gathering "Commemorating the September 8th Victory," which mentioned that Wang Xiaolai and Mrs. Chen Tingrui led the dance, I am extremely astonished. Since the War of Resistance, Tingrui has been far away in the wartime capital, Chongqing, while Yuzhen remained in Shanghai, raising the children and serving her parents-in-law. For five years, she has been overworked with household affairs, her spirit weakened, and she has never left home a single step. She was also unable to attend this commemorative celebration of victory. The information in your esteemed newspaper is based on hearsay and is untrue. Fearing misunderstanding among various circles, I hereby send this letter for correction.

### A Glimpse of the Venereal Disease Prevention Institute - If it can be used well, it is indeed an ideal hospital

[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] Although the Mid-Autumn Festival has passed, the scorching heat remains, with no hint of autumn. The only thing that adorns this season is the Mid-Autumn mooncakes that have gone off the market.

In this summer within autumn, in order to understand the content of the Venereal Disease Prevention Institute, the reporter stepped onto Beile Road for the second time. The midday sun was truly powerful, baking the asphalt road until it was soft and cottony. With a heart full of enthusiasm, I put everything behind me, forgetting the scorching sun overhead and the empty stomach.

Stepping into the gate of the Venereal Disease Prevention Institute, I was greeted by nurse Qu Shuyu, who said the first sentence: "Oh, I'm really sorry, Doctor Dong Baoji has gone out again. Only he knows about the matters here." Because the reporter didn't want to come for a third time, I continued by saying, "It doesn't matter, I can wait for Doctor Dong and take a look around."

So Miss Qu led the reporter into an office and presented a piece of paper with the statistics of prostitute examinations, totaling from January to mid-August. Among the 2,473 individuals who were examined, only 893 were issued licenses after passing the examination. The general knowledge level of ordinary prostitutes is very low, and even if they have venereal diseases, they avoid seeking medical treatment. Their visits for examination are entirely due to the coercion of the police station, and most believe that it is not necessary. According to Miss Qu, some cases are more serious, spreading to the legs and forming a limp. After injections, medication, and long-term treatment, they can walk again. One of them even said that this was the result of burning incense and worshiping Buddha. Then, Miss Qu told the reporter many stories about the tragic lives of these sellers of flesh. Their willingness to engage in this lowly occupation is almost entirely due to the lash of life. Many more are because their husbands died in battle, leaving them unable to take care of the children. So the mothers sell themselves to raise their children. There are also many who are deceived and trafficked into hell. For example, when a father dies and there is no money for the funeral, the uncle sells the underage girl into a brothel, collecting 500,000 yuan. And this inherent, pure soul has no choice but to corrode with the years, little by little contracting the most deadly venereal diseases.

The tragic and horrifying stories told by Miss Qu are unimaginable to those living in paradise. Just as the reporter was listening attentively, the central figure of this news—Doctor Dong Baoji—arrived. The reporter was naturally overjoyed, because Miss Qu had said that only Doctor Dong knew the actual situation and future plans of the institute. But unexpectedly, Doctor Dong did not seem interested in the reporter's visit. When the reporter asked him about future plans, he said, "The current Venereal Disease Prevention Institute is unable to expand due to insufficient materials and funding. In the future, we hope to manage venereal diseases in a regulated manner and bring them onto the right track." After this observation, one thing that must be reported to the readers is the exquisite building construction of the Venereal Disease Prevention Institute. The tall, Western-style house is decorated with white tiles on all four walls. The equipment inside is very perfect. Such a well-built prevention institute, if it can be used well, is truly the most ideal. When the reporter went downstairs from the third floor (the prostitute examination area), there were doors everywhere, and it was impossible to find an exit. Suddenly, an old woman with fiercely raised eyebrows shouted at the reporter, "Go this way!" Under her guidance, I silently left the Venereal Disease Prevention Institute, unable to help but secretly gasp for the prostitutes who were seeking treatment! The image shows prostitutes being injected with a special drug for venereal diseases (photographed by this newspaper).

### Hang Weihan and Others Inspect Seawalls: South Seawall Project Completed, North Seawall Under Construction

The seawall project in this city has been under active construction for less than two months, and the initial stage has been completed. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, Wang Bianshan, Deputy Director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, Zhu Guoxi, Zhu Qingyu, Deputy Captains of the Seawall Engineering Team, Yu Zihou, Consulting Engineer of the Municipal Transport, accompanied Hang Weihan, member of the Party and Government Work Assessment Committee of the National Defense Council, and invited municipal councilors to inspect the status of the seawall project in Gaoqiao. The councilors were unable to participate because they were reviewing proposals yesterday. During this inspection, the 221-meter breach at Zhangjia Village on the south seawall, and the 1,244 meters at Daijiazhai, Lujiazhai, and Zhoujiazhai were all repaired. The above villages will be safe from the tide today. Deputy Director Wang expressed his sincere appreciation to the hardworking seawall workers. Regarding the north seawall, it is currently under construction, and a deadline has been set for completion. Commissioner Hang inquired about the details of the project, and Chief Captain Zhu answered each question. They returned to Shanghai at 4:00 PM.

### Air Force Preparing to Establish a Large-Scale Supply Organization in Shanghai

New organizations under the Air Force Headquarters are being established step by step. It is learned that the Air Force Supply Headquarters, which oversees supply matters for the entire army, has begun preparations in Shanghai. Deputy Commander Colonel Hao Zhonghe has led his subordinates to Shanghai to oversee the establishment of the camp and takeover matters. Once the headquarters is established, the temporary material receiving agencies in various locations will be closed. Therefore, the organization of the headquarters is quite large, with six sections, three offices, and four independent divisions. The heads of the various subordinate units have already been internally determined. The preparatory work is expected to be largely completed by the end of this month. It is said that Commander Wang Weimin will come to Shanghai to take charge in early next month.

### Students from Six Reinstated Universities, Including Chongqing University, Request Admission from the Ministry of Education. They Held a Reception for Reporters in Nanjing Yesterday to Report on the Process

[News from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 15th] Representatives of reinstated students from six universities, including Chongqing University, Sichuan University, Guizhou University, Yunnan University, Guizhou Medical College, and Guizhou Normal College, held a reception for reporters at 10:00 AM on the 15th to report on their request for admission from the Ministry of Education. They believe that the Ministry of Education lacks concern for the issue of seeking education after their return home, and if they did not urge them, even the "participate in the examination" promise would not be obtained. The relevant responsible persons of the Ministry of Education all shirked responsibility, using the excuse that the capacity of the reinstated universities was full, overturning the promises made in Chongqing of "transfer by order of the Ministry" and "equivalent to distribution by order of the Ministry." They believe that if the "capacity is truly full," the examination is simply a deception, and the date of the examination is still uncertain. Chongqing University will start school on the 20th, and Guizhou University on the 28th, causing concerns of being left out twice. After holding a plenary meeting of representatives on the 16th, they will meet with Minister Zhu, requesting two things: (1) Maintain the original proposal, distribute transfers to various universities. If academic review is required, it should be the same standard as the distribution of the Temporary University (70 points or above). (2) Because the matter is unresolved, causing excessive absenteeism from the original school, making it difficult to return to the original school, the ministry should be responsible for finding a solution. They told reporters that they really do not want to use strikes and parades as a means to achieve their goals like the students of the Temporary University, and hope that the Ministry of Education can accept their reasonable requests.

### Zhejiang Provincial Councilors Suggest Actively Promoting Education, Increasing the Percentage of the Education Budget

[News from Our Newspaper in Hangzhou] At the meeting of the Zhejiang Provincial Council, some councilors suggested actively promoting the province's education, and the measures are: (1) Increase the number of national schools, striving to achieve the goal of one school per district, and in accordance with regulations, open adult classes and women's classes. (2) Universally establish secondary schools and vocational schools, and add classes and expand enrollment as much as possible. (3) Guarantee the livelihood of teachers and improve teacher qualifications. (4) Pay special attention to the cultivation of children's character and physical training. (5) Increase the number of publicly funded students to 20% to 30%. (6) Appropriately reduce tuition and miscellaneous fees and stipulate installment payment methods to lighten the burden on families. (7) Increase the percentage of education budget for provinces, cities, and counties. (8) Intensify the movement to donate funds for schools and determine the method of raising regular expenses for national schools. (9) The government continues to handle student loans to help poor students enter school.

### University Students in Chengdu Compete to Become Police Officers

[News from Chengdu] The local water police station is recruiting police officers, and the number of applicants is very enthusiastic. Among the more than 500 students who applied, university students accounted for one-tenth, high school graduates accounted for four-tenths, and junior high school graduates accounted for five-tenths, breaking the unprecedented record of police quality. According to the person in charge of the station: it is gratifying that university and high school students are participating in the police force this time, but it is feared that they are temporarily seeking a livelihood due to economic pressure and do not have a sincere and long-term commitment to police work. Once there is another way, they may not resign immediately, which is also worrying.

### Recent News on Student Loans

The National Goods Market Concludes Its Meeting Today, Zhang Xipeng Generously Donates 1 Million Yuan Yesterday

The National Goods Market sponsored by the Shanghai Education Loan Committee concluded on the 5th. Some procedures for various manufacturers and schools have not yet been cleared, so the number could not be announced as scheduled. However, as of now, approximately 256 million yuan in cash has been received. The current Economic Management Committee has scheduled a closing meeting for today (the 16th) to determine the loan amount based on manufacturer commissions. In addition, some universities and secondary schools responsible for sales, such as Zhen Dan, Daxia, St. John's, Huxin, Yuying, Minli, Xinben, China, Sino-French, Tongyi, Xingwu, and China Vocational, have not yet submitted the cash and remaining coupons obtained from sales. It is reported that the committee has sent letters to the above schools urging them to settle accounts by a specific date. It is estimated that the committee's total income will be settled and announced within a few days.

Loan Principles Slightly Changed

Also reported: The investigation and review work for loan applicants has been completed. Currently, because Wang Zhengjun, the director of the review department of the committee, is attending the National Congress of the Youth League, it will be announced and notified to various schools after Wang returns to Shanghai within a few days and makes the final decision. However, according to the person in charge of the committee: in addition to a poor family as a basic condition, service performance is the most important factor in approving or not approving this loan, and 80% of the funds raised by each school will be used as the loan principle for that school. The committee believes that the funds raised this time are far from the original target. In addition to sending a letter to the Sports Association to hold charity sports competitions, it is currently approaching enthusiastic education supporters from all sectors of society to solicit donations. Tong Xipeng of Chengde and Co. generously donated 1 million yuan yesterday, which is deeply admirable.

Can Apply to the Schools Attended

It is heard that approximately 10,000 impoverished students in this city have applied to the Education Loan Committee for loans. The income of the committee for this loan is very small and difficult to meet the needs. Therefore, the tuition fee problem of the loan students this semester has attracted the attention of people from all walks of life. It is now learned that most of the loan students studying at private schools in this city have obtained the school's free tuition permission, and those who have not obtained free tuition can still apply to the schools they attend.

### Sino-French University Renamed Zhihui University, Advocated by Li Shizeng, Zhang Jingjiang, and Others

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] Li Shizeng, who was entrusted in Beiping, told reporters: Sino-French University will be renamed Zhihui University according to the world university opinion advocated by him and Zhang Jingjiang, and Zhihui University will also be established in Shanghai. Regarding the Atomic Research Institute of the Beiping Research Institute, it should only study atomic energy and atomic bombs, and should be studied by military agencies.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] According to Yun Zheng, the director of the Overseas Chinese Education Research Institute of Zhihui University in the United States: Zhihui University in New York has four departments: the World College, the World Cooperation College, the Independent Chinese Linguistics Department, and the Overseas Chinese Education Research Institute. It will also establish a Chinese Culture College, with more than 200 students, mostly American. The Overseas Chinese Education Research Institute has an attached primary school with 300 students, mostly children of Bi.

### Hu Shi Expresses His Opinion: The Guidance System Should Not Control Thought, The Engineering and Medical Schools Should Each Extend the Term of Years

[News from Our Newspaper in Beiping] Dr. Hu Shi, the president of Peking University, recently expressed his opinion to reporters: Peking University's establishment of a five-year system for the School of Engineering and a seven-year system for the School of Medicine is based on the ministry's instructions. According to the ministry's order, the School of Medicine can be run for six to eight years. Because the courses and learning requirements of general engineering and medical schools are too many, they are each extended by one year. There will be no discussion of a six-year system for the Department of Law this year, but it is also necessary to extend it for the need for research. Extending the term of years must, of course, be reported to the ministry for record. As for the issue of the guidance system, Peking University has established a Guidance Committee. My personal opinion is that the guidance system should not be used to control students' thoughts and restrict students. In fact, it is not easy to achieve the effect of restriction. If it is used to guide and help students in terms of physical fitness, knowledge, and behavior, the meaning of the guidance system can be brought into play. The Guidance Committee is currently drafting measures.

### Hao Gengsheng's Inspection Report: The Situation of Education in the Northeast, Japanese Professors Expressed Their Willingness to Lower Their Salaries Because They Are from a Defeated Country, Xu Songming Expressed That Academics Have No Borders, and There Should Be No Distinction in the Treatment of Professors

[News from Our Newspaper in Nanjing] Hao Gengsheng, a supervisor appointed by the Ministry of Education, recently prepared and submitted a report to the Ministry of Education on the situation of education in the Northeast after his inspection. The following is an excerpt from the inspection report:

Has a Practice Forest with an Area of 10,000 Hectares

(1) National Northeast University: The original school buildings of the school were occupied by the Japanese army as barracks before the September 18th Incident. At the beginning of the victory last year, guest troops were stationed in, and soon withdrew. When the national army did not arrive, the local situation was complicated, and nearby people entered the school to plunder. The school's books and teaching equipment were looted. Until recently, unemployed workers occasionally organized house demolition teams, gathering in groups at night. Fortunately, the protection force has now been strengthened to avoid further losses. The large sports field planned and built by Gengsheng in that year was once turned into a horse-raising farm by the Japanese army. All the iron fences and iron gates in the field were transported back by the Japanese army to be made into military supplies. After the restoration, many of the school's equipment were taken away. It is said that 50 trucks were used to transport them for six days and nights, and it is estimated that 70% to 80% of all the school buildings were damaged. They are now being repaired to be used when school starts this autumn. The establishment of the school's various colleges is still in line with the ministry's instructions. The Colleges of Liberal Arts, Law, Science, and Engineering will be restored to their original locations. The College of Agriculture plans to use the school buildings of the Agricultural University run by the puppet Manchukuo. The entire college covers an area of about 100 hectares, with complete equipment such as cattle sheds and horse stables. In addition, there is a practice forest in Linjiang County, Jilin, covering an area of 10,000 hectares, accounting for half of the county's area. The total cost of repairing the school is estimated to be 200 million yuan in negotiable securities, which the school has submitted to the ministry.

The Directors are Working Hard, and the Situation is Still Good

(2) Preparatory Class of Northeast University: The class has more than 3,450 students, including more than 630 girls. These students come from more than 260 middle schools, with complex sources and varying levels. Fortunately, the environment is still good. Some Japanese houses outside the school have been used as dormitories, and the students' lives have been stabilized. The main courses are Chinese, English, each five hours; Civics, Geography, History, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, each two hours; Music one hour, Physical Education two hours. The Literature and History group has two more hours of Chinese, and the Physics and Chemistry group has two more hours of Mathematics. There are more than 110 teachers and staff members, of which about 50 are staff members. Thanks to the efforts of the directors, the situation is still good.

One Died of Cholera, One Died of Lung Disease

(3) Shenyang Temporary University Tutoring Class: The class has more than 3,000 students, and more than 160 units are from schools above junior college. Students have different academic qualifications, so the levels are also inconsistent, and teaching is quite difficult. In addition, because there are so many students, dormitories and dining halls are problems. Currently, part of the Shenyang Medical College's school buildings are being borrowed. When the inspection was conducted, one student died of cholera, and another died of lung disease. The school has 800 to 900 students from 14 units of universities and junior colleges in the puppet Manchukuo. Recently, feeling that the environment is not suitable, they have requested the class to allow them to leave Pan Yang and go to Changchun to wait for the establishment of the Changchun University. Therefore, it is not easy for everything in the class to get on track. As for the funding, up to the beginning of July this year, only 20 million yuan in national currency was received from the headquarters.

800 Microscopes Still Remain

(4) National Shenyang Medical College: Formerly the Manchurian Medical University, it is divided into four departments: the University Department, the Specialized Department, the Preparatory Department, and the Pharmaceutical Specialty Department. It has a long history and a solid foundation. Currently, in terms of teachers and staff members, in addition to the Japanese who preside over the Pharmaceutical Specialty, who has been dismissed for improper conduct, most of the Japanese teachers with good experiences will be retained. The school has 43 Japanese professors, associate professors, and lecturers, and 47 Chinese associate professors. There is also an affiliated hospital, with 21 Chinese nurses, 109 Japanese nurses, 23 Japanese staff members, 5 pharmacists, 12 hospital police, and 120 workers. The school's equipment is quite complete. Taking microscopes as an example, 70 of them were taken away at the beginning of the victory, and 800 are still left. The affiliated hospital originally had 800 beds, and 400 of them were also taken away during the restoration. In the past few months, because there was no formal director, many minor problems occurred in the school. Recently, President Xu Songming took office, and the school's administration has a center, and everything is gradually getting on track. Many experienced Japanese professors are willing to stay at the school to teach, and said that because they are professors from a defeated country, their treatment should not be equal to that of Chinese professors. However, President Xu believes that academics have no borders, and there should be no distinction in the treatment of professors. Currently, all aspects of the school are harmonious and stable. The school's funding for this year, from April to July, received 9.5 million yuan in negotiable securities. Salaries of 3 million yuan are paid out every month and have been issued three times. The repair of all houses, the repair of walls, and the cleaning of waterways cost tens of thousands of yuan in negotiable securities. Currently, the funding is extremely tight. The hospital's income was initially only more than 3,000 yuan in negotiable securities per day, but recently it can receive more than 20,000 yuan per day. Regarding the process of changing the name of Shenyang Railway Medical College to National Shenyang Medical College, and issues such as academic system reform and financial assistance, President Xu has another detailed report that has been submitted to the ministry for review.

Teachers and Staff Serve with Undiminished Spirit

(5) Liaoning Medical College: Formerly known as the Xiaheyan Missionary Hospital, it is a private church school. It was founded by Sir Stockwell, an Englishman, in Shenyang in the eighth year of Guangxu. After several changes, it was renamed Liaoning Medical College. The equipment is fairly complete. Fortunately, the people concerned in the school have made every effort to maintain and coordinate it, so it has not been destroyed. There are currently 179 students in the school, including 38 girls. The funding for the college is gradually declining due to its private nature, but the teachers and staff members serve with undiminished dedication, which is commendable. The medical service provided by the college to the general public in Pan Yang can be described as well-known. The daily cost of food and medicine in the third-class ward is only 80 yuan in negotiable securities, 150 yuan in the second-class ward, and 200 yuan in the first-class ward. This is truly serving the society. The salaries of the college's professors are only 7,000 to 8,000 yuan in negotiable securities per month (ordinary university professors earn about 12,000 yuan per month).

Students Once Protected the School, and the Equipment Was Not Destroyed

(6) Shenyang Teacher Training Institute: The institute is held by the Youth Guidance Office of the Ministry. It is divided into two phases: graduation in three months and graduation in six months. There are more than 300 male students and about 70 female students. The funding is short and insufficient. The teaching at the institute adopts the methods and system of the Central Training Corps, and the spiritual performance and teaching equipment are still good. (7) Shenyang Youth Guidance Office Middle School Remedial Class: It is also held by the Youth Guidance Office of the Ministry, with more than 720 students, including about 90 girls. The monthly funding is also insufficient. The class address is the former site of the South Manchurian Middle School (the Japanese paid great attention to the school because it used to train lower-level staff of the South Manchurian Railway). About 280 students from the original South Manchurian Middle School transferred to the class and launched a school protection movement. The school's equipment has not been destroyed, and the English level of the original South Manchurian Middle School students is better in the class. The class has complete physics and chemistry equipment. The principal of the South Manchurian Middle School was Japanese and studied in the United States.

### City Education Bureau Proposes Organizing Educational Delegation; Drafts Proposal for City Council Resolution

The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, in order to revitalize the city's education and continuously strive for improvement, urgently plans to organize an educational delegation for mutual learning. Therefore, it has drafted a proposal for the City Council to resolve. The content of the proposal is recorded below:

Reasoning

Shanghai is the largest port in the East, with well-developed land and sea transportation. Its educational and cultural undertakings have always held a leading position in the country. Currently, international cultural exchange is frequent, and educational systems are rapidly changing. To revitalize the city's education, it is essential to meet international trends, adapt to the times, learn from foreign countries, absorb new ideas, and continuously make reasonable and effective improvements. Only then can the power of education be brought into play, and the spirit of national culture can be promoted. The Bureau, recognizing this, proposes to organize a foreign educational delegation. Every year or every two years, a delegation will be sent abroad for investigation, and reports will be compiled on the new systems in education and new measures in cultural undertakings in various countries, so that they can be adopted and implemented. This will allow the city's education to be continuously improved and become a model for education nationwide.

Measures

(1) The Bureau will hire prominent figures from the city's education and cultural circles to form a foreign educational delegation, and the municipal government will allocate special funds as investigation expenses. (2) The delegation will send members abroad for investigation once every year or every two years, depending on actual needs, for a period of six months to one year. (3) Before going abroad, the delegation must prepare an investigation plan and submit it to the Bureau for approval. After returning to the country, it should prepare a report on the actual situation of the investigation and suggestions for reform and submit it to the Bureau for adoption and implementation.

### Liangjiang Reopens in Jiangwan; Jiangwan Weidemai Road (formerly Yinxiang Road)

Liangjiang Junior High School, formerly Liangjiang Women's Physical Education College, was largely destroyed by artillery fire during the August 13th Shanghai Battle and has been suspended for nine years. Principal Lu Lihua, after returning to Shanghai from Chongqing, immediately prepared for the reopening. The original school buildings that were not destroyed have been returned by military and political organs. This semester, only the junior high school will be opened, and the physical education department will be restored next year. The school is located in the suburbs, with quiet scenery suitable for study. It has school buses to pick up and drop off commuting students. The teachers hired are all knowledgeable scholars. The entrance examination is scheduled to be held on the 17th at the Municipal Stadium, and the school will open on the 22nd.

### Ningbo Association School Demands the Return of Property from Lin Da

The Fair Road campus of the Second Elementary School affiliated with the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow-Provincials Association was occupied by enemy forces after the National Army retreated west and was converted into a Japanese elementary school. After the victory, it was taken over by the Ministry of Education and lent to Lin Da, which in turn lent it to the Teacher Training Institute. Now that the Teacher Training Institute is about to end, not only has there been no news of its return, but Lin Da has also lent it to Ji Da for use as a business school without authorization. However, the association's elementary schools are in great need of school buildings, and many students from the same province are unable to attend school, which is highly inconsistent with the situation. Yesterday at 2 p.m., the parent-teacher conference jointly organized by the association's elementary schools specifically and jointly protested the forced occupation of the school buildings by Lin Da, requesting assistance from all sectors to immediately return them in order to reopen the school. It is reported that the Enemy Property Management Bureau has approved the return and has sent an official letter to the association.

### Professor Pei Fei Gives Lecture at Tongji; To Prevent Science from Destroying Humanity, More Research Should be Done on Human Relationships

[Reported by this newspaper] Dr. Pei Fei, a famous professor from Columbia University in the United States, was recently invited by Dr. Dong Xifan to give a lecture at Tongji University in this city, stating that: In the past two hundred years, the world's science has made extremely rapid progress. This is the result of research on things and matter, but to this day, research on human relationships remains in a very primitive era. We should strive to do more research, otherwise humanity will be destroyed by the science that is researched. Chinese science is still in a stage before the 1950s. In addition to actively creating scientists and engineering experts, we should pay more attention to social sciences to prevent humanity from being destroyed by abnormal development. Confucius and Mencius' philosophy more than two thousand years ago was a study of human relationships, and now we should do more research to keep pace with Einstein. However, Dr. Pei Fei repeatedly stated that he does not ignore the importance of natural sciences, but hopes that the audience will not ignore social sciences either, which won enthusiastic applause from the audience.

### Stock Exchange Officially Opens Today; Yesterday Hosted Journalists to Explain the Reform Situation

[Reported by this newspaper] The Securities Exchange is scheduled to officially open at 10 a.m. today, temporarily only conducting morning market trading, from 10 a.m. to 12 noon every day. At 5 p.m., collective reconciliation will be held. All details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., the Securities Exchange Authority held a tea party to entertain the press in this city. The general manager of the exchange, Wang Zhixin, assistant managers Yang Yinbo and Gu Meichang, chief secretary Hua Wenyu, manager Chen Jixun, deputy general managers Zhang Jisan and Shen Renzan, and other important officials, as well as more than 30 reporters from various newspapers, attended. During the meeting, General Manager Wang introduced the important officials of the exchange one by one and said: "I am very honored that you are here today. Since the opening of the exchange on September 9, we have been practicing trading and reconciliation procedures, and waiting for the government to issue the transaction tax collection methods and approve the method of paying part of the broker's security deposit with substitutes. At the latest, we will be able to officially open for trading on the 16th. Today, we are holding a meeting to explain the various procedures of the exchange and listen to your opinions. This year's system equipment has been carefully referenced and decided upon beforehand, and I believe it is forward-looking. There may be some unfamiliarity at the beginning, but I firmly believe that we will be able to achieve agility and accuracy."

Renovations were made to both the trading floor and the calculations.

Assistant Manager Yang continued: "The Business Department has a direct relationship with the opening of trading tomorrow (the 16th). The Trading Floor Department is responsible for the actual market transactions; the Calculation Department is responsible for the clearing of brokers' trades on the same day, so that settlement can be executed the next day. This time, due to the increase in the number of brokers, many of the old equipment and methods need to be added and revised to adapt to the actual needs."

In terms of the trading floor, the most important reform is the adoption of "counter-to-counter trading." This method was formulated by the Preparatory Committee after careful research and consideration. Because in the case of a sharp increase in the number of participants, failing to increase the trading location would be insufficient to cope. The main purpose of the counter is to decentralize the trading location to increase the trading area. Replacing the straight line with a circle, and replacing concentration with counters, the Preparatory Committee's method of maximizing limited location is indeed a major advancement. However, this method is not exactly the same as the ordinary counter-to-counter trading adopted by the former "Chinese Securities Brokers" and the blackboard system adopted by the "Public Association of Industries." Although it may be slightly inconvenient due to unfamiliarity and lack of practice at the first trial, it is also a necessary process in the reform. After several exercises and some improvements, trading has been able to proceed smoothly. Improvements include: (1) Increasing the size of the numbers written on the "market price board" in the four corners of the market. (2) The "market price board" rewrites the buying and selling prices. (3) The blackboards added to the trading counters simultaneously announce the buying and selling market prices. (4) Adjusting the positions of the trading counters for each listed security to make it easier to connect between counters.

In terms of calculation, there have also been reforms in the calculation methods. In the past, all calculation work was done by the exchange after business hours. It required a large number of people (more than 120) to work overnight, and sometimes it was impossible to "square up." Now that the number of brokers has increased several times, the complexity of reconciliation has also increased. Even if the number of calculation personnel is doubled, it is still difficult to cope in practice. Therefore, by referring to the bank check exchange method, a collective reconciliation system is stipulated. Brokers are required to send personnel to gather in the market at the designated time to reconcile accounts on the spot and "square up" the differences. Fortunately, with the cooperation of the brokers, the procedures have gradually become skilled after several days of practice. In short, the business of the exchange is complex and involves thousands of threads. With today's limited material conditions, we can only gradually seek continuous improvement, and we hope that you will give us more guidance.

Review Standards for Fluctuation Limits

The Exchange's General Manager Wang and Manager Yang answered questions raised by the newspapers as follows: (1) Listed stocks must be applied for and approved before they can be listed. This time, a total of 20 types have been approved. The standard is that the content of the stock is solid and it is already circulating in the market, the so-called hot stocks, but all are of a trial listing nature: (2) In order to prevent sharp rises and falls from affecting the entire financial situation, the rise and fall of listed stocks have been approved by the authorities to stipulate the limits. First, for general stock prices below 100 yuan, the rise and fall limit is 20 percent. Second, for those above 100 yuan and below 5,000 yuan, it is 15 percent. Third, for those below 5,000 yuan, it is 10 percent. The rise and fall limit for each stock is posted on the trading counter by the exchange every day. There is only one limit per day. All transaction prices must not be higher than the high price of the announced limit or lower than the low price of the announced limit. If the rise or fall of the securities price reaches this limit, the exchange may apply to stop the trading of some or all securities. The length of time the trading is suspended will depend on the circumstances.

Do Spot Trading First, Settlement the Next Day

Stock trading is divided into two types: spot and term. Before the war, securities trading was mainly term trading, supplemented by spot trading. Today, only spot trading will be conducted. All transactions concluded on the same day must be squared up on the same day and settled on the next day. The buyer must pay the price to the exchange by 12 noon on the next day at the latest, and the seller must submit the securities to the exchange by 3 p.m. on the next day at the latest.

Temporarily Set Handling Fee Collection Rate

The Exchange also issued Stock Market Announcement No. 5, stating: "The collection rate for the Exchange's handling fees is temporarily set as follows: For stock trading handling fees, both brokers will each collect 0.75 per thousand of the value of the goods. When the buying and selling brokers are the same person in each transaction, and for internal transfer transactions, only 0.75 per thousand will be charged." Announcement No. 6 stated: "The commission charged by each broker to the buying and selling principals will be temporarily set at 3 per thousand for stock commissions before the Brokers Association is organized, the commission rate is formulated and reported to the Exchange for approval."

Finally, reporters from various newspapers asked technical questions about trading methods, preventing speculation and manipulation in the exchange, and cracking down on black market trading. General Manager Wang and others answered them one by one based on the exchange's compilation of overviews and operating rules. The meeting ended at around 6 p.m.

### Serious Theft of Passengers and Cargo on the Yangtze River; Shipping Industry Should Be Responsible for Protection; Chamber of Commerce Earnestly Advises Against Individual Merchants' Mocking

[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Seashore Groceries and Northern Goods Commercial Associations, stating that members often purchased products such as wood ear, lotus seeds, pickled mustard, daylily, peach kernels, and various northern goods and groceries from the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River in the Yuyu, Yihan, and Xun areas, and when they were delivered by various shipping companies to Shanghai warehouses, they were often stolen en route. In some cases, as much as 10 to 20 percent was missing, causing merchants to suffer considerable losses. The Chamber of Commerce, according to the situation, separately wrote to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Dada, Sanbei, Minsheng, and other shipping companies, as well as the Shanghai Municipal Port Affairs Management Committee, stating that Article 634 of the Civil Code stipulates that the carrier shall be liable for the loss of goods carried, except for force majeure. Article 97 of the Maritime Law also has the same provisions. Theft is not something that cannot be prevented by human effort, and the shipping company is legally responsible and cannot shirk responsibility with excuses. Even from the perspective of the shipping company's responsibility to serve industry and commerce, on the one hand, it has recovered shipping rights and earnestly appealed to gain the sympathy of the world. On the other hand, it should eliminate long-standing malpractices and set an example to meet the expectations of the industrial and commercial circles. The matter is corresponding and cannot be neglected. Otherwise, it will only sadden the people and be mocked by foreign merchants. Therefore, we earnestly request that your company, etc., with an open and sincere attitude, make a brave expression of responsibility, and admonish employees to effectively stop the evil habit of stealing passengers and cargo en route, and prevent it from happening again after the victory and the recovery of shipping rights.

### When will Government Bonds Open for Trading? Ministry of Finance is Reviewing

After the reopening of the Shanghai Securities Exchange, various industrial securities have been approved, and they will be listed for trading today. However, the date for government bonds to be listed has not yet been announced. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance, at the beginning of the exchange's reopening, the primary purpose of listing industrial securities for trading is to allow industrial funds to circulate and absorb idle funds. The order in which the various government bonds issued before and after the war are listed should be carefully reviewed and determined based on the circumstances of each bond and the state of the market. The exchange has submitted a request for approval in accordance with the General Rules for Listed Securities and its Operating Rules. The types of government bonds to be listed are being carefully reviewed by the Ministry, and as soon as they are determined, the exchange will be notified.

### Counterfeit Ancient Porcelain Criticized by Foreigners

[United Press International, San Francisco, 14th] Australian Radio broadcast today that British sailors from Shanghai said that forged Chinese ancient porcelain is being sold around the world, and only experts can identify such products. This type of fraudulent sale is very popular in China, and unscrupulous merchants are making countless profits.

### Approved for Publication (4): Isolated Zhengyangguan

— Special Dispatch from Zhengyangguan by Our Newspaper's Correspondent Shao Shenzhi, dated August 26th

If you are in a cheerful mood, sitting in the Bund Park and admiring the waves of the Huangpu River, their surging and crashing against the embankment stones, listening to their flute-like sounds that pluck at your heartstrings, your emotions will become even more refined. If you are in a bad mood, it's also not impossible to dispel your worries here. It's a pity that the Huangpu is too narrow, and ships gather like clouds. The noise of the city is too clamorous, and it has already lost its pure natural beauty.

Controlling the Confluence of Seventy-Two Rivers, Only One Square Kilometer Remains

Zhengyangguan is different. Originally, it bordered the Huai River to the north and the Pi River to the west; across the water to the west was the Ying River, all of which are much wider than the Huangpu River. In autumn, the clouds and the sails cast shadows over tens of thousands of acres, stretching as far as the eye can see. Being in that place is truly pleasing to the eye. The various rivers of northwestern Anhui converge and flow east here, said to number as many as seventy-two. Zhengyangguan controls the benefits of the plains and can be described as a "land of fish and rice." Not many places in China can boast of this. It is the only important town in central China that controls the confluence of seventy-two rivers, acting as a hub for trade.

However, ever since the Yellow River diverted its course and flowed east through the Ying River, Zhengyangguan has encountered the same flood disaster it experienced in the 20th year of the Republic (1931). It almost declared total submersion, with not a single piece of farmland visible except for a few buildings. Yesterday, when I arrived here, I took a small boat to the back entrance of a hotel and stepped onto the precious land. I found that Zhengyangguan was surrounded by water on all sides, turning it into an isolated island. The Ying, Huai, and Pi Rivers could no longer be distinguished. At its worst, less than one square kilometer of Zhengyangguan remained above the water. Now, with the water receding, one can walk on the small patch of land, slightly more than one square kilometer, without getting one's feet wet.

Three thousand residents live on this piece of land. I walked along the edge of the water and land, which naturally didn't take much effort. Looking into the distance, the water and sky were the same color. If it weren't for a few rooftops or treetops sticking out of the water, one would almost think that they were on the other side of the sea. As I was walking across a garden—what was said to be the edge of the water and land—the mud, soaked and softened by the water, was over my ankles. The waves crashed in, washing away large patches of mud. The spray reached five or six feet high, and the edge of the land was being eroded like this. The buildings had collapsed brick walls, leaving only leaning roof frames. The scene was truly terrifying, making me tremble with fear that the water would suddenly rise and rush up, leaving no time to escape, and everything would be swept away. I thought that such a large body of water would not find it difficult to swallow this small patch of land, barely more than one square kilometer, in one gulp.

Yellow River Carp Swim Southward, Disaster Victims Humorously Go Fishing

Those children standing next to me, gazing at the distant former homes—now only rooftops visible—were silent. The waves beat against their bodies, cruelly shattering their innocent dreams, leaving them despondent. Small boats, loaded with farmers, bravely navigated the waves to visit their homes. Indeed, all the signs of the villages had been submerged. They lived on the small island that remained, looking up to the sky every day. They didn't think about the government or philanthropists, only hoping that the flood would recede soon, so that they could muster their spirits to struggle for their survival after the disaster. These small island groups were approximately five li apart from each other, or more than ten li in some cases, scattered like stars in the sky. Therefore, standing on this large isolated island of Zhengyangguan, as far as I could see into the "sea," I couldn't see many of the small islands mentioned above. I only saw those brave small boats turning past the green willows, disappearing at the end of the "sea" in an instant.

The beach is only ten meters away from where I am staying. A few days ago, the house was already flooded. The watermark on the wall is still visible. Now that the water has receded slightly, the ground is covered with lime, so I can settle down. However, the "sea" is only ten meters away, and the waves are crashing relentlessly day and night against the brick walls of the house, hitting forty waves per minute. One wall has already collapsed and the attack hasn't stopped.

However, in Zhengyangguan, I ate Yellow River carp, costing four hundred yuan per catty. This, of course, is thanks to "the Yellow River waters coming from the sky." Some residents, because their homes were flooded, could only walk on wooden planks laid over the water. Getting in and out naturally required boats. With nothing to do, they had no choice but to sit at their doorsteps and fish, with a leisurely attitude, truly demonstrating the humor of those who understand life.

Ancient Yangshi Old Pass, Tax Officials Still Carry on the Legacy

Zhengyangguan was formerly known as Yangshi. The "Taizhou Gazetteer" states: "Zhengyangguan is located sixty li southwest of the prefecture. Zhengyang borders the land route, connecting the prefectural city to the east, Liuan Prefecture to the south, Huoqiu County to the southwest, and Hongze Lake to the lower reaches. It was established as a pass in the first year of Chenghua during the Ming Dynasty." According to the "Treatise on Food and Money," "Zhengyangguan was required to collect 62,446 taels, 3 qian, 6 hao, and 5 si of silver in taxes."

Now there is only a tax collection office of the county's commodity tax bureau. But what commodity tax can be collected on this isolated island? Yet, there are nearly twenty staff members, which is irregular. It seems they are not afraid of losing money. When the boat I was on approached Zhengyangguan, a figure dressed in a short jacket and silk trousers jumped onto the boat from a small boat and began searching everywhere, acting extremely nervously. He was randomly touching and asking about everything, frightening the country bumpkins who were panicking and stammering. A gentleman on the boat said to me, "You don't know, they can collect taxes in any way possible. The country bumpkins have no knowledge." Later, I also learned that every shop in Zhengyangguan town has to pay so-called Baojia donations to the town government, depending on the size of the shop front, ranging from 10,000 to 60,000 yuan per month. Are these merchants all country bumpkins? If a stray soldier or vagrant dies of illness, the town government has another excuse to apportion the costs to each household. These merchants always complain first, then comply, and in the end, always pay up.

Only a Circle of City Walls Encloses a Circle of Dry Land

Now, let's return to Zhengyangguan. The pass resembles a two-story drum tower, but unlike drum towers, which usually have city gates beneath them, this one is a platform built of stone blocks, its height equal to half of the entire structure. Stone steps are attached to the outside, allowing one to climb the pass. This historical relic is now naturally very dilapidated, and the stone platform is completely submerged in water. I could only see its front by boat. Now, there is no need to climb the steps, as a boat can be driven right in.

Wang Zhaokui of Quanjiao in the Qing Dynasty wrote a poem "Passing Zhengyang River": "Halting my horse at the pass entrance, I call for a ferry boat; The boat glides like a leaf, the rising water seems to touch the sky. Old houses reveal their roof beams, fish swim among the treetops; A myriad of feelings arise in the vastness, the setting sun descends into the pale mist." This still reflects the scenery today, but at that time, one could still "halt a horse at the pass entrance," and although the fish had already reached the treetops, the water level was not yet too high. It can also be seen that the road was still passable, allowing one to halt a horse and call for a ferry. Now, I can sail a boat to the pass. The highway is submerged in water, several zhang below the surface. I just met a group of engineers from the Ministry of Transportation who were sent to repair the national highway from Liuan to Zhoujiakou. They were forced to wait on this isolated island with nothing to do. It is said that the road has been preliminarily surveyed and requires 800,000 cubic meters of earth and the construction of fifty-six bridges. A section chief named Sun was robbed by armed men, allegedly posing as soldiers, on the way to Fuyang.

Tang Dynasty poet Song Zhiwen's poem "First Night at the Huai Estuary" states: "At night, the Chu songs evoke unbearable homesickness, especially at the time of year when the trees are shedding leaves in the Huainan region." He was also in this place, but he was homesick, which is irrelevant to us. However, Huangfu Ran's poem states: "...How can the evening mists and frosts be described? West of Shouyang, the water is endless!" He was merely using literary exaggeration, but now it has truly become a prophecy. It is not just west of Shouyang; now, Shou County relies on a circle of city walls to enclose a circle of dry land. The people of Shou County are reliving old historical lessons. Alas!

Reliving Old Historical Lessons, The People's Fate Is Shared with Fish and Shrimp

Zhengyangguan belongs to Shou County. Its local history is originally a record intertwined with floods and warfare.

"In the Yichou year of Yongle (1405), the Huai River flooded, and the Fei River silted up, turning into a lake, causing damage to the northwest city walls year after year, being repaired and destroyed without a single peaceful year. In the summer of the Ding Si year of Zhengtong (1437), continuous rain fell for more than three weeks, causing the Huai and Fei Rivers to connect. The narrow mouth of the Xiakou Pass could not handle the rushing flow, so the four gates were closed, and earth and wood were transported to prevent the flood. Only three feet of the battlements remained above water, causing panic and fear among the old and young. Commander Liu Hou urgently dispatched transport ships and seized merchant vessels to first transport the elderly and weak to the Huai mountains, and then moved the young and strong to the high ground on the southeast city walls, allowing the people to rest. Then, on the first day of June, a strong northwest wind blew, and huge waves crashed against the city walls, causing 798 zhang to collapse, with over 6,650 chi of embankments. Towers, turrets, wood, and stone were all swept away in an instant." (Record of the Reconstruction of City Turrets in Shouzhou Wei by Luo Zhi of the Ming Dynasty)

"In the mid-Jiading period (1522-1566), the Yellow River changed course, and torrential floods flowed from the Xu and Pei regions into the Huai and Fei Rivers, passing through Hao and Si to reach the sea. It first flowed against the Hao River, passing the core of the Huachen Lake, where silt accumulated in nine out of ten places. During the peak summer months, torrential rains occurred repeatedly. The Ying, Liu, Ru, and Ying Rivers, along with the raging waves, flowed down again. The mouth of the Xiakou Pass was blocked, causing the floodwaters to stagnate and spread, covering mountains and hiding trees, boundless at a glance. The water pressed against the city, leaving only a few feet of space, and the wind blew and shook the waves. The people drove their lives and industries, sharing their fate with the fish and shrimp." (Record of Soil Reinforcement of the Earth City by Xie Zhongzeng of the Ming Dynasty)

"In the Bing Yin year of Jiading (1566), a great flood breached the city, and countless residents were buried in the bellies of fish." (Record of the Reconstruction of Shouzhou City by Xie Kaichong of the Qing Dynasty)

"In the sixth year of Shunzhi (1649), continuous rain caused a great flood to surround the city, reaching within a foot of the battlements. More than a thousand zhang of the city wall collapsed." "In the fifth year of Tongzhi (1866), the great flood reached within a foot of the battlements." (Shouzhou Gazetteer)

This year is once again reliving the old lesson: "Within a foot of the battlements." The 20th year of the Republic (1931) has already been experienced once. Generally, the Huai River floods are not caused by the Huai River itself rising suddenly, but by the Yellow River diverting its course. However, tracing back to the root cause, it is still the Yellow River.

Sun Jiading of the Qing Dynasty wrote: "During the Daoguang years (1821-1850), the Yellow River breached its banks repeatedly, flowing into the Huai River through two waterways, carrying silt and sand. The Huai River suffered as a result. Therefore, the lower reaches of Shou, such as Huaiyuan, Linhuai, Wuhe, and Xuyi counties, all of which the Huai River passes through, were silted up and lost their commanding position, unable to flow smoothly, and the flooding of Shou became even more severe."

Asking the elders and verifying with history, the residents have been paying taxes to build the city and repair the dikes for thousands of years, with hardly a peaceful year. They have consumed a large amount of materials and labor, and it cannot be said that they have not exhausted their wisdom. However, the Yellow and Huai Rivers are a major problem that cannot be slightly reversed by the residents of one place. The flood of the 20th year of the Republic (1931) was due to the rise of the Huai River, while this year it is the Yellow River diverting its course, also carrying silt and sand. The Huai River bed will be further silted up, and if the water rises again in the future, the disaster will undoubtedly become more serious. But today, stopping the boat at the Zhengyangguan Pass, looking north at the vast river, the water and sky boundless, only increases the emotion of sorrow!

The Liang Dynasty Fought Over Weirs, The Jin Dynasty Saw Grass and Trees as Soldiers

Since the Jin, Song, Qi, and Northern Wei dynasties, the divisions and changes of power all regarded Taizhou as an important town. Song Zhenxi Mountain said: "The key to the east of the Huai lies in the Qinghe Estuary, and the key to the west of the Huai lies in the Wo and Ying Estuary." The Ying Estuary is Zhengyangguan. In ancient times, there was no Longhai Railway, no cars. Troops could rely on land marches, and the water transport depended on the three estuaries, so the military situation entirely depended on the gains and losses of the Huai River. The Wei and Jin dynasties used troops to compete with Jiangdong for hegemony, first occupying Shouchun to control the Fei Estuary and protect Zhengyang. In times of division, the north and south of the Huai River were often cleared for hundreds of miles, and Zhengyang was the hub for naval forces, occupied as a key location. In the third year of YanChang (514 AD), the Liang built a floating mountain, and the water invaded, harming the Huai and Si Rivers. Cui Liang attacked the Liang army at Xiashi (Fei Estuary). In the second month of the fourth year, Xiao Shi greatly defeated the Liang army in the Huai River region. In the ninth month, the Huai weir burst, and more than 100,000 people of the Liang Dynasty were all swept into the sea. A war was launched for the sake of a dam. Fighting for water is the most obvious example. At that time, this place belonged to Liang Yuzhou. Liu Laozhi broke its general Liang Cheng and beheaded him. Liu Yuanfu defeated Fu Jian with 8,000 soldiers. In the Battle of Feishui, every grass and tree looked like a soldier. It was a famous battle in history. Later, Liu Yuan garrisoned Xuzhou, managing the Central Plains, following the trend of the eastward flow, and annexing the area east of the Yangtze River. As for the late Ming Dynasty, there were roaming bandits coming from the west, occupying Zhengyangguan as their stronghold. It cannot be said that they were ignorant of the advantages of the terrain. They then attacked Taizhou. Fang Zhenru led the army and the people to defend it, but it did not fall after half a month. The roaming bandits then fled east to Dingyuan and eventually collapsed from hunger. During the Shizong Dynasty, Zhao Kuangyin led his troops to attack Shouzhou for three years without success. Liu Renzhan of the Southern Tang Dynasty defended it with strong walls, relying on the water to hold firm, and fought against the Zhou army at Zhengyang, defeating the Zhou army. The Zhou army then trained a naval force to capture it, occupying Di, He, Guang, and Shu up to Yangzhou, and cutting off its grain and supplies. However, Shouzhou did not fall, and the other states could not be secured. During the Xiande years, Shouzhou was captured, and the wind shook the Huai and Si Rivers. Jin Wuzhu crossed the Huai River to occupy Zhengyang and Shouchun, and the Yangtze River was empty, causing shock throughout the country. Yue Fei led his troops east, and the Huai generals were fearful. Only Han Shizhong defeated the Jin army at Shouzhou and Zhengyang. Wuzhu then took the Ying Estuary, leading his troops north. The Yangtze River was slightly relieved, and the Song Dynasty was able to reorganize its military preparations. The importance of the Ying Estuary is evident from this.

Chairman Chiang Supervised the Battle in the Northern Expedition, Enemy寇 Crossed the Pass Three Times

During the Northern Expedition, Chairman Chiang supervised the battle at Zhengyangguan, and the army marched out of the Huai River region to meet the Longhai Railway in order to capture Xuzhou. In the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), there was a street named "Zhongzheng" in Zhengyangguan. During the great flood of the 20th year (1931), the water level in Zhengyangguan was several feet higher than this year, and this street was particularly high, making it the only place not flooded.

After the Anti-Japanese War, in April of the 27th year (1938), the enemy occupied Bengbu and in May lost Xuzhou. The enemy then regrouped from Xuzhou and Jining and went back to Kaifeng, and then attacked Kaifeng with the enemy crossing the Yellow River from the south. Kaifeng fell on June 5th. The enemy in the Anhui region had already knocked on Zhengyangguan, posing a threat to take Pinghan along the Huai River. The Yellow River dikes broke, causing flooding in the Central Plains, thwarting the enemy's entire plan to take Wuhan along the Pinghan Line that year. The enemy occupied Zhengyangguan for only three days before withdrawing, returning to capture Shou County. This flood indeed delayed the enemy's offensive for three months. In September, the enemy used motorboats to travel up the Huai River from the west, passing Zhengyangguan and reaching Huangchuan. After landing, they captured Weishan and entered Xinyang, and then attacked south along the Pinghan Road. The land route also took Zhengyangguan, transporting supplies to capture Gushi, Shangcheng, and Macheng, and then jointly attacked Hankou. The enemy transported grain and ammunition, implementing a major encirclement of Wuhan, passing directly through Zhengyangguan. The entire army fled west, without occupying every stronghold they passed through. "Bandits" then took the opportunity to extort money from the residents, threatening to shoot in the town, in the assumption that the enemy forces might land, Zhengyangguan would be slaughtered. After suffering extortion, the residents had to find boats to send them away. Looking back on the past, the residents were all frightened and had headaches. In the 33rd year (1944), the Central Plains battle began. This was a battle that resulted in a great loss of face. The enemy troops once again passed through Zhengyangguan, and infantry and cavalry went up the Ying River, capturing Yingshang. Originally, they planned to enter the Yellow River area from the south with a long diversion, but were met with a head-on attack from our elite troops. It can be said that it was the first time they had suffered a serious foreign attack when passing through the Huai River. They then retreated, abandoning corpses, and returned to Shou County and Xinbu. The originally stationed army that had suddenly disappeared re-entered Zhengyangguan and built large-scale fortifications. The officers who built these fortifications even erected stone tablets, recording their achievements, saying that they had driven away the enemy with these fortifications. The people said: "He has turned the days upside down."

Digging into the Zhengyang Legends, Writing History Will Be a Sensation

The enemy cavalry roamed around, but Zhengyangguan was unharmed because Zhengyangguan had become a smuggling hole. The companies and firms of those big shots numbered in the dozens, and the population had jumped from 30,000 to 100,000. The mechanical factory of the original No. 9 Vocational Middle School had become a warehouse for the Anhui Provincial Enterprise Company. Although the Japanese didn't arrive, Koreans came here to do business openly and brazenly. Mohekou, across the river from Zhengyangguan, was another gateway and another group. There were many disputes between the two sides, but some Shanghai businessmen came out and said a word, and the deal was settled, which was relatively eased. When they brought up the past, they still remembered it vividly, such as how they did business with arms, as if this was inseparable from the past glory, and it was much more interesting than talking about today's flood. The so-called commodity exchange, using tung oil to exchange lipstick and beer, and those companies even included the transport of their families. To put it nicely, the work of these companies and firms had never been inspected. The most that could be said was that they did not publish battle reports and achievements, unlike military affairs with obvious gains and losses, so they made a mess of it all. However, the people of Zhengyangguan were very clear. They had seen enough with their own eyes. With a state of emergency declared, goods entered and left like a tide under unified inspection. The commodity tax bureau of today is like a lifetime ago, inevitably full of vicissitudes, but with or without taxes, there must always be the strength of guns, and then there can be an "economic war," otherwise the war will not be fought and will be completely defeated. The people said they all got rich—they won.

Zhengyangguan is a gateway, while Jieshou is a transfer station. Above the Ying River, it was prosperous all the way. After the victory, the prosperity of Mohekou and other places disappeared rapidly. Zhengyangguan returned from 100,000 people to 30,000, as if it was a dream. It is still strange that in the 33rd year (1944), as the situation in the Central Plains tightened, those warehouses and shops had to affix the Japanese military's symbols taken from Shou County to protect themselves. Is this the economic warfare characteristic of Zhengyangguan? This is a place where legends were born, and although other legends are being created elsewhere, the glory of Zhengyangguan is indelible. Since the Anti-Japanese War, no reporter from the rear has come here to observe. After the Anti-Japanese War, I am still the first, but I regret that I have come too late, and many legends have lost their freshness. If someone wrote an objective history of Zhengyangguan in the last eight years, exposing many faces, it would definitely be a sensation.

The Longhai Railway's Fourth Line Is Interrupted, Resuming the Smuggling Route

After the victory, the speed at which the 70,000 people were demobilized was quite admirable, and they left completely within a few months. The remaining local people are now dazed in the encirclement of water. Those small merchants have indeed gained some benefits. In recent months, they have been too lazy to set sail. They have to collect enough fares, load enough goods, and make enough money before they make a trip up or down. It is not uncommon to buy a ticket and wait four or five days. Everything is in their hands, and the country bumpkins have no choice but to tremble under their power. Because of overloading, it also happened that people and goods sank in the turbid flow. There is no greater monopoly of transportation than this. The Anhui Provincial Highway Bureau has no way to do things, and it also does transportation, which is no different from doing business. The Zheng-Beng Joint Transport on the Huainan Line always sails every day, regardless of whether there are passengers or not, which is quite convenient for merchants, but it is attacked for the "monopoly" crime, because merchants have a choice of objects.

With the Longhai Road cut off, the first and second batches of guests from the Central Plains to Jiangsu and Anhui have taken the route from Luohe Jieshou to reach here. You can take a car between Luohe and Jieshou and arrive in one day. The waterway between Jieshou and Zheng requires V time to reach the Pinghan Road. This route was originally a smuggling route in the past. Unexpectedly, it is still useful one year after the victory, but it is still a dangerous route. If the Longhai continues to be inaccessible, this transportation line can still slightly revive the face of prosperity, but it is not a stop, but a passage.

The Grieving Son Suckles on His Wet Nurse's Corpse, The Plague God Wears Fur Coats Backwards

Walking on the streets of Zhengyangguan, this isolated island is not all dry land. There are puddles of accumulated water everywhere. You have to have some skill to walk on a wooden plank. I saw a group of people wearing filial piety clothes walking on the road. A person in front of them was sending thank-you notes to the households, and then a person wearing filial piety clothes would kneel and kowtow at the door. This family had just finished a funeral and was now going door-to-door to thank those who came to offer condolences. Even in the shacks where the disaster victims live, people wearing filial piety clothes can be seen everywhere, white from head to toe. The flood brought not only water but also plagues. According to the statistics of a private hospital, more than 500 people have died in the past 20 days, all from cholera. An average of 20 people die every day, with a record high of more than 60 people dying every day! More than 1,000 people have been cured of the disease. In short, these are terrible numbers. Only coffin shops have good business. Residents do not believe in getting vaccinated, and there was a shortage of vaccines at the time. Does the administrative agency care? It doesn't care. It only handles official documents. A few bottles of vaccines were sent from Shou County just two days ago. (Also, the Relief Administration had 3,000 bags of flour to distribute to Shou County. The people of Zhengyangguan said: We didn't see a single grain.)

The vaccines have arrived, and enough people have already died. In fact, vaccines alone cannot save the people. It also requires publicity and persuasion, with organization, so-called administration, but none of this is talked about. Dr. Xu Zhishen told me that he spoke until his tongue was dry, telling residents the importance of getting vaccinated. If he charged a fee, he would be suspected of seeking business for himself. He is not a doctor, but he is a trusted doctor in the region. The Shoumin Hospital he established has become a plague hospital. If valued at market prices, injecting 3,000 cc of salt water would cost 100,000 yuan, which is definitely not affordable for the poor (a coffin is only 40,000 to 50,000 yuan). His self-made salt water has saved many people here and is praised by the townspeople.

Residents who contract diseases naturally do not all go to the hospital. They also have their own treatment methods. In the evening, you can hear the sound of firecrackers being set off loudly. A person comes out of a household, wearing a fur coat backwards, with his face painted like a clown. Firecrackers are set off behind him, and the place where this gentleman walks is swept with a broom. This gentleman is a "Plague God." After this procedure, it is considered that the Plague God has been sent away. This is one of the standard treatments.

One family didn't open the door all day. There were originally a mother and son living inside. The neighbors broke down the door and found that the woman had died of infection, and her son was still sucking on her breast. It is truly a terrifying place!

Northern Anhui Is Facing Famine, Warfare Cannot Be Seen Again

Although Zhengyangguan is harmed by water, it also relies on water for its position. The disaster situation in the entire Northern Anhui region is extremely serious. The reporter has been living on Zhengyangguan Island for several days and has repeatedly heard of bandits robbing nearby flooded villages. After the Yellow River receded, the flooded areas were covered with silt several feet thick. This road is obstructed, and pedestrians are unable to walk. It is like the first thawing of the icy river in northern Sai, and even if you step on it, you are in danger of being submerged. Residents use long wooden planks as levers, stepping on the mud. This is a feature of the Yellow River silt. Therefore, if there is a war, this area is not suitable for speeding. At present, the Pi River can still be used to transport the abundant grains of Liuan. The price of rice is 50,000 yuan per 250 catties, which is relatively low. But compared to the income of the general public, it is no lower than Beijing and Shanghai. It is hard to believe that famine can be avoided.

The most serious problem is the appearance of bandits. It is said that Zhao Guan 余, Zhao Chou, and his armed forces of about 700 or 800 people are east of Tai County. They claim to be the Communist Army. If the famine victims attach to them, and the Communist Army uses them, then it will become a force that confronts the government head-on. Armed forces scattered elsewhere are indistinguishable by name, and people traveling in northern Anhui are suffering greatly, and there are also "impostor" troops.

After the border conflict between Henan and Hubei broke out, the Communist Army of Li Xiannian entered northern Anhui and eastern Anhui. One route went along the irrigation river in southern Henan, passed through Sanhejian to cross the Ying River, and went to the outer edge of Xuzhou through Wo and Meng; another route went along the eastern foothills of Mount Huoshan, through Maotanchang and Guanting west of Hefei, and then crossed the Huainan Road to the vicinity of Mingguang to northern Jiangsu. The purpose was to gather the main force, avoid being scattered, and military transfers were very busy, with many stragglers. According to people from Sanhejian, they passed through at the beginning of this month, demanding grain and vegetables from the local area. Without stopping, they went north.

The Nationalist Army guards key points, if they are trapped by grain. The important town of Zhengyang, which has always been important for warfare, is an area for military affairs, not a place for military preparations. After the Northern Expedition, there were ten years of war. In the spring of the 20th year (1931), Peng Dehuai's and Xu Xiangqian's troops once occupied Zhengyangguan from the border between Henan, Hubei, and Anhui for only three days. Xu Tingyao's troops attacked it from Bengbu along the Huai River. The Communist Army attacked and captured Jinjiazai. The Communist Army then withdrew completely from Anhui Province.

Today, the disaster victims in Northern Anhui are everywhere. The disasters of floods are enough. It is impossible to sweep away the areas harassed by the knife troops!

### 10,000 Tons of Vietnamese Rice Arrive in Shanghai

The Procurement Department of the Central Trust Bureau recently ordered over 10,000 tons of rice from Vietnam. The first batch is already en route and will arrive in Shanghai shortly. It is reported that the main purpose of this batch of rice is to supply the people's food needs, so it will be entrusted to the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation for sale.

### Fengshan Coal Mine: Shanghai Merchants Organize Company; Mining Can Commence Shortly

Following the news of the discovery of a coal mine in Fengshan, Yuyao, last month, Mr. Lu Shenkang, the manager of the Public Coal Company in this city, went to hire workers to conduct trial excavations, which have been successful. According to the estimation of the mining engineer accompanying Mr. Lu, the reserves are at least 300,000 tons. Mr. Lu has now returned to Shanghai to start raising capital and organizing a company, with Wang Xiaolai serving as chairman. Mining can commence shortly. It is rumored that a light railway will be laid from the iron ore area to Andong, directly reaching the Qiantang River, to facilitate large-scale transportation directly to Shanghai.

### Hong Kong Bans Export of Piece Goods, Except Those Unrelated to China

[United Press, Hong Kong, 14th] At the request of the Chinese government, the Hong Kong government has officially banned the export of all piece goods starting today. A Hong Kong government spokesperson stated that it was recently discovered that cotton yarn originally intended for relief purposes in China was smuggled from China to Shanghai, made into piece goods, and then transported to other places. The spokesperson added that the Chinese government requested Hong Kong to take measures to prevent this. The spokesperson pointed out that this ban will affect two types of piece goods: those made in China and those made from cotton yarn imported from China. Piece goods destined for Shanghai and unrelated to China are not subject to this ban.

### An Ji Securities Firm Officially Opens Today

An Ji Securities Firm, Broker No. 224 of the Shanghai Securities Exchange, managed by Nie Linxiang and Lu Yousheng, specializing in securities trading, will officially open today. Messrs. Nie and Lu, in their securities business, have always been known for their stability and agility, and their keen observation of market trends and in-depth analysis have been particularly appreciated by clients.

### Measures for Managing Export of Yarn and Cloth Under Consideration; Smuggling Routes to Southern China Exist by Land and Water

[Report from this Newspaper] This reporter recently met with Mr. Liu Wenteng of the Textile Industry Management Committee to inquire about the progress of drafting measures for managing the export of yarn and cloth. According to him, the measures are currently being carefully reviewed. They are actively soliciting opinions from all parties to gather broad perspectives so that the management measures, once drafted, can be applicable in all aspects. He stated that before the domestic supply of yarn and cloth returns to normal, it is necessary to temporarily adopt management measures for export to maintain the principle of stable domestic prices for yarn and cloth. Once production increases and supply exceeds demand, not only will management not be imposed, but exports will be encouraged. As for the rumors of smuggling yarn and cloth to Southern China, the inside situation is quite complex. It is heard that some of the yarn and cloth exports from this city pass through customs, but some go through Hankou, reaching Guangzhou via the Yuehan Railway. Another part goes through the land route of Jinhua, transshipped to Guangxi. Neither of these routes passes through customs. The Committee is currently closely monitoring the situation. If necessary, personnel will be sent to the Guangzhou area to investigate the actual sales of yarn and cloth to clarify the situation.

### Shipping Industry Raises Prices; Maritime Administration Bureau to Intervene; Price Increase Must Be Submitted to the Ministry for Approval

The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association has resolved to increase prices by 450% based on the original prices, effective from the 21st of this month. After this news spread, all parties expressed deep concern. According to a responsible person from the Maritime Administration Bureau, the industry has not yet submitted the price increase to the Bureau. Before approval is granted by the Ministry, it is not allowed to implement the increase without authorization according to regulations. The Bureau, with its related responsibilities, has decided to prohibit the increase unless an approved price increase order from the Ministry arrives, at which point implementation will be permitted.

### Draft Standardization Law

[Report from this Newspaper] In order to promote the standardization of various goods, measurements, symbols, names, etc., the Ministry of Economic Affairs has drafted a Standardization Law and submitted it to the court. The draft has been jointly reviewed and passed by the Legal and Economic Affairs divisions. The draft is recorded as follows:

Article 1: The term "standard" in this law refers to a national standard formulated in accordance with the standard formulation procedures and universally observed throughout the country.

The aforementioned standard formulation procedures shall be determined by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

(1) Names, definitions, symbols, and constants of various units

(2) Standards for various qualities and dimensions

(3) Standards for various test methods

(4) Standards for various interchangeability performances

(5) Various safety standards

(6) Other standards to be observed

Article 3: The Ministry of Economic Affairs shall establish a Central Standards Bureau to handle various standardization matters.

Article 4: Standards universally observed throughout the country shall be formulated by the Central Standards Bureau in accordance with the standard formulation procedures and submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval and promulgation.

Article 5: Products and methods that meet the standards shall be marked with a "(Standard)" symbol after being reviewed and approved by the Central Standards Bureau for identification.

Article 6: Goods manufactured, imported, or exported, and the test methods used, shall comply with the prescribed standards. The implementation measures shall be determined by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

Article 7: The Central Standards Bureau may submit various draft regulations to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval to promote the metric system standard.

Article 8: Anyone who uses fraudulent methods to request review or abuses the "(Standard)" symbol shall be prosecuted for fraud.

Article 9: This law shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

### Only Collect Inferior Banknotes; Issue Exquisite Banknotes in Exchange

The Central Bank, due to the shortage of materials during the War of Resistance, had to adopt a single-paper-single-version method for the banknotes issued to meet the needs, resulting in a variety of styles circulating in the market. To simplify matters, it has decided to implement a system of only collecting and not issuing banknotes that are poorly printed or of inferior paper quality, gradually reducing the amount in circulation. It will select 1,000-yuan banknotes from inventory for replacement issuance to prevent counterfeiting and paper damage. As for the original set of 100-yuan, 200-yuan, 400-yuan, 500-yuan, 1,000-yuan, and 2,000-yuan banknotes, improvements are still difficult to achieve temporarily due to material limitations.

### Textile Control Committee to Re-inspect Private Factories Immediately

After the expansion of the organization of the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, plans have also been drafted. The investigation of private textile factories previously conducted by the Ministry will be re-inspected. If any fictitious or improper circumstances are found, a report will be submitted to the Ministry for handling in accordance with the law.

### Valuation Keeps Rising; Factories Difficult to Take Over

Regarding the government's preferential allocation of 22 factories to industrialists in the rear, due to inconsistencies among the three responsible parties—the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region, the Bureau for Handling Enemy and Puppet Property, and the Central Trust Bureau—the valuation of the factory bases has been changed three times, and the price has been increasing. The Sichuan-Guizhou Factory Association has specifically suggested convening a joint meeting to deliberate on the valuation and takeover procedures to reduce the difficulties in taking over the factories. Active consultations are currently underway with the relevant responsible authorities.

### Authorities to Uniformly Manage Money Exchange Businesses

The money exchange business in this city has a long history, but its governing authority has not yet been approved. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to this and is preparing to uniformly manage it. At the same time, it is also planning to strictly regulate the business operations of the industry to avoid affecting financial security. Furthermore, as the money exchange business is not a formal money shop, any mixing of money shop licenses will be prohibited.

### Ex-dividend and Ex-rights: Minor Difficulties in Settlement

— Qin

In a rush, I roughly flipped through the Operating Rules promulgated by the Stock Exchange. Article 57 states that "The trading of stocks on the day before the suspension of registration is ex-dividend trading. The ex-dividend or ex-rights shall be announced by the Exchange." As for bonds, simply cutting off the coupon is sufficient. However, for stocks, there are actually some complications. Past experience tells us that companies and manufacturers must first publish a notice before holding a shareholders' meeting to suspend transfer of ownership. The procedures for ex-dividend or ex-rights cannot be completed in just one day after the transaction. Some companies and manufacturers often deliberately want to boost the value of their stocks, locking up shareholders' shares for a longer period during the dividend or rights issuance period. If this article is followed, the seller on the day before will not actually be able to obtain the dividends or rights they are entitled to before settlement the next day. Regarding this technical issue, I wonder if the Exchange has made preparations to collect dividends or rights on behalf of the seller. Otherwise, difficulties will inevitably arise in settlement. I hope the Exchange will make a regulation soon.

### Answering Readers: Legal Questions

(1) Unmarried Cohabitation

Wan Yuan asks: Miss Jia is 20 years old and was engaged to Mr. Yi last fall. However, Mr. Yi does not engage in honest work. Since the engagement, Miss Jia has been seduced and fallen, and is now pregnant. Mr. Yi's parents secretly instigate, thinking they have succeeded. (1) Can Mr. Yi be arrested and prosecuted for luring away or seducing if Miss Jia's parents report to the police? (2) Can Mr. Yi's parents be charged for secretly instigating and using drugs? (3) If Mr. Yi intends to take Miss Jia to a distant place to get married, and Miss Jia's parents and the matchmaker do not attend, is this kind of marriage legal? (4) If Miss Jia has regretted and wants to return to her mother's home, but her parents believe she voluntarily left and refuse to let her return, is this legal?

[Answer from Lawyer Zhu Ya Kui] (1) Luring away or seduction with the intention of adultery, according to Articles 242 and 241 of the Criminal Law, is limited to those who are under 20 years old. (2) According to Article 29, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, an instigator shall be punished according to the crime they instigated (but there must be definite evidence of instigation). Drug use is another issue. (3) According to Article 981 of the Civil Code, the marriage of a minor should obtain the consent of a legal representative, while adults are free. (4) Natural blood relations cannot be severed by artificial means.

(2) Applying for a Name Change

Zhu Xin Huan asks: (1) My friend graduated from a certain university in 1934. Now, because a relative has the same name and lives on the same street, there are many inconveniences. May I ask (1) whether an application can be made to the government to change the name based on the above circumstances? (2) To which government agency should the application be made, and what are the procedures? (3) I heard that the government before the war formulated special laws regulating the name change method, is this true? What is the name? In what legal publication is it contained?

[Answer from Lawyer Zhu Ya Kui] Changing one's name is not a legal issue, it is an administrative procedure. You can check the administrative regulations of the National Government.

(3) Lineage Inheritance

Fan Jin Dao asks: I have three questions about lineage inheritance, please provide answers: (1) Besides an only heir to the lineage, there is still a thread of uncertainty, and there is no Zhaomu (equivalent generation) available to take over. Can the inheritance be confiscated and made public? (2) Originally, the Jia branch inherited the Yi branch. Now, because the Yi branch is thriving, but the Jia branch has died out, and the descendants of the Yi branch are closer in bloodline, can they inherit again? If a distant relative outside the fifth degree of mourning from the Jia branch interferes, is there any legal restraint? (3) How should one deal with someone who uses the name of inheritance but does not establish a separate household?

[Answer from Lawyer Zhu Ya Kui] Lineage inheritance has been abolished since the implementation of the Inheritance Compilation of the Civil Code on May 5, 1931. However, it can still be applied if the inheritance began before that date. (1) If there is a daughter, she should inherit; otherwise, it should go to the national treasury. (2) If the deceased or the woman observing chastity is choosing a successor, they only need to be of the equivalent generation. If the relative meeting is choosing a successor, the acceptance is limited by the closeness and remoteness of relatives. (3) There is no connection whatsoever.

A Surviving Human Bomb

First, let me introduce myself. I am from Changlai Town, at the junction of Tonghai in Northern Jiangsu. Last month, in the "Liberated Area," I was ordered to charge the Three Factory. Two or three hundred vanguards, holding bamboo poles, tied with straw, raised fire and shouted to kill. They were followed by more than a hundred armed guards. It was quite impressive, with shouts of killing reaching the sky, fulfilling the greatest responsibility of democracy. Fortunately, the National Army inside the factory did not pay attention, so all the human bombs escaped early. Offering wives and sisters was also out of the question. Now, everywhere is blocked, and there is no way to escape! The purpose of the blockade is nothing more than to have us continue to perform the spirit of democracy. May I ask Mr. Communist Party, is it permissible for me to escape this time? Can I or can't I?

I have been a human bomb, fortunately not detonated. The number of human bombs that cannot escape will be countless. This kind of democracy is really a bit scary! (Shi Tingrong)

Traitors Who Kill Without Bloodshed

Editor: I am a small employee in a copper and tin store. During the enemy puppet era, there were many treacherous merchants in our industry and in hardware stores who colluded with the enemy's military department and Yangxing such as Mitsui and Mitsubishi, using mercury, copper, tin, hardware, etc. and melting down copper coins in large quantities to provide resources to the enemy, doing things that harmed the country and killed people without bloodshed, earning a lot of sinful money.

After the victory, many political traitors were imprisoned or tried to prove the law with their own bodies, but these economic traitors who supplied military goods to the enemy (complete traitors) were still free, some living as secluded in the seas, hoarding goods for speculation, and smuggling foreign goods without paying taxes. Their past crimes are even worse than political traitors. So, I hope the authorities will investigate the account books of all copper and tin stores in the past (please note that they have false account books) or check the import and export books of the enemy Yangxing and the Zhengjin Bank. I think it will be possible to find out the truth.

The copper and tin industry is roughly divided into two gangs: the Nanjing gang and the Shaoxing gang. Some have fled to escape punishment, but are still living as secluded in the seas, and recently, there are still some who are doing speculative businesses on a large scale. We hope that the authorities will immediately send personnel to secretly investigate to clarify the truth and alert traitors. (Ye Liqing)

Punishing Traitors Is Transformed Into a Corrupt Policy

Editor: It is welcomed by merchants and civilians that the government formally punishes real traitors. Now in recovered areas, whether cities or towns, reporting traitors is an opportunity to profit and seek revenge! Although national law is impartial, a lawsuit against a suspected traitor will lead to family ruin and death even if he is declared innocent! The civilians who cannot afford to flee from the occupied areas are all at risk of being reported. The people are confused. Does the government care about innocent civilians in the occupied areas (except for Communists) and have a compassionate solution? (Reader Xiang Baiyun)

### On Behalf of Mailing

Reply to Mr. Wang Tairan: Recently, we received a letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Government stating: "Your institution's letter of August 23, forwarding reader Wang's letter, on the matter of not releasing relief materials, has been copied and sent to the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference for verification." This is a reply.

Li Zheng: Please inform us of the name of the school you were admitted to.

Reply to a certain gentleman on Penglai Road: The Shanghai Municipal Government replied regarding the matter of the Yinhang Airport land being occupied: "The land in this case is currently undergoing requisition procedures. The letter in advance has been approved, and a corresponding reply is hereby made. Please check and inform."

Reply to a certain gentleman: Regarding the matter of the house being forcibly occupied, the First Pacification District Headquarters replied: "The matter has been telegraphed to the 17th Army Commander for investigation." Special reply.

Reply to Mr. Hua: Magistrate Li of Jinshan County wrote: "During the period when this county was occupied, the enemy built a monument to the Tamabe Unit's loyal souls in the public stadium. After the victory, it should have been demolished early to clear the shame. The reason for the delay is that the war-resistant soldiers and civilians in the local area suffered extremely heavy sacrifices at the beginning of the occupation. It is planned to be converted into a monument to the martyrs who died in the war of resistance for a long time. The approval was given in the previous letter, except that the police were ordered to immediately demolish the monument. A corresponding reply is hereby made, and please convey it."

Reply to Ling Qun: China Middle School wrote: (Excerpt) Our school was once used as a refugee shelter and occupied by retreating troops from the South City during the War of Resistance, causing significant losses. After the victory, there must be a considerable recovery, so a small enrollment fee is collected from new students for equipment. If our school is indeed using this mentality to generate revenue, why not collect from all 700 students instead of just charging this small amount of 5,000 yuan from over one hundred new students? (Excerpt)

Reply to Mr. Zhong Jianzhi: Rongchang Wool Company replied to our letter: We received your letter. The manuscript of Zhong Jianzhi from Shaolou Town differs greatly from the facts. When Mr. Jin came to our store to purchase goods, the staff in charge explained that the Empress and Double Cat were the same quality and the price was the same. If he thought it was not suitable, he could exchange it. Later, Mr. Jin sent a letter expressing dissatisfaction. Our company immediately sent a letter of explanation and apologized to him. It is a pity that Mr. Zhong did not come to negotiate again. Our company is still waiting for Mr. Zhong to come and exchange for goods of the same price, which can be resolved satisfactorily.

### How to Deal with Supervisors

— Fei Wen

If we want to contact supervisors - the principals of an industrial or commercial enterprise - regarding business, we must possess the following conditions:

(1) We must consult with them on decided matters, not ask them to decide matters.

(2) We must discuss principles with them, not present those trivial details.

(3) Speak simply, directly, clearly, and completely.

(4) Be well prepared.

(5) Be concise, not long-winded.

At the same time, a supervisor often has the following characteristics. Conversely, if you want to become a supervisor, you must possess the following characteristics:

(1) Supervisors plan everything in advance, rather than digging a well when they are thirsty.

(2) Supervisors base their decisions on facts and figures.

(3) Supervisors like methods that can improve work efficiency and plans that can increase sales.

(4) Supervisors also like to research ways to promote labor-management cooperation.

(5) When considering things, supervisors think of the whole picture rather than piecemeal.

(6) A supervisor's thoughts are concentrated on the following departments:

A. Production, B. Sales, C. Economic dispatching, D. Management

### The Revival of the British Textile Industry

— Original by Wilter Hill, Abridged and Translated by Deng Shaoqiu

Cotton is indeed the most important textile raw material in the world according to quantitative standards, because cotton fabrics are used widely and frequently. If judged by other standards, cotton should still take precedence, and no other natural or man-made fiber can match it. Therefore, Britain and its colonies are the countries that produce the most cotton and cotton fabrics in the world, and the prosperity of the textile industry has a close relationship with the entire future of Britain.

Before the Second World War, the textile industry naturally occupied the most important position in British export trade. In 1936, the total value of British textile exports was as high as five million pounds, and in 1937 it increased further to sixty-eight million five hundred thousand pounds. From this, it can be seen that the British government and public attach great importance to the revival of the textile industry.

Labor and Technology

However, the most serious problem for the British textile industry after the war is the current or short-term difficulty: the shortage of production. Most of the workers were conscripted into the war or transferred to the military industry. Before the war, there were as many as 500,000 workers, but now it has shrunk to less than half. As a result, not only is it impossible to increase the export volume of textiles, but also it is not enough to supply the clothing needs of the British people. In other words, the first step for Britain to revive its textile industry after the war is how to increase the number of textile workers. However, there are two difficulties: (A) The wages in the military industry are higher than those in the textile industry, so the workers who were transferred to the military industry before are unwilling to return to the textile industry. (B) After serving in the military industry, textile workers are accustomed to the comfortable environment and generous treatment of aircraft and other modern industries, and they may not be willing to return to their old jobs.

However, this difficulty is easy to solve. The most difficult problem for the British textile industry today is the technical problem. After the war, in October last year and April and May this year, the British textile industry labor and management delegations visited the United States three times to investigate the current situation of the American textile industry, and found that the manufacturing methods and equipment of the domestic textile industry were far inferior to those of the United States. Therefore, they attach great importance to this, because during the war, the British textile industry had repeatedly suffered from dumping in the American and Chinese domestic and foreign markets, and its international trade volume had declined. If this continues, the future will be unimaginable. Therefore, the magnates of the British textile industry collectively requested government assistance to discuss how to save the bankrupt British textile industry. From January to June this year, after their efforts, the British textile industry has embarked on a prosperous path again.

Labor-Management Cooperation

The first countermeasure they agreed on was how to increase the number of textile workers. The labor and management sides of the British textile industry selected representatives to form a committee to study how to increase wages and improve environmental protection machinery to attract workers. Therefore, since February this year, the number of workers has increased to more than 400,000, and the production volume is also increasing day by day, but it is still far from the pre-war level, and it is even further away from their post-war plan to monopolize the entire world textile market.

Then they discussed the second countermeasure. The labor and management sides suggested the following points: (A) Stabilize production, (B) Work in shifts, (C) Labor-management cooperation, (D) Merge textiles, and renovate factories. The most important thing is to meet the economic principles of mass production. From the technology of textiles, we want a thorough reform, merge work steps, concentrate production capacity, and strive to meet the standards of long-term production. In addition, labor and management must cooperate closely to improve work efficiency.

In other aspects, in order to improve the quality of British textiles, it is planned to gradually adopt modern machinery and implement a day and night shift system to fully utilize new equipment. Moreover, the British textile industry jointly established a textile product research institute in April this year, hiring a number of famous textile experts from the United States and Britain, who have been constantly researching the improvement of products day and night. After more than two months of research, British textiles have now achieved the following results.

Research Work

Researchers used new tools to review the molecular arrangement of textile fibers to improve their fiber properties. At present, the British textile industry can make textiles non-shrinking, moth-proof, and waterproof, make their surface smooth like fine linen or rayon, and also make their colors pure white. Moreover, two harmonious colors can be dyed in one procedure. The above-mentioned manufacturing methods have been widely adopted by various textile factories in Britain. For example, the non-shrinking procedure has been adopted for cotton and wool knitted clothing, and it is rumored that this new invention has saved the British millions of pounds in expenses.

According to the opinions of the British textile industry spokesperson, a new textile product will appear in Britain in the future, which is neither cotton fabric, nor woollen cloth, nor silk fabric, but a textile product that is between the three. Britain has recently produced a cotton bed sheet and a woollen shirt, which are warm, comfortable, and gorgeous. At first glance, it looks like linen. And recently, since February, British textile products have had a unique brilliance, dazzling and radiant, just like silk, which is truly rare and valuable.

However, the British textile industry is still not satisfied. In recent months, representatives of the textile industry in various parts of Britain have been discussing and researching the outline of future plans. British textiles will adopt a standard mark to indicate the different sources and qualities of various textiles. In order to ensure that cotton, wool, and various textile raw materials are not in short supply, the British government has increased the tariff rate on cotton and wool produced in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa from six pence per bundle to two shillings per bundle. Therefore, in this situation, the new trends in the British textile industry will undoubtedly be of great benefit to the development of the future.

### Chinese Agricultural Production and Marketing

— Translated by Zhong Deqi

"Production" and "Distribution" are the two major problems of economics, especially important in agriculture. The author of this article, W. M. Curtiss, is a famous American agricultural economist who came to China in 1937 and taught in the Department of Agricultural Economics at Jinling University. This article emphasizes the importance of "agricultural production and marketing" in China in the future. Therefore, although it was written to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Department of Agricultural Economics at Jinling University, it can also be used as a reference for those who study Chinese agricultural economic problems. Translator's note. August 2.

The Department of Agricultural Economics at Jinling University has made significant progress in farm management, prices, and land economics in the past 25 years. I predict that in the future, it will show even greater attention to agricultural production and marketing.

In the history of agricultural education and agricultural research in the United States, it has been shown that a great deal of effort has been put into production. This is as it should be. In recent years, more attention has been focused on distribution (Translator's note: including various processes in distribution). In the United States, when consumers buy agricultural products in the market, half of the money they pay goes to the producers of the products, and half is consumed in the distribution process. The more industrialized a country becomes, the more important the distribution of edible products becomes.

In an agricultural primitive country, its fields are mostly self-sufficient type (Self Sufficient Type), and the distribution problem is less important. But if a country relies on 20% of its population to produce to supply the whole country, then the distribution problem is particularly important, and the interests of both producers and consumers are equally threatened.

As a country becomes more urbanized and industrialized, the result is that the rural population is more controlled by the distribution system. When a country's economic situation rises and falls, the extent to which farmers' income rises and falls is very large, because distribution costs are between production and consumers and are relatively fixed. Therefore, when a slump comes, the portion of money that farmers get from consumers may drop from an average of 60%, resulting in the bankruptcy of the entire farmer.

The goal of studying marketing should be to simultaneously increase the interests of producers and consumers, and this goal is not achieved by making producers take more money from consumers on production costs, but rather by improving distribution efficiency to benefit both parties. This goal should be to reduce the labor consumption and costs of production, so that distribution and consumption can both benefit more.

When China becomes more highly industrialized and agricultural production becomes a small part of the national economy, agricultural production and marketing will become even more important; therefore, the study of agricultural production and marketing must be the most important work in the work of a progressive economics department.

### Yizhi Tractor

— Translated from the New York Times Weekly

Although gasoline tractors are not the most important agricultural machinery invention, they may be the most dramatic. Due to its enormous power, it has greatly increased the efficiency of combine harvesters. During the First World War, the tractor transformed the Great Plains into an unexpected granary. The tillage time required for one acre of wheat was greatly reduced due to the use of tractors, and at the same time, the area of each field was also expanded. After the First World War, many veterans found that they were no longer needed to participate in farming, so they were forced to join the unemployment ranks in 1921.

Mechanized wheat farming continued to develop after the First World War. A total of 115,000 combines were manufactured from 1926 to 1930, while the production volume of combines in the previous five years was only 25,000. By 1938, 90% of the wheat in Kansas was harvested using combines.

In the ten years before the Second World War, the number of tractors in American rural areas almost doubled. In 1940, there were almost 1.6 million tractors in use in the United States. That was the year of the Great Depression, and buying a tractor was almost the most important move in an ordinary farmer's life. Therefore, there were indeed some forces that promoted agricultural mechanization, because if a farmer's financial ability was not enough to purchase a tractor in installments, he could mortgage his land to purchase a tractor. There are now 2 million tractors on American farmland. These tractors have a huge impact on the consolidation of land ownership, because mechanically powered equipment is suitable for use on large-scale farmland. On the one hand, mechanical equipment can do more work, and on the other hand, more investment also hopes to get greater profits. In the past, a farmer could not do much work, but now each farmer can do more than four times as much work. Many landlords own land that is scattered, and several fields may be several miles apart, but today farmers can use rubber-wheeled tractors, so the distance factor is no longer as important as it used to be.

### Introduction to Business Administration

— Xu Baiyi

Introduction to Business Administration is a series of articles, which is not easy to understand in the middle. The article was originally an introduction, followed by several principles. What is currently being discussed are various issues related to "production machinery." Each issue will start a new section in the future to facilitate readers' clipping and preservation.

D. Supervision of Work

In the process of manufacturing work, it is necessary to supervise it at any time. This supervision work can be divided into two types:

A. Supervision during work

B. Inspection during the manufacturing process of goods

The first type of work is easy to understand. For example, when we build a house, we must hire a supervisor to monitor the progress of the work. His responsibility is to prevent workers from being lazy and construction companies from cutting corners.

Regarding this aspect, there can be two methods:

The first method is to use our eyes to do the monitoring work. The foreman in the factory is the person responsible for this work. He must see whether the workers are lazy during working hours or whether they are working below standard. If he finds anything, he will immediately correct it so that it does not continue to be wrong.

The second method is to use recording methods, such as attendance. Each worker has a card. When going to work, he punches the time clock. The same is true when leaving work. Also, there are records of the work produced every day. This method can not only allow the director of a department to see the worker's performance, but also allow the company's authorities to see the factory's progress after statistical work. For example, if we run a farm with tens of thousands of cows, then each cow has a number, and there can be a statistic for how much milk is produced every day. The owner of a milk company can know everything about the cows without entering the cow farm—their production, their health, and their consumption.

The authorities of a company are not allowed to inspect everywhere all day long, so recording and statistical methods are the most able to meet their needs.

Usually, the above two types of work are carried out simultaneously.

Regarding the inspection of goods, that has a great impact on the future of the goods and must be handled seriously. I have visited the General Electric Edison Bulb Factory. Every step they make has to be inspected. Before the packaging is properly shipped out of the factory, a few are also drawn out for inspection to see if they meet the standards. For example, before drugs are shipped out of the factory, they must also undergo many inspections. Especially for the manufacture of drugs for injection, many pharmaceutical factories, in order to be cautious and clarify responsibilities, all those responsible for the inspection must sign and seal on a slip of paper attached to the medicine box.

Furthermore, in terms of editing and publishing books, proofreading is also a kind of inspection work—checking for errors. Bookstore companies like the Commercial Press and World Book Company once attached the names of the proofreaders to the copyright page for a time. This move also meant caution.

### Music and Dreams

— Sun Yu

In a book of essays, there is an article that mentions Jin music. The author said: "Music does not need to describe and carve like painting and writing, but what pictures cannot describe and what words cannot convey, music can fully express. What music gives people is the highest realm of beauty that the soul can feel, because the beauty of music is extremely abstract, and its expression can be broader and deeper, without limitations. It is a mistake to judge the appreciation of Jin music based on the associations and images it evokes." The beauty of music is extremely abstract. I think it would be more accurate to say that it is close to dreams. Music art often has a deep relationship with dreams; the famous French symphonist Berlioz (1803-1869) composed the "Fantastic Symphony," which fully depicts the scene of dreams. It is said that Berlioz was heartbroken and fell into deep depression. In that "Fantastic Symphony," he described killing his lover in his dream and seeing many gorgeous scenes and the dance of witches.

"It is a mistake to judge the appreciation of music based on the associations and images it evokes." I think this sentence is correct, because the alienation of musical images is greater than that of painting and other arts. Music can never grasp a clear image. You say that this section of music describes the setting sun, but why can't it also describe the moon setting in the west or the sorrow of being lovelorn? This is because sound can describe the atmosphere, such as excitement and sadness, but cannot describe things. (i.e., clear images.) The same text about music also says: "When appreciating a high-level music, I only feel intoxicated and immersed in it, forgetting the world and myself, and being guided by the god of music into the infinite realm of supreme beauty." I think music is just pure music, nothing else. In fact, being intoxicated and immersed in music is like being intoxicated in a dream, and this supreme and beautiful realm is both joy and sorrow. Perhaps this feeling is just far-fetched.

### On the Jialing River

— Carved by Renfeng

### Musing

— Han Yang

Those who have seen the Qiantang River tide know how magnificent and surging it is, how captivating its momentum. But I always feel it's not as good as the delicate sea tide striking the rocky shore, producing subtle and winding sounds.

One year, I spent some time in a small coastal city in Shandong. Behind my residence was the sea, an endless expanse of blue. Opening the back window allowed the briny sea breeze to blow freely on my face, on the potted flowers I kept on my desk, and on my whole heart. It wasn't so much a feeling of joy as it was of intoxication; indeed, the salty sea breeze, neither fierce nor weak, containing a kind of strength, was truly something with emotion. Every time I stood at the window, I thought that it wasn't I who was receiving the sea breeze's favor, but that it was swallowing me up. It truly seeped into my blood like wine.

But even more intoxicating than the sea breeze was the sound of the tide every evening and early morning. The sea is so vast that when the tide rises, it makes no particular splash, like a wise and profound person whose emotions, even when surging, remain unmoved, leaving us unable to fathom their depths. The only news reporting the tide's arrival is the delicate murmur, beating in slow rhythm, gently crashing on the rocky shore. That sound is like a low whisper, like repeated reminders, like a poet savoring his soaring imagination, like a lover using tender words to knock on the other's heart, like… No, I have no appropriate words to compare it to, only feeling that it is so full of emotions, endlessly lingering. It makes me melancholy, makes me dreamy, awakens me from sleep, and allows me to create more beautiful, fantastic, thrilling, and boundless dreams.

From then on, I learned how to live, learned how to settle my own emotions.

Human nature's relationship to life is probably like the soul's mastery over a person. A person without a soul doesn't know how to nourish their own heart with human nature. Even if the material conditions are exceptionally abundant, they still won't know how to live.

Thus, the meaning of so-called life lies in creating an atmosphere of human interest, and then receiving the various flavors of sweetness and bitterness it gives us. We live simply because we live, so what reason do we have to demand a better situation? Therefore, true living should start from within, from the inside out and then back inward. Only from these places can the true manifestation of human nature be found.

Although sometimes I also admire a kind of ardent and straightforward emotion, such as crying loudly for a while when heartbroken, or singing or shouting as much as possible when happy, it really has a liberating effect on our lives. But human strength is limited; using it too much at once, or using it slowly over a long period, results in the same amount of energy expended in our lives. The difference lies in the effect on life. On our "life phase," especially in modern times, the distress of life, which is also the distress of humanity, is unanimously acknowledged by everyone who has questioned their own soul. Therefore, I must say that, at least in this current stage, a true "optimist" does not exist. Because the various aspects of romance on the stage of life still lack the conditions to make us produce true "optimists." Nowadays, some people in society claim to be "optimists," enjoying themselves regardless of everything, letting music, alcohol, and neon lights play with their senses. In reality, they don't understand optimism, they are just, as Hakuson Kushida said, mocking life. They don't use their "true heart" to respond to life, but instead hold a playful attitude, which is indeed another manifestation of "nihilism." Nothing is more tragic than a dead heart. I always feel that those who put life and their own heart at a great distance, and who have even lost the ability to welcome "doubt," have some indescribable sadness. In addition, there is another type of person who, with a belly full of tears, abnormally uses enjoyment to numb themselves. I recently met such a friend who boldly mocks life, mocks the people around her and herself, but I notice that her emotions, which are aroused from time to time, often make her cry for no apparent reason. This is naturally full of "human interest," naturally "human," but for some reason, I still feel that it is not a normal life. All abnormal lives are deformed, extreme, and pitiful. After a burst of joy and excessive tension, it is not difficult to imagine what follows. Therefore, I would rather prefer and admire a higher and greater wisdom, an immeasurable wit sufficient to lead emotions to follow a normal human nature.

The sea is too vast, so the tide is not obvious; the mouth of the Qiantang River is large among rivers, but compared to the sea, it is much smaller. Therefore, the tide that seems insignificant in the sea becomes surging and agitated once it enters the mouth of the Qiantang River. The tide is emotion, it is "human nature." The sea does not reject it, but being able to integrate it to the point of "insignificance" is the sea's true greatness.

People with emotion but lacking wit often tend to be superficial and vulgar; people with reason but lacking emotion often tend to be cunning and cold. In order to achieve a perfect attitude towards life, in order to nourish one's own heart with "human interest," it is necessary to add wit to emotion and integrate the two into one. The loveliness of "human nature" requires both emotion and wit; the greatness of "human nature" can only be truly manifested after possessing both "witty emotions" and "emotional wit."

The charm of emotion can only be tasted from "lingering." Loud crying is never as heartbreaking as quiet sobbing; unrestrained laughter is never as moving as a knowing smile. This is the same principle as the surging tide in the Qiantang River being inferior to the fragmented sound of the waves striking the rocky shore. Hiding emotion deep in the heart, not wasting it or consuming it, and then, at the appropriate time, carefully taking out a portion, just a part of it, and making it appear wearing a coat of wit, that is undoubtedly the most lovely state on the "life" stage. So-called "humor," so-called "human nature," should refer to this. People do not need any "satisfaction," what people need is a kind of "lingering," a kind of lingering and repeated charm to infinity. Just as we would never want to swallow any delicious food in one gulp, but would rather hold a small portion in our mouth and chew it repeatedly. Blandness is not good, but too much or too intense flavor, or too much satisfaction, will also make people tired. Therefore, the Chinese pay attention to "tea tasting" and abhor "gulping it down," and life is the same way. Emotion is the deliciousness of life, but those who swallow it whole or those who greedily eat a little and want to eat enough are no different from harming themselves and depriving themselves of the meaning of life. They are the ones who understand life the least.

Understanding this, we should understand the source of literature and art, etc. Hakuson Kushida said that the appreciation of literature is based on "one's own discovery," that is, readers appreciate a work in order to discover themselves from it. I fully agree with this view. The essence of "life" is actually just an appreciation of the self of life. What can make people produce "self-appreciation of life" is the most "human" place, and also the most lingering place. The more it is like this, the more people can feel the true existence of life, and the more they have the leisure to appreciate it. Literature and art probably start from here. The reason why tragedy is more popular than comedy is because emotions are vented too quickly, "satisfaction" closes the door of "lingering" and ends the flow of "human nature." Any story, any image, once it reaches the step of "satisfaction," is finished, it is useless, and it will no longer arouse people's interest. A couple, if they have a smooth union and live happily together, will not become a moving story, and can never become the subject of a novel, because there is a lack of expression of "human nature" here, and it cannot make others discover "themselves." But if a marital change occurs between him and her, people will immediately pay attention, their life will immediately become "story-like," because they will only then have to display the most real "human nature" they possess, which also contains the life of others.

"The art of life" should be sought here. A person who is good at managing his own life should, like a novelist seeking moving themes everywhere, also seek everywhere for the content of life that is sufficient to make emotions linger. The loveliness of life, the enjoyment of life, must be here, I firmly believe.

The melody in music, the quivering tone in poetry, the use of light in painting, aren't they all showing the ability of art in "lingering"? Therefore, I want to say: the essence of art is a kind of "lingering," but "lingering" is not the independence of art, it is completely in response to people's demands for life.

A normal life should be in line with the requirements of art, it should be a lingering "self-appreciation" of life.

This truth is what the sea told me. Artists, I think they all understand this principle, but they just haven't clearly pointed it out.

The great 19th-century writer Leo Tolstoy had this experience. When he lived in Yasnaya Polyana in his later years, he hired a young music teacher for his son to learn the violin, and every night he played Beethoven's famous pieces. Unexpectedly, the great writer was deeply moved by Beethoven's music. Every evening, he listened to the young musician's performance with tears in his eyes. Sometimes, he was so excited that he couldn't sit still, and he opened the window to breathe the outside air. As a result, he wrote a novel called "The Kreutzer Sonata," which was his attack on modern marriage after listening to Beethoven's Kreutzer Sonata. The matter seems strange, that Tolstoy would think of the hypocrisy of the marriage system from the emotion of music. But if you understand the principles I mentioned earlier, you will think it is a very natural result and not strange at all.

The essence of "love," like art, is just a kind of "lingering," a kind of "lingering of life." In the process of love between men and women, their hearts are completely artistic. They constantly discover themselves and enjoy the joy of "self-appreciation of life" from the baptism of each other's love. Therefore, a person only feels the extraordinariness and preciousness of their own life when leaning on their lover's chest. The "love" received from a lover is a beautiful mirror, it not only allows you to recognize your own tenderness, soft heart, hearing, and wisdom, not only makes you coquettish like a child, with nerves as sensitive as a hunting dog, and thoughts as meticulous as a goblin, but it can also make you perceive some latent heat and the truth of human nature hidden in your heart that you would not normally perceive. Therefore, "love" is a job, an artistic job. When you fall in love with someone, this job begins, you are doing the "excavation" of the "soul." On the one hand, you are excavating the soul of your lover, but on the other hand, you are becoming more aware of yourself because your soul is being excavated by your lover, and there is infinite "lingering" in between. That's why I often say: "Love is an art." Lovers use a force of "love" that integrates high wit and high skill to explore each other's souls, which is exactly the same as music using melody, poetry using trembling, and painting using light and line to explore people's souls. Moreover, the meaning of accepting each other's "love" is just like what we accept from music, poetry, painting, novels, etc. The only joy lies in "one's own discovery," in the "self-appreciation of life." Therefore, "love" is the purer the better, it must be removed from the demands and satisfaction of carnal desires in order to reach the realm of art. "Love" is the more tortuous the better, the more repeated and lingering to infinity the better, the reason is just like this.

But society does not allow people to enjoy the happiness of "love" for a long time, the marriage system is saying that after lovers have gone through a period of lingering, they should end it, and then he and she must marry. Marriage is a kind of "satisfaction," and it is precisely the cessation of the work of "excavating the soul," it is actually what is generally said to be the "tomb of love." A pair of lovers, if they always maintain the form of "love," the preparation of each other's souls is endless, as if both sides have infinite treasures, constantly enticing you to explore and yet inexhaustible, then the lingering of love will be endless. But they got married, once they got married, they both said, "This is all I have, everything is here, take it quickly." Then "love" is buried. Lovers are the union of souls, couples are the union of society, and our present society cannot become "couples" without killing "lovers." This is the truth that Tolstoy discovered: "Modern marriage is completely hypocritical"!

Beethoven's "Kreutzer Sonata," I have not yet had the blessing to hear, but I can always imagine that it is endlessly lingering. We need the lingering of life, we need the "soul" to be "excavated," so we love music, we love all art. But the depth of our lives, there are some places that art is also powerless to excavate, only leaning on the lover's chest can it be accomplished, so we are even more in demand of the love between the sexes. Therefore, Tolstoy felt from the "lingering" of "Kreutzer Sonata" that the lingering of "love" is indispensable, and therefore was indignant at the hypocrisy of modern marriage in burying "love." Isn't this path very natural? Isn't it proving the meaning of "life" that I said above?

### Worldliness

— Ke Feng

Have you had this experience? Strolling alone on a deserted street, shrouding a weary mood in the twilight's ambiguity; or bearing some pointless urgency, hurrying along a noisy sidewalk, when suddenly, a pair of widened eyes fix on you. They stare for a moment, and then a pair of sweaty hands cling tightly together – an exchange of heat, nerves vibrating, yet each remains speechless.

This wouldn't stem from a contrived affectation. You might say, "No one's emotions are as easily stirred or as prone to overflow as they once were." Indeed, after these years of turbulence, of hardships and trials, no one knows where to begin talking!

My friend and I faced each other in such silence. When our eyes met again, he smiled. I suddenly felt empty. The twitch of his mouth, the crinkle of his eyes – everything was familiar to me, but that smile no longer held the brightness of a "May day." Naturally, I smiled too, a touch of astringency on the tip of my tongue. My smile was bitter as well.

"You've aged!"

But my friend had a more subtle way of putting it: "Looking at your face, you've become much more worldly."

"Much more worldly!" This should be considered a more "worldly" way of speaking. I couldn't help but shudder.

Preserving the sins learned furtively while adrift in the sea of humanity; replacing assistance and compassion with competition and oppression; exchanging lies and deception for the good intentions of others; painting conscience in various colors, selling it off piece by piece; leading people to mistake white for black, and black for white; housing a ghost in one's own shell as a substitute for one's soul... These, these are signs of being "much more worldly"?

To superiors, showing servile deference, obsequious flattery; to subordinates, displaying authoritarian power, arrogant demeanor; sketching out a complete repertoire of pleading, ingratiating, flattering, bootlicking, hypocritical benevolence, selfish generosity, or frightening, cruel, and poisonous faces, to be used at any time; memorizing an entire set of lines, comparing the world to a stage, painstakingly training oneself to become an even more outstanding character than the famous actors on stage. Does this also belong to being "worldly"?

More pitiful are those who tremble fearfully in the dog-eat-dog world, following the shadows of others, saying black is black and white is white; daring neither to laugh loudly nor to cry freely; having no share in joy, and not daring to utter a word of resentment. They shut their souls in tightly sealed iron cages, allowing them to become numb, to die; they are even more preoccupied with watching the expressions of others, for the faces of others are the foundation of their own "personality." Is there "worldliness" here, too?

"Your face reveals a deep worldliness."

Is it like an old gun, the face stained with smoke that cannot be concealed?

Those who initially thought they were learning to swim and were pleased with themselves in the ups and downs of the world, you have only contracted a body full of viruses, stained with a body full of sins!

"Looking at your face, you've become much more worldly." I look at my friend, he too has aged.

Beneath those "worldlinesses," youth is eroded, and the soul is darkened. Grasping my friend's hand tightly, my nerves vibrating, I felt us both shuddering.

We could only offer a bitter smile.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng 34

Ping: Because national affairs are becoming increasingly urgent, Chairman Wei is summoning national worthies to Lushan for talks to discuss how to deal with the current situation.

Xin: According to my intelligence in Nanjing, the Jiang regime is ambitious and wants to confront me on a large scale. Now it is actively convening a military conference in Lushan. The intention to make war is very clear. O Imperial Army, purchasing and conscripting from China, now is the time! For the straw men of China to oppose my illustrious Imperial Army is no different than hitting a rock with an egg.

Ping: My Chairman secretly ordered Song Zheyuan on the 16th to quickly resolve the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin and relocate to Baoding to prepare for war.

Xin: The General Staff Headquarters of the Expeditionary Army secretly ordered that Nanjing intends to instigate Commander Song to act in unison. Now that Song in Tianjin has shown accord with my Kiyoshi Katsuki's military headquarters, I am making further demands and will not stop until my goal is achieved.

Ping: The Chairman issued an important statement on the current situation: (1) The National Government's foreign policy is to seek self-preservation internally and common interest externally, and to always cherish peace; (2) Lugou Bridge is the gateway to Beiping. The ability to end the Lugou Bridge Incident is the boundary of the final juncture; (3) When it comes to the final juncture, there is only resolute sacrifice, but I am only preparing for war, not seeking war; (4) Before peace is despaired of, I always hope for a peaceful solution, but I must adhere to the four minimum conditions: 1. Any solution must not infringe on China's sovereignty and territorial integrity; 2. The administrative organization of Hebei and Chahar must not undergo any illegal changes; 3. Local officials appointed by the Central Government, such as Song Zheyuan, Chairman of Hebei and Chahar, cannot be removed at anyone's request; 4. The area where the 29th Army is currently stationed cannot be subject to any restrictions.

Xin: The Nanjing regime has now launched a political and propaganda offensive, and its intention is to realize a policy of intimidation and to separate me from the relationship between the administration of Hebei and Chahar. In any case, I must still move forward without hesitation to implement the established policy of my cabinet chief. Commander Song Zheyuan's friendly actions towards me in Beiping today (July 19) show that Nanjing's alienation tactics are just the worries of mediocre people. …

Looking at the above telegrams in comparison, one can know the positions of Japan and us on the current situation that day: Japan was determined to implement aggression in order to realize the dream of controlling Greater East Asia; although we said that it had reached the final juncture, we still demanded peace and that it not infringe on our country's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

On this day, I inquired about the news of He'er from Changxindian twice in secret ways. The reply was always vague and asked me to return to my station quickly. Mr. W was of course very concerned about He'er's actions and the news of the "Seven Secret Machines." So in the evening, he no longer insisted on staying and let me set off to return to the station.

From Beiping to Changxindian, it is only a twenty or thirty minute train ride. It seems easy to find a way to return to Changxindian. Unfortunately, at this time, due to repeated armed conflicts between Japan and us, trains could no longer move freely. Furthermore, my whereabouts must not be known by the Japanese special service, because the Changxindian power station has not been disclosed to any Japanese agency. But I am anxious to return to my station, which is an ironclad fact.

Now there are only two paths for me to take. First, explore and advance step by step, taking one step and seeing what happens. If problems arise, deal with them as they come. Second, go to the Japanese special service branch in Beiping, look for opportunities, and apply one or two of the fifteen emergency methods we agreed upon with He'er to try my luck. Finally, I decided to take the second path; because the first path might not be able to reach my destination as desired, and it is more dangerous.

Upon arriving in Beiping, at the Japanese Special Service Branch – this unprecedented terror-manufacturing center – I met the local head using some name of the General Staff Headquarters. (The so-called tool of a certain name is just a headquarters badge and a verbally stated identity – of course, a temporary identity was created.) The situation of this meeting between the two sides is like the situation of a high official of the former Qing Dynasty patrolling and overriding the local officials. The local officials at the time had no way and did not dare to explore the authenticity of the Beijing officials, so they had to kneel to welcome and send them off.

### Revival of Street Vendors

— Shaofu

The street vendors in this city have disappeared after the city authorities' serious crackdown since September 1st; but the problem is that they have only "disappeared," not been completely resolved. (Here, "resolved" means resolving this matter, not solving the livelihood of the street vendors.)

Disappearing is only temporary, so they will "become more cunning over time"; in recent days, the vendors who once disappeared have gradually revived. Some are disintegrated into parts, abandoning their stalls and carrying many items for sale by hand (such as glass purses, etc.), selling and shouting on the streets; some are integrated into a whole, gathering in certain alleys to form a small commercial market.

We are well aware of the benefits of cracking down on street vendors: such as the city's new look, the gradual order of pedestrian traffic, the coming disappearance of the theft wind in the docks, and the greater benefits: making it easier for national products to find a way out, etc. But more important is also the widely known: the issue of street vendors changing careers. Just as when swatting flies, one must also pay attention to how to dispose of garbage.

We do not oppose cracking down on street vendors because of the difficulty of street vendors changing careers; but we believe that since the authorities have acted swiftly first, they must strive to implement it thoroughly afterwards; judging from the current situation of street vendors gradually reviving, the government has only done the first step. If it is allowed to continue, within half a month, the city's street vendors will still return to their old look, there is no doubt. So, why bother in the first place?

We hope that if we do nothing, then fine, but if we do, don't be a flash in the pan! It is certainly not easy for street vendors to change careers, but it is only not easy, not impossible! In any case, the government cannot allow the crackdown on street vendors on September 1st to become almost pointless!

Educational Issues

### Students Who Cheat Discuss Cheating

— Gu Yu

I am a student, and after reading Mr. Ling Ren’s "Discussing Cheating on Exams" on September 10th, I feel sad and ashamed because I am also a part of the cheating, and almost all of my classmates cheat. However, I am not entirely satisfied with what Mr. Ling Ren wrote.

The reasons for cheating that Mr. Ling Ren thinks students have are only half true, and I cannot agree with them because many are real-world problems.

Mr. Ling Ren said: "Please, educators, pay attention to this! Don't assume that students with good grades are necessarily more competent." In fact, haven't schools and educational experts already noticed this? Proposing a demerit for one instance of cheating, and expulsion for three instances, is useless. This is too passive because the tighter the control, the more sophisticated the students' cheating techniques become!

Moreover, cheating is now too widespread. I dare say that nine out of ten students cheat. Does this mean that all students are bad? Therefore, educational experts should pay attention to the current education system as a proactive solution. In schools nowadays, there are often seventy or eighty students in a class. Teachers are just going through the motions, and principals are making money. As a result, students also fool around and don't study. When exams come, some teachers deliberately make things difficult for students, making them fail, while others are afraid that their students' poor performance will bring them down, so they let them cheat. Thus, a culture of cheating is fostered. Therefore, the proactive approach should be to pay attention to teachers' qualifications, ensure students understand the material, and base grades on regular performance, reducing the pressure of exams. Then, students will naturally cheat less.

Furthermore, current scholarships are based on grades as the approval standard. Impoverished students are not necessarily good at their studies. I hope the education authorities and school authorities pay attention to this. Scholarship approvals should not be based on grades. Then, the culture of cheating can naturally be reduced again.

In addition to these two points, students should have the concept that scholarship comes first, and grades are irrelevant. This way, if there are only a few students who cheat, they can be eliminated as a detriment to the group. Students who cheat because other students cheat will naturally no longer do so.

[Editor's Note: Although there are reasons for the current trend of cheating, this is not something to be encouraged. Mr. Gu Yu's article can be used as a reference for the authorities, but not as a justification for students who cheat! We oppose cheating in any situation, just as public officials cannot use "too little income" as a reason for corruption! Otherwise, everything bad will become excusable!]

### Learning from Merchants

— Cheng Zhi, translated from the September issue of Reader's Digest

King George V of England was known for his thrift and wanted to instill the same virtue in his descendants. However, Prince Wilson, on the contrary, preferred to spend money. Once, when he was studying at school, he wrote to his father requesting extra expenses. Unexpectedly, in the reply, he was severely reprimanded and instructed to change his ways and learn more from merchants. As a result, the King saw in the next letter: "...I have decided to take your advice and have sold your letter to a collector, earning twenty-five pounds..."

### Divorce Because of Kisses

— Xu Ying, translated from Continental News

Ms. Dix is an expert on difficult issues between men and women and has long been considered an authority. Below is her recent work elucidating "the art of kissing."

Recently, a divorce case occurred where the husband claimed that his wife always asked him for five U.S. dollars every time she kissed him. This was pure extortion, and therefore, such a wife was unacceptable. The wife, however, admitted it directly but said that it didn't necessarily have to be five dollars; she could be flexible with whatever amount her husband had.

As to whether the husband thought that kissing between husband and wife was a divinely granted right, and therefore unwilling to pay unnecessary black market prices because of his wife's demands, or whether the wife disliked her husband's woodpecker-like kisses and considered them superfluous, so she came up with this method to slightly restrict them, we have not yet learned the details. The magistrate hearing the case may be racking his brains over this question and feel strange that such a thing could have such a serious impact on married life.

We will temporarily not discuss whether a kiss with one's wife is worth five dollars. What we should pay attention to now is a cause of pain in marital relationships. For this, many wives have shed countless tears. This is why men's attitudes towards kissing their wives are so different before and after marriage.

For this reason, it is no wonder that wives always suspect why their husbands always treat kissing as an obligation and why their kisses are always cold.

The reason why kisses between husband and wife are cold is probably because they happen every day, so they feel ordinary and unremarkable. Common habits dictate that couples should kiss dozens of times a day. We seem to treat kissing as a habit, but we neglect another truth: a kiss during the tenderest moment, when love reaches its climax, is more valuable than millions of woodpecker-like kisses!

Things are valued when they are rare. So, the wife who asked her husband for five dollars for a kiss is smarter than those women who ask their husbands as they leave home, "Hey! Are you leaving like that? You forgot to do something."

### Cherish School Reputation, Protect Academic Integrity

— Jian Zhi

During lunch on the 11th, the chairman of the Student Union reported an interesting piece of news: "In order to uphold strict exams and promote academic integrity, we are petitioning the principal. Please sign if you agree."

Immediately, people put down their rice bowls and rushed to sign their names, forming a swarm. Two large sheets of white paper were quickly filled with signatures.

It is because of strict exams that Fudan has its current status, climbing to the level of a second-tier national university.

"Just roll up your bedding and you can get in." This was the common perception of private Fudan in the past.

How can the school reputation, which was painstakingly earned over eight years, be allowed to go to waste in one day? Every member of Fudan has such concerns, leading to today's petition to the principal.

Whether past glory and future brilliance can be maintained and promoted is a rare test.

What is even more hoped for is that the efforts of Fudan students will influence the entire academic atmosphere of Shanghai, correct the general malpractices of examinations, and bring a new perspective to the Shanghai education community. Then, today's action will have an immortal significance!

### Office Assistant in the Post Office

— Xin Cheng

Office assistant – listening to instructions and being dispatched by others; if we speculate on this profession solely based on the meaning of the words "office assistant," then the work of an office assistant is very lowly. Currently, in the Shanghai Post Office, besides the mail carriers, there are also a group of office assistants. Their number is only one-fifth of the number of mail carriers. Although they are both considered "service workers" in name, their income is far less than that of mail carriers. Before August 13th, because of the generous treatment of the post office and the frequent opportunities for promotion, there were always many applicants for each post office exam, whether for postal clerks, postal assistants, mail carriers, or office assistants. The applicants were satisfied just to be able to step through the door. They thought that after working as an office assistant for one or two years, they could become a postal assistant, then a postal clerk, then a postal director. This was the hope of office assistants and the hope of everyone working in the postal service.

Do not despise an office assistant in the Shanghai Post Office. It is not unheard of in the history of the post office for someone to become a director starting as an office assistant! One of the leaders in the Shanghai labor community today, who holds a very important position, also started as an office assistant! Regarding the daily work of office assistants, because the post office organization is large and complex, their work mostly involves delivering official documents and letters between various departments within the bureau. In recent years, due to the post office suspending exams, partly because the Shanghai postal authorities are aware of the level of Shanghai office assistants, selling stamps, selling stamp duty, sorting mail... (the work of postal clerks and assistants) is also slowly being shared by office assistants. Indeed, many office assistants are competent enough to be compared with clerks and assistants. Especially the few who were recruited in 1939, most of them are still in their twenties. Among them, there is Lao Gu, who studied industrial technology and is called an "engineer," and Xiao Luo, who is about to graduate from Shanghai University and is called an "accountant." It may be a loss to society for a university or technical college graduate to work as an office assistant, but temporarily unable to find a better-paying position, they can only look forward to a bright future. This group of young office assistants does not become passive because of the difficult and low-status work they do every day. They have organized a "Sincerity Association" to connect with each other, enhance their knowledge and skills, and promote a spirit of mutual assistance. "Where there is sincerity, metal and stone will be opened." This is their ambition today. Perhaps in ten or twenty years, there will be several directors or several labor leaders emerging from this group of office assistants!

Finally, I have a statement: my motivation for writing this article is definitely not to specifically praise them, but to hope that society should not underestimate these unsung heroes too much, and society should reward those with promising futures and diligent workers and should pay special attention to them!

### John Leighton Stuart, Friend of China, Religious Leader, Educator

— Qian Fanfu

The family environment during childhood influenced and determined the life of John Leighton Stuart: His family was a mixed organization of a school, hospital, religion, and society. He was nurtured and cultivated from an early age, shaping his character as an educator and the piety of a missionary.

(Family of Educators) Tracing the family history of Dr. Stuart: His great-grandfather, Stuart Robert, was the president of a university in Kentucky, USA. His grandfather, Stuart Todd, founded "Stuart University" in the same place, which was the first women's university in the state. His father, Stuart John, was one of the earliest missionaries to China. Seeing the backward state of education in China at the time, he established a primary school in Hangzhou. However, to adhere to the church's regulations and focus on preaching doctrine, the school was closed not long after it opened.

It was at this time—1876 AD—that Stuart was born in Hangzhou. His mother's name was Mary Horton. Like the wives of other missionaries, she possessed extraordinary talent and perseverance. When she moved to Beijing with her husband and children, she served as a housewife, seamstress, doctor, nurse, and teacher. Her kindness, gentleness, and fervor deeply imprinted her personality on everyone's heart. Leighton's moral character was influenced by excellent influences early in life.

(Grew up in China) Leighton was the eldest son, and he and his siblings learned to speak like Chinese children. He lived with his parents among the Chinese people. It was not until he was eleven years old that he was sent back to the United States. He felt strange and different in his home country, but he overcame all difficulties with courage and patience.

After five years back home, he became accustomed to the new environment. In 1892, he entered Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia. Among the courses, he was most interested in Greek and Latin, and from that time on, he began to admire the life of teaching. After graduation, he returned to his alma mater, "Pantops Academy," and taught for three years.

In 1899, he entered Union Theological Seminary to study. After graduating, he and two classmates traveled as clergymen in the southern United States and raised funds for the church, achieving unexpected success. One of the two classmates was later David McConnell, who came to China with Dr. Stuart. These two like-minded young men met the Lott sisters and, within a year, the two couples held their weddings on the same day.

(Honeymoon in West Lake) The date of the Stuart couple's wedding was November 1904. One month after their wedding, they went to Hangzhou together. Two years later, their only son, Stuart Lee, was born in China (he later became a pastor).

After Dr. Stuart returned to Hangzhou, he joined his father's work as a preacher for three years, followed by his appointment as a professor of theology in Nanjing. He taught at the Nanjing school for a total of eleven years. The quiet school life made him happy. During this period, he published Chinese works such as "Required Reading of the New Testament in the Original Language," "New Commentary on the Revelation of the New Testament," and "The Substitute for War."

In 1918, Stuart was hired as the president of Yenching University in Beijing. In the early stages of "Yenching University," there were only a hundred students, and financial difficulties forced him to raise funds from the outside world. "Yenching University" turned from danger to safety several times, all thanks to his efforts. Therefore, he would jokingly say to people, "Whenever I see a beggar, I always feel that I am in the same business as them."

In total, Dr. John Leighton Stuart preached and taught in China for thirty years. His contribution to the education community in our country can be said to be the first foreign meritorious person. This July, at the age of seventy, he took office as the U.S. Ambassador to China, working hard without fear of hardship. The friendship he has given to China will not be forgotten by the Chinese people!
