### Government Reorganization Under Discussion: Second Plenary Session to Make Preliminary Decision

[Our Newspaper Chongqing Eighth Dispatch] The issue of government reorganization is still under deliberation, and no formal lists have been submitted by any party. Wu Dingchang, representing the government, exchanged opinions with all parties the day before yesterday. Various parties are in a wait-and-see state, all awaiting the outcome of the Second Plenary Session before deciding on candidates to participate in the government. Therefore, the government reorganization currently has majority support, with only insistence on the Five-Power Constitution in the draft constitution chapter. As for personnel matters within the government, there are also various rumors. According to information obtained from various sources, changes are indeed expected in the government's departmental personnel, and there will also be organizational adjustments. It is possible that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Food will be merged. The organization of the Ministry of Interior will definitely be expanded, and a preliminary decision will be made by the Second Plenary Session. Once coordination with all parties is completed, it will be announced, and the government's candidates can then be formally decided.

[United Press Chongqing Eighth Dispatch] It is rumored in the temporary capital today that a large National Government council will be formed by the end of this month, but the forty members plan to resign en masse before the council is formed. Many members of the Central Executive Committee consistently believe that the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference made excessive concessions to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and other parties, and have therefore continuously criticized them. However, Chairman Chiang insisted on adoption, which is expected to be approved by the Second Plenary Session. Since the convening of this plenary session on March 1, the government itself and several important officials, such as Foreign Minister Wang, have been directly criticized. Several members accused the government of mishandling the takeover of Northeast China and were dissatisfied with Xiong Shihui, the director of the Northeast Headquarters, advocating for his removal and replacement by Minister of Military Administration Chen Cheng. Furthermore, Premier Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan, in his initial report on the political and economic situation at the Second Plenary Session today, stated: After the implementation of the new foreign trade regulations, concrete results can be seen in two months, great achievements in four months, and the economic foundation can be declared stable by the end of this year.

### Premier Song Reports on Political and Economic Situation: Will Not Shirk Responsibility, But Must Reflect on the Past and Plan for the Future

[Central News Agency Chongqing Eighth Dispatch] The tenth meeting of the Second Plenary Session was held on the eighth. Apart from the transportation report, most of the time was spent in a heated review of the political report. The meeting began at 3:20 PM, with 203 members in attendance, chaired by Committee Member He Yingqin. First, Zhang Daofan, representing the presidium, reported that the presidium had received a temporary motion from 110 members regarding the National Assembly issue in the Political Consultative Conference report. He was designated to explain it on behalf of the presidium. After he finished reading the explanation, the proposer believed that since the presidium had explained the case in detail, there was no need to put it to a discussion, and automatically withdrew it. The chairman, according to the agenda, announced the review of the political report. However, Premier Song Ziwen was not present at the time due to other business, so the transportation issue was brought forward for reporting. Minister of Transportation Yu Feipeng reported on railways, highways, shipping, ships, and postal and telecommunications. He finished at 4:40 PM. After the break, the review of politics began. The speakers included LÃ¼ Yunzhang, Hu Shuhua, Ma Yuanfang, Yuan Yong, Li Zonghuang, Luo Gonghua, Hu Qiuyuan, Huang Yuren, and Zhong Tianxin. The focus of the review was still on personnel systems, administrative efficiency, and economic and financial issues. Later, Premier Song himself responded separately. The Secretariat announced the list of members of the Political Report Review Committee. The conveners were Li Wenfan, Gu Zhenglun, and Fan Yushui. The Ninth Session of the Plenary session convened again on the 9th in both the morning and the afternoon, and adjourned at 6:15 pm.

[Central News Agency Chongqing Eighth Dispatch] The ninth meeting of the Second Plenary Session was held on the morning of the eighth. Premier Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan gave a political report, the original text of which is as follows: Chairman, fellow comrades, I have been instructed today to give a political report. The political aspect includes many departments. The Executive Yuan has already printed general work reports and distributed them to all comrades for review. The main departments, such as foreign affairs, economics, and finance, have also been reported orally at the conference by the responsible comrades of each department. What I am reporting today is the most urgent and serious issue at the moment, and it is also the issue that everyone is most concerned about, which is the economic issue. It can be said that everyone is dissatisfied with the current economic situation. This is inevitable. Even I, personally, feel that not only am I not satisfied, but I am also one of the most dissatisfied people. However, I absolutely do not mean to shirk responsibility. Now, I am reporting the facts to all comrades. History teaches us that without the past, there cannot be the present, and without the present, there cannot be the future. Therefore, to talk about the economic situation, we must reflect on the past, understand the present, and then plan for the future.

Coping with the Final Battle: Expenditures are Increasing Daily

I was appointed to take charge of the Executive Yuan on December 4th of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944]. At that time, the Japanese army was advancing towards Guiyang. It was the most dangerous stage of our War of Resistance. At that time, unfortunately, we continued to lose Henan and Hunan. Henan, which produces wheat, and Hunan, which produces rice, were both the most important food supply areas in the rear. Furthermore, we successively lost most of Guangdong and Guangxi, cutting off the connection between the rear and the southeastern provinces. The area of financial revenue had been reduced to relying only on Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces. At the same time, we had to urgently mobilize troops, deploy defenses, recruit new soldiers, replenish vacancies, and dispatch all kinds of materials to cope with the final battle. Expenditures inflated day by day, and revenues decreased day by day. The dangerous situation was truly at its extreme. In the spring of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], the situation stabilized slightly. The Allied forces achieved victories on all fronts, and the National Army was actively preparing for a counteroffensive. Military expenditures became even more enormous. At that time, all parties believed that the treatment of soldiers was too poor and that the troops could not be fully fed. Therefore, military expenditures had to be increased several times. However, revenues could not be increased. Under these difficult circumstances, the government, in order to achieve victory, could almost be said to be coping with the current situation bare-handed, and could only rely on issuing banknotes to make up for the insufficient revenue. This situation naturally caused prices to soar. We also all know that since the beginning of the War of Resistance, the enemy occupied our country's economic key points, and we relied on issuing currency to compensate for year-by-year accumulation. The gap between revenue and expenditure increased day by day, and at the same time, the area using legal tender shrank day by day. The magnitude of this danger was clear to everyone. Fortunately, the people of the whole country were able to deeply understand the righteousness and endure all the hardships of wartime, and thus achieved the day of victory in the War of Resistance. However, we must pay attention to the fact that although the War of Resistance was victorious and the war was over, the material and personnel losses and financial damage suffered during such a long period of resistance have led to the economic difficulties we face today.

The Economies of Britain and France Faced Similar Difficulties After the War

We must understand that economic difficulties often do not manifest during wartime, but are realized after the end of the war. The situation after the First World War is still fresh in our memory. The economic shock after this great war was naturally even more severe than the first. Let us look at France. French industry was almost completely undamaged by the Germans, because after Germany occupied France, it also used French industry to manufacture military equipment. Furthermore, Germany surrendered before Japan. However, today, France's economic difficulties have reached an extreme. Take Britain as another example. British territory was never occupied by the enemy, and yet, due to economic factors, even after the war ended, rations were still distributed by head count. Furthermore, the nutrition enjoyed by the British people today is even lower than it was during wartime. Our country has undergone eight years of resistance, and the damage suffered is heavier than in any other country. It is like a person who has been ill for a long time, who cannot be cured by a single dose of medicine, nor can health be restored in a day or two.

Four Main Reasons for Our Country's Economic Instability

Speaking of the reasons for our country's economic instability, there are of course many, but the main ones are no more than the following four:

First, all important materials were consumed over a long period during the War of Resistance, coupled with the enemy's blockade. Although there were airlifted supplies, the transportation capacity was ultimately limited. On average, less than 1,000 tons of civilian materials were transported to the country each month. As for the enemy's plunder in the occupied areas, and because production decreased, materials were also extremely scarce. Therefore, the supply of materials nationwide could not be balanced, and prices naturally rose.

Second, during the War of Resistance, the rear area shrank, and revenues naturally decreased, while expenditures increased day by day. The government relied on increasing issuance to compensate. Therefore, the more issuance, the higher the prices, and the more government expenditures increased, so it had to increase issuance again, thus creating a cyclical cause and effect. By the time the war ended and the occupied areas were recovered one by one, the increase in income had not yet been realized, while the expenditure on recovery was very large, requiring more issuance, and the stimulus to prices was therefore particularly profound.

Third, in terms of transportation, due to the long-term war, the enemy's destruction, and the economic blockade, transportation equipment gradually decreased, and the efficiency of transporting materials also declined day by day, almost reaching a state of complete stagnation. (To be continued)

[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco Eighth Broadcast says: The Beiping Mediation Executive Department today formally issued an ultimatum to the Communist troops in southern Rehe, demanding that the Communist troops withdraw one hundred miles north of Pingquan in southern Rehe to the area northwest of Chifeng. If the Communist troops do not accept the order, they will bear the responsibility for starting a civil war.

(2) The public shall be allowed to move freely or pass freely within military areas for the purpose of trade and agricultural production. (3) People in or passing through the above-mentioned areas shall not carry weapons. Those suspected of carrying weapons may be inspected.

[Also by telegraph] The principles of relieving the siege of Zaozhuang and restoring production have been determined, and technical issues are currently being discussed. The Transportation Group will go to Zaozhuang with the Xuzhou Group to discuss the organization of the Mining Area Production Committee together. It was unanimously agreed that there would be one representative from the government, one from the Communist army, one from the Transportation Group, and one technical representative from the mining area. The current dispute is over the area of the demilitarized zone.

[United Press Chongqing Eighth Dispatch] News from the CCP side here claims that the Linfen Executive Group in Jin Province has agreed that the government and the Communist armies in the four nearby areas will each retreat to their original positions as of January 13.

### Soviet Troops in Shenyang Begin to Move North: Concealed Communist Troops Have Entered the City to Operate

[Our Newspaper Changchun Seventh Dispatch] Shenyang Telephone: Soviet troops in Shenyang began to move north on the 7th. The Soviet authorities in Changchun negotiated with us, intending to borrow the barracks that we had previously repaired, but were unsuccessful.

(2) We have been notified to take over the Yunhe Railway Bridge, ten kilometers south of the city. (3) The Soviet troops on the Shenyang-Fushun line have also withdrawn. (4) There are also Soviet military vehicles from Dalian transporting to Shenyang. Generally speaking, it seems possible that the Soviet troops may suddenly leave Shenyang or southern Manchuria. Under these circumstances, the concealed Communist troops seem to be becoming active. Armed men in plain clothes have been discovered in the city of Shenyang, and the police authorities are planning countermeasures. Also, at 3:00 PM today, a major fire broke out at the Fuji Electric Company, which was formerly operated by the Japanese in the western district. The site was a Soviet warehouse. The fire was raging, and our police went to rescue, but were blocked by the Soviet troops. It is said that there was a lot of material stored inside.

### French Troops Land in Northern Vietnam: Situation Calms After Franco-Vietnamese Treaty Signed

[United Press Saigon Eighth Dispatch] The French military command announced today that the First and Eleventh Corps of the French occupying forces have landed in Tonkin Province, northern Vietnam, and the Chinese occupying forces have not offered further resistance.

A notice jointly signed by Ho Chi Minh, chairman of the Vietnamese Provisional Government, and Senteny, the French commissioner to northern Vietnam, and the commander-in-chief of the French army in Vietnam, has been posted all over the streets.

### Key Points of the Franco-Vietnamese Agreement

[United Press Washington Eighth Dispatch] According to Geneva sources here, the agreement concluded between France and the Vietnamese Nationalist Party "has very generous terms."

(2) To implement economic autonomy, changing Vietnam's trade with France to trade with China, and to promote Sino-Vietnamese trade relations, such as the import of Vietnamese rice and coal into China. (3) To establish a federal Vietnamese army, with Vietnamese people serving as officers. (4) To organize local autonomous governments; and (5) To establish autonomous police forces.

### Marshall Returns to the U.S. from Geneva; Wedemeyer Arrives in Shanghai from Chongqing and Will Go to Beiping Tomorrow; Soviet ChargÃ© d'Affaires Visits the U.S. Secretary of State to Deliver a Reply to the U.S. Note

[United Press, Chongqing, 8th] It was learned tonight: General Marshall, who has just returned from inspecting the areas of military conflict in China, is preparing to leave China for the United States on March 12. According to reliable sources, Lieutenant General Wedemeyer, Commander of U.S. Forces in the China Theater, also plans to return to the U.S. within this month. Some observers have recently speculated that Wedemeyer might take over Marshall's work of supervising the reorganization and reduction of the Chinese army. However, well-informed sources believe that General Marshall will return to China to continue his mission until the Chinese army is reorganized. Neither Marshall nor Wedemeyer has made any statement regarding the possible duration of their stay in China. It is expected that General Wedemeyer will meet with Marshall, Lieutenant General Gillem, and Brigadier General Caraway, Commander of U.S. Forces in Chongqing, this weekend.

[United Press, Chongqing, 8th] It is rumored that General Marshall is currently discussing a visit to various parts of the Northeast in coordination with the U.S. State Department's decision to break the deadlock on the "Northeast issue." If this rumor is true, Marshall will face the most difficult task of his mission to China, and perhaps the most challenging of his life.

[Our Newspaper] General Wedemeyer, Commander-in-Chief of U.S. Forces in China, returned to Shanghai from Chongqing yesterday. He is scheduled to meet with reporters at 11:00 a.m. today on the eighth floor of the Construction Building. He will go to Beiping tomorrow or next Monday.

[United Press, Washington, 7th] Secretary of State Byrnes instructed the chargÃ© d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow to present a note to the Soviet government regarding the activities of the Red Army in the Nine Eastern Provinces of China. The State Department did not release this note at the same time as the note on the Iranian issue. It is said that this is because it is not yet known whether the Soviet government has received the note, and therefore it has been postponed. Soviet ChargÃ© d'Affaires in Washington, Novikov, visited Byrnes this afternoon. Neither side has made any statement about what was discussed, but Novikov was seen carrying a briefcase containing official documents, which may have been a reply from the Soviet Union regarding the Iranian and Northeast China events. Novikov told reporters that he could not disclose the nature of the meeting and was very sorry. When a reporter asked him to comment on the current world situation, he replied, "Some reporters seem to like to hear bad news and hate to hear good news." A State Department official said that the recent U.S. overt expressions on world affairs are not only directed at the Soviet Union, but also a new approach for the U.S. to deal with international events, hoping to force a quick and peaceful showdown. Past secret diplomacy only caused suspicion and did not help the overall situation. MacArthur Headquarters announced

### Japan's Exports to China and Korea to Assist in Industrial Recovery

As of the end of February, China had imported 800,000 mulberry seedlings and 24,000 sheets of silkworm eggs from Japan, which are awaiting shipment to China.

### Truman Announces: The Anglo-American Joint Chiefs of Staff Will Continue to Perform Their Duties Until the End of the State of Emergency

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 8th Broadcast: President Truman announced today that the Anglo-American Joint Chiefs of Staff will continue to perform their duties until the end of the declared state of war emergency.

### Churchill Reiterates the Call for Close Cooperation Between Britain and the United States; The Compassionate Must Also Have Armor and Swords to Ensure the Safety of the Pilgrimage Road

[Reuters, Richmond, Virginia, 7th] Churchill delivered a speech to the Virginia State Legislature today, urging close cooperation between Britain and the United States again, not to disadvantage anyone, nor to seize any interests, but to defend the most valuable principles of our people, not only for our own benefit, but also for future generations, to obtain honor and happiness. Before making this appeal, Churchill asked the audience: Do you know that it is quite dangerous for me to express my opinion? What I am saying, others know it is true in their hearts, but they dare not speak of it publicly. After making these remarks, Churchill said: In the past few years, I have deeply felt that there is a sentence I want to tell you, that is, we must be united. We should move forward courageously on the path to peace. This is our destiny, and it is also the will of God. As for how to achieve this goal, I still cannot tell you. Regarding whether Britain will therefore become a part of the United States, or the United States will re-enter the British Empire, I feel that the path of wisdom lies between these two extremes. We should find a way to cooperate, not only in times of war or difficulty, but also in times of peace. Wars must be prevented in peacetime. If the virtues of victory are not obtained, peace cannot be maintained. Peace cannot be maintained by empty words or diplomacy alone. Peace cannot be maintained by abandoning strength in times of danger. We must have sincere thoughts, a broad vision, and a loyal will. The compassionate must also have armor and swords to ensure the safety of the pilgrimage road. The English-speaking people must work together to fight for common principles. This is my construction and my hope.

The one currently under construction is the 42,500-ton "Vanguard", with eight 15-inch guns, costing about 9 million pounds. After this summer's atomic bomb test, it will be possible to decide the future methods of naval defense and the types of ships. The use of atomic energy may develop to the most dangerous level, but naval defense must not be ignored.

### The Iranian Prime Minister Returns in Vain; Tension in Tehran; The U.S. Announces the Note Presented to the Soviet Union

[Our Newspaper] London, 8th Broadcast: After Britain and the U.S. presented notes to the Soviet Union, they have not received a reply. Recently, the Iranian Prime Minister went to Moscow for negotiations, but also did not achieve results. It is heard that the Iranian side has decided to submit the issue to the Security Council for adjudication.

[United Press, Moscow, 8th] When Iranian Prime Minister departed for Tehran, he said that Soviet-Iranian relations would surely return to normal. However, there was no announcement as to whether any agreement had been reached or what issues had been discussed.

[Reuters, London, 8th] The situation in Tehran became increasingly tense last night. The leftist Tudeh Party and the police have clashed for four consecutive days, and Prime Minister Saed after returning from Moscow, has failed to get all Soviet troops to withdraw from Iran. Yesterday, there was a clash when military police attempted to prevent members of the Tudeh Party and right-wing elements from entering parliament. Three people died and five were injured. The atmosphere in the Iranian capital became increasingly tense after the news of the failure of the Prime Minister's visit to the Soviet Union spread. Soviet pressure on Tehran has not diminished. Soviet troops are still stationed in Khelejd, 25 miles northeast of Tehran, and Chemsar, 50 miles northwest of Tehran.

[United Press, Washington, 7th] The note presented by the U.S. to the Soviet government yesterday was released by the State Department today. The document is over 1,000 words long, stating that the U.S. can no longer remain indifferent to the Soviet Union's decision to keep the Red Army stationed in Iran. The note stated that only withdrawal can promote international credit, which is necessary for maintaining peace between the world's countries and peoples. Please notify the U.S. immediately after deciding on this matter, and it is hoped that the decision made will be in line with the above views.

[United Press, Washington, 8th] The current situation shows that if the Soviet Union does not immediately withdraw its troops from Iran, it will likely be accused again before the United Nations Security Council. The previous accusation was made by Iran itself, accusing the Soviet Union of interfering in its internal affairs. This time, the U.S. may come forward.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 7th] An official communiquÃ© has been issued stating that the Soviet Union and Iran will do everything possible to create a friendly environment to enhance friendly relations between the two countries. Iranian Prime Minister Saed met with Stalin and Molotov several times in Moscow and held talks in a friendly atmosphere to discuss issues related to Iran and the Soviet Union.

### Goering on Trial Asks to Subpoena Two Witnesses

[Reuters, Nuremberg, 8th] Nazi Second-in-Command Goering began his defense today against the Allied judges' charge of conspiring to disrupt world peace. Goering entered the courtroom with a smile, but when the reporter wanted him to raise his arm to take a sworn photo, Goering showed anger, probably because he thought this posture was an insult to the Nazi salute, so he refused to express his anger. During the defense, his lawyer, Stahmer, first requested the court to summon two more witnesses: one was a German Air Force major currently detained in Nuremberg, who was dismissed by Goering for mistreating Allied Air Force personnel, and the other could prove that the assassination of Poles in the Katyn Forest in Russia in 1943 was done by the Soviet Union, not by Germany. In this regard, the court urged him to submit a written request. Stahmer continued, "The defendant's charge of repeatedly destroying the Treaty of Versailles is unreasonable.

### Editorial: Establishing the Framework of a Democratic Political System

Since the successful conclusion of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), many people have expressed concern about the agreements reached by the "PCC," especially those concerning the modification of the political system. China, after a long war of resistance against Japan, urgently needs to recuperate and should no longer experience the calamity of war. This is the unanimous demand of the people of the country. The Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang), which led the entire nation in the war of resistance and achieved victory, also has the long-cherished desire to return power to the people and implement constitutional governance. At the same time, other parties and factions are preparing to participate in actual politics under the recognized leadership of President Chiang Kai-shek as the national leader and with adherence to the Three Principles of the People as the supreme guiding principle for nation-building. To coordinate the opinions of all parties, the Political Consultative Conference was convened. The people of the country placed high expectations on the convening of this historically significant conference, and the results of this conference, on the whole, are indeed quite satisfactory. However, the agreements reached regarding the political system, especially the thorough revision of the "May 5th Draft Constitution," have essentially abandoned the essence of the Five-Power Constitution. The imitation of a bicameral representative system, the establishment of something similar to a responsible cabinet system, and the renewed adoption of so-called party politicsâall of these, if they become reality in the future, will not only violate the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and undermine the framework of the Five-Power Constitution, rendering the efforts of the Kuomintang over the past fifty years futile, but will also cause Chinese politics to revert to a situation even worse and more chaotic than it was in the early years of the Republic. We should respect the agreements reached by the "PCC"âthat is beyond doubt. However, if some agreements lead China's future politics towards chaos, it is necessary to give careful consideration before accepting them and putting them into practice.

This newspaper has commented on the convening of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, stating: "Since the Three Principles of the People are the supreme guiding principle for nation-building in our country and have been accepted by all parties and factions, there should be no question as to how to implement the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution. However, some of the agreements reached at this PCC meeting violate the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, such as those concerning the five-yuan system and the status of provinces. The Five-Power Constitution is a great legacy left to the Chinese people by the Founding Father of the Republic and is a rigorous and precise system designed to remedy the defects of Western parliamentary politics and establish a sound political system for the Three Principles of the People, which should not be misunderstood or distorted. The agreements made at this PCC meeting regarding the draft constitution dismember and undermine the political system that the Three Principles of the People seek to establish. If implemented, they will render the efforts of the Kuomintang over the past fifty years futile... It is hoped that the Central Committee members of the Kuomintang, gathering in Chongqing, will be able to preserve the spirit of the Three Principles of the People while accepting the results of the PCC." Yesterday's Chongqing telegraph stated that the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee held a heated review of the PCC, with the consensus that since all parties and factions adhere to the Three Principles of the People and recognize President Chiang Kai-shek's leadership in nation-building, there should be no distortion of the Three Principles of the People. It was also stated that "the Five-Power Constitution is the teaching of the Founding Father of the Republic and should not be changed rashly; the 'principles for revising the draft constitution' must be corrected." "In view of the shortcomings of the separation of powers system and the abuses of multi-party cabinet systems, our country should adopt a five-yuan system and a presidential system in the future." If the above can be formulated into resolutions and implemented in the future, it will truly meet the earnest expectations of this newspaper and the Chinese people.

Originally, the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution cannot be separated. In a certain sense, the Five-Power Constitution is the core of the Three Principles of the People. The full implementation of the Three Principles of the People must have a political system based on the Three Principles of the People, and this system is the theory of the Five-Power Constitution that the Founding Father of the Republic left to us, expressed in the Five-Power Constitution formulated based on the teachings of the Founding Father of the Republic. Communism has its political system, which is the so-called Soviet political system. The British cabinet system and the American federal presidential system are both products of British and American history. We do not need to import them all wholesale, just as we do not need to import the Soviet political system. Now that all parties and factions adhere to the Three Principles of the People as the supreme guiding principle for nation-building, they should not abandon the framework of the Five-Power Constitution. Abandoning the Five-Power Constitution is abandoning the Three Principles of the People. The "May 5th Draft Constitution" promulgated by the National Government was originally a draft constitution formulated by the Legislative Yuan based on the teachings of the Founding Father of the Republic. Although it has undergone repeated discussions by people inside and outside the Yuan, it seems that there are still unavoidable shortcomings in the areas where considerations were insufficient. However, the system proposed within it is strictly and meticulously structured and forms a legal system in itself. We are preparing to implement constitutional governance, and since everyone adheres to the Three Principles of the People, the future drafting of the great constitution should use this draft as a blueprint for necessary revisions and should not fundamentally reject it and re-draft it. The five-yuan system is where the spirit of the Five-Power Constitution resides and should not be easily despised.

Here, we are reminded of a passage spoken by President Chiang Kai-shek at the memorial week of the Second Plenary Session: "This plenary session concerns the success or failure of our party and the survival of the country. All comrades must be calm and recognize the real environment at home and abroad, study practical methods, and not make indignant and empty arguments based on superficial and fragmented observations... The Political Consultative Conference... is a manifestation of the responsibility of our party to the country and the people. We should promote its implementation for the benefit of the country. However, the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution are the consistent goals of our party's struggle, and the two cannot be separated. Some outsiders believe that as long as the Three Principles of the People are recognized, it is not necessary to adopt the five-yuan system. This point needs to be clarified in detail. The constitution is a major plan for the country's century. All comrades should review it based on the Premier's important teachings. However, since the conference has already made a decision, we can only carefully plan for remedies based on its broad outlines." From this, we can see how concerned President Chiang Kai-shek is about the agreements reached by the PCC in this regard and how he is preventing the Three Principles of the People from changing its nature. Indeed, preventing the Three Principles of the People from changing its nature is not only the business of the Kuomintang alone, but requires the joint efforts of the people of the country. The Kuomintang has a deep historical connection with the Chinese national liberation movement, and the Three Principles of the People is a great legacy left to the Chinese people by the Founding Father of the Republic. All nationals have a responsibility to defend the Three Principles of the People. Establishing the framework of the Five-Power Constitution is the demand of the Chinese people. We do not need to adopt imported political systems. We want to establish our own unique democratic political system.

### British Tram Company Resumes Partial Operation Yesterday; Department Store Labor Dispute Settlement Not Yet Effective; Clash at Wing On Company Results in Bloodshed

[Reported by This Newspaper] A portion of the employees of the British Tram Company went on strike due to the arrest of three union directors, Zhang Xuekui and others. The strike reached its climax the day before yesterday. The Garrison Headquarters explained that these three individuals were arrested because they were reported to be suspected of collaborating with the enemy, and the informant provided sufficient evidence. Therefore, they were arrested and it has nothing to do with the trade union. They have now been sent to the court. If the prosecutor's office finds them innocent after investigation, they will be released. After this explanation, most workers understood the situation and went to work at the company yesterday morning. Some trams also left the factory to operate.

Troops Stationed to Protect Operation

However, a small portion of the employees insisted on continuing the strike and went to intercept the trams that had already left the factory, which caused several minor conflicts among the workers. Therefore, at around 7:30 AM, except for the Hongkou and Huishan districts, all British tram lines were suspended again. After receiving the news, the Municipal Police Bureau, Songhu Garrison Headquarters, and other military and police agencies immediately dispatched a large number of police officers to the head factory on Hart Road to investigate and persuade the workers to resume work. Most workers expressed their acceptance. At around 10:15 AM, two military policemen dispatched by the Garrison Headquarters were stationed on each tram that resumed operation for protection. Yesterday, more than 20 trams on lines 1, 2, and 3, as well as more than 20 trolleybuses on lines 24 and 16, resumed operation.

Employee Representatives Receive Press

[Reported by This Newspaper] Wing On, Sincere, Lane Crawford, China National Goods, Lihua, Zhonghua, The Sun, Lian An, Yushin, Dahu, and other department stores have jointly suspended operations due to labor-management disputes. To report the details and truth of the incident, the employees of the companies held a reception for reporters at 1:30 PM yesterday at No. 334 Nanjing Road, 3rd floor of the Industry Promotion Building. Han Wucheng, a representative of Sincere Company, stated that on February 23rd, the labor side requested improved treatment and proposed a requirement of 116,000 yuan. If the management handled it according to this, there would still be a profit of more than 70 million yuan per month. However, despite repeated mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, it has not been implemented. And since the 7th, they have automatically stopped business. This action is enough to create social unrest, and Section Chief Zhang Zhenyuan of the Social Affairs Bureau also considered it inappropriate and ordered the companies to resume business. The management not only disobeyed its orders but also threatened that if the labor side did not make concessions, the business would be suspended for three months, and the food supply would be stopped. The employee side also stated that they would not yield even for six months. However, the labor representatives, deeply willing to consider the overall situation, decided to consider the Social Affairs Bureau's ruling that the base salary for staff is 60 yuan, the assistant staff is 50 yuan, and the trainees are 45 yuan. However, the management still has no intention of negotiation. However, according to what Section Chief Zhang said to the labor side, he can guarantee a solution within five days, and then continue to persuade the labor side to resume work and the management to resume business.

Conflict Between Both Parties Results in Bloodshed

While the labor-management dispute in the department store has not yet been resolved, a bloodshed incident has occurred in Wing On Company. The reason is that Chen Zuliang, Wang Zhenxin, and Zhu Baogen, the patrol team members dispatched by the employees, were stationed on the passageway leading to the manager's office in the new building of Wing On Company. At 12:15 PM yesterday, Guo Li'an, the general supervisor of the company, ordered them to leave unsuccessfully, so he invited more than 20 senior staff to negotiate with them, which caused a conflict. Chen Zuliang knocked out Guo's teeth, and Wang Zhenxin was injured in the eye. Fortunately, Bai Rong, the company's police, controlled the situation and telegraphed the military and police authorities, and the military police and police came together to maintain order. Because the negotiation with the employee representatives was unsuccessful, Guo Li'an, Chen Zuliang, Wang Zhenxin, Zhu Baogen, etc. were taken to the police station together. Upon hearing the news, the employees were indignant and raised two demands: (1) The company is required to publish an apology to the injured employees in the newspaper; (2) Compensation for medical expenses, and a guarantee that there will be no similar actions in the future.

### "Thank You, Mayor": The Wonderful "Three-Word" Review

[Reported by This Newspaper] In order to comply with the request of the US military, the municipal government has exempted US military personnel from paying food retail donations from now on. US officers and soldiers do not need to pay other taxes in restaurants and dance halls except for food and beverage expenses. Before the municipal government clearly ordered the cancellation of the food tax payment for US military personnel, the US Army Newspaper repeatedly called on the municipal authorities to exempt taxes. Now that it has been fulfilled as desired, the newspaper expressed its gratitude, but the entire text uses only three words, namely: "Thank you, Mayor." The position of the publication is very prominent. The three words are not large, but there is blank space all around them, like news that has been censored. If it is not a regular reader of the newspaper, it may be inexplicable. This style has been common in the United States, but it can be called unique in this city.

### Tide Surge, Water Rushes, Ship Accident: Jiangtai Wheel Collides with Iron Barge; Crane Iron Rod Breaks and Falls Down; Five Sailors and Passengers Injured

The China Merchants Bureau's Jiangtai Wheel sailed to Tianjin on the 14th of last month, and returned to Shanghai from Tianjin yesterday. At about 12:00 noon, it entered the Wusongkou, and at 2:25, it sailed to Zhongzhanpu surface. The US destroyer No. 522 in front slowly drove forward, and when it reached the front of the former Dongyang Company Wharf (that is, outside the Baidu Bridge), the ship turned around and anchored. At this time, it happened to be high tide, and the current was very fast. According to those familiar with navigation, the ship should turn to the left when turning around at high tide, but the ship suddenly turned to the right. The Jiangtai wheel followed it in the rear, advancing without guarding it turning to the right. In order to avoid friction with the ship, the Jiangtai slightly shifted its bow to the right, but the driver's sight was blocked by the ship's hull.

The first buoy on the river, there happened to be a crane iron barge of the Customs Shanhai Engineering Office J.M.G., tied to the buoy for repairs, which will be completed today. The Jiangtai waited for the ship to pass, and the iron barge was close at hand, although

Hard Reverse

But the tide was too fast, it was impossible to avoid, and the bow of the wheel ship rushed into the crane two-pole in the middle, and its power was great, no need to say. The two iron poles are big, about twenty feet high, and broke at once, and fell to the deck of the Jiangtai wheel. The deck was where the anchor machine was, and the crane jib,

All Were Crushed

The right side of the bow, the side iron plate was damaged by about two feet. At that time, two workers working on the bow and three passengers standing on the deck were all crushed. One of the sailors and one of the passengers were seriously injured and unconscious. The ship owner, Liu Xunda, immediately

Horn Sounded For Help

The Customs Port Affairs Department, upon receiving the news, sent the water police to rush there by small wheel. On the one hand, he urgently telegraphed the fire brigade to send an ambulance to the dock to rescue. The injured five people were sent to Shanghai Sanatorium, and the two above were seriously injured and have not been out of danger. The machinery on the iron barge to repair the equipment,

### One Family Turned Traitor, Abusing Power and Doing Evil, Puppet Detectives Poisoned Relatives

Wife Detained, Son Beaten to Death

[Our Newspaper News] Wang Zhiyuan, the current company commander of the 6th Company of the Motor Vehicle Corps of the Third Theater, is from Dongyang County, Zhejiang Province. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, he followed the army to fight in various places. In April 1942, when Dongyang County fell into enemy hands, Wang's distant relative, Wu Xunhao, willingly became a traitor and served as a detective for the puppet Zhejiang Provincial Political Security Bureau. His father, Wu Zhaoqi, held an important position in the bureau, his brother, Wu Cheng, served as a warden, and his brother-in-law, Zhang Xiaoda, served as a team leader. The whole family turned traitor and colluded with each other, relying on the enemy's power and committing all kinds of evil. They led enemy police to detain Wang's wife, Lin Ailian, and Wang's uncle, Wang Nenghai. Wang Nenghai was severely tortured and became disabled. Wang's young child was pushed to the ground by Wu Xunhao and died as a result of illness. Because Wang's Whampoa Military Academy graduation certificate and letter of appointment were found in the house, they demolished the more than twenty rooms on the pretext. After spending a large sum of money, Lin Ailian and Wang Nenghai were released on bail. After the victory, Wang Zhiyuan came to Shanghai with the army and learned that Wu and others were hiding at No. 4 Juqingli, Xinzha Road. He reported to the Xincheng Police Sub-bureau, which ordered detectives to arrest them. However, Wu Zhaoqi and Wu Xunhao, father and son, had fled, and only Wu Cheng and Zhang Xiaoda were arrested and transferred to the High Procuratorate for investigation on suspicion of treason. The case was formally prosecuted. Yesterday morning, Judge Cao Jun of the Criminal Division of the High Court opened a hearing to investigate the case. The two defendants denied having served in puppet positions. Wang Zhiyuan was unable to attend due to official duties, and his company adjutant Yang Bozhou represented him in court, stating that the victims had now come to Shanghai and could attend the next hearing to testify. The court ordered the two criminals to be detained pending further hearing.

### Difficult to Settle US Dollar Exchange, Importers Search for Cash

The US dollar exchange rate fluctuates with the gold market. Recently, importers of various substandard foreign goods must settle in cash in order to fulfill their contracts and make up for their positions, resulting in continuous buying.

### Rice Market Is Chaotic, Authorities Should Pay Attention

Yesterday morning, the rice price was once chaotic. Shopkeepers rushed to buy and sell, and the market was in turmoil. Later, the person in charge of the association persuaded the industry to stabilize the market, so the market became slightly more moderate. As a result, the price rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to yesterday. Flour sales were also smooth, continuing to rise by 600 to 700 yuan.

### Tea Market Transactions Subsided

However, those holding goods are reluctant to easily sell due to the significant costs of their respective goods, resulting in a stable market with prices fluctuating.

### Bank of China Official Explains: Reasons for Higher Forward Exchange Rates

[Our Report] Various sectors have speculated about the forward exchange rates offered by the Central Bank, leading to various misunderstandings. This newspaper's reporter specifically raised several questions to an official from the bank. The official's answers are presented below: (1) The bank's opening of the foreign exchange and gold market this time is based on observing market conditions, with the premise of stabilizing foreign exchange and gold prices. This measure is purely based on the latest theories worldwide and has been adopted by various countries. It is indeed effective in stabilizing currency and gold prices. (2) The bank's offering of forward exchange rates this time is purely to facilitate trade for importers and exporters. For importers, if they order a batch of goods from the United States and expect delivery on April 8th, to avoid the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on their actual import trade profits and losses, they can pay a specified small amount to a designated bank to pre-purchase a certain amount of US dollars due on April 8th, in preparation for timely payment. The bank selling this forward exchange is required to repurchase an equivalent amount of spot exchange as a reserve for the importer to settle the exchange before April 8th. Therefore, the bank selling the forward exchange effectively invests a certain amount of funds in the forward exchange. In the above example, the investment period is one month, so one month's interest should be calculated as compensation for the importer's use of the bank's funds. Based on the bank's current forward exchange rates, the calculated interest is less than 0.5% monthly, while the hidden interest reaches more than 2% monthly. (3) If the bank or other designated banks have foreign exchange settlements, it means that imported goods have been ordered and are awaiting shipment. Judging from the recent frequent increase in foreign exchange settlements, ordered materials will soon be shipped in continuously, which will help stabilize domestic prices to some extent. (4) The bank's announced US dollar exchange rate has not changed, providing the greatest confidence in stabilizing the exchange market. According to an economist's observation, the bank's offering of the April forward exchange rate at 2120 yuan does not mean that the April US dollar exchange rate will be fixed at 2120 yuan. In addition to the interest charged by the bank for one hundred days, it implicitly indicates that the April US dollar exchange rate will not be higher than the current telegraphic transfer rate. Given the small difference between forward and spot exchange rates and the low interest charged, there is a possibility that the April exchange rate may be even lower.

Education and Sports

### Ministry of Education Promotes Electrified Education; Plans to Establish Five Work Teams This Year

[Our Chongqing Report] The Ministry of Education has always attached great importance to electrified education. It has established the China Educational Film Studio, which has produced 48 educational films. At the same time, it is in contact with British and American film news agencies to implement electrified education using films. This year, it plans to establish five electrified education work teams. In the first half of the year, it will first establish two teams: one will remain in the capital to implement electrified education in nearby areas, and the other will be used for teaching in remote areas. Recently, Chairman Chiang also issued a handwritten order to formulate a preliminary five-year electrified education implementation plan and a public education film plan, which the Ministry of Education is currently drafting. It is heard that when electrified education is widely implemented, the Ministry of Education will have its own educational broadcasting station. Whether it is during commemorative weeks, class time, or entertainment time, broadcasts can be made, allowing people to listen to celebrity speeches at any time. Broadcasting will be used as a substitute for public education, and when public education films are implemented, all cinemas will be improved uniformly. Although the jurisdiction of local cinemas will still be in the hands of the Social Affairs Bureau, the guidance rights will belong to the educational administrative organs. In this way, supervisors can also inspect cinemas, checking whether the films they show are in line with public education and whether they violate or are unsuitable for public health, and they can provide guidance and corrections. Electrified education will be promoted in many ways. (An)

Before showing films in the classroom, teachers first describe what the students will see, and then the students ask questions. In this way, films not only help understanding but also guide creative planning and supplementary reading materials, but teachers still hold an important position.

### Youth Returning to School and Finding Employment

Guidance Offices Established in Various Provinces and Cities

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The Ministry of Education previously decided to establish youth returning to school and finding employment guidance offices in various provinces and cities. It is now learned that guidance offices have been established and started working in Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Wuhan, and other places. The candidates for the guidance offices in Hebei, Henan, and Shandong have been announced and are expected to be established in the near future. The offices in Harbin and Chahar are still being organized. In addition, the Ministry of Education has recently established three service stations in Hengyang, Xuzhou, and Shenyang to guide youth in returning to school and finding employment.

### Harbin University Students Have No Schools to Attend

[Central News Agency, Harbin, 7th] During the puppet Manchurian era, Harbin Medical University, Agricultural University, and Industrial University were established here. After the August 15th Restoration, the Industrial University was taken over by the China Changchun Railway and resumed classes. All textbooks have been changed to Russian. Because Chinese students do not understand the language, they have no schools to attend. Although the Agricultural University and Medical University have been maintained by the Harbin Municipal Government with all their strength, they have been severely damaged and cannot resume classes. All students, except for a small number who have gone to Beiping to study, are waiting for tutoring, hoping that the Ministry of Education will organize it as soon as possible.

(1) The main task of central national schools is to guide national schools and promote national education. (2) In addition to establishing elementary school departments, it is also necessary to establish public education departments, with public education divided into two levels, primary and secondary, and taught separately for men and women. (3) Under the principal of the central national school, there should be a director of instruction, and under him, there should be two directors for the elementary school department and the public education department. (4) The principal should be responsible for public relations in the administrative district and raising funds. The director of instruction is responsible for guidance and research work within the district and for organizing district education research associations. As for the establishment period of central national schools, it should start this month.

Funding Issues

Yangjing District and Luxing District have already launched fund-raising activities by local people, and other districts have also formulated fund-raising plans and are actively carrying them out. Therefore, the funding issue should not be difficult. It is also heard that the central national school principals' discussion meeting will be held every two weeks in the future.

### Leake Startled in Liaocheng; Claims It Was Like Exploring a Wilderness

Liaocheng, western Shandong, has been besieged by the Communist army for a long time. The military and civilians inside the city lack coal and food, and the situation is serious. Colonel Leake and his party from the Jinan Executive Headquarters traveled by car from Jinan to the area on the 24th to mediate. They returned to Jinan at 5:00 PM on the 27th after a four-day round trip.

Colonel Leake of the Jinan Executive Headquarters, government representative Tu Xuwu, Communist representative Zheng Rennong, along with Ruan Jianhua, Chief of Staff of the government's 20th Group Army, Huang Yuan, Director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Communist Shandong Military Region, and translator Wang Xi, departed from Jinan in a jeep. Colonel Leake acted as the driver. Although the road was extremely bumpy, he drove directly north due to his skilled driving techniques. In the afternoon, they passed Qihe and traveled northwest for about 60 li to Zhuzhuang, which was already within the Communist army's territory. As the car approached Zhuzhuang, a gunshot suddenly rang out, and bullets flew in the air. A large group of Communist soldiers emerged from the village, surrounding the car. The situation became serious and felt like facing a formidable enemy. Colonel Leake, surprised by the unexpected turn of events, got out of the car and shouted repeatedly, "I am U.S. Military AttachÃ© Colonel Leake." The Communist side, Huang and others, got out of the car and explained vigorously to the surrounding Communist soldiers. They learned that the village was stationed with a regiment of the Communist army's Zhu Jingwu unit, which had mistaken them for the enemy, causing this incident. After half an hour, the car was allowed to pass. Colonel Leake laughed and said, "The road on this trip is so uneven, and the encounters are so unexpected, it's truly no less than exploring a wilderness!" At 5:00 PM, they arrived at Wotang County, where the Communist County Chief Jie Jinsheng led the military and civilians in welcoming them. Leake and his party went to the county government to rest and met with representatives of the people, most of whom carried petitions accusing traitors.

At 9:00 AM on the 26th, Leake met with representatives of the people of Liaocheng. Standing on the car, he addressed the crowd, saying: Whether it is the Chinese Kuomintang or the Communist Party, the government has decided that the Communist army will be reorganized into 20 divisions, and the National army will be 90 divisions, all of which will be national troops. Previously enemies will become good friends later. He hopes that China will no longer divide its own strength and will gather all its strength to build a new, modern nation. The United States is willing to provide China with weapons prepared for the war against Japan (enough to equip) one hundred and eleven divisions, so that every soldier has an automatic rifle and a 105mm howitzer. I have been in the Northeast for a long time and know very well that the Soviet Union should have withdrawn its troops from China's Northeast according to the agreement, because China's peace is the foundation for world peace. Therefore, I have sacrificed my personal material enjoyment in the United States to work for China's peace, etc. In the evening, it was windy and snowy. It only cleared up on the 27th. They left the city at 9:30 AM, braving the cold to return, arriving at 5:00 PM in the afternoon.

â¦Our newspaper's airmail report on the 27th, from He Bingruâ¦

### A Cloud of Dust Leaves Tongguan

â Fan Hong

This Newspaper's Henan Airmail Dispatch, February 20th

It's difficult to reach Chongqing, difficult to live in Chongqing, and even more difficult to leave Chongqing. Fortunately, I, the reporter, received assistance from various parties. After spending more than four months in Chongqing and waiting an indefinite amount of time, I was fortunate enough to get a plane seat to Xi'an, which can only be considered great luck. On the eve of the flight, Mr. Qi Liangyu of the Battlefield Service Corps kindly provided accommodation, sparing me the various difficulties of waiting for the plane at Baishi Station, which made me feel infinitely comforted and warm inside, and also increased my anticipation for the interview trip to North China.

Xi'an Itinerary

On the morning of the 12th, the plane began to take off. The weather that day was perfect, with clear skies and the sun shining obliquely, ideal for low-altitude flight. The heating pipes inside the plane were turned on, making it feel like spring. People showed joyful expressions, quietly waiting for the plane to move forward, accompanied by the sound of the engine. The journey was smooth and fast, reaching Xi'an Airport in two hours, a rare occurrence in previous flights.

After getting off the plane, people felt a great burden lifted. They took a comfortable breath of fresh air, facing the piercing northwest wind and welcoming the warm sunshine in the sky.

Sitting in a car into the city, the dust kicked up by the wheels filled the streets behind the car, mercilessly falling on everyone's heads and bodies. We began to enter Xi'an. Xi'an is an ancient capital, and although barren on the Northwest Plateau, it is still grand enough. The tall and wide city walls, the broad streets, the ancient old trees, and the honest and simple folk customs all give you a completely different new impression. To put it bluntly, Xi'an is a bit too backward compared to other major cities in the country.

Here, women wear cheongsams that cover their feet, and men don't wear suits and leather shoes. Lipstick and high heels are almost extinct. Barber shops and movie theaters are extremely "careless." Shoe stores and department stores have incomplete goods and are not flashy. There are no dance halls at all. If a woman with a perm and high heels appears, it will attract the attention of many people, and some backward women will even chase them to see them up close.

There aren't many big restaurants in Xi'an, and even fewer serving Jiangzhe, Cantonese, Hunan, Beijing, or Shanghai cuisine. There are also many brothels, which is said to be due to the lack of hotels and the large number of travelers. In fact, there are not few hotels, with statistics showing over a hundred, and the large number of travelers is indeed a fact, but the abundance of idle money and the lack of entertainment are also major reasons for the increase in prostitutes.

There are several newspapers in Xi'an, including the Xijing Daily, Zheng Bao, Qingnian Daily, Northwest Cultural Daily, Yishi Bao, Qinfeng Industrial and Commercial Joint Edition, Xijing Ping Bao, North China News, and Xinqin Evening News. Zheng Bao has the widest circulation. Apart from the "Plateau Monthly," there are no other magazines to be seen. The cultural circles in Xi'an are extremely depressed, cultural work has no development, news personnel have no security, and news work is really difficult to develop.

The general price level is lower than that of Chongqing, by about one-fifth to one-third, but the quality and quantity are too poor. So, rather than saying that prices are cheap in Xi'an, it's better to say that the standard of living is low. Xi'an retains the style of an ancient capital, but it is not a luxurious and extravagant city. One cannot hear decadent music. What one hears instead is suppressed, unfree cries of suffering and injustice.

Perhaps Xi'an is too large, lacking people, houses, and institutions, and political achievements are not yet very significant. However, the authorities have a determination to work hard and have far-sighted vision and plans for everything. In the future, Xi'an, and even Shaanxi, may become progressive regions.

The reporter stayed in Xi'an for a week and continued on his journey after the Lantern Festival.

Reconnaissance of the Longhai Railway

After a week in Xi'an, I boarded a Longhai Railway train heading east. The Longhai Railway is the only railway remaining in the country during the war. It has shouldered the great responsibility of the War of Resistance and continued the hardship of recovery, contributing greatly to China. Currently, the western end of the Longhai Line can reach Tianshui, and the eastern end can reach Shanzhou (tickets are only sold to Tongguan). The section from Shanzhou to Luoyang is being rushed to repair and is expected to be completed by the end of May. Luoyang to Zhengzhou can be reached directly. There are two routes from Zhengzhou to Kaifeng: one is to take a light train, follow the old Yellow River railway bridge to Xinxiang, and transfer east; the other is to pass through Zhongmou over the Yellow River and take a train east. The former takes two days, and the latter takes one day. East of Kaifeng is connected to Xuzhou. East of Xuzhou, after being destroyed by the Communist army on the 14th of last month, the road to Lianyungang has been cut off to this day. This is something that the people going to North China deeply resent.

There are three trains from Xi'an to Tongguan every day. The third-class fare to Tongguan is 690 yuan, second-class is doubled, and first-class is doubled again. Few passengers get off along the way; those going to Tongguan account for 90% of the total. Some passengers can't buy tickets and have to buy them on board. People have endured eight years of hard life during the War of Resistance, and they are no longer allowed to choose when taking the train. It's enough to put their bodies on and not walk, and it's enough to put their luggage on and not carry it. What's the point of talking about sitting, lying down, or being comfortable? Everything on the train is already inferior to the past, and with the overcrowding of passengers, there is no enjoyment at all, only the discomfort of polluted air, restricted movement, and no place to sit or lie down. For passengers heading east, Xi'an and Baoji both have joint transportation offices to handle joint transportation registration, with twenty people at each office, which can save the trouble of waiting for the train in Tongguan. Those who register, in addition to having military or public personnel certificates, those with personal connections are faster. However, abuses and unfairness are gone, and it is much more advanced and fair than airplane registration.

The reporter arrived in Tongguan at 11:30 AM and stayed at the military station until dawn before leaving the station, which is also a convenience for passengers.

Tongguan in Perspective

Tongguan faces the river and backs the mountain, bearing the brunt of the Fenglingdu Pass, which is a natural barrier known to all Chinese people. During the war, it resisted the enemy's invasion, but Tongguan was the one that took the most artillery shells. The city is full of ruined walls and broken buildings, with no human habitation, only weeds and horses, fully showing the deep pain of the wounds it suffered during the war. It almost sacrificed its entire life for the country.

The area near the station in Tongguan West Pass is a newly emerging street. In the past, when trains traveled between Shaanxi and Henan, it was once prosperous. When the railway opened, Luoyang and Xi'an took its place. Now, it has once again become a necessary stop for travelers between Shaanxi and Henan, so everything is set up for travelers.

What you can't imagine is that the streets are very new, and eight or nine out of ten hotels have just been built. The rooms are small and short, and the prices are 400, 500, or 800 yuan per room. Each quilt costs 150 yuan, which is quite expensive. Food is also more expensive than in Xi'an, with a plate of food costing no less than 300 yuan. Poor people mostly live on porridge and steamed buns. The small street, less than half a mile long, has many patterns and is comparable to a city.

Behind the vegetable market, there are also many entertainments, like Chongqing's Jiaochangkou. There are street performers, medicine sellers, fortune tellers, opera singers, and storytellers, a variety of things to amuse idlers. Beyond that area is the river beach, where you can go to the Yellow River to admire the rushing waves and the turbulent flow of the Yellow River day and night, and look at Fenglingdu Pass, which has been occupied by the enemy for many years. The beautiful rivers and mountains urgently need to be restored, which fills people with indignation. The joint transportation office stands behind the train station. The allocation of train seats is 50% for military personnel, 30% for public and educational personnel, and 20% for civilians. The fare to Luoyang is 6,530 yuan and only long-distance tickets to Luoyang are sold (a total of 261 kilometers, calculated at 25 yuan per kilometer). Seven trains depart daily, two for the Longhai Railway and two for the joint transportation office, all of which are trucks, with only a few simple sheds and no seats.

About 6,000 passengers arrive in Tongguan every day, with three trains. Except for 10% who cross the river to Shanxi via Fenglingdu, at least 5,000 people want to go east. Large horse-drawn carts, drawn by three or four horses, are called "Jialala" cars. Each cart carries more than 2,000 catties and runs about thirty a day. It takes five or six days to reach Luoyang, but it can carry more luggage and avoid the anxious long wait in Tongguan with its high cost of living. Rubber-wheeled carts pulled by people are called "Jiazi" carts, mostly for short trips, with uncertain prices. Many people also walk. About twenty or thirty boats cross the river north from Tongguan every day, mostly taking small roads to Taiyuan. The fastest takes eight days to reach Taiyuan.

There are sales points for the Shen Bao and other newspapers in Tongguan, as well as resident reporters from various Xi'an newspapers. The county-level work is extremely dull. The working hours are from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM every day, and it's all routine official business. New policies and construction sites are also nowhere to be seen. The Shanxi-Chahar-Suiyuan Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is also in the city and is preparing to start work (February 20th).

American Military to Conduct Atomic Bomb Tests

### Atomic Bombing of Warships: Three Experiments to Be Conducted

In May and July 1946, the American military will conduct two experiments of atomic bomb bombing warships on Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands in the Central Pacific. These two experiments will determine the future of naval combat power. A single atomic bomb will destroy one hundred naval targets. Among them, thirty-five are Japanese, German, and other foreign ships, ranging from submarines to aircraft carriers and battleships. Up to 20,000 people will participate in the experiments.

The United States Joint Chiefs of Staff has selected Vice Admiral Blandy as the commander of the First Joint Special Task Force. In the first experiment, a B-29 Superfortress will take off from Kwajalein Atoll and drop an atomic bomb a few hundred feet from the target. Eniwetok and other coral islands within a radius of 200 miles will be evacuated first. The second atomic bomb is scheduled to be dropped on July 1st, targeting several warships. The third deep-water experiment may be held in 1947.

(Top) The USS Pennsylvania, the flagship of the United States, will also be one of the bombing targets.

(Middle) The USS New York will be one of the atomic bomb test targets to be held in May and July of this year. Other targets include the USS Arkansas, the USS Nevada, the aircraft carriers USS Saratoga and USS Independence, sixteen destroyers, eight submarines, the German heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen, the Japanese battleship Nagato, and the light cruiser Sakawa.

(Bottom) Another bombing target is the Japanese battleship Nagato (American translation).

### Old Friends Reunite at Sea: Air Force Captain Mao Shangzhen Intensifies Training for Shanghai Air Mobilization

Shanghai Jiangwan Airport is the main base for the Sino-American Air Force in Shanghai. Airplanes take off and land every day, as frequently as eagles take off and land near cliffs in the wilderness. Marshall, Patterson, and Wedemeyer have all landed and taken off here. Jiangwan Airport always has a constant flow of people and vehicles, becoming a focal point of attention for the people of Shanghai.

In the military camp area within a two-kilometer radius, the Shanghai-based unit of the 1st Squadron, 1st Group of the Chinese Air Force, has Captain Mao Shangzhen of the 2nd Flight as its leader, sitting at his desk, solving the constant stream of problems from morning to night.

Twenty-Two Missions

Captain Mao Shangzhen is tall and thin, with big eyes, and doesn't look at people much, even when he smiles, his eyelids droop. After graduating from aviation school, he immediately fought in the unit, piloting Soviet Ilyushin Il-4 and B-25 aircraft. Based in Liangshan, Sichuan, his 2nd Flight bombed Japanese military targets along the Pinghan Railway line between Wuhan, Zhengzhou and Xinxiang throughout the year. He personally led the aircraft on twenty-two missions. The most difficult one was the bombing of the Yellow River Railway Bridge in Zhengzhou on April 12th last year. The enemy had deployed dense anti-aircraft artillery positions on the railway bridge. Two holes were blown in the bridge, and the bridge piers collapsed, but all their aircraft were riddled with bullets like a hornet's nest. One B-25 never returned.

Elite Bomber Squadron

The 1st Squadron of the Air Force was originally an elite bomber unit in the Chinese Air Force. The current Squadron Leader, Major Wu Kunchen, is a veteran who has taken off to bomb enemy positions more than thirty times in a year. In army combat, officers at the regimental level rarely have the opportunity to fight directly, mostly serving in the front-line fortifications or taking command during the advance. But the Air Force is different. The higher the position, the more they have to brave bullets and danger, flying in the lead to lead the entire unit forward to fight. Xu Huansheng, the commander of the 1st Wing, is a famous combat leader who personally braves bullets and various dangers.

Air Crew Trainees

Currently, the 1st Squadron is converting some combatants to fly air transport aircraft. The first American air transport aircraft to come to China were C-47s, with a transport capacity of 4,500 pounds per aircraft. During the early stages of China's blockade, C-47 aircraft transported essential military supplies to China. Later, the demand for air transport increased, and C-47s became outdated (but they are still the best aircraft for passenger transport, seating thirty passengers, larger than the fourteen-seat transport aircraft before the war). A type of air transport aircraft called C-46 became more common. These aircraft can carry 8,500 pounds of supplies and are also twin-engine. The Shanghai-based unit of the 1st Squadron in Jiangwan is responsible for the C-46 air transport aircraft training, under the direction of Captain Mao Shangzhen.

Training Implementation Method

These aircrew trainees in Shanghai are all veterans of the 1st Squadron. The first five groups are trained by the American Air Force, starting with aircraft instruction, then aircraft performance flights (experiencing and understanding the performance of the aircraft in flight), followed by normal takeoffs and landings, single-engine takeoffs and landings (in case one of the two engines fails, you can still take off or land with one engine), instrument flying, and crosswind takeoffs and landings (in case you can't find a designated airport, you can also take off and land at a small airport), and finally loaded takeoffs and landings, culminating in a long-distance loaded flight. The entire training time is twenty hours, and a bomber pilot is transformed into an air transport aircraft pilot.

The Air Transport Security Team goes to the Northeast, sends investigation teams to inspect the front lines and railways, and delivers supplies to small villages where transportation is disrupted. All of this can be done very thoroughly.

Happy Reunion with Old Friends

Captain Mao Shangzhen has completed the training of several groups in Shanghai in three months. Fighting seems to have faded away like a dream, a shadow of smoke. Back in Liangshan in those mountains, when I followed the B-23 to bomb the Pinghan Railway bridge, Captain Mao taught me how to use parachutes and dangerous response techniques. All of that is in the past. Now, in Shanghai, where cars flow like water and horses like dragons, in Shanghai, where food, clothing, housing, and transportation are completely modernized, we old friends reunite, drink a cup of coffee brewed on an electric stove, watch the red glow of firewood burning in the stove, and it feels like another world.

Single Old Youth

From combat to air transport, the heavy burden on the Air Force has not changed from the war era to the peace era. Mao Shangzhen has been out of aviation school for eight years, enduring the hardships of war for eight years. He has turned himself into a thirty-two-year-old single old youth. Time has passed, and he only has a few colorful pieces of copper and iron in his small luggage. Those are a Huaguang Medal (designated for the Battle of the Yellow River Bridge), a first-class and second-class Propaganda Medal each, and a third-class Air Force Restoration Medal. According to what he told the reporter, he likes to eat good cigarettes, loves to drink coffee, loves to keep warm by the fire in winter, and loves to gather and chat with a group of young men with the same fate. He gets up at 6:00 AM every morning, and after his chatting comrades disperse at 9:00 PM, he handles team affairs alone until he goes to bed at 12:00 AM. I heard that the captain is getting married soon. He pointed to a photo and said, "I like her very much!" (Zhu Minwei.)

### On "So Be It"

â Xiaoshan

In old Chinese dramas, there is a very common and very important 'line,' which is 'So be it.'

The problem is not the original meaning of the two words 'So be it,' but the 'transcendent nature' of 'So be it.' After the actor says 'So be it,' the plot often changes suddenly, with new developments and new performances.

For example, when Saierdun gets back his double copper coins, he still wants to settle old scores with Huang Daquan. After Zhu Guangzu explains it frankly, he suddenly has a great epiphany, and with a decisive and clear 'So... be it!' he blurts out 'Let's write off the feud between our families!' They shake hands and make peace, and Leping regains its glory.

For example, when Mo sees that his master is about to die, he can't help but burst into tears, and with a desperate 'So... be it!' he decides to die to repay his master! The plot then takes a major turn.

The production of 'So be it' is very laborious. At this point in the drama, the actor is seen staring, clenching his fists, raising his voice, 'So' is blurted out, long and forceful, with the tail dragged into a 'flying tone,' then closing his lips, stamping his foot, nodding his head, and forcing out a short and heavy 'be it,' while the 'scene' strikes a beat, and the big gong 'clangs,' making the air so tense that you can't breathe. The actor's 'doing' reaches this point, the audience's emotions gather at this point, and the climax of the plot also ends here.

Therefore, 'So be it' is a turning point, a representation, and a 'determination' in the actor's mouth. When the mountains and rivers are exhausted and you suspect there is no road, once 'So be it' is said, it turns into 'a new village appears with bright flowers and dark willows!'

Many audience members with knowledge of drama know how to predict the arrival of 'So be it.' This play, this situation, this time, this place, 'So be it' should be said, they observe very clearly.

What's terrible is: everyone is stretching their necks, waiting for the stage to come up with a 'So be it,' a new expression, a new determination, a new style, a new facility, but the actor is still slowly dancing his 'water sleeves,' singing 'Return of the Dragon,' in the same old tune, how can the audience not be disappointed?

Therefore, the graceful 'So be it' is also distorted and understood differently: 'Forget it!'

The audience shouts a full house: 'Better not sing!'

Life can be said to be the master of all things, it is so important, then how many living worlds are there in this universe? From ancient legends and myths, it can be known that people in the past thought there were many places where life existed, but these are just legends and myths.

Modern astronomical physics tells us that space is so large, there are so many stars, but the living world is pitifully small.

The surface temperature of the celestial bodies we see is between 1,600 and 30,000 degrees. At such high temperatures, molecules cannot exist. In this extremely turbulent atomic circle, no one believes that life exists! What's more, the temperature outside the enclosed mass is 460 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. It is simply impossible for life to exist. But astronomers tell us that this is how it is everywhere in the universe except for the solar system; the physical conditions required for lifeâa suitable temperature such as a liquid environmentâare only one in ten thousand trillion in the universe.

In the solar system, the surface of the sun reaches 6,000 degrees, and the existence of life is almost impossible. Among the nine planets surrounding it, except for the Earth, which has life, Neptune and Pluto are too far from the sun and have become frozen hard blocks; Mercury is too close to the sun and has become a boiling mass, and there is no hope of life. The temperatures on Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus are all between 150 and 170 degrees below zero. There is a lack of internal heat, and relying solely on sunlight is not enough to sustain life; also, there is no water such as oceans, and the ground is covered with ice and snow, so life cannot exist.

Although the temperature on Venus is closer to the temperature on Earth, the daytime is extremely hot, and the nighttime suddenly drops to 75 degrees below zero. Even if there is life, it would be difficult to adapt!

As for Mars, it was once thought to be similar to Earth, with a rotation period similar to Earth's (only a few minutes difference), and the temperature at the poles is between 90 and 120 degrees below zero, and the red passageway temperature is about 40 degrees. It was observed that there were intersecting canals and climate changes, and it was most likely to have life. However, it is disappointing when viewed through a 100-inch telescope. What were previously thought to be climate changes and intersecting canals can be said to be formed by wild changes in deserts and the like. Therefore, at least conscious life lacks evidence of existence, but if it is necessary to speculate that there is life elsewhere, Mars is more likely.

The precious flower of life blooms in this Earth suitable for life with a very accidental opportunity, and conscious human beings measure and study this universe, striving to uncover the mysteries of all physics and the universe, which is very meaningful.

Since life is so rare in the universe, how can humans not seek mutual benefit and move forward hand in hand?

There is a small food stall in Nanchang called "Heaven Knows." I recently heard that a bicycle shop is being planned and will be named "Earth Knows."

Various Thoughts

### Are Chinese People Really Incapable?

â He Enguang

The phrase "Chinese people are really incapable" has recently become strangely popular in society. Readers have probably heard it. To put it bluntly, perhaps you've even said it yourself? Today, let's try to objectively evaluate the appropriateness and meaning of this phrase. In my personal analysis, the psychology of those who say this largely stems from witnessing many unfair facts, corrupt morals, or inappropriate government measures in society, leaving them feeling helpless and sighing in resignation. However, it also inevitably contains two kinds of psychology: one is that Chinese people are really incapable, but everyone else, like me, must be able to do well, and I am the most hopeful person in China; the other is to express that China has been disappointed and cannot be improved no matter what, and even my personal efforts are in vain. In short, no matter what meaning it contains, it is always a negative statement and will never have positive significance. Strangely, although it is so popular, I have never heard the chairman say it, or other worthy people in society say it. I think that even if Chinese people are not good now, it should never be said: "Chinese people are really incapable." Because if they are not good, do you want them to remain bad forever? Don't you want to find a way to make them better? Furthermore, we keep saying that Chinese people are really incapable. Are we also Chinese? Have we done well ourselves? True, perhaps Chinese people are not capable, but why are Chinese people not capable? Have we done any research on this? Therefore, instead of saying that Chinese people are really incapable, it is better to say: "Why are Chinese people incapable?" That would be more appropriate. Otherwise, if everyone always shouts "Chinese people are really incapable" in a negative way, China may really not improve. However, at the very least, we all hope that China will improve.

### Good Early Spring Morning Light

â Su Yin

The brilliance of the morning sun shines on the morning sky, and in the silent air, one or two crowings of chickens and the subtle chirping of birds can be heard. Ah, what a clear and tranquil early spring morning this is! Although the air is still quite chilly, this is a unique characteristic of early spring â clear and solemn. In such a beautiful morning light, we are taking our children outdoors to welcome the arrival of early spring, letting the clear morning breeze wash away the turbidity of the night, and letting our languid souls be revitalized by the vigor of the morning.

However, many lazybones who are not blessed to enjoy this are still lying in bed, ignoring their young children's calls to get up. The windows are tightly closed, and the curtains are heavily drawn, for fear that the fresh air and radiant sunlight might seep in. They breathe in the foul air of the bedding and curtains, confined in the small room that still retains the image of the previous night, forming a clear boundary with the outside world: outside is the morning light of early spring, bright and full of vitality; inside is the gloom of the night, gray and lifeless! The people inside do not realize that this is the beginning of another day, and dreams still entangle their hearts; they are still figures from the previous night.

Poor lazybones, you are too foolish! Do you think "lying in bed until sunrise" is happiness? But the bright sun is sighing. He bestows his precious sunlight and the vitality of spring upon you, hoping that you will receive his kindness, like all other insects, flowers, and trees on the earth, making you full of vitality and vigor. But you are so foolish, writhing in bed like a hibernating lazy snake.

Only the farmers are the happiest. They get up in the hazy dawn to welcome the arrival of light, they bathe in the morning light, breathe in the fresh air, cultivate and harvest, bringing golden grain to the world. Work, sunshine, and air make them healthy and happy.

### Do You Want to Live?

â WeibÅ

Recorded from "The Guards of the Rhine"

If we fight for the happiness of mankind, then we must stand among the most advanced people.

Anger is a kind of resistance, you must guide it onto the right path, harness it, and benefit others.

At this time, we must clarify our position and what we should do. It is a waste to sit in the living room and discuss one's beliefs as if chatting.

As long as someone lives without freedom, then we are all guilty.

I don't want to wait, time waits for no one. For me, waiting is always the worst thing.

You cannot put dignity on a person, but if a person wants to gain dignity, then he must fight for it.

Those who want to live have the best chance to live.

â Lillian Hellman, original author

### Social ServicesãAnswers to Readers

Zhang Zuxiang from Anhua County asks: (1) Is "air injection" the latest treatment method? What is the method of injection? Is it injected regularly or daily? Do ordinary hospitals have this treatment equipment? (2) My current condition is that my chest sometimes feels slightly painful and there is an unnatural sensation. My throat constantly secretes a mucus-like substance with a salty taste. I don't cough, and my appetite is good. In addition to "air injection," are there any other medicines that are easy to mail? Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers: (1) Air injection is a type of atrophy treatment for lung disease. The method of implementation is to inject air into the pleural space to compress the affected part of the lung, stopping the erosive effect early. It is injected once a week or every few days and continues for one to two years to see results. However, whether this method can be used must be determined by X-ray or fluoroscopy. (2) The main treatments for lung disease still involve rest, air, sunlight, and nutrition. There are no special drugs for sale on the market. Chen Shunshun from Baiguan, Zhejiang Province, asks: My wife is in her twenties and has been suffering from stomach pain since March of last year. Many Chinese medicine doctors have seen her and said they can't do anything. Now her lower abdomen is very large, and there is a hard lump starting from the middle of her abdomen, which is extremely painful. At this moment, her lower back is also swollen, and sometimes her chest is very painful and she cannot breathe. Her appetite is still good, her hands, feet, and face are not swollen, she has not had her period for eight months, her urination is short, and she cannot sleep peacefully at night. Please ask a famous doctor to indicate an effective pill formula for her to purchase and take.

Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers: I don't know if your wife is pregnant. Otherwise, it may be an ovarian cyst that needs to be surgically removed. It is best to have a gynecological examination by a doctor to clarify the situation.
