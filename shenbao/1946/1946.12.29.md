[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The National General Budget Proposal for the 36th year was originally scheduled to be submitted for discussion at the Supreme National Defense Council on the 28th.

At the same time, it should be sent to the provincial and municipal councils for review, and any opinions should also be sent to the Executive Yuan. (3) After receiving the general budget proposal mentioned above, the Executive Yuan should immediately convene the relevant departments to review it and submit it to the Executive Yuan meeting for approval. Then, it should be sent by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics to the central government for approval. The budget should be approved by the highest budget authority. After the provincial and municipal budgets are approved, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics should consolidate them and forward them to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation, and simultaneously notify the Executive Yuan. (4) After the Legislative Yuan decides on the general budget mentioned above, it should be submitted to the National Government for promulgation and implementation, and at the same time, it should be sent to the Executive Yuan for distribution to the provincial and municipal governments for execution.

### Supreme National Defense Council Holds Regular Meeting; Approves New Standards for Adjusting Civil Servant Salaries; Decides on Transitional Measures for Unifying the Northeast Monetary System

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The 212th regular meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council was held at 9 AM on the 28th, chaired by Ju Zheng, with more than 30 attendees, including Song Ziwen and Shao Lizi. The following important cases were passed: (1) The proposal for the standard for the payment of living subsidies for central civil servants and teachers was approved (according to the approved standard sent by the Executive Yuan, such as the amounts reported on the 28th). It will be implemented from December, and the adjusted and increased funds will be disbursed by the Ministry of Finance first, and the additional funds will be handled at the end of the year.

The Ministry of Interior believes that this is not entirely consistent with the original legislative intent and the resolution is as follows: through legislative procedures, the following sentence is added after the second paragraph of the original Article 2 and Article 3, "The restrictions in the preceding Article 1 do not apply to principals of schools at all levels: 'and may concurrently serve after being elected.'" (4) The proposal by Committee Member Zhu Qiqing to have the two specialized committees on finance and economy review the transitional measures for unifying the Northeast monetary system was decided to have two measures: 1.

When submitting to the treasury after the general account of each fee is closed, a separate report should be submitted to the Ministry of Finance and the Finance Bureau of that province or municipality for verification. (4) If an agency issues a treasury warrant from its ordinary fund deposit to transfer funds from place A to place B, and it is still deposited and used in the National Treasury, the remaining expenses should be returned to the total revenue of the 36th year before the end of April of the 36th year, and the agency and the National Treasury should separately report to the Ministry of Finance and the National Treasury Headquarters for verification. (5) The special fund deposits, except for construction funds and other funds, are handled in accordance with the ordinary fund deposit in accordance with Articles 2, 3, and 4. The unused funds at the end of the 35th year shall be transferred to the 36th year for use. (6) The funds allocated by the Ministry of Finance in accordance with emergency orders should be supplemented by the relevant department in the form of a budget estimate and submitted for approval before the end of January of the 36th year. If the circumstances are special and it is impossible to supplement the estimates within the time limit, the Executive Yuan may prepare the estimates on its behalf and submit them for approval. The deadline for submitting the aforementioned supplementary estimates to the Supreme National Defense Council for approval is the end of February of the 36th year. If the approval is given after that date, it will be used as the expenditure for the 36th year, and the National Treasury should make the necessary corrections and transfers before April 15 of the 36th year. (7) The accounting reports of each branch treasury for the funds received and paid in the total revenue deposit of the general treasury before the end of February of the 36th year should be submitted to the general treasury before the end of March of the 36th year, and the general treasury should complete the process before the end of April. (8) The funds that should have been received in the 35th year but have not been paid shall be processed as revenue for the 35th year if they are paid before the end of February of the 36th year, and as revenue for the 36th year if they are paid after the deadline. (9) These measures shall be implemented after being approved by the Supreme National Defense Council.

### The Beiping Municipal Government Protests the Case of a U.S. Soldier Raping a Girl; The U.S. Military Authorities Express Complete Acceptance

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 28th] The Beiping Municipal Government has lodged a serious protest with the U.S. military authorities regarding the case of a U.S. soldier insulting a girl. The content includes (1) apology, (2) punishing the perpetrators, (3) compensation, and (4) a guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again. The U.S. military has expressed complete acceptance.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 28th] After a part of the newspapers published the case of a Chinese girl being raped by a U.S. soldier, Chinese university students here are planning to hold a demonstration on Monday. The U.S. military authorities in Beiping are very concerned about this. According to a statement issued tonight, the two U.S. soldiers who committed the crime have been detained. The U.S. military authorities are working closely with the Beiping police to investigate the truth. The police and the U.S. military authorities will not release details of the case until the full investigation is completed. However, according to well-informed sources, the raped girl claimed that she was taken to a polo field in the commercial district of the city by two drunk U.S. soldiers, and one of the U.S. soldiers raped her three times. It is also said that the U.S. soldiers kept her in the polo field for a total of three hours. During this time, she tried to attract the attention of passers-by, but it was ineffective. Later, a police officer saw them and took the U.S. soldiers to the police station. According to Tian Wu, the two U.S. soldiers accused of rape said that they met the girl on the street and she greeted them, saying that she would go to a hotel with them if they gave her five U.S. dollars.

However, according to U.S. Army and Navy personnel, if a demonstration is held, this order will be issued.

### Report on Fu Zuoyi's Discussion of Military and Political Affairs in Chahar Province; Commander's Office of the 12th War Area to Move to Zhangjiakou Next Month; Efforts to Eliminate Water Damage in Suiyuan's Western Region and Houtao Area

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 28th] It is reported that Commander Fu Zuoyi came to Beiping to confer with the 11th War Area on joint defense matters. On the afternoon of the 28th, he flew back to Zhangjiakou. It is reported that Mr. Fu met with reporters before his departure and answered the broad range of questions raised by the reporters one by one.

(1) Military Affairs: Mr. Fu first addressed the rumors of a so-called joint defense conference among Taiyuan and the northwestern provinces, saying, "There was no such meeting at all." He also stated, "How can Deng Baoshan leave Yulin?" He continued, stating that all sixteen county towns in Chahar Province are in the hands of the National Army and that the communist forces in the hinterland of Chahar Province are very scattered. However, the communist forces still have some strength in the border areas of the province. In the grasslands north of Chahar, only two regiments under Yun Ze's command are active. In Zuoyun and Youyu near Datong, there are about ten thousand communist troops. Currently, the area between Datong and Zhangjiakou can still be secured. The area between Datong and Taiyuan belongs to the 12th War Area, and there is no plan to open it up. The Duolun area is currently defended by the 12th Army and is temporarily under the Northeast Headquarters. Yulin is within the boundaries of the 12th War Area, and supplies are still the responsibility of the 12th War Area, while command is temporarily under the Northwest Headquarters. The Commander's Office of the 12th War Area will officially move to Zhangjiakou in January next year. A command post will be established in the Guihua area, with Chairman Dong in charge. The 12th War Area will also be divided into pacification zones to promote pacification work separately. However, the candidates for dividing the zones have not yet been decided. At present, the government still hopes to resolve political issues through peaceful means, so the speculation of the outside world regarding the actions of the National Army is mostly inaccurate because the current situation cannot be viewed from a purely military perspective.

(2) Political Affairs: Mr. Fu stated that the newly announced candidates for the Chahar and Suiyuan provincial governments have not yet taken office because many of them are attending the National Assembly in Nanjing and have not returned. The policy guidelines for Chahar Province will also be discussed after the new provincial committee members arrive. Currently, there are no major difficulties in promoting political work in Chahar Province because the land issue in Chahar Province is not yet a problem. In the past, the Communist Party only carried out liquidation struggles on material goods, food, and money in Chahar Province and did not redistribute land. Those who lost land had sold it themselves, so today's handling is easier. The current provincial government has sent personnel to conduct a thorough investigation of the land situation. This year, Chahar's land tax and military service are exempt. The various measures formulated by the Pacification Zone Political Affairs Committee are generally applicable to Chahar Province, and those that are not suitable can be flexibly adapted. At present, the people urgently need stability, and the Chahar Provincial Government is working hard to achieve this. As for financial matters, Chahar Province's current income is equal to zero. The source of funds for the province next year, the land tax, will not be levied until after October, so the situation can be described as extremely difficult. Both Chahar and Suiyuan provinces have not prohibited the export of grain, but because the government is purchasing large quantities of military grain locally, most of the people's surplus grain is sold locally, so the amount exported is not large.

(3) Construction: Mr. Fu stated that the Longyan Iron Mine has stopped iron smelting because it only has a small iron smelting furnace with a capacity of 20 tons. Instead, it is focusing on producing iron ore. The personnel budget for the Xiahuayuan Power Plant has been finalized, and repairs began on the 20th. Currently, the boilers are in good condition, and only the switchboard needs to be replaced. It is expected to be repaired in three months, generating 10,000 kilowatts. These two major industrial sectors have been taken over by the Resources Commission for operation. In addition, the 58 factories in Zhangjiakou that were destroyed by the Communist Party have been taken over by the provincial government. Currently, personnel are being sent to various counties and townships to inquire about the scattered machinery and equipment, collect them, and organize them. These factories can be restored to operation once the Xiahuayuan Power Plant resumes power generation. However, most of these 58 factories were privately operated by the Japanese during the enemy and puppet regime era. They were small in scale and were cultivated in the hothouse of the Mengjiang government behind the closed gate of Nankou. In the future, after they are restored, it is feared that some factories will not be able to compete with the large-scale industries in the coastal and inland areas. After the factories closed down, the provincial government continued to provide relief to the unemployed workers. Some have been introduced to the Ping-Sui Railway Bureau to break stones, and those who are widowed, orphaned, or lonely are provided with food and lodging at no cost.

(4) Western Suiyuan: Western Suiyuan and the Houtao area were Mr. Fu's base of resistance during the war. He said with deep feeling: The people of this corner of Western Suiyuan made great contributions to the war of resistance. After the victory, when the National Army moved east, no one helped the people prevent floods, resulting in the great water damage. In the future, I will do my best to eliminate water damage and develop water conservancy in the Houtao area, converting all the canal mouths into modern steel-reinforced concrete structures. The central government has agreed to issue funds, and the Executive Headquarters has agreed to allocate flour to assist. In addition, I will try to establish good hospitals and schools in Shanba and establish an electric light company. Because of the inconvenient transportation in the Houtao area, fish, rice, meat, and vegetables are very cheap, perhaps the cheapest in the country. If the Baotou-Ningxia Railway is extended to the Houtao area, this fertile land could accommodate millions of people without any problem. When asked by reporters whether he would bring the spirit of Shanba, which had been built with years of hard work, unchanged to Zhangjiakou, Mr. Fu replied: Customs and material conditions are related. In the past, being confined to Western Suiyuan, we had no choice but to live in such hardship.

(5) Inner Mongolia: When asked by reporters about the Mongolian people's proposal to establish a unified Mongolian political organization and what Commander Fu's opinion was on this matter, Mr. Fu stated: I have not yet had an appropriate time to express my opinion on this issue. However, I believe that to solve the Inner Mongolia problem, it is necessary to understand that the Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan areas are currently areas where Mongolians and Han Chinese live together. It is necessary to take into account both Mongolian and Han interests, so that their benefits are mutual and complementary. If all parties can organize an inspection group to conduct on-site investigations in the three provinces, it will be beneficial to solving the problem. Currently, the Chahar Provincial Government does not have a Mongolian affairs agency, but it intends to establish temporary organizations related to Mongolian culture and welfare. Regarding the issue of Zhangbei and Qahar's restoration, I intend to seek the opinions of the Mongolian banners first before proceeding. A few days ago, representatives from the nine banners of the Chahar region and the Silingol League's Sonid Right Banner came to Zhangjiakou to request the issuance of firearms to facilitate self-defense and to request relief. Currently, the communist forces in northern Chahar only have the two independent regiments under Lingdong's Ji Xiushan and Oqir. More than a hundred people from the latter have recently surrendered their weapons to the Urad Middle Banner. The area where Suiyuan Province borders Outer Mongolia is still calm. I have ordered a ban on Chinese citizens carrying weapons in and out of the country.

### Envoys from Siam and the Holy See to China Presented Credentials Yesterday; The Chairman Delivered Separate Responses to the Two Envoys

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The first envoys from Siam and the Holy See to China presented their credentials on the 28th. The Siamese Ambassador, Anutra Leek, and the Papal Nuncio, Antonino Riberi, separately presented their credentials to Chairman Chiang at the National Government at 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM on the 28th. Those who accompanied them were the Second Secretary of the Siamese Embassy, Pitsanu Nildilratana, the Third Secretary Arun Jareonsuk-thong, the Counselor of the Papal Nunciature, Gao Yuqian, the First Secretary, Gregory Collins, and the Second Secretary, Chen Zhemin. Wang Shijie, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wu Pingjing, Secretary-General of the National Government, Wu Siyu, Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies, Li Jun, Director of the Department of Protocol, Liu Naibo, Section Chief of the Bureau of Ceremonies, and Ji Zheng, Section Chief of the Third Section of the Department of Protocol, all participated in the ceremony, with Wang Section Chief serving as the interpreter. The addresses of the two envoys and Chairman Chiang's responses are recorded separately as follows:

Address by the Siamese Ambassador

Your Excellency Chairman: I have been appointed as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Republic of China by the Regency Council representing the King of Siam, and I am greatly honored to present my credentials to Your Excellency in person. At the same time, I am also instructed by the Regency Council to extend to Your Excellency the sincere congratulations of the King, and to wish Your Excellency good health and the prosperity of your country. The friendship between China and Siam has a long history, which is due to the close relationship between the two countries. For example, many of your people reside in Siam, living in peace and prosperity, and passing down their traditions from generation to generation. The harmonious relationship between the people of China and Siam is a testament to this friendly relationship, which has been further consolidated by the recently concluded Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship. I assure Your Excellency that the government and myself, in the capacity of the first envoy to China, will spare no effort to maintain the friendly relations between our two countries and to strengthen them day by day. I am greatly pleased to have been entrusted with this position and to be able to inaugurate a new era of friendship between China and Siam. I sincerely hope that Your Excellency will show sympathy and guidance in the performance of my duties, and that the government and people of your country will grant full cooperation, which is what I earnestly desire.

Chairman Chiang's Response

Your Excellency Ambassador: The Regency Council of your country, representing the King of Siam, has dispatched Your Excellency as the first Siamese Ambassador to China. I am greatly pleased to accept your credentials in person. I am most grateful for the warm sentiments and blessings conveyed by Your Excellency on behalf of your government, and I request that you convey my sincere thanks to the King and the Regency Council of your country. During the Second World War, the vicious forces of the Japanese aggressors caused great suffering to the people of your country, and the Chinese people feel infinite sympathy. This is because, as Your Excellency mentioned, the friendship between China and Siam has a long history, and there are indeed various close relationships between the two countries. Many of our people reside in Siam, living in peace and prosperity, and passing down their traditions from generation to generation, which we find most gratifying. Moreover, we firmly believe that due to the conclusion of the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship, the formal diplomatic relations between your two countries will be established, and the friendship between the two nations of China and Siam will surely be strengthened. Your Excellency is experienced and resided in our wartime capital during our country's resistance against Japanese aggression. I am doubly pleased and welcome Your Excellency's appointment as the first Siamese Ambassador to China. I sincerely hope that Your Excellency will have a pleasant stay in China. I will give Your Excellency my heartfelt support, and my government will also give Your Excellency full assistance to complete your noble mission, which I can guarantee to Your Excellency.

Address by the Papal Nuncio

Your Excellency Chairman: I am honored to present my credentials to Your Excellency as the Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Republic of China specially appointed by Pope Pius XII. Today's grand occasion truly continues the events of seven hundred years ago. At that time, when the Western Renaissance laid the foundation for modern civilization, and the military power of Your Country's Yuan Dynasty spanned Europe and Asia, the communication between China and the West was just beginning. The Holy See sent missionaries to communicate with Your Country. Unfortunately, communication was interrupted thereafter, and the cultural exchange between Europe and Asia did not achieve results. Since the discovery of the New World and the opening of sea routes, the Holy See sent famous scholars to preach. Later, due to certain unfortunate problems, the relationship between the two sides became estranged again, and even some unpleasant events could not be avoided, which is very regrettable. Even recently, although the Holy See has repeatedly intended to exchange envoys with Your Country's government, it has not been able to do so due to various reasons. Today, when Your Country's National Assembly is formulating a constitution for the bright future of the nation next to the mausoleum of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the great revolutionary mentor who created the Republic, the Holy See can formally send envoys to reside in Your Country, which is truly the will of God. Under Your Excellency's wise leadership, Your Country fought a long nine-year war of resistance and won the final victory. Now, in a rapid and glorious social transformation, it is advancing freely towards the future of a civilization of several thousand years. The Pope is extremely concerned and sympathetic to Your Country's reforms and construction, and expects that the Catholic Church in Your Country will make a significant contribution. This year, the Pope selected Thomas Tien Ken-hsin as a Cardinal Archbishop to assist in the central affairs of the Holy See and to establish a normal system for the Chinese Church. He also beatified the Chinese martyr-friend, and dispatched envoys to reside in Your Country. All of these are important expressions of the Pope's respect for Your Great Country. I am honored to have encountered this grand occasion at the beginning of my mission, especially at a time when Your Excellency continues to lead the great task of nation-building, which is a great honor. The various grand statements made by Your Excellency in the past are admired by Catholics around the world, especially the broadcast speech on Victory Day, which was most welcomed. Your Excellency said, "I believe that from now on, there will be no distinction between East and West, and no distinction between races. All human beings will accelerate their close union day by day, and become brothers and sisters." This coincides with the Pope's appeal to all nations to eliminate misunderstandings and trust each other. Your Excellency also asked, "The new order of the world should be based on the love revealed by Jesus Christ." This shows the high ideals of Your Excellency, which is an example for Your Country's politicians. This common point of view is an important reason for promoting the close relationship between the Holy See and Your Country, and it is also the deep hope of the Pope for Your Excellency and all the people of Your Country. I wish Your Excellency good health and the prosperity of the Great Republic of China, Antonino Riberi, Papal Nuncio to China.

Chairman Chiang's Response

Your Excellency Envoy, I am delighted to receive your credentials, accepting the appointment of the Holy See's Pope as the Plenipotentiary Minister to the Republic of China. I am deeply grateful for the friendly sentiments you just expressed. Your deep understanding of our nation's history and the fact that the esteemed Pope appointed you as the first Holy See representative to China, restoring the traditional friendship of seven hundred years, makes me feel doubly pleased. With your understanding of the enemy nation's people's love of peace and hope, you are sure to be able to carry this heavy burden with ease. The ideals of China and the Holy See are very similar. Your arrival in China coincides with the National Assembly of our nation, and I deeply hope that the friendly connections between the two sides will increase further. Your embassy is being opened at this time, which is excellent. I am deeply grateful for the esteemed Pope's meticulous concern for the Catholic Church in our nation. This concern is truly manifested in the Pope's four major measures this year, such as appointing Thomas Tien Ken-hsin as a cardinal archbishop, establishing the Chinese Church's formal party system, exalting the Chinese martyred clergy, and assigning you as the resident chairman, which I can guarantee. I wish the Pope good health and the prosperity of your country.

### Disputes Arise Over Year-End Double Pay Issue; Private Newspapers in Nanjing Suspended Publication; Mediation by Relevant Authorities Has Yet to Yield Results

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 28th] All fourteen private newspapers in the capital suspended publication on the 28th. Only the Central Daily News, the Peace Daily News, the Nanjing Daily News (which has not yet joined the newspaper association), and the Social Daily News continued publication. The reason for the suspension was that the workers presented conditions to the employers, requesting double pay at the end of the year and a 60% salary increase starting in December. At 4:00 PM on the 27th, the Bureau of Social Affairs summoned more than a hundred workers to discuss and mediate, but no results were achieved. At 8:00 PM, the Bureau invited the presidents of the various newspapers to a meeting, where the employers stated that they could increase salaries by 40% of the current month's salary, but double pay at the end of the year was impossible. As a result, work did not resume that night. On the morning of the 28th, the employers held another meeting to discuss a solution. At that time, it was decided (1) to increase salaries by 40%, (2) to not agree to double pay at the end of the year, and (3) to limit the resumption of publication to tonight, otherwise the authorities would seal the factories, and the workers' food and lodging would be suspended from the 29th until work resumed. In the afternoon, the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Garrison Headquarters came forward to mediate, summoning representatives from the workers' side to negotiate, but no agreement was reached. The employers continued to negotiate at the Shanghai Hotel in the evening, while the workers' representatives were also at a certain hotel. As of 8:00 PM in the afternoon, there were still no results.

[Another Dispatch] Regarding the labor-management dispute of the private newspapers, the Central Propaganda Department specially dispatched Section Chief Zhou at 9:00 PM on the 28th to continue discussing solutions with Zhang You-shuang, the president of the Nanjing People's News and representative of the fourteen newspapers, and two representatives of the workers' side, but no concrete results were achieved. However, an agreement has been reached on the issue of salary increases. As for the issue of double pay at the end of the year, the employers have also expressed a willingness to compromise, and only the name "double pay" remains to be discussed.

### Li Di-jun Returns from Comforting Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies; Details the Process; Reports to the Chairman in Nanjing Last Night

[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Di-jun, our country's envoy to Cuba, was dispatched two months ago to comfort overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies and returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Mr. Li held a reception for reporters at the Cathay Hotel at 11:00 AM yesterday, detailing the comforting process and the situation of the local overseas Chinese.

Mr. Li first stated: The overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies have been separated from their motherland for a long time due to the War of Resistance, but their patriotic enthusiasm has not diminished as a result. During the two months, the comforting group reached more than forty places. When the overseas Chinese saw the comforting group, it was as if they were seeing the parents of their motherland. Everyone was extremely excited, warmly welcomed them, and sincerely thanked the motherland's government for not forgetting the overseas Chinese. The further away the overseas Chinese were from the political center of Batavia, the deeper their patriotism was.

Strong Patriotism

The environment in which the overseas Chinese found themselves was quite complex: During the war, they suffered extremely heavy sacrifices, and their material losses were even greater. Wealthy and intelligent overseas Chinese were imprisoned in concentration camps by the enemy. In West Borneo, more than 700 overseas Chinese were beheaded and killed by the enemy. However, after the victory, due to the Indonesian revolutionary movement, the overseas Chinese were in great pain under the struggle of the Allied forces (i.e., the British army), the Dutch East Indies Provisional Government, and the Indonesian government. There are a total of two million overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, of which 1.2 million came from the motherland and 800,000 were born locally. The overseas Chinese have a high economic status, and their educational level is superior to that of overseas Chinese in other countries. Intellectuals can speak fluent Mandarin and are proficient in Dutch, English, Malay, German, and other languages. In the past, there seemed to be a wide gap between the locally born overseas Chinese and the newcomers (i.e., those who went to the Dutch East Indies from China), and they did not get along well. This was because the locally born overseas Chinese grew up under the rule of the Dutch East Indies government and were isolated from the motherland. However, since the war and the Indonesian independence movement, their attitude has changed, and their national concept has gradually become stronger. Now, they are all learning Chinese characters and studying the situation in China.

The Situation in Indonesia

In the past two or three months, the situation in the Dutch East Indies has become more stable. The Netherlands signed a ceasefire agreement with Indonesia on October 15 and a draft political agreement on December 15, but the official signing will have to wait until the Dutch Parliament passes it. Although local conflicts are still inevitable, they will not affect the lives and property of the overseas Chinese. After the political agreement is signed, the Netherlands will recognize the establishment of an Indonesian Republic on the three islands of Java, Sumatra, and Madura. By January 1, 1949, a United States of Indonesia will be formed, and all other islands can participate as a unit on an equal footing, except for the Republic. The Dutch royal family will be a liaison organization for the United States. However, the military and political affairs of Indonesia itself are extremely complex. The local armed forces are divided into regular troops, militia, and extremist elements. These extremist elements desperately hoped that China would assist them, but in the past year, China's own problems have not been resolved and it has been unable to help, which has inevitably led to disappointment. In retaliation, they often harass our overseas Chinese. This time, Mr. Li summoned leaders from various places to explain in detail, saying: According to the teachings of the Founding Father, China is very sympathetic to the revolutions of any small and weak nation, especially Asian nations. China and the Dutch East Indies have a history of economic and cultural exchanges that dates back 1,500 years. The Chinese government absolutely hopes to continue to maintain friendship and cooperate with each other in the future, and to do its best to assist, but the degree of assistance must be based on guaranteeing the lives and property of the overseas Chinese. Mr. Li has summarized ten points of opinion and submitted them to the Indonesian Prime Minister, who has expressed his apology and believes that the same incidents will not happen again in the future. He has decided to gradually implement the opinions put forward. Indonesia will also send a delegation to visit China next year. There are more than fifty political parties in Indonesia, including the Indonesian Chinese Party, which has about 2,000 members.

Points of Depression

The problems that overseas Chinese find difficult to solve are: (1) Overseas Chinese in both the Dutch East Indies area, the Indonesian area, and the border area (the border between the two governments) are treated unfairly, with those in the Indonesian area being better off. (2) The issue of nationality: According to recent Indonesian law, any Chinese born in Indonesia should be an Indonesian citizen. Those who do not wish to be Indonesian citizens must make a public statement before the end of April next year. However, although overseas Chinese do not wish to be Indonesian citizens, they are also afraid that making a statement will be detrimental to themselves, so they still maintain dual citizenship. (3) Although the Indonesian revolution claims to have been influenced by China's Xinhai Revolution and believes that it is also the Three Principles of the People, it still imposes controls on the economic status of the overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese earnestly hope that Chinese government economic experts will provide assistance and support and plan to send representatives back to China next spring for inspection.

The comforting group has solved some problems for the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies. For example, when the enemy occupied the Dutch East Indies, the local authorities adopted a scorched earth policy. Most of the losses suffered were the property of overseas Chinese. After negotiations, the Dutch East Indies government has agreed to compensate. At present, 30% of the factories have begun to be repaired, and 60% can be restored within three or four months, and the restoration will continue thereafter, but not all of them can be compensated. The authorities have also agreed to compensate for the materials requisitioned from the overseas Chinese by the Japanese. In principle, the authorities have also recognized the loss compensation, and the overseas Chinese have now begun to report.

Remittance Problems

As for the remittance problem, the authorities have agreed to open it from January next year, but stipulate that all overseas Chinese can remit a total of 10,000 guilders, and then gradually increase it depending on the situation. According to the current official price, one US dollar is equal to 2.66 guilders.

Mr. Li also stated that before returning to China, he had submitted 18 points regarding the overseas Chinese to the Dutch East Indies government, and the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies had agreed to handle them.

Mr. Li went to Nanjing by train last night to report to the Chairman and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and to make suggestions. He will come to Shanghai again in the middle of next month to discuss the Luo fund issue with Central Bank Governor Bei Tsu-yi. Mr. Li also stated: All parties are satisfied with this comforting work, and it cannot be said that the task of comforting the overseas Chinese has been completed, but rather that it is the beginning of solving the problems of the overseas Chinese.

### Our Delegates to the UN General Assembly, Liu Kai, etc., Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Today

[Report from Our City] Liu Kai, our Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and delegate to the United Nations General Assembly, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from San Francisco on a US plane at 3:35 PM today. The plane departed from San Francisco on the 26th of this month and will land at Jiangwan Airport. There are a total of eighteen passengers, including Vice Minister Liu, Deputy Delegates to the General Assembly, personnel from the Bank of China and Citibank, and specialized technical staff from UNRRA. The plane is a C/54 type transport plane with the tail number NC7906 and is carrying approximately one thousand pounds of letters and prizes. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs here has prepared to send personnel to the airport to welcome them.

### Personnel Changes at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Dong Lin Appointed as Advisor

[United Press, Nanjing, 28th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently announced the appointment of Sun Bingqian as Consul General in Bangkok. Dong Lin, former envoy to the Dutch East Indies, was appointed as Advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Wang Nianqu, former First Secretary of the Embassy in Iran, was transferred to Bern, the capital of Switzerland, remaining in his original position.

### Principal Culprits in the Shibuya Incident Indicted; Police Chief and Others "Violated the Objectives of the Occupation Forces"

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] The three-member committee of the Yokohama Military Tribunal formally indicted three senior officials of the Shibuya Police Station on the 5th, who witnessed the shooting incident between Japanese police and Allied citizens on July 19, saying that they "violated the objectives of the occupation forces." The three are Shibuya Police Chief Soji Tsuchiya, Deputy Chief (name omitted), and Chunwei Miyagi, the police inspector in charge of Overseas Chinese affairs at the station. The Chief and Deputy Chief of the police station are accused of maliciously and erroneously ordering the police under their jurisdiction to fire excessively and unnecessarily at the crowd (including United Nations people), resulting in the deaths of seven people and injuries to several people. This action clearly disrupted peace and caused terror among the people in the area and therefore violated the self-imposed goals of the occupation forces. It is reported that a total of forty Taiwanese people were involved in the Shibuya incident, and they were recently sentenced by another three-member committee in Tokyo to two and three years of labor or deportation.

### Philippine Overseas Chinese Stallholders Sue Finance Minister Cuaderno: Order to Eliminate Stallholders Exceeds Legal Provisions

[Central News Agency, Manila, 28th] Eight hundred Chinese stallholders recently sued Philippine Finance Minister Cuaderno in the Manila court. The city government accountant and the local market officials believe this is their last resort to prevent these officials from seizing their stalls in the local market. The overseas Chinese stallholders pointed out that the mandatory order issued by Finance Minister Cuaderno on November 26, which declared that all stalls in any public market should be vacated by the original owners, and that anyone setting up a stall after December 31 would be considered an ineligible applicant, does not comply with Article 37 of the Philippine Republic's regulations, therefore, his order is invalid and has no binding power on private individuals. They said that the matter involved in this order exceeds the powers prescribed by law.

### Northeastern Patriots Yang Ziping and Others: Fourteen Years of Unredressed Grievances

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 28th] In the second year after the September 18th Incident fourteen years ago, when the League of Nations Lytton Commission came to the Northeast, local citizen Li Ziping and others, in order to report the true situation of the Japanese invasion of the Northeast, secretly met with Dr. Lytton at his residence and explained everything. After the Lytton Commission left, Yang and others were arrested by the Japanese military police. Later, Japanese military policemen Katoro Tsuruji and Miyata Churyo, among others, subjected them to inhumane torture, and many people were implicated and arrested. Yang and others were then taken to the Japanese special service agency. The agency's chief, Major General Miura, disregarding international law, illegally tried them, falsely accusing Yang Ziping and others of being spies for the United States and Britain and having connections with the Kuomintang Party, and charged them with crimes against national security. On July 7 of the same year, Yang Ziping, Xu Fanjiu, and others were paraded in shackles to create terror, and then executed en masse. This tragic case has been buried for fourteen years. Now, after being reported by the victim's family, Yang Tingmin, the Northeast Headquarters War Crimes Tribunal has filed a public prosecution. However, the defendants Katoro, Tada, Miura, and others are all at large. It is reported that the War Crimes Tribunal has submitted the matter to the relevant authorities and telegraphed General MacArthur's headquarters to find ways to track them down.

### Bangkok Overseas Chinese Schools Issue Joint Statement Demanding Revision of Education Regulations

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 27th] Sixty-seven overseas Chinese schools in Bangkok recently issued a joint statement expressing their attitude towards the Ministry of Education's recent order requiring overseas Chinese schools to register with the ministry within fifteen days. The joint statement stated that they could not register under the current education regulations promulgated by the former Thai dictator, Luang Phibunsongkhram. They demanded (1) that Chinese language classes in the curriculum of overseas Chinese primary schools should be twelve hours per week, cancelling the original provision of five and a half hours per week; (2) that principals and teachers below the fourth grade of primary school should not be required to be proficient in Siamese; and (3) that overseas Chinese children should have the freedom to choose the school they attend, whether it be an overseas Chinese school or a Siamese school. The statement expressed a deep desire for the current education regulations to be revised so that the overseas Chinese education problem could be resolved as soon as possible.

### Dalian American Ship Incident: Washington Has Not Received Detailed Report

[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson said that regarding the Dalian incident, the State Department has not yet made a final conclusion because it has not yet received a detailed official report from that area. Acheson said that the American Consul in Dalian, Penninghoff, has not yet reported directly to the State Department. Acheson declined to comment on whether the Soviet authorities in Dalian had issued an ultimatum to the American naval mail ship ordering it to leave immediately.

### Postal Administration Stipulates Measures to Preferentially Treat Airmail Newspapers

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] In order to give preferential treatment to newspapers from all over the country sending airmail, the Post Office has specifically stipulated (1) that the weight limit for each piece of airmail newspaper is the same as for ordinary mail, and (2) that airmail newspapers sent between different locations via airmail can be bundled into one bundle for several copies sent to the same location, and charged as an airmail book small packet. For those sent to various parts of the interior using a portion of airmail, several small rolls sent by the same airmail transportation bureau may be bundled into one piece. In addition to paying the fees as stipulated above, an additional ordinary postage for first-class newspapers will be charged at ten yuan national currency per 50 kilograms.

### Hong Kong Housing Shortage Severe: Overseas Chinese Groups Form Repatriation Association to Repatriate Unemployed and Impoverished Compatriots

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 27th] In the year since repatriation, Hong Kong's population has surged, estimated at about 1.5 million. The housing shortage problem has become increasingly serious, and the number of people sleeping on the streets has reached tens of thousands. The Hong Kong authorities recently instructed major overseas Chinese groups to organize a Repatriation Association to register homeless and unemployed impoverished compatriots, and the government will fund their repatriation. The first phase will repatriate 20,000 people and will be implemented in the short term.

### Huwei and Datong Banks: Business Quite Developed

[Our City News] Yesterday, this newspaper published a Chongqing dispatch stating: "All Shanghai branches of the Yu Jianguo, Chengda, Huwei, and Datong banks have successively suspended exchange." This newspaper's reporter specially inquired about the truth from the financial circles of this city and learned that Huwei and Datong banks have been established for many years, are known for their stability, have ample reserves, and their business is quite developed. There has never been any news of the above-mentioned situation. The Chongqing dispatch is probably based on inaccurate reporting.

Editorial

### The Increasingly Serious French-Vietnamese Conflict

The scope of the French-Vietnamese conflict is expanding day by day, and it is no longer comparable to ordinary incidents. The consequences will not only endanger peace in a corner of the Far East, but will also be sufficient to affect the development of the entire world political situation, so it has attracted the attention of countries around the world. British Foreign Secretary Bevin has asked the Cabinet to study the current Vietnam problem based on the reports submitted by the British Ambassador to France and Lord Killearn, the Special Envoy to Southeast Asia. American Acting Secretary of State Acheson also told the press that although the Vietnam problem is a matter for the French government, the American government has maintained close contact with the French government and hopes that Mr. Moutet, the French Minister of Overseas Colonies, who is currently investigating the truth at the site of the French-Vietnamese conflict, will submit a report as soon as possible. Although this passage is very tactful diplomatic rhetoric, lightly describing it and not carrying a particularly serious meaning, the anxiety in its heart regarding the situation in Vietnam cannot be concealed. In China, because 435,800 compatriots reside in Vietnam, "when the city gate catches fire, the fish in the moat are also affected." In any conflict that occurs in Vietnam, the lives and property of overseas Chinese compatriots will inevitably suffer major losses. Although the Chinese Consul General in Hanoi has repeatedly made suggestions to both the French and Vietnamese sides, advocating the demarcation of a neutral zone in Vietnam so that overseas Chinese and peace-loving Vietnamese people can live there, this safety plan has never been realized, further causing the Chinese government to worry about the safety of the lives and property of these many overseas Chinese compatriots, so it has no choice but to take concrete and effective measures to protect them.

From the perspective of countries such as China, Britain, and the United States, of course everyone hopes that both the French and Vietnamese sides can lay down their arms. On the Vietnamese side, no more terrorist actions should be taken; on the French side, no more high-pressure policies should be adopted. With a spirit of peace and friendship, negotiations should be reopened to seek a thorough solution to the Vietnam problem. In fact, for the sake of France's actual interests, France should also quickly find a way to achieve a peaceful resolution. For example, the Political Committee of the French Communist Party passed a resolution also advocating that the French government should immediately hold peace talks with the Viet Minh government, so that both sides can cooperate loyally within the scope of the French Union, and stating that some reactionaries in France directly oppose the Viet Minh government and that taking violent and provocative actions is also detrimental to the national interest. After taking office as Prime Minister, the leader of the Socialist Party, Blum, also assured the French people that the French government would definitely strive to achieve the early restoration of peace in accordance with the spirit of the French-Vietnamese agreement. Whether Prime Minister Blum can fulfill the promises he has made domestically and internationally, the current French-Vietnamese conflict is the best touchstone.

However, based on comprehensive reports from all sides, the attitude that France has adopted towards Vietnam can be seen in the following aspects: (1) The French military authorities, under government orders, urgently transferred reinforcements to Vietnam; (2) French Minister of Overseas Colonies Moutet gave a speech in Saigon, firmly rejecting the Vietnamese people's demands for independence, and saying that "France will never grant the people of Cochinchina and southern Annam the right to national self-determination"; (3) French aircraft have officially participated in the war, bombing Viet Minh troop concentration points over Hanoi; (4) A preliminary report released by the French government investigation team also stated that Vietnam should bear full responsibility for the French-Vietnamese conflict; (5) The press officer of the Viet Minh government's delegation in France was arrested by French police in Marseille.

From the above, it is undoubtedly that the French government, in order to maintain its prestige in Vietnam, is bound to act recklessly to the end. On the Vietnamese side, the Vietnamese people have been inspired by nationalism! They are fighting to the end for the liberation of the nation and will never retreat in the face of difficulties or give up halfway. President Ho Chi Minh of the Viet Minh Republic issued a Christmas broadcast on the 25th of this month, demanding that French troops withdraw from the entire territory of Vietnam. In addition, Mr. Nguyen Tuong Tam, the leader of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party, is also active in Nanjing. In addition to appealing to China and the United States to mediate the French-Vietnamese conflict, he also advocated the organization of a "National Front Government" to prepare to resolve grievances and make peace with the Viet Minh government, in order to fight for independence with a common goal and fight France to the end. At the same time, Viet Minh troops scattered throughout the country have taken the offensive, engaging in a desperate battle with the French army, making the scope of the French-Vietnamese conflict grow larger and larger.

If this worrying situation is allowed to develop naturally without finding ways to remedy it, it will have very serious consequences, which are unimaginable. Therefore, at this critical moment, French politicians should be able to have a broad and long-term vision, make decisive decisions, and quickly bring an end to the bloody tragedy in Vietnam. Standing from the position of a third party, we would like to offer advice to the French authorities: First, the French authorities in charge must know that in today's world after the end of World War II, the era of imperialism has long become a historical relic. France must not treat Vietnam by following the colonial policies of the past. If the responsibility for the occurrence of this French-Vietnamese conflict is to be investigated, then the blame lies not with Vietnam, but with the French High Commissioner to Vietnam, Admiral Thierry d'Argenlieu, and the Commissioner to Cochinchina, Cédile, who should bear full responsibility. Because they have not changed their past treatment of colonies in their treatment of Vietnam, which has aroused the public indignation of the Vietnamese people, which has led to this unfortunate incident. Second, the thinking and politics of the French people have made considerable progress since the war. In particular, the new French constitution has far-reaching ideals and is admired by countries around the world; however, it does not yet have a thorough understanding of the sacred principle of national self-determination. The speech given by French Overseas Minister Moutet in Saigon not only cannot have a stabilizing effect, but will only add fuel to the fire and unnecessarily deepen the Vietnamese people's hatred of France. Third, we also know that the Vietnam problem is sufficient to cause political turmoil in France, but the Blum government is blindly adopting a high-pressure policy, attempting to resolve the Vietnam problem by force. We believe that its result will inevitably be failure, because the morale of the Vietnamese people cannot be insulted and cannot be conquered by airplanes, artillery, and tanks.

In short, the situation in Vietnam is becoming more and more serious. The French authorities in charge should remain calm, reconsider the policies they have adopted, and make a prudent decision quickly, so as to prevent the situation from deteriorating further and falling into an unrecoverable predicament.

### Thorough Suppression of Bandits in Hongze Lake: More Than 20,000 Bandits Annihilated: A Major Disaster Removed from the Jiangsu-Anhui Border

[Our Newspaper, Huaiyin News] Hongze Lake crosses the two provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui, with a vast area and dense reeds, traditionally an area where bandits roam. Salt merchants consider it a long and dangerous journey, and they often use armed escorts to ensure safety. However, robberies and kidnappings still occur from time to time. Although the security authorities have sent personnel to lead troops to suppress them, and have organized armed self-defense by fishing households, the bandits have fled and returned, and they have not been completely eliminated. This is truly a major hidden danger in the heartland of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, and local people are deeply worried. According to visitors near the lake, in mid-month, the national army, in coordination with local armed forces, launched an encirclement and suppression of the bandits, forcing them into the depths of the reed marshes. More than 20,000 bandits were annihilated. Only a hundred or so injured bandits managed to escape, fleeing towards Si, Su, and Lianshui. The pursuers intercepted them along the way, killing many more. When they reached Zhangguandang in the western border of Lianshui, they were captured by the local troops. Only the bandit leader, Shi Zhenguo, and a dozen or so others escaped into the middle of the Before and After Six Ponds River. Everyone was overjoyed. A major disaster has been removed from the two provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui, and water traffic on the lake can proceed unhindered. The lake is rich in fish, gorgon fruit, firewood, and grass, and can be safely harvested, which will provide considerable help to the livelihood of the people.

### Arrest of Fleeing Traitors: Confiscation and Disposal of Illegal Assets: Jiangsu High Court President Sun Dispels Doubts

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 28th] Sun Honglin, President of the Jiangsu High Court, was previously dispatched as the chief examiner for the county magistrate examination in Jiangsu Province. After completing his official duties, he went to Nanjing to ask for instructions and returned to Suzhou on the evening of the 27th. This newspaper's reporter asked Sun about the question of how to close the cases of some traitors that were not captured even after orders for arrest were issued, and how their illegal assets would be disposed of, since the work of eliminating traitors in Jiangsu Province had been going on for more than a year. Sun explained: If a traitorous criminal cannot be found during the investigation period, and the prosecutor has conducted a comprehensive investigation and believes that the evidence of the crime is conclusive, then in addition to filing a public prosecution and transferring the case to the criminal court, he can also issue an arrest warrant in the name of the chief prosecutor. After receiving the indictment, if the criminal court believes that it is indeed impossible to bring the accused to justice, it can issue an arrest warrant again in the name of the president of the court. The trial process will be suspended until the case is solved. However, if the criminal court believes that there is still a possibility of bringing the accused to justice, then it should still follow the judicial procedure of three summons and three arrests. As for the illegal assets of these traitors who have already been wanted, the prosecutor's office will seal them up, but will not carry out confiscation. It must be after the arrest and return to the court, and the criminal court hears the case and announces the confiscation of the property before it can be executed.

### Anhui Province Transfers Three County Magistrates

### Suzhou Organizes Committee to Relieve the Poor

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 28th] The weather has been very cold in recent weeks, and frozen bodies have been found on the streets from time to time. Winter relief is already imminent. However, due to the difficult social economy and the decline of commerce, it has not been started for a long time. Cao Yongxiang, commander of the Suzhou Garrison, in view of this, gathered party and community leaders on the morning of the 28th to discuss solutions, and immediately decided to organize the Wu County Poor Relief Committee. Cao was publicly elected as the chairman of the committee, and County Magistrate Shen Chengneng and Chamber of Commerce Chairman Zhang Shoupeng were elected as the vice-chairmen. The main targets for relief are the elderly, young, sick, and homeless vagrants and beggars, with a quota of 600 people temporarily set. The budget is 100 million yuan, which will be donated or raised in full by the Entertainment Association, the Chamber of Commerce, and gentry. This relief is not limited to winter, but is a permanent organization. However, its work is not purely passive relief, but its main purpose is to gradually cultivate production skills through part-time work and part-time study, with the aim of being completely self-sufficient after three months. Therefore, in addition to shelter, preparations are being made to establish a large-scale vocational training center, which is said to be a fundamental foundation for establishing cleanliness in Suzhou City.

### Qingpu Huge Fraud: Falsely Claiming the Name of the Ministry of National Defense: Claiming to Organize a Military Force to Embezzle Money

[Our Newspaper, Qingpu News] The county government arrested Gao Er, a perpetrator of large-scale fraud under the name of the Ministry of National Defense, on the 25th. He is a native of Tainan Township in this county. He usually does not engage in legitimate business, but specializes in deception. Recently, he had a whimsical idea and actually persuaded villagers in the township, claiming that he knew a certain senior official in the Ministry of National Defense, and was now on a secret mission to organize a "Youth Party Army" to recruit able-bodied young men in the township. It would be established in the first month of next year, and each person would have firearms and uniforms to work in the township, monitoring officials at all levels, with great power, and would not go out to work, so they could be exempt from military service, with a salary of 300,000 yuan per month. There was a superior captain who was now in Shanghai, ordering him to recruit in the township, and each recruit would first pay a handling fee of 240,000 yuan to pay for his travel arrangements and registration fees, etc. This was a bunch of nonsense, wildly exaggerated. The ignorant villagers did not know the truth and fell into his trap. More than 20 people in Songjiang, Tianwei District (bordering Xiangnan) were deceived and paid to "enlist." The matter was discovered by the authorities. Because the perpetrator dared to falsely claim a name and deceive the public for money, he was really defying the law and discipline. He was handed over to the military court for interrogation and punishment. It is said that there are still many accomplices who are being secretly detained.

### Suzhou Circles Rebuild Shaw Memorial

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou News] American pilot and martyr Shaw fought with righteous indignation when the Japanese invaded Shanghai on January 28. He flew an aircraft to assist our 19th Route Army in the war. Unfortunately, he was surrounded by six Japanese aircraft, and he was overwhelmed and shot down in Gaodian Town, Chefang, in the southern countryside of Suzhou, and he died heroically.

### Jiangyin County Tax Collection Embezzlement Case: Errors in Reported Figures

[Our Jiangyin Dispatch] At a meeting of the county provisional council on the 23rd, Councilor Zou Zongshe stated that embezzlement had occurred in the collection of land tax in kind. Based on the county's total amount of grain collected in kind, the price of rice was inflated by 4,000 yuan per picul. Calculating with a total of 270,000 piculs, the total would be 1.08 million yuan. Discounting by 30%, it would reach 300,000 yuan. At the time, a neighboring councilor pointed out that there were considerable discrepancies in the figures due to calculation errors. Upon investigation by the reporter with the Land and Food Office, the total amount of land tax collected in kind, requisitioned, and public grain for this year in this county is 235,711 piculs and six dou, with 23,571 piculs and one dou and six sheng accumulated in grain, totaling 259,282 piculs and seven dou and six sheng. Even if all of it was embezzled, the amount would only be 100.04 million yuan. The initial statement of 1.08 million yuan, discounted by 30% to 300,000 yuan, was indeed an error. At the time, the recording did not pay attention to the correction. After it was published in this newspaper on the 26th, it caused a stir in society. The reporter, considering the significant impact of these figures, specially investigated the detailed amount of grain collected in kind with the Land and Food Office to clarify the truth, as detailed above. Furthermore, Deputy Director Hong of the Land and Food Office was summoned back to the town by the province on the 26th to provide a detailed account of the situation and await a thorough investigation. Additionally, the person in charge of the Land and Food Office stated that since the beginning of the collection, the total amount collected and the amount of land tax borrowed in advance is approximately below 100,000 piculs, and by the end of this month, it may reach around 150,000 piculs.

### All Silk Factories in Wuxi County Temporarily Suspend Operations

### Multiple Unidentified Male Corpses Discovered in Mud Cave on the Border of Wujin and Danyang. Rumors Say They Were All Victims of Bandit Kidnappings and Murders

[Our Wujin Dispatch] In the northwestern border area of this county, bordering the Fangxian District of Danyang County, there is a small mountain called Mud Mountain, which connects to Jiashan, which belongs to Wujin. The mountain produces Guanyin powder, which is white, delicate, and tasteless and can be used to make wine medicine pills. The poor can use it to fill their stomachs. During agricultural off-seasons, the local people often take the extraction of Guanyin powder as a side business. Over the years, the entire mountain has been dug all around, forming numerous caves, like a honeycomb or an underground chamber. During the period of occupation, nearby people often hid inside to avoid the atrocities of the enemy. Bandit leader Guan Wenwei also used to frequent the area, using it as a base.

### Atomic Energy Commission Continues Meeting. Soviet and Polish Representatives Take Passive Stance. Baruch Firmly Opposes Veto Power. New U.S. Proposal Passed, Awaiting Final Decision

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 27th] The drafting subcommittee of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission held a closed meeting today and passed its final report to the Security Council. At that time, the French representative, Parodi, with the support of the British representative, strenuously argued that the report should not involve the issue of veto power. This issue has caused debate between France, Britain, Canada, and Poland on one side and China, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Australia on the other. Soviet representative, Alexander, refused to participate in the debate. According to reports, the French representative had previously submitted a clause to the U.S. delegation, arguing that in the event of an act of aggression constituting an international crime, "the offending country should not be able to evade the consequences of its unlawful act by reasonable means." The U.S. representative suggested adding the phrase "by veto power or other means" to define the term "reasonable means." However, the French representative firmly opposed this, believing that including this phrase would give the impression that the Atomic Energy Commission intended to amend the United Nations Charter. Conversely, U.S. representative Baruch strongly supported the U.S. proposal to maintain the principle of unanimity as stipulated in the Charter. Finally, the committee passed the new U.S. proposal, with the addition of a note stating that the Soviet Union did not participate in the debate and that all other points were unanimously agreed upon except for the inclusion of the phrase "by veto power or other means." However, this matter is still awaiting final decision by the entire committee. Representatives from Britain and Canada have indicated that they will abide by the majority and comply with this resolution, but the French representative stated that he must consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before deciding on a course of action.

[United Press, Lake Success, 27th] U.S. representative Baruch today candidly announced at the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission that the United States could not relinquish the secrets of the atomic bomb unless the five major powers did not exercise their veto power over the punishment of those who violated the atomic energy agreement. The committee held a closed meeting today to discuss the U.S. proposal for atomic energy control for eight hours. Baruch requested that this issue be voted on in public, stating: "Under any system that allows cunning means to nullify punishment, I cannot recommend to the American people and the Senate that we relinquish this powerful weapon and make public the great knowledge of producing atomic energy. What we are asking for is that when voting on whether a country or its allies should be punished for violating the agreement, they should not use their own veto power. Conversely, if it is believed that violators should have this right, then they can vote against our position, or abstain from or refuse to vote." Baruch's so-called refusal to participate in the vote clearly refers to the Soviet Union and Poland, as the Soviet Union has stated that it will not participate in the vote, and Poland has indicated that it will abstain from voting. Earlier, Baruch also stated: The core of the issue lies in whether the sanctity of the treaty or the veto should be sacred, and he said in a sharp tone: "I do not know why a country that intends to uphold the treaty needs a veto power. Because only countries that intend to violate the treaty need the protection of the veto power." Before Baruch spoke, the British and French representatives agreed to ban the use of veto power but opposed explicitly stipulating it in the final draft. The British representative stated that the reason for taking this position was to seek unanimity and avoid Soviet opposition.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 27th] The executive committee of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission held a meeting this morning to discuss the technical part of the report passed by the political subcommittee on the control of atomic energy, and immediately approved it. Representatives from Poland and the Soviet Union were not present, so all parties continue to speculate on the future attitudes of the two countries. In addition, the executive committee decided to continue the meeting this afternoon, and the issues to be discussed are two: (1) Discuss the draft resolution jointly proposed by the United States and Canada, which was passed in the previous closed meeting, and the principles it follows are roughly similar to the plan of U.S. representative Baruch, but it does not mention the issue of veto power; (2) Decide on the attitude that the executive committee should take towards the following two issues, namely (a) the plan proposed by U.S. representative Baruch, (b) the issue of permanent members of the Security Council exercising veto power on sanctions. If the executive committee cannot reach an agreement, and the Soviet Union and Poland are absent again, the French delegation will propose a compromise plan, dividing sanctions into two types, large and small, stipulating that permanent members of the Security Council may use veto power for small sanctions, but not for large sanctions.

### Vietnam War Expands Southward. Fierce Battles Along the Entire Front in Northern and Central Vietnam

[United Press, Paris, 27th] According to news from the French side today: The war in Vietnam has expanded to southern Cochinchina, with 24 civilian casualties. The uncompromising attitudes of the French and Vietnamese sides are becoming increasingly apparent, and French troops have imposed martial law in Saigon. On Christmas Eve, three cars carrying Annamese, Indians, and overseas Chinese on a highway near Saigon were attacked, resulting in 20 deaths, including one Briton. Another car carrying a group of priests and Annamese children was ambushed, killing two children and seriously injuring four priests. French officials explained that these nighttime sniper attacks were attempts by Viet Minh guerrillas to cut off transportation throughout southern Cochinchina or as a preliminary step to carry out such attacks throughout northern Vietnam. In addition, scattered reports indicate multiple fierce clashes along the entire front in northern and central Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, broadcast a statement on a secret radio station, demanding that French troops withdraw from all of Vietnam.

### Root Cause of the French-Vietnamese Conflict

American Newspapers Believe Compromise Hopes Are Slim

[Reuters, New York, 27th] The New York Times carried an editorial today on the Vietnam situation, predicting that the conflict there cannot be resolved for the time being and will expand. The newspaper's reporter, who met with French officials in Vietnam and various leaders of the underground movements in Cochinchina and Annam earlier this month, believes that the root cause of the Franco-Vietnamese dispute lies in the status of Cochinchina. Therefore, the Viet Minh government may order Annamese underground activists in the rice-producing region of Cochinchina to begin operations and open a second front. When the newspaper's reporter was in Vietnam, the ceasefire agreement in Cochinchina was still respected, but the illegal "Annam Executive Committee" was still engaged in active political activities, while the French authorities used high-pressure tactics to deal with those who opposed the pro-French Republic of Cochinchina, such as prohibiting newspapers from publishing words that the French side considered critical. As for arresting Annamese guerrillas, it was a common occurrence. As for the methods of both sides, from a neutral standpoint, they both seem to be excessive. Therefore, France and the Viet Minh are constantly in an explosive state of tension. The root of the Vietnam War lies in the Viet Minh's dissatisfaction with the Fontainebleau Agreements (the agreement between Ho Chi Minh and the French government) and the Viet Minh's attempt to incorporate Cochinchina into its republic. Of course, this attempt is difficult for France to approve. Given the wide divergence of positions on both sides, the hope of compromise seems extremely slim.

### Indian Newspapers Vigorously Criticize French Colonial Policy

[United Press, New Delhi, 27th] Several newspapers in central and northern India today published articles strongly condemning the actions of the French army in Vietnam. The National Daily, hosted by Nehru in Lucknow, titled its editorial "Vietnam Erupts," stating that the atrocities currently occurring in Vietnam can only be explained by France's desire to maintain its colonies in various forms and under various names. The Vietnamese people's resistance to this tyrannical policy of France should be sympathized with by all Asian nations. India hopes to strike a fatal blow to colonialism, and all Asian countries should do the same." The Delhi National Herald also stated: "If the United Nations cannot punish those who undermine peace and international agreements, the people of the world will lose their faith. Governments that fought against Nazism for six years should no longer deal with people who disagree with them in a Nazi way."

### British Government Pays Attention to Southeast Asian Situation. Strive to Prevent French Prestige from Being Affected. Colonial Wars Are Not Beneficial to Britain and France

[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] It has been learned that British Foreign Secretary Bevin will soon ask the British Cabinet to study the situation in Southeast Asia. The British Ambassador to France and Sir Killearn, the British Special Envoy to Southeast Asia, have both provided detailed reports to the government on the war in Vietnam. It is said that the situation in Southeast Asia may affect British interests, so Britain should do the following two things: (1) Britain is currently trying to promote friendly relations with Siam; (2) French prestige should not be affected.

[United Press, London, 27th] The Manchester Guardian commented on the situation in Vietnam today, stating, "Hardliners in Paris believe that France should never negotiate with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, but those with clear heads know that it is not a good strategy to maintain France's position in Vietnam and elsewhere by force alone. In the past, both France and Britain have engaged in colonial wars of plunder, and the result was that they themselves did not suffer serious losses. However, today, the general trend of the world has changed, and any colonial war in any part of Britain and France can shake its entire structure."

### French Government Takes a Firm Stance. Strive to Increase Reinforcements to Vietnam. Communists Urge Restoration of Peace Talks

[Agence France-Presse, Cherbourg, France, 27th] It has been learned that the French mail ship "Ile de France" is scheduled to transport 8,000 newly conscripted soldiers to Casablanca tomorrow, and then return to Toulon to transport French reinforcements to Vietnam.

[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 28th] Regularly scheduled air services within Vietnam have been temporarily suspended from today to facilitate the use of these aircraft to transport troops. However, those specially approved by the government may continue to fly as usual.

[Reuters, Paris, 27th] The French military authorities have been ordered by the government to urgently transfer reinforcements to Vietnam, and detailed information has always been kept secret. Paris said today that there has been no major change in the Viet Minh situation, and people here still believe that the French Colonial Department will not initiate negotiations with the leaders during its stay in Vietnam. However, some well-informed people believe that if there is an opportunity, they should make informal contact with them. The French government seems unwilling to negotiate with the Viet Minh until order is fully restored and the Viet Minh completely ceases military action. The French government will also firmly insist that any future Viet Minh government must have genuine representation before it is willing to negotiate with it. The French Communist Party does not agree with the government's shift to a tougher stance. The party's Politburo today passed a resolution strongly advocating for the prompt resumption of negotiations to achieve genuine cooperation between France and the Viet Minh. The French Foreign Ministry also disclosed two secret letters sent by Viet Minh President Ho Chi Minh to French Special Envoy Sendeny in Hanoi and French Military Commander Morlière on the afternoon and evening of December 19, requesting the French Commissioners to improve the situation based on the Paris resolutions, and informing Morlière that some of the French proposals would be considered by the Viet Minh cabinet the next day. When Morlière was proofreading the letter, the lights suddenly went out, as the Viet Minh army had sabotaged the power plant and launched an offensive.

### Initial Results of Investigation by French Colonial Minister

Believes Viet Minh Should Be Held Responsible for the Conflict

[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 27th] French Colonial Minister Garret led a delegation of the French government to Vietnam to investigate the French-Vietnamese conflict. He has been here for 48 hours since arriving and is now beginning to work actively. According to semi-official sources, Minister Garret's initial investigation has sufficiently proven that the current conflict should be held responsible by the Viet Minh government. The Viet Minh government has been organizing military institutions by taking advantage of the French-Vietnamese negotiations. The Viet Minh army's attack on the French army was carried out simultaneously in several places, which proves that this matter was planned in advance. The main clause of the French-Vietnamese Provisional Treaty stipulates that the French and Vietnamese sides should immediately cease the conflict, but the Viet Minh government has no intention of implementing the treaty. On the French side, they have always strived to reach an agreement with Vietnam. In addition, Vietnamese troops have already infiltrated the territory of Cochinchina, and although they have stopped fighting, they continue to ambush everywhere. These ambushes cannot be regarded as individual attempts. France has sent liaison delegations to contact the Viet Minh military authorities, but its members have been attacked by Viet Minh troops, resulting in injuries or deaths. This type of incident occurred in Haiphong. It is hoped that members of the Viet Minh government can break away from the control of extremists and restore their policy of agreement with France.

### Viet Minh Establishes Administrative Institutions in Haiphong. Welcomes Garret to Come and Negotiate

[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 27th] According to the Viet Minh government's underground newspaper: Viet Minh President Ho Chi Minh wrote that the Viet Minh government has established administrative institutions in Haiphong (between Hanoi and Haiphong). In addition, President Ho Chi Minh has also instructed his representatives stationed in Cochinchina to launch peaceful and solemn unarmed demonstrations to present the demands of the Vietnamese people to French Colonial Minister Garret, namely "Down with the puppet government of Cochinchina," "Recall General Li Xiangyi, the French High Commissioner in Vietnam," and "Welcome Minister Garret." This order was received in Saigon, so Zhu can follow it. A spokesman for the Viet Minh government also issued a broadcast statement stating that the Viet Minh Enemy Government welcomes Minister Garret to Vietnam and invites Minister Garret to come to Haiphong to hold consultations with President Ho Chi Minh.

### A Great Feat by a Norwegian Explorer: Crossing the Pacific Next Spring by Raft

[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] The U.S. Army Department announced: Norwegian explorer, Mr. Hjelda and four other Norwegians, will set sail on a raft from Ilo, Peru to Polynesia (Oceania) in February of next year. This 4,000-mile expedition aims to investigate the original inhabitants and culture of the Polynesian Islands. Mr. Hjelda's journey seeks to provide a basis for his theory that the original inhabitants of the Pacific traveled from America, not Asia. The raft carrying these explorers will drift on the ocean for four months and will be made of the lightest wood, built according to the ancient Peruvian wooden boat style. However, the raft will be equipped with radio and life-saving equipment. Mr. Hjelda said that the purpose of their trip is to test the feasibility of this voyage and to confirm whether Peruvian culture spread to the Central Pacific.

### American Warship Arrives in Marseilles

### Reopening Old Wounds: Churchill Actively Advocating for the Organization of the United States of Europe; Hopes for China to Become a First-Class Democracy

[United Press, New York, 28th] Collier's Magazine carries an essay by Churchill, reiterating his proposal for the organization of a European Federation and hoping that China will soon become a first-class democratic nation.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 27th] Former British Prime Minister Churchill published an article titled "Towards the Road to the Future" in "Collier's" magazine today, again advocating for the "organization of the United States of Europe." The article stated briefly: The division between communism and Christian doctrine, as well as Western culture, is fraught with fatal consequences unprecedented in human history. France must emit a signal of freedom in Europe, as there is no other way for France to restore its inherent true glory and its original position in the world. France must uplift the German people and lead them back into the international community. As the great French writer Victor Hugo appealed to the French National Assembly in Bordeaux in 1871, organizing the United States of Europe is a vision of the highest order. The Atlantic Ocean can no longer serve as a barrier for America, and European resentment may infiltrate America. Therefore, America must use its power to eliminate the germs of the infection center, and the organization of the United States of Europe is necessary for America's security.

Unless the United Nations organization has a strong organization within it, it will fail. Regarding the plan to organize the United States of Europe, I believe that Europe must abolish tariff barriers, establish economic coordination, and adopt a uniform currency system. Therefore, a regenerated Europe is not opposed to Russia or the Soviets, but the organization of the United States of Europe will be opposed by the Communist Party. The Communist Party must solve the problem of famine, as this is a necessary condition for the Communist Party to rule the world. In this current period of ideological conflict, the atomic bomb is a new balancing factor. Fortunately, the atomic bomb is currently owned by the United States, which can provide the world with a considerable period of peace, but the duration of that time is currently difficult to predict. In summary, if we want to succeed on the road to the future, it is necessary to restore life and unity in Europe and the Christian world.

### Talking About the Current Situation in a Withered Year

1946 is an extremely important year in modern history. The World War did end last year, but many of the difficult and complex issues it left behind need to be resolved this year, or at least a path to resolution needs to be opened. There is an ancient saying, "It is easy to share hardship, but difficult to share happiness." In fact, dealing with postwar problems is indeed more difficult than dealing with wartime problems. Conferences were held bustlingly throughout the year. Although the degree of achievement varied, there were some gains, such as the draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, which were already prepared for signing. Although the peace treaties with Japan and Germany have not yet been discussed, the days for formal discussion are not far off. Although the issue of atomic energy control remains a major tangle, the future seems a little clearer since the General Assembly passed the universal disarmament proposal. These factors are worth being optimistic about. However, if we believe that the world can be peaceful from now on, we cannot help but be rash and forceful. Because in the current world, there are indeed many inherent contradictions and conflicts, and even if the surface is temporarily easing, the day of fundamental resolution is still far away. In this withered year, we might as well chat about the current world situation.

The World is Even More Compact Today

According to the observations of the "World Report Weekly" correspondent, there are several obvious characteristics of the world situation in 1946: that is, the world today has become smaller and more compact. A few years ago, there were six or seven "powerful countries" in the world, which checked each other and maintained a balance of power, but today, there are only three, or at most five, countries with the power to influence the overall world situation. As for whether a balance of power can be created, it is still uncertain.

The Soviet Union is the second strongest country today. It has gathered several satellite countries and neighboring areas to form a compact political, economic, and military unit. The United States and the United Kingdom, ranked first and third, are very close in ideals, many common interests, and policies; they want to try to resist the expansionist policies of the Soviet world. Under these circumstances, the world is clearly divided into two major parts, with extremely large differences in concepts, political theories, and international actions. Although the United Nations organization has united more than fifty countries and assumed the responsibility of maintaining peace and security and promoting human progress, it is still difficult to exert its effectiveness in eliminating world boundaries for a while. In addition, the invention of the atomic bomb and other advancements in technology and science make it possible for the world situation to change at any time, and the world situation is therefore more complicated. Although everyone has the desire to solve the deadlock, they have no power to solve the deadlock.

The World Can Be Divided Into Four Regions

For the sake of explanation, we might as well divide the world into four regions: (1) a safe zone; (2) a disturbed zone; (3) a tense zone; and (4) a controlled zone. The so-called safe zone refers to places that are not directly involved in the disputes between the Soviet world and the Western world due to geographical circumstances. For example, after Australia's invading country, Japan, was defeated, it could relatively live in peace with the world and have its own world. The southern half of Africa and South America can also be classified into this category.

The disturbed zone refers to places that have special problems and cannot be stable. These problems are not unrelated to the world powers. The Soviet Union believes that these places are fertile ground for spreading communist seeds, and the Western countries believe that their preferential status there may be threatened. These places are always in danger of becoming tense areas, but they have not yet developed to this extent. India, Southeast Asia, and the Dutch East Indies can all be classified into this category.

The tense zone is where the policies and interests of the Soviet world and the Western world collide most directly, and there are the most disputes. The Middle East, Central Europe (including the free port areas), and other places belong to this category.

The controlled zone is the Soviet world and the Western world itself. Generally speaking, the Western world includes North America, northern South America, the United Kingdom, and Western Europe; the Soviet world starts from the Bering Sea in the east and extends to the Elbe River and the Adriatic Sea in the west.

Among these four types of regions, the safe zone and the disturbed zone are relatively secondary, and we might as well focus our attention on the controlled zone and the tense zone.

The Soviet Union Has Extremely Complete Territory

The Soviet world occupies one-fifth of the total land area, and the completeness of this land is unparalleled in the world. It may become the most self-sufficient part of the earth and is always led by a centralized power. From a defensive point of view, this part of the land occupies the strongest position; from an offensive point of view, the land and air forces occupy a great advantage. However, in terms of the navy, it has not been fully utilized due to geographical limitations.

From the perspective of the United Kingdom and the United States, the Soviet Union is still an undeveloped country, but it has the largest population among white countries, has the largest army in the world, has abundant resources, and its production is increasing day by day. The national character is tough and enduring, strictly controlled, has an expansive momentum in politics and ideology, and is confident that it will be able to manufacture atomic bombs in the near future.

The Western World Has Quite a Few Advantages

In terms of area, the Western world is equivalent to the Soviet world, but it is very different in terms of military factors. Geographically, it is separated by the Atlantic Ocean, while the Soviet world is a whole unit. The Western world's leadership is in the hands of the United Kingdom and the United States, and sometimes it is held separately by the United Kingdom and the United States. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States and between the United Kingdom and the United States and other Western countries is neither certain nor solid. From a military point of view, the shortcomings of the Western world compared with the Soviet world are that the organization is not sound enough and the command is not unified enough. In addition, the military position of Western countries is not as good as that of the Soviet world, because Western Europe and the United Kingdom are very vulnerable to attack and are not easy to defend. In addition to these two factors, the Western world almost surpasses the Soviet world in any aspect of military strategy. Moreover, the power of the atomic bomb is also a major military advantage currently held by the Western world.

The year is coming to an end. At the end of 1946, the world situation seems to be like this. As for whether the entanglements can be eliminated and whether the deadlock can be broken, it depends on the wisdom of the entire human race and to what extent it has evolved.

### General de Gaulle Declares Yesterday That He Does Not Intend to Participate in the Presidential Election; Speakers and Deputy Speakers of the French Senate Have Been Elected

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] General de Gaulle replied to a reporter's question at a press conference today: I am opposed to the current party politics, so I do not intend to participate in the presidential competition of the Fourth French Republic. The current party dictatorship cannot solve the serious domestic and foreign problems. I have already stated this point. The current constitution is to protect party power, so I dare not guarantee it. A president without real power cannot do anything. I believe that only those who think of the common good can save the French Republic.

[Reuters, Paris, 27th] General de Gaulle will soon make an important broadcast speech to the French people. Well-informed sources are unwilling to reveal the content of his speech, but they believe that he will mention his refusal to serve as president and the situation in Vietnam.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] After the Senate of the Fourth French Republic elected Mr. Le Ribeyre, a member of the People's Republican Party, as Speaker today, it immediately elected the Deputy Speakers, Treasurer, and Secretaries. Social Party member Mr. Pierre Brossolette, Mr. Monnerville of the Left-wing Republican Group, and Mr. Maurice Thorez, all three were elected as Deputy Speakers.

### Manufacturing Food from Air

Another New Idea from American Scientists

[United Press, Boston, 27th] Kettering, chief scientist of General Motors, announced at the Scientific Progress Association today that the world in the future may be able to use radiation chemistry to solve famine. Radiation chemistry is the use of nature to extract food that can be produced in the soil from carbon oxides, moisture in the air, and a few minerals. Currently, we do not know the method of extraction, but one day in the future, it may be made in the laboratory. Radiation chemistry can use a test tube, a gas lamp, or a measuring cup to make tens of billions of tons of carbon.

### Blum to Visit England to Discuss the German Issue

British Control of the Ruhr Industrial Zone

[Central News Agency, London, 27th] The London Evening News on the 27th reported that French Prime Minister Blum intends to visit London recently to hold important talks with Attlee and Bevin on the German issue.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] French Prime Minister Blum met with the U.S. Ambassador to France, Mr. Caffery, today for discussions, and afterwards also met with General Koenig, Commander-in-Chief of the French occupation forces in Germany.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] Well-informed sources recently stated that the British government will soon publish a memorandum on its views on the future of Germany. As soon as the four foreign ministers meet in London next January to discuss the German issue, the British government will send this memorandum to the four foreign ministers and propose that the industry in the Ruhr and Rhineland areas be placed under international joint control, so that Germany can restore economic unity.

### Yugoslav Troops Moved to the Greek Border; Greek Authorities Say the Situation in Northern Greece Has Improved

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 27th] According to reliable sources, Yugoslavia is currently moving all its troops stationed on the Hungarian border to the Greek border. Yugoslavia's actions are due to the United Nations Security Council's decision to send a fact-finding committee to northern Greece. According to a senior Greek government official, the purpose of Yugoslavia's troop movements is to avoid accidents during the investigation by the fact-finding committee. In addition, according to Mr. Rodopoulos, the chief administrator of northern Greece, the situation in northern Greece has improved since July. Currently, the bandits operating in northern Greece can be divided into three categories: (1) those whose leaders have adopted policies that oppose Greek ideals; (2) professional bandits who are filled with the spirit of robbery and crime; and (3) elements recruited from the people, who do not have any ideals, but only have a spirit of adventure and hatred for Greece. The first and second types of bandits have suffered heavy losses, and there are many who are surrendering. The third type of bandit is deeply afraid of having too many people, so they have stopped recruiting. The bodies of the fallen bandits are always carried back by other bandits, because they are afraid that if the family members of the dead find out, it will hinder the recruitment. As for the Greek government troops and the gendarmerie, they have good discipline, and the people from the villages who fled to other places have gradually returned to their hometowns.

### The State of East Indonesia Will Form a Coalition Cabinet, Recruiting Overseas Chinese to Participate

[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 28th] The newly elected President of the State of East Indonesia, Mr. Sukawati, declared at a press conference today that the new cabinet of the State of East Indonesia will recruit representatives from the Chinese, Dutch, and Indonesian sides to participate. The policy will first promote the cooperation of people from all levels, but this matter must be realized after quelling the transgressions caused by unstable elements. Sukawati went on to believe that Dutch New Guinea will be incorporated into the Indonesian Federation in the future, and will not become a piece of land in the State of East Indonesia.

### Four-Nation Investigation Team Can Enter the Soviet Zone of Germany

The Soviet Side Issued a Notice Yesterday

[United Press, Berlin, 27th] The Soviet side announced today that it is prepared to allow a four-nation investigation team to enter the Soviet occupation zone of Germany on January 6 next year to investigate the progress of clearing German military forces. This move proves that the demobilization of the Soviet occupying forces is nearing completion. According to the original plan, the four-nation investigation team was scheduled to enter the four occupation zones on November 25, but the Soviet Union requested a postponement, saying that the inspection of the Soviet military zone was difficult and there was still inconvenience. Later, there were repeated reports of a large-scale withdrawal of the Soviet occupying forces in Germany, but there were no official figures.

### Counterfeit Money Worth 300 Million Francs Discovered on the French Market

### The Public Prosecutor's Office Begins to Investigate the Responsibility for the Major Plane Crash; Three Public Prosecutors, Including Cao Hong, are Responsible for the Investigation; On-Site Inspections Will Be Conducted Tomorrow

[Reported by this newspaper] The city's Public Prosecutor's Office has been paying close attention to the major plane crash on Christmas Day, which killed or injured more than 80 passengers, and has been waiting for reports from all parties. However, as of yesterday, it had not received any reports from the airline or the police station at the scene of the accident. The Public Prosecutor's Office believes that the airline should bear legal responsibility for causing death due to negligence in its business operations. The chief prosecutor of the office, Huang Liang, specially instructed three public prosecutors, Cao Hong, Ji Su, and Wu Qihua, yesterday morning to be responsible for the investigation and prepare to initiate prosecution on their own initiative. After receiving the order, the three public prosecutors immediately assigned bailiffs to investigate the names, ages, birthplaces, and families of the victims at the scene of the accident and the locations of death, such as the Zhongshan Hospital, the Red Cross Hospital, the Sino-American Hospital, and funeral homes. At the same time, they inquired with the two police stations about the reasons for not immediately reporting to the court. According to Article 160 of the Criminal Procedure Law: "In the event of a death that is not due to illness or is suspected of not being due to illness, the competent public prosecutor shall quickly conduct an autopsy. If there is suspicion of a crime, he shall continue to conduct necessary inspections." Therefore, the public prosecutor has the right to order that the bodies of the deceased passengers be prevented from being collected. However, the Public Prosecutor's Office has great sympathy for the families of the deceased passengers and will not do so. The public prosecutor also heard rumors that after the accident that night, the rescue personnel at the scene first engaged in looting the personal belongings of the dead and injured passengers, delaying the rescue mission. It is extremely sinful to carry out robbery in the face of a catastrophe, and this will also be strictly investigated. At the same time, why the blind landing equipment at Jiangwan Airport could not be used temporarily, whether the night navigation equipment at the two airports was complete, and why the plane knew that the Shanghai climate was bad, but still had to land in Shanghai, etc., will all be the goals of the three public prosecutors' investigation. According to the three public prosecutors in charge, in order to fully exert the duties of a sound inspection system in a country ruled by law, the legal responsibilities for this tragedy will be pursued based on the spirit of judicial independence and a solemn position. Once the preliminary investigation is completed, the three public prosecutors will head to various places tomorrow to conduct on-site inspections in person.

### Two Bodies Injected with Preservatives, Awaiting the Last Farewell from Relatives

The bodies have been injected with preservatives. Most of the bodies of the victims of China No. 140, which were kept in the International Funeral Home, have also been coffined, and several have been transported back to their hometowns by their families for burial yesterday. Except for Zhu Xiangming, whose body was incomplete and other parts were still being searched for, the remaining bodies of the victims of the Central Airlines aircraft at the Central Funeral Home have all been coffined.

Yesterday morning, they continued to inspect the site of the Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) plane crash at Zhangjiazhai, Zhabei. Important responsible persons from the company accompanied them. The investigation of the case has now been completed, and the two returned to Nanjing last night to report on their mission.

### Xue Jianqiu's Trial Continued; Witness Bi Gaokui Absent

### Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury's American Edition Suspends Publication

[Special Dispatch from Central News Agency, New York, 27th] The American edition of the Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury will cease publication today after four years of publication. Mr. Randall Gould, the editor, said in a farewell message, "The war has been won, and transportation to the East has been restored. The role of the American edition of the Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury is over. Many people at the Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury and its readers feel the need to return home (Shanghai) and will do their best in the work of reconstruction and news reporting in Shanghai." The American edition of the newspaper was originally a product of wartime, published for people originally residing in the Far East. Because the newspaper could not be published in Shanghai during the occupation, the American edition was published to meet the public's expectations. At its peak, the newspaper had over 10,000 subscribers. Many China experts in the United States deeply regret the cessation of the newspaper's publication. According to Mr. Gould, the Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury will still maintain an office in New York to report various news to China experts.

### Mayor Hosts Senators to Exchange Opinions on City Budget, Majority Consider the Numbers Too Large to Accept

[Report from Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu hosted the speaker, vice speaker, and committee chairmen of the Municipal Senate at the Police Club at 7pm last night in an effort to discuss the municipal budget before the second assembly of the city senate convenes. A total of 70 people attended.

The mayor spoke first on the compilation of the budget and personnel restructuring policy, stating that the government has cut 900 personnel in succession to minimize administrative costs, but hired 1300, including teachers, tax collectors, and civil affairs staff. He acknowledged that the 230 billion yuan municipal budget might seem high, but compared it with the pre-war budget of 40 million yuan, asserting it isn't excessive relative to the current currency value. He stated that the budget was carefully considered and hoped that the senators can audit it, understand the difficulties, and pass it.

Following the mayor, the budget manager explained how the budget was composed. Director Gu of the Finance Bureau added that complaints on current tax collections were primarily targeted at municipal construction tax, the additional city tax. After repeated deliberation and consultation with citizens and senators, the municipal government determined to not double the tax during the winter, and reduce it by one third. These deductions apply to households that pay less than 100 yuan annually for rent, which will include 12000 households, and reduced tax will be applied to renters following a progressive rate. Those renting from 500, 1000, or 2000 annual yuan will be assessed between 50-80% of the original amount. Director Gu expressed his gratitude towards the senators for undergoing criticism from citizens over these tax matters.

Speaker Pan thanked the mayor, stating the excessive tax rate in the city has made life difficult for the senators and the city residents, but the city government is still in need of these funds to run the government, leaving the senators in a difficult position to approve this budget. He stated that on his way back to Shanghai from Nanjing, the criticisms from residents at the train station had alarmed him and made him anxious. He acknowledged the difficulties the city government is facing, and stated that senators should consider the well being of the residents as well as the operational needs of the city government.

The senators expressed that the size of the budget was difficult to accept, and requested that the city government reduce administrative headcount and reallocate these funds towards construction projects.

Finally, the mayor stated that he would accept the opinions of the senators and do his best. He also mentioned that he had originally planned to invite all senators to the reception, but had to limit it to only group leaders to save on costs.

### Mrs. Xiong Jiandong Received Foreign Medals, Wang Didi Met Relatives in Shanghai, Unclaimed Large and Small Corpses Finally Identified as His Father and Sister

[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] While many people in the world were celebrating Christmas night, China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Flight 115 crashed in the rain and fog near the Third Bridge on the Shanghai-Minhang Highway, in a pond to the right of Hetamiao. Of the forty-one people on board, thirty-four died and six were injured. Only the four-year-old "lucky boy" Wang Didi was unharmed. Don't you think this is a miracle? Look at the photo, what an adorable child!

In the past few days, because no family members had come to claim him, the CNAC temporarily fostered him at Zhongshan Hospital. At 2:45 p.m. yesterday, his maternal aunt, Ms. Tang Yijun, took him home.

Ms. Tang is Mrs. Xiong Jiandong, who is also Wang Didi's only relative in Shanghai. She saw the news in the newspaper, and the company also notified her, so she rushed to Zhongshan Hospital yesterday morning to visit her lucky nephew. Ms. Tang took out a photo of her younger brother and his wife and nephew to show Wang Didi, asking him, "Who are these people?" The intelligent Wang Didi replied one by one, "Uncle, Mommy, and cousin." They all lived together in Chongqing, so Wang Didi knew them all. However, he felt very unfamiliar with the aunt who came to take him home to raise him.

Ms. Tang Yizhang, Tang Yijun's younger sister, was from Guangxi, and her husband, Wang Genfa, was from Suzhou. They brought Wang Didi and Wang Didi's younger sister, a total of four people, from Chongqing to Shanghai. Now that the plane has crashed, Wang Didi is the only one left alive. Ms. Tang told reporters that she had never met Wang Genfa, so she only recognized the body of Wang Didi's mother, Tang Yizhang, at the funeral home. As for who his father and sister were, she had to take Wang Didi to identify them himself. However, because Wang Didi was not feeling well later, they did not go. There were only two unclaimed bodies, one large and one small, at the China Funeral Home. After investigation, it was confirmed that they were Wang Didi's father, Wang Genfa, and Wang Didi's younger sister, so they were both placed in coffins yesterday afternoon.

For the sake of caution, the CNAC asked Ms. Tang Yijun to write a guarantee and complete all the procedures. The four-year-old Wang Didi got into the No. 16334 car with his unfamiliar aunt and left Zhongshan Hospital to live with his aunt on Yuyuan Road. There, he will have many cousins to accompany him and will no longer feel lonely!

At the hospital, a nurse asked the four-year-old child, "What is your father's name?" He replied, "Wang Dad." "Where is Dad?" "In Chongqing." "What about Mommy?" He pouted and shook his head, without answering. This poor child does not know that he has lost his father, his mother, and his sister forever. He does not know that he has experienced a great disaster, nor does he know that he is the only lucky one. He is only four years old. May he grow up happily and no longer have these bloody stories in his mind! Many people are saying, "A narrow escape from death is sure to bring future blessings." May God bless this "little angel" who encountered disaster and was rescued on Christmas night and make him happy forever!

### Senate Suggests Improving the Economy, Executive Yuan Replies with Six Points of Explanation

[Report from Our Newspaper] The City Senate previously decided at the first conference to send a delegation of eleven people, including Deputy Speaker Xu, to Nanjing to petition for improved economic policies. The Executive Yuan has now replied by telegram, stating:

Assisting Production Has Been Considered

"The telegram and attachments have been received. The original suggestions regarding various financial and economic measures, including 1. Adjusting banking operations, 2. Adjusting agricultural, industrial, and commercial funds, 3. Developing international trade, and 4. Invigorating local land finance, have been directly reviewed and replied to by the Ministry of Finance. Recently, in order to assist the development of production industries, resolve the economic crisis, and promote economic recovery, the Executive Yuan specially convened a meeting of financial and industrial and commercial sectors in Shanghai to discuss the direction. Matters related to production loan interest rates and procedures, as well as the supply of machinery, raw materials, and other items needed for normal production industries, have all been considered.

Factory Losses Summarized for Claims

5. Compensation for war losses: The losses suffered by factories during the war should be reported to the Compensation Committee in accordance with regulations, and compensation will be claimed from Japan in the future. Priority purchase of enemy and puppet factories by rear-area restored factories has been established and announced for implementation. If rear-area restored factories have needs, they can apply to the competent authorities in accordance with regulations. In addition, the income from the disposal of enemy and puppet materials and property should be fully handed over to the national treasury in accordance with regulations. If local governments hold education, culture, charity, and economic construction projects, they should apply for the use of enemy and puppet properties within their jurisdiction in accordance with the "Measures for Local Governments to Allocate and Receive Enemy and Puppet Properties."

Fuel Control a Measure of Expediency

6. Abolishing coal rationing: At the beginning of recovery, most of the major mining areas were destroyed, and coal reserves were extremely low, with insufficient production. The government adopted rationing measures to support production and assist in solving the difficulties of public utilities, railways, ships, and various industrial coal uses in the Southeast provinces. However, white coal briquettes and coke used for cooking and heating by urban residents are not subject to rationing, and merchants can sell them freely. This rationing measure is a temporary expedient. Once production and transportation conditions improve, the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee will be dismantled. Let it be known."

### Second Assembly: Registration Begins

[Report from Our Newspaper] The City Senate's second assembly began yesterday with the registration of fifty-four senators. In order to make the proceedings of the meeting as clear as possible to the public, if citizens request to attend, they must be introduced by a senator or approved by the council.

### Silk Weaving Industry's Year-End Bonus Issue: Difference Between Seven Days and One Month; Society Hopes Labor Will Make Concessions

[Report from Our Newspaper] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, issued a statement on the year-end bonus issue in the silk weaving industry, saying, "More than 15% of the silk weaving industry is in a very precarious situation. Those who are barely maintaining are hoping to overcome the current difficulties by means of production loans. After the labor side made its demand for a year-end bonus, the Bureau of Social Affairs mediated three times. Currently, the capital side has agreed to seven days, while the labor side insists that it must be one month. However, a seven-day year-end bonus would require the silk weaving industry to pay out 1.4 billion yuan, and a one-month demand is in fact impossible to bear. I deeply hope that the labor side can realize the folly of 'killing the chicken to get the egg' and accept the seven-day number. Otherwise, the Bureau of Social Affairs will make a ruling when necessary."

### Labor-Capital Dispute in the Hospitality Industry: Judgment Committee Has Ruled

Director Wu also announced that the labor-capital dispute in the hotel industry has been ruled by the Labor-Capital Dispute Judgment Committee as follows: (1) Salary part: Adopt the "base salary discount system." Eighty percent of the worker's salary is for the employee's livelihood guarantee and must be paid monthly regardless of business conditions. The remaining 40% is used to calculate employee salaries based on the hotel's business performance. (2) Severance pay: Refer to the Judgment Committee's method for factories to dismiss workers, and determine the amount of severance pay based on the length of service, with a maximum of no more than three months. (3) Guarantee money refund issue: According to Article 6 of the record of inquiry made by the Police Bureau on January 24 of this year, when a worker is dismissed, the guarantee money will be refunded in its original total amount, and a bonus of one to two months will be issued. Another dispatch: The Bureau of Social Affairs currently stipulates that if either party's representative fails to attend three times after the bureau convenes mediation for a labor-capital dispute, a ruling will be made in absentia. However, this does not apply to cases where the summons cannot be delivered.

### Hualian Ship Sets Sail Today: Carrying Jewish Emigrants Back to Australia

Except for the original cargo transiting through Hong Kong to Tianjin, no cargo or passengers from this city will be carried.

### Two Cases of Men and Women Taking Poison

[Report from Our Newspaper] At 11:00 p.m. last night, Yan Aifeng, a 25-year-old young woman, took poison in Room 7, Rongxiang Lane, Yanjia Pavilion, Xibaoxing Road. Fortunately, she was discovered and taken to Gongji Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the reason for the suicide was that her husband's speculation failed, and a quarrel broke out between the couple. In addition, a man named Huang Guimin at No. 278, Beisichuan Road also committed suicide by swallowing gold due to economic pressure.

### East Asia One Floor Resumes Business: Labor-Capital Dispute Being Mediated

[Report from Our Newspaper] The labor-capital dispute at Dongya Yilou (East Asia One Floor) in the Zhabei district, which started some time ago, has been resolved under the mediation of the Bureau of Social Affairs, with incremental progress being made. At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, the capital side handed over the keys to the main door to the labor representatives, accompanied by personnel dispatched from the Police Bureau, and the door was opened, temporarily allowing workers to enter for food and lodging. The labor representatives also reported the reasons for the shutdown and the process to the press yesterday. Currently, the employees have put forward four demands: (1) Resume work as soon as possible; (2) Pay the salaries and bonuses for November and December and all public accumulation funds; (3) Open the main door of the restaurant; (4) Provide food and wages before resuming work. It is reported that the Bureau of Social Affairs has promised to convene both parties for consultation again tomorrow.

### Tax Reform Better Than Tax Increase: Senators' Opinions on the Municipal Budget; Believe the City is No Longer Obligated to Provide Labor Services

The Municipal Government's budget for the 36th year of the Republic, as a result of the review and compilation by various bureaus and departments, has reached more than 230 billion yuan in expenditures. In order to balance revenue and expenditure shortfalls, the Municipal Government has included the municipal construction surcharge on house rent tax and the municipal surcharge on public utility fees into the temporary revenue item in accordance with the autumn tax rate of the 35th year. In addition, a new obligation labor substitute fee of 40 billion yuan has been added under the revenue item, totaling more than 86.8 billion yuan. The budget has already been sent to the Senate. This reporter specially interviewed various senators to solicit their opinions on this budget. The senators almost unanimously expressed that they dare not simply ask about setting up temporary revenue to make up for the insufficient tax revenue. During the first assembly of this Senate, it was agreed that the temporary increase in municipal construction fees and public utility fees would be limited to this year, and they did not approve the extension to the next year's budget. Moreover, the obligation labor substitute fee has been added to the new budget for next year, which is even more inappropriate. Furthermore, the Constitution recently passed by the National Assembly stipulates that the people have the obligation to perform military service, but not the obligation to perform labor service, so this tax cannot be established. They also said that tax reform is better than tax increase. They hope that the Municipal Government will reduce new taxes and strive to reorganize the original tax revenue to increase the tax amount. From this point of view, this issue will become a major issue for heated discussion at the second assembly of the Senate.

### Motorcycle Patrol Encountered an Ambush at Night: Both Sides Opened Fire on Lincoln Road; A Large Group of Police Officers Encircled and Searched

[Report from Our Newspaper] In the jurisdiction of the Shangxinjing Sub-bureau in the western suburbs of Shanghai, bandits often appear at night. The Municipal Police Bureau specially instructed the sub-bureau chief, Zhang Zhen, to send more patrols to work day and night, and to rotate the motorcycle patrols. At about 8:00 p.m. last night, a motorcycle patrol team of more than ten people patrolled to a place about 100 yards west of the Lincoln Road Watchtower of the Zhoujiaqiao Outpost of the Shangxinjing Sub-bureau. More than ten bandits ambushed in the ditches on both sides, drew their guns, and fired seven or eight shots. At that time, the motorcycle patrol police officers quickly dismounted and returned fire, firing more than ten shots. Bullets flew everywhere. Two horses were shot and injured, and police officer Si Zhengxiao (24 years old, from Zhuji), No. 5588, and police officer Jiang Qi (24 years old, from Anhui), No. 4621, were injured in the fall and were later sent to the police hospital for treatment. Afterwards, the bandits even dared to enter the Xinsheng Ranch at No. 250 on the same road, intending to rob it. Fortunately, the ranch called the watchtower to report it. Patrol Leader Li led a number of police officers to rush there and reported to the Shangxinjing Sub-bureau and the General Bureau. Before long, the Criminal Police Department of the General Bureau ordered all police officers on duty to take several police vehicles, and the motorcycle team, the Deputy Team Leader of the Justice Police Criminal Police Brigade, Zheng Youchen, led the team leader Zhang Tianan and six team members. The Shangxinjing Sub-bureau and the Changning Police Bureau also dispatched a large number of police officers. The chief of the Criminal Department, Zhang Shi, and the sub-bureau chief, Hong Zhen, arrived one after another and guarded the key points. Police officers stood guard every three steps and patrolled every five steps. From the south of Lincoln Road to the north of Hongqiao Road, west of Zhongshan Road to the east of Gubei Road, a tight encirclement of about three miles was made. Another group of police officers was dispatched to search house by house in each village to prevent the bandits from escaping. As of 1:30 a.m. this morning, the search was still in progress. According to Sub-bureau Chief Zhang, the bandits were led by one with a pockmarked face and one with a hunchback, with more than twenty followers, equipped with long and short military weapons, harassing Hongqiao, Shangxinjing, and other places for half a month, which is very hateful, so they must be wiped out.

### Domestic Goods Exhibition Market: Shops Temporarily Closed

The Domestic Goods Exhibition Market temporarily closed yesterday because the Xincheng Police Bureau sent personnel to the Shanghai Velvet Company at the market to seize goods, causing a misunderstanding among all participating manufacturers. After the two sides explained, except for the part of the Shanghai Machine Line Company that was waiting for legal processing, the manufacturers immediately resumed business as usual.

### Vehicle River Crossing: Planning a Ferry Service to Facilitate Cargo Transport in Pudong; Pier Locations Have Been Selected

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Ferry Company, recognizing that the material collection points in the city are concentrated, and the cargo depots in Puxi are no longer sufficient to accommodate them, while the cargo depots in Pudong are underutilized due to transportation issues, is preparing a vehicle ferry service to cross the Huangpu River. It is reported that locations have been selected on both sides of the river, with the Puxi side being the Lujiabang Branch Road and the Pudong side being the Liangmatou Road.

According to Mr. Lu Binhou, an engineer from the company, who spoke to our reporter, the selected locations are not the most ideal, but rather the ones where land issues on both sides are the simplest and easiest to resolve. The shoreline of the piers on both sides is approximately 80 meters long, and the piers and ships will be parallel to the shoreline. Vehicles will cross via fixed approach bridges and movable drawbridges, disembarking from the bow or stern of the ship. This top-level ferry station design has been finalized after research by engineering experts, based on the principles of economy, convenience, and safety.

Regarding land transportation on both sides, Puxi does not pose a problem. However, Pudong can only勉强通達大道, so the company hopes that the municipal authorities can construct a new road in the future.

As for the transport vessels, the company plans to request the purchase of two landing crafts from the Bureau of Materials Supply. Each vessel can carry approximately ten vehicles at a time, with a daily capacity of 700 to 800 vehicles. It is expected to be completed by March or April of next year.

In addition to this line, the company also plans to open a second ferry line in the Hongkou area, with the Puxi location being Guanzhou Road and the Pudong location being Xidu.

[Another Report] The Shanghai Ferry Company will build a modern passenger ferry station south of the Waterfront Hotel on Zhongshan East Road. It will have two levels with facilities such as telegraph, telephone, postal services, travel agencies, and restaurants. A similar ferry station is also planned for Luqiuqu Road in Pudong.

### Cigarette Factories Jointly Request the Prevention of Work Slowdowns

[Report from Our Newspaper] Representatives of the employers of more than 20 cigarette factories in the city went to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday at 6 p.m. to petition for the prevention of work slowdowns by workers. According to one representative who spoke to our reporter, the year-end bonus in the cigarette industry, as approved by the Bureau, is one month's salary for long-term workers and 8% of the total annual income for piece-rate and temporary workers. However, the workers' demands range from two to three months to four to five months, with no standard. Because the factories are unwilling to accept this, they have been slowing down their work, with daily production only about one-tenth of the usual, resulting in significant losses. Therefore, they have collectively petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau to take effective measures to prevent this. In addition, the issue of year-end bonuses must be resolved by all factories together; individual compromises are not a good solution.

### Local News Briefs

### Enemy Military Police Officer Mimura Haruki Sought Promotion Through False Accusations, Resulting in a Major Injustice; Entire Case Details Now Clear; Verdict Expected Tomorrow; Military Tribunal Reopened Trial Yesterday; Victims' Families Recount Experiences; "The Wolf of Changshu" Cannot Escape Death

[Report from Our Newspaper] "The Wolf of Changshu," enemy military police officer Mimura Haruki, was tried by Judge Lu Qi of the First Pacification District Military Tribunal yesterday morning, ending after 1 p.m. The case is now nearing its conclusion, with a joint session scheduled for tomorrow afternoon at 1 p.m. to review the case before a verdict can be reached. The event will be filmed by the Central Film Studio.

Mimura Haruki was the captain of the enemy military police unit in Changshu, and his misdeeds were notorious throughout the countryside during his tenure. In 1943, Mimura, seeking promotion and reward, instigated a major injustice, indiscriminately arresting over 6,000 local residents in the Changshu and Taicang areas. Some were later released, but the fate of over 3,000 remains unknown. After the victory, Mimura was arrested by the authorities and subjected to repeated trials by the military tribunal. The accused made cunning excuses and attempted to shift blame, claiming that 27 of the detainees were sent to the Shanghai Military Law Conference and five others were sent to the local county hospital. To verify these claims, the military tribunal dispatched investigators to Changshu to gather detailed information and exhume the remains of the victims, confirming that Mimura's statements were entirely false. Therefore, the court reopened the trial yesterday.

### Ruddy Complexion, Natural Demeanor

Yesterday, Mimura wore a草綠military uniform and a草綠overcoat, appearing quite proper. He carried a military water bottle and had a ruddy complexion and natural demeanor. It was hard to believe he was a prisoner awaiting execution, and one might even suspect that his prison life was still quite comfortable. His face showed no signs of savagery, but he appeared extremely cunning. Judge Lu first summoned the victims' families, Lu Dashou, Wang Xuejun, Chen Jinhua, Huang Jue, and Zheng Peiyun's wife, from Yu Tai in Shanghai to testify. After a brief questioning, he sternly questioned Mimura based on the statements made by a doctor, nurse, administrator, and a former translator surnamed Lu who had worked at the county hospital in Changshu. The key points can be summarized as follows:

### Questioning Atrocities, Summarized in Four Points

(1) Mimura denied ever committing atrocities. However, individuals who worked at the former county hospital testified that patients sent to the hospital by the military police were generally injured and had difficulty walking.

(2) Mimura claimed that Ye Zhenfei and four others died after being sent to the hospital due to illness and that their bodies were claimed by their families. However, in reality, whether patients sent to the hospital by the military police died or recovered, they were either buried or retrieved by the military police.

(3) The reason Mimura instigated the major injustice was to seek promotion and reward. Therefore, he first demolished the Yang family's house next to the military police station and built four prison cells. The person who suggested this was a translator surnamed Wang. After the victory, the translator, knowing his crimes were heinous, pleaded with Mimura, who provided him with money and a car to escape.

(4) Chen Yunzhou, the administrator of the county hospital, testified that after the large-scale arrests, many injured patients were sent to the hospital. Those who died were secretly transported by the enemy military police to be buried outside the North Gate at midnight, and onlookers were prohibited. He also witnessed two people surnamed Gu and Sang die from their injuries.

### Four Skeletons Brought to Court

Mimura continued to be evasive about the above points, either denying them or claiming that they were the actions of his subordinates. However, Judge Lu calmly stated the facts, leaving the accused with no room for further evasion.

Four skeletons of victims, exhumed from Changshu and brought back by Li Yechu, the former chief clerk of the tribunal, were placed in the corner of the courtroom but were not shown to Mimura.

It is reported that Mimura's case will be judged on charges of murder under military law and abuse of power, and he will likely not escape death.

### Indictment After Completion of Investigation on Two Criminals, Kurozawa Tsuguo and Others

[Report from Our Newspaper] The First Pacification District Military Tribunal has completed its investigation of Japanese war criminals Kurozawa Tsuguo and Kawazoe Nagatsugu and has initiated a public prosecution.

Kurozawa Tsuguo was a graduate of the Faculty of Law at Waseda University in Tokyo. He was the leader of the Pacification Work Team of the Japanese 22nd Division. The Pacification Office was responsible for intelligence work and was organized by Kurozawa Tsuguo starting in August 1940. It was established on November 3 of the same year and was stationed in the suburbs of Hangzhou, possessing over 500 rifles and machine guns. The team began killing five people in the month after its establishment, and then killed people one or two times a month, totaling more than 120 people, including local residents, our 保長, returning soldiers, and military and political personnel. Some were even buried alive, and Kurozawa personally shot more than ten people with a machine gun. Su Ronghe, the former acting magistrate of Hangzhou, was also arrested by them in July 1941 and taken to Genshan Gate, but was later released. However, he witnessed dozens of our captured soldiers at the scene, and Kurozawa's troops had shovels and other burial tools. After the victory, the criminal hid in the Hangzhou Japanese Resident Management Office and was arrested by the Zhejiang Higher Court Procuratorate and sent to the military tribunal.

Kawazoe Nagatsugu was the captain of the Shanghai West Military Police Unit. On May 1, 1945, he lured and arrested Chen Fengxiang, the intelligence leader of the 33rd Branch of our city party headquarters, and used sticks, water torture, kneeling on iron cans, and other forms of torture to force a confession, causing Chen's leg to be injured and never fully healed. On May 6 of the same year, he arrested a civilian, Xin Zhihong, and falsely accused him of being the author of anti-Japanese plays. He subjected him to water torture, and because Xin resisted by holding his breath, the criminal placed burning cigarettes on Xin's abdomen to prevent him from holding his breath, resulting in numerous scars. After the victory, he hid in a concentration camp and was identified by members of the 蒙難同志會.

### Auhad Bureau Espionage Case; Niemann-Hasser Tried Yesterday

[Report from Our Newspaper] Niemann, an assistant to the Guangzhou branch of the Auhad Bureau, testified in US military court yesterday that he continued to work after Germany's surrender until August 11, 1945, when he learned that Japan had accepted the Potsdam Declaration. However, at that time, the Japanese side still intended to have them continue working, so two "seam telegraphers" continued to work for two more weeks. When Germany surrendered, his superior, Hasser, instructed him not to resign and paid him twice.

Hasser, formerly in charge of the Chongqing branch of the Guangzhou branch, also testified in court yesterday. He deflected responsibility, claiming that the Auhad Bureau headquarters did not issue any orders to dissolve the Guangzhou branch when Germany surrendered. As for the funds remitted by headquarters, he believed they were used to pay staff salaries.

### Unified Calculation of Cotton Yarn Production Costs; Five Accounting Subjects Determined; Each Factory to Calculate Separately and Submit to the Textile Control Commission

[Our Report] At a recent meeting, the Textile Control Commission (紡管會) decided to set new prices for cotton yarn purchases based on current production costs. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, representatives from the accounting, finance, and statistics departments of various National and private yarn factories gathered in the conference room of the Textile Construction Company on Jiangxi Road to discuss the accounting subjects for calculating production costs. Vice Chairman Li and Director Liu Wenteng of the Textile Control Commission also attended. The meeting adjourned around 1:00 PM. It was decided to unify the accounting subjects for calculating the production costs of military cotton yarn into five major categories: 1. Raw materials, 2. Wages, 3. Manufacturing expenses, 4. Financial expenses, and 5. Business expenses. Manufacturing expenses are further divided into items such as materials, depreciation, employee benefits, power, and repairs. National and private yarn factories will separately calculate their respective production costs based on these unified items, to be submitted for approval at a meeting of the Textile Control Commission.

### Reproduction Industry Unanimously Hopes That Cotton Yarn Supply Will Be Regular

The fourth round of the fourth batch of yarn allocation has been delayed for a week, still without definite news due to the need to renegotiate prices. According to Mr. Pan Shihao, the person in charge of the Reproduction Allocation Committee, a regular supply of cotton yarn is the sincere hope of all reproduction industries. However, occasional delays and price renegotiations are not considered serious problems. Regarding the new cotton yarn control measures recently decided by the Textile Control Commission, Mr. Yi (溢氏) stated that this is a universal issue concerning society and the people's livelihood, and not merely a matter between the government and yarn factory owners. On the surface, the new measures seem to be a compromise between the two parties. Regarding the future supply of cotton yarn and the rise and fall of yarn prices, it is believed that the Textile Control Commission will give serious consideration to society and the people's livelihood. Mr. Pan also pointed out that since September, yarn control policies have been changed three times, and the new measures may still be experimental. Furthermore, the detailed procedures for how the Textile Control Commission will handle the cotton yarn purchased from yarn factories, and how yarn factory owners will supply the retained portion, still need to be discussed. In this regard, the reproduction industry wishes to reiterate its advocacy for a regular supply of cotton yarn. He revealed yesterday that the Reproduction Allocation Committee had previously submitted a written opinion to the Textile Control Commission, advocating that half of the yarn used by the reproduction industry should be allocated regularly on a fixed basis, and half should be allocated flexibly on a temporary basis, so that both supply and demand sides can operate in an orderly manner, to prevent monopolists from disrupting the market and speculators from running rampant. As for the possibility of exporting cotton yarn to earn foreign exchange, the Reproduction Allocation Committee advocates that the reproduction industry should be allowed to receive yarn for processing and export the finished products to Southeast Asia.

### Yarn Market Firm

The yarn market continued to stabilize yesterday. Although customer demand has not improved, market sentiment has become firm. 20-count and 16-count yarns of various brands continued to rise by 10,000 to 40,000 yuan. 32-count fine yarn, due to limited arrivals from Qingdao and Tianjin, was eagerly sought by Cantonese merchants, and its price soared. For example, 32-count Five Color Star (五彩星) yarn jumped from 2.7 million yuan yesterday to 2.82 million yuan, with limited supply. 42-count yarn was also popular, following the trend with an increase of about 100,000 yuan.

### Public Bonds Dull

The public bond market was dull yesterday, with mixed bonds slightly recovering. Unified Type C bonds remained stable, opening at 1,380 yuan in the morning. With purchases from Chengtong (誠德) and Room 503, the price rose to around 1,490 yuan. The result was a slight increase of 20 yuan compared to the previous close. Types A and B bonds fell by 50 yuan, and Unified Types D and E bonds fell by 20 yuan. Total trading volume was 4 million yuan.

### Shanghai Branch of the Cooperative Bank to Open on the Sixth of Next Month

All times for submitting and returning bills will also be delayed by two hours according to the current time ratio.

### Taiwan Sugar Initially Weak, Then Firm

The Taiwan sugar market initially weakened yesterday, then firmed. The association's clearing price for the spot market was 137,500 yuan for medium-grade white sugar and 127,000 yuan for raw red sugar in the morning. By the afternoon, the company's previous sugar payments were allowed to be flexible, so the trend turned positive. The clearing price for medium-grade white sugar rose to 145,000 yuan, and raw red sugar rose to 135,000 yuan, an increase of about 8,000 yuan. However, green sugar remained soft. Shantou green sugar opened at 110,000 yuan to 108,000 yuan, Runde green sugar was quoted at 108,000 yuan, and finally settled at 105,400 yuan, a decrease of 5,000 to 6,000 yuan.

They will be established separately within days.

### Defaults Affect Tea Market

The foreign-owned tea market, which mainly sells Chenzhu tea to Africa, saw limited transactions at local tea companies due to scarce supply. The sales of other varieties, such as Chuzhen and Zhenmei, also proved difficult. The overall trend for other teas was similar to the previous day.

Amidst this sluggish tea market, some established businesses are suffering from the pressure of "high-interest loans," finding it difficult to bear. Not long ago, over forty tea firms in Hangzhou were attacked by this trend and went bankrupt. At the same time, it is reported that many firms in Suzhou and Tianjin also went bankrupt. Recently, it has been learned that this trend has gradually spread to this city. Several firms have already closed down in the past few days. If this trend is allowed to continue unchecked, the number of firms following suit may increase.

### Limited Transactions in Woolen Fabrics

Transactions in woolen fabrics were limited at tea parties and wholesale shops on Qipan Street yesterday. Due to the approaching end of the year, tight credit, and the prevalence of defaults, coupled with other environmental factors, all transactions required cash. At the same time, actual sales have reached their tail end, the public's purchasing power has sharply decreased, and the black market interest rates are getting higher and higher. Most stores with some financial strength are willing to temporarily suspend business for a few days and wait for the end of the year. Therefore, the prices of various goods are trending downward. Spring tweed is the most promising, while overcoat fabrics continue to decline. Melton fabrics, which had previously risen due to delays in licenses and customs procedures, saw a large number of arrivals yesterday, and the standard price has fallen from 42,000 yuan to 39,000 yuan.

### Gold Prices Unstable; US Dollar Slightly Weaker

Spot gold continued to weaken yesterday, and buyers remained unable to rally. The price trended downward towards the close. It opened at 3.28 million in the morning, and the situation was unstable after the opening. Demand and supply fluctuated, and operators widened the buying and selling prices. It rose and fell suddenly, first rising to 3.34 million, with slight pressure. Around 10:00 AM, it fell to 3.25 million, and the Central Bank allocated gold at this price to four-one bars. After the supply was slightly reduced, buying interest rose again, and the price rose as high as 3.44 million. After pressure from the Central Bank, it was still difficult to move forward. Therefore, retail buyers were forced to settle due to tight credit, and the price fell to around 3.3 million at noon. In the afternoon, it fell as low as 3.21 million, then stabilized slightly. Finally, it was between 3.28 million and 3.3 million, a slight increase of 10,000 yuan compared to the previous close. Holiday gold was 350,000 yuan. Silver dollars rose again, and black market interest rates remained between 15% and 18%.

Foreign currencies were not active yesterday. The black market price of the US dollar initially rose to 6,600 yuan around 6,400 yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, the gold market crashed, and the price was reported as low as 6,000 yuan to 6,200 yuan. Finally, it was sold at 6,300 yuan, a decrease of about 200 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong dollar was sluggish, and the result was similar to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 1,230 yuan for sale, but the transaction volume was still small. The Indian exchange rate was 1,500 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 19,800 yuan, but there were no buyers. The US exchange rate remained sluggish.

### Banks Should Reduce Accepting Sealed Banknotes as Much as Possible; Customers Should Seal Banknotes; Responsible Persons of the Banking Association Issue Statements

According to responsible persons of the Banking and Commercial Association, the Association recently, in view of the large number of banknotes being exchanged in the market, often with tens of millions of yuan being transferred in and out of a single account, found that it was impossible for both parties to check the numbers. Therefore, the sealing method was adopted. However, if these banknotes are sent to the Central Bank, the remitting bank must reseal them, and the remitting bank is responsible for any shortages in the future. In theory, the remitting bank can seek compensation from the previous party, and the responsibility seems clear and undeniable. However, recent facts have revealed many malpractices. First, due to the long period of accumulation, counting is difficult. Second, after repeated transfers, it is difficult to investigate who is ultimately responsible, and each party has its own version, making it impossible to judge. Therefore, disputes of this kind between customers and banks are endless. Cunning individuals even use various methods to take advantage of the situation, resulting in shortages of up to hundreds of thousands of yuan in sealed banknotes. If this continues, it will inevitably lead to mutual entanglement and an irreparable situation. The sealing method was originally a temporary expedient to cope with the squeeze. Now that malpractices have arisen, it is urgent to improve it. In terms of fundamental solutions, it is necessary to promote the circulation of negotiable instruments and reduce the exchange of currency. In terms of immediate solutions, each bank should first reduce accepting sealed banknotes from customers as much as possible. Except for those who are particularly trustworthy, counting must be done at any time, regardless of the difficulty of manpower and resources, and should not be delayed for too long, in order to clarify the responsibility of each party. At the same time, the Association has sent a letter to the Central Bank, requesting that it check the original sealed banknotes of each bank stored in the Bank as soon as possible, so as to avoid future difficulties in tracing and losses.

### Raw Materials Market: Year-End Market Closure; Several Ups and Downs This Year; Considerable Profits at the End of the Year

Trading in the raw materials market has become sparse since yesterday. As the end of the year approaches, both buyers and sellers are busy with year-end settlements, so the market has suddenly become deserted. Transactions in trading houses and stores have also trended toward a closed state. Looking back on the raw materials business this year, the business of general trading houses was quite prosperous from January to April, and profits were quite considerable. Newly established trading houses sprang up like mushrooms after rain, mostly engaged in ordering goods. After May, orders poured in, and the raw materials trading houses trended downhill. At this time, raw material importers faced many difficulties, such as the uncertainty of when ordered goods would arrive, and the unbearable interest on loans. When the ordered goods arrived, they rushed to sell them, and the prices were lower than the ordered value abroad. In addition, manufacturers also directly ordered the goods that the trading houses had, so they could not sell them. Furthermore, due to traffic obstructions and industrial stagnation in other ports, raw materials were clogged in a corner of Shanghai, and prices depreciated again and again. Almost all of the century-old trading houses were on the verge of collapse, let alone the newly established trading houses. Only companies with strong financial strength let their goods pile up like mountains and waited quietly for the opportunity. However, most of those operating on loans had their funds frozen in foreign orders and could not turn them over. They had to sell all the popular goods at a discount to repay their debts. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the raw materials trading houses saw a turnaround again. At this time, most factories in the city increased production and resumed work, and orders had not arrived for a long time due to the US maritime workers' strike. Raw material prices slowly rose. By late November, industrial raw materials, regardless of popular or unpopular goods, were very profitable. The price of popular goods soared, and the value of unpopular goods also increased tenfold. Therefore, the raw materials business this year can safely pass the year-end, especially the profits earned in November and December, which were quite substantial.

### Crackdown on Speculation Gradually Taking Effect; Authorities' Supervision Becoming More Active

According to a financial authority interviewed by the reporter, the unstable situation caused by speculation in recent days has gradually passed after strict crackdown by the relevant authorities. The bill clearing situation yesterday was quite good. The clearing time was earlier than the previous two days, and there were not many returned bills. From this, it can be hoped that the end of the year can be safely passed. As for the gold shops engaged in speculation in the black market, in addition to Yongxing Gold Shop, which was sealed by the municipal government on the orders of the Ministry of Finance yesterday, the management of the remaining gold shops is stricter than before, so that speculators cannot hide in them. In addition to strengthening management by the financial authorities in charge, the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank is also exercising its strict supervisory responsibility. It is expected that the turmoil of speculation will soon be quelled.

### Tight Credit; High Black Market Interest Rates; Hua Shares' Swap Trading Active

Hua shares were erratic yesterday. Trading in the market was purely dominated by swaps. Initially, the financial community did not make any moves, so the swap spread was very large. Yong Yarn reached over 35 yuan, Xinyi (信和) reached over 15 yuan, and the aggregate interest rate reached over 25%. Later, Xinhua and Ye (業) and others came to maintain the market, and the situation began to stabilize slightly. The morning opening was low. Numbers 224 and 229 bought spot Yong Yarn, and numbers 85, 91, and 198 bought forward delivery, gradually rising to over 625 yuan. Numbers 155, 89, and 61 sold spot Yong Yarn, and numbers 70, 4, and 229 sold forward Yong Yarn. Then, after 10:00 AM, the price fell to 604 yuan. Number 89 took advantage of the low price to cover, and numbers 180, 22, 185, 224, and 14 all bought. The gold market was bullish, forward Yong Yarn rose to 648 yuan, and spot Yong Yarn rose to over 611 yuan. Number 99 vigorously sold spot Yong Yarn, and numbers 218, 215, 185, 172, and 145 successively sold. The gold price also fell back. Near noon, spot Yong Yarn fell below 585 yuan, but because numbers 233 and 89 and others covered, it was still able to rebound at noon. The result was a slight increase for Jicheng Yarn (計丞紗) and Xinguang (新光) compared to the previous close. Xinyi, Jingfu, Qinxing (勤興), and Huafeng (華豐) fell slightly, and Meiya (美亞) fell by half. There were very few transactions in unpopular shares. Match, Lilian (麗安), Jinglun (景綸), and Underwear rose slightly, and the rest changed little. Forward delivery saw a slight increase for Xinyi and Xinguang. Xinyi and Meiya were flat, and Huafeng was slightly stronger. The various shares outside the market remained stable.

Transactions in foreign shares were scarce. Only Yisha (怡紗) and British United saw relatively more trading. The gold market changed from strong to weak, and the various shares fell slightly. The result was a decrease of half for Yeguang (業廣) compared to the previous close. The rest fell slightly.

### Japanese Yarn Shipped to Hong Kong; For Exchange of Goods; Selling Price Not Much Different from Chinese Yarn; First Batch of 5,500 Bales

[Our Report] There have been repeated rumors in the textile industry that Japanese yarn is being shipped to Hong Kong at depreciated prices for dumping. The reporter interviewed a major figure in the textile industry yesterday, who said: As far as he knows, the shipment of Japanese yarn to Hong Kong was contracted by the Hong Kong government with the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan. The first batch is 5,500 bales, which will likely be shipped to Hong Kong for sale after one month. However, this batch of cotton yarn is the result of the Hong Kong government's exchange of goods with the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan. The goods offered by Hong Kong for exchange are sugar and other materials. Therefore, the cost of the cotton yarn depends on the cost of the exchanged goods. However, after the war, the United Kingdom and the United States had a so-called world price for cotton yarn. The standard is 250 US dollars per 400-pound bale of 20-count cotton yarn. This is to prevent various countries from dumping cotton yarn in the world market at depreciated prices. Therefore, it is expected that the selling price of this batch of Japanese yarn in Hong Kong will not be below the world price. If calculated according to this ratio, the price difference between Japanese yarn and Chinese yarn will not be too great. Furthermore, the raw cotton used in Japanese yarn production after the war is all old cotton that has been obtained from the United States for many years. Therefore, the quality of the cotton yarn is not ideal. The Hong Kong government's purchase of this batch of Japanese yarn is intended to stabilize yarn prices in Hong Kong. All control measures will be quite strict. Therefore, even if the selling price of Japanese yarn in Hong Kong is slightly lower than that of Chinese yarn, the quantity that could be smuggled will be very small. Also, according to a cotton yarn authority, the shipment of Japanese yarn to Hong Kong will not begin until January next year. The first batch will be 55,000 bales, to be shipped within three months. It was previously reported that the price of each bale of Japanese yarn was only 800,000 legal currency, but according to the expert's estimate, it will be at least 1,500 Hong Kong dollars.

### Indian Cotton Arrives in Shanghai

### Tianjin Import and Export Industry in a State of Stagnation

[United Press Tianjin, 27th] According to the North China Trading Company, one of the major commercial firms in Tianjin, Tianjin's import and export industry has been in a state of stagnation for the past month, partly due to changes in foreign trade regulations and partly due to the chaotic situation in North China. In accordance with the newly revised regulations, registration procedures for import treasures are still in progress, so the government authorities have not yet issued import licenses. Currently, the only goods allowed to be imported are artificial dyes, explosives, linen, woolen fabrics, printing materials, door-stay glasses, and rope oil, with a value of only about 2,000 US dollars.

### Chinese Bonds on the London Market Spark Speculative Interest

### Hong Kong Overrun with Smuggled Goods

Hong Kong has become a market for smuggled goods exported from our country. In addition to tin exported from Guangzhou in large quantities, it is now learned that water buffalo hides are being transported from Hankou to Hong Kong. The transportation is organized and contracted by groups such as the Yellow Ox Party, so operators only need to send people to Hong Kong to negotiate transportation and sales. It is said that after these materials are exported, most of them seek further commercial development in Hong Kong, so the funds are unlikely to return to this country in the short term.

### Market Full of Selling; Prices of Japonica and Indica Rice Continue to Fall

### Representatives of Municipal Middle School Faculty and Staff Paid Respects to Mayor Wu Yesterday Morning; Mayor Agreed to Advance Half a Month's Salary

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Middle School Faculty and Staff Association, due to the meager salaries and difficult living conditions of teachers and staff in municipal schools, requested the municipal government to adjust salaries during the ninth general meeting held on the 22nd of this month (Sunday), putting forward five demands, which have not yet been met. As the end of the year is approaching and living conditions are truly unsustainable, they unanimously decided to take a general leave of absence on January 6th. They specially appointed Xi Zhenyong, Li Xianzhang, Zhang Zhihua, Gu Risan, and Zhu Lie as representatives, who, accompanied by Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Education Bureau, paid respects to Mayor Wu again yesterday (the 28th) at 10:30 AM, insisting on the following three demands: (1) Please issue winter clothing allowances of 500,000 yuan per person as soon as possible. (2) Before the central government's order to adjust civil servant salaries arrives, please allow a temporary advance of one month's salary. (3) Please issue salaries before the 10th of each month.

Winter Clothing Allowance Issue
Regarding the 500,000 yuan winter clothing allowance, Mayor Wu stated that there was no precedent to follow and it was difficult to comply. The total number of civil servants in the city is estimated at 100,000, requiring a total of 150 billion yuan, which the municipal government simply cannot raise. Regarding the issuance of winter clothing allowances by the Four Banks and Two Bureaus, it was believed that business organizations and administrative organizations should be distinguished, so they cannot be treated as one. Mayor Wu stated that the request of the municipal school teachers could be retained, and if there was such a method in any other part of the country, Mayor Wu would definitely find a way to achieve it.

Salary Advance Issue
Regarding the advance of one month's salary, Mayor Wu has consulted with Director Gu of the Finance Bureau and decided to advance half a month's salary on the 31st of this month and to issue January's salary before January 15th, within the Lunar New Year. Furthermore, the central government's order to adjust civil servant salaries was announced precisely on the 27th. According to the representatives, the adjusted salary will increase by about 60%, but the total amount will still not exceed 400,000 yuan.

Salary Payment Date Issue
Regarding the issue of paying salaries before the 10th of each month, Mayor Wu stated that this was not a delay by the authorities, but purely because the Municipal Finance Bureau had no income before the 10th. All tax revenues must be paid in at the earliest on the 15th, so the salaries of municipal school teachers can only be expedited to the extent possible.

Regarding the issue of the municipal schools in the suburban areas of Zhenru, Yangsi, etc., not having received salaries for three months, Mayor Wu stated that this was not within his responsibility and was likely due to delays in procedures by the auditing office. The director and deputy director of the Education Bureau have guaranteed to issue salaries on a monthly basis.

General Leave Issue
Mayor Wu believed that it was inappropriate for municipal school faculty and staff to take a general leave of absence on January 6th, as teachers should consider their status and should not threaten with a strike, which would likely not gain the sympathy of the public and the general intellectual class. He also instructed that any future actions must be communicated to Mayor Wu and Director Gu in advance. Mayor Wu stated that he was not unsympathetic to the municipal school teachers, but was powerless until the country's entire economy was back on track.

Whether the municipal school teachers will implement a general leave of absence on January 6th is still uncertain. A final decision will be made at the tenth general meeting of members on January 5th.

They are also preparing a proposal to make a final appeal to the second Municipal Council, as the Municipal Council had previously discussed improving and adjusting the salaries of municipal school faculty and staff based on fair and reasonable principles.

More than 2,000 spectators attended, creating a lively atmosphere.

Physical Education College Men's and Women's Teams Win Double Victories

In the opening game, Lixin faced the Physical Education College. The referees were Zhang Juefei and Chu Jianhong. The Lixin team was only formed within two weeks and lacked strategy and technique. Facing the strong and robust Physical Education College, they had no choice but to admit defeat, but their spirit was excellent, and they were undeterred despite the loss. Zhang Mingcun of the Physical Education College scored the first points with two free throws. In the first quarter, the Physical Education College led 11-2. In the first half, the Physical Education College held an absolute advantage with a score of 33-4. In the second half, Yang Zuxin and Jiang Shiping of Lixin were penalized for their fifth fouls and were successively sent off.

The second game was the women's group, with the Physical Education College women facing St. John's. The referee was Zhang Juefei. The St. John's players had bright uniforms and neat attire, and there was a male student cheering squad, but they could not withstand the attack of the strong Physical Education College women. However, the Physical Education College also lacked excitement yesterday, resulting in a very close score difference. The result was 17-8.

St. John's Men's Team Heavily Defeated Aurora

In the featured game, St. John's faced Aurora. The referees were Yang Liecheng and Yuan Qicai. The St. John's players were tall and burly, while the Aurora players were mostly short. In addition, St. John's had the Encas-born Bauley as center, and with Zhu Mingxing and Wu Xinyun's accurate shooting, they led all the way. Aurora was no match for them. In the first half, St. John's held an absolute advantage with a score of 31-8. In the second half, Wu Xinyun took the lead again, and Zhu Mingxing and Tao Yingshi repeatedly made great contributions. Chen Bohan, the short tiger of Aurora, made several attacks, but all failed. As a result, St. John's heavily defeated Aurora 58-15.

Five minutes before the end of the first half, Wu Mingguan of Fazheng scored again, and Lixin was down 3-0 at halftime. In the second half, Fazheng continued its momentum and launched a surprise attack. Wu Mingyu shot from afar and broke the net, making it 4-0.

### Blood! Fire! Tears! A Horrific Tragedy in Chahar Province: The Massacre of Chongli - Every Family Has Deaths, Every Household Has Cries

— Zhangjiakou, 20th Dispatch, Our Correspondent, Jiezhong

Just as the National Assembly was being held with great enthusiasm, discussing democratic governance and guaranteeing the freedom of the people, the Communist army in Chongli County, Chahar Province, with their bloody hands, orchestrated a shocking tragedy of slaughtering the people. What a heart-wrenching contrast this reality presents!

The Chongli tragedy, like the news of "Instrument Air" (a previous massacre incident), has spread widely throughout Chahar Province and the entire country. In recent days, the people of Zhangjiakou have become even more somber. Under the heavy burden of life, they are now shrouded in the shadow of terror. Stories of the Communist army's brutal killings are circulating in the streets and alleys, and refugees fleeing the disaster are tearfully recounting the horrors they experienced. On the afternoon of the 20th, the citizens of Zhangjiakou held a grand memorial service for the compatriots who died in Chongli County. The anger of 170,000 hearts surged like a raging tide. When the tragic scenes of the victims were presented before the people, their hair stood on end, and their hearts were filled with grief and indignation. Anyone with human compassion could not help but tremble with cold fear.

Commander Shi and All Officers and Soldiers Died in the Line of Duty

The facts of the matter are as follows: On December 9th, the Communist army, with a force of three brigades and over ten thousand troops, attacked Chongli County. Because the defending forces were vastly outnumbered and the defenses were weak, Commander Shi Yushan and all his officers and soldiers died in the line of duty. Over two hundred local Home Guard members and civilians held out in the Catholic Church, fighting for an entire day. Until the afternoon, the Communist army used artillery fire to burn down the church, and a horrific massacre began.

More than seven hundred unfortunate farmers in Chongli County were taken as prisoners, tied up in strings, and marched to a street corner. Two or thirty of them were killed at a time. They wanted to demonstrate their power and vent their anger by killing people. Finally, they herded the remaining three hundred or so people to the southeastern corner of the city and mowed them down with machine guns.

In a corner of the church, more than ten charred limbs were found. It is said that more than eighty civilians were burned to ashes in that building.

Orphanage in the Church: Scenes of Pain and Suffering Everywhere

On the 15th, when reporters inspected and entered Chongli, smoke still lingered from the burned-down church. Scarlet bloodstains were everywhere, along with frozen corpses. Everywhere there were cries of pain and sorrowful wails.

Entering the only remaining orphanage in the church, reporters encountered two young women who had returned without finding their husbands' bodies. They stood there, staring blankly, as if appealing to God. Several foreign nuns in white robes, with tears streaming down their faces, sobbed in broken Chinese: "This time... this time... people are killed, the church is burned, and everything is looted! The orphanage was already stocked with firewood and ready to be burned. The children knelt down and begged for a long time before it was spared..." More than a hundred pitiful little lives – orphans from a few months to eight or nine years old – held their hands together and cried: "Don't leave, please leave a few more soldiers, we are afraid!" Their tragic cries, like needles, pierced everyone's nerves.

Captain Zheng Zhonghuai: His Entire Family Was Massacred

Zheng Zhonghuai, the head of the Self-Defense Force, had his entire family, totaling twelve members, brutally murdered.

The only government employee who survived the Communist army's massacre was Zhang Jian, the secretary of the county government. He told reporters: "This time, the Communist army killed the people of our Chongli County too brutally! Adults, children, the elderly, and women were stripped of their clothes and killed on the spot. The total number is over five hundred. The number of missing people is no less than two thousand. Women cry for their husbands, old men cry for their sons, and children cry for their parents. Whether day or night, there is always a chorus of wails..."

After the massacre, the Communist army looted all the property, even taking away unfinished shoe soles. The dead cannot be buried, and the living have no clothes or food. They are all staring with bloodshot eyes, demanding revenge from the demons!

From the images captured by reporters, readers will see fragments of the Chongli tragedy. Let them tell the story of the crimes of the so-called progressive and democratic party!

Children in Their Teens: Thrown into the Fire Pit

The military and civilians slaughtered in Chongli County numbered only a little over a thousand lives. In today's era of constant warfare and massacres, with tens of thousands of casualties at every turn, this is not a particularly alarming number. The seriousness of the tragedy itself lies not only in the number of deaths but especially in the cruelty of the deaths. These were not casualties on the battlefield but a planned massacre after the fighting ended, especially targeting soldiers who had lost their ability to fight and innocent elderly, young, and women. How could they be subjected to such torture? We cannot understand how such a vicious heart could exist!

A foreign priest said: "I am over sixty years old this year, and I have been preaching for over forty years. I have been through both World Wars, but I have never seen such a tragic and terrifying scene. They killed priests, burned down churches, and more than two hundred civilians were burned alive. A child in his teens escaped but was thrown back into the fire pit. How cruel is that!" It turns out that the Communist army has created an art of killing here!

A Female Corpse on the Street: Eyes Dug Out into Black Holes

On the side of a street in the county town, a female corpse lay horizontally. Her breasts and nose had been cut off, her eyes were two black holes, and she was naked, stuck in a pool of frozen blood.

Another young man had his hands and feet nailed to a tree trunk, his arms and legs hanging from the branches, the expression of pain on his face not yet obscured by the blood and mud. An old man in his seventies had his brains smashed and his genitals cut off, his two skinny, skin-and-bone arms still tightly bound behind him.

Terror and misery envelop Chongli. Every family has deaths, every household has cries. There is no greater hell on earth than this!

The Communist army's tail-end killing in Chongli County gives people the impression that the red terror has begun. This tragedy may become increasingly horrible! Assuming that the Communist Party still wants to talk about revolution, the foundation of the revolution should not be detached from the masses. Military efforts cannot compensate for political failures. The lost popular support cannot be coerced with terror and retaliation. The people are indeed weak, but when they cannot tolerate humiliation and their lives are to be taken away, the flames of anger will destroy any oppressive force!

### Speaking of Fengqiu with Tears (Part One)

— Kaifeng, 19th Dispatch by Airmail, Our Correspondent in Bian, Wang Shoumei

Fengqiu is like a mirror. In the mirror, you can see endless desolation, misery, danger, and terrifying shadows. But at the same time, you can also see endless tension, excitement, vigor, and bright things.

Fengqiu is like a warm room without closed windows. Here, you can taste the bone-chilling wind, but at the same time, you can enjoy the warmth of spring.

Fengqiu is in suffering, Fengqiu is in progress, Fengqiu is progressing in suffering, and Fengqiu is suffering in progress. When can it get rid of suffering? It can immediately become a corner of the new China.

Fengqiu – this small county in the sand dunes, for me, there was only a plain, poor, desolate, and lonely image. I had never even dreamed of going to this desolate and ordinary place. But an unexpected opportunity finally brought me to this corner of the future new China, and I had a twenty-four-hour stay. In those twenty-four hours, I saw many things, and I also discovered many new topics. I am no longer indifferent to this place as I was before. I will never forget this place. I hope that it will soon become an oasis in the desert, and I also want to describe its current appearance.

Worried Little City

At two o'clock in the afternoon on the 16th, amid flying sand and dust, two jeeps and a sedan car carrying us eleven news reporters from Kaifeng (in addition to the reporter and Mr. Li Xinlin from Ta Kung Pao, the rest were all reporters from Kaifeng) drove into Fengqiu. On the speeding car, we saw a dilapidated city gate tower from afar. Outside the city gate, there was a long queue like a snake. Although people usually praised us as the "uncrowned kings," we ourselves had never dared to hold ourselves in such high esteem.

The car stopped, and a group of people surrounded us. They were Chief of Staff Hu from the Fifth Pacification Zone Command stationed in Fengqiu, Director Chen of the Political Department, Deputy Chief of Staff Lei from the Command, County Magistrate Liu, Speaker Liu, Secretary Jia of the County Party Committee, Secretary Long of the Youth League, and Mr. Wang Faping, a provincial senator from the county. Everyone exchanged business cards and shook hands tightly, and then walked into the city. Military music sounded. In the majestic and melodious military music, we passed before the two-mile-long queue with mixed feelings of gratitude and shame. They were the directly subordinate troops and all officers of the Fifth Pacification Zone Command, the Hua County United High School, the Jian Normal School, the Zhongzheng School, the Central School, the police station, and the various departments of the county government. What was most striking was the row of people's teams. They were wearing long robes, carrying broadswords on their shoulders, and holding spears in their hands. The formation was so neat and their spirit so full. As we walked past them, they greeted us with their eyes, making us feel very excited and sad. "What will we use to thank them?" we asked ourselves inwardly.

In the tense melody, we stepped into this small city that had experienced many worries. On the narrow streets of the city, all eyes were curiously watching our group of disheveled figures. We looked at them and looked at the wall newspapers and slogans all over the street: "News reporters are the mouthpiece of the people," "News reporters are the mentors of society," "Welcome news reporters to give us guidance and criticism," "News reporters coming to Fengqiu can give us light and reduce our pain," "..." The heavy burden and earnest hope made us feel even more uneasy. What can we say for them? What can we do for them? In this situation of feeling unworthy of such treatment, we could not help but question our own strength.

A face covered with dust, just washed away by several basins of hot water from the Political Department, Director Chen Shengren Yuanxiang of the Political Department took out a program that had been prepared in advance for us by various local sectors. The program was as follows: at 3:00 PM on the 16th, Director Chen of the Political Department hosted a banquet; at 4:00 PM, an interview with Commander Sun; at 4:30 PM, a visit to various agencies and schools; at 6:00 PM, Commander Sun hosted a banquet; at 6:30 PM, a welcome party (the Command's Juvenile Soldier Team performed Peking Opera); at 7:00 AM the next morning, participate in the joint morning meeting and give a speech; at 8:00 AM, breakfast; at 8:30 AM, a symposium with local political groups; at 11:00 AM, a joint public banquet by local sectors; at 12:00 PM, a military symposium; and at 2:00 PM, farewell.

The arranged program did not allow us to refuse. Everyone ate a meal hosted by Director Chen at the Political Department, and then we were accompanied by Director Chen to visit General Sun Zhen, the commander of the Pacification Zone. General Sun Zhen is a figure recently considered by the Chinese Communists to be lonely and sad, saying that he is currently the only military officer in Sichuan with troops, and he has endless distress and complaints. The central government has always discriminated against him, and he has embarked on a path of sadness. This old general, who has experienced hundreds of battles, has contributed to the country, and has been in the revolutionary ranks since following Cai Songpo's uprising, and has been known as the "Little Hegemon" for his courageous fighting, transferred to the Lu, Yu, and E provinces for seven years during the Anti-Japanese War, guarding the gateway to the capital and laying the foundation for victory, and earlier walked to relieve the siege of Kaifeng, and this time wielded his sword to quell the chaos of Fengqiu and Hua, is he now sad and distressed? I thought this way on the way to the Command.

Just as we walked into General Sun's courtyard, General Sun and his Deputy Commander Dong greeted us with smiles. General Sun is a refined figure in his fifties. With his gentle and elegant demeanor, if he were not wearing a three-star general's collar and a military uniform, no one would have thought that this was General Sun Nong, who commanded thousands of troops and horses and wrote many glorious histories for the Republic of China with blood, tears, wisdom, and courage. Chairman Chiang praised him as an excellent and pure model soldier, and General Li Zongren respected him as a "Martial Saint." Now it seems that this is not without reason.

After everyone shook hands, we went into the house and exchanged greetings for a while. We waited for him to speak, but he always sat there politely, as if he were shy to see strangers, and kept his mouth shut. After everyone sat for ten minutes, Director Chen knew General Sun's temper very well, and also knew that if we didn't ask, he would be embarrassed to say more, so he took the liberty of saying goodbye for us, and went outside to visit various agencies and schools, but at this time General Sun was a little reluctant to let us go.

Admiring the Ancient Well

Outside the back door of the Command is a calm lake. In the center of the lake is an ancient well. Several small paths lead from the shore of the lake to the well. Porters are drawing water from this ancient well, carrying three loads at a time. Director Chen told us that this is an ancient well, and the so-called Zhai Mother Well refers to this. Its origin is as follows: It is said that when Emperor Gaozu of Han was in exile, he suffered from hunger and cold here. At that time, an old lady surnamed Zhai could not bear to sit idly by and gave him a meal. Later, Emperor Gaozu obtained the throne, and remembering this kindness, he hurried here to see the old lady. However, the old lady was unfortunate and short-lived. She did not wait for Emperor Gaozu to repay her, and she died lonely. Emperor Gaozu arrived here, and was saddened by the news. As a result, he sealed the old lady's mound (the naming of Fengqiu County is derived from this), and because the old lady lived by the well before her death, he also sealed the well as the Zhai Mother Well. We walked to the well and looked at it for a long time, feeling bored, and then walked along the road that had been flown.

Juvenile Soldier Team

To the east of Zhai Mother Well is a magnificent mansion. A white wooden sign is hung at the entrance, with the words "Fifth Pacification Zone Command Juvenile Soldier Team" written on it. As we walked into the entrance, a juvenile soldier team was lined up at the entrance to welcome us. There were forty people in the line, the oldest about ten years old, and the youngest about thirteen or fourteen years old, with energetic spirits and solemn appearances. We secretly cheered. Walking into the door, we visited their tidy and clean internal affairs and saw their well-organized classrooms. Everyone felt very satisfied. Chief Lei and us walked and said that he set up this juvenile soldier team to take in displaced children from all over the country during the Anti-Japanese War. Originally, the plan was to provide them with pre-military education, but later, in order to make their lives more enjoyable and to encourage the soldiers' emotions with their lifestyle, in addition to military education, they were also taught some new and old dramas. Now they have also learned a lot of Peking Opera. In recent years, when the military has lacked spiritual food, they have indeed given the soldiers and the masses an infinite number of substitutes. As we spoke, we had already walked out of this courtyard and went to the Hua County United Normal School.

Schools and Agencies

The provincial Hua County United High School and Fengqiu Jian Normal School are one door and two counters, with a total of 711 students, 562 in the United High School and 149 in the Jian Normal School. Each school has its own classes, but because the teachers' salaries were different, the two schools averaged the teachers' salaries, and the teachers were used by both sides regardless of each other. The students dared not relax their learning opportunities in the extremely difficult conditions. When we entered their school in the fading twilight, some students were still groping for their homework in the dark classrooms.

After leaving the Hua County United High School and passing through the Zhongzheng Park, which was under construction, we arrived at the newly established Zhongzheng School. This school was dedicated to celebrating Chairman Chiang's sixtieth birthday. From planning, donations, enrollment, to the start of classes, it has been less than seventy days. However, looking at the magnificent school buildings that have been transformed and the uniform teaching equipment, we were a little surprised. The palace-style school gate is only slightly smaller than the school gate of Henan University. The dormitories, classrooms, green pillars, and red windows are antique and unusually magnificent. There are currently two junior high school classes with a total of 88 students and six elementary school classes with 180 students. This is jointly organized by the Fifth Pacification Zone and the local government. It is said that it was only launched on Double Ten Day. All officers and soldiers of the Command donated 20 million yuan, and local sectors donated 20 million yuan. In this way, 40 million yuan was used to establish this large-scale school. Now the students here are comfortably taking classes. According to the person in charge of the school, the 40 million yuan fund, 10 million yuan was spent on construction, 10 million yuan was spent on equipment, and the remaining 20 million yuan is now planned to purchase real estate as a permanent fund. If the above expenditure figures are accurate, this implicitly illustrates the Zhongzheng College of Kaifeng.

It was already dark, and we hurriedly went back to the Youth League.

Time was running out, and Commander Sun's banquet was changed to 9:00 AM the next morning. We went directly from the Senate Council to participate in the Juvenile Soldier Team's welcome party.

Welcome Party

The welcome party was held by the Juvenile Soldier Team at the Bian Family Courtyard. The stage was full of things, but the box made of nine Taiping Army pieces was a little uneven. Four Peking Opera plays were sung at the party: "Great Ascension Palace," "Empty City Strategy," and "Meilong Town," all of which were well-sung and well-performed. The finale was "Relying on Xingfu's Pouch," and the martial arts were skilled and sophisticated, certainly not comparable to ordinary children's opera troupes. It started at 6:30 and ended at 9:30. We watched three hours of wonderful Peking Opera in pleasure, and then shook hands with Commander Sun and returned to the reception center to rest.

After eating dinner at the reception center, Director Chen Yuanxiang was still reluctant to part and chatted with us. Everyone seemed like old friends who had reunited after a long separation, talking incessantly until after 11:00.

Night Talk of Heroes

From 2:00 PM to 11:00 PM, we were spinning around in tension. Director Chen, Deputy Chief Lei, Director Jiang, and others who were entertaining us were also playing along in the tense melody. Everyone did not feel tired at all. Some surrounded the stove and talked with Chief Lei about the current military situation, while others sat side by side with Director Mei and talked about military culture. But I was discussing heroes with Director Chen under the lamp.

"Is General Sun always so unwilling to talk? I have many things that I need to understand about him. I don't know if he is willing to tell me?" I asked Director Chen this way.

He replied with a humorous touch: "You are unlucky. The interview object you met will never allow you to achieve your goal. If you want to understand him, there is no other way except to ask you to be a guest here for half a year. Because although he is like a lively dragon and tiger on the battlefield where warhorses are galloping, he is like a secluded and refined scholar in his peacetime life. He is afraid of seeing strangers, especially news reporters. He is very happy in his heart that you have come, but he doesn't know how to entertain you guests, let alone what to say to you. Therefore, when he met you this afternoon, he never said much. I think that even if you visit him alone tomorrow, there will be no good results." "This is indeed an unexpected and interesting thing for me. General Sun has been fighting for half his life. Why is he afraid of seeing us news reporters with only a bald pen? According to you, I will not be able to understand this general. But you are an old friend of the press. Can you introduce me to General Sun as you know him?" I also asked him with a smile.

"I know too little, because I have been here for less than half a year. I only know that he has no wife and has been single for more than 30 years. I heard that a person of importance once wanted him to remarry, which resulted in a story of 'sealing gold and hanging up the seal.' Later, no one persuaded him anymore. He is naturally indifferent and easy-going, has no hobbies, likes to read, and likes to encourage people to read. He can absolutely obey his superiors, and his kindness to his subordinates outweighs his prestige."

### Wuhu Rice Market Dynamics

— 20th Dispatch by Airmail, Our Special Correspondent, Kang Feng

Since the autumn harvest, the Wuhu rice market has not been very prosperous in exports. There are many reasons, and the fact that the price of rice in the Wuhu rice market is sometimes higher than that of Wuxi in Jiangsu, Jiujiang in Jiangxi, and Hankou in Hubei, and Changsha in Hunan is one of them. The distance of transportation from Wuhu to the rice-collecting areas is also an important factor. For example, the Guangchao gang, which has always collected rice in Wuhu, is purchasing some grain from Hunan because the Yuehan Railway has been restored; therefore, the Wuhu rice market has been quite lacking since the autumn harvest, waiting for a big stomach customer to absorb it.

The Wuhu branch of the Farmers Bank of China was ordered to purchase some grain in Anhui as military grain and public grain. After the pilot project for 21 days, only one-tenth of the originally ordered futures rice was delivered. After that, they had to try to purchase from other smaller rice markets outside the Wuhu rice market. Therefore, not long ago, news spread that the rice market would be moved from Wuhu to Yuxikou on the other side of the river.

Wang Zhupu, the person in charge of the Wuhu rice industry, and others certainly could not sit idly by and watch the Wuhu rice market merchants even find it difficult to take on the supply of grain purchased by the Farmers Bank. Therefore, they invited Speaker Chen Zhuofu and others to discuss and agree to provide guarantees to the Farmers Bank in accordance with real estate and reliable guarantors, and to be responsible for the supply of grain for this purchase by the Farmers Bank at prices that were no lower than the market price and no higher than the market price.

The Farmers Bank, which is carrying out this purchase, is certainly more satisfactory to the people of Anhui than the Anhui Provincial Government's purchase of military grain in 1945, because this time the rice is purchased at the market price for cash, while the grain purchased by the Anhui Provincial Government on behalf of the Ministry of Food in the winter of 1945 was generally purchased at the low price set by the Ministry of Food, and the payment time was two or three months after the rice and paddy were handed over, so that the urban and rural people who sold the grain were equivalent to being taken away by the government.

In Wuhu, which is in a commercial slump and experiencing the hardships of December, if the purchase of grain from the Farmers Bank can be done firmly and with credit, it is possible that more than 10 billion yuan of funds will flow into the pockets of rural farmers, urban merchants, and dock workers, which can make this parasitic commercial city of Wuhu appear active and get through the New Year. However, the economic recovery and prosperity of Wuhu and the entire Anhui province still awaits a more rational national economic policy to stimulate and promote!

Because there were no coffins for burial, they had to use clothes boxes to hold the corpses, four corpses in one box. (Photo courtesy of our reporter)

Movies and Drama Published Every Sunday

### Watching Cheng Yanqiu Perform "Spring Boudoir Dream"

— Ma Huixin

Cheng Yanqiu's "Spring Boudoir Dream" is imbued with the meaning of "Pitiful are the bones by the unresting river, all are dreamers in spring boudoirs." It can be called a sister piece to Cheng's "Wilderness Cries," both being dramas that pray for peace and oppose war.

The story is set during the civil war of the Later Han Dynasty, when governors and other officials conscripted soldiers from the people, causing widespread hardship. Wang Hui and others from Pingyuan were conscripted into the army. Wang Hui and his wife, Zhang, had a very deep affection for each other. Less than half a month after their wedding, they were forced to part. Later, Zhang vaguely heard rumors of her husband's misfortune, and overcome with anxiety and longing, she fell into a dream. In the dream, she was surprised to meet Wang again, and she couldn't help but feel a mixture of resentment and joy. Upon waking and realizing it was a dream, her grief was unbearable.

The young male lead in this performance is Chu Jinpeng. Chu's appearance can be described with the four words "graceful and luxurious." He and Cheng were very well-matched, appearing like a newlywed couple. Furthermore, his beautiful figure left the audience with a beautiful impression.

"Spring Boudoir Dream" is a tragedy, so two clowns – the ugly maid and Li Xin – were added to the play to interject some humorous elements, providing the audience with some relief and preventing the bitter and tragic emotions from weighing heavily on their hearts. This was originally a good idea. However, in the third scene, "Farewell at the Long Pavilion," they were not allowed to appear alone but were forced to appear together. As a result, because of their jokes, the climax of the drama's tragic emotions was diluted, which is regrettable. Originally, the plot of this scene, "Farewell at the Long Pavilion, parting in life and death," with its sorrowful and melancholic lyrics, expressions, and tragic scenes such as the "crying head," could have easily captured the audience's emotions. After moving the audience with the preceding scenes, letting the clown duo perform some jokes would still have allowed the audience to wipe away their tears and then smile again.

In the final scene, "Awakening from the Spring Boudoir Dream," both singing and acting are crucial. Cheng's inner expressions and the skill of her water sleeves were excellent. Especially when she sang, "When I left, the flowers on the road were like brocade; today, the willows on the tower are green again; pitifully, I wait in the deep boudoir, thinking of this day since the sea-棠 bloomed... After all, men are mostly ungrateful, 'misleading others' is the essence of their fame; sweet words and honeyed phrases are indeed pleasing to hear, who knows they are all meaningless affection!" She playfully and lovingly flicked her water sleeves towards her husband whom she encountered in the dream, which was truly vivid and beautiful! It can truly be said: A boudoir complaint, expressed with a flick of the sleeve.

The use of light and ethereal music during the dream sequence is a manifestation of improved performance techniques in the Peking Opera world. Unfortunately, the lighting did not gradually dim to indicate the slow transition into a dream, but instead went dark suddenly. This was not only inconsistent with the plot but also created an unpleasant sensation for the audience's eyes.

The Peking Opera world has been talking about improving Peking Opera for a long time. If famous actors can gradually pay attention to improvements on a regular basis, then Peking Opera will not only be easily eliminated but will also have a day when it shines even brighter than before.

"Spring Boudoir Dream" and "Wilderness Cries" are both successful masterpieces of Cheng. The artistic achievements of this generation of actors have reached the pinnacle of perfection.

### Discussing "Sergeant York"

— Bao Zhongqi

"Sergeant York" is a story about the life of Alvin York, a famous hero of the Argonne Forest during World War I. The script is based on York's diaries. Fortunately, this hero is still alive, and Warner Brothers obtained the rights to produce this film, allowing this great work to be brought to the screen.

The first half of the film narrates York's rural life, while the latter half recounts his military history and experiences. The film uses York's changing religious beliefs as a dividing line and a pivot point for the transformation.

Although the dialogue in the script is filled with a strong religious atmosphere, the touching plot and performances overshadow everything else. The young York is a fun-loving drunkard who does not believe in God or religion. He has no interest in pastors or churches. His only interests are drinking, riding horses, and shooting. In the eyes of the old pastor, he is simply possessed by the devil. Therefore, the pastor tries to influence him with the compassionate and loving religious concept of saving the world, hoping to give him a powerful faith. However, all efforts fail, and the old pastor's hopes are dashed. York, who shoots all day long, meets a young woman. The true transformation in York's life probably begins at this time. How many people in history can escape this precedent? York is no exception. He begins to understand the importance of grooming himself. A person who could not be improved by any other force is now willing to bury himself in the fields and work hard all day because of love. York has awakened. He feels the greatness of love, and the power of God influences him. He realizes his past mistakes.

After converting to Christianity, under the protection of God's love, he becomes a most sincere believer. The Bible replaces all his previous hobbies. He discovers the true meaning of the book, and he opposes war because the Bible teaches him so. However, the laws of the country cannot be easily changed, and York is eventually drafted into the army. His superb shooting skills earn him the favor of his superiors, and he is promoted to sergeant. Because of his opposition to war, the officer grants him a ten-day leave to consider his decision. On a mountain peak at sunset, York carries two books: the Bible and "American History," a record of the struggle for liberalism. York begins to feel confused. Should he obey God and oppose all murderous wars? Or should he fight to defend his country, for freedom and equality? Looking at the beautiful rivers and mountains of his country, the great York chooses the latter. Although war is harmful to the people, it is still necessary to use war to eliminate cruel wars. This does not conflict with religious doctrine, so York participates in the war with a sacred sense of purpose.

After watching "Sergeant York," I always have this feeling: "Sergeant York" and "A Song to Remember" are too similar. The great York and the genius Chopin have their similarities; both are troubled by women. York realizes the true meaning of war and joins the army, while Chopin regrets everything and plays the piano to dedicate himself to his country. Although the events are different, the intentions are the same, and their hesitant attitudes are also similar. The old pastor's guidance of York to believe in religion is also very similar to the situation of the old professor in "A Song to Remember." The soil in "Sergeant York" is an unwillingness to forget the fields below the mountain, while the soil in "A Song to Remember" is an unwillingness to forget his homeland of Poland. Everything is somewhat similar.

Similarly, the directors of both films are afraid that focusing solely on the development of the story will lead to boredom, so they insert some humorous scenes from time to time. There are also many touching scenes in this film: York's mother pours a basin of cold water on his head; York works hard to save money to buy land, recording his progress on a calendar with a pen; when the deadline is approaching and he still hasn't reached his goal, York is desperate, screaming in anger, and the valley echoes; sitting quietly on the mountain, the setting sun reflects on York as he struggles to think and act. Almost all the meaningful scenes in the film depict York.

The director's technique is very concise and clever. York's fight with his rival is narrated through dialogue and then contrasted with the scene of his rival staggering away, which is very effective. Only the scene of York returning home after his victory seems too long. Other than that, the audience is very satisfied.

Among the actors, Gary Cooper, who plays York, is simply flawless. The carelessness and glibness in his conversations with the old pastor are wonderfully accurate. Other aspects, such as his sincere attitude, humorous actions, and courageous fighting, are all performed with great effort. The old pastor is also very good.

Also particularly worth mentioning is the musical accompaniment, which is perfectly matched with the plot. The music effectively captures the emotions of ease, tension, joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, completely engaging the audience.

I believe this is a deeply moving film.

### Sending the New China Theatre Company to Taiwan

— Yan

The members of the New China Theatre Company and several other theatre groups have struggled in the Southwest for several years, with many efforts and achievements. However, after the victory, they suffered a tragic setback. They drifted and moved around, unable to find stability. In today's China, where people's representatives are desperately destroying the art gardens that the people have painstakingly cultivated, this is not surprising.

Fortunately, there is Taiwan to go to, and fortunately, Taiwan has them to go to, which is a welcome thing.

Taiwan was ceded to Japan on March 23rd of the twenty-first year of the Guangxu Emperor of the Qing Dynasty. After a long period of oppression by the enemy, it finally longed for the return of the motherland. However, what is the life of the Taiwanese people like today? What are their views on the motherland? What are their impressions of the people of the motherland? Do they not feel disappointed and disillusioned?

Your trip will not only introduce the new and emerging dramatic arts of the motherland to the Taiwanese compatriots but, more importantly, it will show the Taiwanese compatriots another part of the people of the motherland, so as to re-encourage their courage.

Your performance of plays such as "Zheng Chenggong" is very appropriate. This can tell the Taiwanese compatriots, tell the Chinese people, how the heroes of the past struggled hard and fought alone to preserve a corner of Chinese territory. The current "heroes" are: the so-called heroes of today are far from the heroes of the past. We cannot wait for those heroes to be born. We can only work hard ourselves, mind our own business, remove all obstacles to democracy, and only then will the arts have a future, and the country will have a future. I hope everyone will work hard.

### Factionalism in the Theatre World

— Zhang Jiahao

We cannot deny that the existence of "factionalism" is one of the factors contributing to the current stagnation of the theatre world. This extremely bad phenomenon should have been eradicated long ago, but everyone is unconsciously allowing it to grow deeply rooted.

As early as five years ago, when I stepped into the theatre circle, I gradually learned about the traditional bad habits within the circle. Due to different working styles, there were distinctions between the "academic school" and the "Shanghai school." Due to different working positions, the purpose of the work was questioned... A playwright, a director, an actor... could also lead a group of people to form small circles and small systems similar to a team-based organization. Therefore, in the Chongqing theatre scene over the years, out of ten points of strength of theatre workers, three points had to be spent dealing with personnel matters caused by "factionalism," preventing them from going all out. This is truly the most heartbreaking thing! This strange phenomenon has produced the greatest evil consequence: "Factionalism" is not easy to eliminate, and you can forget about standing firm if you don't have a system. Therefore, these small circles and small organizations have been playing tricks such as snatching theatres and scripts under the premise of glorifying their "faction." In order to achieve their goals, they sometimes do not hesitate to undermine and accuse each other... making the entire theatre world filled with smoke and miasma. After the victory, the transfer of the theatre movement center to Shanghai added another gap between "Shanghai" and "Chongqing." Can you say that this is not a fact? I don't want to dig any further. I hope that in today's low tide of spoken drama, every worker who loves the art of theatre will quickly take out their artistic conscience to eliminate "factionalism" and save the fate of the theatre! Only "sincere unity" can resist external pressures—only "sincere acquaintance" can be self-reliant!

War and Film

Film producer Franklin, who was responsible for producing famous films such as "Lost Horizon," "The Good Earth," and "The Life of Emile Zola," and "Waterloo Bridge," reportedly said that the United States will have better films in the next few years. It took several years after World War I for the film industry to produce famous films such as "The Merry Widow" and "All Quiet on the Western Front." Therefore, the masterpieces after this war will still have to wait, it is said.

### Random Notes on New Films

— Ma Boliang

Fantasia

Beethoven, Schubert, Bach, Tchaikovsky, and others' realm of dreams is infinitely sublimated here. We criticized "Saludos Amigos" and "Dumbo," and some people even criticized "The Reluctant Dragon." Only the first full-length cartoon "Snow White" still enjoys great reputation. Therefore, Walt Disney's abilities were gradually neglected. Now, after watching "Fantasia," we firmly believe in Walt Disney's artistic talent. "Fantasia" is the highest peak of his talent, which can be said to be unprecedented, and perhaps also unsurpassed. Therefore, those later works such as "Saludos Amigos" and "Dumbo" are all eclipsed by comparison.

I believe that one of the failures of "A Song to Remember" is the lack of interpretation of Chopin's music. This aspect has always been very difficult. The boundless imagination of musicians and the emotionality of sound wave rhythms cannot be expressed by the camera. They are all ethereal and intangible. Trying to materialize them is always disappointing, just as Masao Koga could not express Debussy's symbolic beauty in "Afternoon of a Faun." Another shortcoming of "A Song to Remember" is that it is not grand enough, and the scale is too far from the vastness of the musical realm. We are grateful to Walt Disney's inspiration for these two points. "Fantasia" expresses the interpretation and expansion of emotions in the music in a detailed and exhaustive way. I think that even Beethoven and Schubert themselves would be surprised to see it. Walt Disney's exploration of the imaginative elements of their music is very creative, not only expressing many beauties that cannot be described in words but also depicting surrealism beyond imagination. "Fantasia" is worthy of the immortal glory of the twentieth century.

"Fantasia" is a suite composed of six pieces of music. The expressions in the performances are all vivid and delightful. Personally, I like Beethoven's "Pastoral Symphony," Tchaikovsky's "Nutcracker," "Night on Bald Mountain," and "The Rite of Spring." Sprites, mushroom dances, flower dances, little fairies, and flying ghosts are the most beautiful of the beautiful. The first piece sweeps away Bach's thoughts on celestial bodies, completely abstract, using light waves to rhythmically express sound waves, which is incredibly magical. Stokowski is a great conductor of our time, and his hands can indeed summon wind and rain.

Going My Way

Watching "Fantasia" is a happiness, watching "Going My Way" is a comfort. "Going My Way" is a page of ink painting of the world. Ink paintings do not have colorful hues, but they have their own clear and elegant, and peaceful characteristics. With a few light strokes, all philosophies are said.

The screenwriter has the concept of "human nature is good at the beginning." None of the characters in the play are bad people, but none of them are purely perfect people. The marrow of the whole play is a sentence from the old pastor: He always thinks of others. In other words, that person who always takes care of others, always sacrifices himself, and is not selfish. If everyone is like this, why worry about the dangers of the world? He suffers losses to help others, and in the end, he gains nothing. He quietly walks away on the snowy ground, Going My Way. Watching his lonely shadow, you suspect that no one is accompanying him, but his love and the love that others have for him, accompanied by God, are indeed Going My Way with him. The role of this young priest is extremely well written, neither soft nor fiery, just right. His character is portrayed step by step, layer by layer. He tells us that priests are also mortals. He can play jazz music, he also likes to be noisy, and he also has a romantic past. Although he became a Buddha on the spot, his nature still remains. He does not use force or speeches to improve the world. With a light wave of emotion, he arranges the seeds of happiness. We used to dislike religious films because their dryness, dullness, and high-pitched tones put us to sleep. Therefore, I passed on "The Bells of St. Mary's," but here, I enthusiastically recommend the light and meaningful "Going My Way," this 1944 Academy Award-winning blockbuster.

Director Leo McCarey's technique is smooth and concise, especially in making a story without plot come alive, warm, and extraordinary. Bing Crosby's acting is sincere and lovely, and his low-pitched song is captivating. Barry Fitzgerald, who plays the old pastor, and the other supporting actors have made excellent achievements, which is no wonder they won awards.

Westerners sometimes imagine a kind of "strange woman," just like adventurous men, who take their lives, youth, happiness, and beauty to take risks. The British people's ideas are romantic and unbelievable. The Duchess of Jazz would actually become a robber. The plot is an extremely clever Melodrama, with too many intentionally arranged traces, without any reality or human touch. The director's handling of several shots is not bad. James Mason did not perform well, and Margaret Lockwood's appearance is similar to Hedy Lamarr. The one I appreciate the most is Patricia Roc, who plays Karena, who is delicate and beautiful. The male actors are too British. None of them are eye-catching.

Spring and Autumn

### Night in the Stable

— Bao Yu

It had been snowing all day, but now it had stopped, and the wind had died down. The moon peeked out from the clouds, shining on the open land, like draping a large silver fox fur coat.

The tops of a row of jujube trees were piled with white hair, dozing in the hazy moonlight. The birds in the trees, probably unable to withstand the cold, woke up from their dreams and began to coo.

Next to the jujube trees, there was a stable. The pillars and main beams were made of thin poplar wood, and the roof and walls were made of sorghum stalks. Thick snow weighed on the roof, making the entire stable look like an old man overwhelmed by a heavy burden, leaning to one side.

A kerosene lamp in the stable emitted a yellow flame, shining through the cracks in the sorghum stalks, illuminating the many icicles hanging from the eaves, which glowed faintly.

Two tall horses were tethered inside the stable, one all white and one brown with a white patch on its forehead. They were chewing on fodder in a wooden trough, occasionally bickering over unequal portions, whinnying, and kicking each other with their hind hooves, their horseshoes gleaming.

In another corner of the stable, a little grass was spread on the ground, and a middle-aged man in his forties was sitting on it, wearing a tattered gray military uniform and covered with a tattered quilt. His face was covered with wrinkles, and the wrinkles were filled with dust and sand. A large nose protruded from the center of his face, and a pair of large eyes with long, thick eyelashes flickered as if his eyelids were fighting with the Sandman, closing and opening intermittently. When his eyes closed, he could hear the regiment commander's stern order:

"Zhao Da, I'm promoting you to be my groom today. You must feed them well, only allowing them to get fat, not thin! Do you understand?..."

He startled, woke up, and saw that the two horses were still chewing on grass.

He guessed that the regiment commander must already be sound asleep in the middle of the night, and he could take this opportunity to sleep for a while. With this thought, his eyes quickly closed, and his head slowly drooped, bumping against the handle of an iron shovel leaning against the side.

Oh, this was an iron shovel, handed over to him by the previous groom. With this iron shovel, he could shovel horse manure and accumulate it, which could be... could be...

Thinking of this, he conjured up many worries, and the Sandman could no longer invade him for the moment.

Zhao Da had originally been a cook in the regiment headquarters. He couldn't cook, he could only chop firewood and stoke the fire. Many people laughed at his incompetence, and he could only endure it.

He had an old mother at home, a wife, and two children. His wife washed a few pieces of clothing for the officers every day, and her income could only support herself. The rest of the elderly and two young ones had to rely on him to support them. But how could a cook's income be enough?

Just at this moment, the regiment commander wanted to replace the groom. He asked someone to speak for him and only then did he get this "errand." Tonight was the first night he was officially "on duty" since he took office as groom. Although the groom's and cook's wages were about the same, it seemed to him that the groom was slightly better than the cook. At the same time, horse manure was valuable. Wouldn't the accumulated horse manure be several times larger than his own wages every day? "What? Don't want to do it?"

Thinking of this, he saw the white horse raising its tail, and he quickly stood up. His legs were a little numb because he had been sitting cross-legged for too long, and his body swayed slightly. He hurriedly grabbed the shovel, walked behind the white horse, and waited for the yellow "balls" to fall to the ground, then shoveled them into a wooden basket.

The horse manure steamed with heat, and a foul odor rushed into his nostrils:

"Taking the horse manure to feed his own old mother and children..." Thinking of this, he felt a pang of sadness in his heart, threw down the shovel, and sat back on the pile of grass.

He heard someone walking through the snow, making a crunching sound.

Who was it? Could it be the regiment commander coming to inspect? He sat still, not moving. Even though insects were biting him, he didn't move.

The door opened, and a middle-aged woman with disheveled hair and wrapped in a tattered quilt came into his sight.

"Why did you come out in the middle of the night?" He recognized his wife and asked sternly.

"...This..." She stammered, unable to say what she wanted to say, only moving a step closer and closing the door behind her. Her thin face was frozen red, and her eyes were a little swollen.

"What? What did you say?"

"This errand, it's better not to do it..."

"This errand, you have to stay up all night, and you have to take the horses out for a walk during the day. How can your body, your body, be able to handle it?" As she spoke, tears welled up in her eyes. Zhao Da lowered his head, looking at the white snow piled on his wife's shoes. Then, he raised his face again;

"You go back quickly! Don't worry about me!"

"I..." A couple of lines of hot tears finally fell.

"Go back quickly!" He stood up, opened the door woven with sorghum stalks with one hand, and pushed his wife out with the other. His wife almost fell over. After she went out, he quickly closed the door.

He stood there blankly, listening to his wife walking on the snow, making a "crunch, crunch, crunch" sound, slowly fading away from nearby.

"You must feed them well, only allowing them to get fat, not thin..." The regiment commander's order seemed to be ringing in his ears again.

"Neigh..." After eating his fill, the brown horse let out a happy neigh, and then the white horse echoed him. The two horses rubbed their heads against the pillars, shaking the entire stable.

### Poetic Words

— Ouyang Qin

Don't simply list sentences of prose to become poetry; true poetry is the sand of emotion, the cage of the soul, the gold that is extracted through artistic skill

Making poetry is like climbing a mountain, each step more difficult than the last. Reaching halfway up, one turns back to see a haze of fog. Reaching the end, one suddenly sees a turning point, the smoke dispersing

### Thoughts on Water

— Li Wenxun

After being wrapped up in the mountainous regions of the Southwest for a long time, returning to the water-rich lands of Jiangnan is like returning from a barren military life to a garden filled with beauties. Here, life is vibrant, and everything seems abundant and radiant.

Water is beautiful; it is a flowing thought, possessing a graceful figure and a delightful voice.

Water is beautiful; it is a shimmering life, possessing colorful hues and boundless vistas.

A poet once said: Look, on the edge of the water and sky, a long, ancient beauty's sash...

Water gives us many flowery and jade-like dreams. A place without water is probably no different from a prison. Historically, no poet or thinker has ever disliked water; it gives them the inspiration of freedom. Shelley died in the water, Qu Yuan died in the water, Li Bai died in the water, and even the Narcissus boy in Greek mythology melted his beautiful life from the reflection of the water.

Through clear water, clean water, bright water, we see clouds, the morning sun, the evening glow, flowers, trees, and many, many landscapes in its all-encompassing flow.

Socrates said: As for us? We extract thoughts, language, and philosophy from the clouds; while water gives us many prosperous and colorful fantasies. I often stroll along the riverbank, sit on the rocks by the river, and think quietly; sometimes I sit there alone all day, as if in a delicate concert, a beautiful opera house, softly thinking of many loves, many dreams. The flowing water sings, from its lively flow, its affectionate flow; I seem to hear the pulse of my own life, and the surge of youthful blood. Sometimes I put my rough hands in its gentle flow, the water smiles and flows through the gaps in my fingers, with a slight itch, an equally comfortable tranquility, like a girl being caught and touched, at this time I clearly perceive the joy of a small life.

Water is beautiful, like an eternal music, my whole life is filled with this music. I loved water when I was very young, hugging and kissing the water in the shallow water between my mother's back, immersing myself in the water all day in the summer, being completely with the water, forgetting dinner, forgetting my mother's admonitions; even secretly thinking, one day let me wander with the water, no matter where and in what season, thinking of a city and island in the distance, maybe there is a pleasant festival and small dance.

I often stay with the people on those fishing boats, their lives make me feel mysterious, their wandering, their songs all make me intoxicated; from a young heart, an adventurous wandering has long been brewing. They tell me stories of water, I like to listen to the old fisherman's bitter experiences, like to see the healthy figure of the boat girl standing in the sunset and the water-like gentle smile.

But I am afraid to see the sea, the sea is elusive, moody, especially after I later read a Baudelaire's tragedy of a fisherman.

What I can never forget is the small night in Jiangnan, living in a winter village, waking up from a nightmare in the middle of the night, and then I can hear the quiet sound of the flowing water at the bottom of the small river, and the mournful turning of the waterwheel on the riverbank. That kind of sound makes me perceive the sadness of the bottom, like perceiving the sadness of life; until now, I have realized that the flow of the sadness of Tao is completely consistent with the desolate progress of life. It is also now that I understand why those wise men who are tired of survival want to use water as their eternal bed, even sleeping like children in a cradle, in the sound of mother-like flowing water, under the vast starry sky.

Water is beautiful, but it also contains a deep sorrow, like the tearful smile of a saint, shining in our sinful world. We can see many touching, silent tears everywhere, and many philosophers are willing to suffer in the world because of this kind of sparkle.

### Wind Fragments

— Yang Lianyuan

All afternoon, I searched for the fragrance of flowers in the cold wind.

The path in the flower garden is still the same as last year, with pairs of beautiful feet wandering on the muddy road. Let's just say they are graceful figures, casting themselves slowly on the path due to the winter sun, which made me feel lost for a long time.

Young people, what are you thinking about? The flourishing flowers in the flower garden changed from yellow to red, and now yellow and white flowers are growing again; flowers bloom and wither, how can they make me think of anything? Thinking for a long time, why am I willing to be lonely? Why am I tormenting myself for trivial emotions?

In the cold wind, even flowers lose their reserve, letting the wind ravage them. Petals flutter around my feet, and the fragrance of flowers may no longer belong to me.

Kahlil Gibran said it well, "Can the days of separation become the days of reunion?" This is always a question mark, and now that I think about it, it depends on how we insist on our respective faithfulness in the days of separation.

Searching for the fragrance of flowers in that moment, only for her beauty, is also the best excuse for why I am willing to be lonely.

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 136

— Ye Jingfeng

"At twenty-one hours, twenty-six minutes... the Secretariat of the General Staff Headquarters relays an urgent telephone call from Prime Minister Konoe from the Cabinet, ordering the 'Manchukuo' 'Chang Sheng' aircraft to cease its flight, and immediately return to its original airfield and await orders... furthermore: upon landing of the aircraft, the current Mainland Expeditionary Army Command, General Staff Headquarters Telecommunications Section, and Telecommunications Design Director, Lieutenant Colonel Tsurumi Tama, are to await further orders. This order. Duty Officer, Secretariat, Urgent."

Everyone passed on this telegram, and each person expressed their opinions on the message board:

"Just kidding, military intelligence is like 'fire.' Now it's like 'ice'."

"There must be a big event in this, otherwise, how could a troop movement order be withdrawn for such a minor personal matter?"

"A riddle! Even if a few of us make it to the mainland, we're bound to be killed in action. This omen symbolizes 'ill-fated journey'!"

At nine fifty-five, the "Chang Sheng" landed at the airfield. An officer on duty from the military headquarters was already there, ordering the captain of the "Chang Sheng" to seek instructions from the relevant departmental head regarding the resumption of flight, and ordering Tsurumi to report to the General Staff Headquarters Secretariat on duty immediately.

Tsurumi arrived at the secretariat, and after Tsurumi reported his rank and position, the duty officer immediately handed him a prepared document, told him to take the original car and rush to Beppu, saying that the Prime Minister had already called twice to inquire.

Tsurumi received this official document, and was speechless. He tried to maintain composure on his face, but his hands were covered in sweat. Why? Because he was going to see Konoe for the second time. The first time, Tsurumi was passive, and felt only a little uneasy. This second time, Konoe had turned the tables and become passive, and the situation was completely different; this would depend solely on his own dramatic acting skills. But one thing was a clear and undeniable fact: Konoe had been inexplicably led by the nose.

How do you say that? First, perhaps his intelligence specialists had reported to him about the short message in the second evening edition of the late newspaper. In his mind, he at least regarded it as the meddling of petty thieves, or enemy politicians playing a joke on him, but he could foresee that no one would be bold enough to come to his secret agency to cause trouble. In fact, it was simply impossible. Even if a few madmen did sneak in, a few guards or plainclothes detectives could arrest them in two seconds and lock them in a death row; even interrogation would be superfluous.

To put it more practically, perhaps he didn't even know about the short message at all; because from his position, he was in charge of national military plans, and how many special agency officials should he have under him? Surely there were plenty of people to handle such trivial matters? If even such a theatrical matter had to be reported to him for instructions, then wouldn't all of his subordinates, such as guards, plainclothes, special operatives, etc., be just eating and not doing anything?)

Assuming that he himself would not be concerned with such small matters, then who made the phone call to order the General Staff Headquarters Secretariat to send an urgent telegram to recall the "Chang Sheng"? Needless to say, it must have been Tsurumi's own people, creating the mystery.

However, Konoe was not a wooden man. Although he may not be considered a politician or military man of great talent and vision, it was not easy to have earned his current position, second only to one and above all others. He must have some tricks and knacks in his heart. Tsurumi could certainly use the various conveniences at his disposal, and a group of his subordinates, to create such a grand mystery. The only question was whether the person being manipulated could see through it. If he couldn't see through it, then the plan could naturally continue according to plan. But if he were to see through the scheme, wouldn't it be a hundred times worse? And it would be bad without end.

Before a violent storm breaks out, there must be a period of gloom; before a major earthquake, there must be a moment of silence; on the eve of a great war, there must be a period of terrible quiet; similarly, before Tsurumi's plan to search for the "Seven Secret Letters" was launched, there was also such a short period of silence. This short period of silence was between eight thirty and ten o'clock. In terms of actual action, it was from the time Tsurumi boarded the plane until he saw Konoe again. This was a terrifying period of silence, because during that short period of time, Tsurumi and his subordinates had lost contact.

### Mend the Roof Before the Mountain Rain Comes: A New Year's Ramble

— Du Xin

In the fading year, bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new, one can't help but feel sentimental, but even if everything is not as one wishes, one must still have new hope. Let's talk about what to do when "income and expenditure cannot be balanced."

The Secretary-General of the Finance Bureau reported on the city's financial situation at the municipal meeting, saying: "Income and expenditure cannot be balanced!"

Yes, today the entire Chinese financial situation is facing enormous difficulties, and there is a feeling of "being stretched to the limit." "Income and expenditure cannot be balanced" is especially true for general matters. It's not just Shanghai that is like this.

As for talking about achieving a state of balanced income and expenditure during times of financial constraints, it's not that there are no methods, there are some. That is "increasing revenue" and "reducing expenditure." However, the reason why the Secretary-General of the Finance Bureau said the phrase "cannot be balanced" is not because he doesn't understand the use of these two methods. On the contrary, it's because these two methods have been used too many times; on the one hand, the timing has been missed, and there is a feeling of "this road is not passable." On the other hand, it's also because this method is not the most appropriate method. For example, "levying new taxes to increase revenue" belongs to the category of "increasing revenue." But today's common people, as soon as they hear the word "tax," will think of "aspirin." Truly "old" to the extreme, how can it be "new"? If you insist on going your own way and insist on "taxing as you please," there is no doubt that you are violating "public opinion" and will arouse resentment among the people! As for "reducing expenditure," like "downsizing." However, there is also a "limit" to the use of this method, and it cannot be used repeatedly. "Downsizing" to a certain extent can no longer be "downsized," otherwise it will sharply reduce administrative efficiency! We can't say that in an organization, from the "bureau chief" to the "errand boy," one person should be in charge of everything, can we?

Then, is there really no win-win solution for China's finances today to achieve a state of balanced income and expenditure?

No, definitely not. There are methods, but I'm afraid that not implementing them thoroughly will ruin things. We know that if a house leaks, we must call a "plasterer" to "fix the leak," otherwise the house will leak even more severely! "A small hole not patched, a big hole suffers," this saying is not wrong at all. And the current China is a "ramshackle house" with "holes everywhere," which has not been repaired for many years, plus "wind" and "rain" attacks. If we don't find a way to "fix the leaks," just "catching water with a basin" or holding up an umbrella in the house to cover it up is not a long-term solution after all, and I'm afraid that sooner or later it will "collapse"!

Therefore, this third method should be a better method, and it is also a "feasible" method (as long as there is determination). Let's call this method "fixing leaks," shall we? "Dumping of foreign goods," "corruption of officials," "smuggling and tax evasion," "endless civil war"... these are all the "loopholes" in China today, and the biggest problems in financial constraints. If those "plasterers" on the political stage can find these "loopholes" and "repair" and "make up for" them one by one, then it will not be difficult for China's finances to reach a "balanced state"!

"Fixing leaks" seems to be a method that falls between "increasing revenue" and "reducing expenditure"; it also has the characteristics of both methods. What is feared is that it is easier said than done!

### Extremely Clever

— A

Once Arthur Conan Doyle (translator's note: i.e., the author of the famous Sherlock Holmes detective stories) was riding a streetcar back to his hotel in Paris. As he paid the driver, the latter said, "Thank you, Mr. Doyle."

"How did you know my name?" the author asked.

"I saw in the newspaper that you were arriving here today from the south of France," the driver explained. "Your whole appearance indicates that you are an Englishman. You had your hair cut once in the past week, and it is obvious that your hairstyle was done by a barber from the south of France."

"Amazing!" the creator of Sherlock Holmes praised. "Do you have any other evidence?"

"No," the driver replied, "except for the fact that your name is on your luggage."

### Gu Chunfan as I Know Him

— Ke Chang

Gu Chunfan, the second Director of Finance for Shanghai after the victory, is a learned and talented economist. However, Mr. Gu did not always work in the Ministry of Finance, but was a postal worker in the post office.

More than ten years ago, Gu Chunfan was only a Grade A postal clerk in the Shanghai Postal Administration Bureau. He studied economics at university and usually liked to write. Young people are often dissatisfied with reality, and he was often dissatisfied with a superior surnamed Wang, but he could not dismiss Mr. Gu (because the personnel system of the post office at that time was excellent, and superiors could not dismiss their subordinates at will). Until soon after, Mr. Wang was ordered to transfer subordinates. Mr. Gu was the first to bear the brunt and was transferred to Nanyang County, Henan Province, to be the director of a small local post office. Nanyang is a barren and poor place, and life is of course difficult, but Mr. Gu could not resist the order of his superior, so he had to go to Nanyang to take office in depression.

While in Nanyang, there was relatively little work, and there was no place for leisure and entertainment, so he devoted himself to economic research. After three years of hard work, he wrote a book on the Chinese economy and translated it into English. After these tasks were completed, Mr. Gu was transferred back to the head office, and this book on the Chinese economy was published at this time.

As soon as this book came out, it was greatly appreciated by scholars, and superiors also looked at him with different eyes. In a few years, he was promoted several times. The English version sold well abroad, and foreigners believed that the author of this book was a remarkable economist.

Before the Pacific War, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi went abroad to borrow money. At that time, the Americans already had an impression of Mr. Gu. As soon as Mr. Kong got off the plane, someone asked, "Is there a Mr. Gu here?" Mr. Kong had no idea who Mr. Gu was. Fortunately, an attendant replied, "Mr. Gu did not come with us." That's how he managed to get through it. Mr. Kong of course had to investigate who this Mr. Gu, who had made a great name for himself in the New World, was after the fact. After inquiring, he learned that he was the author of a book on the Chinese economy. After returning to China, he learned that Mr. Gu was working in the post office, so he intended to promote him and promoted Mr. Gu very quickly. In 1944, Mr. Gu participated in the International Monetary Conference because he was a currency expert.

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the postal administration's achievements in taking over were praised by Chairman Chiang. Shanghai is an international city, and those who manage finance need to be honest and capable, so Mr. Gu, who was serving in the post office, was brought to the Ministry of Finance and ordered to be the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau.

### Bidding Farewell to the Old and Welcoming the New: Talking About Firecrackers

— Huang Jieqing

Firecrackers, also known as firecrackers or crackers, are said to have been invented by Ma Jun of the Wei Dynasty in the Three Kingdoms period. By the Sui and Tang Dynasties, they were modified into fireworks, which were one of the essential skills of variety shows. The use of gunpowder to make cannons as weapons began in the Song Dynasty.

The materials for making firecrackers are: thick grass paper, fine money, mud, clay, fuse, ignition money, and black powder. Black powder is a mixture of saltpeter, charcoal, and sulfur.

Our country is good at making firecrackers, which are sold at home and abroad every year. In particular, sales to the Dutch East Indies and Malaya are the largest. Taking 1935 as an example, our country (including Hong Kong) imported 356,178 Dutch guilders of firecrackers to the Dutch East Indies.

Because firecracker manufacturers in our country stick to old methods and do not think about improvements, the maximum bursting power of the soaring cannon cannot exceed 100 feet.

The principle of firecrackers making noise and rising is: when the fuse burns, it is transmitted to the gunpowder, causing an explosion, generating a large amount of gas that is rapidly discharged backward. The reaction of the force pushes the firecracker to shoot out in the opposite direction, and because the gunpowder explosion cracks the firmly sealed paper wall on all sides, it makes a sound.

### Riding a Donkey or Riding a Horse?

— Moni

A few friends got together to chat, and once, they even talked about life issues. After chatting for most of the day, what was the conclusion? Most of my friends agree with our national essence, the so-called "doctrine of the mean." Friend A said that he had a ditty that could represent the Chinese philosophy of life, which is copied below:

"My predecessors rode horses, I ride a donkey, Thinking carefully, I am not as good, Looking back at the cart-pulling Han, Less than the front, but more than the rear."

If you want to ask, what if you have more than the "rear"? Of course, that friend riding the donkey calmly and triumphantly rode away.

In high school, I was interested in everything, had the highest ideals, and the greatest ambition. When you are in college, you are about to step into the social circle. After getting to know this society a little, you feel a little discouraged. Finally, after encountering a few nails and pouring a few buckets of cold water, you feel discouraged about everything. Fortunately, you have been poisoned by "contentment is always happiness," and after a few comparisons, you are satisfied again.

And the seriousness of the problem lies here.

If you don't move forward, just rest for a while and then move forward. It doesn't matter much. If you look back at the cart-pulling Han behind you, or even the porter: then everything is over, aren't there more people behind you who are not as good as you?

### Overseas Anecdotes

— Yunbei

Among the world's population, 300 million people suffer from malaria every year, but only 1% of the total number die from it.

Among the male and female students who enroll in large, medium, and small schools in the United States every year, more than half leave school before graduating.

Within the United States, every half minute, an obstetric nurse tells a proud father: "Congratulations, you have a boy." The seawater in the Arctic is level with the horizon, while the seawater in the Antarctic is two miles above the horizon.

In terms of population ratio, New York City does not have the highest telephone density in the United States. The following eight cities have higher telephone densities than New York: Chicago. Los Angeles. Washington. Cleveland. San Francisco. Boston. Milwaukee and Minneapolis.

### Is It Manslaughter?

— Ge Chunliang

When Professor Howard Nay was hunting in the Rocky Mountains, someone informed him that a tragedy had occurred at a campsite. Thinking that he himself might be helpful in solving the case, he went to the scene of the incident. After introducing himself, Bradlow (a friend of the victim) told him about the unfortunate event.

"When Marshall hadn't returned by nine o'clock last night, I started to worry, because he wasn't familiar with the mountain paths here at all. There were no stars or moon in the sky, and it was very dark, so I decided to look for him. Because our campsite was stationed five miles farther than anyone else's, that's what you should know.

"After adding some wood to the campfire, I went out. After searching for about an hour, I came to the slope of the canyon and saw a pair of eyes staring at me in the dark, shining at me.

"I shouted twice, but there was no reply. I thought it was a mountain lion, so I fired. You can imagine how frightened I was when I approached the place and lit a match, I had smashed Marshall's head. It was such a terrible experience!

"I brought his body back to the camp, and then went to the nearest house to report this unfortunate accident."

"When you found Marshall, how far was he from your campsite?" Professor Howard Nay asked.

"About a quarter of a mile away?"

"Now I see that your right hand is bandaged. Which hand did you use to fire the gun?"

"Ah! I can shoot with both hands!"

"Can I see your gun?"

"Okay." Bradlow said, and handed over the gun.

"Hmm! European-made, have you had this gun for a long time? How long have you had it?"

"No, it can be said to be new." Professor Howard Nay said suddenly and sternly: "Why did you deliberately murder Marshall? Don't quibble, he was indeed deliberately murdered by you."

Clever readers, how did the professor know that Bradlow deliberately murdered his companion?
