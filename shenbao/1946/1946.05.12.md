### Zhou Enlai Answers Shao Lizi's Visit: Peaceful Negotiations Expected to Resume; Political Consultative Conference Subcommittee Meeting to Reopen Next Week

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The Military Three-Person Committee did not convene today. Xu Yongchang and Zhou Enlai did not visit Ambassador Hurley all day, nor did they communicate by telephone. The only visitor to Ambassador Hurley this morning was General Yu Dawei. In the afternoon, two Associated Press reporters who had escaped from Changchun visited Ambassador Hurley. John Carter Vincent visited Zhou Enlai today, talking for about an hour. This morning at 9:00 AM, Shao Lizi visited Zhou Enlai but did not meet him. At 5:00 PM, Zhou visited Shao at his residence and had a general conversation. According to Shao, both the government and the Chinese Communist Party hope to continue negotiations and study a peace plan. Shao also told our reporter that three types of meetings may be convened next week (starting tomorrow): one is the KMT-CPC negotiation, one is the comprehensive subcommittee meeting of the Political Consultative Conference, and the other is the consultative subcommittee meeting of the Constitution Drafting Committee. The dates for these meetings have not yet been determined. It is also undecided whether the three meetings will be held simultaneously. The most important issue at present is the military problem. Without the Military Three-Person Committee, nothing can be agreed upon, and other issues will be difficult to resolve.

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Beiping, 11th] News of an agreement to stop the conflict in northern Hubei has arrived here. The Peiping Executive Headquarters, which has been shrouded in a heavy atmosphere for the past week, has regained its harmonious air. Today, government officials commented on the northern Hubei incident, saying, "There was originally nothing to worry about." The Chinese Communist Party welcomed this agreement and hoped for its implementation. Luo Ruiqing, Chief of Staff of the Executive Headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party, happily told reporters: "Although there are still crises and worries ahead of peace, the settlement in northern Hubei should be another new beginning for both sides to jointly seek a peaceful solution to general problems." However, in the reporter's observation, the solution of the Central Plains incident is only enough to extinguish the local flames of war. How to extinguish the flames of war between the White Mountains and Black Waters is the key to the current governance and chaos in China. Recently, the political takeover of the Northeast has been unable to proceed due to the problem of the Communist Party. On the military front, fierce and deadlocked warfare is underway. On the Changchun railway front, the government and the Chinese Communist Party's armies are still tug-of-war on the line from Sipingjie to Bamiancheng, and it is difficult for both sides to expect major progress. In the battle where the National Army entered Benxi southwest of Shenyang, many communist soldiers were annihilated. However, if they go deep into Andong along the Anfeng Line, it is difficult to predict whether there will be new changes internationally. Recently, in northern Manchuria, in addition to withdrawing its troops, the Soviet Union is also withdrawing its diplomatic railway personnel and overseas Chinese to the Soviet territory. What is the intention? It is worth paying attention to. In short, the Northeast problem must be clarified as soon as possible, otherwise, it may become more difficult to deal with. In North China, both sides are preparing for the worst, but there is no serious situation as rumored. Although the flowers in the Xiehe Hospital have bloomed with the arrival of spring, they no longer have bright colors, but the flowers and trees in the entire hospital are thriving. If there are no hailstorms or rainstorms in the next month or two, it will not be without results.

### John Carter Vincent Compares Himself to a Doctor, Wishing Both Sides to Implement the Agreement; The Communist Army in Hubei Requests to Transfer to Northern Jiangsu

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Hankou, 10th] (Delayed Arrival) After the Three-Person Committee returned to Hankou, they were too tired and had no substantial talks that night. It was not until 9:00 AM on the 10th that they continued their off-site negotiations. At 2:00 PM, Xu, Zhou, and Vincent resumed their formal meeting to re-discuss the demands raised by the Chinese Communist Party. The meeting lasted for about an hour. The three then met with reporters and issued an agreement document with a total of seven points, all of which were based on the one-sided demands of the Chinese Communist Party, which shows the government's painstaking efforts to make concessions and seek perfection. What is even more comforting to the people of the country is that the agreement only contains the words to stop "small-scale" battles and "outpost" conflicts, which is enough to show that the problems of the military and civilians in the Central Plains are not as serious as rumored. Subsequently, reporters asked the three about their impressions of this trip. Xu and Zhou were silent, while Vincent smiled and said, "My identity is like a doctor. It is really inappropriate to announce the patient's condition casually. What I can say is that I hope both sides will implement the agreement." After saying that, the three took a plane to Beijing.

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Hankou, 10th] (Arrival) Wang Tianmu, Zhou Enlai, John Carter Vincent, and a group of more than fifty people including staff and reporters, went to Xuanhuaidian, the details are as follows: (1) Based on what they saw, the area was peaceful with little to no sign of conflict except for the communist forces pretending to be in a state of preparedness. (2) Although the Chinese Communists continued to exaggerate the severity of being transferred, and put forward various unwarranted demands, the negotiations were quite harmonious due to the greatest tolerance shown by the political representatives. (3) The Communist Party wanted the communist troops to be transferred to northern Jiangsu. Their reason was that after entering "their own area," conflicts could be avoided and peace could be achieved. (4) The special team remained in the area to continue the investigation.

### Fierce Fighting in South of Benxihu New City is Underway

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Beiping, 11th] Xinhua News Agency claimed that the war on the Benxi front is still continuing south of the Taizi River. Benxi has two cities, new and old. The old city is north of the Taizi River and is occupied by the National Army. The new city, also known as Miyahara, is south of the river and is still in the hands of the communist forces. The National Army is advancing towards the new city along the Anji Railway and on both sides, reaching the front of the Shilitou Railway Station south of the new city. The two armies are fighting fiercely. Sipingjie is still in stalemate for twenty-three days.

### Spokesperson of the Army Headquarters Refutes Yan'an Radio Broadcast

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The spokesperson of the Chinese Army Headquarters recently refuted the various sections mentioned in the Yan'an Radio broadcast on May 10 regarding the statistics of the National Army's movements after the ceasefire, saying that they were completely inconsistent with the facts. It is claimed that the movements of the National Army in the past were limited to taking over defense operations, and the Army Headquarters notified the Peiping Executive Headquarters each time. The broadcast claimed that the entire 73rd Army of the National Army was secretly airlifted to Jinan in March, which is even more absurd. The Communist Party specializes in fabricating rumors, which is obviously to cover up its own actions in violation of the ceasefire order. For example, in the Yan'an broadcast on May 9, it falsely claimed that the National Army destroyed the eastern section of the Longhai Railway. After investigation, it was found that this section has always been forcibly occupied by the communist forces, tightly blockaded, and obstructing traffic. It is unknown how the so-called destruction by the National Army came about.

The repatriation agreement has been signed by Commander Du and US military representative Colonel Friedman in Shenyang. The repatriation is expected to be completed by September 30. A reporter asked how the Japanese in the communist-controlled areas, which account for about 70% of the Northeast, could leave the country. Friedman replied, "I have my own way." Friedman also said that at least 5,000 Japanese will be repatriated every day, first through Huludao, and then through Dalian and Yingkou. According to Chinese officials, there are 243,000 Japanese in Shenyang and 62,000 between Shanhaiguan and Shenyang. Those repatriated include military and civilians, but war criminals are not included.

[United Press, Guangzhou, 11th] All Japanese prisoners of war and expatriates in Guangdong and Hainan Island, except for 159 soldiers of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces detained in Hainan Island by the Central Government authorities, have been repatriated before the scheduled date.

### Changes in Central Government Personnel; Gu Weijun and Fu Sinian to Head the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Education Respectively; Shanghai Mayor Qian Dajun's Resignation Approved

[Report from Our Newspaper] It is rumored that the National Government will soon announce a list of personnel changes. A Ministry of National Defense will be established, and Chairman Chiang will concurrently serve as the minister. It is rumored that the Chief of Staff of the ministry will be either He Yingqin or General Chen Cheng. However, it is said that Chen Cheng will replace Xiong Shihui as the chairman of the Northeast Campaign. Gu Weijun, the current Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom, will be transferred to serve as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. It is expected that the president and vice president of the Executive Yuan will remain the same, but it is rumored that Fu Sinian will head the Ministry of Education, and Zhang Jia'ao will head the Ministry of Industry. The current Minister of Publicity, Wu Guozhen, will serve as the Mayor of Shanghai, and Zhang Daofan will serve as the Mayor of Nanjing. The former Mayor of Nanjing, Ma Chaojun, will be transferred to serve as the Mayor of Guangzhou. It is also rumored that the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, Pu Zhengdong, the Director of the Education Bureau, Gu Yuxiu, the Director of the Police Bureau, Xuan Tiewu, and the Director of the Land Administration Bureau, Chen Shiquan, have submitted their resignations to the authorities.

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Shanghai Mayor Qian Dajun's resignation has been approved. Wu Guozhen, the current Minister of Publicity, is the most likely candidate to succeed him.

It is also said that Xuan Tiewu, the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, will be transferred to a new position, and Li Shizhen, the principal of the police academy, is said to be the successor.

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] In response to the rumor that he will head the Shanghai Municipality, Minister of Publicity Wu Guozhen replied to reporters with extremely humble words, saying, "This matter was mentioned last October, but I am deeply afraid that I will not be able to handle the responsibility because Shanghai is one of the world's metropolises and the economic center of our country, and the responsibility is great, so I did not dare to take on the blame rashly." Now, the Central Government believes that Wu has served as the Mayor of Hankou and Chongqing, has been diligent in administration and loves the people, and has a good reputation, and is considered appropriate by the Chairman and President Song.

### Chairman Hosts Tea Party for Representatives of Business Associations, Encouraging Assistance in Reconstruction and Promising to Find Ways to Solve Current Difficulties

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Chairman Chiang hosted a tea party for representatives of business associations from all over the country at the Grand Hall of the National Government at 4:00 PM on the 11th. More than 50 representatives, including Wang Xiaolai, Lu Xiaobo, Wang Yizhai, Pan Yangshan, and Chen Zhimin, attended, as well as more than 20 government officials and provincial governors who were invited to accompany them. During the meeting, the representatives successively rose to report to the Chairman the various difficulties encountered by the industrial and commercial sectors in various places due to traffic obstructions, economic decline, hoping that the government would maintain and remedy them. After listening to the reports of the representatives, the Chairman made a reply, expressing his deep concern for the general difficulties felt by the current industrial and commercial sectors, promising to find ways to solve them, and encouraging the national industrial and commercial sectors to be good at adapting to the times, assisting the government in promoting post-war reconstruction work, and completing the great cause of nation-building.

After listening to the opinions of the representatives, he delivered a brief speech, which roughly stated: "The National Business Federation is holding a preparatory meeting in Beijing. From the perspective of the future of our Chinese business, this is really a major event. After the National Business Federation is established in the future, our national economic circles will have a central hub, which will be of great benefit to the prosperity of business and the development of industry in the future. As everyone knows, if we want to develop business, there is a prerequisite, which is to stabilize the local area and develop transportation. At present, the main reasons for the decline of China's economy and the decline of business are that transportation cannot be restored and the order of the local area cannot be stabilized. Just now, the representatives of Shandong and Henan provinces reported that the local people have suffered endless pain and losses in their lives and economy due to local unrest and traffic obstructions. This is what I am always concerned about, but this is a political issue, and the government will definitely do its best to seek a solution to the political issue and promote national stability and unity. At the same time, I hope that all business leaders will unite and assist the government to seek the prosperity and revitalization of China's economy. Only when the economy can be revitalized can the people's lives be improved, and the country can enter a state of prosperity and happiness."

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper Correspondent in Tokyo, 11th] Admiral Fraser, Commander of the British Pacific Fleet, held a press conference here today, attended by many reporters from allied countries and Japan.

Speaking of China, Fraser said, "The situation in China is extremely chaotic. In any case, they are still barbarians."

The following members were present: Sun Jiulu, Wei Tingsheng, Chen Zifeng, Mei Shouchun, Chen Haicheng, Wang Quansheng, Liu Butong, Lou Tongsun, Situ De, Ling Yue, Zhang Zhaoyuan, Deng Hongpu, Luo Ding, Liu Tong, Chen Yang, Hong Ruizhao, Bao Zijin, Guan San, Ma Xiaojing, Zuo [name missing], Peng [name missing] Shi, Chen Changheng, [name missing] Xiaocen, Di Ying, Cheng Yuanzhen, Hou Kejing, Zhao [name missing] Chuan, [names missing], Wu Yunpeng, Qi Zhihou, Li [name missing] Gong, He Sui, Liu Keshushu, Zeng Yan, Zhao [name missing] Hua, Tan Tiwu, Hu Xuanming, Zhong Tianxin, Wang Bing [name missing], Zhang Ximan, [name missing] Yunyan, Huang Youchang, [name missing] Yingqian, [name missing] Xiu [name missing], Xu Bao [name missing], Liu [name missing] Xun, Guo Gongxuan, Wu Jing [name missing], Zhang Fengjiu, Wang Kunshan, Yu Zhen [name missing], [name missing] Yunsu, Wu Xueyi, [name missing] Xia [name missing], [name missing] Zhenwei, Li Jinfang, Liu Kejun, Li Qing [name missing], Lu Zhonglin, Chen Xun [name missing], Zou Jinqun, Cao Jin Yuan, Yang Jiong, Wen Yuanlu, Wang Yuxiang, Huang Jin [name missing], Chen Xianyuan, Ye Qiuyuan, Wang Yihan, Liu Shiping, and Mei Shuzeng, totaling seventy-four members. The meeting was chaired by Yuan President Sun Ke. After formal procedures, Secretary-General Wu Shangying announced the minutes of the 298th meeting held at the National Government Auditorium in Chongqing on April 15th. Following this, the proposals were discussed and the following were passed: (1) the Minlin Supervisory Experiment Zone, (2) the Directly-Administered Economic Forest Farms, (3) the Water and Soil Conservation Special Emphasis Area Management Office, (4) the State-Owned Forest Area Management Office, (5) State-Run [name missing] Farms, (6) [names missing] Test Farms, and other organizational regulations. Subsequently, the amendment to the Examination and Selection Regulations for Public Servants, specifically Article 64 of the third iteration, Article 24 of the Public Treasury Law, and the organizational regulations for the National Beiping Library and the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, were passed.

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] A temporary motion was proposed by Legislative Yuan member Jian Guansan and thirty-two others, calling for a thorough improvement in the treatment of public and private school staff. They argued that with the soaring prices in various regions, the livelihoods of public and private school staff could not be maintained, which was already affecting administrative efficiency. They stated that simply issuing goods in kind as a relief measure was insufficient and would only lead to corruption. They proposed: (1) calculating the basic salaries of public and private school staff at 600 times the pre-war level, (2) providing a minimum of 150,000 yuan per person per month for living subsidies, (3) converting goods in kind to cash at market prices, and (4) implementing these measures from March of this year. The motion was principally passed, and Jian Guansan, Li Qinglin, and [name missing] Xiaocen were tasked with revising the wording before submitting it to the National Defense Supreme Economic Committee.

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] Legislative Yuan member Sun Jiulu proposed inviting President Song to the Legislative Yuan to explain the current economic policies of our country. The motion was passed, and President Song was requested to attend the next general meeting to report. It is noted that the Legislative Yuan currently holds meetings every half month, and the next general meeting (the 300th meeting) is expected to be held around the 25th of this month.

### Eisenhower Discusses Far East Mission in Japan: Studying Various Issues of the U.S. Military; Establishing Bases is to Guarantee World Peace

[Our Tokyo Correspondent, 11th Dispatch] General Dwight D. Eisenhower hosted foreign and Japanese reporters here today. Reportedly, the purpose of his visit to the Pacific is to study various issues of the U.S. military in the region. The United States plans to re-educate soldiers to become champions of democracy. Eisenhower also stated that, from a strategic point of view, the U.S. Army and Navy should be merged. When asked about the duration of the U.S. military's planned stay in Japan, Eisenhower replied that he had discussed this matter with MacArthur, who believed that the occupation would not end until the Japanese had a more valuable democratic mindset. Regarding Germany, Eisenhower believed that the most difficult aspect was political ideology. Germany had been destroyed, and reconstruction must start from the very bottom. In response to a question from our reporter, Eisenhower stated, "I hope that China can become a completely free country so that it can jointly establish world peace with its allies." Eisenhower stated that Chinese and Soviet troops would both participate in the occupation of Japan, and that the United States had no special forces in the Philippines other than those with temporary missions, as the Philippines had become an independent country. Eisenhower invited our reporter to accompany the U.S. [air force] to inspect U.S. troops stationed in Osaka, Kobe, and Kyoto.

[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] U.S. Army Chief of Staff Dwight D. Eisenhower told reporters here today that the entire key to the issue of U.S. bases in the Pacific depends on whether the United Nations organization can become a force that guarantees world peace. Eisenhower also reiterated his repeatedly expressed belief, stating, "The world cannot withstand another war. We all understand this." He also said that the major problem at present is to make the world understand that the various problems that caused wars in the past must be resolved through the United Nations organization. The issue of U.S. bases in the Philippines must also be considered in light of the future of the United Nations organization. At present, an agreement must be established with the Philippines to determine this. U.S. troops in China, having assisted in restoring post-war order as Allied troops, will soon withdraw. Regarding the participation of Soviet troops in the occupation of Japan, Eisenhower said that he had not heard of any recent negotiations, but China would soon send troops, and the Philippines could also dispatch a division, while British troops had already arrived. Earlier, Eisenhower explained his motives for touring the Pacific, saying that he intended to study military lessons related to the war in Europe for reference in long-term planning. This kind of knowledge can be obtained through meetings with MacArthur and other generals. The island-hopping tactics used by the generals here are completely different from the large-scale landing warfare in the European theater, which constantly attacked the main force of the enemy. In addition, there are the issues of occupation and the re-education of the Japanese towards democracy, the most important of which is the continued stationing of sufficient troops to complete this mission, using methods that are fair to all parties. Morale in the Pacific is very good, and the U.S. soldiers seen are all happy to fulfill their duties, but this does not mean that soldiers on isolated islands do not miss home. The occupation of Germany is also completely different, and the U.S. troops there have achieved excellent results in recent months.

### Pauley Discusses Japan's Reparations Plan: Surplus Military Factories to be Distributed Among the Allies; Claims He Will Go to Nanjing to Discuss Details with General Marshall

[Our Tokyo Correspondent, 11th Dispatch] President Truman's representative, Edwin W. Pauley, Commissioner of the German and Japanese Reparations Commission, stated today while hosting Allied and Japanese reporters: the reparations plan proposes distributing Japan's surplus factories and industries, which are exclusively for Japan's war machine and are not needed in the domestic economy, to countries that have suffered from Japanese aggression and war, such as Korea, the Philippines, and other countries, to assist in food production. Pauley then replied to a reporter from the Chicago Sun that he had not heard of China dismantling Japanese factories in Taiwan, but that he would still go to Taiwan to investigate. He then replied to a reporter from NBC that all machinery and equipment taken by the Soviet Union in the Northeast and North Korea should be regarded as reparations for the Allied nations. A reporter from the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin asked, "Has your Excellency obtained Soviet permission to enter the Northeast and Korea?" Pauley replied that he had not, but was currently in the process of requesting it.

[United Press, Nanjing, 11th] U.S. Reparations Commissioner Edwin W. Pauley declared here today that Japan's reparations plan would not reduce Japan's production capacity to below that of 1933. Japan will still maintain sufficient productive capacity to manufacture goods needed by the public. After 1933, Japan's production volume increased rapidly, and most of it was for wartime supplies. The reparations plan is to eliminate this wartime productive capacity. I plan to inspect northern Korea and the nine northeastern provinces of China after obtaining Soviet permission. If industrial equipment has indeed been removed as usual, I will provide opinions based on the U.S. position. The United States emphasizes the economic problems of China, northern Korea, and the nine northeastern provinces, and not the value of this equipment. Japan's assets in various countries in the Far East will also be included when distributing reparations. Countries with Japanese assets have already been asked to register them, and other relevant countries are discussing the issue of reparations. I have suggested organizing a special committee to handle this matter, but have not received a reply.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 11th] Edwin W. Pauley, the U.S. representative to the Allied Reparations Committee, is currently planning to go to northeastern China and northern Korea. Pauley, a semi-official private envoy of President Truman, arrived in Tokyo last night. This afternoon, he dined with MacArthur and discussed matters with Willoughby, the head of the Intelligence Group at MacArthur's headquarters. Pauley said that he hoped to stay in Tokyo for a few days, then fly to Nanjing to discuss the establishment of a headquarters in the Northeast with Marshall. It is said that most of the Northeast is under Chinese control, so it is expected that his visit to various parts of the Northeast will not be difficult. The reparations commissioner also said that he has not yet contacted the Soviet Union regarding going to the Soviet-held territory of Korea, but has begun preliminary preparations, but he vaguely stated that he [would] first go to Korea.

### Zhengzhou Strictly Bans Drugs:

#### A 60-Year-Old Female Drug Offender Sentenced to Death

[Our Zhengzhou Office, 11th Dispatch] Zhengzhou has historically been a center for drug trafficking. Currently, the 17th Regiment of the Military Police has cracked a major bellows drug case worth hundreds of millions, involving several people, which has not yet been judged. The authorities are currently strictly banning drugs. Several executions have been carried out in the past ten days. On the 10th, two drug offenders, 62-year-old Lao Di Luo Tian Shi and Wang Fengwu, were sentenced to death. All drug offenders in custody will be severely sentenced and executed daily, setting a model for the liberated areas.

### Shen Honglie Discusses Water Conservancy and Transportation: Will Go to Eastern Zhejiang Tomorrow for Inspection; The Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway Can Be Repaired by the End of June

[Our Hangzhou Office, 11th Dispatch] Zhejiang Chairman Shen Honglie hosted reporters in Hangzhou on the 11th. According to him, the central authorities in charge attach great importance to the seawall. The remaining 1 billion yuan of construction funds will be issued within days. The water conservancy budget is 1.6 billion yuan, and it has been agreed to issue 1 billion yuan first. The urgent and important projects in the Qu County, Linhai, and Tongzhu areas will be carried out first. The original 280 million yuan in highway repair funds can be received as is, and an additional 150 million yuan will be allocated for the Lanxi, Shouchang, and Baisha line projects. Once this road is repaired, transportation between Zhejiang and Jiangxi will be connected. It has also been agreed that the central government will be responsible for repairing the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway and the Qiantang River Bridge. It is estimated that the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway can be completed by the end of June. Construction on the Qiantang River Bridge can also begin as soon as engineers come to Hangzhou to survey the site. After the special county donations are all stopped, it will be even more difficult to balance local financial revenues and expenditures. The central government has agreed to have the Four Banks Joint Treasury borrow and allocate 1.2 billion yuan to this province first to provide a transition. In addition, the food and salaries of the security forces have been agreed to be increased as stipulated, and the food expenses of public-funded students in provincial schools have also been clearly stated to the authorities in charge in order to improve them. Also, it is reported that the newly appointed Director of the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province, Luo Fulun, came to Hangzhou on the 12th, and Cheng Yuanfan, Director of the Finance Department, will also come to Zhejiang from Chongqing within days to take office. Chairman Shen is scheduled to go to various counties in eastern Zhejiang on the 13th to inspect and preside over administrative meetings in the 4th, 5th, and 11th districts, and to consult with Pacification Director Yu Hanmou on the issue of public security in Zhejiang Province.

[Our Hangzhou Office, 11th Dispatch] There are currently 20,000 dan of rice in Hangzhou. Another 20,000 dan have recently been transported from Fujian and Anhui, so there will be no problem with food for the people. Rice prices are gradually stabilizing and tending to fall.

### Soybeans are Worth Hundreds of Millions: Why Does China Neglect Them? ArnoLte's Report

[Associated Press, New York, 10th] In a report submitted to the China Research Institute, ArnoLte, the former U.S. Commercial Counselor in China, said that if cultivated carefully, China could turn its "neglected" soybeans into a huge industry worth hundreds of millions. The report has now been published in the China Research Institute's quarterly. ArnoLte described the origin and history of soybeans in detail and pointed out their commercial and nutritional value. He said, "There is one thing I sincerely cannot understand, why do the Chinese people neglect soybeans, and are they not aware of its importance to this extent?" ArnoLte pointed out that soybeans are highly valued in the United States. In 1907, only 50,000 mu of land were planted, but by 1943, it had expanded to 16 million mu. In 1925, the United States produced 5 million U.S. bushels of soybeans, which increased to 193 million U.S. bushels in 1944. "This is almost equal to the entire output of China (including the Northeast)." At this time of famine in the Far East, China can use soybean milk to replace cow's milk. Soybeans can be planted everywhere in China. "The Chinese government should do its best to encourage private enterprises to establish soybean industries, especially those engaged in the production, trade, and other soybean food products of soybean milk. This move can help rebuild China's post-war economy," he said.

### Communist Gao You County Magistrate: Secretly Comes to Zhenjiang to Surrender

[Our Zhenjiang Office, 11th Dispatch] Yang Tianhua, the Communist magistrate of Gao You County, and Zheng Ping, the secretary of the Eastern Rugao County Party Committee, secretly came to Zhenjiang yesterday to surrender to the authorities and issued a declaration, vowing to fight to the death against the Communist Party, which betrayed the nation, under the leadership of the Kuomintang.

### Xu Zhen Discusses Impressions of the Inspection Tour: Most of the Farmland in Western Liaoning Has Been Sown; Communist Army's Destruction of Railways Affects People's Livelihoods

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 11th Dispatch] Xu Zhen, Chairman of Liaoning Province, returned from an inspection tour of western Liaoning. According to him, recently, the Communist army often destroyed bridges and tracks along the Suizhong area of the Beining Railway, which has a serious impact on the national livelihood. On the evening of the 6th, he led several staff members from Shenyang west. In four nights and three days, he personally visited Xinmin, Dahu Mountain, Goubangzi, Jinzhou, Jinxi, Suizhong, Huludao, Shanhaiguan and other places. The people who have returned to the embrace of the motherland, their patriotic feelings, and boiling blood are inspiring. In order to inspect the bridges, bunkers, the deployment of the garrison, and the deployment of railway laborers along the way, I stopped the car at each bridge late at night to check them one by one and give instructions. The military and civilians in various places were extremely excited. In addition, the damage suffered in western Liaoning is very slight because the national army took over earlier. Most of the farmland has been sown. Although there is a shortage of manpower, draft animals, and agricultural implements, it is not a major problem. As for the police brigades, volunteer police teams, and militia joint defense teams responsible for local public security, and the actual situation of education, people have been sent to various places at all levels to conduct thorough investigations.

Suzhou

#### Wujin Villagers Destroy Courthouse

In the case of the sudden death of Xu Chu Fengdi, a woman from Tongzhuang Township, Wujin Seventh District, it was determined by the County Procuratorate in February that she died of acute dysentery. Her father, Chu Fanglin, was not convinced and appealed to the Suzhou High Court, which approved sending staff from the Wuxi County Procuratorate to Changzhou to exhume the body for a second autopsy. However, Liu Enci, the procurator who came to examine the body, did not perform the exhumation procedure and also ruled that she died of acute dysentery. This aroused public outrage among dozens of people, who went to the Wujin County Court to destroy furniture, tear up documents, and remove the plaque that was hung in the courtroom, "The Nation is Governed by Law," and changed it to "The Nation is Governed by Money," and paraded it around. The situation is likely to escalate. The County Court President Sun Jing and Chief Prosecutor Wang Yuxiu came to Suzhou to ask for instructions. The High Court sent Prosecutor Shen Bingrong and Clerk Wang Rong and a court policeman to Changzhou on the 10th to investigate the truth. Sun and Wang went to the Ministry of Justice in Nanjing to report.

Changshu

#### The County Government Expands and Merges Township Areas

In order to expand the area of townships and improve township organizations, the county government decided to reduce the original 260 townships in the county to 82 townships. In addition to sending it to the County Temporary Council for review and submitting it to the province for approval, it ordered that it be implemented in all districts from June 1st. The selection of township chiefs is currently being carried out carefully.

#### Farmers Dig Dyke to Obstruct Irrigation

Chuan Port, which is located at the junction of the Seventh District of this county and Cheng County, has always been the exit of the mountain pass in the Cheng territory. The water flow of Chuan Port is necessary for the irrigation of farmland in the Chang territory. This spring, Cheng County built a sand field and built a dyke at the Duan Mountain pass to cut off the flow, causing the Chuan Port to dry up and unable to irrigate, arousing the anger of the farmers in the Chang territory. On the 8th, more than 5,000 farmers dug up the dyke to open the water flow and presented a petition to the county, which was forwarded to the province, to stop the construction of the dyke.

Wuxi

#### A Large Number of Smokers Forcibly Rehabilitated

The city defense headquarters of this county is determined to eradicate drugs. It has designated Dushan Temple in Taihu Lake as a drug rehabilitation center. Starting at 12:00 AM on the 9th, it ordered the mobilization of military police, together with township and baojia chiefs, to implement the search and arrest of smokers. As a result, two or three hundred people were arrested on the spot and temporarily detained in the township offices. On the morning of the 10th, they were all escorted to Dushan for group rehabilitation.

Quzhou

#### The Provincial Government Issues an Order to Abolish Special Product Donations

Due to financial difficulties in this year's budget, Zhejiang province's county governments have opened up and collected special product donations to offset their financial balance. These levies included over a dozen goods produced in eastern Zhejiang such as, bamboo, wood, paper, oil, silk, tea, ham, cotton cloth, and mushrooms. These special donations have become a variable corvée tax which has disturbed the area and caused the people to be annoyed. The provincial government received reports from all sides and for the reason that the special product donation was only to offset the financial inadequacies of the various counties and the actual amount collected has been meager, and the people have been greatly harmed, an order was sent to the counties to all cancel their product collections and that there be no further collection. In addition, the Sixth District Commissioner's Office of Zhejiang Province, fearing that the counties under its jurisdiction would privately collect illegal donations and taxes, issued an order to all counties under its jurisdiction the day before yesterday to strictly prohibit the unauthorized collection of donations and taxes.

#### Suspect Arrested Refuses Bail

Xiao Jugen, who once served as the district chief of Hang County, did not change his style of acting tyrannically in the countryside during the guerrilla period after the victory. The Hang County government had requested the higher authorities to issue an arrest warrant, but he had not been arrested. Recently, Xiao was hiding at No. 1 Jiaoren Lane, Jiaoren Street, Hangzhou, and was discovered by Shen Jie, the township chief of Xian Shi Township, who was ordered to conduct a secret investigation. He consulted with Lu Shushi, the executive committee member of the county party headquarters, and Li Caizhang, the county senator, and reported to the Second Branch of the Provincial Capital Police Bureau. On the morning of the 2nd at 11:00 AM, they went to Jiaoren Lane to arrest Xiao and transferred him to the county government for prosecution. It is reported that Zheng from the county party headquarters intended to bail him out because he had previously worked for Xiao in underground work. The county government believed that there was no definite evidence for the so-called underground work because Xiao was suspected of being a traitor and had refused the bail.

### Current Problems in Foreign Trade

— Yu Zengkang

Since the victory, maritime transport has been open for almost half a year, but the progress of international trade has consistently been in a pessimistic atmosphere. China's foreign trade was originally not very reasonable, and now it has added many difficulties, making it even more difficult for trade trends to return to normal. Whether or not foreign trade is reasonable is related to the development of the entire economy, so current trade problems urgently need to be adjusted and reasonably resolved. The author would like to express his humble opinions on what he has observed, and hopes for correction from experts.

After the opening of the foreign exchange market on February 4th, the current exchange rate, in terms of purchasing power parity, shows that the national currency is too high. This makes imports easy and exports unfavorable, and even industries and agriculture are feeling severely threatened, gradually becoming panic-stricken. As a result, at the beginning of this month, many rumors about foreign exchange policy arose, and the price of US dollars fluctuated sharply. The instability of the US dollar makes it difficult to stabilize foreign exchange, which shows that there are some problems with the exchange rate. At the same time, arguments have also arisen to devalue the currency and raise the exchange rate. If China wants to enhance its productivity and improve its economic status in the future, it must seek to expand trade. But to expand trade, it is necessary to revitalize exports first. More exports can then be exchanged for more imports to facilitate the advancement of economic construction. In order to promote exports, there must be a favorable exchange rate to encourage them, so countries all use currency devaluation as the only means to compete in the international market. Moreover, unreasonable imports must be stopped quickly. Although the reasoning is like this, we dare not agree with letting the exchange rate float freely in the current transition period when the domestic economy has not yet stabilized. This is because: first, although the current exchange rate is not fixed, any change will shake the people's confidence in legal tender, and speculation in US dollars and gold will further trigger financial chaos. Second, current prices are still in a state of unabated inflation, and if the exchange rate changes, prices will definitely not stop there just because their ratio is already higher than the ratio of the exchange rate. They will inevitably rise with the increase in the exchange rate, and it will be difficult to adjust the exchange rate and prices in the short term, so the hopes of exporters will still be difficult to realize. Moreover, the re-stirring of prices is not in the interest of industry and commerce. Third, the current domestic production situation is extremely bad, and the amount available for export is very small, so the effect of promoting exports that can be obtained from raising the exchange rate is probably very limited. Therefore, changes to the exchange rate should be carefully considered at this time.

Secondly, we currently do not want to further stimulate price fluctuations by raising the exchange rate, nor do we want to waste limited foreign exchange funds on unnecessary things and repeat the mistakes of the gold policy. Therefore, we hope that on the one hand, we must start with rectifying finances and tightening currency to fundamentally solve the price problem, thereby reducing the threat to the exchange rate. At the same time, on the foreign exchange itself, rather than changing the exchange rate, it is better to first make changes to the technology of foreign exchange settlement and trade management to adjust the current trade situation, and also improve the unreasonable state of the current exchange rate. In this way, currency confidence will not be shaken, and even more benefits can be gained than changing the exchange rate.

For the sake of current reconstruction and future construction, a large amount of imports are required so that industries can be developed and the country can enter a modern state. But to complete the mission of national construction, imports must be reasonable. Unfortunately, current imports have not been in line with the policy of national construction: first, most of the imported goods are not production equipment needed for construction, but only consumer goods; second, importers often do not consider the domestic supply and demand situation, but only consider the amount of price difference between domestic and foreign countries, blindly proceeding, resulting in the disadvantage of excess imports, of which caustic soda can be used as proof; third, the goods ordered by importers do not always consider whether they are needed domestically, resulting in a large amount of imported American cotton having very limited sales in the country. Such imports are chaotic and without planning. They cannot improve the domestic production situation, relieve the shortage of materials, but only waste limited foreign exchange funds. It is very regrettable that they are uneconomical! Moreover, the large-scale import of foreign consumer goods only increases the threat to industry and hinders the advancement of industrial recovery; while blind imports are difficult to guarantee even from the perspective of merchants' profits. This trend is not beneficial to the country or merchants, and the government must not allow it to drag on any longer. It must quickly seek improvement. As for raising the exchange rate, although it can have some improvement on this unreasonable situation, it cannot completely correct it, and it is also inconvenient to change it at present. Therefore, in order to make imports develop reasonably to meet economic needs, there is only one way to change the technology of foreign exchange settlement and trade management to strengthen control. The author believes that the authorities must conduct a detailed investigation and make overall plans on the current domestic supply and demand situation and the types of goods needed, and give importers active guidance so that imports can be rationalized and planned. The above-mentioned disadvantages of excess imports and unmet needs can be eliminated. At the same time, improvements must be made to foreign exchange settlement. Various conveniences must be given for production equipment and essential materials; if only consumer goods are involved, strict review must be carried out. Imports should be curbed or reduced except for those that cannot be produced domestically or are not produced enough, so that the types of imported goods can be changed from consumer to productive. In this way, the panic of industry can be relieved, our productivity can be enhanced, and the solution to the current price problem will be greatly helpful.

From this, we can see that the increase in imports in the future will be very considerable, especially for productive materials, which is the inevitable result of promoting industrialization. In order to cope with this huge amount of imports, although we can rely on foreign capital, we must still strive to export to enhance our foreign purchasing power and seek the development of national capital. The importance of export trade in economic construction in the future can be known. The revitalization of exports is inevitable. Although the current export trade is very pessimistic, we must find ways to remedy it and strive to improve it in preparation for large-scale expansion in the future. The unfavorable exchange rate for exports is a temporary phenomenon, and it will inevitably be adjusted in the future. However, future exports cannot only rely on raising the exchange rate, because too high an exchange rate is not what is needed for post-war economic construction. Moreover, the reason why exports have been sluggish in the past also has its fundamental reasons. If these key problems are not resolved, even if a favorable exchange rate is set, its development will be limited and it will still not be able to meet the needs of economic construction. Therefore, for the revitalization of exports at present, instead of arguing about changes in the exchange rate, it is better to make fundamental reforms as soon as possible to enhance export capacity. According to the development of exports, sufficient productivity and strong sales force are necessary conditions. China's export goods are far from these conditions. If they are not improved, how can they compete in the international market to gain an advantage? Regarding this point, according to my humble opinion, attention should be paid to the following: First, China's main export products, silk and tea, have suffered serious damage during the war. Not only has the production quantity been greatly reduced, but the quality has also been lowered. Naturally, they urgently need to be restored so that exports can be revived, but this cannot be achieved in the short term, and requires the active assistance of the state. Second, China's exports are still limited to agricultural products and raw materials. The narrow range of export goods severely restricts trade development. Therefore, the types of export goods must be actively expanded in the future to enhance export capacity. And it must also be extended to manufactured goods to improve exchange conditions and adjust trade trends, which is necessary to improve economic status. This point is of great importance and must be closely monitored and actively improved. Third, the quality must be improved and standardized to consolidate and expand the market and occupy an advantageous position. Fourth, protect the interests of producers so that they can increase production and reduce export costs to enhance external competitiveness. Both of these measures lie in the reduction of the middle exploitation layer. Fifth, strengthen trade organizations, and the government must implement incentive policies so that the sales force of export goods can be enhanced. The above five points are basic issues in promoting exports that urgently need to be resolved and cannot be delayed any longer.

The market issue is also an important issue in developing export trade. In order to seek a large-scale expansion of exports, it must be diversified. It is wrong to only focus on the United States now. We must work hard to find markets all over the world, and we must suit the market and seize it. Originally, Nanyang, the main market for China's exports, after Japan's fall, China must quickly rise to replace it and be in a leading position, because Nanyang can be a very promising market for the development of China's industrial products in the future, and help our industrialization construction. In the future, exports to the United States will be mainly special raw materials, supplemented by exquisite handicraft products; exports to Nanyang will be cheap industrial products. These exports are all suitable for China's production capacity. In the post-war era, since there is such a broad market, exporters and industrialists should have a long-term vision and move forward as soon as possible to face future expansion, and must not abandon themselves because of the current weakness and unfavorable exchange rates. Especially in the Nanyang market, if China delays any longer, Japan is likely to quickly resume exports, and the Indian textile industry already has surplus capacity to supply. If we miss the opportunity, it will be by no means easy to compete for the market in the future, and it will have a serious adverse impact on my country's industrial development.

In short, future foreign trade must be in line with the country's economic construction policies, so the current unreasonable state should be improved as soon as possible. As for exports, efforts should first be made to remove the original obstacles, increase production, and improve operations at the same time to strive for the market. These are all prerequisites, and changing the exchange rate is not yet the time at present.

### Stalemate on the Italian Issue among the Four Powers has been Partially Broken; Soviets Agree to UN Trusteeship of Tripoli; Informal Meeting Held Yesterday

[Reported by this newspaper] London, 11th: The Foreign Ministers' Conference, which was on the verge of collapse, has now been revived. Yesterday, the Soviet, British, and French Foreign Ministers earnestly put forward new proposals as follows: (1) The Soviet Union agrees to give up its request for trusteeship of Tripoli, and Italy will manage it independently under the supervision of the United Nations. (2) The British side agrees to give up the Libyan independence plan, and Italy will implement the trusteeship system in Tripoli, but the British side must obtain trusteeship over Cyrenaica. (3) The French Foreign Minister suggested that the Soviet Union should obtain £25 million in compensation from Italy, and other compensation can be replaced by ceding territory. Molotov said he did not object, but Byrnes argued that £2.5 million should be taken from Italy's industrial assets abroad.

[Reported by this newspaper] London, 11th: The Italian compensation and colonial issues were still the subject of discussion at the Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Conference today, with mixed results. Yesterday, Molotov and Bevin suddenly worked hard to find a compromise on the Italian colonial issue. At the same time, during today's informal talks, the Foreign Ministers also made a final effort on the Soviet demand for Italian compensation, trying to find a compromise. It has been found that the Foreign Ministers' Conference has undergone great changes this week. Negotiations had previously reached a stalemate, but now, due to the final struggle of the Foreign Ministers, a ray of hope has appeared.

[Associated Press, Paris, 10th] The Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Conference seemed to improve today. Regarding the handling of Italian territories, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes agreed with the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's motion, but attached the condition that Libya and Eritrea should be allowed to become independent after ten years. However, according to British sources, British Foreign Secretary Bevin insisted that Libya and Eritrea should be granted independence immediately, and requested that Cyrenaica in Libya be placed under British trusteeship. Some observers believe that Molotov's actions are sufficient to imply that the Soviet Union almost wants to avoid any responsibility for undermining future peace conferences.

[United Press, Paris, 10th] The Four Powers Foreign Ministers, in order to break the stalemate on the issue of peace in Europe, announced today that they had drafted three preliminary agreements: (1) to place Italy's South African colonies under the trusteeship of the United Nations; (2) to give the Soviet Union compensation of 100 million yuan from Italy; (3) to appoint an Allied committee to supervise the trial of war criminals.

[Reuters, Paris, 10th] The stalemate on the Italian issue at the Foreign Ministers' Conference seems to have been partially broken. Molotov has agreed to abandon the Soviet Union's individual trusteeship demand for Tripoli, and supports France's proposal to place the area under UN trusteeship and allow Italy to participate. Byrnes further suggested that a condition should be attached, stipulating that Libya and Eritrea may be made independent within ten years, before the French proposal can be approved. Although no agreement has been reached at that time, the possibility seems to be not small. British representative Bevin advocated that the United Kingdom should be entrusted with the custody of Cyrenaica and Senussia. Regarding the compensation issue, France also proposed a compromise. The Soviet Union originally demanded that Italy pay 300 million yuan in compensation, of which 100 million yuan was to be paid to Greece and Yugoslavia. Bidault believed that Yugoslavia may be able to obtain some territorial concessions, and the Soviet Union is the only country among the Allies that has not controlled Italian foreign funds, so its request should not be considered excessive. Byrnes agreed to consider this suggestion and said that he may approve it.

### Churchill Explains to Reporters the Plan to Form a European Federation, Saying that it Can Start Locally and Gradually Expand; Expresses Concern about the Situation in Germany

[Reuters, Amsterdam, 11th] Churchill said in a speech to more than fifty Dutch journalists yesterday: If we cannot organize a federation that includes the entire Europe, we should first organize the part that can be organized, and then gradually expand it. Churchill expressed concern about the situation in Germany, and he hoped that the German people could become independent as soon as possible. When reporters asked whether Western Europe should wait for the Soviet Union's consent at the beginning of organizing the federation, Churchill replied: This is the question of how long we should wait, which is undecided. Churchill had lunch with Queen Wilhelmina in the palace yesterday and went to Leiden University in the afternoon to receive an honorary doctorate.

### This Kind of Churchill's Claim has Been Proposed More than Once

[Associated Press, New York, 10th] Churchill's proposal to establish a European Federation including Eastern and Western Europe, this dramatic proposal, has re-promoted the idealism that has been studied for several generations. Churchill made this amazing plan at a time when relations between the Soviet Union and Western Allied countries were precarious. He had just expressed his loyal understanding to the Soviet Union two days ago, saying that this would avoid disaster. What is worth noting is that Churchill has advocated this kind of unity more than once. In 1940, when France appealed to Germany for peace in a tragic defeat, the government led by Churchill proposed to sign a sacred alliance agreement with France. This plan would allow Britain and France to declare a merger into a British-French Federation, no longer divided into two. It is hoped that Churchill will further analyze his current proposal, especially the phrase "including both Eastern and Western Europe." In practice, the Soviet Union has incorporated all of Eastern Europe and the Balkan Peninsula into its sphere of influence, and has apparently established an Eastern Federation. Then, it is only necessary to create a Western Union to seek coordination between the two parts. The ideal of a European Federation has been discussed countless times in the 19th century. The United States of America has succeeded in maintaining the unity of the forty-eight states. The promoters of this plan are mostly encouraged by this. From a historical point of view, since the collapse of the Roman Empire, there have been Napoleon in the distant past and French Foreign Minister Briand after World War I who advocated the organization of a European Federation. According to Briand's plan, the European Federation has a total territory of 1.932 million miles and a population of 250 million. The world's people find it quite touching, while the opponents regard it as the pursuit of long-haired idealists.

### Iran and Azerbaijan Negotiations have Established Partial Agreements

### Stalin's "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)": Has a Close Impact on the Global Situation

[Reuters, Moscow, 11th dispatch] Although few outside know about Stalin's book "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)", it is the best-selling book in the country. Since the publication of the revised edition seven years ago, a total of 21 million copies have been sold, and it has been published in 60 different languages. Observers believe that the book has a close impact on the future global situation, and its importance is no less than the "Bible" and the "Quran". The book states: Since capitalism has entered socialism, making the working class free, one cannot use gradual reform, revolutionary methods must be employed. Therefore, to prevent policy errors, everyone should be a revolutionary and not a reformer. Capitalism and revolution are irreconcilable. There are irreconcilable elements within the capitalist system. Capitalism is the motive for aggression, so capitalist countries recognize war as a natural and legal action. The book recounts the scene of foreign capitalists uniting with the Tsar to oppress the working class, and the details of the civil war and intervention period are particularly detailed. The book ends with six conclusions: (1) A people's revolution cannot be successful without the revolutionary party of the proletariat; (2) the Bolshevik Party cannot succeed if it does not believe in Marxism-Leninism; (3) the elimination of splitters is one of the reasons for the success of the social revolution; (4) one should take an uncompromising attitude towards opportunists within the party; (5) one should encourage criticism and recognize one's own shortcomings; (6) One should maintain the closest contact with the people to become a truly people-centered regime.

### U.S. Senate Passes Loan to Britain: The House of Representatives is Scheduled to Begin Discussion This Week

[United States Information Service, Washington, 10th dispatch] The Senate today passed a $3.75 billion loan to Britain by a vote of 46 to 34 to assist Britain in participating in the development of peacetime international trade worldwide. This resolution has now been submitted to the House of Representatives for consideration. The House Banking and Currency Committee is scheduled to begin discussions next week. The British Parliament has approved the loan agreement. Once the U.S. House of Representatives approves it and President Truman signs it, the agreement will take effect. Treasury Secretary Vinson summarized the purpose of the loan as follows in a subcommittee meeting in the Senate considering the loan: The loan to Britain is part of our international economic cooperation plan. A peaceful and prosperous world requires Britain and countries closely linked to Britain to fully participate in the world economy. The policies chosen by Britain to deal with its expenditures will affect the economic well-being of the whole world. The United States has an important relationship with the solution to this problem.

[United Press, Washington, 11th dispatch] Democratic Representative Sparkman predicted today that the House of Representatives could pass the loan to Britain bill by a majority vote within three weeks.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th dispatch, United Press] After passing the loan to Britain bill, the Senate decided to discuss the bill to prevent strikes with 66 votes against 9.

Paid Off Within Five Years

[United Press, Washington, 10th dispatch] The British loan bill passed by the Senate stipulates that the Treasury Department will continuously pay funds to Britain within the next five years, until the entire loan of $3.75 billion is paid off.

In exchange, Britain agrees to lift wartime currency restrictions within a year. According to this restriction, the so-called Sterling Area can only purchase British goods and use them in Britain for the price of goods sold to Britain. Republican Senator Taft, an opponent of the bill, declared in the Senate that Britain needs 2.2 billion to meet its emergency financial needs, and 1.3 billion to transport British troops from all over the world back home, leaving very little for long-term financial assistance.

Bevin Expresses Gratification

[United Press, Paris, 11th dispatch] British Foreign Secretary Bevin said this morning after learning that the U.S. loan to Britain had been passed by the U.S. Senate: "The news is gratifying.

[Reuters, London, 11th dispatch] Peiffer Whiteley, a cabinet member of the British Churchill Cabinet, spoke three minutes after the U.S. Senate approved the loan to Britain last night, saying, "We have sold the empire and got a small sum of money. The land we have sown will be reaped by the United States in the future."

[Further dispatch] Although the U.S. Senate has approved the loan agreement to Britain, it still has to go through the debate in the House of Representatives, so the British government does not want to publish a document immediately. However, according to an informal statement by a government official, they are deeply gratified by the Senate's move. According to Brewer, President of the National Association of Manufacturers, he personally is not very interested in the agreement, because it is closely related to the Bretton Woods Agreement and the removal of tariff barriers, but the loan can indeed help Britain through the most difficult period. According to general expectations, the British government originally intended to take some restrictive measures, especially restrictions on purchasing goods from the dollar area. Now that the U.S. Senate has passed it, these methods will not be implemented for a while.

### Premier Song Cares for People's Food: 2 Million Stones of Sichuan Rice: Urgently Transported to Shanghai; Transported by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Landing Craft; Food Administration Authorities Order Rice Merchants to Rush to Production Areas to Purchase

According to Pang Songzhou, Vice Minister of the Food Ministry, who told reporters at his private residence last night, "Premier Song is extremely concerned about the food problem in this city. He has instructed the Food Ministry to purchase 2 million stones of rice in Sichuan Province and try to transport it urgently to the east, and has instructed the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to send ships to load it. At the same time, it has rented 20 landing craft from the U.S. military to assist in transportation, which will be managed by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Each landing craft has a load capacity of about 250 to 350 tons. One of them has already set off on a trial voyage.

Also, the rising rice prices in recent days have caused anxiety among the general public. According to the investigation, the main reason is that the county governments in various rice-producing areas have taken measures such as banning grain exports to maintain local food supplies. Reporters went to various rice wharves in the city yesterday to conduct on-the-spot inspections. The quantity of rice arriving in recent days is indeed less than before, leading to soaring grain prices. The Food Administration Authorities are extremely concerned about this. Yesterday, they again summoned the Soy and Rice Industry Association and the Rice Brokerage Association to rush to print purchase certificates and distribute them to grain merchants to rush to various rice-producing areas to purchase rice with the certificates, in order to open up the rice source. According to the person in charge of the Soy and Rice Industry Association, the rice reserves in this city are extremely ample, and the private rice reserves alone amount to more than 700,000 to 800,000 stones.

The Shanghai Experimental Economic Farm has been designated to undertake the promotion work in Shanghai, and the detailed measures will be announced soon.

### British Tram Company Resumes Normal Operations; All Lines Running as Usual Yesterday; Labor and Management Awaiting Mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau; Sick Leave and Retirement Issues Resolved

[Report from This Newspaper] More than two hundred unemployed workers of the British Tram Company protested over the unresolved issue of reinstatement. In addition, over three thousand employed workers protested regarding the adjustment of base salaries and the management's refusal to implement the mediation record signed by both parties on January 30th. They staged a work slowdown the day before yesterday afternoon, with trams running but stopping ticket sales. After persuasion from Zhao Banfu, Director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, the workers agreed to wait for the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate. Therefore, starting yesterday, all tram lines resumed normal operations and are running as usual. The Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives from both labor and management for mediation at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning. Three representatives from management and eight representatives from labor, including six employed workers and two unemployed workers, attended. Director Zhao from the Labor Department, Section Chief Fan from the Mediation Section, and Consultant Wang from the bureau attended. The discussions were quite heated, lasting from 10 AM to 7:30 PM. During the meeting, Director Zhao reportedly left the meeting in anger over a certain issue. The Taishan Police Precinct dispatched a large number of police officers to the scene to maintain order. As a result of the late hour and the exhaustion of all parties after a day of discussion, only the issues of sick leave and retirement were resolved. Other issues, such as the adjustment of base salaries and the reinstatement of unemployed workers, were postponed for further discussion at 9 AM on the 13th. After the meeting, labor representatives went to the Shanghai North District Investigation Office of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters at 147 Weihaiwei Road to discuss unresolved issues with Section Chief Ma to find a solution. The Tram Company's industrial union issued notices overnight, urging workers to work peacefully, maintain transportation, and wait for further mediation.

The losses of the two stores are said to exceed 38 million yuan. The Taishan Precinct ordered police to the scene and arrested Li Kuaifa and eleven others involved in the violence for investigation.

### Illiterate Puppet Commissioner Wang Yongkang is a Complete "Rogue"; Claims He Didn't Run a Gambling Den and Wasn't Chu Ni's Godson; High Court Held Preliminary Hearing on Five Traitor Cases Yesterday Morning

[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday morning, the Special Criminal Court of the High Court, presided over by Judge Qiu Huaning, heard several cases of suspected traitors. Details are as follows:

Qian Nengxia

Thirty-six years old, from Qingpu, residing at 146 Danfeng Bridge, Nanjing. Formerly a staff member of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters. In the autumn of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), he joined a puppet organization and served as the Chief of the General Affairs Section of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters. In September of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), he was appointed as a Secretary with Simplified Appointment of the puppet Ministry of Transportation. In February of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he was appointed as a Secretary with Simplified Appointment of the puppet Ministry of Social Welfare. In April of the same year, he was reassigned as the Director of the Occupational Affairs Department of the same ministry. In June, he was transferred to be the Director of the General Affairs Department. In January of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), he was appointed as the Director of the puppet Nanjing Municipal Social Welfare Bureau. In April of the same year, he concurrently served as the Chairman of the puppet Nanjing Municipal Housing Mediation Committee. In July of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), he was appointed as the Director of the puppet Nanjing Municipal Economic Bureau. He is suspected of violating Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. Therefore, the High Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution. In court yesterday morning, Qian was wearing a black brocade gown and yellow leather shoes. His answers were like a speech, claiming he was an underground worker. Because he lost contact and was forced by circumstances, he took the last resort. Judge Qiu reprimanded him, asking why he betrayed his country and party since he was a member of the Kuomintang. Qian cleverly replied, "That's why I specialized in social welfare, serving the people."

Liu Weijun

Forty-four years old, from Changting, Fujian, residing at 100 Tianzhuang, Lane 608, Yuyuan Road. Graduated from the Economics Department of Tsinghua University in Peiping. Formerly a librarian at the Institute of Science of the Central Research Institute. In August of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), he was appointed as an Editor with Recommendation Appointment of the puppet Ministry of Finance. In the 28th year of the Republic (1939), he was promoted to be a member of the Tariff Commission of the puppet Ministry of Finance. In March of the 29th year of the Republic (1940), he was appointed as an Editor with Simplified Appointment of the Counselor's Office of the puppet Executive Yuan. In March of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), he was appointed as a Secretary with Designation Appointment of the puppet Economic Committee. In February of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he was promoted to be the Director of the General Affairs Department of the puppet Ministry of Construction. In October of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), he was reassigned as the Director of the Insurance Supervision Bureau of the puppet Ministry of Industry. In May of the same year, he was also appointed as the Director of the Fisheries Administration Bureau of the puppet Ministry of Industry. After the victory, he was arrested by military authorities. He appeared in court yesterday morning wearing a blue robe, cloth shoes, and a shaved head. He is a fat man. According to his statement, his joining the puppet government was entirely due to the pressure of life. He married early, had too many children, and his wife was sick. When he had no other choice, he borrowed money from Chen Jintao and was appointed to a puppet position. He also defended himself against the indictment on three points: (1) His translation of the British economist Keynes' "The Economic Consequences of the Peace" was at the behest of Chen Lianjintao, intending to deal with Japan's economic invaders, contrary to the indictment's claim of "seeking economic cooperation between China and Japan." (2) His article "China's Export Tax" was to commend President Song of the Executive Yuan for the export tax policy implemented in the 18th year of the Republic (1929) and to criticize the poor modifications of the tariff implemented in the 27th year of the Republic (1938). (3) The plan to oppress fishermen and prevent maritime guerrillas was due to a letter from the Fisheries Association stating that more than twenty taxes were levied on fish transported from Taihu to Shanghai, requesting protection. Therefore, this plan was made, but it was never approved by superiors and was never carried out to the detriment of fishermen.

Wang Yongkang

Fifty-one years old, from Shanghai, residing at 1, Lane 855, Xiafei Road, a shareholder of the China Trade Bank, formerly a specialist of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau of the puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and had opened the Yong'an Club gambling den. Wang is a burly man, wearing a dark green gown and black cloth shoes, and quite "roguish." According to his statement, he is illiterate and has little property. In March of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), through the introduction of Zhou Bangjun, he got to know Chu Minyi. To avoid the lack of freedom of movement during the blockade, Chu gave him the official position of specialist of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau of the puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but he never went to work. Judge Qiu asked him if he had拜褚民誼 as godfather, which he absolutely denied. As for the Yong'an gambling den, he said it was set up by Wang Aitang in August of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), with capital borrowed from him, but he did not declare the purpose in advance, so he demanded it back after half a year. Defense lawyer Huai Qun stood up and stated three points to the court: (1) The defendant surrendered himself, not arrested; (2) The defendant is illiterate and cannot actually be a puppet official. There are six or seven people with the same name as the defendant in Shanghai, fearing he has offended someone and been framed; (3) The gambling den was indeed not set up by the defendant, and the license can be checked. For the above three cases, the court ordered rescheduling for further hearing.

Then the court heard the cases of Zhu Ada and Cao Yaoting. Zhu was a rickshaw puller who translated for the enemy during the enemy occupation, taking advantage of his position to bully the people and commit many evils. He was arrested and punished after the victory. Witnesses Chen Shunzhi, Shen Jinsheng, Yang Maotou, Luo Yugen, Li Ziqi, Wang Qin'gen, Bao Rengui, and Xu Xinfu testified in court. In Cao Yaoting's case, since witnesses Wang Baoxun and Gao Yanmao had not arrived, after the presiding judge made a brief inquiry, both were ordered to be rescheduled for further hearing.

### Police Bureau Director Xuan Explains Establishment of "Police Management Zone" System; Preventing Bad Elements from Harming Society; Strengthening Police Efficiency to Ensure Public Security

[Report from This Newspaper] To clarify the truth about the "Police Management Zone" system and avoid misunderstandings, Xuan Tiewu, Director of the Shanghai Police Bureau, and Deputy Director Yu Shuping, invited reporters for a discussion at the Municipal Government Auditorium at 4 PM yesterday.

Responsible for a Certain Area

Director Xuan explained that the "Police Management Zone" system is a very ordinary police system and not a special event. Its purpose is to strengthen police work, improve the system, and make each police officer responsible for a certain area so that the public has greater assurance of public security. Outsiders do not understand the truth and are uneasy, believing that the police will freely enter and exit citizens' homes. In fact, police officers will not arbitrarily disturb citizens unless there is a special reason for inquiry. Police officers can currently conduct household visits if necessary, and this does not need to start after the implementation of the Police Management Zone system. According to explicit provisions of national laws and regulations, the police can be responsible for a portion of judicial work and have the right to arrest certain criminals in order to "truly guarantee the freedom of the people." According to Article 39 of the Regular Police Service Rules promulgated by the Ministry of Interior on March 4, 1930: "Patrolling police officers should clearly investigate the winding roads, narrow streets, accurate number of households, citizens' occupations, and economic conditions in their area." Article 40 also states: "For (1) those undergoing imprisonment, (2) those declared probation, (3) those with bad behavior, (4) those who are suddenly rich or poor, whose income is insufficient, (5) those with frequent customers and personnel changes, and (6) those with household changes in hotels and factories, they should be inspected at any time to prevent bad elements from harming society." Therefore, those who are good citizens have no reason to oppose it.

The Rong Case is Complex

Director Xuan also said that the environment in Shanghai today is very different from that in 1936 or 1937. At that time, there was no war and the order was not disrupted. Currently, there are many unemployed people in society, and public security is difficult due to the pressure of high prices, which is expected. In this process of transition from chaos to stability, the strength of maintaining public security should be at least twice as high as before the war, but the actual number of police officers is only eight thousand, which is only one-third of the pre-war number. From the beginning of Shanghai's takeover to March, robbery cases dropped from more than 140 to more than 80, but in April they increased to more than 100. The main reason is that prices are soaring and people cannot maintain their livelihoods. The bureau has tried its best to solve the cases. As for the Rong Desheng case, the situation is complex and different from ordinary cases. It is not yet certain whether it can be solved or when it will be solved.

The current equipment of the "Police Management Zone" system trains 500 people per period, five periods per year, at the Police Bureau Training Center, one period every two months, plus one month of practice. In order to improve the quality, excellent young people are recruited and given the title of police officer, appointed from the 16th grade according to the lowest treatment of police officers. Their duties are divided into administrative and criminal, mainly investigating households, registering personnel changes, and guarding against bandits. The area under the jurisdiction of each police officer is proportional to the number of households and police officers in the area. The current treatment of police officers has been changed to a total of 52,000 yuan starting in April. In addition to some new recruits who were recruited through exams, the rest were trained by the former patrol房 and received the education of that time, that is, the responsible branch offices stipulated two hours of training every day. Therefore, it is hoped that people in society will not have prejudices and despise police officers.

Regulations for Performer Registration

Regarding the registration of performers, Director Xuan stated that in Article 16 of the Municipal Government's "Regulations for the Management of Entertainment Venues in Shanghai," the police bureau should investigate the status and accurate number of performers to ensure their rights are guaranteed. There are no less than 10,000 performers in the city, among whom there are many excellent talents, but also many with bad behavior. The police bureau has the right to crack down. Issuing performer permits is not much different from issuing permits to lawyers, doctors, or identity cards. If there are those who consider themselves excellent and want to change the registration method, they can ask the police bureau to transfer it to the municipal government.

Numbered seating in cinemas is also to maintain order in public places. A few cinemas do not accept it and rise up in opposition, but the reasons they give seem insufficient. If there are losses, the bureau has agreed to request the municipal government to allow an additional showing each day to compensate. In fact, after the order is improved, it can only increase income and there is no reason for losses. After Xu Jiguang, Wang Xiaolai, and others requested a postponement, it has been granted. The prohibition of smoking in the venues is also quite unreasonable for some people to oppose. Public places filled with smoke are harmful to public health. The bureau has successively received many requests from citizens to strictly prohibit smoking in the venues. The work of prohibiting smoking and drugs is as important as maintaining public security. The bureau has long stipulated measures. Those who do not comply will be handed over to the court for investigation and punishment. More than 300 people have been handed over in January. If people report it, it will be strictly investigated and handled.

### Chen Dailun Stole a Jeep; It Happened Once Before; The Deceased's Father Went to the Police Bureau Yesterday to Handle the Corpse Collection; Bao An Tuan Members Picked Up Kangfu and Sent Him to the Garrison Headquarters

[Report] According to the Shanghai Vehicle Joint Inspection Office, Chen Dailun, the 16-year-old student who was shot and killed by police officers for stealing a jeep the day before yesterday, was found to have committed theft last Sunday after investigation. On that day, when the office sent personnel to patrol, they saw an ownerless jeep parked on Xin Zha Road. When they went to check it, just as they were about to drive it back to the office, Chen Dailun came out and argued, and showed the armband of the Bao An Tuan. Because Chen Dailun had no solid documents, the office impounded the car and did not take Chen to the bureau, only instructing him to provide documents to claim the car. Unexpectedly, a second car theft case occurred a few days later. It is also heard that the US military headquarters will consult with the garrison headquarters on how to resolve the matter of the US military police being shot and killed to seek a reasonable solution.

Threatened US Military Police to Shoot in the Middle of the Vital Parts

[Another Report] Regarding the case of US Navy Nelson being shot and killed by the young Chen Dailun, it is reported that when Nelson drove to the entrance of the Cao's Cemetery the day before yesterday, the perpetrator threatened Nelson with a gun to back up and turn around. At that time, Nelson reached back with his hand and raised his hat to signal for help to the military vehicle No. 41160 driving in front. Unexpectedly, Chen Dailun immediately fired three shots, hitting Nelson's chest and abdomen. When Chang fired a fourth shot at a Chinese military police officer sitting next to Nelson, fortunately, the military police officer was unusually alert and jumped out of the car, escaping the disaster. At the same time, three police officers in the military vehicle in front jumped out of the car. Police officer No. 8728 crouched under the south wall corner of the Cao's Cemetery and fired three shots at the vehicle where the perpetrator was sitting, one bullet hitting Chen's right side and piercing his left waist, killing him instantly. His father, Chen Shixia, went to the Longhua Police Bureau yesterday morning to handle the collection of the corpse. Bao An Tuan member Yao Kangfu (because the murder weapon came from Yao's place) has been transferred to the garrison headquarters.

### Jiang Gongmei's Case; Sentencing Expected Within Days

Regarding the case of Jiang Gongmei's corruption and illegal acts, the Military Affairs Commission previously ordered the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to handle the case strictly and report it. The headquarters organized a meeting for trial according to law and appointed Major General Li Shenzhi, a senior advisor of the Army Headquarters, as the presiding judge to preside over the joint trial. Subsequently, two evaluation meetings were held. The opinion of the police department was that Jiang was guilty of three major crimes: corruption, dereliction of duty, and embezzlement. Presiding Judge Li insisted that Jiang Gongmei's guilt was insufficient and should be declared innocent and submitted the case file to the Military Affairs Commission for review. The case has now been reviewed by the Military Affairs Commission, which believes that the original judgment was too hasty and that the investigation of the three parts of Jiang Gongmei's crimes of corruption, dereliction of duty, and embezzlement was not exhaustive. The commission returned the case for retrial. After receiving the order, the police department appointed Chief of Staff Tan Huanglin as the presiding judge, and Military Law Director Zeng Zhaoyi and Error Director Yang Jian as judges, and began the retrial on May 1. It is heard that the witness is being changed, evidence is being searched, and a judgment is expected to be made after the meeting within days and submitted to higher authorities for review.

### Starting From the 15th of This Month; Summer Time Will Be Implemented; Clocks Will Be Moved Forward One Hour

The Shanghai Municipal Government received a telegram from the Executive Yuan on May 10 stating: "Upon receiving a telegram from the National Defense Supreme Committee, summer has arrived this year. From May 15 to September 30, the time on the clock will be moved forward by one hour. For example, 7 o'clock now, after the implementation of the time advance system, the time indicated on the clock and the standard time reported by various places should be 8 o'clock. All agencies, troops, schools, and social, industrial, and commercial sectors, as well as land, sea, air transportation, and communications, should implement it uniformly, etc. Please follow this order and forward it for compliance." After receiving this telegram, the municipal government, in addition to ordering its subordinates to comply, also ordered the police to implement it on schedule and advance the city's standard time by one hour.

It is now known that the case has been scheduled for a public hearing at 9:30 AM on the 20th of this month at the North Zhejiang Road District Court. As for the lawsuit filed by lawyer Xia Gongkai and others against the Shanghai Municipal Government and its subordinate district offices, confirming the illegal election, since lawyer Xia and others have not yet specified the legal representatives of the district offices in the complaint, there has been no news of when the hearing will be held. If the above procedures are not completed within three days, the case will be dismissed.

### Bandits Not Only Steal Car, But Also Rob Driver of Valuables

[Our Dispatch] At around 7:00 PM the night before last, two customers, one dressed in a black Zhongshan suit and the other in a Western suit, arrived at the Zhongshan Automobile Company at No. 288, Zhongzheng 2nd Road, claiming to hire a car. Driver Mao Sanqin drove a Ford sedan, license plate number 20266, for business. When they reached Fuli Li Road, two more men in Western suits got on the car and ordered it to drive to the small vegetable market near Diswei Road in Hongkou. Upon arrival, they ordered the driver to stop and wait. Two of them went into the alley for over twenty minutes, then came back together, got back in the car, and headed back towards the intersection of Fuli Li Road and Beidang Road. Three of them got out, and soon only one got back in and instructed the driver to stop at the intersection of Mainini Road and Avenue Edward VII. The driver glimpsed the two who had just gotten out waiting by the side of the road, and they got back into the car together. Before they had gone far, the men pulled out firearms and forced Mao Sanqin to retreat into the back of the car, pushed him onto the seat, covered his eyes, and forbade him from making any noise. They robbed him of a watch and 20,000 yuan in legal tender. One bandit drove the car to the vicinity of Zhongshan Road and Caoxi Road, where they threw Mao Sanqin out of the car, and the car sped away. The driver reported the incident to the Longhua Police Station at 2:00 AM the next morning, but the car had not been found as of 9:00 PM that evening.

### Dispute Over Lixin Housing, Pan Xulun Expresses Position

Pan Xulun, President of Lixin Accounting College, made the following statement to our reporter regarding the college's reclaiming of the housing on Boussy Road: "After I donated the houses at Nos. 3, 4, 5, and 6, Lane 466, Boussy Road, to Lixin Accounting College, I no longer have any relationship with the current tenants in those houses. As for Lixin's lawsuit to reclaim the houses for its own use, it is all handled by the school board representing the college, and it is not my concern. It is true that the twenty or so tenants are finding it difficult to find new homes and relocate. However, in my personal capacity, I am unable to help. Recently, in addition to legal procedures, the tenants have published advertisements and news in major and minor newspapers, engaging in malicious publicity against me and the college, and much of the content is untrue. While I can certainly ignore this, the college has a large number of students and alumni, and the tenants' actions have damaged the college's reputation, inevitably arousing indignation among them. I can only urge the students to await a legal resolution peacefully. Since the tenants have already filed an appeal, I also hope they will await the court's judgment peacefully, without creating further complications outside the law, so as not to provoke the feelings of the youth."

### Impostors Using the Name of the Economic Bureau Arrested for Fraud

### New Invention by CU Professor, Suggest Expanding Research to Promote Success. Reader Suggests Eradicating Tuberculosis and Saving Patients' Families

Reader Suggests Eradicating Tuberculosis and Saving Patients' Families

To the Editor of the Social Services Column of Shen Bao: I read a news item on page 6 of your newspaper regarding a Taipei dispatch on the 4th, learning that Dr. Chen Lijie and others from National Taiwan University have discovered that laevorotatory lactic acid extracted from cypress wood is an effective drug for pulmonary disease. Upon hearing this, I could not help but feel elated. I believe that the rampant spread of pulmonary disease is extremely severe in our country, which is economically poor and has backward medical and health conditions. The large number of patients, the high mortality rate, the enormous economic costs, and the suffering of patients confined to their beds are all well known to the public and need no further elaboration. The seriousness of this problem is truly related to the wealth and strength of the country. Now that this invention has been discovered domestically, it must not be regarded as a local undertaking. It is appropriate to mobilize national research institutions, scientific and medical personnel to conduct joint research and strive to achieve excellence, in order to recover the huge losses caused by this disease. The central government has an unshirkable responsibility to encourage and supervise. Your newspaper, as a leader in the news industry, should inform its correspondents of such important issues, disseminate the detailed information of the new invention to the world, and awaken the attention of people across the country and the interest of scientific and medical personnel. The merits of this initiative will be abundant. I wonder if you agree? Respectfully, Shen Jiaxian, a reader, May 7, 35.

### Southwest Associated University Erects Stone Tablet at Original Site in Kunming to Commemorate, Professor Feng Youlan Writes Text, Professor Luo Yong Pens Script, Professor Wen Yiduo Carves Seal

[Kunming Dispatch by Wood] After the graduation ceremony on the 4th of this month, Southwest Associated University erected a commemorative stone tablet at the original school site in Kunming. The tablet is stone-carved, with the text written by Professor Feng Youlan, the script penned by Professor Luo Yong, and the seal carved by Professor Wen Yiduo. The original text is more than a thousand words long. Here is an excerpt:

Southwest Associated University Commemorative Tablet - Full Text

On September 9, the 34th year of the Republic of China, our country accepted the surrender of Japan in Nanjing. This was eight years after the July 7th Incident at Lugou Bridge in the 26th year, fourteen years after the September 18th Incident in Shenyang, and fifty-one years after the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu. In the fifty years, Japan had devoured and nibbled at our country. Now all these territories were restored with documents, achieving a complete victory unprecedented since the Qin and Han dynasties. National Peking University and National Tsinghua University were originally located in Beiping. Nankai University was originally located in Tianjin. Since the Shenyang Incident, our country's authority gradually shifted south, but these three schools were the backbone of the cultural resistance against Japan in Peiping and Tianjin. When Peiping and Tianjin fell in the 26th year, the three schools were ordered to move to Hunan, forming the National Changsha Provisional University, with the presidents of the three schools, Jiang Menglin, Mei Yiqi, and Zhang Boling, as standing committee members in charge of school affairs. The faculties of science, engineering, and law were set up in Changsha, and the faculty of arts in South Yue, with classes starting on November 1. When Nanking and Shanghai fell and Wuhan was shaken, the Provisional University was again ordered to move to Yunnan. Teachers and students walked through Guizhou and arrived in Kunming on April 26 in the 27th year, and was then ordered to be renamed as the National Southwest Associated University. The faculty of science and engineering was located in Kunming, and the faculties of arts and law in Mengzi, with classes starting on May 4. After one semester, the faculties of arts and law also moved to Kunming. In the 27th year, a teachers college was added, and in the 29th year, a branch school was established in Xuyong, Sichuan. After one academic year, it was merged into the main campus. Kunming was originally a famous rear city, but when Japanese troops entered Annam and occupied Burma, it became an important rear base. The Associated University supported the region, graduating more than 2,000 students, and more than 800 joined the military. With the restoration of the country, the wartime mission of the Associated University was completed, and it was ordered to disband on May 4 in the 35th year. The original three schools would return to their old homes and resume their former operations. Recalling the hardships of eight years of support and the harmony of the three schools' cooperation, there are four things to commemorate: Our country, as an ancient country in the world, is located in the treasure trove of East Asia and should inherit the legacy of the Han and Tang dynasties and become a pioneer in benefiting the world. In the future, when the country is built, it will occupy a unique position in world history. The powerful nations of the world, though new, are not ancient, and Greece and Rome are ancient but not modern. Only our country is both ancient and modern, both new and old. This is what is meant by "Though Zhou is an old country, its mandate is ever new." The great cause of an era, the eight-year war of resistance, has opened its scale and laid its foundation. Today's victory has the power to reverse the course of the world for our country, and the mission of the Associated University ends with the war of resistance. This is the first thing to commemorate. Scholars have always looked down on each other, and the ancients have said so, which we share today. The three schools have different histories and different academic styles. For eight years, they cooperated seamlessly, with tolerance and mutual benefit. The five colors shone together, enhancing each other. The eight tones harmonized, ending in peace and harmony. This is the second thing to commemorate. All things grow together without harming each other, and paths proceed in parallel without conflicting with each other. Small virtues flow like streams, and great virtues cultivate. This is why heaven and earth are great. This is the true essence of democracy. The Associated University, with its spirit of inclusiveness, shifted the atmosphere of society, establishing a model of academic freedom internally and earning the title of a democratic fortress externally. It rejected the acquiescence of the many and acted as the blunt remonstrance of one. This is the third thing to commemorate. Looking back at history, if our nation cannot stand in the Central Plains, it will only be able to settle in the south. Although it is called crossing south, no one who crosses south has been able to return north: The Jin people crossing south are one example, the Song people crossing south are another example, and the Ming people crossing south are a third example. The scenery is not different, but the Jin people were deeply grieved, and the Song people deeply desired to recover the land. We were the fourth south crossing, but we were able to achieve complete recovery in less than ten years. Yu Xin did not mourn Jiangnan, and Du Fu rejoiced at the recovery of Jibei. This is the fourth thing to commemorate. The original school song of the Associated University praised the hardships of moving south and fleeing from the hardships, praised the unyielding ambition of teachers and students, and ended with the hope of final victory. The success of the school today is consistent with its original intentions, just like a contract. The beginning and end of the Associated University is not just a great event of an era, but something that will be admired for centuries to come. Therefore, we use the lyrics of the song as the inscription on the tablet, saying: "Grieving for crossing south, bid farewell to the palaces, station in Hengxiang, then depart again, embark on a long march, pass through hardship, look at the Central Plains, everywhere stained with blood, reach the distant, continue lecturing, weeping over poetry and books, still have the ancients, although the reed pipe blows, the emotions are deeper, the shame of the millennium, finally wiped away, see the enemy, like smoke disappears, rising from the north, until south of Vietnam, seeing the golden cup, already without defect, great unification, without collapse, the cause of revival, pursuing past achievements, the three schools, brothers in a line, as one body, like glue, sharing hardships, rejoicing together, the alliance ends, the mission is completed, the capital is restored, return to Yanjing, with this stone, symbolizing steadfastness, commemorate the happiness, tell the wise."

### Students of the Preparatory Class of the Capital Temporary University, The Problem of Admission Solved, Vice Minister Hang Addresses the Class, All Students Express Gratitude

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Paper] Hundreds of students in the preparatory class of the Capital Temporary University, for the problem of admission, specially delegated several representatives to go to the Ministry of Education on the 8th to petition. The students requested that the majority be guaranteed admission, but the Ministry of Education stated that there were regulations in place and could not fully comply with the students' requests. The problem could not be solved on that day. At 2:00 PM on the 9th, Vice Minister Hang Liwu of the Ministry of Education went to the auditorium of National Central University at Sipailou to address the entire class of students.

Continuing Classes for Two Weeks After the 17th Examination

He first said: After the end of World War II, our country, along with the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, were demobilizing their armies, adjusting their governments, and engaging in recuperation and reconstruction. Only by maintaining peace and rebuilding could we ensure prosperity. Therefore, after the victory, the Ministry of Education sought to restore the studies of outstanding young people in the recovery areas and petitioned the Executive Yuan for funding to run the preparatory class for the Temporary University, in order to educate talents and become national pillars. The students, being nurtured and expected by the country, should concentrate on their studies. If they have any opinions on their future studies, they can submit them through the school authorities or in writing. They should not gather to run around, but cherish the precious time in class and avoid causing misunderstandings to the outside world. He continued: Central University's staff and students are advancing by land and water, and 4,000 people will come to Nanking within the current month. Therefore, the preparatory class had to end early. After the examination on the 17th, classes can continue for another two weeks to supplement knowledge.

Fifty Percent Can Be Guaranteed Admission to National University

Regarding the admission methods for preparatory class students, it was said that they would be handled in the same way as the admission methods for preparatory class students in the rear (25% of students who had been admitted for one semester would pass the entrance exam, and 50% of students who had been admitted for two semesters would pass the entrance exam). (It was found that the class had already held the first examination because the course was intensified, and it would end at the end of May, so the 50% pass method could be followed). Fifty percent could be guaranteed admission to National University, but the main subjects of liberal arts students must have a score of 70 or higher, and the main subjects of science students in mathematics, physics, and chemistry must have a score of 70 or higher to be eligible for guaranteed admission. After Vice Minister Hang finished his speech, all the students expressed their gratitude unanimously. All showed their admiration for the Vice Minister's great concern for the students. (Morning)

Various speculative funds poured in, and prices rose after the opening, once approaching 1.7 million around 10 o'clock. However, prices then fell back due to various sell-offs and pressure from the Central Bank, dropping back to around 1.67 million. The Central Bank then allocated 701 bars to the industry at that price. After the allocation was completed, speculative activity resumed. The stock market also had some coverage. Near noon, prices gradually rose to just below 1.72 million before seeing a pullback. Many were shaken by the Central Bank's pressure, and some took profits. At noon, prices fell back to around 1.68 million. In the afternoon, Tianjin merchants continued to buy. In the end, prices remained above the 1.7 million mark. As a result, the closing price rose by 125,000 compared to the previous day. Ornament gold was listed at 183,000. Silver ingots and silver dollars were flat. Interest rates showed a loose money supply. Shadow interest rates retreated to 1.5 to 1.8 cents.

The US dollar was purely driven by gold prices, following suit closely. From the opening price of 2210 yuan in the morning, it gradually rose to 2350 yuan. Prices fell back to within 2300 yuan at noon. Due to the passive nature of the market, swap spreads opened up to above 735 yuan. In the afternoon, prices were still slightly driven up by gold prices. As a result, the closing price rose by 120 yuan compared to the previous day. The Hong Kong dollar market was volatile, with limited funds. Prices once rose to above 420 yuan. In the end, prices closed up 20 yuan. Hong Kong exchange rates were 415 yuan to 425 yuan. Rubles were traded at 525 yuan.

### Yarn Prices Rise in Unison, Raw Cotton Trading Declines

Yesterday, the yarn market became stable due to the sudden rise in gold prices, which boosted people's morale considerably. In the early morning, all yarn prices rose in unison, especially 42-count doubled yarn. Because the Textile Construction Company listed prices yesterday without any supply, the same industry's thoughts rose sharply. Blue Phoenix once traded at 1.93 to 1.94 million. The closing price fell slightly to 1.93 million, but still rose by 100,000 compared to yesterday. The remaining 20-count yarn rose by about 10,000, and 16-count yarn rose by 20,000. Transactions were very scarce.

Yesterday, the New York cotton telegram reported a decline of 12 to 29 pounds. The near-term US dollar was 27.40, the long-term was 27.53, and the Middling spot price was 28.07. Raw cotton trading in this port declined because it was Saturday. Although the gold and cloth markets were booming, manufacturers were watching and waiting, with no inquiries. Only the same industry made some embellishments.

### Textile Construction Company Sells Off as Much as Possible, Rayon Prices Look Weak, Factory-Made Silk Fabrics All Rise

Yesterday, the rayon market did not make any price due to the Textile Construction Company's opening of goods. Outside the market, No. 120 Tianqiao shouted a price of 1.33 million yuan. The opening prices of the Central Textile Company were 1.07 million yuan for No. 120 Peacock Earth, 1.12 million yuan for No. 120 Silver Bird, and 1.21 million yuan for No. 150 Golden Three Horses. The prices for bright and semi-bright were the same. More than 200 rayon companies opened more than 600 boxes in total. It is said that the Central Textile Company opens goods once every Saturday. After this, rayon market prices may be difficult to look good. There were not many factory-made transactions. Due to the rise in gold prices, user silk prices all rose by about 50,000 yuan. The silk fabric market was quite active yesterday. Dachang checkered crepe rose by 100 yuan per yard. Meiya quilts also rose by 120,000 yuan per 100 pieces.

### Tobacco Leaf Supply is Smooth

[This newspaper dispatch] More than 2,000 barrels of American tobacco leaves were imported this week. Dalian and Qingdao in China have received large quantities of shipments. The Jiangxin ship also arrived from Hankou the day before yesterday, carrying more than 2,440 pieces of tobacco leaves, 360 pieces of mechanical cotton, and 860 pieces of yellow and white linen. A large amount of miscellaneous grain was also shipped to Shantou. The China Merchants Bureau Hai Min ship will depart today, sailing to Xiamen and Shantou, carrying 33,300 pieces of bean cakes, more than 1,470 bags of soybeans, 885 pieces of peanut cakes, more than 28,400 bags of bran, more than 500 bags of fertilizer powder, 250 pieces of tobacco leaves, 350 pieces of cotton yarn, and 80 pieces of piece goods to Shantou. It will also carry 3,000 pieces of bean cakes, 100 bags of soybeans, and 185 pieces of cotton yarn to Xiamen.

### Tea Market Trading Declines

Recently, Tianjin merchants have once again shown interest in new Hangzhou Qiang teas. In order to facilitate selection, it is heard that the merchants will soon go to the production area to absorb them. As for Wenzhou Qiang teas, the supply from the source is still continuous. However, the quality is getting lower and lower, so the market continues to be unsustainable. Currently, the price has fallen by nearly 140,000 yuan per dan, but some owners are still eager to sell off. Therefore, sales are also made at 120,000 to 130,000 yuan. Since the buying interest from all parties has progressed continuously, other varieties have reached a considerable level. Therefore, those who inquire have become more and more few. However, the holders' thoughts are not discouraged, so their base remains firm.

### Public Bonds Gradually Decline; Stock Market Greatly Weakened

The public bond market situation is bewildering. Some financial institutions released their high-priced inventory, and large investors turned around and let go. The "Unified C" bond gradually declined from 75.50 yuan. Northern capital flowed towards gold, breaking the 65.00 yuan mark midway before gradually stabilizing. It closed 400 yuan lower than the previous closing. Grades A and B fell 550 yuan, Grade D fell 600 yuan, and Grade E fell 650 yuan. Chinese stocks, like startled birds, found it difficult to recover their vitality in the short term. Furthermore, with the fluctuating gold market, floating capital scattered. At the opening, some promise was shown, with Wing Spinning at 53.80 yuan, Mei Ya at 45.00 yuan, Jingfu at 3.75 yuan, New Guang at 3.15 yuan, and Qin Xing at 2.80 yuan, but then they could not sustain the momentum. Near noon, Wing Spinning fell to 49.00 yuan, Mei Ya to 40.50 yuan, Jingfu to 3.40 yuan, New Guang to 2.85 yuan, and Qin Xing to 2.40 yuan. Rong Feng, which had reigned supreme for several days, also found it difficult to maintain its position at 13.40 yuan, ending the morning session with a half-percent decline. After a weak noon session, there was a slight rebound. The final results, compared to the previous close, showed Wing Spinning, Mei Ya, Jingfu, and New Guang each down half a percent, while Qin Xing fell slightly less than one percent. Except for small stocks, which remained stable, most unpopular stocks declined slightly. Foreign stocks completely assimilated with Chinese stocks. Yi Spinning initially struggled above the previous closing price, but securities firms were unable to support it, and popular stocks were the first to collapse. Unpopular stocks were also dragged down. Near noon, low prices appeared across the board. As a result, all stocks fell by about half a percent compared to the previous close. The paper industry was already cold and musty; once holders were eager to sell, market prices immediately dropped by slightly less than twenty percent.

### Cotton Cloth Industry and Textile Construction Agree on Improvement Measures; Open for Business as Usual Starting Tomorrow

The cotton cloth market operated as usual yesterday. Textile Construction was scheduled to open for the sale of cloth yesterday, but although price lists were posted as usual, no cloth merchants went to place orders. According to news from the Cotton Cloth Association, its responsible persons continued discussions with the responsible persons of Textile Construction yesterday, and agreed on the following: (1) Opening for business should strive for universality and fairness; Textile Construction should immediately compile statistics for constant reference to ensure appropriate distribution. (2) The order collection time should be appropriately extended to avoid insufficient time for processing. (3) Staff should be added to the order and allocation departments to provide convenience to customers. (4) Inventory management should be centralized to ensure prompt and appropriate calculation of supply and demand. (5) The problem of delayed tax bills and multiple households signing a single bill should be addressed by Textile Construction with the Commodity Tax Bureau for improvement. (6) Opening procedures should be continuously improved. The responsible persons of both the Association and Textile Construction will maintain contact in the future. Based on the results of these discussions, the Association has issued a notice to all members, stating that starting on Monday, the 13th, the Textile Construction opening will resume as usual. It is heard that some directors of the Association have expressed their intention to resign, which is likely to happen. As for the distribution offices of Textile Construction, the Association will also initiate an organization to provide operational convenience to all industry peers and brokers, so that everyone can share the benefits.

### Canada's Foreign Loans; China Accounts for 60 Million

[Reuter's Ottawa, 11th] According to US dollars (excluding Britain), China accounts for one hundred and sixty million US dollars. A list is issued below regarding the amount and term of the loans: (Unit: Millions of US Dollars)

### Trends in World Gold and Silver Prices; Although US Authorities Exert All Efforts to Prevent Rises; Popular Belief Likely to Follow, Square Market

[Reuter's London, 11th] According to a Reuter's reporter, knowledgeable gold industry figures here firmly believe that the prices of sterling and the dollar against gold and silver will rise to higher levels in Europe and the East, especially silver. As far as gold is concerned, once the price rises, it will be a devaluation of sterling and the dollar. US and British authorities have not yet taken steps to do so. The US gold price is set at $35 an ounce, and the sterling-dollar exchange rate is also fixed, so the sterling price of gold, at 172 shillings and 3 pence, clearly cannot rise except for slight adjustments.

The US Treasury's opposition to raising the price of gold may stem similar trends elsewhere, but when the US faces its future recession (which most observers believe is only a matter of time), fears of current inflation turning into deflation may change things entirely. A senior official at the US Treasury, involved in the Bretton Woods monetary agreement, also opposes raising the price of gold, arguing that "the US Treasury believes that future changes in the dollar against gold should be based on the principles stipulated in the Bretton Woods Agreement," rather than the reason that there should be no changes in the price of gold. Although the official price of silver in London is currently set at 44 pence per ounce, its "free market" price is 58 to 60 pence per ounce. Recently, the free market price reached a peak of 68 pence per ounce. Although it has not yet reached Eastern levels, the upward trend suggests it is not far off.

### Lightest Woolen Fabric; Weighs Only One Ounce Per Yard

British Information Service, London, 11th - A manufacturer in London has produced the lightest woolen fabric, weighing only one ounce per yard. It was invented by research staff in Leeds: using a seaweed-based thread as a guide thread, folded together with pure wool; this seaweed guide thread dissolves in a mild alkaline solution. After weaving, once washed, it leaves the purest woolen fabric. The woolen fabric made with this new method has unprecedentedly beautiful drape, structure, and form, and its future development is unpredictable. Unfortunately, current production is not high, and it cannot yet be exported.

### Wusong Fishing Season; Dense Masts at Wenzaobang

The spring yellow croaker market in Wusong is a major business for the local area. During this period, the market is twice as lively. The first batch of fishing boats have arrived successively over the past two days, totaling more than 150, so the masts in Wenzaobang are densely packed. After completing customs inspection and tax payment procedures, unloading began in the afternoon yesterday for sales ashore. This year, there are about 20 fish merchants for resale, including Xiexinggong, Baofeng, Tongli, Gongdaxiang, and Hengtai. The opening price for yellow croaker is 42,000 yuan per zu, and dried fish is 74,000 yuan per dan. Merchants from various inland areas are actively coming to Song to purchase goods, and hotels are fully booked.

### Japanese and Italian Raw Silk Expand to the US

[Reuter's Tokyo, 11th] Nine thousand bales of Japanese raw silk of all grades are scheduled to arrive in the United States in May.

[Reuter's Milan, 10th] The export of Italian raw silk has gradually returned to normal. In the first 20 days of March, Italy exported a total of 713,921 kilograms of raw silk, of which the United States received 242,221 kilograms, Argentina 4,800 kilograms, the United Kingdom 500 kilograms, and Switzerland 466,400 kilograms.

### The More Anxious People Become, The More Urgent Their Needs; Rice Prices Continue to Rise; How Can The Poor Survive! It is Heard That Grain Loans Are Decided to Be Temporarily Ended

Yesterday, the rice market was very active, with supply falling short of demand. Japonica and indica rice continued to rise by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, approaching the 50,000 yuan mark. Flour from Shantou and Xiamen was selling quite well, soaring by 2,000 yuan. Soybeans also rose by more than 2,000 yuan due to inquiries from Fujian and Zhejiang. Bean cakes, purchased by merchants from Nanyang, also rose by 500 to 600 yuan. Bran, selling well in rural areas, continued to rise by 400 to 500 yuan. Raw peanuts also increased by 1,000 yuan. Red beans, active but not strong in Hong Kong, rose by 1,000 yuan. Red sorghum rose by 1,000 yuan. The oil market, with strong domestic demand and inquiries from Ningbo merchants, rose another 2,000 yuan. According to the rice market, yesterday's rice arrivals in this city totaled more than 2,700 shi, with the following types and quantities: White japonica 1,210, sheep indica 245, thin rice 425, Du indica 388, early rice 443.

Furthermore, due to the imposition of military grain collection restrictions on the export of rice in Kunshan, Suzhou, Changshu, Wuxi, and other rice-producing areas along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, the rice market in this city has been agitated and broke through the 50,000 yuan mark yesterday. Vice Minister of Food Pang Songzhou made a special trip from Beijing to Shanghai to convene food merchants to discuss and determine emergency measures to stabilize rice prices. First, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will send giant transports to Vietnam to load 200,000 tons of foreign rice to Shanghai. At the same time, the Bean and Rice Industry Association will be allowed to freely purchase from the Beijing-Shanghai rice-producing areas based on the certificates issued, and the purchased rice will be limited to public sale in the market. It is heard that the first phase of grain loan rice, 30,000 zu, has already been shipped to Shanghai, and 5,000 dan were sold yesterday morning. Together with the 9,000 dan sold previously, a total of 14,000 zu have been sold. The rest will be sold in succession. This period of grain loan rice will be temporarily ended, and all loans will be recovered to avoid misunderstandings. The distribution of the profit surplus from the grain loan rice is still awaiting consideration and decision by the Chamber of Commerce.

It was previously rumored that the Qinglian Pavilion rice market on Fourth Malu Road would restore north-south market transactions. According to the rice market, there is no possibility of change for the time being, because the north-south rice markets were concentrated sales areas for rice from Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, Kunshan, and other rice-producing areas in Jiangsu Province before the war, and they have been destroyed by Japanese artillery fire and are not easy to repair and restore to their original state.

Letters to the Editor

### Questions Regarding Commodity Tax and Nutrition Tax; Explanation from the Jiangsu Commodity Tax Bureau

To the Editor, I recently read the article "Commodity Tax and Business Tax Issues in the Dyeing and Weaving Industry" written by Mr. Zhu Shangyi, published in your newspaper on the 6th of this month. The explanation of tax principles is detailed and precise, which is sufficient to dispel public doubts. However, the last paragraph of this article, regarding the current collection of unified tax on cotton yarn and export declaration procedures, slightly deviates from the facts. Our Bureau is responsible for tax administration and cannot remain silent. The following is a brief description based on the provisions of the regulations:

(1) The current unified tax on cotton yarn is levied on cotton yarn at the factory, calculated according to the approved unified tax price. Cotton cloth was originally exempt from tax. However, because larger yarn factories often have weaving workshops attached, the raw materials used are all taken from the factory itself. Since this yarn for weaving is not moved outside the factory, it should not be taxed according to the principle of factory tax. Therefore, the current regulations for collecting unified tax on cotton yarn stipulate that when cotton yarn is transferred from the spinning workshop to the weaving workshop in yarn factories with weaving workshops attached, the unified tax will not be collected temporarily. After the yarn is made into woven products and packaged for leaving the factory, the unified tax will be supplemented on the woven products. The tax standard is also specified, and the tax will be collected ad valorem according to the weight of the yarn content. Tax authorities have always handled matters in accordance with the regulations, and there have never been any extra levies. However, in order to make the cargo correspond to the certificate, the name of the commodity is filled in as "cotton cloth" in the product name column of the tax certificate, which generally misleads people to think that the unified tax on cotton cloth is collected. They do not know that it is actually a supplementary tax on yarn. As for the woven products produced by pure weaving factories, since their raw materials are already taxed cotton yarn, there is also a method for pure weaving factories to exchange their finished products directly woven from cotton yarn for transport permits. With the original cotton yarn tax payment certificate or distribution certificate, the number of woven finished products that can be produced can be exchanged for a pure weaving factory cotton yarn directly woven finished product transport permit for transportation. There is no fee and no additional unified tax on cotton cloth is levied.

(2) The methods for collecting taxes and issuing certificates for the woven products produced by each factory have been described above. Therefore, anyone holding these goods should transport them with a certificate, and the same applies when declaring for export. For those who report for transportation in whole batches, they can immediately present the original tax certificate or transport permit for inspection. If they are transported in separate batches, they can hold the original tax certificate or transport permit and apply to the local tax authorities for a distribution permit (the distribution permit method is still the same) before submitting it for verification. However, the reporting location must be consistent with the destination filled on the certificate to avoid ambiguity. This method has been in place for many years and has not been inconvenient.

The above two points are the actual situation regarding cotton cloth in the current cotton yarn unified tax laws and regulations, which is inconsistent with what you learned from rumors in the article. I am afraid that readers will not understand and cause misunderstandings, so I specially wrote a letter to clarify and hope that your newspaper will publish it in the letters to the editor column to clarify the truth. Thank you very much.

### Weeping as He Recounts That Taiwan Has Been Mute for Fifty Years; Now Reveals Shadows of The Past

— Twilight Clouds, Our Correspondent in Taiwan Via Air Mail on The 5th

Just as what is displayed in the Taipei Provincial Museum, Taipei City was once a desolate market town fifty years ago. At the end of the late Qing Dynasty, the urban area was purely Southern Chinese indigenous architecture with mud roads and rubble. However, fifty years later, Taipei has leapt to become a modern and new-style city. In between, the trajectory of development from an ancient city to a darling of the times can be traced. One hundred and twenty years ago, the popular Taiwanese proverb was: "First Tainan Prefecture, second Lugang, third Mengjia." This means that the most prosperous was Tainan Prefecture, followed by Lugang, and then Mengjia. Mengjia, a collection and distribution point for ships relying on the Tamsui River, is Taipei City's Wanhua, and still retains ancient shadows. People strolling in the urban area can catch a glimpse of the city wall surrounded by betel nut trees at the end of the wide asphalt roads. That is the site of the city wall that took two years to complete after the Imperial Commissioner Shen Baozhen, during the reign of Qing Emperor Guangxu, memorialized that the Taiwan Prefecture be moved from Taichung to Taipei, and Prefect Chen Xingju raised 200,000 taels of silver. The one-mile perimeter was dismantled by the Japanese to build wide roads. Now, the four city gates - Jingfu Gate (East Gate), Lizheng Gate (South Gate), Chengen Gate (North Gate), and Chongxi Gate (Small South Gate) - have smiling faces as the May wind blows. The Japanese never thought that this monument, which touched national sentiments, would trigger a huge wave of resistance.

The reporter interviewed local elders, who frequently recounted the events of fifty-one years ago, and tearfully traced the suffering experienced during the long nights. As soon as they closed their eyes, it was as if they were standing in front of the Prefect they had seen in their youth, with a red-tasselled hat, a string of beads in front of his chest, court attire, and a dignified and stern face. They loved to watch the court sessions and the trials of prisoners, and they also loved to watch the scenery when the drums and gongs, flag-bearers, umbrella-bearers, and bearers carrying the large sedan chair passed by when leaving the yamen.

Thirty years ago, they had been to Japan, as well as to Shanghai, Nanjing, Hong Kong and other places in China. They did not believe that China's science was inferior to theirs at that time, but that education was not widespread due to internal unrest. The biggest pain they felt was the difference in treatment by the Japanese towards the Taiwanese during the fifty years of occupation. In addition to being loyal to personal duties, they did not help or ask about external affairs. Six million people were like mutes, unable to complain about their suffering or speak their minds under high-pressure control. They said: The Japanese in Taiwan used forceful means and the qualifications of bandits to build. The warlords and traitors have buried their motherland. If they do not give up imperialism and remain hegemonic and incorrigible, it will be difficult to revive even after twenty years.

Having been mutes for fifty years in the face of reality, the elderly who are now speaking up said: In the early stages, it is inevitable to seek comprehensiveness. In short, there are gentlemen and villains everywhere. If the Taiwanese have the ambition to look at the vastness of the world, why should they limit themselves to serving in Taiwan? They are sixty-four years old this year, with ancestral roots in Zhangzhou, and come from a scholarly family. They can recite the Four Books and Five Classics, and can also write pure literary Chinese. They said that the Taiwanese will not forget the national language. The Japanese promoted the national language here for thirty years before it became popular, but the Minnan dialect still cannot be eliminated. Even in their own case, they learned the national language for six months when they went to the mainland, and after a decade or two, they can now review and learn anew and are able to cope with it.

Under the ancient city walls, we discovered true patriots who spent their youth in tears. The second generation seems to have forgotten them. But the reporter thinks that it is necessary to strive for and resonate with those who respect the elderly. Only they understand the country best, and also understand Taiwan best. The vigorous shadow is precisely the only vitality left on the ground.

### Taipei Night Flute

— Our Correspondent in Taiwan Via Air Mail

The night in Taipei City is exactly the opposite of the daytime, carrying the coolness of early autumn. Indoors, nestled in a small room, one can smell the fragrance of jasmine and the osmanthus flowers of August. On the quiet streets, you can hear the sounds of wooden clogs with Japanese customs, occasionally mixed with the night songs of flutists (i.e., masseuses), whose tones are heart-stirring. They will stir up homesickness in travelers who have traveled across the ocean, they are male and female blind people looking for food for tomorrow on the fringes of life.

The bustling street that controls Taipei's economic lifeline is Dadaocheng (now the area around Yanping Road). As the lights come on, the sound of guessing games and orders from restaurants, mixed with the laughter of women under the pressure of life, wafts over. People will exchange all their income for the price of a laugh that they can afford; if not, they go to one of the three dance halls and pay thirty yuan to dance ten dances, holding the waist of a local dancer wearing a tall cheongsam. People from the mainland say that it is too boring to come to Taiwan, the economic foundation cannot be established, life feels pitiful, there is no future for a career, so why not find some stimulation. More than fifty dancers and tens of thousands of waitresses are forced to make a half-laughing life under the pressure of life. The deformed prosperity of the night has grown, like the crazy scene during the war.

In fact, the most mysterious and seductive is Mengjia. In the past, Mengjia was a collection and distribution point for junks carrying camphor, tea and other local products. The towering masts and the merchants coming and going intertwined to form the prosperous face of this street along the banks of the Tamsui River. This is the base camp of the Han Chinese from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in Fujian. Mengjia's coat is draped in the dazzling and seductive color of mystery, but at the bottom, it is full of a pure Chinese ancient flavor. In the back streets, in the small South Chinese-style pigeon coops, the gods and Buddhas they believe in include the famous Longshan Temple, Zushi Temple, and Mazu Temple of Tianhou Temple, etc., and the incense fires are endless throughout the year. Under the dim electric lights at night, you can see the backs of girls dragging wooden clogs, carrying small bags, and smiling sadly as they return home lazily. At the same time, you can also find devout men and women burning incense, lighting candles, and kowtowing in temples late at night; especially Nengshan Temple, a famous temple built in the third year of Qianlong, has become a spiritual place for the people of this province. When you first come here, it is difficult for you to believe that this is already more than a thousand miles overseas from Jiangnan, because the mood is no different from that of Xuanmiao Temple in Suzhou and Chenghuang Temple in Shanghai.

Wandering here, you will believe that this is a manifestation of the deep potential of the Chinese nation! The Japanese have ruled Taiwan for so many years, and they have squeezed the flesh and blood of the islanders, but they have not taken away their hearts. In the old styles of life and houses, people feel how much the Japanese looked down on the people of this province!

In the area near Nengshan Temple and the Tamsui River, summer is an excellent place to escape the heat. You can call for a boat, float on the river, and greet the cool night breeze, letting go of the noise of the city. But now there are prostitutes selling smiles, waiting for people looking for physical comfort in the black curtain of the night. Thousands of local women are now secretly prostituting themselves under the iron whip of life. They are scattered in the low corners of houses, leaving traces of past romances, Japanese geisha houses...

The short flute of the blind is played in turn, like a New Year's Eve serenade, and the sad melody tells the high-altitude life of lament. The people of ancient China are eagerly awaiting the dawn after liberation! Daybreak!

### The Grain-Producing Area Eats Vegetables for Meals! The Grain Shortage in Hunan is Becoming Increasingly Severe

— Special Dispatch from Our Changsha Correspondent, Gao Yuanli

The severity of the disaster in Hunan has been reported to readers by this newspaper several times. Recently, the price of grain in Changsha has risen by 20,000 yuan per stone, causing social unrest. The situation in various counties has worsened, leading to frequent reports of people being forced to commit suicide by drowning or hanging. Even in Changde, a grain-producing area, people are eating vegetables for meals, and the city is filled with starving people, creating a dire situation. If effective relief is not provided quickly, the situation will become unmanageable.

Wishful Thinking Was Not Accurate Enough

The serious grain situation in Hunan has long been recognized by all parties, but relying on the idea of "relying on heaven for food," no concrete measures have been taken. From mid-March to mid-April, the grain price remained stable, and there were several rains, raising the river water level by several feet. The rice price remained around 29,000 yuan, not exceeding 20,000 yuan, so everyone felt relieved. Former Chairman Wu Qiwu brought news from Chongqing that 400,000 stones of surplus grain from Sichuan and Jiangxi would be used to aid Hunan. Furthermore, approval was obtained for the Joint Treasury to issue 500 million yuan in grain loans to Hunan and 1 billion yuan in agricultural loans. In addition, the purchase price of military grain was increased. With this series of good news, everyone thought there was a solution and that the grain price would fall. So everyone waited for the surplus grain from Sichuan and Jiangxi to arrive, thinking the problem would be solved. Little did they know that their wishful thinking was wrong, and the grain price fluctuated sharply in three days, causing social unrest. The people, who had been relieved for a month, felt a great weight on their hearts again.

On April 15th, the rice price rose from 28,000 yuan to 32,000 yuan per stone in one day, an increase of 4,000 yuan. On the 16th, it rose another 4,000 to 5,000 yuan, and on the 17th, it was even worse, jumping over 40,000 yuan. The situation worsened on the 18th and 19th, reaching 48,000 yuan. In just three or four days, the price almost doubled. The poor are crying, society is agitated, and newspapers are shouting.

City Council Willing to Curb Rising Prices

At the height of the price surge, the Changsha City Council took the lead in petitioning the provincial government, demanding measures to curb the rising prices. They also suggested investigating the amount of grain stored in the city's warehouses and requested price stabilization measures. The first measure was adopted by the city government, which immediately joined relevant parties and representatives of the rice industry to conduct a household-by-household investigation. The investigation revealed that the grain stored in Changsha's warehouses was only about 50,000 stones, enough to supply the city's people for only three or four days. This proved that the reserves were indeed small, and the supply was limited by transportation, preventing smooth distribution. The second measure was to have the People's Grain Company organize price stabilization sales. Of course, doing something is always better than doing nothing. However, preparations took time, and it only started after half a month. Each person could buy five liters of rice per day at 90% of the market price, or 360 yuan per liter.

After the city councilors' petition, news released by the Central News Agency stated that the soaring grain prices in Changsha were due to "certain powerful figures" purchasing large quantities of grain in the city and transporting it south, thus stimulating grain prices. The Central Daily News also had similar reports, and the Dagong Daily's editorial on the 17th, titled "Bureaucratic Capital Manipulating Rice Prices," also stated that recently "the residence of a certain magnate" had frequent dealings with local grain merchants, purchasing 50,000 stones of grain for transport south. Thus, the "certain powerful figures" and "the residence of a certain magnate" caused social unrest, and it seemed that someone was about to be revealed. Common people were astonished by the "certain powerful figures" and "the brother of a certain magnate."

Provincial Government Orders Secret Investigation of Grain Purchases

Provincial Chairman Wu Qiwu held a press conference on the 20th specifically to discuss the grain issue. All department heads attended except Yang Ruiling, the head of the Finance Department and concurrently head of the Provincial Food and Grain Department. Yang Ruiling sent Tao Chongzhou, the deputy head of the Food and Grain Department, as his representative. Chairman Wu reported on the provincial government's measures to address the grain price problem, first mentioning the purchase of military grain and then the methods for relieving the grain shortage. The conclusion was still to rush the transportation of grain from Sichuan.

Tao Chongzhou, the deputy head of the Food and Grain Department, became the target of numerous questions at the press conference. Tao seemed unable to cope. Tao said that the recent surge in grain prices was unexpected, and predicted that there would likely be further increases. Someone asked him that since he did not know about the price increase beforehand, it was understandable, but now that he knew it would rise in the future, did the Food and Grain Department have appropriate measures? Tao replied with the phrase "matters of confidentiality" to avoid answering.

Regarding the so-called "powerful figures" issue, the former chairman had mentioned that the newspapers were making insinuations and hoped that facts could be presented for severe punishment. An order was issued that day to all relevant agencies to secretly investigate the price situation of the so-called "powerful figures" purchasing grain, with a deadline of three days for reporting. However, after three days, there was still no information, and the rice price was still rising, reaching 50,000 yuan on the 23rd.

Changsha and the various counties could not bear such increases. The rapid spread of the price surge exceeded all records. It reached 70,000 yuan in Hengyang and 55,000 yuan in Changde, and Changde was a rice-producing area. Considering how high the prices were, the situation in other places could be imagined.

Objectively speaking, the Hunan grain shortage was mostly due to a lack of supply, but human factors were also significant. Taking the rural areas of Changsha and Xiangtan as examples: the price of grain in the countryside was 18 yuan in silver dollars per stone (each silver dollar worth 1,000 yuan in legal tender), and it was still difficult to buy, which was absolutely true. This proved that the production was indeed insufficient to meet consumption. As for human factors, there were many reasons.

County-Level Measures Not Implemented Thoroughly

The central government had stipulated that military grain should be purchased based on the average price on March 15th, and Hunan's set price was 12,000 yuan. The people originally had nothing to say, but the Food and Grain Department, which was responsible for purchasing military grain, deducted the money they had previously earned from purchasing military grain in the new price, so the actual amount issued was less than 12,000 yuan. Furthermore, after several transfers at the county level, the actual amount received by the people was even further from the stipulated amount. As a result, those who refused to sell were arrested, and many villagers were forced to commit suicide by drowning or hanging. The county level did not thoroughly implement the purchase measures, reflecting the failure of government orders. The original measures were to purchase grain along with the taxes, but later it was modified to target large households. Of course, only those with land were eligible, but at the county level, the substance changed. The county government changed the measures, regardless of poverty or wealth, imposing an equal levy. The poor, who had no means of survival, were also allocated quotas, even if it was only three or five liters. They were forced to sell their children to buy rice to pay, causing widespread resentment. As a result, living costs rose, and grain prices could not help but rise. This was one of the human factors.

Substituting Vegetables for Rice to Save it for Military Grain

Changde was originally a rice-producing area, but the recent situation was also very bad. The county was assigned to purchase 120,000 stones of military grain, leading to empty warehouses. Officials had no stored grain, and the people had no surplus grain. The Provincial Food and Grain Department even ordered the county government to transport 250,000 catties of rice to Zhijiang and another 600,000 catties to supply the Fifth Army passing through. As a result, every household in the city and countryside was assigned grain, and grain was urged from door to door. Even street vendors were not spared. The commissioner and county magistrate went to the countryside to urge collection, and the whole county was in turmoil. The troops had to eat, so the people had to starve. In places like Shigongqiao and Deshanhefu, nine out of ten families were eating vegetables for meals, saving rice to supply the troops. Furthermore, due to the spring drought, there was no rain, making it impossible to transplant rice seedlings. Conflicts over water, suicides due to lack of rice, and other such incidents were rampant.

Political Relief is More Important than Material Relief

These were all human factors. Therefore, political relief in Hunan was even more important than material relief. Mr. Yao Xuehuai, the deputy director of the Hunan Relief Sub-Office, accompanied Mr. Hoffman, the head of the Joint Relief's Hunan office, and a reporter from Life magazine on an inspection tour of various counties. Upon returning to Changsha, he told reporters that some people were using special powers to collude in various ways, forcibly buying grain, and manipulating profits, thus stimulating grain prices. Poor political governance at the grassroots level greatly hindered relief efforts. Many Baojia heads, regardless of whether the people were suffering from disaster, improperly levied donations and relentlessly oppressed them. Therefore, Mr. Yao emphasized the importance of political relief, believing that if political solutions were not found, even abundant material resources would be of no avail.

Fair levies and fair distribution were urgently needed in the current situation in Hunan. Nothing should be done deceptively anymore. Only by working practically and earnestly can there be a solution. The Joint Relief provided Hunan with 50 million yuan in grain loans. The provincial government organized a Hunan Provincial People's Food Adjustment Committee to manage it, but the Joint Treasury deducted 200 million yuan that had previously been lent to Changsha and Hengyang counties, so there were only 300 million yuan in reality. We do not understand the reasoning behind this, and it seems that the calculations were too precise.

The Hunan Provincial People's Food Adjustment Committee has been established for nearly two months, and although it has 300 million yuan in funds to use, the Changsha branch of the Joint Treasury is still requesting instructions on the loan method, so it has not yet received the loan. The actual amount used is still the remaining 200 million yuan from the 1945 Civil Servants' Living Subsidy, so it has not had a major effect.

### Cultural Barriers in Hong Kong

— Special Dispatch from Our Hong Kong Correspondent, Lin Youlan

Hong Kong's cultural circles, including people from all walks of life, and the special environment in which they are located, make their expressions quite complex and worth discussing. Recently, at a dinner hosted by Li Dachao, head of the Hong Kong and Macau branch of the Kuomintang, a representative of the Chinese-language Wah Tze Yat Po discovered that the host of the Overseas Chinese Daily, who had collaborated with the enemy during the occupation of Hong Kong, was also invited. He immediately walked out to protest. This is the latest storm in Hong Kong's cultural circles, and there is a story behind this storm:

The Overseas Chinese Daily Transforms Itself

The Overseas Chinese Daily is the only Hong Kong newspaper that, after Japan's surrender, transformed itself from praising the Japanese invaders and puppet government to flattering the Allied forces and caring for the motherland. In fact, the Overseas Chinese Daily is not the only newspaper that was published during the occupation of Hong Kong and still exists today. The most prominent is the Sing Tao Daily (formerly the Heung To Daily during the occupation), but its publisher returned to the motherland some years ago and rushed to Hong Kong after the war. People generally appreciate his intention to reform and are unwilling to dwell on his past.

Distinguishing Loyalty from Treachery

After the publication of the Kuomintang Daily by the Central Propaganda Department, Hong Kong finally had a newspaper that clearly distinguished right from wrong. This spring, the Hong Kong Commercial Daily republished with the slogan "Endure four years of sacrifice, maintain twenty years of glory." The righteous banner suddenly gained momentum. The distinction between loyalty and treachery was clear. The Overseas Chinese Daily, in contrast, felt a chill.

Seizing Weaknesses and Acting Recklessly

In order to reverse its decline, the Overseas Chinese Daily supported the resumption of publication of the Chung Wan Yat Po (originally called the Tung Ah Evening Post during the occupation), treating it as an ally and echoing each other. At the same time, it launched the Hong Kong Mail, creating a new front and planning for a possible retreat. It also sought to win over various parties, cultivate goodwill, and flatter the British while feigning obedience to the motherland and showing concern. Under the special circumstances of Hong Kong, our authorities in Hong Kong respect the laws of friendly nations and cannot exert full force. The Overseas Chinese Daily seized on this point, acting recklessly and doing whatever it pleased, using the inscriptions of important party and state officials as a guise to deceive overseas Chinese.

Releasing Air and Reorganizing

The Wah Tze Yat Po began republishing this month and took it upon itself to work against traitors. Shortly after its publication, it wrote an article advocating the punishment of Cen, the host of the Overseas Chinese Daily, and submitted it to the Guangdong provincial party, government, military, and relevant departments, requesting strict handling. Seeing that the situation was not good, the Overseas Chinese Daily recently rehired Zhang, the editor-in-chief from before the war, and released news of reorganizing internally. It was during this period that Director Li suddenly hosted a tea party for the press, and the Overseas Chinese Daily was among those invited, which led to the protest by the Wah Tze Yat Po. How our authorities will deal with the Overseas Chinese Daily, which collaborated with the enemy, is currently being watched by the cultural circles here.

Two Camps Do Not Interact

Recently, a reporter who came to Hong Kong from the mainland attended a Hong Kong cultural gathering and was surprised to find that there were very few people present. He could not help but ask, "Why are there so few cultural figures in Hong Kong?" This reporter did not know the inside story of Hong Kong's cultural circles. The "distinction between loyalty and treachery" mentioned above has divided the cultural circles into two distinct camps, glaring at each other and not interacting.

The Left-Wing Strides Forward

There are also some left-wing figures who claim to be progressive and stride forward, as if everyone is their enemy except for comrades who recognize the Soviet Union as their own country. This attitude naturally makes it impossible to work together harmoniously. Therefore, more than half a year has passed since the British army retook Hong Kong, and Hong Kong's cultural circles have not yet had any concrete work performance. Even a journalists' association cannot be formed.

Strengthening Unity and Opposing Indifference

In the future, how can Hong Kong's cultural circles unite to fulfill their duties to the country?

Most Hong Kong overseas Chinese are focused on doing business, and some even consider it noble not to talk about politics. Therefore, they often ignore the government's words and echo those who oppose the government, without distinguishing right from wrong.

Yellow Tabloids Relapse

In addition to left-wing newspapers that specialize in scolding and provoking, there are also yellow tabloids that specialize in discussing romance and teaching obscenity and theft. Currently, those tabloids are the only ones that can truly be economically self-sufficient in Hong Kong. Last month, the Hong Kong authorities summoned seven yellow newspapers for their "offensive morality" and gave them serious warnings, but their managers relapsed as soon as they left the government office, and the erotic content in their newspapers has not changed even a little. Many overseas Chinese also indulge in those romantic journals. Hong Kong's cultural circles are now filled with various toxins. How to eliminate those toxins is certainly worthy of everyone's consideration.

Educational Institutions in Stagnation

After three years and eight months of Japanese rule in Hong Kong, social atmosphere is going downhill, and educational institutions are completely at a standstill. Adults are shameless and pursue fame and profit. Children are out of school, using communication with foreigners instead of textbooks. Since the recovery, everything is waiting to be revived, and the restoration of cultural organizations and overseas Chinese schools has not reached a perfect state. Everyone is looking forward to a vigorous Hong Kong cultural movement.

### Viewing Japanese Prisoners Repairing Roads: 40-Kilometer Project Completed

— Nanjing Dispatch, May 6, Wei Wang

After Japan surrendered, tens of thousands of disarmed soldiers remained in Nanjing. They had brutally murdered Chinese people and destroyed the capital's construction. Letting them repair these destroyed buildings is not a harsh treatment, but a fair punishment. The Municipal Public Works Bureau planned to build roads outside and inside the city starting in November of last year. In terms of manpower, unarmed Japanese prisoners of war were used, and the municipal government provided financial resources, the Army Headquarters was responsible for materials, and the Public Works Bureau used its manpower, financial resources, and material strength to begin building roads around the city. That is, from Zhongyangmen to Yanziji, Yanziji to Yaohuamen, Yaohuamen to Taipingmen, and Yanziji to Baota Bridge in Xiaguan. Inside the city, the roads from the Army Headquarters to the Guanghuamen outside the airfield, as well as the US military parking lot attached to the Ming Palace airfield repair shop on Zhongshan Road, Hanzhong Road, and Mochou Road in the city center, totaling 40 kilometers, have all been completed. The Municipal Public Works Bureau specially invited the press to depart from the municipal government and go out of Taipingmen to view the completed road construction achievements.

Planting Small Grass to Prevent Collapse

The weather was gloomy, with a misty drizzle. The car proceeded in Dayeli. The speed of the car moved forward with a brisk tune in the gentle spring breeze.

The endless wheat fields, lined with clear streams and blue-gray cliffs, had more than a hundred Japanese prisoners working on them, wearing light yellow invading coats, carrying tools, and opening up a flat road for the victims. The car body was stable all the way, and the road surface paved with yellow sand and mud was only slightly inferior to asphalt in smoothness. Everyone was quite satisfied. When arriving at Yanziji, Dai Genfa, the director of the Japanese prisoner of war work office, explained that all the roads built by the Japanese prisoners were quite well-made, and the Japanese prisoners worked very hard. In order to prevent the collapse of the roadbed, small grasses were planted on the roadside. They obeyed the orders of our superiors.

Mayor Personally Supervises Road Repairs

After the visit to Yanziji was completed, we set off to visit the section in Xiaguan. The Twelve Caves along the mountain were scenic spots and scenic areas, and this road was even flatter. The north side of the road was the Yangtze River, the south side was high mountains and heavy rocks, and the road was close to the green pomegranate trees and cherry orchards. The wild fragrance was pungent, and there was no dust on the avenue. It should be a pleasure to enjoy the spring here.

After returning from Baota Bridge to Yanziji, Mayor Ma was met along the way and moved forward together. Mayor Ma pointed out where the roadbed should be modified and the drainage of the sewers.

Proceeding from Yanziji to Yaohuamen, a section of the road surface was paved with gravel. As far as the Xu Da Tomb in the area near Yaohuamen Station, this section of the road surface was very good, and the car speed reached 30 miles. The weather turned warmer, and the sunlight shone on the body, slightly warm. This section of the road was very long, and the road surface was five meters wide. All roads were filled with four-inch diameter stones, covered with crushed stone, and then added with sand and mud. It will never collapse due to rain. At twelve o'clock, we entered Taipingmen and went straight to Lizhi Society for a meal.

Huge Project, Considerable Achievements

At half past twelve, we departed from Lizhi Society and went straight to the airfield outside Guanghuamen. The road surface was paved with cement, which was particularly flat and comfortable. When we circled back, we went to the Ming Palace Airport Repair Shop to visit the construction of the US military parking lot. Hundreds of Japanese prisoners were stepping up their construction.

Director Dai explained in detail the efficiency of the work and the firmness after completion, and then took the car straight to the Public Works Office of Zhongshan Road for rest. By the time we arrived at the Public Works Office, only six reporters were left. Later, because of running around all day, I felt quite tired, and it was proposed to visit Hanzhong Road, Mochou Road, and the Qinhuai River section, but all were abandoned. Director Dai said of this huge project: the cost was 110 million, mobilizing 12,000 Japanese prisoners. In a few months, there have been many praises from all parties for this achievement, which can be gratifying. The construction of roads and sewers in the Army Headquarters is also underway and will be completed soon. (Contemporary Society)

Mother's Day Special Issue

### The Great Mother

— Jiayin

The Shanghai Children's Village, under the planning of social leaders and enthusiastic people, is gradually taking shape and is expected to be established soon.

The goal of the Children's Village is to help orphans without parents and young people who cannot adapt to society, so that they can grow up, have a skill, and become useful members of society. In other words, if the Children's Village is realized, it will become the mother of Shanghai's unfortunate children and young people, that is, the great mother of society.

On this first Mother's Day after the victory, in addition to redoubling our thoughts and gratitude for our own mothers and the hard work of all the good mothers in the world in raising their children, promoting the realization of the Shanghai Children's Village - the great mother of society - is indeed an extremely important and meaningful task.

The fundraising campaign for the Children's Village is about to begin. We hope that everyone will enthusiastically sponsor and participate in this meaningful campaign. Using helping this work to commemorate our mothers is the most appropriate thing to do.

### Reflections Inspired by Mother's Day

— Mu Lei

Ellen Key said: "The greatest thing in the world is a mother. Motherly love shines upon the earth like warm sunshine." Indeed, motherly love is worthy of praise. If mothers did not share their love with their children, the very continuation of new cells within the nation's body might have long ceased.

If we believe that the twentieth century is the century of children, then we must acknowledge that mothers in the twentieth century bear extremely heavy responsibilities. Mothers must bear at least a large portion of the responsibility for the education of children. The growth and development of young seedlings and tender shoots rely entirely on a mother's nurturing.

I am not saying that fathers can ignore the education of children and unload all the responsibility onto the children's mother, but mothers have the most contact with their children, and the influence they exert on their children is also greater. Throughout history, both in China and abroad, there are numerous famous people who have succeeded under the influence and guidance of a good mother's education.

In our country, the attitude of parents in educating their children can be summarized in the four characters "strict father, loving mother." Fathers are often strict, while mothers are often kind. Some say that under a strict-and-lenient education, children can achieve appropriate development in terms of knowledge, ability, and character. We often see in some families that when children break the rules or engage in bad behavior, the father always deals with them extremely severely. Scolding and reprimanding are not enough, and physical punishment is added. When the children reach the point of being unable to bear it, the mother comforts and forgives them in every possible way. The mother believes that her child has been punished and must be comforted. At this time, the child even uses blackmail to make many unreasonable demands, which the mother invariably refuses to reject. The child, who had just been beaten and scolded by the father until they cried, immediately smiles again under the mother's loving caress. This method of education, alternating between strictness and leniency, is commonly applied in general families.

Inconsistent attitudes of parents in educating their children can not only affect the healthy development of the child's psychology, but also cause various drawbacks and reduce the effectiveness of education. From the perspective of mental hygiene, parents should always maintain an appropriate and consistent attitude towards their children. Being too strict or too lenient is not good. Children have great plasticity and sensitivity. Negative suggestions can destroy their fragile minds and harm their mental health. A normal emotional life can only be cultivated in a normal environment. We do not believe that "strict father, loving mother" is an immutable principle. Strictness is necessary, but it should not be limited to the father's strictness; the mother also needs to be strict. Kindness is also necessary, but it should not be limited to the mother's kindness; the father also needs to be kind. Strictness and kindness are not two extremes; both parents must achieve "strict but kind" and "kind but strict." Strictness does not necessarily mean being completely severe and cold; strictness should be interpreted as being upright, fair, selfless, and authoritative. In educating children, parents should focus on setting an example and using authority and emotion to influence and guide them. Unrestrained indulgence is naturally also inappropriate; rewards and punishments must be balanced, and strictness and leniency must be applied appropriately. Parents should not teach their children to be afraid at first sight and avoid them; they should teach their children to have respect and trust upon seeing them. In the past, most parents in our country seemed to have neglected these points. Fathers often represented Yama, the king of hell, and children did not dare to get close to them, while mothers, because they were too lenient and prone to spoiling, became honey in the eyes of the children, but they did not necessarily respect them or listen to their advice. This has a very bad influence on the education of children.

Today is Mother's Day, and I would like to take this opportunity to advise all mothers to use your appropriate love to nurture the growth of your children, not to forgive them blindly, but to correct your children's bad habits and behaviors with a clear and fair attitude, and promote the development of their healthy bodies and minds. Do not cover up your children's shortcomings, and do not stand at the other extreme from the children's father by excessively pleasing your children. Remember to educate your children with the same attitude as the children's father.

### The Mother of Mother's Day – Anna Jarvis

— Zi Fang

Anna Jarvis is now fifteen years old. She is very thin and blind. When Mother's Day comes, her room is filled with flowers. Doctors and nurses from the sanatorium come to see her. The Jarvis Committee sends people to read the many congratulatory letters she receives.

When Jarvis initiated the filial piety movement, she was still a beautiful and lively young woman. Unfortunately, she had a blind sister, Wen Xi Nuo. In order to take care of her poor sister, she rejected several men who proposed to her, sacrificing the happiness of her married life. Her mother was the daughter of a pastor from Grafton, West Virginia, who loved flowers, especially red chrysanthemums.

About fifty years ago, Anna's family moved to Philadelphia to live with Anna's brother, Kraut. A few years later, Kraut died, leaving behind about 700,000 yuan in property, which was to be shared by Anna and her sister. Unexpectedly, some of Kraut's creditors came to divide it up, and by last year, all the inheritance had vanished.

In May 1905, Anna's mother died. Having lost her brother and then her mother, she only had her blind sister to rely on. This caused her immense grief. On the second anniversary of her mother's death, she announced during a service at Grafton Church that she was preparing to launch a movement for the "forgotten" mothers of the world.

She said: "Mothers suffer more and enjoy less. When they are alive, their children are often ignorant, and by the time they want to be filial, they are gone."

So she wrote letters in Philadelphia to heads of state, governors, teachers, pastors, etc., urging:

"Every day is of course a day to honor our mothers, but in order to express sublime and persevering love, we should designate a special day."

Her letters immediately took effect, and celebrities such as Joseph Daniel, former President Theodore Roosevelt, and oil tycoon Rockefeller all responded with letters.

In 190W, the Presbyterian Church held a meeting in Seattle and stipulated that pastors in the church should bless mothers on the second Sunday of every May. Believers whose mothers were alive wrote letters to the elders to show their love and respect; those whose mothers had passed away wore white chrysanthemums to express their grief.

On May 7, 1914, the United States Senate unanimously passed Thomas Sifferlin's proposal to designate the second Sunday of May as Mother's Day. On May 9, President Wilson announced that Mother's Day was "a public expression of our filial piety to our mothers."

Forty-three countries have accepted the suggestion of Mother's Day. Anna was surprised and delighted to see that the movement she had initiated had achieved such great success. This movement has spread to every corner of the world, but inevitably some things have changed in nature.

"Mother's Day," she sighed to a reporter who interviewed her, "has been ruined by ignorant and greedy people. Telegraph offices have created ready-made clichés, and florists, candy stores, greeting card merchants, and even the barber next door are using my idea to attract customers and make money. A printed greeting card is meaningless; on the contrary, it shows your laziness, that you are too lazy to write a letter to your mother yourself, and your mother is better to you than anyone else in the world. Candy! You brought a box home for your mother to eat, but after a while, you ate it yourself. No matter what you do, give her what she lacks and needs! That was the original intention of my initiative for Mother's Day."

She hated all the advertising and profiteering that used Mother's Day as a business opportunity. She was once taken to the officer corps for disrupting order for opposing the sale of flowers in the meeting place. In 1934, she went to Washington to condemn James Wallace for issuing Mother's Day commemorative stamps.

Anna is truly lonely and isolated, almost cut off from the world. However, she has quite a few trustees. She arranged for a clipping service to specifically cut and send news about her from newspapers and magazines. In this way, her files became so numerous that she had to buy the house next door to store them.

On a bitterly cold day in November 1942, Anna staggered into a Philadelphia hospital for treatment, emaciated, blind, impoverished, and ending her days in desolation.

Poor Anna only received good care in her declining years. She no longer quarreled with florists and candy merchants, and they were also donating to the Anna Jarvis Foundation. After her death, the people will ask the government to jointly build a permanent building to commemorate this person who sacrificed her intelligence, spirit, and happiness for Mother's Day.

### Mother's Day Reflections

— Jin Chun

Today is another annual Mother's Day.

Those who know it's Mother's Day and have the opportunity or need to participate in the celebration, as usual, celebrate: speeches, parades, posting slogans, those with mothers wear red flowers, those without mothers wear white flowers.

When I see a group of people celebrating Mother's Day, I think of a group of people celebrating their own mothers' birthdays or their mothers' birthdays.

Ordinary families always prepare food and wine, and wealthy families invite more guests, or issue a slight essay, advocating and harmonizing a few poems for their mothers' birthdays. No matter what the situation of the mother is normally, she is celebrated happily by everyone at least on this day.

When I see people celebrating their mothers' birthdays, I remember a saying of Confucius.

Confucius once said: "The age of one's parents must be known: on the one hand, it brings joy; on the other hand, it brings fear."

I dare not speculate whether Confucius' words were spoken for a group of people celebrating their parents' birthdays, but every time I see people celebrating their mothers' birthdays, I think of these words.

In the congratulatory messages for mothers' birthdays, have we ever seen anything more full of deep affection, have we ever seen anything more revealing of filial piety?

How many people, on their mother's birthday, will think of their mother's age and increase their filial piety? Similarly, how many people are willing to take a look at the situation of the modern mothers of our country on Mother's Day and think a little about the true meaning of Mother's Day?

On Mother's Day, please take a quiet look at your mother's kind face, look at the layers of wrinkles on her forehead, recording her hard work and bitter experiences; the silver-like white hair on the top of her head, filled with desolate and vicissitudes of memories: the grievances of the daughters-in-law who are not harmonious, the disputes between the sisters-in-law, the conflicts between wives and concubines, and the contradictions with the thoughts of the children, some have gradually become past historical relics, and some are still being repeated in our generation, adding many new troubles and hardships.

When celebrating a mother's birthday, one should think of her age and increase one's filial piety; on this day of celebrating Mother's Day, should we not look around at the circumstances of the mothers of our country and redouble our efforts and vigilance?

How should we work hard to improve the situation of the mothers in general, so that we can be worthy of our own mothers? How should we improve the situation of the mothers in general, so that we can better fulfill our responsibilities to our children?

We must be filial to our mothers, and mothers must fulfill their responsibilities.

Every year when celebrating Mother's Day, how much comfort has been gained on the filial piety side? How much achievement has been gained on the responsibility side?

Celebrating Mother's Day is a happy thing, but it is best to add some vigilance. Celebrating Mother's Day with the feeling of "on the one hand, it brings joy; on the other hand, it brings fear" may make Mother's Day more meaningful.
