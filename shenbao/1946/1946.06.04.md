[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, returned to the capital at 6:00 PM on the 3rd. The Chairman left Beijing on May 24th and, in the past ten days, inspected Beiping, Shenyang, Changchun, and Jinan.

[Our Beiping Office, 3rd] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife and entourage, departed at 10:40 AM on the 3rd to return to the capital by air. The Chairman arrived in Beiping on the 30th of last month and stayed for ninety hours.

[Our Beiping Office, 3rd] During his ninety hours in Beiping, Chairman Chiang inquired about various departments and aspects. Previously, Madame Chiang visited the most prosperous Dong'an Market in Beiping to subtly inquire about business conditions and the people's livelihood. Yesterday evening, after 7:00 PM, the Chairman, accompanied by his wife, traveled lightly to the San Beizi Garden in the western suburbs. Mayor Xiong invited famous Beiping opera singers to perform, and the Chairman specifically requested an additional performance of the play "Hua Rong Dao," in which Guan Yunchang magnanimously releases Cao Cao. During the Chairman's stay in Beiping, all aspects appeared orderly and active, and prices also showed a decline. However, citizens are worried about whether prices will rise again after the Chairman leaves, as they did last time.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 3rd] Chairman Chiang received all members of the Hebei Provincial Government and Chairman Feng Qin-zai of Chahar Province at his official residence at 9:00 AM on the 3rd.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 3rd] Chairman Chiang and his wife arrived in Jinan on the 3rd while returning to the capital from Beiping. Due to time constraints, they stayed in Jinan for less than four hours and were unable to enter the city to receive the welcome of 800,000 citizens. The Chairman and his wife arrived in Jinan at 12:40 PM on the 3rd aboard a C-54 large aircraft. Chief of Staff of the Jinan Garrison and Deputy Director Wang Shuming arrived earlier in two separate planes with the security personnel. Party, government, and military leaders, including Wang Yaowu and He Siyuan, greeted them at the airport, and the Air Force Headquarters near the airport was used as the temporary headquarters. After disembarking, the Chairman and his wife went to the temporary headquarters to rest, then had lunch accompanied by the heads of various agencies. After lunch, they summoned senior and mid-level officers from various units for a briefing. Subsequently, they met separately with He Siyuan, Pang Jingtang, Pei Mingzong, Zang Yuanjun, and officers above the rank of division commander from various units.

Madame Chiang received them on behalf of the Chairman. At 4:10 PM, the Chairman and his wife left the temporary headquarters for the airport. Before boarding, the Chairman took group photos with various senior generals as a memento. At 4:25 PM, they boarded the plane and left Jinan to return to the capital. It had long been rumored that the Chairman and his wife would be coming to Jinan. On the morning of the 3rd, the entire city hung flags, and citizens spontaneously lined the streets to welcome them all day long, dispersing only after the Chairman and his wife left Jinan.

### Capital Commemorates Anti-Smoking Day: Chairman Issues Instructions Encouraging the Eradication of the Great Enemy

[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] The Anti-Smoking Day Commemorative Assembly was held this morning, presided over by Mayor Ma. The new Chief of Police, the Director of the Health Bureau, and over two thousand citizens attended. After speeches by the Chairman and other officials, a Jingyun Dagu performance entitled "Eradicating Opium and New Life" was presented. Afterwards, the confiscated opium and related paraphernalia were burned in the square. From September of last year to March of this year, a total of 64.2 taels of opium and 249 pieces of paraphernalia were seized. In addition, opium and related items handed over by the former puppet capital's District Court Prosecutor's Office were burned. The fierce flames soared into the sky, and onlookers shouted slogans. The fire was not extinguished by the afternoon.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] On the 3rd, Chairman Chiang issued the following instructions to the Anti-Smoking Day Commemorative Assembly in the capital: "Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Interior, Director Wang of the Anti-Smoking Committee, and all those attending the Anti-Smoking Day Assembly, this year's Anti-Smoking Day Commemorative Assembly is being held after the victory of the War of Resistance and the government's return to the capital. Its significance is profound and surpasses the ordinary. Our purpose in resisting aggression and building the nation is to seek the independence and self-reliance of the country and the nation. Now that the task of resisting aggression is difficult to call complete, and the task of nation-building has only just begun, our nation will soon strive to forge ahead to shoulder an even more arduous task. Strengthening the physical constitution of the people and enhancing the health of the nation are the most urgent requirements at this time. Looking back, the scourge of opium has plagued our country for a century and has long been a great enemy to the survival and development of our nation. The government's six-year anti-smoking policy before the war was unfortunately thwarted by the enemy's invasion. Especially in the occupied areas, the enemy's poisoning conspiracy against our compatriots was extremely sinister and ruthless, employing every possible means. Although the government was determined to ban opium, its authority was insufficient to do anything about it. Now, fortunately, the lost territory has been recovered, and all conditions are in place to carry out the unfinished work before the war and sweep away the poison left by the enemy. This is the government's inescapable responsibility. All our compatriots must also be keenly aware of the difficulty of obtaining freedom, strive for the vitality of a new life, and abstain from harmful contamination in order to achieve the reality of a strong nation and a strong people. If opium cannot be eradicated in a single day, it will be no different from the enemy occupying our land for a single day. Not only will the nation's life continue to be eroded, but the task of nation-building will not be able to begin, and there will be no way to face the spirits of the Founding Father and the virtuous martyrs in heaven, or the expectations of friendly nations towards us. Therefore, the government will concentrate all its efforts to completely eradicate this great enemy in the shortest possible time. All areas under government authority must complete the ban within six months after the government's authority is fully established, and no more opium must be found. In remote areas, where the people often privately cultivate opium poppies to make illegal profits, strict attention must be paid to investigation and eradication, without the slightest negligence. In short, the government regards opium, whether it is cultivated, transported, sold, or smoked, as a public enemy of our people and will impose severe penalties without the slightest leniency. Government officials at all levels should be aware of the importance of their anti-smoking responsibilities, which are not only related to the success of their political achievements but also to their inherent duties. If they fail to enforce the ban and allow opium to flourish, they will not only be unable to escape the sanctions of the law but will also be condemned by conscience and the world. It is hoped that those who understand the greater good will repeatedly advise their relatives and friends to strictly abide by the ban and not violate it in any way. Together, we must uphold the spirit of eliminating the poison and strive to achieve the practical effect of removing old habits, so that the atmosphere of the nation will be transformed, and international opinion will be renewed. This is our great hope. Chiang Chung-cheng."

### Chen Cheng Attends Central Memorial Week: Reports on the Advantages of the New Military System and Explains the Situation in the Northeast in Detail

[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] The Central Memorial Week was held at the National Government at 9:00 AM on the 3rd. Over 350 officials from various Yuan, Ministries, and Commissions attended. Deputy Director Zhou Zhong of the Examination Yuan presided over the ceremony. After leading the attendees in paying their respects, the newly appointed Chief of General Staff of the Ministry of National Defense, Chen Cheng, delivered a report. He first stated that the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense was an epoch-making reform in the history of China's military building and that this new military system was extremely suitable for China's current environment. He then analyzed the current military and political steps being implemented in China: (1) The implementation of the military reorganization plan should be carried out step by step according to the government's established policy. (2) The establishment of the new Ministry of National Defense will establish a new military system with the following advantages: (A) The military will be controlled by the government, achieving the goal of returning the military to the nation. (B) The command of the army, navy, and air force will be unified, achieving military unity. Certain characteristics can be listed: First, the government has power, and the military has ability. By using power to control ability, the military can fully exert its capabilities. Second, the three-linked system of government administration is coordinated. At this point in his report, Chen also reported on the handling of enemy and puppet military supplies that had been received. Finally, he gave a detailed explanation of the war situation in the Northeast.

### UNRRA Far East Regional Committee to Open in the Capital on the 7th; China's Relief Issues Will Be the Focus of Discussion; Representatives and Advisors from Various Countries Have Arrived in the Capital

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] As the UNRRA Far East Regional Committee is about to convene, Director-General of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), Chiang Yen-shih, is scheduled to arrive in the capital by train from Shanghai on the evening of the 3rd to provide instructions on various preparatory matters before the meeting.

### Ceasefire, Restoration of Roads, and Implementation of Military Reorganization are Urgent Needs for the Entire Country; Zhou Enlai Visited Marshall Yesterday for a Long Talk

[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] There is much speculation about the political trends after Chairman Chiang's return to the capital. However, according to a well-informed source here, the government's established policy will not change due to the new situation in the Northeast. The concern is that after the Communist Party's setbacks in the Northeast, it has obviously rehashed its old tune of "full ceasefire" and "sincere consultation," while secretly taking advantage of this gap to carry out new military deployments. Even in the Northeast, two months later, the green crops will provide favorable conditions for the Communist troops to harass. Therefore, while the government's door to peace talks remains open, lessons learned from the past suggest that this kind of tolerance has a maximum limit. Even during this waiting period, the military will change from its past passive defense to an active defense. The experiences of Sipingjie and Changchun, which only caused suffering to the people and depleted the country's strength, have forced the government to take this step.

[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] Today, the newly appointed Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, in his report on the military situation in the Northeast at the Central Memorial Week, after analyzing the battle situation in Sipingjie, expressed his personal views on national affairs with a resolute tone, saying that he would never oppose a peaceful solution to the Northeast problem, nor would he oppose any party's request for a ceasefire, nor would he oppose resolving the current disputes through political consultations. However, the above-mentioned methods must have a definite time limit, because the people really cannot afford to wait. A real ceasefire and the restoration of transportation are urgent needs for the entire country. The full implementation of the military reorganization plan should also be carried out simultaneously.

[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] Zhou Enlai visited Marshal Marshall at 10:00 AM on the 3rd and talked with him at length until 1:00 PM in the afternoon. Song Ziwen and Zhang Qun also held separate talks with Li Huang and Liu Dongyan of the Youth Party and representatives of the Democratic League. Lei Zhen returned to the capital on the morning of the 3rd. According to him, Chen Qitian, Hui Qi, and Chang Naiying of the Youth Party are scheduled to come to the capital this Thursday to attend the resident committee meeting of the National Political Council.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Representatives of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) Democratic League Luo Longji, Huang Yanpei, Liang Shuming, Zhang Bojun, and representatives of social figures Mo Dehui, visited Li Huang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Youth Party, on the 3rd in the morning and afternoon to exchange views on the current domestic situation. It is also learned that Chen Qitian, a representative of the Youth Party, is scheduled to come to the capital on the 6th.

### Yang Chuo'an Arrives in Beiping: Will Transfer to Shenyang in Two or Three Days

[Our Beiping Office, 3rd] As the Nationalist troops in the Northeast are advancing rapidly towards Harbin, Mayor of Harbin Yang Chuo'an has been conducting his circuitous travels along the complex lines of diplomacy and internal affairs for the past month. On April 25th, Yang and others bid farewell to Harbin under the pressure of the Communist troops and withdrew into Soviet territory in Vladivostok with the Soviet army. At the end of last month, he returned to the country by boat and arrived in Shanghai. Today, he flew from Shanghai to Beiping and will transfer to Shenyang in two or three days. If the Nationalist troops recently stationed in Harbin, then Yang will return to Harbin, which he bid farewell to months ago, as geometrically depicted. This reporter visited Yang at the old site of the Zhengjin Bank at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd. According to him, the withdrawal of central personnel from Harbin was extremely orderly. Before leaving, the city government handed over political power to the city council (the chairman of the council is He Zhian, and there are two vice-chairmen). Each central receiving agency clearly explained and entrusted responsible persons before leaving. The agencies, schools, and hospitals all issued one month's salary in advance because even if government personnel withdrew, children could not be deprived of their education, and people could not be deprived of medical care. At that time, the Communist troops had already entered the city, but because they tried to avoid anything that could cause bloodshed, he dealt with them frankly, and no unfortunate incidents occurred. On April 25th, the 80 people of the Harbin Songnen receiving personnel and the military delegation openly took more than ten cars to the station at 2:00 PM that afternoon and took a train with the Soviet army to withdraw, arriving in Vladivostok after a two-day journey. The military delegation led by Dong Yanping returned to Kuan Chengzi and transferred to a train to Khabarovsk to continue working at the Soviet military headquarters. They stayed at a sanatorium by the sea in Vladivostok for more than 20 days, waiting for a ship. Yang said: The Soviet Union treated them very well on the way to the Soviet Union and in Vladivostok.

### Over a Thousand Wounded and Sick Soldiers of the Communist Army in Eastern Hubei Transported to Handan

### Chairman's Broadcast Instructions to the Youth Army

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The National Youth Expeditionary Force (except for soldiers of the 207th Division who voluntarily extended their service) began to be demobilized in June. Chairman Chiang specifically broadcast instructions to the soldiers of each division of the army at 9:00 PM on the 3rd. The full text is as follows:

All soldiers of our National Revolutionary Army Youth Expeditionary Force, you have been enlisted for over a year. During this year, our country has undergone arduous struggles and achieved the final victory of the War of Resistance. The term of service for our Youth Expeditionary Force soldiers is also coming to an end. At this time of demobilization, I want to especially tell all our officers and soldiers, you should earnestly reflect on your experience in training in this army over the past year. What have you learned? What is the relationship between this training and your future career prospects? What kind of contributions should you make to the country and the revolution in the future? Before you are demobilized, you must have a detailed study and understanding of these issues, so that you will not fail the aspirations of your enlistment and training this time.

Since you responded to the call of this Committee Chairman and joined the revolutionary ranks at the end of the previous year when the War of Resistance was at its most critical, during this year or more of your enlistment, you have certainly made great progress in military knowledge and skills, and the training you have received in your life and actions is particularly important. This is a most valuable kind of training that cannot be obtained in other ordinary schools and in society. As long as you can follow this training you have already received, continue to practice it unceasingly, consistently, and strive for self-improvement after demobilization, in any national system, you will certainly be able to succeed in your career and become a leader of the people, and you will not be unworthy of being a cadre for revolutionary nation-building.

Everyone must know that the failure of our Chinese general school education in recent years is due to the failure to pay attention to life training. General teachers and students regard the order of life and the discipline of action as unimportant, thinking that students only need to pass the subject scores. They think that the quality of young students' life actions and character is irrelevant. However, it is not known that it is precisely because of this reason that we have ruined the future careers of our young people and lost the endless life of our nation. Therefore, if we want to build the nation in the future, we must first establish the foundation for nation-building, especially the foundation of our national intellectual youth. Only when young people have a sound foundation can the nation have life. What is the foundation of youth? It is his orderly life, habits, and organized consistent actions. In other words, it is the public morality necessary for modern citizens, the social order and group discipline that everyone should observe. It must be so, so that every citizen can know how to respect social order and group discipline, and can automatically, autonomously, help each other, cooperate, be self-reliant, and strive for self-improvement, be selfless, and then can achieve our goal of establishing a modern nation with independence and equality. The value of military training lies in this, because in addition to military knowledge and technology, the most important thing in the army is the development of group life, and group life pays special attention to discipline and order. Everyone must know that the order of life and the discipline of action can be said to be the basic conditions for each of us to succeed in our careers. Not only should we pay attention to them in the army, but even after demobilization, wherever we go in society or schools, as well as in the agricultural, industrial, economic, township, baojia, and various levels, we must maintain this characteristic of life, value order, abide by discipline, be automatic, autonomous, self-reliant, and strive for self-improvement. Then we can serve as a model for the general public and exert the leading role of one as ten, and one as a hundred. (To be continued tomorrow)

### US Military Headquarters in China Not to be Withdrawn Temporarily at the End of June; Gillern Says Scope to be Reduced as Much as Possible

[Central News Agency Special Dispatch] Lieutenant General Gillern, Commander of the US Military Headquarters in China, told a Central News Agency reporter yesterday: (1) The US Military Headquarters in China will not be withdrawn at the end of June this year, but its scope will be reduced as much as possible and will change with the environment. In the near future, there will be no major changes in the US Military Headquarters. In the second half of 1946, the US Military Headquarters will have about 4,000 personnel. He also said: The US Department of the Army has begun preparing to transport the families of US military personnel who will be working in China to China. The first batch may arrive in September of this year. The number is not yet determined. They will bring all kinds of furniture and daily necessities with them because prices in Shanghai are too high, and the US military cannot afford them. The US military authorities are planning in detail the housing and children's education issues for the US military families after they arrive in China. (2) The reporter also asked about the progress of the repatriation of Japanese residents. General Gillern replied: All Japanese residents in North China have been evacuated. A very small number who are still in North China will also be sent back to their country in the coming days. As for the repatriation of Japanese residents in the Nine Northeastern Provinces, it has only recently begun. There are no statistics at the same time. In addition, the instability in the Northeast is an obstacle and an influence. Therefore, the number of Japanese residents in the Northeast who are being repatriated each month is an (uncertain) statistic. (3) General Gillern has previously denied the accusation of a certain newspaper that US aircraft are assisting the National Army. He reiterated the mission of the US military in China, saying that the US military has been ordered to absolutely prohibit participation in any side's war and to avoid involvement in the disputes between the Nationalists and the Communists in order to avoid fueling the war. Finally, General Gillern said that the US military's policy in China is based on the US government, and he himself has no right to express any opinions. As for whether the US policy will change if the war in China continues, he is unable to express any opinion.

### Battle for Harbin to Begin, Communist Forces Build Defenses Along Xing'an Mountains

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Reliable sources say that over 10,000 elite national vanguard troops who have crossed the Songhua River have reached the suburbs of Harbin, only forty li from the city. Communist forces there are relying on fortifications to resist stubbornly. It is also reported that Communist forces have built defensive works along the Xing'an Mountains and are constructing fortresses in Qiqihar for encirclement and defense. The battle for Harbin is about to begin. According to those arriving in Nanjing from the Northeast, judging by the morale of both sides and the popular sentiment in the Northeast, if the Communist forces remain stubborn, they will repeat the mistakes of Siping Street without a doubt.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 3rd] National troops are currently advancing on Harbin in seven columns. The city may fall at any moment. National troops are currently only three miles from the city. If the National troops move north from Harbin towards Qiqihar, they may encounter strong resistance from the Communist forces.

[United Press, Nanjing, 3rd] According to Chinese newspapers, National troops have reached Nanling (transliteration) in the suburbs of Harbin but are encountering fierce resistance from the Communist forces. There are currently 75,000 Soviet people in Harbin.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Zhou Enlai publicly stated that major battles have occurred in Yingkou, Anshan, and Fushun, and hinted that Communist forces would rely on the Xing'an Mountains to block the National troops' continued advance.

### Arch-Traitor Cannot Escape National Law, Chen Gongbo Executed by Firing Squad in Suzhou, Bids Farewell to Fellow Traitors Chen and Chu Before Execution

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 3rd] Chen Gongbo, the acting chairman of the puppet Nationalist government, was executed by firing squad in the Third Prison this morning. At 7:30 AM, Prosecutor Li Shudong of the Suzhou High Procuratorate, accompanied by Recorder Wang Xuefan, led seven bailiffs including Chief Police Officer of Suzhou to the Third Prison in Shizi Street by car at 8:00 AM. A temporary court was set up in an empty room in the prison. Warden Chen Songnian sent Chief Guard Hua Ruiting to cell number one in the Character block with four guards to deliver the final verdict of the Supreme Court to the traitor Chen Gongbo and ordered him to imprint his fingerprints on the original. Chen had just finished breakfast and was writing a couplet for the chief guard. He had just written the last two characters "bright moon" of the second line when he was taken to the temporary court. At this time, Chen did not know he was about to be executed. He was wearing a short, gray, black-striped woolen jacket and trousers, gray thread socks, and black woven single shoes. Seeing bailiffs standing everywhere in the court and the prosecutor sitting upright behind the desk, he realized that death was imminent. However, his attitude remained extremely calm. In a tone of complete indifference, he said, "I understand. It's today, isn't it? Let me go back and put on a long gown. It'll look better." So he turned and returned to his cell, placed the watch, money, pen and other small items from his pockets on the bed, changed into new black thread socks and half-new black half-high pointed leather shoes, and put on a blue-gray Shilin cloth long gown. He calmly shook hands with Chu Minyi, his neighbor in the next cell, and they said goodbye to each other. He also met Chen Bijun in the women's prison, shook her hand and told her of his impending death. Finally, he instructed that a glass mouthwash cup for daily use must be buried with him. After these instructions, he returned to the temporary court, held onto the edge of the desk with both hands, and leaned forward to listen quietly to the final interrogation. After Prosecutor Li asked about his age and origin, he asked if he had any last words to be conveyed to his family. Chen replied, "I don't know where my family is. I have no last words." Prosecutor Li pointed to a small table nearby and said that if he had any documents to leave behind, he could sit down and write them. Chen replied, "I have a petition to Chairman Chiang, which is one-third completed. But to finish it would take three hours. I would feel uneasy to make you all sit and wait for so long for my sake. Besides, it seems unnecessary now." Then he smiled and shook hands with Prosecutor Li and Recorder Wang, saying "Goodbye." When the bailiffs wanted to tie him up, Chen smiled and asked them to dispense with it, saying, "No need for that. Let me have some dignity." He pointed to Ju Hongfan of the police bureau, who was standing next to him with a gun, and said, "You are the executioner, aren't you? Please be quick about it and don't make my face look too ugly." After speaking, he strode towards the wasteland behind the prison, which was the execution ground. He stood upright in the center of the execution ground, facing north and with his back to the south. Prosecutor Li, Recorder Wang, and Warden Chen all came to the site to supervise. At 8:30 AM, the execution order was given. Chen closed his eyes and tilted his head slightly to the side. Executioner Zhou Hongfan stood more than two feet away from Chen and fired a shot, which hit the back of his head and exited through his right cheek. Chen fell to the ground, first with his buttocks, then backwards. Thus, an arch-traitor who brought disaster to the country was punished by national law and met his demise. The following is a list of his belongings: a briefcase, a thermometer, a spirit lamp, a leather handbag, a wooden comb, a razor, a yellow and white fleece blanket wrapped in clothes, a shaving brush and bowl set, a package of books, a white sheet and blanket wrapped in bedding, two washbasins, two small scissors, two thermos bottles, a nail clipper, other miscellaneous items, and several tens of thousands of dollars in cash. The reporter also read his final judgment, which consisted of three parts. One was a reply to Li Lizhuang, and the other two were replies to Zhao Yuehan and Liu Tianyou, who resided in Shanghai. These are recorded separately below. The relationship between Zhao, Liu, and Chen remains a mystery. Chen's body is temporarily kept in the prison examination room. The prison has notified his servant Liu Tongchen, who resides at 65 Shicui Street, to inform Chen's family to come to Suzhou to collect the body.

### Supreme Court's Secondary Judgment

Supreme Court Special Criminal Judgment, Year 35, Jing Te Fu No. 129

Appellant: Chen Li Lizhuang, female, wife of Chen Gongbo, age 50, resident of 25 Ninghai Road, Nanjing.

Defendant: Chen Gongbo, male, age 55, resident of 64 North Beiping Road, Nanjing.

The above-named defendant was convicted of treason. The Jiangsu Provincial High Court rendered its decision on April 12th of the 35th year of the Republic of China, and the case was sent to this court for final review. The appellant also applied for review. This court's judgment is as follows:

Main Text

Original judgment affirmed.

Reasons

The original judgment found that the defendant, Chen Gongbo, was originally a member of the Chinese Nationalist Party and a confidant of the traitor Wang Zhaoming, repeatedly holding important positions in the central government. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, the Sino-Japanese War broke out. The enemy forces were rampant, and Shanghai soon fell. The capital was shaken. The National Government decided to fight a protracted war and moved west to Chongqing to plan a counteroffensive. The traitor Wang Zhaoming violated the established national policy and willingly accepted the use of the Japanese chieftain Konoe Fumimaro to secretly negotiate peace. The defendant was forced to follow Wang in participating in the deliberations. At Wang's invitation at the end of the 27th year, he went from Chengdu to Hanoi, Vietnam, to continue discussing the peace movement. Wang drafted a peace telegram, which was given to the defendant and Zhou Fohai to be published in Hong Kong to respond to Konoe's proposed three principles of peace, hoping to confuse the public and obstruct the central government's war effort. Wang then went to Shanghai to negotiate a basic peace plan with the Japanese invaders and establish a puppet regime. The defendant shuttled between Hong Kong and Shanghai, constantly participating in the matter. When the basic negotiations were finalized, on March 30th of the 29th year, they jointly organized the puppet Nationalist government in Nanjing. Wang became the puppet chairman, and the defendant became the puppet president of the Legislative Yuan. In May of the same year, he led a delegation to Japan in the name of a puppet envoy to pay tribute. Later, he also served concurrently as the puppet mayor of Shanghai. Under the protection of the Japanese invaders, he openly and formally signed the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty and issued the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration, recognizing Manchukuo to undermine the integrity of our country's territory. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he echoed the Japanese invaders, and in January of the 32nd year, he agreed in the name of the puppet Nationalist government to declare war on our allies, Great Britain and the United States, and concluded an alliance treaty with the Japanese invaders. Later, he visited Japan in the name of a puppet ambassador. In March of the following year, Wang went to Japan for medical treatment, and the defendant acted as the puppet chairman of the Nationalist government and the puppet chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, from which the military and political power of the puppet government was solely under his control. After Wang's death, he formally acted as puppet chairman and concurrently served as the puppet president of the Executive Yuan. In his capacity as puppet head of state, he visited the Japanese emperor, expressing that he would continue Wang's legacy, live and die with the Japanese invaders, and complete the mission of the Greater East Asia War. Because the Japanese invaders surrendered, he fled in fear of punishment and hid in Japan. He was ordered by telegram to be arrested and sent back to the country and taken to the court for prosecution. The evidence on which this is based is that the defendant and Wang Zhaoming jointly organized the puppet Nationalist government, held various important puppet positions, and succeeded Wang in leading the puppet government after Wang's death, monopolizing puppet power, occupying Nanjing, and issuing orders. His own confession is undeniable, and there are records of him presiding over meetings and handling official duties. In the puppet Shanghai Municipal Gazette, there are official documents issued by the defendant in his capacity as puppet mayor. It was separately discovered that the defendant, in the name of the puppet Nationalist government's acting chairman, appointed Chu Minyi as the puppet governor of Guangdong Province and the puppet pacification director of Guangzhou, etc., which can be used as proof. Regarding how Wang told him about the secret peace plot with the Japanese invaders before leaving Chongqing, inviting him to go to Hanoi, Vietnam, to send a peace telegram to support the peace declaration of the enemy chieftain Konoe Fumimaro, and how he was summoned by Wang to Shanghai to negotiate the basic relationship treaty with the Japanese invaders, and how after the establishment of the puppet government, he went to Japan in the name of a puppet envoy to pay tribute and subsequently issued the "Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration," openly recognizing "Manchukuo," and how after the outbreak of the Pacific War, he declared war on Britain and the United States in the name of the puppet Nationalist government, and signed the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, repeatedly traveling to Japan to visit the enemy chieftain, declaring that he would live and die with them, his confession and statements in the original court are all detailed. Cross-referencing the "Record of the Puppet Nationalist Government Delegation's Visit to Japan," "Collection of Speeches of Chen Gongbo's Visit to Japan," "Conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Treaty and the Greater East Asia War," published by the Puppet Propaganda Department, and the "Theory and Implementation of the Political Program of the Puppet Nationalist Government," published by the Political Monthly Society, as well as the records in the "Puppet Shanghai Municipal Gazette" and the "Overseas News Clippings Book," are all consistent. The defendant colluded with Wang Zhaoming to conspire with the Japanese invaders, secretly negotiated peace, established a puppet regime, and openly betrayed the central government. The evidence of his treason is very clear. The defendant's defenses, including (1) that the party cannot be divided and the country must be unified, so he did not agree with Wang's departure from Chongqing and the organization of the puppet government, and repeatedly tried to dissuade him without success, only because the relationship was too deep that he could not bear to leave abruptly, (2) that he always opposed the Sino-Japanese Basic Relationship Treaty, repeatedly requested its abolition, and interceded with the Japanese invaders to abolish Manchukuo, (3) that the peace negotiations with the Japanese invaders were to achieve overall peace, so he never had hostile behavior towards the Chongqing government, and although the puppet government declared war on Britain and the United States, it did not actually send troops, and its purpose was only to avoid the Japanese invaders from plundering materials, and (4) that the people in the occupied areas suffered greatly, and in the gazette of the puppet Legislative Yuan, the defendant, in his capacity as the puppet president, was provided with the opportunity to rescue them by the puppet government. The vitality of the country depends on...

### The Arrest of the False Mayor of Jinan, Zhu Guishan, in Beiping; Tao Xisan, a Traitor, Sentenced to Two Years Imprisonment

[This newspaper's Beiping dispatch, 3rd] Zhu Guishan, the false mayor of Jinan, was arrested in Beiping on the 28th of last month. After the victory, Zhu changed his name to Yuan Yan and hid in Lu's residence at No. 33 Zhufu Granary Street, Xiyu. The Preparedness Department detected him some time ago and made the arrest.

[Central News Agency Nanjing dispatch, 3rd] The case of Tao Xisan (protected), the head of the false Nanjing Local Maintenance Association, was announced by the Capital High Court at 2 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd. The defendant was sentenced to two years of imprisonment, deprived of public rights for three years, and all assets were confiscated except for a discretionary amount for the necessary living expenses of his family. The traitor Tao is already nearing his twilight years, but it is said that he still protested and applied for retrial after hearing the verdict. He cited five reasons to maintain his innocence, including preserving a significant amount of wealth, and maintaining Nanjing's security after the Japanese surrender to await the arrival of the National Army, subsequently going to Japan to await orders, and not fleeing. However, the court stated regarding the first point that Wang Jingwei colluded with the Japanese invaders and betrayed the central government. If, as the defendant claimed, he had tried to dissuade Wang in vain, he should have weighed the importance of the matter and decided on his course of action. Instead, the defendant responded to Wang's call and secretly went to Hanoi, where he sent a pro-peace telegram on Wang's behalf, and then jointly organized the puppet National Government in Nanjing, assuming important positions. After Wang's death, he succeeded to his position and held the highest provincial office, and on the 13th anniversary of the founding of Manchukuo, he broadcast a statement declaring his inheritance of Wang Jingwei's legacy, working closely with Japan and Manchukuo for mutual prosperity. This broadcast speech is evidenced by a record from an enemy radio station, which proves that the defendant abandoned righteousness for personal gain, sacrificing everything to engage in acts that forfeited national sovereignty and brought shame upon the country. Although he showed utmost loyalty to Wang Jingwei, he caused immense harm to the country and the nation. Furthermore, the defendant relied on the protection of the Japanese invaders and seized control of the southeast, which already formed a divided situation. He also organized the puppet Kuomintang and convened the Sixth National Congress, using it as a means of rallying support, which contradicted the idea that the party cannot be divided and the country must be unified. Regarding the second point, according to the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, Japan had the right to station troops in Mengjiang and North China, station fleets in China's territorial waters, and carry out economic cooperation, allowing the Japanese invaders to infringe on sovereignty and plunder resources. The defendant himself knew that this was an unequal and harsh treaty, yet he agreed with Wang Jingwei to have it passed by the puppet Legislative Yuan, which he headed. This would have subjected China to their control and permanently reduced it to a Japanese appendage, sacrificing the country and the nation at any cost. Even if he had expressed opposition beforehand and requested a cessation afterward, he could not shirk responsibility. Moreover, after this basic treaty, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was subsequently signed, establishing an alliance with the enemy country, which became even closer and ran counter to the central government's policy of resistance against Japan, resulting in conflicting interests. Furthermore, the defendant initially issued a joint declaration with Wang Jingwei of China, Japan, and Manchukuo, and later, on February 26th of the 34th year of the Republic, broadcast a celebration of the 13th anniversary of the founding of the puppet Manchukuo, consistently recognizing the existence of Manchukuo. The impact of this was sufficient to undermine the integrity of China's territory. He still argues tenaciously that he negotiated with the Japanese invaders to abolish Manchukuo, but who can believe it? Regarding the third point, the defendant agreed with Wang Jingwei to make peace with the Japanese invaders, which was far from the national policy of resisting Japan, and he also betrayed the central government and formed a puppet government. In the puppet Central Political Conference, it was resolved that "after the National Government returns to the capital, all domestic and foreign decrees, treaties, agreements, and contracts of Chongqing would be invalid, all troops should immediately cease fighting and await orders, and all civil servants should report to Nanjing within the shortest period." This is recorded in the book "The Theory and Implementation of the Political Program of the Puppet National Government." This resolution falsely claimed that "the National Government has returned to the capital" while denying the existence of the Chongqing government, clearly revealing its desire to eliminate the central government and usurp its position. The claim that there was never any hostile action against the Chongqing government is self-defeating. Furthermore, according to our country's established policy, we should unite with the British and American democratic front to resist the Axis powers of Germany and Japan, but the defendant and Wang Jingwei established a puppet regime and joined hands with the enemy country Japan, brazenly declaring war on our British and American allies. Their goal was to rely on the Axis powers, destroy Britain and America, and isolate our central government's resistance against Japan in order to achieve their traitorous plot, which is extremely clear. The claim that this was to resist the Japanese plunder of resources is also a deceptive statement. Regarding the fourth point, because the Japanese invaders lacked the ability to control the occupied areas, they created puppet governments for their own use, in order to achieve their goal of controlling China with Chinese and sustaining the war with war. After the defendant and Wang Jingwei organized the puppet government, they catered to the wishes of the Japanese invaders, and the corrupt policies implemented in the occupied areas, such as plundering resources, issuing counterfeit currency, selling opium through public monopolies, and enslaving the youth through village clearing and blockades, were all actions that harmed the country and the people. This can be seen in the files of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government obtained by the original court and the telegrams between the defendant and Chu Minyi seized in another case. All of the above were evil schemes originating from the Japanese invaders' political aggression, and the depth of the harm they caused was more than enough to destroy the country and exterminate the race. The defendant still claims to have rescued the people and preserved their vitality, which is the opposite of the truth. Regarding the fifth point, since the puppet government was a puppet organization, it lost its basis after the Japanese invaders surrendered and was bound to disintegrate at the same time. At that time, the Japanese General Okamura Neiji and others were awaiting orders in Nanjing, and before the National Army arrived, they should still abide by the surrender orders and be responsible for maintaining local order, which did not require the defendant's assistance. Moreover, the defendant only had a small number of remaining troops stationed in Nanjing, which was even less important. Even if he had ordered his subordinates to jointly maintain security with the enemy troops, it was because he was at his wit's end and had no choice but to submit. How could he hope to be forgiven for this? Furthermore, if the defendant was sincerely awaiting punishment, he should have awaited orders in Nanjing regardless of the circumstances, but he hurriedly fled to Japan. Isn't that fleeing out of fear of punishment? Therefore, it is determined that the above defenses are nothing more than embellishments in the hope of reducing or exempting himself from guilt, and are all unacceptable. According to [missing text], then [missing text] violated [missing text] principle, apart from still requesting the defendant's original [missing text] that the party cannot be divided and the country must be unified. His following Wang Jingwei was due to the [missing text] feeling that he could not [missing text] sever, and he supported the party and the country, supported [missing text] and had measures to unify the country [missing text] to show. Therefore, he pointed [missing text] out that the original trial did not conduct [missing text] the investigation [missing text] and said that the public defender appointed by the original trial was unable to [missing text] see the defendant before the trial date to fully prepare [missing text] to develop his ability to attack and defend, and that the original trial did not [missing text] use the provisions of discretion [missing text] and surrender, [missing text] and that the extreme penalty was imposed, which were all points that he could not accept, etc. It should be known that the defendant, in fact, followed Wang Jingwei in making peace with the enemy, which ran counter to the central government's established policy of resistance against Japan, and relied on the enemy's protection [missing text] to reorganize the puppet party and establish another regime to confront our central government. This clearly showed his intention and behavior of colluding with the enemy country and plotting to resist his own country. The crime was already established. Even if he had other intentions or different opinions that were completely different from what he had implemented, it would not be related to the establishment of his crime. Moreover, considering the means of the defendant's crime and the harm caused by the crime, the circumstances were extremely serious, and it cannot be said that he should be reduced in punishment because he had one or two measures to assist in the resistance against Japan. There is no need to investigate matters related to these defenses again. Since the defendant did not voluntarily surrender and be tried after the crime was not discovered, it does not comply with the provisions on surrender in the Criminal Law and the Regulations on the Surrender of Traitors, and therefore, the original judgment cannot be criticized for not [missing text] using this provision improperly. Even if the public defender Shang Rong appointed by the original trial did not meet with the defendant before the [missing text] trial date, he defended the defendant in court on the trial date, which is not enough [missing text] [missing text] [missing text] [missing text] why not [missing text], then the [missing text] appeal intention is also completely unacceptable. The original judgment was based on the [missing text] matter [missing text] determined that the defendant was an accomplice in colluding with the enemy country [missing text] to resist the original [missing text] sin, and used the fact that Japan [missing text] to annex our country as its conspiracy. After the September 18th Incident [missing text] occupied our four northeastern provinces and established the so-called Manchu Empire. The clan then sent troops to Inner Mongolia and advanced [missing text] Peace [missing text], which evolved into the July 7th Incident. Our country endured [missing text] and in order to seek the survival of the nation, we rose up to resist, and the whole country went to national disaster to fight for the final victory. The defendant was originally a central government official and should have understood this deeply. However, due to the slight setbacks of our army in the early stages of the war, his intentions [missing text] were shaken and he followed Wang Jingwei, willing to be used by the Japanese invaders. At a time when the [missing text] trend reversed and every hair was critical, he secretly left and sent a telegram advocating peace. Then he formed a puppet government and betrayed the central government, and concluded an alliance with the Japanese invaders, brazenly declaring war on our British and American allies, repeatedly undermining the national policy of resistance against Japan, and helping the Japanese invaders to invade, which would have plunged the country and the nation into a state of irreparable disaster. He was truly ignorant of the big picture and willing to be a criminal. There was nothing to be pitied about in law. Therefore, according to Article 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, Article 2, Paragraph 1, and Article 28 of the Criminal Law, Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, Article 37, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, Article 8, Paragraph 1 and Article 9 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, he was sentenced to death, deprived of public rights for life, and all his property was confiscated except for a discretionary amount for the necessary living expenses of his family. The judgment of guilt and punishment was all appropriate and should be approved. Based on the above, it should be decided according to Article 20, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations, the judgment is as follows: Zhang Yuxun, Presiding Judge of the Second Criminal Division of the Supreme Court, Yin Baixu, Lin Shangbin, Luo Renji, Chen Shicheng, Clerk Li Bangfeng, May 16, 35th year of the Republic of China. [Whitespace] [Whitespace] [Whitespace] and Feng, the chief engineer of the Haitang Salvation Committee, were injured. This newspaper's reporter was also slightly injured.

### The Capital High Court Opened a Trial Yesterday to Try the Female Traitor Mo Guokang; The Court Debate Concluded and the Verdict Will Be Announced on the Afternoon of the 10th

[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 3rd] Mo Guokang, the concubine of Chen Gongbo, who was executed in Suzhou this morning, appeared in the Capital High Court at 2 PM this afternoon. Because Chen was a teacher at the school, after working in the party department, he often met Chen at [Sun] Yat-sen's residence. From the 15th year of the Republic, he participated in the Northern Expedition and also belonged to Chen's subordinates. After the completion of the Northern Expedition, Mo began to serve Chen, playing the role of "caring for" him, but stating that she herself was not "married." Regarding going to Nanjing from Chongqing, she said that Chen invited her to take a look at what was happening and intended to try to save the situation, not to advocate peace, and she did not participate in politics. She also flatly denied (1) that she had been involved in Sino-Japanese treaties during her tenure as a puppet Legislative Yuan member, and (2) that she had been a general secretary of the puppet Political Security Department, acting as a substitute for the director, Chen, and pretended not to know that the department was a special agency. Subsequently, Liu Xingwu, a staff member of the Second Bureau of the puppet Political Security Department, and Yu Xiaochen, the deputy director of the accounting office, were summoned to the court to confront the defendant, but no facts were obtained. Finally, Mo also said that she never criticized the resistance against Japan, never criticized the supreme leader, and did her best to help patriotic people. At the beginning of the debate, the defendant added that going to Japan was to take care of Chen, and she definitely did not flee to escape punishment. She said, "Of course, I will be with my friend to the end." At this point, the presiding judge asked again, "Chen has been sentenced to death. What are your thoughts?" Mo smiled weakly and replied, "Whatever the government decides, that's how it is. I have no thoughts." Then she said, "I only feel that he sacrificed himself for his friends." Subsequently, the appointed defense lawyer stood up to defend her. At the end of the court session, it was announced that the debate on this case was over and that the verdict would be announced at the High Court at 10 AM on the 10th before adjourning.

Editorial

### The Grave and Perilous Foreign Trade!

Yesterday, this newspaper reported that since the victory, European and American shipping companies have resumed operations one after another, and large numbers of ships have arrived one after another. However, prices in this city are higher than in other countries, which has led to a decrease in exports. Most foreign ships are returning home empty. What a profound picture this is! This is a chronic disease that can lead to national decline! The reason for this is not solely the fault of the citizens of Shanghai, but the people of Shanghai are watching this dangerous situation without shouting out in pain! They are still carefree and laughing, which is truly strange and absurd. Although overseas shipping has not yet returned to its former glory in the past eight or nine months, goods for general civilian use have been arriving steadily. Today, the Shanghai market is full of foreign goods. Cotton and wheat are not to mention, even minor items such as orange soda, candy, cigarettes, and even soap bubbles for children to play with are all supplied from abroad, while our exports are almost zero, causing foreign ships to return home empty. To put it jokingly, if we continue on this path and do not change, then what we eat, wear, live in, and use will all become "American equipment." If there is only import and no export, where will trade balance come from? In terms of the balance of international payments, remittances from overseas Chinese, church income, and travel income have all sharply declined, which puts us in an absolutely unfavorable position in the balance of international payments. If this continues to develop, our nation's economic life will inevitably suffer from anemia and wither away. If the authorities have not yet seen this serious disease, it is unwise; if they have already seen it but do not quickly try to save it, it is inhumane!

The reasons for this serious disease are not simple, and the fundamental solution may require striving for political stability. However, this anemic disease, which is on the verge of death, cannot wait for the political problem to be delayed. We must quickly take necessary and appropriate measures in the economic field. Wang Yunwu, the newly appointed Minister of Economic Affairs, comes from the people and should know the hardships of the people's livelihood; he runs a business and should know the industrial crisis. After taking office, what medicine will he use for this dangerous disease? This is what we urgently want to know.

In our opinion, the disease is critically ill, and it may be too late to rescue it quickly. On the positive side, the government should immediately strictly control imported goods. Because under the current general circumstances, foreign prices are lower than those in our country, so even if tariffs are adjusted, it will be of no avail. For example, if a certain commodity is imported, even with the addition of freight and an import tax of 100% or 200%, it is still cheaper than domestically produced goods. An import tax of 100% or even 200% is already the application of tariff policy, but it may still not be able to achieve the goal of curbing imports. Even if foreign exchange is not provided, merchants can still order with US dollars, so the allocation of foreign exchange cannot limit imports. For the sake of the present, it seems that a licensing system should be adopted for import trade. Some commodities that are not necessary to import, or that people can live without consuming, should be prohibited from import. The government can stipulate the highest monthly or annual import quota and not allow free import. At present, the reversal of our country's foreign trade is mostly due to the government's almost pure laissez-faire attitude towards import trade, with at most only the application of some tariff policies. Furthermore, the circulation of US dollars in our country's market is enough to undermine our foreign exchange allocation methods. If this laissez-faire policy is allowed to continue, it will inevitably bankrupt our nation. We must quickly adopt an import control and quota licensing policy, and at the same time absolutely prohibit the use of US dollars in the market in order to strengthen foreign exchange control, so that we can save the current decline.

On the positive side, we must quickly encourage exports. Our silk, tea, tung oil, tungsten, zinc, and pig bristles are all major export commodities. Among them, silk and pig bristles, etc., now have substitutes in foreign countries, and their production prices are lower than those of our country's local products. The main reason for the sluggishness of our foreign export trade is that our country's commodity production costs are too high and cannot compete with others in the international market. For example, if farmers raise silkworms and sell cocoons, they cannot cover the cost of mulberry leaves and labor, and reeling silk for sale cannot even cover the cost of cocoons. If this continues, not only will industry go bankrupt, but agriculture will also go bankrupt. Moreover, transportation has not yet been fully restored, materials cannot circulate, which makes prices soar and exports stagnate. With such a difference between domestic and foreign prices, if the government does not consider revising the exchange rate for export trade, or adopting a subsidy policy, we dare to say that foreign ships will always return home empty. To put it another way, if we only see foreign goods being imported and not local products being exported for a year and a half, then one day even if foreign goods are imported, there will be no customers to buy them, because everyone's blood will be almost drained!

In short, if the government still has an economic policy, it should start with this big picture and quickly use licensing and quota methods to strictly control imported goods. On the other hand, it should revise the exchange rate or subsidize the losses of exporters so that exported local products can also be sold at low prices in overseas markets. It is necessary to make our country's export trade, which has shrunk for eight years, recover and prosper in order to avoid the fate of economic subjugation! Otherwise, China will not only have no hope of becoming an industrial country, but it will not even be qualified to be a dependent agricultural country. How serious, how dangerous!

### Guangdong-Siam Rice Resold in Hong Kong; Executive Yuan Investigating the Scandal; City Council Dissatisfied with Ling Daoyang's Remarks

[This newspaper's Guangzhou dispatch, 31st] Ling Daoyang, Director of the Guangdong Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, made remarks in Shanghai on May 17 regarding the distribution of rice. The City Council here is very dissatisfied. The council believes that the relief work was jointly handled by nine agencies convened by the Executive Yuan. The council and the Youth League are only responsible for supervision and assistance. The main personnel of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration are still responsible for the overall success. Now, the Executive Yuan is sending personnel to investigate the scandal of reselling rice in Hong Kong. The director of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration actually made remarks in Shanghai, attempting to cover up the scandal. The council and the Youth League will raise questions when Director Ling returns to Guangdong.

Led by Director General Lin Zhan, the group inspected the 21st Army and its subordinate units. All officers and soldiers displayed high morale and agility. On the 1st, accompanied by Army Commander Liu, they went to Shanghai to inspect the 46th Division and its subordinate units.

Changshu

Police Precincts to be Merged by Deadline: As all district self-defense forces have been organized effectively, and upon the recommendation of the Provisional Assembly, it has been approved to merge the police precincts in each district and reduce the number of police personnel as much as possible. The goal is to improve the salaries of the remaining officers.

Promoting Rice Borer Control: The First Agricultural Work Team of the Su-Ning Branch previously dispatched technicians Zhou Likun, Cui Boquan, and others to Suzhou to carry out rice borer control work. They have successively established over ten rice borer control associations in townships such as Yong'an and mobilized farmers to create suitable seedbeds, provide guidance on egg mass management, and use moth-attracting lamps. To attract farmers' attention, a rice borer control demonstration area has been set up outside the gate, using labor-for-relief methods for control and planning to distribute DDT powder to enhance the effectiveness of control.

Wuxi

Special Tax on Fresh Cocoons Exempted: The silk cocoon industry in this county has reached its lowest point. Silk merchants lose one million yuan per dan (unit of weight) of silk reeled. Farmers raising silkworms also suffer losses due to low cocoon prices and increased costs, leading to the removal of mulberry trees and the planting of rice paddies. Fortunately, the request to exempt the special tax on fresh cocoons has been approved by the provincial government. On the afternoon of the 31st, at 3:00 PM, the Cocoon Merchants Guild convened a temporary meeting, inviting over forty representatives from licensed cocoon businesses to discuss fresh cocoon prices and other important matters. The following decisions were made: (1) The price shall not be lower than the price stipulated by the Construction Bureau, which is 116,000 yuan per market picul (dan). (2) All businesses will open scales on June 3rd. (3) A deposit of 70,000 yuan will be temporarily set for each business, including 6,000 yuan for the brokerage license tax. The guild fee will be 500 yuan per market picul for each dry business, and the direct tax will be 750 yuan per market picul. (4) Those operating privately without permission will be banned. (5) Military police will be stationed in the businesses for protection. (6) An additional deposit of 40,000 yuan will be temporarily set for each cocoon business.

Jiangdu

Security in Yangzhou City is Assured: Since the surrender of the enemy and the subsequent occupation of Gaoyou and Shaobo Town in the county by the Communist army, coupled with the constant flow of displaced people passing through or residing in Yangzhou from the Li-Xia-He area, numbering in the thousands daily, the people inevitably feel unsettled. Furthermore, the Communist army has launched attacks and provocations against the National Army's positions, resulting in over a hundred battles, large and small, in recent months. After newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai revealed this, people from all walks of life expressed concern about the security of Yangzhou. Recently, senior officers of the National Army stationed in Yangzhou stated that their strict adherence to their posts is in compliance with the supreme authority's "Ceasefire Agreement" and the implementation of the ceasefire order. The Communist forces within Yangzhou County are estimated to have a strength of about one brigade, currently occupying the areas of Shaobo, Qiao, Fanchuan, and Gou towns. The National Army, adhering to the attitude of complying with the ceasefire order and for self-defense, will not allow the Communist forces to advance further and will firmly defend its existing positions. Therefore, the security of Yangzhou can be assured.

Eastern and Northern Anhui Suffer Calamities: The area around Donghu and Xihu in Qiuzhi County, northern Anhui, has become a bandit den. Last year, the provincial government established the Four-County Bandit Suppression Headquarters in Sanhejian to suppress and kill a large number of bandit leaders nearby, and the region was finally peaceful. This spring, with the headquarters disbanded, prices have risen again, and the people are struggling. The latent bandits in the county have risen again, and after disarming the Yongsui Township Office and the self-defense forces, they have become even more rampant. The other day, they even raided Ye Jiaji and He Kouji, looting extensively. Currently, bandits are everywhere in the Sanyuan Dian, Dao Ji Miao, and Xi Gao Ji areas, and the people are fleeing. The county government, with its weak forces, is telegraphing the Second Special Security Commissioner's Office stationed in Lihuang to send troops to assist in suppression to prevent the situation from spreading. Furthermore, the Communist forces in Xuyi, Wuhe, Tianchang, Laian, and Jiashan in eastern Anhui are now advancing eastward towards the Jinpu Railway, harassing the people west of the railway. When they fail to coerce the people to follow them, they demolish houses, cut down crops, loot grain, dig up the Huai Dike, and indiscriminately slaughter returning youths and gentry. The people of each county are suffering from the loss of life and property, and they urgently hope that the National Army will be stationed west of the railway to relieve their suffering.

Upon hearing this, Anhui senators Ma Jingchang and Chen Tie, aware that the enemy grain received in various places has been ordered by the Executive Yuan to the Chairman of the National Government to be used for disaster relief by the General Headquarters of the Army, and seeing that there are over a million refugees wandering in the northeastern counties of Anhui, starving and desperate, have specifically requested the branch office to postpone the auction and telegraph the Executive Yuan to quickly issue a stop order and transfer the grain to the relief distribution office for distribution to benefit the disaster victims.

### Soviet Union Continues to Criticize Britain and the United States, Accusing Their Policies of Aiming to Eliminate International Cooperation, British Foreign Secretary to Respond Sternly in Parliament

[Reuters, London, 2nd (Dispatch)] The Moscow radio station's criticism of British and American foreign policy seems to have reached its peak today. Foreign Secretary Bevin may respond sternly during the debate in the House of Commons this week. London officials are deeply concerned about the Soviet radio station and newspapers' criticism of Britain and the United States. Moscow radio today broadcast an article from the New Era magazine, launching an unprecedentedly fierce attack on British and American policies, accusing the measures implemented by Britain and the United States of completely eliminating the hope of international cooperation. Whether international relations will change in the future depends on the policies of Britain and the United States. Restoring the spirit of wartime cooperation or continuing today's policy of forcing other countries to accept their opinions could lead to two completely different situations in future international relations.

[Reuters, Moscow, 2nd (Dispatch)] Soviet newspapers and radio stations have recently continuously criticized the policies implemented by the United States in the occupied zone of Germany, denouncing them as "illegal, brutal," and not complying with the joint resolutions of the Allied powers. Moscow radio criticized General Clay, the Deputy Military Governor of the US-occupied zone of Germany, for refusing to transfer reparations materials, believing that this move is sufficient to foster the monopoly of certain German industries, as most Hitlerite industrialists still occupy leading positions in various economic sectors of Germany. The "News Bulletin" criticized the four-nation treaty on guaranteeing German disarmament proposed by US Secretary of State Byrnes, believing that it intends to avoid complying with the joint resolutions of the Allied powers.

[Reuters also reported] The "Propagandist Magazine," the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, stated: American soldiers strictly seal off information on atomic energy, preventing it from being used for peaceful industrial purposes. The United States is only engaged in the military use of atomic energy, so atomic energy has not yet been developed for peaceful industrial purposes. This is all due to the consistent use of power diplomacy by the United States.

### Eleanor Roosevelt Advocates US-Soviet Friendship

### Standing Army Retains 3 Million, Soviet Union Continues to Reduce its Armed Forces, Over 10 Million Soldiers Discharged in the Past Ten Months, Focus on Atomic Energy Research

[Associated Press, Nuremberg, Germany, 1st (Dispatch)] An Allied official said today: In the past ten months, the Soviet Union has discharged over 10 million soldiers. The military service age has been reduced from 55 to 29. There are still 6 million armed forces, including 4.5 million in the army and 1.57 million in the navy and air force, and it is prepared to continue reducing them. Approximately, the Soviet Union has a total of 3 million standing and reserve forces. The Soviet Union is now giving the highest priority to research on the application of atomic energy to military equipment or major heavy industries. Soviet scientists and technicians are working diligently to catch up with the achievements of the United States, Britain, and Canada in jointly researching atomic energy. United Nations envoys in Moscow believe that Soviet scientists undoubtedly know the secrets of atomic bomb manufacturing, but it is expected that Soviet factories will not be able to create a perfect atomic bomb before 1948 or 1949. Although the Soviet Red Army has been reduced, it is still the most powerful army in the world. In an emergency, the expansion of the Red Army is faster than the armies of Western countries, and this time, a fundamental downsizing is being implemented. Special encouragement is given to junior officers who have fought on the battlefield for a long time to re-enter the military, taking their combat experience. Anti-British propaganda has now been heard in Moscow, and the Soviet Union has manufactured light military vehicles similar to the American jeep, the world's largest tanks, and rocket-propelled aircraft. The US Embassy in the Soviet Union held a formal reception on US Army Day, but only one Soviet general attended, so the highest-ranking US military officer in the Soviet Union did not attend the Soviet military parade on May Day.

### Laski's Talk: British Labor Government Can Last for 20 Years

[Reuters, London, 2nd (Dispatch)] Labor Party Chairman Laski gave a speech in Newcastle today, predicting that the Labor government has a hope of lasting up to 20 years. The whole country generally supports the Labor government's social programs. The upcoming independence of India is also a major event in modern history. Laski also mentioned the disagreement with Bevin's political views, but also said that Bevin's reputation has increased since taking office ten months ago. Many oppose Bevin's policies towards Greece, and I also disagree with the government's Spanish policy. I feel that we should support the demands of Germany, the Soviet Union, and Poland, and eliminate Spain's reign of terror. When Bevin first took office, he advocated that British troops occupy Indonesia. I know that there was no other way at the time. Now he, Sir Cole, and Vice-Governor Van Mook have a new plan for Indonesian freedom. I hope that the British will not support Indonesia being exploited by the Netherlands.

The defendants on trial are twenty-six Japanese war criminals responsible for the massacre of millions of Chinese.

Regarding the defense's request for an adjournment, American lawyer Captain Herman stood up and said that some American defense attorneys had just arrived yesterday, so he hoped the court would allow reasonable time to study the evidence and consult with the war criminals. After a fifteen-minute recess, Presiding Judge Webb announced an adjournment until June 13th, giving them ten days to prepare all the evidence for their defense.

[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] Tokyo U.S. Military Police Commander Allen today denied rumors broadcast by a U.S. radio reporter that Japanese die-hards plotted to assassinate MacArthur last week, saying, "I have no knowledge of this matter. One hundred Japanese police officers, a U.S. military unit, and military police have been added to strengthen security along the route from the U.S. Embassy, MacArthur's residence, to headquarters. If it were true, I would know." The head of the counterintelligence department at headquarters, Cresswell, also said that the rumor was unfounded.

### Proposal to Sever Relations with Franco Government Receives Favorable Reactions from Various Countries, Security Council to Meet to Discuss the Day After Tomorrow

[Report] A broadcast from San Francisco on the 3rd: The Security Council Subcommittee, in its report on the investigation of the Franco regime, declared that it had no legal right to take action against possible aggressors. The U.S. government expressed dissatisfaction with this. After reviewing the report, the U.S. State Department may revise the point on various countries severing relations with Spain. Severing relations may cause the Spanish people to resent foreign interference.

[United Press, New York, 2nd] The United Nations Committee to Investigate the Spanish Question proposed that if the Franco government does not step down by September, the entire world should sever relations with it. Representatives of the United Nations Security Council today expressed favorable reactions to this. However, some of the Committee's recommendations will encounter varying degrees of opposition. The Council is scheduled to meet on the 6th to discuss it. Representatives from five parties acknowledge that the Committee's proposal for the United Nations General Assembly to initiate the severance of relations with Franco is surprising, as the Council has repeatedly hesitated to do so. It is difficult to determine whether there will be strong opposition in the future that will cause significant changes to the Committee's recommendation. This report has been supported by the Committee's members from China, France, Argentina, the Netherlands, and Brazil, making it difficult for any of the other six representatives on the Council to gather enough votes to make significant changes. Brazilian representative Valesco has remained neutral on this proposal but believes that there will not be any major changes. A spokesperson for the U.S. delegation expressed the same view. The key is the attitude of the Soviet Union. Soviet representative Gromyko has not yet reacted, but representatives expect that he will oppose some points in the report based on his previous stance. The points that are most likely to be opposed are: (1) The Security Council has no right to direct the severance of relations with Spain, as the Spanish government is only regarded as a possible, not an actual, threat to international peace; (2) Handing the case over to the United Nations General Assembly. According to the United Nations Charter, the passage of this report requires a certain number of necessary votes, including the five permanent members of the Security Council: China, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union. If the Soviet Union casts a negative vote, the Committee's recommendation will be invalid. However, Gromyko may take the same attitude as he did when the Committee was established on April 29th and express his opposition by abstaining from voting. One recommendation that is expected to be passed unanimously without opposition is the Council's endorsement of the joint declaration of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France on March 4th, which called on the Spanish people to overthrow the Franco government by peaceful means and establish a provisional government pending free elections.

Conclusions and Recommendations of the Report

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 3rd] The conclusions and recommendations of the report of the United Nations Security Council Committee on the Spanish Question are recorded below:

(1) (A) Although the actions of the Franco regime do not currently constitute a threat to peace, as interpreted by Article 39 of the Charter, preventing the Council from ordering or authorizing the execution of the steps stipulated in Articles 40 or 42 of the Charter, these actions have indeed created a situation that poses a threat to international peace and security. Therefore, as interpreted by Article 34 of the Charter, this situation is likely to endanger international peace and security; (B) Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Article 36, paragraph 1, the Council has the right to recommend appropriate procedures or methods to address the situation described in paragraph A.

(2) The final question is what steps the Subcommittee should recommend to the Security Council. After careful consideration, the Subcommittee believes it should take effective and appropriate steps to deal with this particular event, and considering the important powers retained by the United Nations General Assembly under Article 10 of the Charter, it proposes the following recommendations: (A) The Security Council should support the principles listed in the joint declaration of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France on March 4, 1946. (B) The Security Council should forward the evidence and report submitted by this Subcommittee and the following recommendations to the United Nations General Assembly. If the General Assembly does not cancel the Franco regime and realize the political freedoms described in the declaration, the General Assembly should pass a resolution recommending that each member state of the United Nations immediately sever diplomatic relations with the Franco regime. (C) The Secretary-General of the United Nations should take appropriate steps to notify all member states of the United Nations and other relevant countries of these recommendations.

(3) If the General Assembly believes that all the conditions stipulated in the declaration of March 4, 1946, have been fully realized, including the cancellation of the Franco regime, the declaration of a political amnesty, the return of exiled Spanish people, the opening of freedom of political assembly and association, and the implementation of free and open elections, the Subcommittee proposes that the Assembly give good faith consideration to a freely elected Spanish government applying to join the United Nations.

### Retrial of Li Ze Case: Two Witnesses Testified; Court Adjourns for Sentencing on the 8th; Shu Yueqiao Demands Confiscation of All the Defendant's Assets; Prosecutor Claims Motive for Accusation is Irrelevant

(Report from this Newspaper) The sensational case of Li Ze, general manager of the Sun-Sun Company, suspected of being a traitor, was previously brought to a conclusion by Chief Judge Liu Yugui of the Special Criminal Court of the High Court, with sentencing scheduled for the 7th of last month. Subsequently, due to Li Ze's testimony involving the "Commerce and Trade Control Association" (商統會) case, the High Court deemed it necessary to investigate, and in accordance with Article 284 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a retrial was held yesterday. The defense called witnesses Cai Ziwo and Mu Yunbo, who testified that Shu Yueqiao's behavior was improper, and that he engaged in extortion, and when it was unsuccessful, he engaged in malicious publicity and then made accusations. Shu absolutely denied this, stating that they were fabricating accusations out of thin air and speaking nonsense. Another accuser, Han Wucheng, stated, "We, all of my colleagues, are willing to guarantee Shu Yueqiao's character with our lives. His accusation against Li Ze is completely out of a sense of justice." Furthermore, Shu Yueqiao demanded that all of Li Ze's assets be confiscated and distributed to impoverished compatriots. After further arguments by the defendant's lawyers, Zhang Shijian and Chen Yunrui, the court adjourned for sentencing at 2:30 PM on the 8th of this month.

At 3:10 PM yesterday, the courtroom was already packed with spectators, the majority being employees of the Sun-Sun Company and family and friends of Li Ze. Li Ze was then brought into the courtroom by court police. Li wore a dark gray silk long gown, with white socks visible at the hem, and dark yellow leather shoes. His hands were tied behind his back. After he stood in the defendant's dock, Chief Judge Liu announced the reason for the retrial and instructed the court clerk to read the transcripts of the previous hearing. Shu Yueqiao and others stated that there were no errors. Li Ze corrected two points: (1) Wen Lanting succeeded Tang Shoumin in managing the "Commerce and Trade Control Association" in August of the 33rd year of the Republic; (2) Of the over 20,000 pieces of cotton yarn and cloth purchased by the "Commerce and Trade Control Association," the Japanese only took away over 60 pieces. The witness Cai Ziwo was then called. Cai is from Zhongshan, Guangdong, 50 years old, and is reportedly a close relative of Li Ze. He resides on Lloyd Road but claimed not to know the house number. He also claimed that he previously worked in the security department of the Sun-Sun Company and is currently the director of the general affairs department. He doesn't often see Shu Yueqiao but knows that Shu is motivated by money. He initially demanded eleven gold bars, which Li Ze refused. Later, he reduced the demand to seven bars, but that was also refused. Finally, he reduced the demand to three bars, but it was still not given. The judge asked Li Ze, who also said that this was true. However, Shu Yueqiao said:

They fabricated accusations out of thin air and spoke nonsense. My accusation against Li Ze for being a traitor is based entirely on the people's sense of justice. When questioned again, Li Ze claimed that Shu's usual conduct was often improper. He was later introduced to the New Capital Hotel, but it was the same. He was repeatedly advised to change, but he did not. He even cursed loudly in public and incited strikes, which led to the police being called to remove him. After someone interceded, he wrote a letter of repentance and was paid 70,000 yuan before leaving his position. Later, he asked his neighbor, surnamed Li, to request reinstatement, but it was unsuccessful. He then maliciously destroyed and promoted [his accusations] outside, even reporting them to the Zhabei Sub-bureau. Another witness, Mu Yunbo, from Tianjin, 38 years old, was then called. Reportedly, his relationship with Shu Yueqiao was very good.

He attempted to mediate on October 18th of last year. Shu asked to speak to him individually on the 19th, claiming that he had lost money trading gold on the side and wanted to "bump into" Li Ze. He then made three demands: (1) Give him

two gold bars to compensate for his losses; (2) Find him a job; (3) Supplement his salary if it was insufficient for living expenses. However, Shu Yueqiao said that on October 18th, he was in Ningbo, and the so-called conversation was fabricated. In fact, his accusation was because Li Ze had used despicable and shameless means to try to resolve the matter. On October 5th of last year, he even went to his home to discuss it, but he refused. Another accuser, Han Wucheng, claimed that Cai Ziwo was a close relative of Li Ze, and Mu Yunbo was formerly Li Ze's bodyguard. He had gambled away funds entrusted to him at the Six Nations Hotel but was not reprimanded by Li Ze. This time, he was repaying the favor, which was understandable, but their bias was not permitted by law. He then launched into a lengthy discourse, saying that those who betray national policy are traitors, like Qin Hui of the Southern Song Dynasty and Wu Sangui of the late Ming Dynasty, who were deranged and colluded with enemy states, which is not permitted by the people and the law. Li Ze is one of these people, so he is being accused according to law and should be punished to uphold loyalty and filial piety, so that the

national spirit of five thousand years will not perish. At this point, regarding Li Ze's participation in the first and second joint meetings of the "Commerce and Trade Control Association," there are meeting minutes as evidence. Li Ze testified, "I did not attend every time, I did not make any proposals, and I did not speak." He also claimed that the defendant has been working since the 7th year of the Republic for over 20 years and has never engaged in speculation or harmed the people. He has been detained for five months, and the losses are incalculable, so he asked for an early verdict. Chief Judge Liu then declared the opening of arguments. Prosecutor Dai Laoduo refuted the defendant's claim that he did nothing, saying that since he participated in the council and passed resolutions, it was working for the enemy and puppets, and the motive for accusing a traitor is irrelevant to the case. Subsequently, the defendant's lawyers, Chen Tingrui and Zhang Shizhao, defended the defendant, emphasizing that the determination of a traitor should be based on their actions. Li Ze only used the false position in the "Commerce and Trade Control Association" as a cover and was wholeheartedly working for the central government, so he cannot be judged as a traitor. After the arguments concluded, Gan Tian, a representative of the "Support Li Ze Traitor Accusation Association," came to the court to express his opinion, saying that Li Ze, as a director of the puppet Commerce and Trade Control Association, was a major economic traitor and should be severely punished.

### Senatorial Election Lawsuit: Two Cases Heard Yesterday

Plaintiff in the Fifth District Voluntarily Withdraws

(Report from this Newspaper) Two more senatorial election lawsuits were heard in the District Court yesterday morning: (1) City Councilor Cen Ziliang of the Fifth District was sued by Zhu Ying, a citizen of the district, because Cen's qualifications were questionable, and therefore, he requested confirmation of invalidity. During the hearing yesterday morning, Zhu Ying voluntarily withdrew the original lawsuit, so it was not heard. (2) Cao Shengzhi, Chief of General Affairs of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, sued for confirmation of the validity of his election as the third alternate senator. It had already been heard once. The litigation agent, lawyer Huang Renda, appeared in court. The defendant was represented by the legal representative, Xia Ming, Deputy District Chief of the district, and Li Xuexun, Chief of the Third Section of the Civil Affairs Department, who did not retain a lawyer. Xia claimed that the district received 36,000 ballots, issued 23,094 ballots, and the ballot box contained 22,650 ballots, with 452 invalid ballots, including 48 blank ballots. The pre-vote monitoring was absolutely fair and impartial. Li said: As long as the election

officials are legitimate, anyone can be elected. Witness Chen Hongsheng was then called. Chen served as a recorder for Cao in the voting area and knew that Cao received a total of 1,611 votes and 36 invalid ballots. Lawyer Huang claimed that the 15 invalid ballots examined in the previous hearing should not be regarded as invalid ballots, and the small number of blank ballots indicated that they had been switched out. The court adjourned for sentencing at 9:00 AM on June 8th.

### Mayor Schedules Reception for Cardinal Tian Tomorrow

### Trial of Traitors: Lu Xihou, Wang Xuenong, etc., All Ordered to be Rescheduled for Further Hearing

(Report from this Newspaper) The High Court heard several more cases of traitors yesterday: (1) Wang Xuezhu, from Shanghai, 50 years old, participated in enemy puppet work from June of the 27th year of the Republic and served as a supervisor and managing director and chief of the general affairs department of the puppet Huazhong Water and Electricity Company. After the victory, he was arrested by the Military Intelligence Bureau and prosecuted by the High Court Prosecutor's Office. Wang still argued, "My participation in the puppet organization was with the permission of the central government, and I have assisted underground workers and have contributed to the country." (2) Lu Xihou, from Shanghai, 53 years old, is the chairman and general manager of the puppet China Sports Company (Huili Ball Field). (3) Zhao Ziqian, from Guangdong, 39 years old, is a managing director; (4) Zhao Yuntai, from Guangdong, 56 years old, is a supervisor and chief of general affairs; (5) Huang Chuwei, from Guangdong, 47 years old, is the chief of accounting. The above four people were all prosecuted by the High Court Prosecutor's Office for gathering crowds to gamble during the enemy puppet era and using gambling taxes to supply the puppet municipal government with funds and exploiting good citizens. At the start of the trial, the four criminals all tried to quibble, saying that they did not harm the people. The cases of puppet Jiaxing County magistrate Jin Jianhong and Zhang Shaobo, two traitors, were also questioned once and ordered to be rescheduled for further hearing.

### Puppet Bureau Chief Qian Nengxia Sentenced to Twelve Years

(Report from this Newspaper) Qian Nengxia, the puppet Nanjing City Economic Bureau Chief, was sentenced yesterday.

### Rice Merchants Suspected of Being Involved in Grain Loan: Strict Investigation Underway; Rice Registration Deadline Today; Citizens Can Report Rice Shops That Raise Prices

(Report from this Newspaper) There have been various reports about grain merchants suspected of being arrested for misusing grain loans, but they are quite inconsistent. According to this newspaper's investigation, in addition to Wu Rongshang of Santai Rice Shop, who has already been detained, there are also Wang Xunzhi of Yangtze Company and two of the company's employees. In addition, the heads of various grain loan rice shops are summoned as needed. Therefore, unless substantial evidence of guilt is obtained, they will not be detained at any time. The detention of Le Yongming of Wuchang Rice Shop is due to suspicion of price gouging and is unrelated to the grain loan case.

Double inquiry: The Gongxin Accounting Firm, entrusted by the Grain Loan Audit Committee to investigate the grain loan accounts, has suspended its auditing work. It is reported that the principal of the firm, Xi Wangshu, was in Hangzhou when the firm was entrusted with the investigation. Now that Mr. Xi has returned to Shanghai, he feels that it is inappropriate to carry out the grain loan investigation, as he is also a member of the audit committee.

After the authorities vigorously cracked down on speculation in the local rice market, rice prices have indeed fallen in recent days. However, the rice market transactions are being monitored by relevant authorities, and rice merchants dare not test the law. However, the retail prices of various rice shops are not uniform. The authorities have paid attention to this, and if any rice shop's selling price exceeds the stipulated 6% profit margin, it will be dealt with severely. Citizens can also report at any time. Regarding the registration of rice stocks by rice merchants, the municipal government has set the deadline for today. Generally, rice merchants, realizing that the authorities will keep their word, rushed to the guild yesterday to complete the registration, and the response was enthusiastic. It is rumored that the municipal government will send personnel to secretly investigate according to the registered quantity. If it is found that there is concealed rice, in addition to confiscating all of their stored rice, they will also be severely punished according to law.

### Officer of the Garrison Command Bids Farewell to Li Ji and Lan; Li Declines Gold Horse

Officers above the rank of major from the headquarters of the Songhu Garrison Command and its affiliated units held a farewell gathering for Commander Li Ji and Lan at the New Life Clubhouse yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM. Attendees included Mr. Li, the new Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu, the commander of the 146th Division Dai Chuanxin, the commander of the 23rd Gendarmerie Regiment Wu Guangyun, the commander of the Protection Corps Cuan Youlue, and about 200 others. During the gathering, Mr. Li gave a speech encouraging his colleagues to continue their efforts. He also said that he had read in the newspaper that his colleagues were planning to make a gold horse as a souvenir, which he was deeply apprehensive about. Currently, prices are extremely high, and the monthly salary of colleagues is not enough to fill their stomachs. How can he bear to receive such a precious item and increase everyone's burden? He specially announced that he can only acknowledge this kind intention, but he will definitely decline to receive this item.

### Patrol Officer Accused of Embezzlement and Malpractice: Transferred to the High Court for Punishment

(Report from this Newspaper) Yang Qing, a Ningbo native who was formerly the captain of the puppet detective team in Caojiadu and an old acquaintance of the Hongqiao gambling table, continued to work as an undercover patrol officer in the Xujiahui Sub-bureau's investigation section after the victory. Now, due to investigating a tenant Zhu Jian's transfer fee of 1.8 million yuan, a death occurred. Recently, he was further accused of covering up drug trafficking, forcibly occupying civilian houses, embezzlement, and malpractice. In order to clarify officialdom, the district bureau issued an order to detain him and transferred him to the High Court yesterday for punishment according to law.

### Traitor Wen Zongyao Sold Public Property: Guangzhao Guild Files Lawsuit; Court Schedules Hearing Today

During the enemy puppet era, the traitor Wen Zongyao, relying on his power, seized the Guangzhao Guild, acting arbitrarily and treating public property as private property. He even sold the land of the old Guangzhao Villa owned by the Guangzhao Guild privately, totaling more than 130 acres. According to the Guangzhao Guild's charter, even if all the board members unanimously agreed, the property owned by the Guangzhao Guild absolutely cannot be sold. It is further heard that the reorganization committee of the guild filed a lawsuit with the District Court on May 21, requesting the court to confirm that Wen's theft and sale of land was invalid.

### Yu Youren Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing for General Inspection of Post-War Situation; Deeply Believes Peaceful Unification Can Be Achieved

Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, accompanied by Control Committee members Yan Zhuang and Lin Jing, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing by express train at 3:50 PM yesterday morning. Those who went to the North Station to welcome him included Central Committee member Pan Gongzhan, Jiangsu Supervisory District Inspector Cheng Zhonghang, and Xu Jianhou, Zhou Peizhen, Gu Yucang, and Yu's eldest daughter-in-law, Mrs. Yu Zhide. After Mr. Yu, leaning on a cane, got off the train, he shook hands with the welcoming personnel one by one and exchanged greetings. Mr. Yu was wearing a blue cloth long gown, with cloth socks and cloth shoes. His long beard fluttered in the wind, and he had a dignified appearance. Although he was tired from the journey, his spirit was still very strong. After Mr. Yu stepped out of the station, he took the same car with Committee Member Yan Zhuang and his eldest daughter-in-law and drove directly to the Jiangsu Supervisory District Inspector's Office on Bixun Road to rest. At 4:20 PM, he met with reporters at the Inspector's Office and made a statement: "I came to Shanghai to generally observe the post-war situation. Before the 2nd year of the Republic, I was running a newspaper in Shanghai. I have been in Shanghai for more than forty years, so Shanghai is my second hometown." Before the war, Mr. Yu's residence was at No. 11 Jing'an Villa. On the afternoon of February 13, 27th year, it was raided by the enemy and his collection of documents and classics was lost. This time returning to Shanghai (this was Mr. Yu's first return to Shanghai after the victory), he will add a little organization. As for the current general situation, Mr. Yu continued, "I did not participate in the negotiations, but based on my personal prediction, the central government is currently very determined to move forward, and peaceful unification will definitely be achieved in the future." It is heard that Mr. Yu will stay in Shanghai for about a week. Tonight, Inspector Cheng Zhonghang will host a banquet for him and invite Mayor Wu and heads of various agencies to accompany him. Tomorrow afternoon at 5:00 PM, Pan Gongzhan and Cheng Zhonghang will jointly host a tea party at the Eight Immortals Overseas Chinese Youth Association to welcome the press in this city.

### Most Employees of China National Aviation Corporation Airport Apply to Return to Work

Most of the original employees of the airport have now applied to the company to return to work. The company's authorities will carefully review and then make a decision. The organizers of the strike will be dismissed after investigation. The issue of improving treatment will not be decided for the time being.

### Report of Arrest of Principal Offender in Mystery Bank Robbery Case Unconfirmed

(Report from this Newspaper) Regarding the report that Chen Yuancheng, the principal offender in the Central Bank's major robbery case, has been arrested in Zhenhai, the Huangpu Sub-bureau, upon hearing the news, immediately telegraphed the Zhenhai Police Bureau to inquire whether Chen Yuancheng had been arrested and requested an immediate reply. They received a reply stating that "the robber has been arrested and handed over to the Commissioner's Office," but the Central Bank also received a reply from the Zhenhai Office stating that "Chen Yuancheng's mother and younger brother have been arrested." The police bureau, after referring to the contents of the two telegrams, deemed that there was insufficient definite proof, and yesterday evening again urgently telegraphed the Ningbo Sixth District Commissioner's Office for detailed information. The original telegram was as follows: "Chen Yuancheng, the principal offender in the Central Bank's robbery case, was previously reported to have been arrested by the Zhenhai Police Bureau. After inquiring by telegram, we received a reply that the offender has been taken away by your office. However, we would like to know whether it is Chen Yuancheng himself or his family members. Please reply." This reporter visited the Huangpu Sub-bureau again last night and asked Section Chief Zhou Guanghui. He stated that a second reply had not been received, but today (the 3rd), the Central Bank again received a telegram from the Zhenhai Office stating that it was Chen Yuancheng's cousin Chen Yuanjun who had been arrested. Therefore, whether the protagonist of the case, Chen Yuancheng himself, has been definitely arrested remains to be confirmed by a telegram reply within the next few days.

### Preventing Cholera: Relying on Yourself is Better than Relying on Others

(Report from this Newspaper) Since cholera was first discovered in the city on the 23rd of last month, it has occurred daily. The Municipal Health Bureau and various medical institutions have actively promoted prevention and control work and will conduct expanded publicity and widespread vaccinations.

After receiving the report, the city immediately implemented cholera quarantine work on ships traveling to and from Hong Kong and Guangdong. On April 26th, five people with true cholera were discovered among Japanese prisoners of war arriving from Hankou, which has led to its spread to this day. As of June 1st, a total of 54 patients have been discovered, with 8 deaths. According to the person in charge of the epidemic prevention office: Cholera may spread this year, so they are stepping up prevention and control work. At the same time, it is hoped that citizens will automatically cooperate and avoid unclean cold drinks and be vaccinated with preventive shots.

### Overseas Chinese Refugees in the U.S. Repatriated: Overseas Chinese Association Cables Consulate to Denounce

### The Only Way to Save Industry: Labor and Management Must Work Together. Zhu Xuefan Proposes Establishing Cooperative Factories; Enthusiastic Discussion at Various Union Symposia

[Report from this Newspaper] The Preparatory Committee of the Municipal General Labor Union held a symposium yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM in the main hall of the union's South City Penglai Road location, to discuss ways to save the national industrial crisis. Present were union leaders Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, Shui Xiangyun, and over two hundred representatives from various industry unions. Zhu Xuefan began by explaining the motivation for calling the meeting, stating: "Currently, the city's industry is facing a crisis. Workers, being the main sector of production, are closely related to this situation. After the victory, the workers hoped for construction, work, and food. However, existing industrialists feel it is difficult to maintain operations, while those who haven't started feel the future is bleak, and dare not try rashly. Employed workers cannot secure their livelihoods, while the unemployed demand work. It is the General Labor Union's duty to convene leaders from various unions to discuss and seek solutions." Zhu then reiterated Minister Gu and Mayor Wu's policies regarding the handling of labor-management disputes, and stated: "At this critical juncture, no worker wants factories to close down and cause unemployment; they only wish for factories to prosper and provide work. However, the current crisis, as mentioned by the person in charge of the silk industry association, is mainly due to: low exchange rates, the dominance of bureaucratic capital, high interest rates, inconvenient transportation, unstable domestic political situation, frequent labor strikes, etc. We workers, except for the responsibility for labor strikes, can do nothing about the other issues. At this time of severe industrial crisis, workers should frankly correct their own mistakes. Under Minister Gu's guidance, they should take responsibility, stop arbitrary strikes and work slowdowns, rectify discipline, increase production, and promote labor-management cooperation. Not only labor-management, but the government should also take responsibility, so that the government, labor, and management can cooperate to save this crisis. In today's world situation, there is no other way but cooperation and mutual benefit. Labor and management not only need to cooperate spiritually, but also need to move towards economic cooperation. Therefore, I propose establishing cooperative factories, to use cooperation to start idle machines and utilize wasted labor. Currently, suppressing prices and increasing production is one of the most important goals. Therefore, to solve the current industrial crisis, my opinion is that the government, labor, and management must cooperate."

Enthusiastic Discussions on Two Topics Following this, under the chairmanship of Zhou Xuexiang, the discussion began. The topics were: (1) the causes of the national industrial crisis, and (2) how to save the national industrial crisis, divided into promoting labor-management cooperation and saving national industry. Representatives from various unions spoke enthusiastically, pointing out that the main causes of the current crisis were political instability, the ongoing civil war, transportation blockages, and the inability to return to normal, which affected production efficiency. Other factors such as the dumping of foreign goods, the monopoly of bureaucratic capital, the backwardness of production tools and technology, the low intellectual level of labor, high loan interest rates, and improper factory management also contributed to the industrial crisis. At this time, Zhu Xuefan stood up and said: "I hope that all speakers will discuss the current industrial crisis from a purely fair standpoint and with an objective attitude. The labor side should also frankly accept criticism, admit past mistakes, correct them, and show the attitude that workers in the new China should have, so that labor and management can thoroughly cooperate." Yesterday, the enthusiasm of the union representatives and their correct understanding showed great improvement. Finally, Shui Xiangyun summarized everyone's opinions and made a conclusion:

Causes of the National Industrial Crisis (A) The causes of the national industrial crisis include the following: 1. Political instability, 2. Backward production tools, 3. Lack of raw materials, 4. Dumping of foreign goods, 5. Monopoly of bureaucratic capital, 6. Transportation obstruction, 7. Currency inflation, 8. Excessive price fluctuations, 9. Too many labor-management disputes, 10. Lack of funds, 11. Inadequate management talent, 12. High bank interest rates, 13. Lack of labor discipline among workers. (B) How to save the national industrial crisis: (1) Save the national industry with stable politics, (2) Strengthen agricultural production to increase raw material output, (3) Restore transportation, (4) Tighten the currency, (5) Regarding the issue of foreign goods dumping, A.

### Minister Gu Discusses Cooperation System to Solve Unemployment Problem

[Report from this Newspaper] Social Minister Gu Zhenggang gave many instructions to both industry, commerce, labor and management during his recent visit to Shanghai. On the second evening, Gu also broadcast a speech on the Cooperative Radio Station entitled "A Method to Solve the Current Unemployment Problem," advocating the establishment of a cooperative factory system. Gu stated that this new type of business structure was already indicated in the sixth plan of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's "The International Development of China".

Cooperative factories can limit the expansion of private capital and eliminate labor-management antagonism. Capital will not become increasingly concentrated, and those who contribute labor will also share the surplus they deserve. Laborers will not be exploited by capital, and the distribution problem will be solved simultaneously in the production process. Cooperative factories can realize the goal of capital socialization. The capital invested by members will only be given a statutory profit, and a certain percentage of the surplus must be stored as a public fund. This public reserve is jointly owned by the members and cannot be divided. In this way, all the funds of the cooperative factory can gradually be changed from private ownership to public use. Cooperative factories can improve the daily lives of workers because they have the establishment of consumer cooperatives, public welfare funds, and educational funds, so that the material and spiritual lives of workers can be reasonably improved. The process of cooperative factory operation is to adopt a labor-management cooperation system in the first stage, transform it into a labor-management integration system in the second stage, and finally workers will own their own factories. The payment of workers' wages can adopt a system of in-kind distribution, so that workers' lives can be effectively guaranteed and not affected by price fluctuations. The purchase of raw materials and the promotion of products can be entrusted to the Shanghai Branch of the National Cooperative Society Commodity Supply and Marketing Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs to handle it on their behalf. Its business operations can adopt either a single-operation system or a comprehensive operation system. The scale of organization should be able to accommodate at least one thousand or two thousand people per unit. Its operating procedures must start with raw materials that are relatively easy to purchase and products that are relatively easy to sell, in order to guarantee the development of the business. Today, the industrial construction of our country should be based on the cooperative system as an important foundation. In order to fundamentally solve labor disputes and to relieve unemployed workers, it is advocated to establish cooperative factories and to infiltrate the cooperative system into industry.

### Zongzi and Calamus Signify the Festival; Another Year Passes and It is Again the Dragon Boat Festival

Zongzi, calamus, loquat - it's the Dragon Boat Festival again. A few days ago, the advertisements in the newspaper showed that each zongzi cost 350 yuan. Today, I went to a famous shop on Nanjing Road to ask, but each one costs 500 yuan.

In other words, the price of one zongzi is almost equal to one liter of white rice!

Mayor Wu said that there is no shortage of rice in Shanghai. The reason rice is expensive is because of "ghosts." The Dragon Boat Festival is when Zhong Kui slays ghosts. It is time to "slay" these "ghosts" who hoard and speculate.

Festivals are not without a kind of embellishment to everyone's life. Whether it is drinking realgar wine, hanging calamus on the door, or bringing out the "atomic snake" when singing the Legend of the White Snake, however, in this world of turmoil and famine, wouldn't it be better to eat a few less zongzi and help the compatriots who are currently eating tree bark?

[Central News Agency, this city] The Shanghai University Professors Association stated that due to high prices, university professors are struggling to make a living, and that the proposed salary adjustment reported by the Executive Yuan does not even double the previous salary. They specifically requested the Executive Yuan to consider the facts and follow the recommendations of the Legislative Yuan in order to maintain education and reassure people. The original telegram reads: Premier Song and Deputy Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing, since the victory, prices have soared, and professors' lives have become increasingly difficult. Their salaries are meager, and they are suffering from hunger and cold, struggling to make ends meet. The situation is miserable. They have had to endure it extremely, only because they are engaged in cultural and educational undertakings. The Legislative Yuan previously proposed a plan to adjust the salaries of public and educational personnel, and after hearing about it, they felt somewhat comforted in their hunger and thirst, but the delay continues to this day, and even this minimum recommendation has not been passed.

### Wuhan University Professors Make Two Suggestions; Universities Should Not Be Established If Funding is Insufficient

[Report from this newspaper, Leshan, Sichuan] The National University Professors Association made two suggestions to the education authorities in Wuhan regarding the issue of professor salaries: (1) The establishment of a university must be worthy of the name. If funding is insufficient, it should not be established. If established, the funding and equipment must meet the standards required by a modern university. The government's approved educational budget and additional funding should be based on this principle, and the total amount of funding required by universities across the country each year, as well as the total amount of additional funding that should be added due to rising prices, should be statistically determined, and the designated funds should be deposited in the national treasury and distributed in installments. Each school's equipment and research expenses should account for at least 50% of the annual expenses and must not be used for other purposes. (2) Professor salaries should be as proposed by the Shanghai National College Professors' Association, with specific standards that are adjusted at any time. The adjustment method should be based on the cost of living index. Professor's income should be able to provide them with (1) support for their families, (2) education for their children, (3) purchase of necessary private books and research equipment.

### Zhejiang University Professors' Declaration Demands Secret Methods to Improve Treatment

[Report from this newspaper, Hangzhou] The National Zhejiang University Professors Association recently issued a declaration to demand improved treatment, stating briefly: (1) The nature of professors' work is special, and their treatment should be established according to different standards. (2) The calculation standards should be directly based on the cost of living index. (3) Increase research funding. Academic research funding should be included in the national annual budget. These demands are not limited to one corner, one place, one academy, or one school, but are universal demands across the country. The misery of the professors' living conditions is definitely not limited to one corner, one place, one academy, or one school, but is a universal phenomenon across the country. (Li)

The Kunyu basketball team played its fourth match in Shanghai last night. In an extremely tense situation, it lost to the champion Hualian team of this city by one point. The result was 48 to 46. In the first half, Hualian led by 28 to 24. The Kunyu team's performance has greatly improved, and the match was quite exciting, but the overall situation was controlled by Hualian. The performance of Li Zhenzhong and Wang Nanzhen was the best. Last night, the audience flocked to the venue, and the gymnasium was packed with people, estimated to be around 4,000. The "sold out" sign was hung up before the game started, and the scene was unprecedentedly grand.

Hualian started with Li Zhenzhong, Kong Guangyi, Bao Songyuan, Wu Chengzhang, and Bo Tuo. Kunyu started with Zhou Dayun, Cai Yanxiong, Tang Baokun, Wang Nanzhen, and Ren Xiangcheng. After contact, Wu Chengzhang opened the scoring with a free throw. Hualian's five tigers fought like gods, with tacit cooperation. Chengzhang, Zhenzhong, and Botuo were accurate in every shot, and instantly took a remote lead of 10 to 3. The visiting team called a timeout, secretly discussed a plan, and indeed Xiangcheng and Yanxiong both scored, but Hualian was still rampant, 23 to 9, which was Hualian's golden age. After that, the visiting team's momentum gradually increased, and the score approached. When Dayun scored, the first half ended, and Hualian led by 28 to 24 with two points ahead.

After the break, Hualian replaced Li Zhenzhong with Zhang Liangxiong. Nanzhen scored first, and Songyuan immediately responded. Xiangcheng and Yanxiong worked together and chased to a tie of 30 points each. The situation gradually became tense. When Dayun scored a wonderful shot, the visiting team took the lead for the first time, 30 to 30. The battle became a seesaw, and the scores rose and fell alternately, tying at 35, 37, and 39. Hualian's Zhenzhong reappeared, and Liangxiong withdrew. Zhenzhong scored twice, Guangyi scored from afar, 46 to 40, and Hualian took the lead again. Kunyu's Liang Yunming replaced Dayun, and Dayun re-entered, and it became a tie of 46 again. After Guangyi scored, the time ended, and Hualian forcibly took the visiting team with a difference of two points, 48 to 46.

### Replies to Readers - Legal Inquiries

(1) Sun Zhenyuan asks Editor: My father passed away early, and my mother is illiterate. I am young and working for a living in Suzhou, unfamiliar with social conditions. Therefore, I respectfully inquire: Before the War of Resistance, we originally resided in the Nanshi area of Shanghai. During the "August 13th" Incident, we fled to the former French Concession. The following year, the situation in Nanshi improved, and refugees returned in droves. However, the landlord said, "It has already been occupied and registered by someone." My mother protested and checked the old residence, finding it indeed occupied and our furniture and belongings being used. After inquiring from various sources, we learned that this person was a henchman of enemy spies. We had no choice but to endure in silence. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, with the return of peace, the people should be able to live and work in peace. However, the occupier remains. Therefore, I specifically inquire: (1) How can we prevent them from reselling the furniture? (2) How can we make them move out and compensate for the furniture that has already been stolen and sold? Please provide a detailed reply.

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia Answers] (1) The owner of the furniture should present concrete evidence or proof of ownership to reclaim their property or prevent others from disposing of it without permission. If preventing this is ineffective, they can request the court to eliminate the infringement. (2) (A) If you have a legitimate lease right to the house, you can demand that the person forcibly occupying it vacate or request the court to order them to move out. If the lease relationship has been interrupted, you should first contact the lessor to restore it. (B) The person who stole and sold the furniture is liable for compensation. The victim should collect evidence of the theft and negotiate with the thief. If this is ineffective, they can bring a lawsuit in court.

(2) Zhang Yurong asks Editor: I have several questions. Please have your legal advisor provide guidance: (1) On what legal basis does the government protect second-hand landlords from arbitrarily increasing rent? (2) The second-hand landlord of this house changed from Huang to Miao. In the winter of 1943, they privately transferred the lease. Is this legally binding? (3) After the government’s restoration, did the Shanghai Municipal Government announce regulations abolishing the qualifications of second-hand landlords and increasing rent, or was this only applicable between primary landlords and second-hand landlords?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia Answers] (1) The government does not have any laws protecting second-hand landlords from arbitrarily increasing rent. (2) A second-hand landlord's private transfer of a leased house is not legally binding. If the transfer was not approved by the primary landlord, the primary landlord can terminate the lease based on this. (3) (A) Upon investigation, this city has no laws abolishing the qualifications of second-hand landlords. (B) The standard for collecting rent in this city applies to the general relationship between lessors and lessees.

(3) A reader from Jiangwan asks: I have been running a small business in Jiangwan Town. At the beginning of the occupation, the local tycoons all became "new nobles" and established "cooperatives," forcing donations from every household, claiming that members could enjoy fair prices. Although we saw daily necessities such as soap, candles, and matches being transported in, we never managed to buy any. After the victory, the "new nobles" became new figures again. When I casually inquired about the past, they claimed that all the cooperative members were collaborators and had no right to speak. However, the president and directors embezzled the goods, sold them on the black market, and made a fortune, while no one dared to ask questions, and they even scolded people for being collaborators. I am truly resentful. I don't know whether being forced to join a puppet cooperative as a member and never receiving any enemy or puppet goods makes me a collaborator and traitor. Do I have any crime or right to speak? Seeking your guidance.

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia Answers] Being forced to join a puppet cooperative as a member and never receiving any enemy or puppet goods cannot be considered collaboration and treason, nor does it constitute a criminal charge. Cooperative members legally have the right to speak on cooperative affairs.

### Supplementary Answer to Legal Inquiries - Letter from Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin

To the Editor: Regarding the various "Legal Inquiries" questions answered by this lawyer on May 27th, the answer concerning Mr. Xu Gongmao's question was misplaced due to the numerous questions. The corrected answer is as follows: "When voluntarily recovering the repayment in the future and retrieving the IOU, according to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Restoration promulgated on December 18, 1945, if, due to reasons not attributable to the party, circumstances change unexpectedly and fairness is manifestly lost based on the original effect, the court should fairly consider increasing or decreasing the payment." I hope this will be published immediately to resolve the inquirer's doubts and avoid misunderstandings. Respectfully, Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin of the Shen Bao Social Services Department, May 28th.

### "Resumption of Operations" and "Repayment of Principal" Rumors Abound - Government Bonds Soar and Plummet - Unusually Tight Funds and Unfavorable Environment - Neither Chinese nor Foreign Stocks Show Improvement

Yesterday, the black market for government bonds initially saw Tong Bing bonds rise from 6700 yuan to over 7000 yuan due to news of the resumption of stock exchange operations. However, soon afterward, due to rumors of using customs gold for government bond repayment, many rushed to sell, and the situation eased. Around noon, it fell to 5500 yuan before stabilizing slightly. As a result, it closed 900 yuan lower than last Saturday. After closing, there were rumors of it falling to 5400 yuan and then rising to 5900 yuan. Chinese stocks followed the same downward trend as government bonds. At the opening, they rose slightly due to the optimism surrounding the resumption of trading. Yong Yarn rose to 6070 yuan, Meiya to 4550 yuan, Jingfu to 310 yuan, Xinguang to 300 yuan, and Qinxing to 238 yuan. Later, the banks experienced unusually tight funds. A large amount of sealed materials was distributed during the day, further tightening credit. Many were discouraged, and prices gradually declined in the afternoon, closing at lower prices. The declines in Yong Yarn, Meiya, and Qinxing were slight compared to last Saturday, while Xinguang and Jingfu each fell by half a percent. Less popular small and medium-sized stocks declined again. Afternoon bidding prices were slightly higher. Foreign stocks were stable at the opening, with Ewo Yarn hovering around 12400 yuan. However, news of the resumption of operations could not withstand the unfavorable real environment. Demand became slightly erratic, and different stocks reacted differently. The popular Ewo Yarn retreated slightly to around last Saturday's closing price. By the afternoon, the rise and fall of various stocks varied compared to last Saturday.

### Selling Occurs at Every High Point - Rayon Prices Decline Gradually

Yesterday, the spot price for 120-day bridge rayon was 1.345 million yuan in the morning and 1.33 million yuan in the afternoon, a decrease of 45,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. Rayon has been weak for several days because large amounts are sold off whenever the price is good, causing the market price to weaken gradually. Factory transactions were quiet, but prices remained firm. Yesterday, 74/75 evenness was traded by foreign firms at a price of 2.1 million yuan. Dry-spun Hangzhou prices were lower, and the Shanghai market also decreased by 45,000 yuan yesterday. Mesh goods from Meiya and bedding were 10,000 yuan higher than on Saturday.

### Tight Credit Around the Festival - Yarn, Cotton, and Cloth Transactions are Scarce

Yesterday, yarn market prices were weak and transactions were scarce. Because of the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival today, buyers were hesitant. Those under pressure from tight credit had no choice but to lower prices to sell. Thus, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn fell by 70-80,000 yuan, while 20-count Double Horse and small and medium-sized yarns fell by 10-20,000 yuan each. Only the Nanjing gang showed some interest in buying. Sentiment was extremely flat. At noon, Fangjian opened yarn as usual, with prices marked down 20-30,000 yuan compared to the previous session. However, 80-count single Bull Head thread saw a huge price drop of 100,000 yuan from the price opened last Friday.

Yesterday, New York's American cotton telegrams continued to rise by 6 to 12 points. Near-term American dollars were priced at 28.17, far-term at 28.69, and current Mitchell at 28.77. The local Shanghai cotton market situation was firm. However, due to the approaching Dragon Boat Festival, manufacturers were somewhat hesitant, resulting in poor transactions. High-grade Mitchell delivered to factories traded at 106,000 yuan, an increase of about 10-20,000 yuan.

Due to the Dragon Boat Festival, cloth market purchases were not as strong as the previous day, so fewer buyers were present. Gray cloth prices fell by 500 yuan. However, Shirting cloth remained stable due to the season. Provinces such as Sichuan, Jiangxi, Shanxi, Fujian, Hunan, and Tianjin continued to purchase winter goods.

### Luxury Goods - Foreign Exchange Settlement Not Allowed

The Central Bank has noted that in recent months, imports have been increasing, especially luxury goods, which not only affect the development of our country's industry but also cause capital outflow. Therefore, it has ordered all Chinese and foreign foreign exchange banks and money shops to stop settling foreign exchange for luxury goods. The Ministry of Finance has also issued an order to customs to absolutely prohibit the import of luxury goods.

### Yang Jinsheng to Visit Japan Again - To Discuss Barter Trade with MacArthur - Sino-Korean Trade Agreement to be Signed Soon

Post-war Japan needs our country to supply a great deal of materials. The Executive Yuan sent Yang Jinsheng, Deputy Manager of the Barter Trade Department of the Central Trust Bureau, as a special commercial commissioner to Tokyo to discuss matters with General MacArthur's headquarters and to prepare for commercial activities in Japan. The results were excellent. After Yang returned to China, he shipped salt and wheat bran to Japan and used the proceeds to purchase mulberry seedlings, silkworm eggs, sleepers, coal mining equipment, and machine parts, totaling more than 60,000 tons. However, due to the unstable situation in the Northeast, goods such as soybeans needed by Japan could not be shipped out, and salt from Huai Lu in North China could not be transported due to the situation. Japan is now requesting to purchase 800,000 tons of salt from us, but due to labor, fuel, and transportation costs, we currently plan to supply only 300,000 tons. Special Commissioner Yang is scheduled to visit Japan again at the end of this month to inspect the situation and discuss various barter trade matters with Mr. Yan Enwei, Director of the Economic Affairs Section of our country's delegation to Japan, at General MacArthur's headquarters. However, our country does not currently have many goods to export to Japan. It is reported that the goods shipped back from Japan will be fresh and dry cocoons, cotton textiles, and industrial equipment to meet domestic needs.

In other news, China and South Korea are working hard to develop trade. Regarding trade between China and South Korea, a trade agreement will be established. Mr. Shao Yulin, Head of our military delegation to South Korea, is currently negotiating with the Korean government. Mr. Shao will be responsible for signing the Sino-Korean trade agreement.

### Rice Market Sees More Arrivals Than Sales - Prices Continue to Fall by 1,000 to 2,000 Yuan

The rice market remained sluggish today, with prices continuing to decline by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. White rice saw better sales due to the Dragon Boat Festival, forming a stable pattern. Yellow beans were flat and weak, while corn saw no activity from buyers, falling by over 1,000 yuan.

### Rice Shops Request Increased Profits - Implementation Postponed After Consideration

The retail rice shops belonging to the Shanghai Rice Industry Association originally stipulated a profit of 6% per shi when selling rice. However, recently, due to rising prices and high expenses, members requested an increase in profits to 8%. This was approved by the members' meeting and was about to be implemented. However, after careful consideration by the association, it was decided to postpone implementation.

### Fine Mei Tea Prices Rise

The Tianjin gang will collect green flower tea.

Fine Mei and Needle Mei teas, which are exclusively sold to Africa and Morocco, are currently being negotiated by Jardine Matheson with the suppliers. However, both sides are very firm in their stance, so not many agreements have been reached. However, the market sentiment is excellent. The price of Fine Mei has risen compared to last week, while Needle Mei remains firm. As for various domestic sales teas, although the local shops and buyers from other regions are interested, they are not interested in buying or selling during the Dragon Boat Festival. Therefore, transactions are limited. According to news from the Tianjin gang, they plan to accept all green flower tea without rejection after the festival.

### Grain and Goods Loan Program Concludes

According to news from the Four Banks Joint Office, the grain merchant loan program launched by the office in April has been terminated early due to poor performance.

### Bituminous Coal Shows Slight Increase - Anthracite Coal Still Shows No Improvement

The coal market saw the previous trends continue for anthracite coal. Actual sales are difficult to improve for the time being, and prices are hovering around a weak level. Bituminous coal dust is being actively purchased by factories, resulting in a shortage of actual goods and a continued rise in market prices. Bituminous coal chunks are following suit, with asking prices rising rapidly. Fortunately, actual sales are limited, and the increase is still slight. Charcoal is slightly weak due to the upcoming festival, but retail sales are still unwilling to lower prices.

### China Silk Corporation Raises Cocoon Prices - Top Grade at 180,000 Yuan - Medium Grade at 130,000

The China Silk Corporation has set up cocoon collection points in Wuxi, Changzhou, Jiaxing, Wujiang, and other places, setting price standards based on the quality of the cocoons. It is reported that the purchasing price for the best quality cocoons has been raised to 180,000 yuan per dan, while the medium grade is also around 130,000 yuan.

In order to actively improve the quality of raw silk, the Jiangsu Silk Improvement Zone has established a method for handling cocoons and has notified farmers to adopt the following three measures:

(1) Do not use sunlight to dry cocoons to avoid degrading the quality of good cocoons. (2) Do not use good cocoons to reel native silk to avoid lowering the selling price and reducing income. Use new silk reeling machines to produce good raw silk. (3) Do not retain native breeds to avoid affecting cocoons and raw silk.

### American Cotton Arrives in Succession - Local Cotton Greatly Affected

Recently, a cotton yarn magnate stated that after the war, a large amount of American cotton has been imported. The selling price is not higher than that of domestic cotton, and the quality is better. Therefore, most manufacturers prefer to buy American cotton, greatly affecting the sales of domestic cotton. As for the cotton-producing areas in North China and Northwest China, transportation difficulties and high freight costs make the cost of shipping cotton to Shanghai higher than that of American cotton. Therefore, very little cotton is shipped to Shanghai from the above-mentioned areas. Moreover, the provinces of North China and Northwest China have been plagued by banditry for years, and production has also sharply decreased. It is hoped that the government will take effective relief measures to avoid the collapse of Chinese cotton.

### Ministry of Communications Formulates Loan Standards to Aid Commercially Owned Damaged Ships

During the war, commercially owned ships suffered damage, directly or indirectly, due to the war.

A total of 286 steamships, 118 sailboats, and 15 pontoons are awaiting repair. The total amount of loans requested is approximately 2 billion yuan. The relief method is to provide low-interest loans from national banks. Regarding the standards for loans, it is learned that the Ministry of Communications has formulated the following measures:

(1) The standards for approving loans for ships are: 1) over 102 tons, 2) under 20 years old, 3) registered with the maritime administration, 4) repair costs not exceeding 70% of the ship's construction cost. (2) Supervision and auditing of loans for ship repairs will be handled by the local maritime administration or by the local government entrusted by the Ministry of Communications.

(3) The loan source will be requested by the Ministry of Finance from the Executive Yuan for allocation by the Four Banks Joint Office.

### Higher Prices in Other Cities, Buying by Out-of-Town Buyers - Gold Market Turns from Weak to Firm - US Dollars Decline Slightly

Gold remained difficult to support yesterday. Due to the Dragon Boat Festival, various industries urgently needed to settle debts, resulting in oversupply. The opening price was 1.8 million yuan, but it was soon suppressed by multiple liquidations. At the same time, buyers were hesitant due to distribution price issues, falling below 1.78 million yuan. The Central Bank distributed 57 bars at a price of 1.775 million yuan. There was little change afterward, and it fell again to 1.76 million yuan at noon. The afternoon started flat, but as the next-day settlement opened, it rose slightly to around 1.79 million yuan. However, the market price changed again after 4 PM because gold prices rebounded in other cities. Buyers from Suzhou and Wuxi bought, and finally broke through the 1.8 million yuan mark, resulting in an increase of about 20,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. Ornament gold rose from 188,000 yuan to 192,000 yuan. Silver bullion was flat, while silver dollars fell slightly. The underground money market tightened due to external influences, and interest rates rose from 15% to 20%.

Foreign currency, US dollars, was mediocre. The process was slightly more stable than the gold market. It fell slightly from 2,340 yuan at the beginning of the morning to 2,320 yuan. It continued to struggle at this price at noon and in the afternoon. The result was a slight decrease of 5 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong notes were boosted by telegraphic transfers, rising 5 yuan. Hong Kong exchange rates were affected by the shrinkage of Hong Kong port telegrams, with sellers offering 435 yuan. Rupees also rose to 528 yuan before being sold, but transactions were not numerous. The US exchange rate remained unchanged.

### Overdue Goods in Customs Warehouse - Extension Granted Until the End of August

### Copper Scarcity: Europe and America are Both Facing Shortages; US Price Controls May Be Raised

[Reuters, London, 3rd] Although the United States has purchased 30,000 tons of copper from Chile in the first half of this year, the copper shortage has not eased. In the first quarter of this year, the United Kingdom imported 38,700 tons from Rhodesia, Canada, and the Belgian Congo, while exporting only 10,200 tons. The remaining 28,500 tons are reserved for consumption this quarter. Estimated demand for this year is around 74,700 tons. At the end of 1945, the government originally intended to store 123,000 tons, but compared to last year's reserves of 300,000 tons, the difference is significant. By the end of March last year, reserves had already decreased to below 80,000 tons. The United Kingdom has already suspended copper exports since February. The quantity in March was only 72 tons. Given the current consumption rate, even with the 30,000 tons from Chile and other imports, it is still difficult to maintain the current deficit level. The purchasing contract with Chile was originally signed in the past, with a price significantly lower than the current £72 per ton. Therefore, the upward trend in world copper prices is causing anxiety for the British government. It is reported that French New Records has purchased a batch from the United States at a price of £82 per ton, which is approximately equal to the £78 paid for Chilean copper that has already been delivered. The US price control may be raised from 12.25 cents per pound to 14 cents (equivalent to £78 per ton). Before the government reaches a satisfactory agreement with various imperial producers, the price of copper in the UK should not be raised immediately. Given the current intense competition from aluminum and the general belief that the copper shortage will not last long, the current upward trend in copper prices will soon become clear. Imperial producers should prioritize securing long-term guarantees in the British market and should not haggle over pennies during this abnormal temporary shortage.

### Refined Granulated Sugar Prices Decline

Yesterday, the sugar market saw a decline in prices as the Dragon Boat Festival approached, resulting in weaker demand. Additionally, company stocks were being released. The spot market saw an increase in inventory, leading to a price correction. The Sugar Association set the benchmark price for refined granulated sugar at 71,500 to 71,000 yuan, a decrease of 2,000 yuan. Company warehouse receipts were priced at 69,000 to 69,500 yuan, down by 1,000 yuan. Dealer prices for Dianhua white sugar opened at 74,000 yuan, then decreased to 72,000 to 68,000 yuan. Xinghua red sugar was priced at 61,500 yuan, then decreased to 61,000 to 60,000 yuan.

### Government Approves Free Purchase of Copper, Tin, Lead, Aluminum, and Other Minerals

The Resource Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has received a notification from the Executive Yuan, stating that from the 11th of this month, merchants and civilians across the country can freely purchase and transport tin, copper, lead, aluminum, nickel, zinc, gypsum, mica, asbestos, and other minerals. Furthermore, from this date, no export permits are required for the transportation and export of these minerals.

### Status of Clearing House Affiliation Undecided

The establishment of the Joint Reserve Committee of the Banking Industry in this city is imminent. Whether the Clearing House will be independent in the future or affiliated with the aforementioned institution is a matter of concern for many. It is understood that before the War of Resistance, the Shanghai Clearing House was managed by the Joint Reserve Committee of the Banking Industry. After the victory, the Financial Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance instructed both the banking and money industries to jointly manage it under the supervision of the Central Bank. The future organization and any changes will be determined after the official establishment of the Joint Reserve Committee.

### Indian Cotton Export Permits Expire at the End of July

[Reuters, Bombay, 3rd] The Bombay Export Control Office published a notice in the newspapers stating that export permits for raw cotton, whether already issued or pending issuance, will be valid until July 31, 1946.

### New Wheat Arrives in Shanghai

According to grain industry sources, new wheat from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces has been entering the market successively for a month. Grain merchants have already transported some to this city, and the purchase price is quite low, greatly benefiting the city's food supply.

### Xing Fourth Yuan Slightly Loosens

The price of Xinghua Osmanthus cakes has loosened slightly due to continuous sales in recent days. Xing Fourth Yuan opened at 192,000 yuan, while Big Bubble Yuan remained at 100,000 yuan.

### British Observer Urges Textile Industry to Innovate Equipment

[Reuters, Manchester, 3rd] Mr. Windle Barton, a former British observer attached to the US textile delegation to Japan, told a Reuters correspondent yesterday that the Dutch textile industry, in order to restore its past prosperity, must renovate its equipment and adopt a two-shift system. The cost should not be considered a problem. The United States is working hard to develop in this way. If the United States can do it, why can't the United Kingdom? In terms of cotton and rayon, we should also regard Japan as a competitor.

### Actual Sales of Woolen Fabrics Decrease

The actual sales of woolen fabrics have decreased recently. As a result, the standard market prices at the Public Tea House have trended towards stagnation. Inspections of tailors selling ready-made Chinese garments on Qipan Street and Western-style tailors on Nanjing Road, Sichuan Road, Lin Road, and Hubei Road all reveal exceptionally slow business. The fifth and sixth months of the lunar calendar have always been a phenomenon in previous years, and the high cost of labor is also a factor. Before the war, the fabric for a Western suit cost 12 yuan in legal tender, and the labor cost 8 yuan. Now, labor costs are higher than the fabric. The fabric only costs 120,000 yuan, while the labor costs 150,000 to 200,000 yuan.

### Bank and Money Shop Deposits Reach Over 79 Billion in Five Months

The business of banks and money shops in this city has been normal for the past five months, and the situation is very stable. As of the end of last month, the total amount of deposits in all banks and shops in the city reached over 79 billion yuan in national currency. The deposit reserve funds deposited by each bank and shop in the Central Bank totaled approximately 18 billion yuan.

### Bank of China Increases Deposit Interest Rates; Both Fixed and Current Accounts Increase

In order to expand its business and encourage depositors to actively deposit, the Bank of China has decided to increase interest rates on fixed deposits and special current deposits by 25% and 40% respectively at the time of this settlement of interest (June 20) to show special consideration.

### Dried Lily Buds Becoming Scarce

Due to the gradual depletion of inventory and limited supply in the market, the market price of dried lily buds continues to rise. Yesterday, the top-grade goods in the market rose by another 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, reaching a price of 200,000 yuan.

### Market Summary

Cotton Fabrics: Sweatshirts and socks with counts of 80 or higher are scarce due to a shortage of raw materials. The China Textile Company has also not released any stocks, and existing inventory is dwindling day by day, so prices are trending towards firmness. Due to the hot weather, "Smarto" shirts are selling slowly, and Hong Kong shirts have regained popularity. Although factory prices have not fallen, the market price is 155,000 yuan.

Western Medicine: The upward trend continues. Solacin tablets have slightly decreased in price due to factory shipments. Ampoules of Anteler and Dolantin are being hoarded, and prices have been driven up again.

Daily Necessities: Wuku brand laundry soap has larger distribution volume from the factory, while Arrow, Huang Xiangmao and other soaps are under pressure. Phoenix Ningbo matches and candles are still selling well, and prices are firm.

Cigarettes: Old Knife, Pins, and other brands from British American Tobacco are being purchased vigorously by buyers from Beijing and Hankou, and prices are brisk. The prices of Chinese-made cigarettes are mixed.

Leather: Raw yellow cattle hides and yellow-faced leather are both declining. However, American MST yellow-grain leather remains firm due to shortages. The rest is mediocre, and transactions are sparse.

Dyes: Black electric powder (2.07 million) was transacted, and Samsung grey and Daqiao Zhu continued to be popular, and the market is trending firmer.

Hardware: Market conditions are mixed, with ups and downs. The Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, and the market is quite slow.

Chemical Raw Materials: Caustic soda continues to rise, and soda ash and soda also follow suit. Bleaching powder has rebounded slightly. Vaseline and white oil are relatively stable.

Bristles: The market remains sluggish, with few inquiries, and it is difficult for prices to improve.

### Pig Bristles Mostly Shipped to the United States; Export Volume in March and April

The person in charge of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau stated that the export volume of pig bristles concentrated in the Shanghai market that had been inspected and certified by the bureau in March and April was 5,399 dan in March and 4,489 dan in April. Among them, the quantity shipped to New York City in the United States was the largest, and the quantity shipped to London was very small. The pig bristles gathered in Shanghai mainly came from Chongqing and Wuhan. There was also a small amount of production from the local area and the suburbs. The packaging method was all wooden boxes, which were rectangular, 26 1/4 inches long, 20 inches wide, and 12-14 inches high. The inside of the box was lined with oil paper, and each bundle of pig bristles was wrapped in clean white paper, with the factory's trademark and measurement noted. When packing, camphor powder was applied between each bundle of pig bristles to prevent insects. Each box weighed about 120 catties, and the number of pig bristles in each box varied depending on the length, ranging from 200 to 400 bundles.

### Haimen is Advancing

— Haimen Communication, May 28th, by Jifeng

Haimen County, separated from Shanghai by the Yangtze River and adjacent to Nantong in Jiangbei, is not the well-known Zhejiang commercial port of Haimen. Before introducing the situation of a county, the reporter must first introduce the person in charge of the county. County Magistrate Liu Daoping is a burly man, not yet forty years old. It is said that during the War of Resistance, he was a secretary under General Tang Enbo. He possesses the qualities that a county magistrate should have: shrewdness, strength, integrity, and democracy.

A Delaying Tactic Scares Away the Communist Army

At the end of April, the Communist army launched an "offensive" in northern Jiangsu. During the crisis in Haimen County, County Magistrate Liu did not leave the county government and used a clever plan to resolve the siege, which was widely praised. When the Communist army approached the county seat, the National army was few in number and difficult to resist. Reinforcements were slow to arrive. The county magistrate, in his quick thinking, secretly ordered residents overnight to go to a designated location at dawn the next day to welcome the main force of the three regiments of the National army, which had landed at Qinglong Port to reinforce the county. The matter was learned by Communist army spies, and the approaching troops quietly retreated. A day later, reinforcements arrived, and the county seat was safe.

County Magistrate Liu also attaches great importance to education. Considering the decline of teachers and the unevenness of their qualifications after the war, he first focused on the selection of primary school teachers. He is harmonious and sincere towards his subordinates, and he never allows any delay in governing the county. He personally reviews the county government's economic revenue and expenditure every day, which are absolutely transparent.

One County, Two Worlds

Speaking of the public security of Haimen County, it is truly sigh-worthy. After so long since the victory, only four towns and strongholds in Haimen County have been taken over by the National army: Haimen County, Tianbu Town, Qinglong Port, and San Chang Town. There, everything is heading towards the path of recovery, people's lives are guaranteed, and actions are free. The government's decree to ban opium has also been vigorously promoted by the police station using the Baojia system, with registration, investigation, summons, and detoxification... all handled with the utmost effort. In contrast, in the areas controlled by the Communist army, most of the local bullies, ruffians, and idlers have become "militiamen," holding a "fork" (a type of weapon) in their hands, pretending to be "heroes." A "guerrilla group" with a pistol and a few grenades is like a living Yama. Murder and robbery are specially permitted by their "superiors." People who are killed are always regarded as "National spies" or "stubborn elements." Robbing people's money is rightfully considered "communization." The former village chiefs have all been scared away and have fled to Nantong, Zhenjiang, Shanghai, and other places. As a result, cattle herders became village chiefs, and illiterate peasants became township heads. There are small meetings every three days and large meetings every five days, "gathering them by beating drums and summoning them by striking wood." The rich have indeed been "communized." Even the real farmers who cannot live without working for a day are also disturbed and cannot rest.

The Cultural World is Heading Towards Revival

There is one county-run middle school, one privately-run middle school, and one church-run (Catholic Church) middle school in the county. The private Haimen Middle School, formerly known as Pudong Middle School, once enjoyed a reputation in the education world. Although the school building was destroyed in the bombing, it is now being presided over by the original principal, Mr. Cai Yinen, and classes have resumed in the Zhongshan Hall in the county seat. The above schools are concentrated in the county seat because there are more houses and guarantees there. Most of the teachers are wealthy scholars and veterans who have served in the education field for a long time. Each town and village has one or two primary schools, with mostly complete primary schools in the towns and mostly elementary primary schools in the villages. This spring, the county government ordered all primary schools in the county to be renamed National Schools to earnestly implement national education. However, the primary schools are scattered in various places, most of which are still in areas controlled by the Communist army. What kind of effect the county government's hard work can achieve is unpredictable.

After the victory, the Haimen newspapers included the newly established New Haimen Daily and the re-established Jianghai Daily. The county regards these two newspapers as the mouthpiece of the people. Unfortunately, both newspapers are too small in size, and the printing is outsourced to a printing shop, so there are often missing lead characters. In this environment of unequal supply and demand and inadequate equipment, the appearance of these two newspapers can be considered satisfactory.

The county has one public library, which is adjacent to the county government. Unfortunately, many books have been lost in the chaos of war, and very few remain.

Industry is Primarily Based on Cotton Yarn and Cloth

There were originally two factories in industrial production: one was the Dasheng Third Textile Company, also known as Dasheng Third Factory, in Sanchang Town, which produced yarn and cloth with trademarks such as "Kui Xing," which sold well throughout the country and enjoyed an excellent reputation. The other was the Yisheng Brewing Winery in Changle Town, the hometown of Zhang Jian, which produced strong liquors with trademarks such as "Ship" and "Globe," which were famous at home and abroad in the early years. In 1906, it even won a special award in Italy. Both factories were founded by Zhang Jian and suffered significant losses during the War of Resistance. Dasheng Third Factory was forcibly occupied by the Japanese for several years. Although it was later returned, many important mechanical parts were looted, and work could not proceed for a time, resulting in a standstill. Although it has now resumed production, all the machines cannot be fully operated. The losses of the Yisheng Factory were even more tragic. The brewing equipment has been lost without a trace, and the factory buildings have been repeatedly damaged by the enemy and puppets, with walls collapsing and birds and animals nesting inside, which is a heartbreaking sight. Opening the factory is even more remote. Therefore, at present, the county's industrial production only consists of the yarn and cloth of Dasheng Third Factory.

Wheat Enters the Market; Soybeans and Sorghum are Harmed by Insects

Haimen has mostly high ground, which is not suitable for growing rice. The main crops are wheat, soybeans, sorghum, and cotton. Residents mostly rely on farming for a living, and they follow old rules for cultivation and fertilization. Fertilizers are mainly human waste and soybean cakes. They refuse to use chemical fertilizers, believing that while the harvest can be increased in the year of application, the land will become infertile as a result.

The main food crop of the residents, wheat, has now entered the market, with a market price of 17,000 to 18,000 yuan per dan. The price of new wheat dried and discounted by 70% or 80% is actually more than 20,000 yuan per dan. The auxiliary food crop is corn sorghum. This year, seedlings of both sorghum and soybeans are harmed by insects, and farmers are helpless and extremely anxious. If the sorghum seedlings are like this, there is no hope for a harvest, and the future of food is worrying.

No Silk is Raised; Mulberry Trees are Cut for Firewood

Raising silkworms was originally a side business for the villagers, but now, because China's silk industry has been in decline, and because fuel is extremely expensive (fuel in Haimen – grass firewood – is in greater demand than supply. Before the war, one dan of rice could be exchanged for 2,000 catties of firewood; after the war, one dan of rice can only be exchanged for 600 catties of firewood), cutting mulberry trees for firewood has resulted in a lack of households raising silkworms. During the slack farming season, 90% of villagers spin yarn and weave cloth to supplement their livelihoods, making it a side business. The cloth woven by the villagers is sold as far south as Shanghai and as far north as various ports in northern Jiangsu. Homespun cloth is valued by the catty, and it is said that the current market price is about 220,000 yuan per 100 catties.

### Answering a Mysterious Riddle: Hitler Trapped Himself; The Assassination Attempt Was Hitler's Fatal Wound; Special Translation by the Newspaper's Translation Office

The question of Hitler's life and death seems to be a mysterious riddle. According to a UPI dispatch from Berlin on the 22nd, Hitler and his mistress Eva Braun did not commit suicide and are still alive. However, according to the article "The Mental Analysis of Hitler" published in the American magazine "Collier's" on May 4, Hitler's absence from the world has become a foregone conclusion. The following is an abridged translation of the article for speculation. The original author of this article, Major Cortez F. Enloe, Jr., is the director of the Medical Group of the US Bombing Strategy Research Institute and has been engaged in researching the impact of bombing on the health of the German people. Co-author Dr. Hans Reese is a professor of neurology at the University of Wisconsin and also an expert at the aforementioned research institute. The two researchers studied captured documents related to Hitler's health and personally questioned Hitler's personal physician, Dr. Giesing. They have detailed analysis and new medical insights into Hitler's health, neurotic anxieties, excessive suspicion, and the degradation of Hitler's mind in his last year.

### Hitler's Personal Physician Obtains Mental Conclusions

Within this week a year ago, Hitler mysteriously and strangely ended his life, the inevitable fate to which he was destined. That is the conclusion drawn from the notes of Hitler's personal doctors, who once recognized the inner layer of Hitler's body and mind, and witnessed Hitler's self-destruction at the last moment.

The words of doctors know no boundaries. Perhaps because we are doctors, we have been able to obtain sufficient information to prove the physiological and psychological state of Hitler in his last years. When we asked Hitler's personal doctors, they casually and eloquently spoke about their world-famous patient with a doctor-to-doctor attitude. In this way, we obtained the most secret information about the German leader.

Hitler's personal doctors represented a reduced version of the Nazi medical community, from famous scientists to despicable quacks. But the one who dominated Hitler was precisely the latter - a cunning quack. His name was Dr. Morell, and he was Hitler's most trusted confidant and consultant. He was also his health protector.

On the opposite side was the humble Professor Brandt, who was Hitler's personal surgeon and also Germany's most qualified Minister of Health. Between these two extremes was the smug Swiss-German Director of Health, Dr. Conti, who took his own life when he learned that the United Nations was treating him as a war criminal. Fortunately, we had already questioned him for three days before he committed suicide. The other two doctors in Hitler's entourage were relatively unimportant: one was Dr. Giesing, an ear, nose, and throat specialist, and the other was Dr. Gebhardt, the chief surgeon of the Black Guard, who was the last person to see Hitler alive.

### A Page in the History of the Allied Pilot's Difficulties in Haimen

I remember that at about 4:00 am on June 12, 1945, a silver, giant Allied American aircraft crashed in Sian Village, Songji Port, First District, Haimen County, northern Jiangsu. At that time, the tide was high, and the plane suddenly fell into the great waters of the Yangtze River. Eight people died at the time, and three survived: Lieutenant Leetmond, Sergeant Ketchup, and Sergeant Nashto. The three of them landed on the shore in a rubber boat and sat blankly in a thatched hut by the river. Later, the village chief, Ni Zhenxing, learned of the incident and immediately sent villagers to escort them away from the dangerous area and hide them in the reeds. At about 8:00 am, the Japanese had learned the news and immediately led a large number of puppet soldiers and police to the scene, surrounded it on all sides, first tracked down the whereabouts of the American pilots, and then completely dismantled the objects on the plane. At the time, they also seriously questioned the village chief, but the village chief remained steadfast and did not reveal the truth. The enemy army searched the village for several days, but found no clues. That night, the village chief immediately had someone change the American pilot's clothes and send him to a safe area. Unexpectedly, three days later, a traitor reported to the Japanese army, and the captain of the Japanese garrison immediately arrested the village chief and took him to the Japanese headquarters in San Chang, Haimen, where he was subjected to cruel torture and interrogated severely using various inducements, but he was detained for two weeks for not revealing the truth. After the victory, in December of last year, Mr. Bi Fanyu, an advisor to the US Military Affairs Bureau, led a warship to Songji Port, Haimen, to collect the bodies. The village chief met with him and sent laborers to exhume and transport the buried corpses, taking care of everything and sending them to the US warship before shaking hands and parting. This fact, the course of events, has been previously reported by this newspaper, but it was not described in detail. Now, based on what I know, I am reporting the truth to show the contributions of the people to the War of Resistance and the enthusiasm of the Allied forces.

### Hitler's Private Life: Legends Abound to This Day

Although Hitler suffered from chronic gastrointestinal illness, often experiencing nausea and severe cramps, his personal physician did not believe he had cancer, as his enemies hoped. His stomach problems were probably due to his peculiar eating habits and excessive medication. Hitler needed to swallow pills, get injections, and adjust his diet at the slightest discomfort. According to his personal surgeon, Dr. Brandt, a continuous stream of vitamin, hormone, glucose, and other supplemental injections was commonplace for Hitler. Whenever Hitler showed signs of a cold, Dr. Morell would give him as many as six injections of cold prevention medication. No wonder Hitler suffered from various weaknesses.

Although various legends about Hitler's private life circulated, there is no reason to believe his sex life was abnormal. Hitler devoted all his energy to fanatical Nazism, having no time to pay attention to women. Although his doctors confirmed he occasionally had relationships with German actresses, his mistress, Eva Braun, was ultimately his ideal companion, able to give him the love and understanding he needed.

Old-School Prussians drove him to alienation and desertion

July 20, 1944, can be said to be the most dangerous period in Hitler's life, and also the most dangerous period for Germany, because Hitler encountered a planned assassination on this day. The masterminds behind this plan were a group of old-school Prussians, who attempted to trigger various psychological reactions in Hitler's mind, causing him to become alienated and deserted, eventually falling into a mental abyss from which he could not escape.

The German Supreme Command Headquarters was located in a birch forest near Rastenburg in East Prussia, and only absolutely reliable Nazi figures could pass through three checkpoints and penetrate the forbidden zone of the headquarters. The assassination plan against Hitler was carried out here. The perpetrator was Colonel Stauffenberg of the German General Staff. He was the liaison officer between the headquarters and the Berlin Army Department. On the morning of July 20, Stauffenberg arrived at the headquarters from Berlin on a special military aircraft, passed through the black-clad guard posts, and went straight to the conference room. One of his briefcases contained documents, and the other contained a bomb. After he placed the second briefcase inside the oak support at one end of the conference table, his mission was accomplished. It was precisely noon at this time. After Stauffenberg left the conference room, Nazi army, navy, and party officials held their routine meeting with Hitler as usual.

Hitler sat in the middle seat on one side of the long table, with his back to the door. Seated around the table were all high-ranking German military and political officials, but Göring, Himmler, and Goebbels were not present. Admiral Voss became the most important figure in this scene. He was sitting right in front of the support of the long table and had to straddle his legs on either side of the support, but he was blocked by the briefcase, so he used his lower limbs to move the briefcase to the other side. According to Hitler's personal physician, Voss's unintentional act saved Hitler's life.

The bomb exploded with a deafening roar at 12:50 p.m. that day. Generals Keitel, Brandt, Bodenschatz, and Berger were killed on the spot. Admiral Karl-Jesko von Puttkamer, who sat in front of Hitler, and General Freiherr von Freytag-Loringhoven were thrown out of the window and seriously injured. Everyone else present, including Hitler, was injured to varying degrees. The explosive force threw Hitler from his chair straight towards the pillar at the doorway. Just as the roof was collapsing, he dashed out of the door.

Although Hitler suffered serious injuries, they were not permanent. His most serious and lasting wounds were psychological. His eardrums were ruptured, his brain suffered a slight concussion, and his right elbow was severely bruised. He felt dizzy and his hearing was impaired. His right arm was almost immobile, but none of his doctors could find any damage to the joints, muscles, or nerves of his right arm. The doctors concluded that Hitler's inability to move his right arm was a form of hysterical conversion, a physiological reaction caused by unpleasant memories, which gradually eroded his personality. This was a major mental loss for Hitler.

After the Assassination Attempt: The Devil Hitler Foresaw Collapse

Hitler was a man of utmost loyalty, and he accommodated anyone who was loyal to him, regardless of their ability. He considered himself a specially chosen world leader by Heaven. He felt that accepting a disciple was equivalent to bestowing divine grace, and the disciple should express endless gratitude to him. This assassination attempt, which occurred within his inner circle of confidants, could not help but make him feel extremely disheartened. From then on, he dared not fully trust any of his subordinates.

After the assassination attempt, Hitler realized for the first time that his collapse was imminent. At that time, the Soviet army was winning successive victories, pressing towards the German border, while the Allied forces had broken out of the Normandy pocket area, and the Allied air force gradually gained air supremacy over Germany. The bomb had already decided Germany's final fate. Hitler had keen observation skills, and he saw that many of his staff members were risking their lives to eliminate him in order to remove the obstacles to surrender, and he must have believed that Germany was defeated. Although one side of his personality could not accept this conclusion, the other side was controlled by terror and hatred. These uncontrollable emotions eventually led to his suicide.

The most prominent aspect of Hitler's personality was an irresistible true self. Because he felt his status declining, he had to try his best to elevate this true self. It was as if he had two personalities: one that he recognized and one that he needed. He spared no sacrifice to protect the latter – his true self. But the more he tried to elevate this true self, the more he could not resist the pressure of the disillusionment of his ideal.

Refusing to Acknowledge Mistakes: Blaming Others

Hitler had a solipsistic view, believing that he was the only savior of Germany. He was extremely conceited, never admitting his mistakes. This character trait of his was a major threat to his close confidants and subordinates. He often attributed his own failures and mistakes to others.

The diaries of his doctors, Nazi party members he summoned, or any German soldiers never mention Hitler admitting a mistake. In the months leading up to the end of the war, Hitler frequently issued urgent and difficult orders, causing them to often suffer severe reprimands and embarrassing humiliations due to poor handling. Therefore, everyone felt the danger of their positions. If they disagreed with Hitler's opinions based on sound reasoning and spoke frankly to him, they would be denounced as defeatists. Conversely, if they listened and obeyed and fully accepted his views, then they had to work hard to carry them out without any leeway. One Nazi officer once commented that no matter which path you choose, there is a risk of being sentenced to death. Those around Hitler felt trapped in a situation from which it was difficult to escape. In the six months after the assassination attempt, his progressive neurological disorder recurred from time to time. A prominent Nazi figure once said, "Hitler's level of madness is really embarrassing. He often issues urgent orders, only to suddenly revoke them the next day. These orders are both muddled and fragmented, but if someone happens to inquire or ask for an explanation, he flies into a rage."

Gestapo Leader Plotting to Kill Hitler

It is said that Heinrich Himmler, the leader of the German Gestapo, and Hitler's personal physician, Dr. Morell, had a joint conspiracy to chronically poison Hitler. Although there is no conclusive evidence for this, the prescriptions written by Dr. Morell certainly aroused strong suspicion of such intent.

Hitler's other doctor, Dr. Giesing, once out of curiosity, secretly took one of the black pills that Dr. Morell prescribed for Hitler to swallow every day, analyzed it, and found that it contained strychnine and atropine. Regular consumption of these two drugs is very harmful to the nervous system. Morell certainly knew that long-term use of these two drugs would have a narcotic effect.

Due to the narcotic effect of Morell's medications, his deteriorating health, the shock caused by the assassination attempt, and the setbacks in the war, Hitler's spirit gradually collapsed.

The impression obtained from Giesing's last encounter with Hitler clearly illustrates the changes in Hitler's character in the days leading up to his death. In these days, Hitler's conversations were somewhat incoherent and absent-minded. Before one thing was finished, he suddenly shifted to another issue, making it impossible for listeners to grasp his true meaning, thus causing great terror.

The last doctor to serve Hitler was Professor Gebhardt. Gebhardt was the Surgeon General of the Black Guard and the President of the German Red Cross. Gebhardt went to see Hitler at the German Führerbunker at 2:00 a.m. on April 26, forty-eight hours before Hitler and his mistress Eva Braun committed suicide. At that time, Hitler was standing in a small room in the air-raid shelter. Gebhardt told him that Himmler had nominated him to succeed Professor Grawitz as President of the Red Cross, requesting Hitler's approval. Hitler calmly replied, "President of the Red Cross, ah, ah, I am no longer interested in these things. Please do not disturb me." After speaking, he turned around and sat down, as if in deep thought.

### Appeal to "Humanity"

Editor: Seeing the Nanjing dispatch, the salary adjustment for civil servants (including educators, of course) has not yet been decided, which makes me wonder.

(1) National public educators have reached the last breath. The officials of the Executive Yuan are not unaware of this. In the past few weeks, the newspaper has always reported that the decision will be made next week on this issue. Thus, the millions of public educators who are dying are "拼命" (pin ming, risking their lives) to continue breathing. But one next week, two next weeks, despite going on to next week, I ask, how many next weeks can these millions of dying people wait?

(2) Mr. Li Qing of the Legislative Yuan said; "Those who decide the salaries of civil servants do not need salaries to maintain their lives, and all expenses can be paid by the government. No wonder they obstruct the proposal to adjust the salaries of civil servants." Who is this referring to? Perhaps there are too many people, and Mr. Li cannot point them out. We have no chance to know them. But Mr. Li's words are "humane", and none of us can deny them. The officials of the Executive Yuan, who are referred to by Mr. Li as those who do not need salaries to maintain their lives and all expenses can be paid by the government and who obstruct the proposal to adjust the salaries of civil servants, I am afraid they cannot be exonerated.

(3) I really doubt, if the Executive Yuan is indeed the government of China, and the officials of the Executive Yuan are indeed officials of the Chinese government, then these millions of public educators who are dying must not be Chinese. Otherwise, why are they treated with such coldness? Why do they have to endure a "still undecided" even after struggling until today?

I squeeze myself among the millions of public educators who perhaps still consider themselves Chinese, and I suffer the same pain as them. At the same time, I am stimulated by the "humane" words of the Legislative Yuan and moved to say these many words that do not know the importance and disadvantages to make an appeal to "humanity".

The Suffering of Law-Abiding Citizens

Editor: I purchased a house in the former British concession several years ago to live in. After the victory against Japan, the Municipal Land Administration Bureau immediately issued an order stipulating that land registration must be completed between November 18, 1945, and January 18, 1946. Those who applied for registration after the deadline would be fined, or the government would take care of it on their behalf, etc. As a legitimate businessman, I should abide by the law, and it is a necessary procedure. There is no need to wait and see. Therefore, in December of last year, I submitted the ownership deeds, drawings, and documents of the house to the registration office of the Land Administration Bureau for registration and received a temporary receipt. I also asked the clerk in charge when it could be completed. It was said that it would first be measured clearly, then announced in the Municipal Gazette. If there are no objections after two months, I will be notified to collect the official ownership certificate, which would take three months to complete. However, almost half a year has passed since the submission, and the Land Administration Bureau has neither sent anyone to measure nor has the Municipal Gazette made an announcement. Recently, because the expenses in Shanghai are huge, I plan to move back to my hometown and sell the house for travel expenses, so I consulted with real estate agents. They said that the registration procedures have not been completed and cannot be transferred, and the various deeds and documents cannot be handed over. The temporary receipt is not enough to convince people, and there is no way to sell it. Therefore, I had to urge the registration office to issue an official certificate. It was said that after checking the original title deed of the house, the foreign firm that previously managed it had been retrieved and stored in the bureau. According to the drawing attached to the title deed, although it clearly stated how many sections were divided and how much area, and how many houses were built, all the owners of the entire plot of land must completely apply for registration before it can be measured. Because a part of it has not yet been registered, there is no way to handle it. I stated that the original title deed has drawings that clearly indicate the boundaries and area of a certain house, then each house has its own independent basis and can be measured individually. It should not be delayed by the delay of a few people and harm the rights of the majority. If all owners must be present to handle it, what if they never come to register? Will those who have already applied for registration be put on hold forever? The person in charge replied that the bureau has no other way. I think that we who abide by the law and comply with the order to register, the government should provide convenience and expedite the process to encourage us. Why do those who wait and see get freedom, while those who abide by the law are bound and cannot get rid of it? This suffering cannot be expressed. Asking my friends, many of them feel the same way. Please publish this letter in the Reader Opinion column, perhaps the government officials will know to improve.

The Cry of a Small Civil Servant

Editor: I am a small civil servant. My monthly salary is about 70,000 yuan, calculated based on a basic figure of 40,000 yuan and a basic salary of 160 times that. I am grateful to the government for this huge amount of patronage. How can I work hard to repay even a small part of it? However, the rise of prices is increasing day by day. Even gruel soup is hard to come by. I also lack constant property to make up for it, causing my wife and children to cry from hunger. My heart is so worried and indignant that I cannot even speak of my work spirit. Recently, I read in the newspaper that the Legislative Yuan has passed a method to adjust salaries. I was lucky to be able to catch a breath. How could I know that there are people who say that the number is too large and it may be difficult to implement. This is because these people, in addition to their salaries, may have a way to accumulate wealth, or they may have a way to live on air and not eat human food. They see those who cry from hunger and cold as the actions of ordinary people, and they see themselves as superior animals, completely unmoved? Alas! Full of brains and fat, rich as immortals, the sound of wailing is everywhere, but they do not hear it. They bear heavy responsibilities, how can they not feel guilty towards the gods, and feel ashamed? It is time for conscience to be restored! Honest civil servants are already facing a desperate situation. In addition to quickly giving a reasonable solution, do not delay any longer. Otherwise, it will be difficult to avoid the discussion of occupying a position without doing anything. Wei Qing Shang.

### The Political Style of the "Liberated Area"

Editor: After the Japanese surrendered, the occupied areas were gradually recovered. The CCP authorities, disliking that the recovered areas were not revolutionary enough, highly proclaimed the "Liberated Area" and emphasized it. The Germans liberated the Sudetenland and then liberated Czechoslovakia; the Japanese liberated the South Seas and then defined the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere; now China is doing the same thing, which is very interesting. Even if it is a liberated area, the object of liberation is the people. The size and name of the original area are not a problem at all. Why change it? The CCP has never stopped adding districts, setting up counties, and changing names from the Anti-Japanese War to the Liberation. The Japanese changed Ryukyu to Okinawa and strongly referred to the Northeast Provinces as Manchuria. Later, they created names such as Eastern Hebei, North China, Central China, and South China, which had an aggressive effect. Now the Liberated Area has names such as Central Jiangsu and Central China. I don't know what it is for. Even if we take a step back and adopt revolutionary means internally, should major events such as changes in administrative regions be adopted by public opinion, follow legal procedures, and be left to the most restored re-handling?

Everything the Liberated Area does seems to have more contradictions and less sincerity. On the one hand, negotiating, on the other hand, attacking; on the one hand, propagating elite (soldiers) and reduced (government), on the other hand, constantly expanding the army; on the one hand, propagating increased production, on the other hand, ignoring the busy farming season, holding public trials in the morning and meetings in the evening, and everywhere persuading people to abandon production and eat ready-made grain; on the one hand, announcing the Three-Thirds System (Kuomintang, Communist Party, and neutral factions each occupy one-third), on the other hand, creating three-capital struggles to squeeze out the remaining two-thirds of the people; on the one hand, fighting for fields for tenant farmers and fighting for wages for hired workers, on the other hand, exploiting farmers and workers in the name of public grain, public grass, tax deeds, and condolence; on the one hand, confiscating counterfeit currency and legal currency, on the other hand, sending people to use it hard or hoarding goods in other places. Summarizing all these things, there is only one goal, which is: to make the rich poor and the poor poorer. When everyone is poor, it is easier for them to join the army and fight for the country, and let the proletariat dictatorship. This style seems to be copied from the Soviet Union, but it has learned it wrong in many places, and there is really no old democracy or new democracy. May I ask, did the people need a break after eight years of the Anti-Japanese War? Are the national conditions of China and Russia the same? Does the CCP have as long a history in the country as the Soviet Russian Revolutionary Party? Does the upper, middle, and lower classes have as many talents as the Soviet Union? Can the current international situation allow a bloody revolution in our country again? Can helping seedlings grow by pulling them up succeed? The CCP does not understand these questions at all and acts recklessly. A blind man on a blind horse is extremely dangerous! As for the most outstanding performances of the CCP at the lower levels, such as: arresting and fining, fining and releasing, releasing and arresting again and fining again; judging and reviewing, reviewing and judging again; calculating old debts, reporting old grudges, 套　包(tao bao- using one pretext to achieve another, drawing in other concerns), 画鸟他 (hua niao ta - a vulgar metaphor for trickery and fraud); and even劃地爲牢 (hua di wei lao - dividing the land into prisons, setting up roadblocks), sometimes not distinguishing between the subject and object, the prosecutor also serves as the executor, so that the people have a naive and pitiful feeling about the very solemn political work. In the past, primary schools once tried the school market, and children carrying schoolbags also learned to be mayors and bureau chiefs. Helping seedlings grow by pulling them up was considered unacceptable by people with insight. Now the politics of the Liberated Area has become child's play, and it is equally unacceptable.

Some people say that revolutions do not have to choose means. This is not necessarily true. Revolutionary actions are related to the interests of the people. Can we not choose means? In the past, the so-called Li Lisan Line was criticized and liquidated, wasn't it? Is it ready to be re-enacted once now and liquidated again in the future?

Some people also say that workers have no motherland. This statement also needs to be examined. How can the number of socialist men and women fighters in countries such as the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States be less than that in China? When their country is at war with foreign countries, they would rather give up their usual claims and fight for their country, and they would never engage in internal strife. Not only that, even when they take military revolutionary actions internally, they still maintain the economy, currency, and postal service, and never arbitrarily divide and diverge. During the Soviet revolution, the ruble was still the ruble, and the post office still sent letters as usual. Now the Liberated Area has even liberated the currency and postal service, and even the flag has to borrow from others! I hope that intellectuals who care about national affairs will observe, study, and discuss in many ways to increase the people's understanding, and not捧塲 (peng chang - to give uncritical support). At the same time, I also hope that the CCP will re-examine the current situation and see if it is necessary to change its style? Politics and policies are not immutable. If you have done something wrong in the past, correct it quickly now. If you are in a bad mood and insist on going wrong to the end, the consequences are not difficult to imagine. Both sides will be injured, creating opportunities for neighbors or enemies. Revolutionary parties who take saving the country and the people as their responsibility should not do this! Li Qi, sent from Nantong on May 28.

### How to Relieve the Disaster?

To the Editor: I read the article in your newspaper on May 30th by a National Assembly representative discussing the Hunan flood disaster, and it filled me with sorrow. "China starves while Shanghai dances," our allies are anxious for us, how can we, fellow countrymen, bear to sit idly by? The American President has ordered Americans to conserve food for the global famine, and the Standing Committee has also ordered the people of Shanghai to conserve food for the Chinese famine. However, these are just empty words, and ordinary people don't know how to conserve. If I eat less each day, my family might save a little, but indirectly and indirectly, how many grains of rice actually reach the disaster victims? I believe the most appropriate and swift way to relieve the disaster is as follows: (1) The UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) should provide a large quantity of wheat flour and airdrop it to the affected areas. (If this method can be implemented, then if it is approved in the morning, there will be cooking smoke in the disaster area by noon.) (2) Major restaurants, hotels, dance halls, and entertainment venues in Shanghai should temporarily levy a disaster relief donation, which should be settled and allocated on a daily basis. (3) Large-scale biscuit or bread factories should allocate machines to urgently produce disaster relief biscuits or bread, which should be airdropped. If this method is followed, the authorities, UNRRA, restaurants, bread factories, China National Aviation Corporation, and other entities should cooperate to form a disaster relief committee, working together with one heart and one mind, pooling their wisdom and efforts, and the famine can be quickly alleviated.

Respectfully,
Qiu Zulian

### The Great Contribution of St. Dunstan's: New Life for the Blind

St. Dunstan's Home for the Blind has helped blind people regain their self-esteem and confidence, making them feel that they have once again become useful members of society.

When the famous English poet Milton went blind, he comforted himself by saying, "Those who are blind will also serve all of mankind." However, in the past, only a few great figures could satisfactorily engage in thinking or literary work after going blind. For ordinary people, blindness was the end of all their activities, and their lives became parasitic.

During World War I, Sir Arthur Pearson, a prominent figure in England, went blind. He was enthusiastic and active, and he was unwilling to sit still and wait for death. He also thought of other people who had been blinded by the war, and he decided to change the fate of those who had been blinded in combat. Therefore, with the help of friends, he established a training center called St. Dunstan's, which housed blind soldiers and women.

After living in the famous St. Dunstan's training center for one or two years and learning independent skills in work and play, one would feel that a wonderful and fulfilling life was unfolding before them.

Blind people can learn to read from Braille books or listen to specially prepared gramophone recordings of books. They also learn typing, walking independently, and enjoying normal pastimes, such as swimming, horseback riding, singing, and music. They can also play specially printed cards, and they can ride on the back of bicycles. Blind women learn household skills. At St. Dunstan's, there are special instructors, including blind instructors, who know how to teach blind people the skills necessary for these activities. It takes nine months to learn to read using the Braille system.

The work that blind people learn is becoming more and more varied each year. St. Dunstan's often trains basket weavers, but now blind people are often trained to be telephone operators, masseuses, shop assistants, poultry farmers, stenographers, and mechanics. Blind people will increasingly take on industrial jobs, which means they will be able to participate in normal life. What blind people need most is to be able to support themselves. Economic self-reliance restores self-esteem and confidence, because they feel they are once again useful members of society.

Of the men and women who were blinded in World War I, about three thousand have been able to become economically independent. Of those blinded in World War II, about one thousand have come to St. Dunstan's for education so far. Not only British soldiers, but also soldiers from allied countries, are cared for by St. Dunstan's. When each blind soldier leaves the home, the home presents them with a wireless radio receiver and a talking watch.

When blind men and women leave the home, although they have the ability to lead active lives, they can still encounter difficulties. Therefore, the home has a special organization to assist them when they need help. Whether it is work difficulties, family difficulties, economic difficulties, or poor health, the home's welfare or technical visitors are always available to provide guidance and practical assistance.

All those who have been trained by the home wear a medal—the Torch of Life—once a blind person has been trained by the home, they can discover a new and fulfilling life.

If the British people had not provided financial assistance, Sir Arthur Pearson would not have been able to make St. Dunstan's so useful. All training, treatment, and aftercare work at St. Dunstan's is funded by voluntary donations. The British people understand the many obligations they have to those who were blinded while serving the country in the World War. In the last fiscal year, the home's total donations were around 630,000 pounds. People admitted for treatment do not pay fees. Therefore, the subsidies given by the British government can still be maintained.

So how does St. Dunstan's give new life to the blind? There are three stages: hospital treatment, general independent training, and special vocational training.

During World War II, the home received financial assistance from the government and took over a hospital specifically for treating blind people, always trying to restore some sight if possible. The home has its own seaside sanatorium, where blind people can restore their physical health and vitality, because there are comfortable and convenient environments there.

Newly translated from the original work by Thompson

But Gebhardt then said, "Another mission I have here is to help these children and women. I have already prepared a Red Cross car, perhaps the last vehicle to leave Berlin. Could I ask the Fuhrer to order who should leave?"

"Thank you, we don't need help, they are willing to stay here, but you might as well ask them again," Hitler replied, without changing his lost expression.

The room was dimly lit, and everyone was sitting in a disorganized manner, as if waiting for a great disaster to befall them. Gebhardt turned around and asked the others, but no one seemed to care. Finally, Hitler announced to everyone, "Dr. Gebhardt is going to Berlin, this is your last chance. Who wants to go?" There was still no answer. Only one woman shook her head. Then Hitler looked back at Gebhardt and said in a weary and monotonous tone, "You see, no one wants to go with you."

### Explosive Behavior Creates a Destined Demise

Gebhardt's account allows us to clearly see the decline of the spirit that once ruled Germany. It was the spirit of a megalomaniac and sadist. When it accepted the call of the god of death, this spirit finally found rest. Hitler's spirit was not a pathological one. Half of his innate desires were satisfied in his ideology, and half were satisfied by his mistresses. From the behavior of Hitler as described by German psychiatrists and other doctors who observed Hitler for many years, one cannot find any elements of madness.

Hitler reached the highest point of neurosis in his final stages. A psychotic patient or a madman exhibits hallucinations and other qualitative changes in thought, but a neurotic patient exhibits only an excessive expression of normal emotions, that is, a quantitative change.

The ending of Hitler's life was the inevitable result of his explosive behavior. Early success nurtured his arrogant and self-important character, and gradually erased reason and judgment. The endless pursuit of expanding power and the internal struggle with reason and judgment completely burned his spirit in the flames of his own life. Thus, the German dictator destroyed himself.

A life like Hitler's had no other ending than suicide and assassination. As his doctor said, self-destruction was the only goal of Hitler's spiritual development. This was his only way to escape an inevitable fate.

The strike against Hitler's life by Stauffenberg and those involved in the assassination received unexpected gains. Hitler's confidant doctors and psychiatrists believed that this event was a major factor in contributing to Hitler's spiritual bankruptcy and accelerating the collapse of Germany and the death of the German leader. Hitler was trapped by his own devices and ultimately sacrificed himself. He lived arrogantly and died a bad death; it can be said that he received the reward he deserved.

### Gold Bars

— Shao Fu

Paying rent with gold bars seems to have become an established fact in this day and age. Ma Xingye, the president of the Nanjing Central Daily News, wrote an article titled "Two Examples, One Appeal" because the landlord was oppressing him and his chief writer, filled with indignation. At the end, he said:

Unreasonable is unreasonable, no lawyer, no court, no newspaper, no mouth can turn unreasonable into reasonable!

We need courage in the face of unreasonable things!

We want to declare war on greedy, blood-sucking, evil landlords!

Naturally, this is the view of a scholar. What effect does "declaring war" on them have?

"A New Account of the Tales of the World" records the following story:

"Guan Ning and Hua Xin were weeding vegetables in the garden together when they saw a piece of gold on the ground. Guan continued to weed as if it were no different from tiles and stones, while Hua picked it up and threw it away."

There was no so-called housing shortage at the time; otherwise, Mr. Guan and Mr. Hua would have picked it up long ago and used it as a tribute to the landlord.

### Apprentices Also Need to Read

— Chen Mianyu

Of course, I must state that this is not about carrying a schoolbag and entering the school gate to study; but simply saying that in one's spare time, one can take advantage of available free time to choose beneficial books that suit one's needs and preferences to study on one's own, adapting to the realities of the environment.

Because in the vast group of apprentices, there are also many young people who are determined to make progress. They have to work as apprentices for a living, but they have not forgotten their pursuit of education. In fact, apprentices do not have the convenient opportunity to enter school to study; so they embark on this path of self-study through reading.

In terms of motivation and goals, this is of course undeniable and is a legitimate act. But I don't understand why a considerable number of shopkeepers and managers not only discriminate against this, but also absolutely prohibit apprentices from reading. Is it because reading is useful? This is not worth laughing at.

I only realized some things recently after hearing the stories of several friends who had been through this. The biggest reason, or rather, the comprehensive excuse, is that they believe that reading will interfere with their inherent work and affect their own interests.

In fact, this is fundamentally wrong. For example, in the afternoon at a counter shop, when there is nothing to do, why can't the studious apprentices read some books? If they don't leave their posts and don't leave the shop door, how will they neglect their duties? Perhaps some people are overly sensitive and think that if they drop the book halfway, the receptionist will neglect to attend to customers who happen to come. In fact, the apprentices themselves will never do this intentionally. Since they are rational about their efforts in their spare time, they naturally understand their environment. Having the right to read, they will only be grateful, and therefore work even harder, which is a natural emotion.

From another perspective, it has considerable benefits for the shopkeeper: first, apprentices who read books also have a mental adjustment (which can also be called recreation), they will not turn to other bad recreational habits, and naturally there is a normal guarantee for their work; and the bad consequences caused by bad recreational habits, embezzlement, and private gain will not harm the shop.

Second, reading more can increase knowledge and wisdom, and because of the increase in wisdom, apprentices have more skills and insights in serving customers, which naturally makes customers feel satisfied and promotes business development.

Therefore, I want to loudly shout that apprentices also need to continue reading!

### National Flag

— Yu Ti

At present, the national flags hung in Shanghai can be said to be unified in terms of size, flagpole length, and the angle of the iron frame; but these are material unities. In terms of spirit, however, they are scattered and not unified. Such as the following:

(1) Inconsistent times for raising and lowering the flag—When raising the flag in the morning, some do so around 6:00 AM, some around 8:00 AM, and still others don't even know if it's a day when the national flag should be flown, so they don't hang it until the police officers inform them. As for lowering the flag, the times are even more inconsistent. I have seen several places where the flag has not been lowered even after 9:00 PM. Even more absurdly, some even forget to lower the flag, letting it fly in the darkness. Whenever it suddenly rains, the flag should be taken down and not allowed to be soaked in the rain. This point should also be noted.

(2) Inconsistency between full flag and half-mast—On commemorative days for celebration, a full flag should be flown, and on commemorative days for mourning, a half-mast should be flown. There is no need for me to say more about this. However, there are many times when a half-mast should be flown, but a full flag is flown instead. For example, on the anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation, a half-mast should be flown, but in many places, a full flag is flown instead. Furthermore, on March 29th, some say that it is the Youth Day celebration, so a full flag should be flown; others say that it is the Huanghuagang Memorial Day, so a half-mast should be flown. In fact, the national flag should not be flown on Youth Day; a half-mast should be flown.

(3) Common sense regarding raising a flag to half-mast—When raising to half-mast, the national flag should first be raised to the top, and then lowered to one foot from the top. It should never be raised to one foot from the top and then stopped. When flying the flag at half-mast, one should pay attention to whether the distance between the flag and the top of the pole meets the regulations.

I think all Chinese people should pay attention to the above points of common sense.

### How Should Zhou Zuoren Be Punished?

— Cao Zuohan

As the traitor Chen Gongbo said, "Who would dare to say that I am innocent now?" In fact, being guilty, of course, no one says is "innocent," daring or not daring is another issue.

According to news reports, the cultural traitor Zhou Zuoren has recently been escorted to Beijing, and the date of his public trial is probably not far off. It is indeed a pity that Elder Zhitang has fallen into the water and cannot preserve his integrity in his later years. Since the May Fourth Movement, Zhou has always been an important figure in the Chinese literary world, and he has indeed made many contributions to the establishment of the new culture. Even after falling into the water, he is still a relatively large maggot in the cesspool. Even the writers who currently defame him as a "stinky literati" are probably somewhat influenced by his writing. Therefore, in addition to feeling sorry for Zhou himself, I also feel sorry for Chinese culture. There are very few people like him who are well-versed in academic research, and too few people who are well-versed in academic research have left a stain on Chinese culture. How can one not feel sorry for Chinese culture?

This is not to defend Zhou Zuoren and say that he is innocent. He once served as the puppet North China Education Supervisor and a specially appointed official of the puppet National Government. Even a three-year-old child would think he is a traitor. Although he is a traitor, after investigating his crimes, I would like to suggest to the authorities: there is no need to impose the death penalty, but instead replace it with life imprisonment, ordering him to translate the entire history of Greek literature to redeem himself.

This is a book that Zhou had long planned to write but had not started. Zhou's research on Greek literature is indeed profound and beyond the reach of his peers. If he translates it in its entirety, there will definitely be many wonderful parts. It will also be a small contribution to the weak translation community in China.

Sunzi lost his feet and passed down the art of war, and Sima Qian was castrated and wrote the Records of the Grand Historian. If the death penalty is only for the purpose of isolating society, then if Zhou can be sentenced to life imprisonment, with no unscrupulous disciples surrounding him in prison, he can complete his initial wish of translation.

News Snippets

### Wang Xiaolai Says Everyone is at the "Myriad Barrier"

— Feng Yi

The worker index for May has already been announced as more than 4,090 times the pre-war level. At a certain banquet, Wang Xiaolai commented on this issue, saying: "Today, the price of goods compared to the value of money has reached the 'myriad barrier,' that is, 10,000 yuan today is almost equal to one yuan before the war." In Ningbo dialect, it is customary to say that when things reach an unbearable point, it is "myriad barrier," so today it is truly what is called the "myriad barrier"! (Myriad Barrier, Myriad Barrier, a pun, Elder Xiao is a wonderful person, and often has wonderful words.)

Sun Ke gave a speech at a dinner party of the American Alumni Association yesterday. When talking about land taxation, he said that if a piece of land or a building is sold in Shanghai, the government must levy a tax of 40%, according to the Land Law. There is no clear provision in the Land Law, which is actually contradictory. However, he believed that Shanghai had done this first, and it had not yet been approved by the Legislative Yuan. He then said to Mayor Wu, who was sitting next to him, with a humorous tone and a smile: "In the future, I hope that those who set taxes will read the Land Law carefully, so as to avoid similar situations from happening again." At that time, Mayor Wu nodded repeatedly in agreement, causing a burst of laughter.

On Saturday afternoon, the Mayor held a cocktail party at the "Skyscraper," with ladies as numerous as clouds, a magnificent occasion. The international elevator specially opened a "special number" to transport guests, but because there were so many people coming continuously, the queue for the elevator almost reached Park Road. Although not unprecedented, it was unprecedented in scale. According to news from Father Jacques, a total of 600 invitations were sent out for this event, but the reporters at the scene estimated that there were at least 900 guests. When asked, the elevator operators also considered this number to be quite accurate.

The most eye-catching guests at the cocktail party were Chiang Wei-kuo and his wife. Mrs. Chiang is the daughter of Shi Fengxiang, a major industrialist in Northwest China. That day, Mrs. Chiang wore full summer attire, a black and white checkered "sand-tuxedo" cheongsam, and the latest style of glass leather shoes and glass stockings, which was appreciated by the general female guests. Mrs. Chiang also wore a pair of earrings, with red agate inlaid in the middle and diamonds around the outer edge, which was quite delicate. Diamond light competed with the color of glass, all combined into one, adding a lot of color to the cocktail party that day.

After the banquet ended, the reporters talked about the glass leather shoes, confirming that Mrs. Chiang Wei-kuo's glass shoes were the first pair in Shanghai. However, according to well-informed sources, "good news" has been spread: recently, a certain import company has obtained dozens of new pairs of goods to Shanghai, but the "beautiful ladies are afraid that if they are put on sale publicly, there will inevitably be more monks than porridge, so some people have already been inquiring around, preparing to buy them up" to avoid falling behind and missing the fashion.

### The Song of the Filial Daughter-in-Law (The Busy Mother)

— Ba Ling

『One busy thing,

Get up early in the morning to open the window, bright and bright;

Two busy things,

With disheveled hair and dirty face, rush into the kitchen;

Three busy things,

Urge the midday meal as if chasing famine;

Four busy things,

Tidy up, fetch water, wash clothes;

Five busy things,

When school is over, ask about everything in detail;

Six busy things,

Light up the lamp and cut clothes;

Seven busy things,

The child yawns, quickly fold the quilt and spread the bed;

Eight busy things,

In the quiet of the night, sew two more rows on the soles of the shoes;

Nine busy things,

When idle, take him for a walk;

Ten busy things,

Say to take him to marry a wife and children, instead throwing me, his own mother.』

This is a ballad describing the busyness of being a mother. This ballad fully expresses the hard work of a mother managing the household and caring for her children. Therefore, how to support one's mother? How to repay the great kindness of a mother's upbringing? This is something that those who are sons should pay attention to and practice. Otherwise, if one only cares for one's wife and neglects the filial duty to one's mother, no matter what, one has a guilty conscience.

### Ideal Occupational Life

— Wu Zongwen

Human instinct is to satisfy the desire for survival. To satisfy this desire from an economic perspective and the organization of society, everyone must have the capacity to produce and engage in work.

Because in this collective society where people live, one cannot obtain without labor or sit idle and eat; one needs a profession to exert one's ability to the fullest, and then one can take what one needs. This directly allows each person to obtain suitable work to do, satisfying their own desire for survival, and indirectly promotes human culture, increases productive forces, and prospers the social economy, which has a significant impact on the nation and its people.

Occupation and life are closely related. Occupation is a tool for human survival, and there is no distinction between high and low, noble and base; everyone should have one. Occupation is eternal; on one hand, it is for one's own livelihood—self-interest; on the other hand, it is for serving the public—altruism. Based on this belief, everyone engaged in an occupation should adhere to the purpose of living to serve, strengthen work efficiency, and strive to increase production to have meaning and generate interest.

Interest is something that can encourage people to progress, improve their new understanding of things, and cultivate research spirit and a scientific mind. Many successful people in the world, such as great scientists, great inventors, and great entrepreneurs, have succeeded because they have a strong interest in their careers, are not afraid of failure, and continue to research, experiment, and create, achieving success and fulfilling their ideal occupational life that benefits both themselves and others.

However, the current social phenomenon is too disappointing for those of us engaged in occupations. Everyone cannot even obtain the minimum needs for life, wandering and struggling on the starvation line every day. Everyone feels threatened and extremely unstable in their lives, so what interest can they have in their occupations? How is this unreasonable phenomenon created? Who is preventing us from achieving a more reasonable occupational life? This is something everyone engaged in an occupation should study, explain, and strive to fight for.

Our country, after this arduous eight-year war of resistance, has finally achieved unprecedented victory, embarked on the broad road of democracy, unity, and peace, and begun to create a victorious life. In the future process of national construction, there are many arduous tasks that require people in all sectors engaged in occupations to do. As long as we can muster interest, take responsibility, enrich our knowledge, cultivate our skills, and each work hard in our respective positions, doing what we should do, and contribute all our strength, we firmly believe that it is not difficult to obtain a more ideal occupational life.

### Refrigerator · Sofa

### Liu Shi's Fish Exhibition

— Wen Zhaotong

The famous painter Liu Shi, who has been absent from the Shanghai art scene for eight years, has abandoned oil paints and easels in a wandering life, turning to brush and rice paper to paint fish, exerting his consistent creative power.

Liu Shi is the nephew of Mr. Hai Su, a giant in the art world. He has solid shaping techniques and extraordinary expressiveness in art. Due to his innate artistic talent, his expressiveness has developed in many directions. Before the war, he mainly worked with oil paintings, and also dabbled in sculpture and some applied arts. Recently, he returned to Shanghai and indeed embarked on the path of brush painting, so-called traditional Chinese painting. His ability to develop in multiple directions proves that he has abundant talent. It can also be said that he is using different materials to experiment with various expressive effects, rather than catering to the low-level preferences of the general public to create traditional Chinese paintings. Therefore, it can also be said that Liu Shi is an excellent artist who has passed through all departments of the entire shaping art.

Speaking of Liu Shi's artistic style, before the War of Resistance, it was mainly oil paintings. In terms of figures, he had a solid and elegant neo-classical tendency. Landscapes and still lifes tended more towards the tastes of the Fauvist group, especially in the grasp of lines, which are firm, smooth, and meticulous, combined with bright, strong, and calm colors to create a unique picture, making each picture seem to emit a harmonious musical note, expressing the writer's supreme wisdom.

Because Liu Shi has solid shaping techniques and uses materials such as clay and plaster, he produces many sculptural works, and these works are by no means superficially similar, but have an intrinsic qualitative expression, and have a common tendency of modern art. It seems that we can only compare him with Maillot and Bourdelle.

After he went to the mainland in the early days of the War of Resistance, feeling the scarcity of foreign materials, he used inherent brushes and rice paper to paint, and what he painted were indeed aquatic creatures such as goldfish, carp, shrimp, and crabs, as well as lions, tigers, and a few figure paintings. He applied his skilled shaping techniques to the so-called traditional Chinese painting methods that have always advocated subjective expression. These works are very realistic in terms of descriptive techniques, but the brushstrokes, composition, momentum, etc. unique to Chinese brush painting are still completely preserved. It can be said that this is a new discovery in Chinese art, at least in technology, and it is worthy of our attention.

### Farewell to Sichuan on Returning to the Capital after Victory

— Zou Lu

Returning to the capital after victory, the boat heads east (May 28, 1946). The citizens line the banks to see Slope Gong. Ashamed of lacking the great virtue to stay in Western Shu, I rely on united hearts to play a great success. Ten years (I arrived in Chongqing on December 1, 1937, and leave today) of living here made me forget being a guest, and the thousands of hardships I endured made me wonder if I had become an old man. The mountains and rivers are like relatives and friends everywhere, so let's not talk about Yun Fei singing a big wind.

Brief Collection of Remarks

### Robbers Love Perfume

— Wuling Ren

Recently, when playing card games, people often concentrate and become extremely tense at the last card. Therefore, I suddenly realized that in international negotiations, at the final important juncture, news often uses the phrase "let's see the last card," and the use of this adjective is appropriate. There is nothing better than this, using the small to explain the big, and only those who love gambling can best understand the wonderful thing about this.

On the 31st of last month, two robbery cases occurred in this city, with inexplicable aspects: (1) A young man on Nanjing West Road was robbed of a wallet containing over a thousand yuan in legal tender, chased relentlessly, and was shot, almost losing his life. This young man's courageous spirit is admirable, but to say that he risked danger simply because he couldn't bear to part with a thousand yuan (currently, a thousand yuan is only enough to buy a pack of cigarettes) seems unnecessary. (2) The Ma family on Avenue Joffre was robbed, and in addition to losing 100,000 yuan in legal tender and gold pounds, there was also a bottle of perfume. Isn't it strange that robbers also love perfume?

A fair and reasonable suggestion: The eighteen-story Broadway Mansion has at least two or three hundred rooms. Why must it be sold? Amidst the serious housing shortage, why not rent it out publicly, wouldn't that be convenient for both parties?

After Yin County announced that Li Xianzhao was elected as a member of the South Suburb Township Council, at the same time, the High Court Branch announced the fourth list of wanted traitors, and Li Xianzhao was also on the list. After Li saw the report, he took his leave amidst the congratulations of guests. I am very fortunate that the elected council members in Shanghai are all clean.

Han Langen was deemed a collaborator in the film industry and was opposed to participating in the "House of Loyalty" performance. Then, for the many collaborators in various industries who are currently on trial, it is enough to simply prohibit them from re-entering their respective industries. Why must they be arrested?

### The Political Situation and Human Sentiment at the End of the Han Dynasty

— Liu Dajie

The emperors of the late Eastern Han Dynasty were mostly short-lived. Those who succeeded to the throne were generally young and knew nothing, which naturally led to the empress dowager listening to politics, the maternal relatives monopolizing power, and the eunuchs gaining influence. The struggle between women, eunuchs, and maternal relatives evolved into the history of the Eastern Han Dynasty's demise. From the time Emperor He joined forces with the eunuch Zheng Zhong to kill the powerful maternal relative Dou Xian and his brothers, until Yuan Shao led troops into the palace during the reign of Emperor Xian, these ninety years were entirely the world of eunuchs. Although there were maternal relatives like Liang Ji and Dou Wu who wanted to seize power from the eunuchs, they ended up losing their lives and achieving nothing. The power of the eunuchs grew stronger day by day. Those in the court were granted titles and controlled the government. Their relatives and brothers spread throughout the prefectures and counties, extorting from the people, harming the commoners, seizing women, and killing the good. They truly caused the people to live in misery, and Heaven and people were filled with resentment. There are many records in the historical books about their various evils. When we read them, we can only feel anger and sigh. Let's look at the biography of Shan Chao in the *Book of the Later Han*:

"Shan Chao, Xu Huang, Ju Yuan, Zuo Guan, and Tang Heng were all enfeoffed as marquises on the same day, and the world called them the Five Marquises. They all competed to build mansions, with magnificent buildings and extreme craftsmanship. Gold and silver were used on dogs and horses. They took many good men and beautiful women as wives and concubines. All were adorned with precious and extravagant items, imitating the palace people. Their brothers and relatives all governed prefectures and counties, exploiting the people, no different from bandits."

These eunuchs were all meritorious officials who eliminated the maternal relatives during the reign of Emperor Huan. Once they gained favor and seized power, they did all kinds of evil and acted as they pleased. Let's look again at what is written in the *Book of the Later Han* about Hou Lan: "He indulged in extravagance and forcibly seized property. He seized 381 houses, 118 *qing* of land, and built 16 mansions, all with high buildings, ponds, and gardens, with halls and pavilions facing each other, decorated with brocade books and vermilion lacquer, with deep and elaborate systems,僭類宮省·破人居室，發掘墳墓. He captured good people and plundered wives and children." Such ferocity, lewdness, and extravagance were completely bandit-like behavior. When it came to Emperor Ling, he was even more shameless. He called the eunuch Zhang Rang "father" and the eunuch Zhao Zhong "mother." He did no proper business, drove a four-donkey cart outside the city, and sometimes played with dogs in the Western Garden, drinking and feasting for pleasure. He also had palace women open small shops in the harem, selling groceries. He even set prices for selling official titles. A two-thousand-dan official cost 20 million cash, a four-hundred-dan official cost 4 million, a duke cost 10 million, and a minister cost 5 million. The emperor accumulated the money and stored it all in the eunuchs' homes. Such an emperor combined with such eunuchs naturally produced all kinds of chaos and evil in politics. Under such circumstances, it was impossible for a few upright gentlemen to eliminate this evil force. The result was that soldiers led troops into the palace and killed them all.

Since the Western Han Dynasty implemented the private land ownership system, wealthy nobles bought land and concentrated wealth, and the livelihood of the common people became increasingly impoverished. Although Wang Mang once nationalized the land and restricted capital, his policies completely failed. By the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, the power of the noble wealthy had become even more inflated. They had vast fields, magnificent strongholds, and estates, thousands upon thousands of slaves,養無數的勇士刺客, augmenting their evil power. They could resist the court's orders above and exploit the weak commoners and plunder women below. The common people, under such circumstances, could only endure indescribable suffering. Zhongchang Tong said in his "Treatise on Governance and Chaos":

"The houses of the wealthy are connected by hundreds of beams, the fields are full of fields, the slaves number in the thousands, and the followers number in the tens of thousands. Ships and carts trade in all directions. The waste houses and stores are full of all the capital regions. The strange gifts and solid goods, giant chambers can not contain, horses and cattle, mountains and valleys can not receive.妖童美委，填乎綺室，倡謳妓樂，列乎深堂. Important guests wait to be seen but dare not leave, carriages and horses crisscross but dare not proceed. The meat of three sacrificial animals is rotten and inedible, and the pure wine is spoiled and drinkable."

With money and power, who wouldn't envy such a life of enjoyment? Even scholars all strove towards this path. Some used fraud, some used persuasion, some flattered the eunuchs, and some colluded with the powerful clans, disregarding their reputation and abandoning shame, only wanting to achieve their selfish goals. "If someone is cunning and deceitful, then they will obtain it. If someone can obtain it, then people will not consider it a crime. The source has sprouted and become chaotic, and the roads have opened and lead in all directions. Who would be willing for a scholar to abandon glory and accept poverty and hardship, to abandon ease and rush to restraint?" Zhongchang Tong's words are truly the most poignant and realistic. However, the good scholars and common people, seeing such dark and corrupt eunuch politics and suffering economic oppression from the noble rich, could not be without revulsion. People with more advanced ideas and passionate emotions naturally expressed words and actions of dissatisfaction. Thus, famous student movements and peasant uprisings occurred one after another.

Student movements belonged to the intellectual class, and peasant uprisings belonged to the primary production class. Although detailed historical materials about their various activities were destroyed by orthodox historians, we can still see from the fragmented records that their purpose and activities were not the behavior of rebellious ministers and thieves. At that time, the student movement was mainly composed of more than 30,000 university students. Under that chaotic and dark state, they could no longer tolerate it. Thus, they launched powerful attacks on those foxes and dogs of corrupt officials and warmly supported upright people, creating strong public opinion. This public opinion was not without power. Even the eunuchs and maternal relatives could not turn a deaf ear to it. Therefore, both inside and outside the court, they competed to praise and criticize each other, and from the dukes and ministers down, all feared their criticism and eagerly visited their doors. At that time, they supported Li Ying, Chen Fan, and Wang Chang, who had ideas and courage. Although these three people had different official ranks, they shared the same idea of ​​punishing eunuchs, killing local tyrants, and eliminating harm for the people. Because the university students supported them, they shouted slogans: "Li Yuanli is the model of the world; Chen Zhongju does not fear the powerful. We will support the outstanding talents of the world who do not fear the powerful, otherwise, we will repel them." In this way, eunuchs and corrupt officials had to unite to deal with them. The charge was easy to make. "Li Ying and others are raising wandering scholars from the Imperial Academy, forming relationships with students from various prefectures, slandering the imperial court,怀疑风乱俗.” That was enough. Thus, Emperor Ling issued an order to arrest the partisans, arresting more than two hundred at a time. Those who escaped were hunted down with rewards. This kind of bandit behavior could not suppress the youth's resentment, but only stimulated his enthusiasm. Fan Pang said to the interrogating officer, "In ancient times, those who cultivated goodness sought more blessings for themselves. Now, those who cultivate goodness are in great difficulty. On the day of my death, I wish to be buried on the side of Shouyang Mountain." (*Book of the Later Han, Biography of Fan Pang*) Although Li Ying and Fan Pang were arrested and imprisoned, the student movement's group did not disperse, and the power of public opinion did not diminish. On the contrary, it became stronger and more intense. More people joined, and the momentum became even greater. When the eunuchs saw this situation, they realized that they had to carry out a major massacre to suppress this movement. At that time, Emperor Ling was only fourteen years old, innocent and lively, and didn't understand much. He asked the eunuch Cao Jie, "You are clamoring to kill the partisans every day. What do the partisans have to do with you?" Cao Jie was too insidious and knew that he had to use a threatening word. He said that the partisans wanted to overthrow you and become emperors themselves. So the fourteen-year-old emperor was also angered. This action was large-scale. It was not enough to kill eight or nine hundred partisans. All those who were upright, had some ideas, and had some knowledge were implicated, and their wives and children were exiled to the borders. When Fan Pang was being executed, he said to his son, "I want you to do evil things, but evil things cannot be done. I want you to do good things, and I am doing good things, but the result is like this." How resentful and how heavy these words were. No wonder the people on the roadside shed tears when they heard them.

Needless to say, the eunuchs were triumphant, and the student movement failed. A small number of outstanding elements in the intellectual class at that time all died under the swords of the eunuchs. Culture and thought suffered a major loss, and freedom of speech was completely deprived. The remnants of the intellectual world had to hide in the deep mountains or practice Taoism in caves. After Sima Guang finished compiling this history, he said with emotion: "When the world is in order, gentlemen serve in the court, punish the crimes of petty people, and no one dares to disobey. When the world is in disorder, gentlemen remain silent. Because of the calamity of petty people, they still cannot avoid it. In the chaotic world of the partisans, they were not in their positions. The West Sea was横　流, and they wanted to以口舌　之. To assess people, to激濁揚清.撩　蛇之頭，踐虎狼之尾, resulting in personal humiliation,祸及朋友,士类歼灭, and the country followed with ruin. Is it not sad?" On the one hand, he mourned the pitiful deaths of the scholars, and on the other hand, he seemed to blame these people for commenting on the current political situation and suffering extermination because they were not in their positions. We believe that his opinion is wrong. The partisans cannot be held responsible for the country's demise. I think this student movement was a manifestation of the great spirit of Chinese scholars, a manifestation of the great spirit of fighting for freedom, fighting for justice, and fighting for survival.

Next, let's take a look at the situation of the peasant uprisings. Peasants had no knowledge or ideas, and their minds were simple. Their lives were朴質. Their only hope was that the world would be peaceful so that they could cultivate the land and seek food and clothing safely, regardless of whether the eunuchs or the maternal relatives were in power. If officials and rich people oppressed them too much, making it impossible for them to live or die, they would also revolt. The peasants of the late Han Dynasty lived painfully under the hardships of continuous natural disasters, coupled with the devaluation of currency, high prices, and the exploitation of wealthy nobles and officials. As a result, they fled, starved, killed each other, and even ate each other, eventually dying.

"In the third year of Yongchu during the reign of Emperor An, there was a severe famine in Bing and Liang provinces, and people ate each other." *Book of the Later Han*, the third year of Jianning during the reign of Emperor Ling, a woman in Henan ate her husband, and the husband ate his wife." (Ibid.)

"In the first year of Yongle during the reign of Emperor Huan, 32 prefectures and kingdoms suffered from locusts. The Yellow River overflowed, and the people were cold and disorderly. There were hundreds of thousands of households displaced on the roads, especially in Ji Province." (Ibid.)

"When Cao Cao arrived, he buried tens of thousands of men and women alive in the Si River, and the water stopped flowing. He attacked and captured the counties of Xiaqiu, slaughtering all of them, even the chickens and dogs. The ruined villages had no more travelers." (*Annotation to the Biography of Xun Yu in the Book of Wei*)

Cao Cao fought against Yuan Shao at Guandu, "斩首七万余级." (*Annotation to the Emperor Wu Ji in the Book of Wei*)

With natural disasters of floods and droughts, coupled with major massacres and hunger, what way out was there for the common people? Therefore, peasants across the country revolted. During the reign of Emperor Huan, there was Li Jian, who claimed to be emperor, Gongsun Ju, who attacked and killed Hou Zhang, and Shusun Wuji, who was the leader of revolts in Changsha, Lingling, Wuling, and Ai counties. Peasant revolts were almost everywhere. When one revolt was suppressed, another rose up like spring grass after rain. By the time of Emperor Ling, the small organizations in various places formed a large alliance, which was the most famous Yellow Turban Rebellion in history.

The Yellow Turban rebels did not rise up suddenly, nor were they instructed by a cult or the Heavenly Emperor. Teachings and talismans were just a guise, just as the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Boxers talked about what was a religion was一样的. Their only motivation was that they could no longer live in that society and had to find another way out. Thus, some radical elements organized them and trained them. Under the autocratic politics of that time, political activity by commoners was not easy. Therefore, organization and training had a strong religious color, which could both avoid the government's attention and expand publicity. Moreover, Zhang Jiao and his followers were all from the intellectual class, and their propaganda, organization, and planning must have been very good. Therefore, in more than ten years, the followers reached hundreds of thousands, and people from the eight provinces of Qing, Xu, Ji, Jing, Yang, and Yan all rose up in response. "In the spring of the first year of Zhongping, Zhang Jiao proclaimed himself the Yellow Heaven, and his subordinate masters had 360,000 troops, all wearing yellow turbans, rebelling on the same day. The people of Anping and Ganling each held their kings to respond to him." This force was truly not small and was incomparable to the student movement that criticised people. As a result, the peasants could not resist the government army. In less than a year, their leaders Zhang Jiao, Zhang Liang, and Zhang Bao all lost their lives. On the surface, it seemed that the government had won, but in reality, it was not so. The deaths of a few leaders could not eliminate the power of the masses. Their power spread throughout the country. Historical books say: "After the Zhang Jiao rebellion, bandits rose up everywhere and were too numerous to count. The large ones had twenty or thirty thousand people, and the small ones had six or seven thousand people." When Zhang Fei Yan of the Black Mountain bandits rose up, he claimed to have a million troops, and his momentum was the strongest. Seeing this serious situation, the government knew that it could not be solved by force alone. As a result, Zhang Fei Yan was given an official position, and that large group of people was incorporated into the standing army. There were also countless small groups of Yellow Turban remnants, and the government sent troops to fight for many years, but the more they fought, the more there were. Later, Cao Cao came out and recruited them. "He obtained more than 300,000 Rong soldiers and more than 1 million men and women." This number is a bit alarming. So many people lost their means of living in society and revolted. It was a serious social problem, and it was naturally impossible to solve it by using the method of suppressing bandits alone. However, since ancient times, the ruling class in Chinese history has been obsessed and likes to use this dead-end method.

Under such circumstances, the thoughts reflected by the scholars naturally had only two aspects. What was expressed in politics was the legalist doctrine of clear rewards and punishments and rectification of discipline; what was expressed in the view of life was the Taoist philosophy of preserving one's nature and 光義晦. Let's look at Zhongchang Tong, Cui Shi, and Xu Gan, who were known as Confucians at the time. In their works, they all strongly expressed these two colors. On the one hand, they spoke of political failures, and on the other hand, they spoke of Taoist studies. The politics at that time were so dark that they were the crimes of those maternal relatives and eunuchs. Therefore, Zhongchang Tong said with indignation: "If the government is not divided among the families of maternal relatives and power does not enter the gates of eunuchs, if there are no officials who invade homes below and no slanderous ministers in the capital, then the gods of heaven can descend and the gods of the earth can come out." (*治要昌言 in the Book of Tong*) If there were corrupt officials who exploited the people, then they should be punished by law. Therefore, he also said: "As for the time of revolution, if we do not征代用兵, then we cannot settle our careers. The formation of treacherous people cannot be broken if there are no strict punishments." Cui Shi was also a Confucian. He always used a set of theories of Wangzheng Virtue Teaching on weekdays. Later, after looking at the politics at that time, he felt that legalism was indispensable. He said: "刑罚者治乱之药石也，德敎者兴平之梁肉也." (*Treatise on Governance*) Moreover, he also opposed amnesty. He felt that amnesty would only increase criminal behavior. By the time of Xu Gan's *Zhong Lun*, it was even clearer to explain the importance of the rule of law for the politics at that time. In the "Rewards and Punishments" chapter, it is said very thoroughly. This kind of demand for political thought must have been very common at that time. Therefore, as soon as Cao Cao came to power, he implemented strict legalism. However, his kind of legalism did not把当时的政治　　, but only increased the oppression of the literati and deprived them of freedom of speech. Kong Rong, Mi Heng, Liu Zhen, and others all suffered greatly because of this. So　　份子, under that state, had to talk less about politics, or even not talk about politics, and talk more about metaphysical principles. The pure talk of Wei and Jin developed and prospered under this state.

As mentioned above, the Confucians who came from the Han Dynasty had a strong legalist ideology because of the chaos of the politics at that time. However, under that state of massacre and early oppression, the philosophy of life all tended towards Lao Zhuang. Xu Gan　一面攻撃老荘　异端, while speaking about the art of preserving one's body by being humble and self-guarding. Zhongchang Tong described his political ideals in his writings, but his philosophy of life was保性全　，　志乐命. Some people advised him to become an official, and he said: "All　帝王者，欲以立身　名耳. Face name does not always exist, life is easy to die, carefree and　仰, can self-error". His ideal governing, is " 安神開房思老氏之玄虛，呼吸精和求至人之彷每日，與達者數子論道講書，俯仰一樣，錯綜人物. 彈南風之猚操，發清商之妙曲. 消遙一世之上，脾　天地之間. 不受当时之责，永保性命之期，如是可以陵　汉出宇宙之外矣." (*Book of the Later Han, Biography of Zhongchang Tong*) Fame does not always　存, life is easy to die, what is the meaning of fighting for fame and profit? Coupled with the dark politics and incessant massacres. To preserve one's life, one can only be humble and self-guarding, discussing Taoism and books, hiding in the water and mountains, entrusting intentions to Zhuang and Lao. This philosophy of life; is also the philosophy of life of the Wei and Jin people. Therefore, Guo Linzong, who was wise and self-preserving and good at living in a corrupt world,衰　, who isolated himself from the world and died in a cave, and Shen Tu Pan, who saw the opportunity and hid in the tree, became models for the people of that time and became the eminent scholars in the Biographies of Eminent Scholars.

### Sculpture in China

— Liu Shi

Sculpture in China has a long history, but due to a long period of interruption, it has not yet recovered its vitality.

Before the Qin and Han dynasties, sculpture did not have an independent status; it was merely an attached art. When Buddhism was introduced to China from India, there began to be stone statues in sculpture, and these sculptures were mostly made by stonemasons. Artistic expression was not yet considered, but the seeds of Chinese sculpture art were sown from then on and gradually developed.

We can see from the works and many rubbings left over from that time, such as the tomb of the King of Lu in Qufu, the stone figures and stone lions of the Gao Yi tomb, and the steles in various ancestral halls and temples. In terms of subject matter, they are nothing more than "loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness," "stories of sages," "eulogies of merit," and even "scenes of war." In short, 100% are products of feudalism, Taoism, and patriarchal thought. In terms of technique, such as the line carvings on the four walls of the Xiaotangshan tomb and the relief carvings in the Wu Family Shrines, the proportions of various figures, vehicles, and horses are relatively accurate. The vividness of the postures and the fluency of the knife work were all unprecedented before the Qin and Han dynasties. However, the proportions of the various parts of the three-dimensional stone figures and stone lions are far from accurate, but they have a unique style of simplicity and decoration.

During the Three Kingdoms period, sculpture made no progress, and there are few relics. It was not until the Jin Dynasty when Buddhism revived, that large-scale statue making began. At this time, in addition to statues made of lacquer cloth, gilt (also known as hammered gold), and stone, bronze casting also emerged. As a result, the practice of carving statues in grottoes became popular during the Sixteen Kingdoms period of the Five Dynasties. During the Northern and Southern Dynasties, the trend of casting bronze Buddhist statues became even more prevalent. Emperor Ming of the Southern Song Dynasty and Emperor Wu of the Liang Dynasty advocated casting large bronze Buddhas. Emperor Ming of the Qi Dynasty created one thousand statues, Emperor Jianwen of the Liang Dynasty created one thousand statues, Emperor Wu of the Chen Dynasty created one million statues, and there were seven hundred temples in Jinling, Emperor Xuan created 1.3 million large Buddha statues...etc. All of these show the greatness of the projects at that time, which was an unprecedented golden age of statue art in our country. In the Northern Dynasties, Emperor Wencheng of the Wei Dynasty carved five stone grottoes in the Wuzhou Mountains of Datong Yungang (later gradually increased to more than twenty grottoes). When Emperor Xiaowen moved the capital to Luoyang, he carved stone grottoes in Longmen to create temples. From Emperor Xuanwu to Emperor Xiaoming, 800,000 workers were employed over a period of twenty-four years to build Laojun Cave, Binyang Cave, and so on. This shows the prosperity of sculpture in our country at that time. The Qi Dynasty's palace system had a "Grotto Supervisor," a position specifically responsible for managing the construction of carved stone statues. This further proves that if something is advocated by the ruling authorities, its results will surely be remarkable.

As for why the materials for sculpture at that time were mostly limited to Buddhist statues, it can be summarized in one sentence: it was because Buddhism was prevalent, forcing the general public to entrust their spirits to a "illusory God," and the people only sought blessings and avoidance of disasters. Therefore, the ruling authorities catered to this point and built vast and boundless realms in order to win the hearts of the people.

During the Sui Dynasty, Emperor Wen also issued an edict to repair Buddhist temples and newly created more than 100,000 statues of gold, silver, sandalwood, lacquer cloth, ivory, and stone, and repaired more than 1.5 million old Buddhist statues in various places. Emperor Yang carved and cast more than 3,800 bronze Buddhist statues and repaired more than 100,000 old statues... According to historical records, a total of more than 2.103 million statues were made at this time, the largest of which was more than 130 feet tall and was still being constructed. The difficulty of the project can be imagined.

Following the Sui Dynasty, until the late Tang Dynasty, the construction of Buddhist statues was still very prosperous. The skill and standardization of the forms were even greater than those of previous generations. Sculptors had already risen from early forced labor, officials, and servants to the same level as commoners, although they were still not qualified to stand shoulder to shoulder with the literati. By the Tang Dynasty, their social status gradually increased, and the names of the artists began to appear. The famous ones at that time who can be verified today include Yang Huizhi, Song Fazhi, Liu Jiulang, Zhang Xianqiao...etc. All of the above were famous masters of clay sculpture. Stone carving artists included Han Botong, Zhang Shou, Chen Jin...etc. Their statues still exist today, such as the Dunhuang Thousand Buddha Caves, the Baosheng Temple in Wuzhong, and relics in Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Gansu, and other places. Unfortunately, they have been neglected for a long time, and due to natural disasters and man-made damage, many have been destroyed, and few have been preserved. (It is said that a few years ago, a certain warlord used the heads of Buddha statues as targets for soldiers to practice shooting, destroying many.) As a result, they are in a dilapidated state. The national culture has gone bankrupt to such an extent that it cannot but make people sigh.

After the Song Dynasty, the art of sculpture gradually declined. Until now, although it has been influenced by the West again, the seeds sown by the ancients for thousands of years have gradually sprouted a few new shoots. However, just when these fragile new shoots needed to be cultivated, they encountered ruthless storms and the iron hooves of enemy cavalry, which trampled and destroyed them all. Sculpture! Sculpture! Your fate in China is so unfortunate!

### Why is Chinese Calligraphy Art?

— Xu Weinan

The fact that Chinese calligraphy is art has been discussed quite a bit in foreign art circles, but not much in domestic art circles. Everyone has already recognized calligraphy as one of the six arts, so it seems that there is no need to discuss it. However, only knowing that it is so, but not knowing why it is so, is ultimately not a good approach.

Throughout history, there have been many books on Chinese calligraphy, but they all talk about brush techniques and calligraphers, etc., without studying why calligraphy is art. Kang Youwei's "Xu Guang Zhou Bian Ji" (Sequel to Art of Boat-engraving), the editing method can be considered modernized. However, he only discussed the origin of writing and did not mention the reason why calligraphy is art. One or two years before the War of Resistance, a professor at the Hangzhou Art School published an article in the supplement of the Southeast Daily, arguing that calligraphy is not art, which aroused the anger of a large number of artists, who rose up to criticize him. However, the artists who defended calligraphy as art only mentioned superficial points and did not touch on the fundamental issue. As a result, a discussion that lasted for several months ended in a melee, leaving the editor with no choice but to announce the suspension of the debate, ending it inconclusively. Why is calligraphy art? In the minds of most people, it is probably still a question. Now that the Shanghai Fine Arts Association is holding an exhibition, I would like to take this opportunity to express my opinion on why calligraphy is art. I think Chinese calligraphy is indeed art. Many foreigners say that calligraphy is abstract art. My opinion is exactly the opposite. I think calligraphy is the most concrete art. However, this art of calligraphy is limited to people who can read. Those who cannot read only see it as a kind of drawing.

We were originally believers in pantheism. Everything is a god. Writing is of course also a god. The creation of writing, when the sky rained millet and ghosts cried at night, is a myth. Even today, people still attach great importance to writing and cherish written paper, because writing is the essence of God. Calligraphers who sell writing for money, according to the theory of karma, will not have good karma, because they are selling the words of God. Engravers who carve words, which is like wounding the limbs of the characters, even more offend the sacredness of the writing, and will certainly not have good results. The talismans drawn by Zhang Tianshi are sacred, and the talismans are actually a form of writing.

There is really no doubt that our writing is divine. The characters in the dictionary are idols of writing, the embodiment of the writing-god. When we write, we are simply depicting the idols in the dictionary. We have always known that calligraphy and painting have the same origin. In fact, calligraphy and painting not only have the same origin, but even now, each independent character is still a picture. Our calligraphy has always emphasized spiritual likeness, and does not value formal likeness. Therefore, writing in regular and semi-cursive script is considered art. Those who are good at writing cursive script are even called "Grass Sage." Writing neat regular script is looked down upon, this has been the case for a long time, since the Tang and Song dynasties.

Writing is depicting the divine images of individual characters, writing is a form of painting, and writing is naturally an art. I wonder whether my opinion is correct, I still await the guidance of experts!

Long Serial

### Flying Together (44)

— Zhao Qingge

Mrs. Mo, to save everyone's face, endured it at the time, but when the banquet ended in the evening, and she returned to her own room, she gave Li Hua a severe scolding without any mercy. She scolded her for being disobedient, which meant being unfilial, told her that learning opera meant learning skills; and threatened her that if she dared to be so ignorant again next time, she would disown her as a daughter.

Li Hua endured Mrs. Mo's rebuke without saying a word, only swallowing her tears into her stomach! This was the character she had developed since she was a child. She did not speak, but she knew what was what in her heart. Although she was only nine years old, she was like a mature young woman, and she already understood a lot about human affairs. When she was younger, she was influenced by Mr. Mo's education. In the past year or two, due to the changes in the environment, she had gained a lot of practical knowledge outside of books in this adverse current of life. Coupled with her innate intelligence, she was able to distinguish between right and wrong, good and evil. She clearly knew that everything Mrs. Mo was saying and doing now was wrong and bad; however, she was unwilling to argue, because she also knew that "arguing" was equal to zero, and Mrs. Mo would not listen to her. Besides, Mrs. Mo was, after all, her mother, and she had read the "Daughter's Classic." In order to abide by the principles of conduct taught in the book, she had to be filial! In order to be filial, she had no choice but to obey! In order to obey, she wronged herself and remained silent. Although she was very resentful and sad at this time!

Mrs. Mo saw that Li Hua looked very sad, but she did not cry. She was afraid that she would become ill, which would ruin her own hopes and dreams. So, she hurriedly changed her attitude and said in a gentle tone, half- coaxing, half-threatening:

"Mom only has you as a daughter now. Your brother is unfilial, and I won't pay attention to him anymore. As long as you listen to Mom, it's worth it for me to have doted on you. Mom is asking you to learn opera for your own good. As the saying goes, "Skill is never a burden"! If you have skills, not only will you be successful when you grow up, but I will also have someone to rely on when I get old! Otherwise, we have no family property and no rich and powerful relatives. What will we do in the future? I'm afraid we'll have to beg for food!"

This set of grand principles made Li Hua even more speechless and felt even more serious oppression! It almost crushed her weak soul! She bit her lip and decided to meet the impending calamity and the endless darkness of the future!

"Okay! Go to bed early and get up early tomorrow. Your teacher said that the best time to practice singing for opera is in the morning, and you can practice your skills with your Uncle You in the afternoon."

After Mrs. Mo finished this unhappy negotiation, she returned to her dream of vanity like a victor!

Li Hua hardly slept all night, and she was anxiously worried about the life that was about to begin tomorrow!

The next morning, Mrs. Mo woke up the two little sisters early in the morning. (Now, Li Yun still lives with Mrs. Mo.) Li Yun did not think so much or worry so terribly as Li Hua did. Naturally, it was also because she did not have Li Hua's wisdom. Her view of all human affairs was extremely innocent and simple. Her desire to play was still strong, and she regarded learning opera as nothing more than a new game, so she was very happy. But when she discovered the worried look on Li Hua's face, she could not help but be surprised. She asked Li Hua, but Li Hua ignored her. She also thought that maybe it was still because of what happened yesterday, and she had offended Li Hua and made Li Hua angry with her.

"Sister! Even if I was wrong, is that okay? You can scold me, you can beat me, just don't ignore me!" Li Yun pleaded.

Li Hua still did not open her mouth. She did not want to say anything, she knew that Li Yun would not understand even if she said it. She deeply felt that there was a distance between her and Li Yun.

Zhang Xian came, wearing a black satin melon-shaped cap with a red silk knot on top. He was wearing a blue silk gown with the sleeves rolled up high, as if deliberately revealing the sky-blue silk lining. On his feet, he wore a pair of black-ringed floral satin shoes and snow-white silk socks. Others thought he looked vulgar and unbearable, but he himself was very proud and thought he looked very handsome. As soon as he entered the door, he first took off the eating tool he carried with him—the Hu Qin—from his waist and carefully placed it on the table. Then, he took out two handwritten opera scripts from his sleeves. He put on a dignified and respectable air of a teacher. This was also because he had lost face yesterday, so he deliberately changed his attitude today, thinking of showing Li Hua his power, so that Li Hua would be afraid of him in the future.

### Returning Home

— Lu Yu

After being away from my hometown for nine long years, I finally rushed from Western Zhejiang to Hangzhou, and then took the train back. After arriving at the station, I jumped off the train and looked at the scenery in front of me. Ah! This is the hometown that I have been missing day and night for nine years. I don't know why, but I was so happy that I almost jumped up.

Stepping onto the street, I quickly opened my eyes and looked around. I felt that the unfamiliar shops standing on both sides made me suspect that this was not the place where I had grown up since I was a child. When I quickly finished walking down a west street and turned the corner, I arrived at my own home. I ran into the courtyard, and my father was sitting in the courtyard smoking a water pipe. Hearing the sound of footsteps, he looked up. At first, he seemed to be looking at me with a strange look in his eyes. When I walked closer, he finally recognized my face and said in surprise:

"A Xin! You're back! The war has been stopped for a few months, why are you so late to come home?"

"I wanted to come back a long time ago, but I only recently received the demobilization order..." Before I could finish speaking, my younger sister had already heard the sound and ran out from inside. But she could no longer recognize that I was her second older brother.

"Pin Guan is fatter than before," I said, holding her hand.

"Little girl, don't you call out 'Second Brother'? Don't you recognize him? Silly!" Father said with a smile.

"I don't blame her, she was seven years old when I left. Of course she doesn't remember," I said, and walked into the living room with Father.

"Where is Mom?" I asked Father.

"Your mom died five years ago..." Father said, pointing to the photo hanging high on the wall. I hadn't noticed it before. When I heard this strange news, my nerves went numb and my hands felt cold. I dropped the suitcase in my hand and finally couldn't help but cry.

"What disease did she have? Why didn't you ever mention it in your letters?" I said, somewhat blaming Father.

"At that time, you were still in training and couldn't come back. Telling you would be in vain..." Father's deeply sunken eye sockets already showed a red circle.

At dinnertime, in addition to two regular dishes, Father specially asked Aunt Yun to add a plate of salted chicken, which I used to love to eat. However, I was thinking of my deceased mother. When I left this house nine years ago, my mother smiled and sent me to the door and said:

"Xin! I always hope that you will be successful in the future." My mother's reluctant and kind face is still deeply imprinted in my mind. I didn't expect that now I would still be returning with empty hands and could no longer hear my mother's voice and see her face. I thought to myself sadly, "I'm too sorry for my deceased mother." Although there were good dishes, I couldn't even swallow a bite of rice.

### Going to School

— Zhang Wanqing

I took my child to school. As soon as I walked into the school gate, there was a mud pit in front of me. Needless to say, the child was upset, and I also became annoyed: "It's like this every day—it's so troublesome if it rains!"

I held the child over, close to the base of the wall. My toes were tight against the wall, so I didn't get my clothes dirty. I looked at the heel of my shoe and it had already stepped on a pile of mud. I was about to bend down and wipe it when a nanny shouted loudly from behind:

"Hurry up, other people still have to pass by!"

I stepped to the side, and a patch of mud had smeared onto the child's little pants at the base of the wall.

"What kind of broken school is this? I'm really angry. If I had known it was such a mud pit, I wouldn't have sent my child here!"

"Isn't it just because it's close to home and it's easier for adults? When it rains, how many schools in Shanghai aren't mud pits?"

A lady behind me also chimed in.

A long string of us, calling out and pushing each other, finally got our little darlings into the classroom. The classroom was very narrow, the floor was caved in, and there were only fifty or sixty small chairs, but more than a hundred students were enrolled. Two teachers were busy and sweating profusely. Just as they pressed one student into his seat, another stood up and ran away.

"Aunt Wu, go and catch him!" the teacher instructed.

"Oh! Why can't I find Liu Bingsheng?" Another teacher was checking the class roster.

"Mom, Mom, I want to go home, I want to go home!" A little girl in a red wool sweater tugged at the corner of a fat woman's cheongsam.

"Sister, sister, where did sister go?" A little boy of about five or six years old sat on a small chair and cried sadly, with a big new schoolbag hanging around his neck.

"I'll pick you up in a while. Listen to the teacher properly!" The parent spoke while holding a child who was a little over a year old. "There's really no way, there are too many children and they can't be looked after. The school can at least keep him for a few hours—at home, he'll run to the street in the blink of an eye."

"Aunt Wu, Aunt Wu, quickly get a washbasin!"

"Oh, the washbasin isn't enough, what about a chamber pot?"

"Oh, it's leaking here too, it's all hitting my head. Quick, quick, quick, anything will do!"

"There's nothing left, only the chamber pot—is it okay for the elementary school students to pee in?"

"Okay, okay, okay, bring it quickly!"

The voices of people and the sound of rain mixed together. The rain from the roof floated into the window, and the water outside the door flowed into the room. The classroom immediately became a river, and the children stopped crying and clapped their hands and laughed.

I picked up my child and rushed out into the rain. Both of my feet sank into the mud. I had thrown away nine thousand yuan in tuition for nothing. I got sick with my child and only got better after two weeks. I'm not sending my child to school anymore.

"That's right, our Liu Shun'er is the same. Because of this, even the old nanny doesn't want to work in our house anymore. She said, 'It's the same no matter where I work, but here, you have to go around several corners of the street to get food...'" A lady from the north was also saying loudly.

"Oh, Papa!..." Like a little pig about to be slaughtered, he chased out with a high-pitched voice. In the courtyard, he circled around his father, and the teacher also came out to catch him. The teacher went to the left, and he hid on the right. The teacher went to the right, and he hid on the left. The father got angry and slapped him: "You worthless thing!"

"Huh? Why did this child pee all over the floor? Aunt Wu, Aunt Wu, come quickly!" Another teacher was calling for help.

"Let's all play hide-and-seek together, one two three four...Sign up, why aren't the old students doing it anymore?"

The children ran all over the place. Two teachers and a nanny, having used up all their energy, each showed their great skills:

"Sit down, sit down, stand up, stand up..."

The parents were both the cheerleaders and the disciplinarians and the judges.

"Oh, what's wrong with you?" The Liu Shun'er mentioned above climbed onto the teacher's organ.

"Get down, get down, get down quickly,..." The teacher went over and picked him down.

Liu Shun'er was not convinced and cried out with a "Waaah" sound.

"...Mama..." A little girl's foot was stuck in the floor crack.

"They won't fix the floor, but they can't reduce the tuition!" the mother muttered, trying hard to pull the child out of the floor crack. The two teachers both blushed and stared at her without saying a word.

In the midst of the commotion, the rain fell again outside the door, pattering, splashing directly into the classroom.

The rain got heavier and heavier, and there was also a sound on the roof, pitter-patter...

### The Education of Deaf-Mute Children

— Ri Xi

It is undeniable that our country is still in a stage of poverty. Before education is universalized, we certainly cannot aim too high and far, discussing how to establish deaf-mute schools, how to equip them, and other such issues. These seem not to be the immediate priorities. However, we are not the creators; we cannot, because there are no deaf-mute schools, prohibit the birth of deaf-mute children, nor can we, after they are born, let them spend their lives without education. For the congenital or acquired misfortune of deaf-mute children, every mother should take responsibility for educating them. Here, we might as well look at the true story of how Mrs. Newman in America took on the task of educating her own deaf-mute children.

Mrs. Newman was the wife of a clergyman, with an ordinary family background. Unfortunately, however, her four children, born one after another, were all born deaf. All her relatives and friends advised her to send them to a deaf-mute school, but she did not follow their advice. She had another idea in mind, namely to educate them herself. She taught the deaf-mute children to watch how the lips trembled, to distinguish what sound was being made, and how to say that sound. She declined all unnecessary social engagements, concentrating on educating her unfortunate children.

She believed that if the children failed to pronounce the sounds correctly, she should take responsibility for the failure; it was not the children's fault. The children began special education at the age of five or six. When she taught each word, she repeated it tirelessly, even forty or fifty times, calling the children's attention to her lips. To enhance the children's interest, Mrs. Newman often came up with games related to speaking, to have the children practice speaking. When they made progress, she would then teach them other new words.

During this period, Mrs. Newman's home suffered a fire, and almost everything was lost. But this did not diminish her confidence or undermine her will. She continued to work hard to educate her children. As a result, all four children were able to speak, although they still could not hear any sound. However, when they grew up, one became a state musician, one became an artist, one became a writer, and one was still studying dentistry at university. This academic achievement has a close relationship with Mrs. Newman's encouragement and cultivation.

From this example, we can see that a mother's determination and perseverance have a great impact on her children's happiness, while the quality of educational facilities is secondary. It is hoped that mothers will try Mrs. Newman's methods and spirit with their unfortunate deaf-mute children.
