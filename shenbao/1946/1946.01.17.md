### Unifying Military Power and Large-Scale Troop Reduction: The Subcommittee Can Complete Its Work; Seventh General Meeting to Be Held Today

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 16th] The General Assembly Government Organization Subcommittee is scheduled to meet today at 4 PM in the National Assembly Auditorium. The Peaceful Nation-Building Outline Group is scheduled to meet at 9 AM tomorrow morning at the Supreme National Defense Council. The seventh general meeting has been rescheduled to 3 PM tomorrow afternoon and will still be held at the National Government. Zhang Junmai is expected to fly to Chongqing tonight.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 16th] Zhou Enlai stated the origins of the Party's army, saying that the Nationalist Party's leadership of the army indeed has its revolutionary history, but the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was also forced to take up arms. Zeng Qi sympathized with the former because of the Huangpu Military Academy's training and the Northern Expedition's unification, which were justified; the latter also had its difficulties. When Lu Dingyi stated that the nationalization of the army and political democratization should proceed in tandem, he repeatedly clarified that the CCP's army was forced to take to the mountains out of desperation, adding an explanatory footnote to Zhou Enlai's words.

[United Press, Chongqing, 15th] CCP representative Dong Biwu proposed at the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) today, advocating for a significant reduction in the power of the National Government Chairman, to respond to the Nationalist Party representatives' proposal for government reorganization. The CCP proposal suggests that all orders issued by the Chairman must be approved by the National Government Council, which should be reorganized to include representatives from all parties and factions, becoming the highest decision-making body in the country. A two-thirds majority vote in the council would be able to veto the Chairman's actions. Although heated exchanges occurred during today's PCC meeting, it generally proceeded smoothly. The CCP strongly advocates for the "three-thirds system," where the national political leadership is composed of one-third representatives from the Nationalist Party, one-third from the Communist Party, and one-third from non-partisan groups.

[Our Report] San Francisco, 16th Broadcast: According to a telegram from Chongqing, the Military Subcommittee can complete its work within one month, and the Communist Party's army can be reorganized within two months. At the same time, the Chinese government is prepared to unify military power, establish a Minister of National Defense, implement troop reductions, immediately reducing to one hundred divisions, and after a considerable period, further reducing to sixty divisions.

[United Press, Chongqing, 16th] Zhang Qun announced today that the government, in accordance with the Nationalist-Communist agreement, is expanding the National Government structure. A three-person subcommittee has been formed today, with Zhang Qun representing the National Government and Zhou Enlai representing the Communist Party. At today's PCC meeting, Zhang Qun expressed hope that the three-person committee would reorganize the Communist army within three months. He also proposed that the Chinese army should be reduced from 4.8 million to 1.8 million.

[Another Telegram] It is anticipated here that as a result of the PCC meeting, the government may undergo a thorough reorganization and reassign ambassadors stationed abroad. If representatives from the CCP and other parties join the administrative structure, some ministers will be reassigned.

### Sixth Meeting of the Consultative Conference: Discussing the Nationalization of the Army; Only by Laying Down Arms Can We Talk About Democracy and Constitutional Government

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] The sixth meeting of the PCC was held at 9 AM on the 16th, attended by thirty members including Wang Yunwu. The agenda concerned military issues, with proposals from the Youth Party and the Democratic League, explained by members Chen Qitian and Liang Shuming, respectively. The assembly also requested Deputy Minister of Military Administration Lin Wei to attend and report on the progress of military reorganization. Zhang Qun, Zhou Enlai, Shao Lizi, Zeng Qi, Zhang Dongsun, Zhang Shenfu, Lu Dingyi, and others successively expressed their opinions on the issue of the nationalization of the army and decided that the subcommittee would summarize the various opinions and submit them to the assembly for discussion. At the beginning of the meeting, Secretary-General Lei Zhen reported the number of attending members, and Chairman Sun Ke asked member Chen Qitian to explain his proposal. Chen first stated the purpose of the proposal: (1) to end disputes and achieve unity; (2) to concentrate efforts on strengthening construction; (3) to strengthen unity and stop the civil war; (4) to unify and streamline, and strengthen national defense. Chen emphasized that the nationalization of the army is to build a strong national defense force against foreign aggression, not a force for internal warfare. Talking about democracy and constitutional government under the barrel of a gun is false. Only by laying down arms can we talk about democracy and constitutional government. Chen then explained the specific measures he proposed for implementing the nationalization of the army. Liang Shuming, representing the Democratic League, explained that he agreed with the Youth Party's advocacy for the nationalization of the army, but emphasized large-scale troop reduction and actively engaging in the construction of modern fundamental national defense, namely (1) scientific research, (2) industrial construction, and (3) universal national military training, to strengthen national defense capabilities and jointly seek world peace. He also proposed establishing a Military Planning Committee to implement the nationalization of the army and the task of reducing the standing army, to be completed in stages. Zhang Qun said that according to the ninth item of the government's talks with the CCP, the CCP's army will be reduced. Regarding the number of troops and their stationing, both parties have agreed to have the Military Three-Person Subcommittee discuss the matter. Unfortunately, military conflicts occurred afterwards, and the subcommittee's work was delayed. Although the ceasefire order has now taken effect, reports of conflicts still occurring in various places are received daily. Therefore, the Three-Person Subcommittee needs to be established as soon as possible. Chairman Chiang has appointed Minister Zhang Zhizhong and himself as government representatives, and the CCP representative is Zhou Enlai. Preliminary discussions began yesterday, and it is hoped that a solution can be agreed upon within one month, and the reorganization will be completed within two months. From the date of the agreement, the CCP's army should immediately accept the unified command of the National Government. Zhang expressed hope that the Three-Person Subcommittee would be able to accomplish its mission.

[Public News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] Today's PCC meeting was held in the National Government Auditorium, discussing the difficult problems of reorganizing and reducing the Chinese army. Chen Qitian, leader of the Youth Party, proposed a broad outline for the reorganization of the army, advocating for the establishment of a Minister of National Defense and a unified command. He demanded that the army should break away from party affiliations and only be used to resist foreign aggression. He also suggested that a legislative body should supervise the army, and its size should be immediately reduced to one hundred divisions, and later further reduced to sixty divisions. He advocated organizing a committee responsible for implementing the reorganization and demobilization work. Liang Shuming, leader of the Democratic League, agreed in principle with Chen Qitian's proposal, suggesting that the reorganization committee should have five to seven members, including three American advisors, to implement a one-to-two-year plan. Zhou Enlai immediately proposed that the National Army and the Communist Army should be reorganized simultaneously. He agreed to reduce the Communist Army to twenty divisions within six months. Shao Lizi and Zeng Qi suggested that military issues should be resolved separately by the Communist Party and the Nationalist Party, but other representatives insisted that military issues are related to all the people and should not be resolved solely by the two parties. Deputy Minister of Military Administration Lin Wei proposed that the number of National Army troops should be reduced from 4.83 million to 1.8 million in the first half of this year, that is, from 253 divisions to 90 divisions, plus ten cavalry battalions and other special forces. It should be implemented in stages, with each stage lasting three months. The demobilized soldiers should be employed in public works, with 200,000 people building railways, 200,000 people building highways, and 160,000 people engaging in river dredging projects. Demobilized officers, except for a portion sent to the Central Training Corps for vocational and technical training, will all be demobilized.

### Deputy Minister Lin Reports on Military Reorganization

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] Deputy Minister of Military Administration Lin Wei attended the PCC on the 16th and reported on military reorganization measures. The full text of his report is as follows: Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, I have been ordered to report on the military reorganization plan and its implementation, which I intend to divide into two stages: the military reorganization situation of the past year and the military reorganization plan for this year. I will explain them separately as follows:

Military Reorganization Situation of the Past Year: First, Reasons for Military Reorganization: Examining the reasons why our country's army must be reorganized, since the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1937, the total number of troops was 49 armies, 128 divisions, and 30 brigades. Subsequently, due to the start of the war and the gradual expansion of the battlefield, by the end of 1944, it had expanded to 129 armies, 354 divisions, 31 brigades, and 15 battalions. This expansion rate, at most, was only double. According to the principle of war mobilization and based on war examples from various countries, it was originally not large. However, due to the low quality of the troops, the number of vacancies gradually increased. Although the numbers increased, the combat effectiveness decreased instead, making reorganization necessary. This is one reason. Secondly, due to the limited financial and material resources of the country, and the deep suffering of the people, it was impossible to continue bearing such a huge military expenditure. This is another reason. In short, the reorganization of the National Army is not only a unanimous request of the Chinese people, but also a unanimous hope of people in allied countries. This military reorganization policy is related to the victory or defeat of the War of Resistance and the lifeblood of the country. The central government originally had a set policy, but due to environmental constraints, it was only decided to implement it last year. The ministry followed the central government's decision and began to work hard to implement it at the beginning of last year. Second, the Purpose of Military Reorganization: The purpose of military reorganization is to adjust the current large and complex army into a necessary and substantial national army. In other words, military reorganization is not a passive reduction of the army, but an active effort to strengthen the combat power of the troops. Before the enemy surrendered, it was used to prepare for a counter-offensive, and in the future, it will be used to consolidate defense and cooperate with allied countries to maintain lasting world peace. Therefore, the military policy set by the ministry for 1945 was: one, to cooperate with the requirements of the counter-offensive and strengthen combat power; two, to cooperate with the national budget and take into account the national financial and material resources. Third, the Central Task of Military Reorganization: The central task of military reorganization can be roughly divided into (1) reorganization and strengthening of troops, (2) improving the lives of officers and soldiers, (3) adjusting military agencies, and (4) settling surplus officers and soldiers. Reorganization and strengthening of troops is the most important task to strengthen the forces of the troops. The ministry measured the requirements of the War of Resistance and the situation of the troops and formulated the principles for the implementation of reorganization in 1945 as follows: (1) All troops should be reduced by one-third. For the convenience of implementing the reorganization, each war zone should be taken as a reorganization unit. That is, a war zone with three armies under its jurisdiction should reduce one army. An army with a three-division system should merge one division. For an army with a two-division system, there are two methods of reorganization. If both divisions retain their numbers, each division should reduce one regiment. The missing regiment will be supplemented by other troops to strengthen its structure. If only the military headquarters and one division are retained, the number of one division must be revoked, and its soldiers transferred to the military headquarters' directly affiliated troops and the retained division. Another division that has completed reorganization will be transferred to strengthen its structure. (2) The reorganization plan for each troop is drafted by the ministry based on the principles and implemented by the war zone. If the war zone makes changes due to actual difficulties, as long as it does not violate the principles, the ministry can approve it. (3) The surplus soldiers of the reorganized troops will be supplemented uniformly, and the vacancies of the reorganized and retained troops will be filled to reduce the number of empty units and increase their actual strength. (4) After each troop has implemented the reorganization in accordance with the reorganization principles, it can start to issue new pay. Troops that have not implemented reorganization in accordance with the principles will still issue old pay. For example, if a certain troop completes the reorganization first, (not finished)

### Proposal by Zhang Lan and Eight Others

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] Member Zhang Lan and eight others submitted a proposal on "Realizing the Nationalization of the Army and Large-Scale Troop Reduction" to the sixth meeting of the PCC. The full text is as follows: The undersigned propose that this meeting, in order to lay the foundation for national unity and establish a modern national defense, should adopt the following two principles: (1) All armies in the country should immediately break away from any party affiliation and belong to the state, achieving complete unity of military command and administration (active-duty soldiers must leave their party affiliations). (2) The number of standing armies should be drastically reduced, and active efforts should be made in scientific research, industrial construction, and universal national military training as a fundamental plan for modern national defense. In order to realize the above-mentioned first principle and the point of large-scale troop reduction in the second principle, a Military Planning Committee should be established immediately. This committee should be composed of five to seven members, including the following personnel: (1) military personnel from both domestic parties, (2) military personnel from non-partisan groups, (3) military personnel, and at the same time, one to three American military experts should be hired as advisors to this committee. If necessary, they may be invited to attend meetings or entrusted to assist in planning work. A deadline of one month should be set to formulate all feasible and concrete plans. This plan should achieve the goal of unifying the army under the state and reduce the number of standing armies to the smallest possible extent without hindering completion in stages within two years.

The above plan should be submitted by the committee to this meeting for review and approval, and then implemented by the National Government. During implementation, the committee should still be responsible for supervision and review until the task is completed. The above is presented for the consideration of the general assembly for a decision. Proposers: Zhang Lan, Liang Shuming, Luo Longji, Huang Yanpei, Shen Junru, Zhang Zhongfu, Zhang Dongsun, Zhang Junmai, Zhang Bojun.

### Plan for the Rehabilitation of Honored Veterans Has Been Drafted

[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 16th] It is learned that the Ministry of Military Administration has drafted a national plan for the rehabilitation of honored veterans. It will soon be submitted to the highest authorities for approval before it can be implemented. The plan proposes to reorganize the existing eleven Honored Veteran Management Offices into Honored Veterans' Aftercare Administration Bureaus. Five bureaus will be established nationwide, with attached reclamation corps, production cooperatives, and schools for the children of honored veterans.

### Changxing Establishes Command Post, Sun Yuanliang Concurrently Serves as Director

[Central News Agency, Changxing, 16th] The director of the Changxing Command Post of the First Pacification Zone of the Xuzhou Headquarters, concurrently held by Sun Yuanliang, has been established and has begun pacification work. The area under its jurisdiction includes twenty counties in the border areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, including Yixing, Liyang, Wuxing, Jiaxing, Guangde, Ningguo, Wuhu, and Xuancheng. The Jinghu Pacification Work Supervision Group has also set off to various places to carry out supervision work.

### Although the Mediation Department Is Working, Conflicts Continue to Occur

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] The Military Mediation Execution Department (MMED) is scheduled to start working at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital on the 16th. Robinson, Zheng Jiemin, and Ye Jianying discussed this matter this morning. Today, reporters asked personnel from the three parties about the situation of the cessation of conflicts. All answered that the communication lines had not been established yet, and no reports had been received from all parties. The three commissioners also agreed that they would issue press releases for future events and not make separate statements. Yesterday and today, the three men have been active separately. Ye Jianying visited Chief Sun and Mayor Xiong this afternoon. It is heard that Director Li Zongren will welcome the personnel of the MMED to Beiping tonight.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] The MMED will send small groups composed of the Nationalists, Communists, and Americans to various conflict areas to investigate the truth and implement mediation. It is expected that there will be one group every hundred li, and more than 400 personnel of the MMED will fly in one after another. The authorities are quite concerned about the reception of these large numbers of guests. Huang Renlin has considered moving out the less important guests of the "Beijing" and "Six Nations" hotels to accommodate these peacemakers. To facilitate the residence of Communist personnel, the authorities have designated Cuiming Villa as a special residence. This building is also in the East City. Before the war, it was the residence of Mei Lanfang, and during the occupation, the Japanese used it for welcoming guests. After the victory, many Northeast personnel traveling between Chongqing and Changchun stayed here. The three groups of personnel of the MMED will start working at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, which has been closed for a long time, tomorrow. Paul Wen, the director of general affairs of the hospital, who was once regarded by the Japanese as one of the three major foreign political prisoners during the occupation, has vacated most of the good rooms for their use. Bao Wen told reporters in a pleasant tone that when the authorities came to borrow the hospital as the office of the MMED, he readily agreed, because their great mission is of great importance to China's peace and the overall world situation. The hospital is very honored to be their office. On the first two days after the ceasefire order was issued, both the government and the Communist Party received reports of continued conflicts. For example, Lu Wenzhen told reporters on the evening of the 13th that there were more than ten reports of Communist troops attacking on the 12th and 13th. Ye Jianying also said in his speech after getting off the plane that when the plane took off from Chongqing, he had received a report of a conflict in Lingyuan Gubeikou. But as of today, reports of conflicts in the north have indeed gradually subsided. The price of grain in Beiping is also falling day by day, and smiles are gradually appearing on the thin faces of the citizens.

### Minister Wu Hopes the Communist Party Will Abandon Meaningless Propaganda

[United Press, Chongqing, 16th] Minister of Propaganda Wu Guozhen expressed great regret when he met with reporters today regarding the Communist Party's criticism that "the National Army violated the ceasefire order." He deeply hoped that the Communist Party could abandon "unconscious propaganda." Regarding rumors that Madame Chiang had gone to Shenyang, Minister Wu declined to comment.

### The MMED Issues a Public Notice

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] The MMED issued its first press release at 11:30 PM on the 15th as follows: The MMED has decided to dispatch U.S. Marine Corps aircraft to 14 cities and villages in the provinces of Suiyuan, Rehe, and Hebei on the 16th to distribute the order to cease conflict in order to stop the local conflicts that are still taking place in various places. The above order was also dropped in Chifeng, Rehe Province, this morning. According to reports from the government army, conflicts are still taking place in Nanxiangyu in the southwest area of Gubeikou, and in Zhuozishan, Jining, Fengzhen, Gui Sui, Wuchuan, and Helin in Suiyuan Province. It was decided on the morning of the 16th to send planes to the above-mentioned places to drop the order to cease conflict. Gui Sui is the location of the government army's garrison headquarters in Suiyuan Province, while the Communist army is stationed in Jining, Fengzhen, Wuchuan, and Helin. It is reported that small-scale conflicts have also occurred. In Yongnian County in southwestern Hebei, in addition to distributing the order to cease conflict, a notice signed by the three commissioners of the MMED will also be dropped, allowing food and goods to pass through the conflict zone to relieve the famine of the local people. On the Jinpu Line, the MMED has decided to distribute the order to cease conflict in four places, namely Lianzhen, Dongguang, Botou, and Cangxian, to stop the conflict in that area. The same order will also be dropped in Yanzhou, about 80 miles south of Jinan, and Liaocheng, near the Grand Canal. In addition to sending U.S. Marine Corps aircraft to the conflict areas, the MMED commissioners announced that they would soon dispatch ceasefire execution teams to the conflict areas to contact the commanders of the troops in each area, investigate the actual situation, and report to the headquarters.

### The Northeast Headquarters Will Move Back to Changchun; Shenyang Citizens Welcome the National Army

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] The situation in the Northeast is gradually improving. The Northeast Headquarters, which was originally planned to move from Beiping to Jinzhou, is now planned to move back to Changchun. Our army is scheduled to enter Shenyang today. Xiong Shihui plans to go to inspect the situation with the army and return to Beiping around the 20th. Madame Chiang will definitely fly to Changchun with Chiang Ching-kuo recently. The welcoming arrangements in Changchun are being jointly prepared by the Chinese and Soviet sides. Gao Xibing, chairman of Andong and Dalian, who is anxious about the lack of news, may go to Changchun recently to seek a solution as soon as possible. Mayor Shen Yi of Dalian is still touring Qingdao and has not returned. It is thought that he is using the free time before the Dalian issue is decided to observe the Qingdao municipal administration as much as possible for reference for Dalian's administration. Wu Yanzhang, chairman of Xing'an, said to our reporter today that his trip had been postponed again and again because heavy snow in the Northeast prevented the plane from landing. He joked, "If you see the newspaper, I have already flown to Changchun four or five days ago."

[United Press, Chongqing, 16th] Jiang Ching-kuo, the Northeast Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, paid a visit to Chairman Chiang yesterday and will fly to Beiping and then to Changchun in the Northeast within days.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 15th] The National Army entered Shenyang at 3:30 PM today. The citizens gathered at the Huanggu Village Railway Station to welcome them. The whole city was decorated with flags, and the enthusiastic scene was unprecedented.

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 16th] The troops of the National Army who are going to Shenyang to take over defense have arrived in three trains on the 15th. The third train arrived safely on the morning of the 16th, and the fourth train also set off from Jinzhou and is expected to arrive in the afternoon of the 16th.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 14th] Air transport was strengthened today compared to the previous day, and another batch of soldiers arrived. In addition, Chen Tao from the Ministry of Military Administration, Pan Zhonglu from the Central News Agency, and 30 other personnel for the takeover arrived.

[Central News Agency, Harbin, 14th] After the establishment of the Songjiang Provincial Government, the various takeover works proceeded smoothly. Regarding the takeover of the counties, Shuangcheng, the first county of Songjiang, was taken over first with the assistance of the Soviet side. Fu Yuncheng, the county magistrate of the county, and Yang Zhishi, the director of the police bureau, officially took over the county administration today. As for the other 20 counties, they will be taken over gradually.

### Premier Song Has Drafted a Whole Plan to Relieve the Housing Shortage in the Recovered Areas

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Chongqing News: After Premier Song Ziwen returned to Chongqing, he reported the general serious housing shortage in the recovered areas to Chairman Chiang. He was approved by the Chairman to borrow 800 million yuan from the Four Banks to the Nanjing Municipal Government for construction purposes. The Nanjing Municipal Engineering Bureau is stepping up the design and construction. It is heard that Premier Song has recently drafted a whole plan to relieve the housing shortage in the recovered areas. The loan method will slightly imitate Nanjing, and the areas will include major cities such as Shanghai, Hankou, Guangdong, Guangxi, Liuzhou, Wuzhou, Changsha, Tianjin, Beiping, Jinan, Taiyuan, Xuzhou, and Zhengzhou. The measures will be announced soon.

### The Communist Army's Unceasing Attacks on Lin and Zao

[Special Dispatch from our Xuzhou Office, 16th] As of midnight on the 15th, the Communist army surrounding Zaozhuang and Lincheng has not ceased its offensive. The entire Lin-Zao branch line of the Jinpu Railway is filled with the sound of artillery fire. Before the ceasefire deadline, the Communist army, which had been driven out of the coal mines by the National Army, has, after reinforcements, once again approached the mines. The mine police guarding the mine shafts have suffered almost complete casualties. The miners and their families are now using all sorts of heavy weapons to fight a desperate battle against the Communist army. The National Army originally assisting in the defense of the Zaozhuang coal mines is very small in number and strictly adheres to the ceasefire order, taking no active actions. Witnessing the indiscriminate slaughter of hundreds of innocent miners' families by the rampaging Communist army, they are burning with anger but unable to disobey orders and engage in combat. Many are weeping bitterly and cursing the Communist Party for its utter lack of conscience. On the night of the 14th, they repeatedly requested their superiors to allow them to resign from their military posts, wishing to fight the Communist army as civilians. The unit commander of the National Army firmly refused, tearfully explaining the greater good. Last night, north of Xuzhou, the north wind howled and water froze into ice. The National Army there was unprepared for war, and most of the field hospitals had been closed. As a result, the injured soldiers and civilians carried from Lincheng and Zaozhuang bled onto their stretchers, and the dripping blood froze into ice, the ice shavings falling to the ground, a horrific scene of red and white intermingling. A former teacher at a miners' children's school, lying on a stretcher, cried out miserably, "The Communist Party is so cruel! Please, reporters from Chongqing, Nanjing, and Shanghai, come and see this hell on earth!"

### Rumor: Fu Zuoyi's Four Resignations Were Not Approved

[Dispatch from our Nanjing Office, 16th] A person from Chongqing said: It is rumored that Fu Zuoyi has resigned four times from his position as Commander-in-Chief of the Twelfth War Zone and Chairman of Suiyuan Province, but his resignations have not been approved. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek even offered him warm words of comfort. Allied generals and reporters stationed in China have great respect for Fu. Last autumn, after General Wedemeyer inspected Fu's troops from western Suiyuan and returned to Chongqing, he praised Fu as a rare and outstanding general. The rumor that Fu intended to resign because the Communist Party demanded his dismissal from his military post is inaccurate.

### Guangdong Executes Female Spy

(Dispatch from United Press, Guangzhou, 16th) Huang Meili (female, transliteration), accused of collaborating with the Japanese and acting as a spy, was executed yesterday. She was 25 years old and lived in Japan as a child. After the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou, she married a Japanese man and was accused of collecting military intelligence about China for the Japanese.

### News Briefs

Dispatch from our Kunming Office: The China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Kunming-Guangzhou passenger plane service has been reduced to one flight per week, starting from the 14th, due to a shortage of pilots. The company also has several planes in India that will be flown to Kunming for use soon.

Dispatch from Chongqing: The newly appointed French Ambassador, Mr. Meyrier, presented his credentials to the National Government today. The ceremony was held in the Auditorium, so the Political Consultative Conference was rescheduled to 3:00 PM. The topic of discussion was the National Assembly.

### Sun Yueqi, Responsible for Receiving Northeast Industry and Mining, Flies to Changchun with Experts - Agreement Reached in Moscow Negotiations

[Dispatch from our Beiping Office, 15th] Sun Yueqi, responsible for receiving industry and mining, returned to Beiping from Chongqing by special plane on the 14th, accompanied by more than 20 experts. Sun will fly to Changchun tomorrow morning to negotiate the handover of industrial and mining affairs. According to well-informed sources, in the Sino-Soviet negotiations in Moscow, an agreement seems to have been reached on industrial and mining issues. China will jointly operate several factories and mines with the Soviet Union. Chiang Ching-kuo's trip to Moscow seems to have been quite successful.

[Dispatch from our Beiping Office, 15th] The Northeast industrial and mining issue shows clear signs of resolution. Amidst rumors of Chiang Ching-kuo's return to Chongqing, the highest authorities summoned Sun Yueqi, responsible for receiving industrial and mining, to Chongqing by long-distance telephone on the 10th. Sun flew to Chongqing on the 11th for instructions. Today, Sun sent a telegram here stating that he would fly north by special plane today, stay overnight in Beiping, and fly to Changchun on the 16th to receive Northeast industrial and mining. He has also designated Hu Ankai, Xu Yingqi, Ma Shiliang, Sun Wenzao, Ji Jimin, Yang Zhiping, Tao Yongming, Du Chunyan, Yu Changju, and Yang Yunzhi, ten experts in Beiping, to accompany him. Currently, the handover of Northeast industry and mining has begun partially, with Soviet personnel accompanying them. It is understood that not many of the key factory and mine machinery and equipment in the Northeast have been shipped abroad. Some lost machinery is still within Northeast China, and under certain circumstances, this machinery is expected to return to its posts and work. The detailed results of Chiang Ching-kuo's negotiations with the Soviets on industry and mining are still unknown here as of the time of this dispatch. It is generally believed that the Soviet side may participate in several factories and mines in the Northeast with its technology and capital.

[Dispatch from United Press, Jinzhou, 15th] The slow progress of the National Army in receiving various areas in the nine eastern provinces indicates that the negotiations between Zhang Jia'ao, Special Economic Envoy for the Northeast, and Malinovsky in Changchun are of utmost importance. The crux of the negotiations seems to be the formulation of detailed measures for Soviet participation in various undertakings in the nine eastern provinces. To date, the authorities have not indicated that Soviet troops will remain in the nine eastern provinces beyond February 1. The Chinese authorities still assume that the handover can be completed after that month, but according to most observers here, Malinovsky's forces may not be able to complete their withdrawal within the next eighteen days. There are various reasons for this speculation; some believe that winter weather is not conducive to troop movements, while others claim that the Soviet side has not obtained sufficient coal on the Changchun Railway to run trains. However, the most compelling reason is that several key points in the Sino-Soviet economic negotiations have not yet been resolved. The United Press reporter has learned the nature of the key points in the negotiations from the most reliable sources here, but the Soviet side has not confirmed these claims. First, the Soviet Union has requested to obtain commercial airports in major cities in the nine eastern provinces, such as Harbin, Changchun, and Shenyang, to connect with the free port of Dalian and the naval base of Lushun. They also plan to lay telephone lines from Manzhouli on the Sino-Soviet border directly to Dalian. Second, it is rumored that the Soviet Union is demanding joint control of half of the heavy industry in the nine eastern provinces, including coal and iron. Third, the Soviets, having purchased assets from the Japanese, intend to continue to retain ownership of them on Chinese territory. The Chinese side has not yet given a definite answer to the above points. Zhang Jia'ao's position, approved by the central government, is reportedly that any matter involving Soviet interests should be based on the rights and interests Russia held in Manchuria before the Russo-Japanese War forty-one years ago as a basis for negotiation. Briefly, this refers to the ownership of the Chinese Eastern Railway, navigation rights on the Songhua River, land purchase rights in the railway zone, mining and logging rights, the right to install and operate telephone and telegraph lines, postal and judicial rights, exemption from taxes to the Chinese government, and the management rights of the railway zone. However, it is rumored that Malinovsky's position is that Japan established heavy industry in the nine eastern provinces in preparation for war with the Soviet Union and the United Nations, so as a result of the war, the Soviet Union has the right to take the industry in the nine eastern provinces as war spoils. According to authoritative sources, this point is still under discussion among the four major powers. There are many rumors about the systematic removal of heavy industrial equipment and machinery. Some believe that the Soviet Union will still return the factory equipment, but only on the condition that the Soviet Union has a say in the operation of the factories. However, many rumors are just hearsay. The Chinese side has not had the opportunity to thoroughly inspect most of the industries in the nine eastern provinces. Only after complete control of the nine eastern provinces can the extent of industrial damage be assessed. According to Chinese officials, the extent of the demolition of flour and textile mills in Jinzhou is not as severe as initially reported, so the reports from other industrial areas in the nine eastern provinces cannot be fully believed. A definitive conclusion can only be reached after a thorough inspection of the major coal, iron mines, and factories. Some rumors also say that most of the locomotives and freight trains on the railways are missing. Few locomotives and trains remain in the small area from the Great Wall to Xinmin. It is rumored that 2,000 locomotives are concentrated in a certain location near the northern border of Korea, but this claim has not been confirmed. Another rumor says that trains loaded with supplies were driven to Manzhouli in Soviet territory, but this has also not been confirmed.

### Speech by Our Representative Gu Weijun: Urges Speedy Establishment of the Trusteeship System - China Firmly Believes in the Principle of Collective Peace - Willing to Do Its Utmost to Help the United Nations Complete Its Mission

[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 16th] Dr. Gu Weijun, China's Chief Representative, following the Iranian representative yesterday, addressed the United Nations General Assembly, hoping that the Trusteeship Committee would be established without delay. He said that the Trusteeship System is a significant improvement over the Mandate System, and tens of millions of people will benefit from it. The Trusteeship System can accelerate the political, economic, social, and educational development of the people in the mandated territories, so that their desire to establish autonomous governments and achieve independence can be realized soon. China is determined to do its utmost to help the United Nations complete its mission. The Chinese people firmly believe in the principle of collective peace and are willing to subordinate their national interests to collective security. Therefore, they know that the United Nations cannot and will not fail. The five committees recommended by the Preparatory Committee to be established by the Economic and Social Council, of which the Human Rights Committee is of paramount importance, are a good start. The United Nations should take as its main principle the encouragement and respect for the rights and freedoms of peoples, without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion, which is an event of deep interest to people around the world. Lasting peace should be premised on respect for individual dignity. Dr. Gu also expressed his gratitude for the establishment of the Narcotics Committee, as drug use has been increasing since the outbreak of the war. In every war, the enemy has pursued a policy of drug poisoning in the Far East, so drug prohibition is a matter of urgent importance.

(Dispatch from Reuters, London, 16th) Last night, at the United Nations General Assembly, as the President, Mr. Spaak, was about to adjourn after the speech of the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, he announced that the British Foreign Minister Mr. Bevin would deliver a speech at 10:30 AM on Thursday (6:30 PM Shanghai time). The Assembly will debate the report of the Preparatory Committee today. The representatives of El Salvador, Ecuador, and Norway will speak. The representatives of Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Poland will speak in the afternoon. In addition to Mr. Bevin, two others will speak on Thursday morning. The Security Council will meet on Thursday afternoon, and the Assembly will not hold a meeting. Ten people will speak on Friday, representing India, Czechoslovakia, Australia, South Africa, Venezuela, Yugoslavia, Canada, Greece, Byelorussia, Ukraine and France.

[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 16th] Foreign Secretary Bevin's speech will declare that Britain is prepared to transfer its mandated territories to the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations. However, with regard to Palestine, no decision can be made until the joint British-American Palestine Investigation Committee submits its report. Bevin will also declare the British government's opinion that Transjordan, currently under mandate, has reached the stage where it can become an independent country. According to sources in London, the Kingdom of Yemen may apply to join the United Nations next year. The Emir of Transjordan, Abdullah, may come to London next month to negotiate with the British government and the United Nations. Transjordan has not yet joined the United Nations. After its sovereignty is recognized, it may not complete the procedures for applying for membership before the end of this session of the General Assembly.

### United Nations General Assembly - Second Day of Debate - Touches on the Issues of Iran and the East Indies

[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 16th] Since the convening of the United Nations General Assembly in London last week, it was only last night that the urgency of the world's "danger spots" was deeply understood for the first time, especially in the Middle East and Asia. On the second day of the general debate at the Assembly, the representatives of Iran, China, and the Netherlands spoke. The dispute in Azerbaijan, the turmoil in Indonesia, and the threat of the atomic bomb were the most pressing concerns for the representatives. The head of the Soviet delegation, Mr. Gromyko, sat solemnly with his hand on his chin, listening to the speech of Mr. Taghizadeh, the head of the Iranian delegation, who declared that Iran reserved the right to submit the Iranian issue to the Assembly for discussion, and said that Iran, for the sake of the overall situation, had not requested that the Iranian issue be placed on the agenda of this session. However, if the issue is not resolved outside the conference hall soon, Iran may ask the Assembly to consider it. After the Iranian representative finished speaking, the applause in the hall was weak, and the applauders were not without embarrassment. After the applause subsided, the Soviet representative and the Soviet Ukrainian representative immediately discussed separately. It was seen that Mr. Manuilsky in the Soviet Ukrainian delegation shook his head and made a gesture of negation. The first to mention Indonesia was the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mr. Schermerhorn, who said that social changes had taken place in the Dutch East Indies, which were "close to a social revolution." The Dutch side is working with the people of Indonesia "with a radical attitude" to deal with the problem. The passion of the oppressed people of Asia and Europe is incomparable to that before the war. Both physically and mentally, they have felt the shameful consequences of the unrestrained brutality of the war, as if they were in hell. Therefore, these countries are eager for new political reforms. The atomic bomb issue was also raised by Schermerhorn, who said that in a short period of time, many other countries, including smaller ones, will learn the secrets of atomic energy explosion. Human evolution has reached a critical stage, and there is only a short time left to place policies on a solid foundation of humanitarian principles. Schermerhorn went on to urge the speedy establishment of a trusteeship system, saying that the Dutch delegation believes that the opinions and wishes of the people in the trust territories should be taken into account. How to "listen to the voices of these people themselves" should be one of the most important issues to be discussed. Dr. Gu Weijun, China's Chief Representative, rose to speak next, seconding the plan to establish a Trusteeship Council quickly (see speech above).

It is heard that the petitions sent from all over the world to the Secretariat of the General Assembly are as numerous as snowflakes, including four different groups, such as the Indonesian Youth Federation in India, all requesting an immediate solution to the Indonesian problem. These requests, along with the "Irish issue" and the requests of the two national assemblies of Slovakia and Armenia to each occupy a seat in the United Nations Organization, will be handled by a special subcommittee.

### Atomic Energy Weapons - For Security Purposes - Recommendation of the Chairman of the Security Council

[Dispatch from United Press, London, 15th] The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to hold its first meeting this Thursday. According to the temporary rules of the Assembly, the chairmanship will be rotated in order of the first letter of the names of the member states. Australian Minister Makin has been designated by his government as a member of the Security Council and will serve as Chairman of the first meeting.

[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 16th] Mr. Makin, the Chief Representative of Australia, who is expected to be elected as Chairman of the United Nations Security Council and is responsible for organizing the international security force, spoke yesterday, advocating that atomic energy weapons be used by the international military force to protect world peace. Mr. Makin stated that the United Nations Charter has stipulated that the military power and resources of the member states should be pooled to maintain international peace and security. When the Charter was signed, the secrets of atomic energy were little known, but the nature of atomic weapons is not incompatible with the general provisions of the Charter regarding the allocation of military power, assistance, and facilitation. Atomic energy is not only used for destruction. If it can be used for the economic and material benefit of all the people of the world, it may have significant construction power.

### Gu Weijun Attends the Security Council

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, London, 15th] Our government has appointed Ambassador to the UK Gu Weijun as our country's representative to the United Nations Security Council, and Ambassador to the Soviet Union Fu Bingchang as the deputy representative.

### Methods for Organizing International Police Force Under Consideration

[Dispatch from United Press, London, 16th] According to well-informed sources, the US military will serve as the United Nations police force, planned according to geographical distribution, so that in the event of any act of aggression, it can be dispatched to suppress it at any time. The detailed methods are being considered by the United States, pending future discussions with the Chiefs of Staff Committee of the four countries, China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France. The principles on which the United States is based are as follows: Each geographical unit should include units of equal naval and air power, the number of personnel should be determined by two factors, namely (1) what is needed to handle the event itself, (2) what is necessary to maintain the military prestige of the United Nations and the equivalent of political prestige. Regarding the latter, it probably means that the number of troops retained must be more than the military needs. Each country will allocate troops based on its resources, so the United States and Britain may supply the navy and air force, while the Soviet Union will supply the army. This US plan is subject to Congressional approval.

### Decision to Conduct Thorough Study on the Declaration of Human Rights

[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 16th] Mr. Mudaliar, the Chief Representative of India to the United Nations General Assembly, told our agency that the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations will decide on the organization of its Human Rights Committee when it convenes a meeting within days. The Cuban representative has suggested that the General Assembly discuss human rights and issue a declaration of the rights of individuals and nations, but since the task of this General Assembly is only to discuss various institutions and set up various councils, the issue of human rights does not need to be discussed in the Assembly. The issue of atomic energy, because it is too important, has been placed on the agenda of the Assembly, but the issuance of a declaration of human rights will not be postponed. The Economic and Social Council will study the matter at its first session. The issue of the human rights of men and women was already discussed at the San Francisco Conference, and the Charter has also clearly stipulated that the Economic and Social Council should establish a Human Rights Committee. The Human Rights Committee is the only committee explicitly mentioned in the Charter. It is my opinion that when the report of the Human Rights Committee to the Economic and Social Council is delivered to the General Assembly, the latter may consider issuing a declaration of human rights. It is expected that this issue can be discussed in the second phase of the General Assembly. The proper procedure would be for the General Assembly to regard the declaration as a convention and submit it to the member states for adoption.

### Two-Nation Subcommittee to Handle Requests from All Parties

[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 16th] The United Nations Standing Committee appointed China and Venezuela last night as members of a subcommittee to handle the various requests submitted to the Secretariat of the Assembly by minorities and groups around the world. The first item is the Indonesian issue, which is the request submitted by four groups, including the "Indonesian Youth Federation in India." Two Romanian groups raised the Jewish issue. The Polish General Federation and the Armenian National Committee requested to send representatives to the United Nations General Assembly.

[Dispatch from United Press, London, 15th] The United Nations General Affairs Committee announced today that it had received a telegram from the Italian government applying for membership. Soviet Representative Gromyko opposed forwarding the telegram to the Security Council. Finally, Mr. Spaak, the President of the Assembly, expressed his opinion that the application for membership telegram should be specially filed.

### Statement by Prime Minister of East Indies

[Dispatch from Reuters, Batavia, 16th] Indonesian Republic Prime Minister Sjahrir again issued a statement to the press yesterday stating that the Indonesian people are eager for a peaceful solution and hope that the United Nations General Assembly can make a decision on this matter. We have already declared independence, so any agreement, whether public or secret, that we have not participated in the negotiations, cannot have a binding effect on us.

### Application of Radio Wave Heating in American Industry - Faster than Steam Heating

[Dispatch from American News Agency, New York, 15th] According to a recent report in Wall Street Journal, the method of generating heat using radio waves, which began to be invented before the war, is now actually working in factories. A large rubber factory in Fall River, Massachusetts, has used radio wave heating to repair huge hard rubber wheels, and the new method takes only 18 minutes, while the old method using steam heating takes 5 hours. Another Midwestern candy manufacturer is also using radio wave heating to make its candy. Candy factories can use radio waves to heat peanuts to 130 degrees, while preserving their flavor. Winemakers are studying how to use radio wave heating to reduce the bottle. Because radio wave heating can pass through glass bottles without being hindered. The radio waves used for heating are similar to the short waves used in radar broadcasting. The radio waves themselves have no heat, but when the waves are blocked by a substance, the waves excite the molecular structure of the substance and release heat. Radio wave heating engineers have predicted that within five years, the number of radio wave heating equipment sold annually will reach US$150 million.

[Dispatch from United Press, Chicago, 15th] Several glass manufacturing experts announced at the American Institute of Chemical Engineers the invention of a plaster containing glass fiber, which can be used to manufacture train roofs, with greater strength than other building materials and resistant to corrosion. This glass fiber can also be used to strengthen concrete.

### President Truman Issues Statement Saying the U.S. Should Request Long-Term Control of Certain Pacific Islands from the United Nations

[Reuters, Washington, 16th] President Truman announced yesterday: The U.S. government, in view of actual needs, believes that long-term control of various islands in the Pacific region is necessary for national security. The U.S. government should request the United Nations to grant sole trusteeship. For other islands that the U.S. does not wish to retain, the U.N. should administer the trusteeship. The U.S. will maintain considerable interest, together with other allied nations, in other islands that did not previously belong to Japan. Reports from London state that the U.S. delegation attending the U.N. General Assembly has not reached a consensus on whether the Japanese islands conquered by the U.S. should be placed under the sovereignty of the U.N. Truman's statement is to clarify this matter. President Truman also stated that the specific islands necessary for U.S. security have not been definitively determined. He believes that islands within the necessary security range should be governed by the U.S. alone, under the supervision of the U.N. Security Council.

[Reuters, Washington, 16th] Newspapers report that the U.S. delegation attending the U.N. General Assembly has a draft proposal regarding the control of Pacific islands. Authoritative sources also say that the U.S. State Department is cooperating with Army and Navy officials to study plans regarding islands seized from Japan. However, State Department personnel have refused to comment on these newspaper reports, stating that it is the State Department's consistent policy not to comment on matters being handled by delegates attending international conferences. A report from London states that these drafts propose placing important islands under U.N. trusteeship, but it is necessary to reach an understanding to include these islands within the U.S. "military strategic zone."

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 15th] A subcommittee of the U.S. House Naval Affairs Committee has departed to inspect U.S. military bases in the Pacific region to determine which should be retained. The committee has arrived in Tokyo and will hold meetings with Army Commander General MacArthur and senior officials of the Allied Headquarters.

### Mrs. Roosevelt Speaks to Reporters

[Associated Press, London, 15th] Mrs. Roosevelt, President Roosevelt's widow, today hosted all the news reporters for the first time, saying that countries aligned with the Nazi party, such as Italy, should be allowed to join the U.N. organization as soon as they qualify. This issue should be decided by a special committee of the U.N. When reporters asked Mrs. Roosevelt about the rumor that former British Prime Minister Churchill might be nominated as Secretary-General, she replied that she did not believe Churchill would welcome this suggestion. She then added that she was disappointed by the small number of women attending this U.N. General Assembly. She would like to see more female representatives attend because the more women feel a direct relationship with the success or failure of an event, the more interested they will become.

### Sincere Cooperation Between the U.S. and the Soviet Union Will Ensure the Success of the New Organization: El Salvador's Representative Addresses the Assembly

[Reuters, London, 16th] At this morning's meeting of the U.N. organization General Assembly, the Salvadoran Ambassador Plenipotentiary, the head of the country's delegation, Mr. Grallero, delivered a speech, the main points of which were: With the participation of the United States and the Soviet Union, humanity can hope that the establishment of lasting peace by the U.N. organization will be successful. The League of Nations in 1920 was different because these two powerful nations did not participate. This morning was a gathering of Latin American nations. Representatives from Ecuador, Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico are all prepared to present their respective countries' views to the General Assembly. Grallero, speaking in fluent French, said that he had participated in the work of the first General Assembly of the League of Nations in 1920 and is now attending the first General Assembly of the United Nations, which is truly rare. After 25 years, well-intentioned people have gathered again with the same hope. Their efforts in 1920 were unfortunately unsuccessful. Now they are regrouping and trying again to maintain humanity and prevent the scourge of war. Recalling the events of 1920, he cannot forget the spirit of trust and hope that he held when the first General Assembly of the League of Nations began its work. The original charter was not perfect, which is a fact, because the general intentions of its original authors had changed significantly when it was drafted. However, the necessary principles of upholding international morality are inscribed in the preface to the charter, which has always been the foundation for people to enjoy harmonious life. The initial charter sought the union of nations, intending to guarantee the political independence and territorial integrity of all countries. Its member states guaranteed that they would conduct international relations openly, based on justice and honor, strictly abide by the principles of international law, and respect treaty obligations, thereby reassuring the people and guaranteeing their future security. What promise could be better than this? However, as everyone knows, the evolution of the situation, the activities of evil forces, and the weakness of humanity failed to contain it. As a result, the charter, whether in spirit or in letter, was not implemented, and from that time on, the fate of the League of Nations was decided. However, great progress was made within the scope of international law, which was an achievement of the League of Nations. The work completed by the Permanent Court of International Justice it established has influenced the conscience of various countries. Now, the United Nations organization brings new hope to the world. The two most powerful countries in the world, which did not attend the 1920 General Assembly, are now here, prepared to cooperate in safeguarding peace. These two countries are the United States, to which all the people of the American hemisphere closely adhere, and the Soviet Union, which guarantees that international stable order must be linked.

### Eisenhower Reports on the Situation of U.S. Troop Demobilization

[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower attended an informal congressional meeting today, reporting on the situation of U.S. troop demobilization, stating that every soldier who has 45 points or has served for 30 months can be discharged on April 30th. Those with 40 points or who have served for two years can be discharged on July 1st. Unnecessary soldiers can be discharged immediately, except for those who have served for too short a period. Eisenhower also compared the Army's occupation forces to firefighters, saying that firefighters may sometimes be seen playing and doing nothing, but they are not dismissed and sent home because there may be a time in the future when they are needed urgently. The same is true of our occupation forces; they must be maintained at a safe level, because even if it is not possible to have everyone working every day, there may be a time in the future when they are needed. The order that those who have served for 30 months will be discharged means that 2.2 million people can be demobilized by the end of April, of which 500,000 are in the Pacific region. By July 1st, another 500,000 people will be demobilized, at which time the total remaining force will be 1.5 million people. However, too rapid demobilization will cause the army's organization to "collapse." Subsequently, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Nimitz reported that the Navy's demobilization is still proceeding according to the original plan.

### British Army Agrees on Whether Soviet Troops Will Be Stationed in Japan Is Undecided

[Reuters, Washington, 16th] Undersecretary of State Acheson confirmed that Britain has agreed to have an Australian general lead a unit of the British Commonwealth to be stationed in Japan. British troops may not be able to go to Japan until two or three months later. The State Department has not yet received a reply on whether the Soviet Union also intends to send troops to be stationed in Japan. The Soviet government has not yet indicated whether it is willing to have the Red Army placed under MacArthur's command.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 16th] MacArthur's headquarters today notified the Japanese government that any existing or old aeronautical research equipment is not allowed to be used or moved without authorization from headquarters.

Tanjin: Supervising Japanese Prisoners of War to Repair Highways: Tanjin is located at the intersection of the Jinwu Highway and the Zhendan Jinpiao Highway. After the victory, it was occupied by bandits, and the highway bridges were all destroyed, causing traffic to come to a standstill. Now, under the supervision of the Highway Administration, Japanese prisoners of war are stepping up repairs. In addition to the Jinwu section (Wujin to Jintan), which has already been repaired, the Danjin section will also be completed within a specified period, and traffic will be restored to both sections within a month.

Nanchang: Relief for Rural Areas After the Disaster in Nanchang: Before the War of Resistance, the rural areas around Nanchang were already bankrupt. During the war, the Japanese invaders targeted the destruction of rural areas, burning and plundering everywhere. Of the 83 counties in Jiangxi, only 15, including Guangze, were not poisoned. The remaining 60 counties were all ravaged. The most severely affected were Nanchang, Gao'an, De'an, and Xinjian counties. In the third and fifth districts of Nanchang County, all villages and houses were completely burned down. Now, the displaced refugees are returning one after another, and problems have arisen with food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. Zhang Guo, the director of the Jiangxi Good Relief Sub-Office, except for Nanchang, which is directly handled by the sub-office, the rest are the responsibility of the itinerant work team. Regarding the economy, the operating expenses for the recent three months were 140,000,000 yuan.

### Rome Has Turned into a Beggar City: It is estimated that there are 150,000 Impoverished Refugees. After the Allied Forces Left, the Music of Accordions Also Disappeared

[Associated Press, Rome, 15th] Rome has always been known as the "Eternal City." Even the art of begging is different from other places, always with some musical atmosphere. But now the situation has changed. No more music is heard, only the true appearance of beggars can be seen, with tattered clothes, dirty bodies, rotten sores and diseases, reaching out their hands to ask for money. According to the city government's statistics, there are 20,000 beggars in the city. Many of them are engaged in begging as a profession. It is estimated that there are 150,000 impoverished people. A few months ago, there were hundreds of flute players from the mountains and many ragged men and women and children playing accordions in the beggar groups. When the Allied forces first arrived in Rome, it was a great way to beg. British and American soldiers would generously donate lira notes at any time. Now that the large army has left, the music of the beggars has also disappeared. The few soldiers left in Rome see outstretched palms every day, and their hearts have hardened. A few months ago, a beggar earned hundreds of stars (lira) every day, which was not uncommon. Sometimes, they could even earn a thousand lira a day. Now, they cannot earn that much. An old woman, dressed well, looking like an impoverished aristocrat, still begs only on Fifth Avenue. Six months ago, she told benefactors about the Dharma. Now she speaks Italian, but most of the beggars in the city, such as women with disheveled hair and dirty faces, leading sick-looking children, continue to beg back and forth on the streets of Rome. Because it is too cold, they can no longer sit still for hours. Those beggars who are used to pretending to be silently grieving and in need of relief have mostly abandoned their posts. To foreigners, they mostly say in Italian: "Sir, please give us something." However, the most effective way to say it is an old man standing there, only shouting, "Starved to death, starved to death!"

### U.S. and Soviet Representatives Negotiate the Korean Issue in Seoul, the Trusteeship Period Will Be Shortened

[Associated Press, Seoul, 16th] In accordance with the agreement of the Moscow Conference of the Three Foreign Ministers, the United States and the Soviet Union held a joint conference in Seoul. The Soviet delegation of 73 people arrived here by train from the Soviet-occupied area of ​​northern Korea in heavy snow today, and will work with the US delegation to revitalize Korea, so that 30 million Koreans who have just been liberated after 40 years of Japanese rule can restore their independence. US Major General Arnold personally went to Seoul Station to welcome them, and immediately accompanied Soviet Representative Lieutenant General Schtikoff and others to the Korean Hotel. Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US military in the southern occupied area, then drove to visit him. In the afternoon, the officers of both parties first consulted to formulate the agenda. Tomorrow, the leaders of the two countries will hold a meeting at the Governor’s Office of Japan’s rule in Korea. According to Lieutenant General Hodge, because the Soviet representative proposed, the conference news will be released in a joint communique. The two occupied areas are bordered by the 38th parallel, so this artificial division has greatly increased economic problems. Both sides have specialized advisors, and the lineup is neat. Generally speaking, northern Korea is an industrial area and southern Korea is an agricultural area. According to the decision of the Moscow Conference, the first task should be to restore the economic foundation of Korea, and then discuss political issues. [United Press International, Washington, 16th] Officials from all walks of life here welcomed the State Department's announcement that the commanders of the US and Soviet occupation forces in Korea would meet soon. It is considered a good sign to reduce the boundaries within Korea. The general public is quite optimistic about the possibility that the first formal meeting between the US and the Soviet Union will enable the Joint Committee stipulated in the Moscow Conference to be established soon, and to adjust the administrative and economic affairs of the North and South as soon as possible. People close to the State Department said: At present, there is sufficient reason to believe that the plan to shorten the time limit in the Moscow communiqué stipulates that the United Nations trusteeship of Korea will be five years, and its term may be considerably shortened.

### Humility, Harmony, Pleasure, Perfection: A Sketch of the Second Consultation Conference of the Eastern-Style Grand Assembly

— This newspaper’s Chongqing, 13th, Airmail News: By Pu De, out of touch with the times

The second meeting of the Political Consultative Conference was held at the National Government Auditorium at 9:00 am on the 12th. Zhang Lan was absent due to illness, and Wang Xueting was late due to business. A total of 35 people attended, and President Sun Zhesheng continued to act as chairman.

The meeting began: Under the warm winter sunshine, the atmosphere was exceptionally harmonious. First, according to the agenda decided yesterday, both the government and the Communist Party reported on the origin of the Double Tenth Talks record.

Shao Lizi is Humble and Admirable

Mr. Shao Lizi modestly let Mr. Zhou Enlai start first. The atmosphere of courtesy kept the meeting harmonious from beginning to end.

The reporter sitting in the audience also lost the uneasy apprehension of the second half of yesterday's meeting.

Zhou Enlai Eloquent and Moving

Zhou Enlai first said a few polite words, thanking the secretariat for letting him speak first. Then, he eloquently recounted the past eight years of negotiations between the two parties. He emphasized that "eight years ago, it was to stop the civil war and unite to resist Japan, and now it is to stop the civil war and build the country peacefully." Mr. Zhou Enlai's sincere tone and attitude won the praise of the whole audience. He naturally made people forget some unpleasant facts, so that this harmonious atmosphere could be maintained consistently.

The Communist Party's Sense of Security

Then, Shao Lizi added that he emphasized the sincerity of the two parties in negotiating, but also pointed out that there had been times in the past when the two parties held their own positions, causing the meeting to be interrupted several times. He announced that a negotiation record had been erased, because this time—the cessation of the conflict was due to the Communist Party's "sense of security" and no agreement had been reached. This is also the only reason why the conflict continued to exist and expand after the Double Tenth Agreement. Mr. Shao also politely said that this meeting should be attributed to Mr. Zhang Wenbai, who is currently busy with another negotiation. He made the greatest efforts and had the best achievements.

Sun Zhesheng Announces a Break

After the two parties finished reporting, the chairman announced a 15-minute break. During the break, next to the stove, there were piles of casual talk and laughter. People like Hitler would never believe that this was next to a conference table, especially in the National Government.

Wang Yunwu Enters a Separate Room

At this time, Wang Yunwu, Chen Lifu, Chen Qitian, Zhang Junmai, Liang Shuming, and a group of five people entered a separate room to negotiate the candidates for the military investigation team.

After the break (passed the report on accepting Zhang Qun and Zhou Enlai's negotiations on ceasing military conflict and restoring traffic) Shao Congen and Yu Jiaju successively spoke, saying: The negotiations have been held in a state of continuous progress, which is quite gratifying. At this time, Ye Jianying, who was about to go to Peiping to participate in the implementation of the tripartite consultation results, bid farewell to everyone.

Deng Yingchao Does Not Forget Women's Rights

Deng Yingchao then spoke, saying: Representatives of the annual investigation team should have female participation. At this time, everyone was chatting and laughing, as there were no formal matters to discuss. Finally, Mr. Wang Yunwu and other five people re-entered the venue. After the chairman took the list from Mr. Wang, he submitted it to the meeting for opinions. As a result, everyone unanimously agreed, and the meeting ended happily and perfectly.

This three-hour second meeting was indeed truly delightful. If yesterday's meeting was Western-style, today's meeting can be said to be purely Eastern-style. After all, China is a country of courtesy.

### American General Serving to Revive China: Chennault in Chongqing to Inspect China's Business Transportation by Air

[Compiled by Our Newsroom] This reporter was honored to be present at a press conference at General Randall's residence on the 15th, where I saw Lieutenant General Chennault, who had a resolute face and youthful spirit. This is Chennault's second visit to China, which can also be said to be a return to familiar ground. His mood was exceptionally warm and cordial, making the reporters feel very comfortable with him.

As soon as we sat down next to Lieutenant General Chennault, we began to raise the questions that were on the minds of the reporters, mainly two points: one was about the new developments in the American commercial aviation industry in the Pacific, and the other was about their personal work plans in China.

Regarding the first question, Chennault told the reporters, "American aircraft manufacturing is becoming more and more innovative every day. As far as I know, aircraft that are more than twice as fast as the B-29 have already been successfully created."

Flying Time Will Be Shortened

"Two weeks ago, I flew across the Pacific, and it only took me fifty-six hours!" He couldn't hide his joy, and at the same time, he adopted a very lighthearted posture, as if he were re-enjoying this kind of pleasure in the high sky.

In his opinion, the American side has decided that by the end of this year, at the latest, the flying time across the Pacific will definitely be shortened to an astonishing degree. At that time, it will definitely be reduced to thirty-six hours due to the use of a high-speed aircraft that has already been successfully tested.

He also made a prediction (and said with conviction): By the end of March, Xunmei Airlines will resume commercial flights across the Pacific. He also said that other airlines also have news of launching similar routes, which may be implemented by the end of June.

Lieutenant General Chennault has a keen interest in Chinese affairs. In addition to expressing his willingness to work in China, he also mentioned concrete views on the ongoing Political Consultative Conference and other aspects, which can be seen in the reports of the US Information Service, saving me a little ink. The general idea of what he said that day was as follows: "My visit to China this time is prompted by my personal desire to investigate China's commercial and transportation situation."

Lieutenant General Chennault then emphasized that his return to China "is indeed a private matter" and has no official connection with the Chinese and American governments. His interest lies only in investigating the whole of China to see if he can still be of service in the work of China's revival. Because for the past eight years, his work has been in the area of destruction.

Estimated Duration of Three Months: "My visit to China this time does not represent any American company or organization, but after I complete my investigation, it may be helpful to some American business organizations." He expects the scope of this investigation to include possible commercial developments, the current commercial situation, and the aviation transportation situation. The required time will be three months.

He is determined to investigate the Chinese valleys south of Beiping and has no intention of going to North China or the Northeast Provinces for the time being. However, if there is an opportunity, he would very much like to investigate the North in March.

Lieutenant General Chennault retired from the Army on October 31 last year and is still wearing his Army Air Corps uniform. When he left China to return to the United States, it was only two days before the first atomic bomb fell on Hiroshima. He said that at that time, the Fourteenth Air Force had completed its mission in China.

Lieutenant General Chennault then discussed the current transportation problems, the urgent need to develop the agricultural economy, and the damage to roads and rivers. He said that it will take considerable time to solve the various problems. And this work is very difficult. In order to help China, he believes that he would rather take on peacetime tasks than bear military responsibilities. As for his future plans, it all depends on the results of his investigation of China's trade situation in peacetime.

Recognizes Consultative Conference as a Good Opportunity for Unification

Now, he is meeting with his military and business friends in Chongqing. As soon as he arrived in Chongqing, he had dinner with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on the same day. He said that Chiang is a personal friend of his. He also said, "We did not discuss official business. I am very happy for the Chairman's happiness. I congratulate him on his current work to complete the unification of China!"

Next, Lieutenant General Chennault expressed his personal views. He believes that the current Political Consultative Conference "is indeed a good opportunity on the right path to achieve unification. China is necessary to be able to take on the task of a world power."

He also said that the American people "are very concerned about China, but they still lack a full understanding of the Chinese situation."

Lieutenant General Chennault is scheduled to go to Kunming the day after tomorrow (the 18th), then return to Chongqing, and then set off on a trip to investigate the situation in various places. At that time, he will be accompanied by an interpreter. Now, the US Air Transport Command, the Chinese Air Force Transport Command, and China National Aviation Corporation have all expressed their willingness to provide aircraft for his travel.

US Marines Visit Chinese Stage: After the arrival of the US military in North China, in order to express welcome, China continuously performed dramas on the Beiping stage for several days to thank the US Marines who arrived in the ancient capital to receive Japanese equipment, disarm the Japanese military, and send Japanese soldiers back to their country. The image shows: US Marines enter the backstage to see how Chinese Peking opera actors put on makeup.

### Will "Big Bear" Be Unbeatable in the World in Twenty-Five Years? New Prediction of Soviet Strength

— Original Article Published in American Common Sense Magazine, Translated by Our Newsroom

In the buzzing sound of hundreds of computers, the future strength of the Soviet Union is being estimated and calculated. According to the most precise population estimates, in twenty-five years, in terms of population, the strength of the Soviet Union will surpass any political group of countries in Europe.

Although all countries have guns and ammunition, the victory or defeat of modern warfare is determined by a large number of troops. When financial and material resources are exhausted, the country with the largest population has a great advantage. The Soviet Union knows this best. The Soviet Union suffered greater losses in this war than any other country in Europe, but it was still able to fight the enemy to the end with frontline units. The Soviet Union will continue to increase its population at an extraordinary rate in the next generation, while the population of other European countries will remain stagnant. At present, the population of Western and Northern Europe is decreasing, and it is expected that this decrease will continue. Even before the war, there were no signs of population growth there. The average rate of population decline in Denmark, Finland, Hungary, and Scotland is 10%, in Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Latvia, Norway, and Switzerland is between 10% and 20%, and in Sweden, the United Kingdom, Germany before Hitler's rule, and Austria, is over 20%.

Soviet Population Will Increase to 250 Million in Twenty-Five Years

According to a recent report by the de Gaulle government, if the French population continues to decline at the current rate, it will decrease from the current 40 million to 25 million by the end of this century. According to population experts, in fifty years, the French population will decrease by 7 to 8 million.

Excluding the Soviet Union, the future is brighter for the entire Europe. Setting aside the impact of the war, by 1970, the population of Europe should increase by 18 million. In other words, the total population in 1940 was 399 million, and it will increase to 417 million by 1970. But almost all of these population increases are in countries such as Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia.

Whether population trends can be changed by policies is a question that must be raised. Although the Nazi Party used prizes, loans, and so-called patriotic enthusiasm to encourage childbirth, it did not succeed in raising Germany's birth rate. Countries that are unwilling to confine women to the home to be solely responsible for childbirth will probably encounter even greater difficulties in this regard.

Compared with other parts of Europe, the Soviet population clearly has a straight upward trend and shows signs of continued growth. Since 1900, the Soviet population has increased by 55%, including the 26 million people lost in World War I and the Communist Revolution. According to statisticians, although the Soviet Union's war losses were very large, the Soviet population will increase from 174 million in 1940 to 251 million in 1970. This increase alone will be greater than the entire population of Germany in twenty-five years. By that time, the Soviet population will be 26 million more than the entire population of Western and Northern Europe!

In estimating the strength of a country, the number of population is measured by the number of army divisions, not by the total population of the country. Although the elderly and women can be driven to join the battle in the final stages, the decisive factor in the victory or defeat of a war is the young people aged fifteen to thirty-four. This is unanimously recognized by all military leaders. Therefore, when estimating the strength of European countries in the next generation, the age of the population must also be taken into account.

The Number of Young People in the Soviet Union is Equal to the Total of England, France, Germany, and Italy

In this respect, we find that the Soviet Union still occupies the primary position. Since 1900, the Soviet Union has continued to supplement the ranks of the Red Army with 6 million young people of conscription age, while Germany has only supplemented 200,000 young soldiers. This means that the Soviet Union has increased by 400 divisions of troops, while Germany has only increased by 12 divisions. In the future, the military-age manpower of the Soviet Union will become more abundant. According to estimates by Princeton University population expert Kirk, by 1970, the number of military-age young people in the Soviet Union will increase by 13 million. This increase alone is already larger than all the young troops in Germany within the borders of 1937. Kirk also predicted: "In 1970, the number of young people aged fifteen to thirty-four in the Soviet Union will be equal to the sum of all the same young people in England, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and Romania. These countries are all the most densely populated countries in Europe."

Even if the Soviet Union's war losses are taken into account, the situation will not change much, because in other parts of Europe, the war losses are almost equally significant. Some military experts have determined that after the war tends to be mechanized, the difference in population is relatively unimportant. A small number of people with sufficient equipment can rival a large number of people with incomplete weapons. After this war, these theories can no longer be established. People really cannot attack tanks and planes with bare hands, but as long as there is a minimum of technological progress, the majority of the population will show its strength. The population that can supply unlimited resources can make up for the lack of equipment.

The Soviet Union has made rapid progress in technology during this war. In another twenty-five years, the Soviet Union's military equipment will undoubtedly be on par with any country in the world. The Soviet Union's recent announcement that all young people in the country will receive extensive compulsory military training in the coming years is even more worthy of credence.

The increase or decrease in population seems to be closely related to technological progress. When mechanical engineering was introduced, the population increased accordingly. This is mostly due to improved hygiene, medical progress, and reduced mortality.

If the Soviet Union follows the population pattern of the past few centuries, it will take a long time to reach the point where the population begins to decrease. By that time, the Soviet population may be equal to or even greater than the total population of the rest of Europe.

The Strength of Future Countries Depends on the Degree of Industrialization

However, we must know that the Soviet Union is also adjacent to densely populated Asia. If we do not keep this fact in mind, we cannot consider the Soviet population in relation to Europe and get the whole picture.

In the countries of the East, if the experts' estimates are correct, we will see some significant population increases that will affect the balance of power in the entire world. This region, with the exception of Japan, has been relatively unaffected by the Western industrial revolution. India, under British rule, has slightly trended towards industrialization, which is reflected in the population increase. However, the countries of the East now seem to be ready to accept Western mechanical civilization, and it will not be long before the increase in population will break the records in human history. Just looking at the progress India has made in the past forty years, we can imagine its future development. In the past forty years, India's population has increased from 284 million to the current 388 million. Japan's progress is manifested in short-term industrialization and the accompanying increase in population. In 1870, Japan's population was 35 million. By 1940, this number had doubled. The last population survey showed a population of 75.1 million. After the outbreak of the war, this rapid population increase did not stop.

Looking at the Asian continent, based on the population growth in the past ten years, China's population will increase from the current 400 million to 609 million in 1990. During the same period, India's population will increase from 388 million to 701 million. These figures are alarming, but they are all based on the population growth rate in the past. If Asia can fully implement industrialization, then the population growth rate may be even greater. If the population of China and India increases as fast as Japan, then in fifty years, the population of China and Southeast Asia may be equal to the total population of the world today.

Even if we estimate based on the past population growth rate, when the Soviet Union's population increases to 328 million in 1990, the population of China and Southeast Asia will be 1.678 billion. This means that in fifty years, the Soviet Union's population will be exceeded by the countries of the East by a ratio of five to one. However, this prediction of population increase is based on the premise that the countries of the East are industrialized. As for the strength of their national power, it must be determined by the degree of industrialization. But one thing is certain: once the situation in Europe is stabilized, the Soviet Union's attention will shift to the East. Judging from the results of the population estimates, that is inevitable. But one thing is certain: once the situation is stabilized, the Soviet Union's attention will shift to the East. Judging from the results of the population estimates, that is inevitable.

### Hitler Needs a Mistress, the Mistress Needs a Dog

Speaking of which, Hitler really deserved what he got. The Eve Braun he loved was originally a bad woman.

If you don't believe it, please see: An American intelligence officer found the following passage in her diary in 1935: -

I stood outside Carlton for three hours because he was buying flowers for Shina and wanted to take her to dinner. I must see it clearly... I need to buy more sleeping pills now. At that time, at least I will be dizzy... According to Hoffman, he now has another woman, her name is Hua Ge'er, her legs... legs...

When he said he loved me, he was as serious as if he were making some kind of promise, but he never fulfilled all the promises... I just wrote him a letter... If I don't receive a reply by ten o'clock, I will decide to swallow fifteen sleeping pills and sleep forever... Li, the weather is good, I, the wife of a very important person in Germany and the world, have to sit at home, looking at the sky out the window...

"If only I could have a dog" (translated from "Time")

### The Judgment Day is Here, the Judgment is Quick

The war criminals who manufactured wars, murdered or injured the Allied forces and civilians have now bowed their heads to justice and are being judged for the crimes they deserve. Christ said: "The day of final judgment is near, repent as soon as possible!" However, time is merciless! It's too late, it's too late. Look! All peace-loving and just people in the world are silent witnesses! Are they not focusing their eyes and fingers on these war criminals? (Cartoon by Lamberd of the "Philadelphia Record")

Editorial

### Foreigners Discussing Chinese Affairs

Foreigners discussing Chinese affairs are sometimes very alarming for the country, but at other times, it inevitably feels like there's a disconnect. The New York Times recently published an article by Sir Frederick Whyte, titled "The Challenge to the West from the East." In it, regarding the situation in China, he stated: "I maintain that if the United Nations, especially the United States, can agree to allow the Chinese people to decide their own government according to the path unique to them, China will reach its own conclusions more quickly and effectively—even if it means paying the price of some bloodshed." Sir Frederick Whyte also said: "The same principle should apply to the whole of Asia today, including India." We have not yet seen the original text of Sir Frederick Whyte's remarks; however, Reuters has extracted these two points and disseminated them widely, as if the Chinese people are now eager to "challenge" the United States, which is a strange thing to say! While we should be grateful for Sir Frederick Whyte's concern for China, we feel that his arguments necessitate further discussion.

Sir Frederick Whyte's argument, according to him, is based on the perspective of Asians; he seems to be speaking on behalf of Asians, including the Chinese. However, as far as the situation in China is concerned, Sir Frederick Whyte's argument aims to subtly encourage the early withdrawal of American troops from China, which is quite different from the US's national policy. Disseminating this view in the United States is intended to influence American public opinion, thereby revising its national policy: once this is achieved, it will not only affect the national policy of the United States but also affect the development of the Far Eastern situation. Sir Frederick Whyte, as an Englishman, uses the guise of discussing Asian issues from the "Asian perspective," especially the "Chinese perspective" regarding the situation in China, in order to strengthen the power of his argument. Therefore, we Chinese people, especially when he discusses the situation in China, should express our attitude.

First, we must point out that after the victory of the War of Resistance, the Chinese people, understanding the mission of the American troops in China and the policy of the American government toward China, did not have any demand or hope for the early withdrawal of American troops. The American troops, in the spirit of allied friendship, were assisting the Chinese government in carrying out the tasks of accepting surrender and repatriating Japanese residents and prisoners of war in the Chinese war zone. The American troops taking on this mission in China was not only assisting China but also carrying out tasks related to their own interests. At least at this stage, before this mission is accomplished, the Chinese people have no demands or hopes for the withdrawal of American troops.

Second, the President of the United States has repeatedly stated that the US policy toward China is not to interfere in internal affairs but to support China in establishing a strong, unified, and democratic nation. President Truman's recent statement reiterated the US's traditional policy toward China. The efforts of General Hurley and Marshal Marshall, while implementing US policy, were seen by the Chinese people as a democratic and advanced nation assisting China in establishing a strong, unified, and democratic nation in the spirit of neighborly friendship. We feel grateful for this kindness, not resentment, and there is even less talk of demanding the early withdrawal of American troops.

The above two points are the sincere feelings of the Chinese people. But we do not deny another fact, that since the surrender of the Japanese invaders, because American troops quickly arrived at the major coastal ports of China and assisted the National Government in undertaking the task of accepting surrender, it may have hindered the plans of certain armed political groups to expand their power from the Japanese invaders, thereby creating public opinion demanding the withdrawal of American troops from China. If their plan succeeds, without American troops seeing their actions, they can do whatever they want. Even after an agreement to cease conflict, they can still break the agreement and attack, still seize cities and land, without being verified by allies. In fact, the sincere wish of the Chinese people at this time is that order and stability are the most important things, so they do not want to see political disputes. The efforts of the United States in China do not involve interference in internal affairs and have a stabilizing influence, which is quite commendable. We remember that in the early stages of the War of Resistance, these elements had already advocated that China should not be close to the United States. Later, due to changes in the international situation, they proposed the slogan of "democracy" in the hope of gaining US support. Currently, because the US is fair and their plans have failed, they have turned to anti-American rhetoric, demanding the withdrawal of American troops from China. All of this is a political conspiracy of a part of the Chinese people. If Sir Frederick Whyte considers the arguments of these people as the general intention of the Chinese people and bases his arguments on this, it is too superficial.

Even from the standpoint of world peace, if the United States does not intervene in Chinese affairs, it will cause very worrying consequences. From the British standpoint, considering the interests of Britain itself from a more distant perspective, this is also not beneficial. World War II originated from the September 18th Incident in Shenyang. Stimson's proposals did not receive the support of the West, and eventually, the sparks in the corner of Northeast China became uncontrollable. This was a mistake in British policy. Today, in the aftermath of the Axis collapse, considering the international situation, there is no room for further mistakes to affect the overall situation. Mankind should look at the big picture and not be confined to the current situation, lest future troubles be left behind. Let us think about how much unexploded gunpowder is contained in Asia today, from Turkey and Iran all the way to East Asia. The situation in Iran is already very serious, and Turkey is also threatened. We cannot allow this situation to spread. China, after a long war of resistance, has entered the stage of national reconstruction and needs the assistance of democratic countries with the same ideals for national reconstruction. The United States has sacrificed countless lives to support its policy in the Far East. Now that the war has stopped, the international order still needs to be rebuilt. In our efforts to build the country, the goodwill and support of our allies will be forever etched in the hearts of the Chinese people. In the efforts to rebuild the international order, allies must be of one mind and abandon their own opinions to jointly seek progress. In such an atomic age, the interests of the world, the interests of mankind, should far outweigh the interests of a single country. Certain words and deeds, from the perspective of a single country or from the perspective of national interests, may be beneficial; but from the perspective of the world, they may be harmful. Not only should arguments like those of Sir Frederick Whyte be treated with caution, but the Chinese themselves should also look ahead and behind when speaking, and not be limited to temporary and local views.

### Stock Market Rebounds: Many Exchange Money for Currency; Unified B Bonds See New High

Hot Red

Yesterday's market continued to be mediocre. Major players were slightly hesitant, and although retail investors made purchases, the bond market surged wildly. Those eager for quick profits returned to bonds, weakening the upward momentum. Many floating positions had to be liquidated around noon. Although banks continued to absorb, they didn't provide much help, making it difficult for high prices to last. Early morning trading was flat, with prices holding above the previous closing price for quite some time. Later, as people exchanged money for currency and sold off, supply and demand gradually became unsustainable. Around noon, with the liquidation of floating positions, the price gradually fell from 8.79 million to below 8.6 million. In the early afternoon, the price hovered around 8.6 million, then rose to above 8.7 million due to next-day settlement. Spot prices were also dragged up to around 8.65 million. The result was a slight drop of 2,000 compared to the previous close. Decorated gold was quoted at 93,000, silver at 700 yuan, and silver dollars remained around 450. The informal overnight loan rate remained stable, with supply and demand roughly equal. Interest rates ranged from about 8% to 11%.

Foreign Exchange: Yesterday, the US dollar saw eager buying for arbitrage, coupled with absorption by a certain bank, which narrowed the premium against gold from 605 yuan to 600 yuan per ten taels. It opened flat, then reached 1450 yuan due to significant bank absorption. The process was very smooth. Around noon, it slightly followed the decline in gold prices, and the market remained flat afterwards. The result was a slight drop of 6 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollar forwards rose to 475 due to Hong Kong Electric's application for currency (Old Hong Kong dollar 475 yuan against Legal Tender 10,000 yuan, equivalent to a Hong Kong exchange rate of 210.53), but remained weak. Old issues fell another 5 yuan, new issues fell 3 yuan. Australian pounds were bought at 2.5 yuan against the US dollar, and rupees at 24 fen, with a 10% markup for resale.

Government Bonds:

Yesterday, news that the Ministry of Finance would handle the principal and interest of various government bonds issued before the 30th year of the Republic held by people in recovered areas separately greatly boosted morale, and various expectations became more vivid. Class C bonds immediately broke through the 1400 yuan mark in the morning, and various sources of floating capital joined in one after another. Short sellers also urgently covered their positions. For a time, buying sentiment pervaded, and the price broke through two major levels of 1500 and 1600 yuan. After reaching a high price of 1665 yuan, some physical goods flowed out, causing a temporary pullback of 100 yuan. However, new bulls continued to join in, and at noon, the price again broke through the 1700 yuan level, reaching a new peak of 1765 yuan before slightly consolidating. The result was an increase of 500 yuan or more for Class A, B, D, and E bonds compared to the previous close. Class C bonds only rose 380 yuan due to the excessively high base price. Floating capital clearly chose cheaper options, and holders of miscellaneous bonds took advantage of the situation to raise prices, leading to this outcome.

Chinese Stocks:

Trading on the market didn't break away from old practices and still opened higher. There were also several rallies during the day, but prices were too high, and buyers were wary. Yong Yarn saw 1440 yuan, Meiya 990 yuan, Xinguang 80 yuan, Jingfu 77 yuan, Qinxing 71 yuan before gradually pulling back. At noon, there was even more panic, with almost all stocks closing at lower prices. The result was a drop of 100 yuan for Yong Yarn, 60 yuan for Meiya, 2.5 yuan for Jingfu, 2 yuan for Xinguang, and 1 yuan for Qinxing compared to the previous close. Various unpopular stocks also saw lower prices again.

Foreign Stocks:

The overall trend was influenced by Chinese stocks, rising first and then falling. In the end, the selling side prevailed. This was a natural pullback after many days of sharp rises. Yi Yarn fell steadily from 4100 yuan, Jardine Matheson from 10200 yuan, British American Tobacco from 5400 yuan, Yi Beer from 1480 yuan, Paper from 1350 yuan, Steel from 1850 yuan, and Asia from 1550 yuan. At noon closing, Yi Yarn fell 150 yuan, Yi Beer rose 50 yuan, Paper fell 100 yuan, and Jardine Matheson rose 450 yuan compared to the previous close.

### 3,000 Tons of US Cotton Arrives in Shanghai; Large Quantities of Flour Loaded for Qinhuangdao

The US ship *Rowling Cyork* (transliteration), carrying a large quantity of cotton, arrived in Shanghai from Seattle yesterday and docked at the Bailianjing Wharf. In addition to 3,000 tons of US cotton, the ship also carried 3,000 tons of relief flour, or more than 140,000 bags. After the cotton is unloaded, 3,000 tons of flour will be loaded in Shanghai, combining with the original 3,000 tons of flour, for a total of 6,000 tons to be transported to Qinhuangdao for distribution to North China and the nine eastern provinces. The *Wilfred Müller*, managed by the UK Far East Shipping Office, is also loading a large quantity of flour, 148,000 bags, and 1,000 tons of used clothing in Shanghai for transport to Qinhuangdao. In the coming days, large quantities of flour will be transported to the nine eastern provinces and Tianjin-Beijing for relief.

### Rice Market Continues to Rise, Oil Prices Pull Back Slightly

Yesterday, gains and losses were mixed in the grain market. Rice prices remained firm due to rising prices in production areas. *Jingxian* rice and *Yuan* rice both continued to rise by 200-300 yuan, but the market showed signs of fatigue at the close. Flour remained stable, with a slight increase of 100 yuan. Edible oil prices remained unchanged due to inactivity outside the market, and local observers anticipated a slight pullback of several hundred to a thousand yuan. Soybean transactions were scarce, with slight price adjustments. Raw peanuts were firm, and sesame prices were stable. Soybean cake also pulled back by nearly 100 yuan. The liquor market was very active, rising another 500 yuan and showing a firm trend.

The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's *Guoliang*, *Guoan*, and *Guoping* ships, towing three iron barges, arrived yesterday carrying 33,085 bags of rice from Wuhu. This rice is all public grain from the Grain Management Office.

### Anthracite Coal Blocks Alone Rise

Sales of white coal blocks and briquettes remained sluggish in coal shops. With the establishment of the People's Livelihood Coal Management Office, flat-price coal sales will soon be implemented, so buyers are taking a wait-and-see attitude, making transactions even scarcer. Only white coal fines and coal seams are being traded. However, anthracite coal blocks are selling well, and the source and inventory of anthracite coal blocks are insufficient, prompting sellers to collectively raise prices, leading to continuous price increases in recent days.

### Tea Cores In Short Supply

Red Edge tea cores, most popular with wholesalers, have been exceptionally favored by Jiangbei wholesalers recently. However, the inventory of this type of tea on the market is about to be exhausted, making it akin to trying to get fish from a tree. As for other types, sales continue to keep pace with supply, so buying sentiment remains spread throughout the market, and transactions show no signs of decreasing. Prices are uniformly trending upward, and the base is also being rapidly consolidated.

### Rayon Reaches New High, Silk Prices Flat and Weak

Yesterday's rayon market opened at 1,020,000 yuan at the No. 120 Tianjin Bridge, gradually rising to 1,070,000 yuan at the close. In the afternoon, it reached 1,090,000 yuan, setting a new record high, but transactions were very rare, few and far between. Warehouse receipts were priced at 825,000 yuan, with the final bid at 860,000 yuan, 230,000 yuan lower than spot prices. The prospect of warehouse receipts being released has been delayed, so there is no upward momentum. Front market merchants then lowered prices again. Factory conditions were flat, with some transactions among counterparts. Yesterday's silk market saw little interest, and prices became unsustainable. Meiya quilt covers were priced at 690,000 yuan per hundred, and Dacheng Gebi crepe at 1,960 yuan per yard. Rayon prices were stable. Minsheng brocade was priced at 9,800 yuan per piece, and Huajin crepe at 950 yuan per yard.

### Wire Nails Firm

The brisk sales of wire nails have persisted for months, mainly due to the diligent purchasing by customers from various regions. Recently, the Hankou wholesalers have been actively buying, and branch nails have been almost completely bought up. Because factory production is very slow, there is a risk of shortages. The current selling price per keg is 382,000 yuan for 3-point nails, 72,000 yuan for 4-point nails, 62,000 yuan for 5-point nails, 52,000 yuan for 6-point nails, 38,000 yuan for 1-inch nails, 33,000 yuan for 1.5-inch nails, 26,000 yuan for 2-inch nails, and 25,000 yuan for 2.5-inch nails, 24,000 for 3-inch nails. Due to the easy trade of wire nails, its raw material, 2-point Yang silver, has also risen accordingly, and is currently sold at 325,000 yuan per ton.

### Yarn Market Becomes More Stable; 16-Count Fine Yarn Rises 50-60,000

However, pickles are still selling well, and dried bamboo shoots are also stable and harmonious, preventing a slight pullback in the coming days.

Cotton Cloth: The market is showing signs of weakness due to the continuous dumping by the China Textile Construction Company.

Knitted Goods: Yesterday's market saw a mix of rises and falls. 32-count socks fell sharply yesterday morning as the gold price recovered, because they had risen too much last month. Undershirts alone continued to rise due to many parties intending to do well, with people fighting over them, resulting in continuous price increases and no goods available. However, health shirts and cotton shirts are less popular due to seasonal factors, so prices are stagnant. The wind of rising foreign paper has been curbed, because the price had risen excessively in anticipation of the rise, and there was no shortage of virtual price increases.

### The Complete Picture and Dynamics of the National Ritual and Music Museum

— By Wu Jia

The National Ritual and Music Museum was established in May of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933) by order of the Supreme National Defense Commission, and it was affiliated with the Ministry of Education. (The Music Education Committee originally established by the Ministry of Education was merged into the museum.) It was prepared and established by Gu Yuxiu, then Deputy Minister of Education, and Lu Qian, then a member of the Political Participation Council. The museum was located on Zhongshan Road in Beipei, Chongqing. The museum was organized as follows: under the director, there were three groups: General Affairs, Ritual System, and Music Classics. Each group had one director, a number of researchers, and a number of administrative personnel. The researchers were divided into four levels: compilers, reviewers, associate reviewers, and assistant reviewers. The administrative personnel were divided into two levels: group members and assistant group members. Since its establishment, the museum has been in existence for more than two years and has made many contributions to the establishment of rituals and music. Among the most prominent ones are the holding of ritual system discussion meetings (held at the museum on August 27 of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943) to discuss the draft ritual system prepared by the Ministry of Interior in the 27th year of the Republic (1938)), ritual system discussion meetings (held at Beibei Hot Springs on October 3 of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943) to discuss and approve the draft of the Five Rituals), and ritual system review meetings (held at the museum on May 18 of the 34th year of the Republic (1945) to discuss the issue of mourning attire); reviewing and approving national daily life etiquette and school etiquette; publishing "Ritual and Music," "Local Customs," "Victory Song Selections," "Marching Song Selections," and "Kunqu Selections"; collecting folk songs, conducting folk customs surveys, and providing wedding guidance. The work of the museum is carried out as follows: the General Affairs Group handles the daily general affairs of the museum; the work guidelines set by the Ritual System and Music Classics Groups are based on collecting, investigating, compiling, revising, and practicing, and experts are separately hired to preside over and carry out the work. However, it is said that because the scale of the museum is small and the national treasury is strained during the war, the business expenses obtained are very small, so it is difficult to concentrate talents and promote work. The museum is currently focusing its efforts on smaller-scale work. In terms of ritual system, it focuses on the collection and research of folk customs. In terms of music classics, it focuses on the review and publication of military songs, victory songs, and music teaching materials. It only seeks to cultivate without asking for harvest, in order to lay the foundation for future work. When the capital is returned, the funds and talents will be replenished, and the work will have new developments. The first director of the museum was Gu Yuxiu, who resigned in the winter of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943). The current director is Wang Dong. Lu Qian is the director of the Ritual System Group, Yang Yinliu is the director of the Music Classics Group, and Yang Zhongzi and 15 others have been hired as researchers at all levels.

The railway bureau has now issued a special notice to passengers that in the future, overweight luggage must be handed over to the station for transport to maintain order on the train. To avoid lost luggage, the railway is changing the luggage tags to thick paper tags and small cloth strips, indicating the luggage number and the names of the starting and ending stations, and tying them to the luggage to prevent errors and losses.

Tourist Bus Planned: The Transportation Department of the North China Railway Management Committee is currently planning to organize tourist buses. It is proposed to attach several cars to the back of special express trains every weekend. The locations will be scenic spots along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. It is reported that they are currently in contact with China Travel Service.

### Housing Rental Dispute in Hua'an Fang: Housing Management Committee Determines Solution; Chen Shiquan Reports on Work Overview

The Municipal Housing Rental Management Committee, in order to increase work efficiency, and Chen Shiquan, the concurrent Director of the Committee, paid close attention to the incident of over a hundred residents of Hua'an Fang on North Zhejiang Road suffering forced eviction and appealing for justice from all walks of life, to ensure fair handling and resolve the dispute. A sixth committee meeting was held yesterday, attended by Cha Liangjian, President of the Local Court; Pan Xulun, Accountant; Ge Kexin, Acting Director of the Social Affairs Bureau; Feng Youzhen, President of the Central News Agency; and representatives from the Garrison Headquarters. Director Chen reported on strengthening the committee's policy and the statistics of accepted cases. Since the establishment of the committee 50 days ago, 193 cases have been resolved through mediation and coordination between the two parties. These cases can be roughly divided into six categories: recovery for self-use, request for lease, request for eviction, reporting of illegal fees, illegal occupation of houses, and setting rent.

Thorough Discussion: In the handling of cases, the committee, concerning similar housing disputes to that of Hua'an Fang, has determined the lease event, and after referring to the actual situation in Shanghai and based on legal perspectives, conducted a thorough discussion. Therefore, whenever encountering such cases, it should comply with Chairman Chiang's instructions on people's livelihood, as well as Mayor Qian's aim to stabilize people's residence and protect the rights and interests of owners, and strictly crack down on the occupation of residential houses. For pre-war tenants requesting to continue leasing, houses previously rented to others by the enemy and puppets, and tenants who obtained lease rights from the enemy and puppets during the occupation period applying to the current landlord for continued lease, and residents occupying houses without any lease relationship.

Three Measures: The meeting decided on three unified measures: (1) If a pre-war tenant has no suitable residence and can provide evidence that their relocation was indeed due to the coercion of the enemy and puppets, they may sign a lease with the landlord to continue living there. Tenants who originally signed with the enemy and puppets and lived there should be required to move out within a limited time. (2) If no one makes the above claim, the landlord should sign a new lease with the current tenant according to the rent standard. (3) Those who occupy houses without any procedures should be ordered to move out according to law. It is also heard that these three regulations will be officially sent to the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau for coordination and to take the same steps. It is hoped that the residents and owners of Hua'an Fang should follow this correct path to achieve a reasonable solution and resolve the dispute.

### Second Batch of Liberty Ships to Be Taken Over Starting Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] The issue of taking over the China Merchants Bureau's Liberty ships.

The names of the second batch of four ships and the list of captains were also announced yesterday. The first batch of Liberty ships are ranked by the Hai character, followed by the characters Zhong, Xiao, Ren, Ai, Xin, Yi, He, and Ping. However, there are only six ships. The seventh Hai He ship and the eighth Hai Ping ship are still missing two ships. It is heard that they are being built in the United States. One theory is to use the Zhongshan Zhongtong ships to fill the gaps, but this has not yet been decided. It is heard that the second batch of six ships are Victory ships, and have been named Hai Su, Hai Zhe, Hai Wan, Hai Gan, Hai E, and Hai Xiang, six ships.

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables the Ministry of Finance to Amend the Business Tax Law

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in order to request the amendment of Article 5 of the Business Tax Law and Articles 9 and 13 of the Implementing Rules, cabled the Ministry of Finance yesterday:

Request for Change in Tax-Exempt Standard: "The Municipal Business Tax in Chongqing has recently been taken over by the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, and it is levied from October 21st of last year according to the announcement. However, the tax-exempt standard set in Article 5 of the Business Tax Law, the second item of which is 'based on the amount of operating capital, those with operating capital of less than 2,000 yuan,' the original legislative purpose was to consider the small-capital stores. However, in recent years, the currency value has changed dramatically, almost a ratio of one to a thousand compared to the time of legislation. According to the current and past ratios, stores that used to cost thousands of yuan now require hundreds of thousands of yuan. If the statutory tax-exempt standard is followed, then although there is the name of tax exemption, there is no actual tax exemption. We request that your Ministry refer to the current and past situations and change the regulations accordingly to suit the reality.

Uniform Standard for Definition of Capital: Also, Article 13 of the Implementing Rules of the Business Tax Law states that 'the amount of operating capital is calculated based on the original invested capital or paid-up capital, plus public reserve and undistributed profits,' regardless of whether it participates in business operations. Article 9 of the Implementing Rules of the Income Tax Law states that 'for profit-making enterprises of categories A and B, if there are public reserves, one-third can be included in the capital calculation, but only if they have participated in business operations.' That is, the capital for business tax should include all public reserves, while income tax only allows one-third to be included. Both are direct taxes levied by the state, but the definition of capital has the above-mentioned contradictory regulations, which seems inappropriate. We also request a change to a uniform standard so that merchants can follow it, which is fair and convenient. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits,

Please Also Amend the Manufacturing Industry Tax: The association also cabled the Ministry of Finance yesterday to request the amendment of the business tax on the manufacturing industry to be levied based on the amount of capital.

### Shanghai Electricity Supply Abolishes Tiered System

The Shanghai electricity price was previously approved by the Municipal Public Utility Bureau to use a tiered system. The first tier, those under ten degrees, was 12 yuan per degree. The second tier, those exceeding ten degrees but under twenty degrees, was 80 yuan per degree for the excess. The third tier, those exceeding twenty degrees, was 200 yuan per degree for the excess. Large users or institutional users were also divided into three tiers. Within the prescribed limit, it was 35 yuan per degree. Those exceeding the limit within 25 percent were 100 yuan per degree for the excess. Those exceeding the limit by more than 25 percent were 200 yuan per degree for the excess. Recently, due to rising coal prices, the Ministry of Economic Affairs approved an additional coal price surcharge of 12 yuan per degree. It is now learned that after the Shanghai Electric Power Company has been urged to reorganize, the power generation has increased. The previous tiered system is no longer necessary. All electric companies have been instructed to abolish the quota limit for large users. For small users (i.e., those within ten degrees), if their total monthly electricity consumption is more than fifteen degrees, they will be treated as large users. The rate will be uniformly calculated at 47 yuan per degree, without the need for application procedures, in order to lighten the burden on citizens. It is heard that the above measures will be implemented starting on the 16th of this month.

### Ample Gasoline Supply

### Where did the Assets of Japanese in Shanghai go?

— By H.R. Lieberman, originally published in the New York Times on November 31st

Since Japan's surrender, many Japanese assets in Shanghai, along with German assets, have disappeared. These assets were stolen and sold, converted into gold bars, U.S. dollars, foreign exchange, and other forms. The new asset holders are mostly Chinese, Portuguese, and White Russians using aliases. In addition, many assets have been hidden. What is the total value of the transferred and hidden assets? It is simply impossible to estimate. This is because it is difficult to trace the origins, and many documents have been destroyed or altered. According to official reports, the destroyed documents involve at least one bank, which was the trustee bank for the Japanese Navy and Army.

Secret Reports Take Effect The Shanghai Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau was established at the end of October. The bureau has encouraged everyone to secretly report documents, real estate, and movable property such as vehicles, ships, machinery, food, gold, silver, securities, and furniture related to enemy and puppet assets. The bureau also offers substantial rewards for the discovery of enemy and puppet assets as a result of reports: 20% for a total value of Chinese legal tender one million yuan, 15% for a total value under ten million yuan, 10% for a total value under one hundred million yuan, and 5% for a total value exceeding one hundred million yuan. According to Secretary Lu of the bureau, this approach has been very effective. In the second half of October, the bureau received 500 secret reports, which led to the discovery of 50,000 bales of cotton, 45,000 boxes of soap, 4,000 tons of metal, 500 pieces of machinery, 1,200 boxes of porcelain, as well as five factories, large quantities of newspapers, cloth, rice, wheat, flour, alcohol, etc., not to mention other small items. One day, a German came to the Shanghai Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau and voluntarily reported that a factory of his had been illegally occupied by Chinese. The handling bureau then sent people to investigate and indeed found something.

People Were Cautious From the time of Japan's surrender until Chinese officials came to Shanghai to effectively enforce their duties, there was a period of one month. During this month, many enemy and puppet assets had already been destroyed. Japanese merchants transported their assets, such as cotton, silk, and machinery, along with goods originally en route to Shanghai, to neutral countries for safekeeping. Goods not transported from warehouses and real estate were transferred to Chinese, Portuguese, and White Russians. Among them were even Japanese friendly cafe waitresses. The contents of factories and residences were moved and sold. When the Japanese sold their assets, they said it was not Japanese property. One printing factory was sold at a good price to one customer, but it was recorded as being sold separately to several customers, indicating that the Japanese were also cautious.

Gold Bars Used for Transactions All these transactions were calculated in gold bars (ten taels each), which were worth about 600 U.S. dollars at the time. The Japanese took these gold bars and buried some of them with people they considered very reliable, and some were transported out of China. According to bankers' estimates, by the end of the war, the gold that the Japanese had transported to Shanghai from Manchuria and Korea (for war needs), along with the existing gold, had reached five to eight times the pre-war amount.

Some of the proceeds from the transactions were in U.S. dollars, but they were not as valuable as gold bars. The Japanese also bought platinum, but they did not buy diamonds because they were not popular. The Japanese also obtained a considerable amount of Swiss francs and Swedish kronor, using Chinese names to avoid attention.

The Property Must Be Returned In principle, the resale of real estate can be traced, because the pre-war owners can return and use documents to prove that it is their property. However, the Japanese established several fake real estate companies to transfer real estate several times, making it impossible to trace and find the real responsible person. Some of the transfer documents were torn up or altered. The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau declared that the property must be returned to its original owner, regardless of what happened in between. The Japanese also bribed Chinese officials in an attempt to preserve their property. These disreputable officials have been reprimanded by Chairman Chiang and replaced with more honest people.

### Literature and Bread

— Yang Tongfang

I don't remember what year it was, but it was always six or seven years ago that I saw an article titled "Literature and Bread" published in an American magazine. At first glance, I thought it was about the lives of men of letters. The experiences of men of letters, whether Chinese or foreign, are always mostly full of ups and downs. In order to eat, men of letters have to bury themselves in writing, doing their best to create day and night. The result of hard thinking is only to exchange for a very small amount of living resources. The Chinese call it "writing books for the sake of rice rations," for the sake of a few斗 of rice. Impoverished Western writers also write to earn bread, also for the sake of eating. Intuitively, I thought the article was saying these things.

After reading it carefully, it wasn't like that at all. The article used witty and lively language to describe how the creation of literary works is exactly the same as the process and method of baking bread. The author based on the procedure and methods of manufacturing bread in a famous New York bread factory, comparing it to the writing skills of literary works. The conclusion is that the creation of literary works, although an art, is also a technique. After reading the article "Literature and Bread", I felt particularly fresh and interesting. Even now, I still think it is a very meaningful article. Unfortunately, the magazine that published the article has long been lost and cannot be found again, so I can only let it leave some vague impressions in my vague memory.

I think a literary work itself is a loaf of bread. For any kind of literary work, its materials are always limited, such as a novel or a play, even if there are many characters and the story is very tortuous, but the central idea that constitutes that novel or play is only one. That is to say, every novel or play has its "theme". A literary work that does not come out of the thread of the theme and does not see the "climax" is definitely not a successful work.

Therefore, the material for literary works is generally very simple, often a fragment of daily life, an accidentally discovered fact, some unnoticed small things, in the hands of the author, they can be rendered into a novel, or even a long novel of hundreds of pages, this is really like a little flour for making bread, which can become a big loaf of bread through "fermentation". Some of the materials that make up a literary work are just like a little flour, and also need to be skillfully handled by the author to make it undergo a literary "fermentation" to become a perfect work. The techniques of setting off, rendering, and refining in literary writing are similar to the various methods required when baking bread. When making bread, the appropriate technique is needed to apply that piece of dough to make it "ferment", the size of the heat is also very important, too much heat will scorch it, and not enough heat will not work, this all depends on the bread maker's ability to use his technique. How the literary author deals with his established subject matter, how to insert a small plot, how to develop the theme, how to show the climax, how to arouse the reader's "empathy", all need the author to use his technique. To achieve "pure fire", mature skill, and the manufacture of excellent bread seem to have similar meanings. Although, generally speaking, no matter how difficult a loaf of bread is to make, it is always much easier than writing a mature literary work.

Medicine

### New Panacea

— Zuoyou

In the near future, a brand new medicine will appear in the world. It can cure diseases that penicillin cannot cure, it is a good medicine for all kinds of difficult diseases, it is the nemesis of typhoid fever, bubonic plague, surgical sores, etc., it may even be able to cure pulmonary tuberculosis, and its name is Streptmycin.

The person who invented this thing is an American microbiologist named Waksman. He knew that there were some microorganisms on the surface of the soil that could kill the germs of diseases such as typhoid fever, dysentery and bubonic plague, so he mixed soil with water and then sprinkled the muddy water on a glass slide with cultured germs. He studied whether the germs on the glass slide were killed, and then tried to find the murderer who killed these germs. But these murderers were very powerful, not only could they kill animals, but also harm human life, and some could even kill people in a matter of seconds. Of course, Waksman could not use it to make medicine, so he had no success at first.

But in 1943, Cheng and his assistants found a microorganism called Actinomyces griseus. It can kill many germs, and Waksman refined the liquid containing this microorganism and called it Streptomyln.

But Waksman had no experience in making medicine and lacked the equipment for making medicine, so he asked a pharmaceutical factory to assist him in his work. He first wanted to know whether this thing was harmful when used on animals. The test results were quite satisfactory. After a large amount of Streptomycin was used on mice, there were no adverse reactions. Therefore, the pharmaceutical factory immediately mobilized fifty experts to study this novel medicine.

They first used it to test enteritis bacteria. In the laboratory, when enteritis bacteria encountered this medicine, they collapsed without resistance. So they took it to the hospital for testing. After the patient used this medicine, the disease was cured within twenty-four hours.

They then used it to treat typhoid fever. A patient suffering from typhoid fever for three weeks recovered very quickly after taking this medicine. Other patients who took it had the same results.

When this news spread, many doctors paid close attention to it. They applied this medicine to various patients, such as dysentery, bubonic plague, sores, etc., and all achieved miraculous effects.

But can this medicine cure pulmonary tuberculosis?

Several researchers applied it to animals with pulmonary disease and actually cured them. Although this medicine can cure animals with pulmonary disease, it is currently impossible to determine whether it can cure pulmonary tuberculosis patients.

However, we know that this medicine and penicillin are like peonies and green leaves, complementing each other. It can cure all the diseases that penicillin cannot cure. Because penicillin is an acidic medicine, and it is a basic medicine. These two medicines can be combined to make a panacea that is enough to deal with almost all diseases.

Publishing

### Commending Loyalty and Righteousness

— Junyi

In recent months, many publications such as "Ugly Histories" and "Secret Histories" about exposing the private lives of major and minor traitors have been found on newsstands, which are various and innumerable. It is naturally worthy of praise to report the past sins of these traitors, so that they can provide reference materials for the judicial organs during the trial, but some editors, in order to cater to the psychology of ordinary low-level readers, do not hesitate to focus on the erotic stories of "playing with women", and the words are described in detail, which is close to "inducing prostitution" and loses its original intention.

The sins of the traitors have been exposed, but why not commend the heroic deeds of those loyal people who sacrificed their lives for the country during the eight years of the War of Resistance? The area of the occupied area is so wide that it is not known how many martyrs were ravaged and killed by the enemy and puppet regimes. Among them, the stories of shocking the earth and weeping ghosts and gods, which can be sung and wept, are in the minority? If it can be collected and compiled into publications, why can't it attract readers? Although the work is more difficult, its value is far above these "ugly histories" and "secret histories". This will not only make the loyal deeds of thousands of martyrs who have been wronged under the ground immortal, but also allow the people of the world to learn from this and be vigilant in the future. At the same time, the government can use this historical material to settle this blood debt with the enemy. In this way, the task of compiling publications on the loyal and righteous deeds of martyrs cannot be ignored. It is hoped that the publishing industry will pay attention to it.

### Lessons from the Traitor Chen

— Tan Ziyou

It is reported that Chen Gongbo, the traitor, once asked for a mirror in his prison cell, and the guard replied: Why bother looking in the mirror?

Indeed, sitting in prison, the traitor Chen will not have anyone to "see" him, nor will the "friendly" Japan notify him to hold a "Greater East Asia Conference". What's the point of looking in the mirror? However, he did ask to borrow one. Because I had nothing to do in my spare time, I thought about it for a long time, and finally came up with a fairly reliable reason - but it's just what I came up with.

The traitor Chen is empty in the prison cell, and there is nothing to do. Writing memoirs and poems is certainly not in the mood, and looking at newspapers is also of little interest. Although a group of Chinese spies has not yet been tried in large numbers, what Laval, Pétain, Göring, Tojo... are bothering him. One night, probably the day before borrowing the mirror, he was lying on the bed, tossing and turning, and suddenly couldn't sleep. Originally, "the night in prison is especially long", he suddenly thought of his own affairs. He thought: Since I was escorted here from Japan, it has been several months. I haven't seen the sun during the day, and there are no electric lights at night. But what will happen to my fate? How is the official investigation of my crimes going? Will I be beheaded in the end? I don't dare to ask the jailer, and I can't figure it out even if I think hard. Suddenly, I thought of China's domestic product - physiognomy. Although I haven't learned it, I can probably see something about "complexion", although it may not be reliable, it can be used to relieve myself, so there is the act of borrowing a mirror.

If I guessed correctly, I would like to tell the guard that next time if the traitor Chen wants to borrow a mirror again, please lend it to him and let him see it clearly. And you should carefully watch his expression from the side. If it's not right - this is often an ominous sign - or even hear self-talk such as "Damn it, it's getting closer", "It's over, it's still an unlucky color", please also pass it on to the reporters, so that they can send a telegram to comfort the people: The big traitor is about to be tried.

Detective Work

### Tire Tracks

— Sun Jialin

Everyone knows that "fingerprints" are different for everyone and can be used to investigate cases and identify thieves, providing many conveniences for detectives. Now it has been discovered that "tire tracks" are also very valuable in detective work.

Every car has at least four rubber tires. After the vehicle speeds past, the tread pattern of the rubber tire is left on the road surface. Based on this tire track, investigators can determine what type of car passed by that place. If the tread pattern of each car's tire is different, it is not difficult to immediately determine the car's number and owner.

It seems impossible for each car to have a different tire. But American detective scholars have clearly indicated this possibility. There are now 333 different tread patterns applied to tires in the United States. If arbitrarily used on four wheels, there could be 503,107,995 cars with different tire tracks. This huge number is enough for all the cars in the United States to use.

Scientific forecasters say that in the near future, "tire trackology" will definitely be as developed and utilized in detective work as "fingerprintology". "Tire trackology" is still a very unfamiliar new term, but it will undoubtedly open a new era for criminology and be praised by everyone.

### Eradicating "Tigers Among Men"

— Baoshixi

Tigers eat people, and everyone is afraid of tigers, so "one turns pale at the mere mention of a tiger."

There is no need to be afraid of tigers in the mountains, because we can "easily avoid a spear in the open." "Tigers among men" must be feared, because their "arrows are difficult to defend against in the dark."

Looking back at the past, tigers in the mountains harm fewer people, and "tigers among men" harm more people. Before the war, the "Nazi tiger" in the Western Hemisphere once caused chaos and ate countless people. The "Japanese dwarf tiger" also caused landslides and ground fissures in the Eastern Hemisphere and ate many people.

There are also "Korean tigers", "Kwantung tigers", "Manila tigers", "Singapore tigers", "Wuxi tigers", "Nanjing tigers", "North Station tigers"... as well as "city tigers", "hoarding tigers", "paper tigers"... and so on. Fortunately, we have been able to repel the unbridled power of this group of human beasts, who act as if they are tigers, in today's day when the sun shines again, and have ended their "beastly" lives, while saving the "thin" lives of countless living beings, so that they will no longer be ravaged, insulted and massacred by them. [But we must still be careful to prevent them from resurrecting!]

For the present plan, we should rise up and attack! "If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you get the tiger's cubs?" Let us all "go deep into the tiger's den" and, with the spirit of "Wu Song beating the tiger," jointly expose this group of "tigers among men."

### Education Loan Fund Urgently Needs Funds

— Editor

Please all sectors of society contribute money and effort, so that impoverished students can continue their studies without interruption.

The reader scholarship advocated by this newspaper, starting from this session, has decided to merge with the *Xinwenbao* (新聞報) loan scholarship into the "Shanghai Education Loan Fund Committee" organized by the Municipal Education Association. From now on, the three parties will cooperate in handling it. This resolution has been announced by this newspaper on the 11th of this month. It is hoped that all readers, enthusiastic donors, authorities of various schools, and students aided by the two newspapers are well aware of this. This newspaper is currently drafting a report on the management of scholarships over the past five years, to be publicly reported to readers. On one hand, we intend to investigate the individuals who have donated the most to aid education over the years and request the government to commend them as an encouragement. On the other hand, the list of students who received assistance in the previous session, except for those whose family circumstances have recently improved and do not require public assistance, and those whose academic performance this semester is poor, will be recommended to the Education Loan Fund Committee for continued assistance to prevent them from dropping out of school. We will handle these two matters separately within the shortest possible time and bring them to a conclusion.

Now, what we hope for from all sectors of society is: Please consider the ten thousand (Note: This newspaper has 2,500 assisted students, *Xinwenbao* has 4,500, and we plan to recruit 3,000 new students, totaling the above number) anxious youths who are afraid of dropping out of school one day, and continuously contribute money and effort, and enthusiastically donate. Those who have enthusiastically donated in the past, please continue to donate; those who have enthusiastically solicited donations in the past, please continue to solicit donations. This constructive and proactive righteous act requires the joint efforts of the entire society to be successful. Anyway, those who previously had to donate to both newspapers simultaneously, now only have one target, the only scholarship fund in all of Shanghai, isn't it easier to handle? According to the Education Loan Fund Committee's estimate, if each of the ten thousand students is assisted with an average of ten thousand yuan, then one hundred million yuan is needed. Currently, only twenty million yuan has been donated, which is still far from the target!

Reader's Letter

### Aid the Wrongful Death Case of Qian Ai Chu

Six readers of this newspaper in Hangzhou, including Mr. Chen Xinmu, sent a letter from Military Post Office No. 281, which reads: "Editor: Having read the 'New Widow Appeals for Husband's Injustice' in the reader's letter section of the social service page of your newspaper on the 13th, we have the following thoughts and request that they be published on the original page.

1.  What kind of sympathy should the general public have towards this incident?

2.  How will the Shanghai Police Department handle this matter? Please announce it publicly.

3.  Since Xu Xianzong, a staff member of the judicial section of the Changning District Police Department, recognizes Qian Aichu as a gambler, may we ask, should gamblers be executed by shooting?

4.  If the matter is confirmed, can the judicial authorities file a public prosecution?

5.  Please provide the detailed address of the person involved." Chen Xinlu, Wei Yi, Huang Weixian, Xu Binxing, Feng Zaiyin, Song Yuanjun. (Note) The person involved lives at No. 7, Dingye Lane, Wujiaochang, Caojiadu, Shanghai.

### Shao Zonghan in Medan

A letter from Mr. Tan Junhang of Juxingcheng Bank, Leshan, Sichuan, reads: "Editor: I previously read the missing person advertisement for Shao Zonghan in the social service column of your newspaper on December 28th. Now, I have learned from a friend in Chongqing that Mr. Shao Zonghan is currently in Medan, Sumatra, Nanyang, presiding over the *Minzhu Ribao* (民主日報) newspaper. I originally intended to inform his family to relieve their worries. However, since I do not have the original newspaper, I am unable to find the address of Mr. Shao's family at the moment. I would like to trouble you to check the address of Mr. Shao's family in the original manuscript and forward this message. I believe you can help. Sincerely, Tan Yaozong."

### Published Letters

Regarding: According to my client, Mr. Tao Heng, he read a letter of appeal signed by Shen Xizhen in the social service column of *Shenbao* (申報) on the 15th of this month, which is far from the truth and extremely shocking. Upon investigation, Shen Liqing, also known as Shen Yanqing, learned in October of the 32nd year of the Republic that Hengsheng Company was assigned 200,000 yuan in counterfeit currency shares by the China Raw Leather Co., Ltd., and requested to attach 100,000 yuan of shares under the alias of Xiji. From the attachment of shares to the distribution of dividends, until the company ceased operations, Mr. Shen personally handled the handover, and there was no such person as Shen Xizhen. Now that the company is closed, I am only a common shareholder and can only wait for a legal resolution. If Mr. Shen believes that he should deal with the matter in any way, he should also discuss it with his fellow villagers and proceed together. There is no reason to aimlessly target me, and even less reason to evade and collude with an unknown third party to make any demands. Since this Shen Xizhen claims to be a woman and has never met me or is familiar with me, how could she dispose of property to attach shares? Isn't this a joke? In addition to entrusting a direct letter to Shen Liqing, also known as Shen Liqing, for negotiation, I am deeply afraid that the rumors are untrue. Please immediately represent the letter and ask *Shenbao* to correct the matter. I sincerely hope that you will publish it in the letters column to clarify the facts. Respectfully, Mr. Editor of *Shenbao*, Lawyer Deng Jiabing.
