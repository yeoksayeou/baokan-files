[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th Dispatch] The 9th and 32nd Executive Groups, brought by Marshall's special plane, flew back to Hankou yesterday afternoon with mediation opinions compromised by both sides. After arriving in Hankou, the Wuhan Headquarters will decide. As for the way out for the Communist troops, Zhou Enlai made a request to Marshall at noon yesterday, hoping that the government troops could provide the Communist army with a way to go to North China, so that the Central Plains War could be eliminated. Around 5:00 p.m., Marshall relayed this opinion to Chairman Chiang, with Madame Chiang as the translator.

### Interview with Stuart - Snow-White Beard and No Teeth But Energetic - He Hopes for a Democratic and Unified China

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th Dispatch] The reporter drove to the lakeside of Weiming Lake in the western suburbs yesterday to interview the newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to China, Dr. Stuart. At that time, Dr. Stuart was meeting with the faculty and staff of Yanjing University and made time for a brief two-minute conversation with the reporter. Stuart said: "I originally didn't like being an official, but the urgent situation in China and the difficulties of Marshall's work make it necessary for me to contribute my efforts. Although President Truman has submitted this new appointment to Congress, it will take about one or two weeks for Congress to pass it and complete the necessary procedures. I will go to Nanjing on Saturday or Sunday as a private citizen to assist Marshall in his work and prepare everything. The reporter asked how he would promote Sino-U.S. relations in the future? Stuart replied: "The method will be changed, but the goal is unchanged." A reporter asked: "What is the future of the KMT-CPC negotiations?" He replied: "I hope to establish a coalition government as soon as possible, which is what Marshall has been hoping for for a long time." The reporter asked: "How should Sino-U.S. economic relations be promoted without destroying China's national industry and the commercial interests of the United States?" He humbly said: "I am a layman, but I must carefully study this issue." The reporter asked: "Is Marshall going to return to the United States recently? And when will Wedemeyer come?" He replied that he did not know. He finally said that he hopes for a peaceful, democratic, and unified China, developed transportation, developed industry, and improved people's living standards. He is 71 years old this year, with thick eyebrows like snow, no teeth left, and a body that is slightly thinner and smaller than the average Westerner, and he is very energetic. During Stuart's term as ambassador, Yanjing University will organize a temporary committee to handle school affairs.

[United Press, Beiping, 12th Dispatch] According to the "World Daily" today: The new U.S. Ambassador to China, Stuart, had a separate interview with the newspaper's reporter and said: "The current stalemate between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is due to the complete lack of mutual trust between the two sides. The current task is to completely stop military action. The ultimate goal of our efforts is to seek the establishment of a unified coalition government. I do not believe that the Chinese issue can be resolved by war. I hope that the Communist Party can pay attention to the interests of all the Chinese people. I sincerely admire Chairman Chiang's tolerance and generosity. The only policy of the United States toward China is unity, democracy, and peace."

We believe that under the joint efforts of Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, all parties will be moved to move towards peace.

### Chiang Ting-fu Received Reporters Yesterday and Explained the Work of "CNRRA"

He Responded One by One to the Accusations of UNRRA Staff Members Regarding Various Points. The LaGuardia Measures Were Not Consulted with the U.S. Government.

[Central News Agency, Washington, November 11, United Press] According to government officials, LaGuardia's decision to suspend all UNRRA materials to China except for urgently needed food should not be regarded as reflecting the opinion of the U.S. government. He did not even consult with the government before issuing the order.

[Central News Agency, New York, November 12] UNRRA officials stationed in Shanghai telegraphed UNRRA Director LaGuardia, protesting reports in several New York afternoon newspapers that the Chinese government was misusing UNRRA supplies.

[Our Newspaper] Chiang Ting-fu, Director of the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA), received Chinese and foreign reporters in the city yesterday. The number of attendees was unprecedented in recent reporter receptions. Mr. Chiang immediately issued a written statement explaining the UNRRA Director's announcement of the suspension of material transportation to China and answered various questions raised by the reporters. (Photo: Chiang Ting-fu)

Opinions of UNRRA Staff Members are Indeed Worth Valuing

Regarding the joint telegram sent by UNRRA staff members in Shanghai to the UNRRA Director, Mr. Chiang said: "Although some of the signatories have only been in China for a short time and are not very familiar with the progress of CNRRA's operations in various regions, I believe that the opinions of my UNRRA colleagues are still worth valuing. We wholeheartedly welcome criticisms from the outside world regarding CNRRA, as long as they are based on a clear understanding of the situation and are constructive."

The main points of the telegram are: (1) After UNRRA materials arrive in China, they are not quickly transferred to the areas with the greatest need, resulting in a large amount of materials being stockpiled at the Shanghai docks; (2) Materials are being used as political tools, with political discrimination in distribution, which is inconsistent with the principle of treating everyone equally. Mr. Chiang said: If the friendly relationship between China and the 47 friendly countries that donated materials to China is damaged because of this, it would be the greatest misfortune. However, "the main facts cited are based on misunderstandings and fail to consider the special difficulties encountered in implementing the post-war relief and rehabilitation plan in China after eight years of trauma."

Most of the Materials Shipped by UNRRA Have Already Been Transported Inland

Regarding the point that materials have not been quickly transferred, Mr. Chiang explained: (1) China's situation is very different from that of European countries. All transportation systems were almost completely destroyed after the war. During the first half of the year, CNRRA's work was hampered by particularly low river water levels, which made navigation difficult. Furthermore, at the beginning of this year, the tonnage of river transport vessels was less than half of what it was before the war, so it was inevitable that materials would be slightly delayed. However, as of July 3 of this year, out of the 559,040 tons of materials unloaded by UNRRA, CNRRA had already transported 481,140 tons inland. In the three months of April, May, and June, the amount of materials transported inland by CNRRA exceeded the amount imported by UNRRA into Shanghai in each of those months. For example, in April, 80,099 tons were imported and 103,248 tons were transported inland; in May, 108,598 tons were imported and 150,518 tons were transported inland; in June, 63,010 tons were imported and 78,631 tons were transported inland. (2) Currently, there are 79,000 tons of materials still stored at the port docks. After the sudden end of the Pacific War, in the first three months, there were 16 ocean-going vessels that were originally heading to other countries but were rerouted to China in international waters. The materials they carried were all purchased by UNRRA to provide the most rapid relief to China. UNRRA's good intentions are admirable, but in fact, the cargo manifests of each vessel were extremely incomplete. "The names of items were also wrongly added to many crates, and thousands of crates had to be opened before the contents could be determined." These materials were all purchased on an as-is basis, so "there were many items that China needed, but were not within the UNRRA plan, and may not be useful in China, or although useful, could only be used after domestic transportation was restored." This led to "difficulties in carrying out systematic receiving and processing in the dock warehouses." (3) UNRRA has not completely handed over all the materials currently stored in the warehouses, and CNRRA has not completely received them. (4) Among the surplus U.S. military materials shipped by UNRRA, "there are some damaged and old items, and not all of them can be used immediately, so the problem of receiving and handling is even more difficult." (5) Some materials must remain in Shanghai for assembly and modification, such as trucks that need to be assembled, medical equipment that needs to be boxed, wheat that needs to be ground into flour, and canned food that needs to be inspected (Mr. Chiang pointed out that there were 5,000 tons of canned food in the warehouse, all of which were surplus U.S. military materials, and many were rotten when delivered).

It is Not Easy to Carry Out Relief in Areas Controlled by the Communist Army

Regarding the second point pointed out by UNRRA staff members, the so-called political discrimination issue, Mr. Chiang emphasized two points: (1) "I am the officially appointed representative of the National Government to attend all UNRRA General Assembly meetings. I personally participated in drafting the UNRRA General Assembly resolutions and attach great importance to the spirit and principles of the General Assembly resolutions. I hereby inform you that this office has constantly strived to find ways to transport a reasonable amount of materials into the areas controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. It would be a great misunderstanding to say that the materials transported by this office into the areas controlled by the Chinese Communist Party are less than 2% of the materials delivered by UNRRA to China, because some types of UNRRA materials, such as locomotives, railway equipment, ships, and river defense equipment, are never allocated to the people by this office. Even trucks are never allocated to any area by this office, but are used to transport materials to various places as needed to help the disaster victims." (2) Eighty percent of the materials shipped to China by UNRRA are food, and most of the areas controlled by the Communist Army are grain-producing areas. CNRRA's distribution of materials must be based on the needs of each area.

Mr. Chiang said: It is indeed quite difficult to carry out relief in the communist-controlled areas, but "CNRRA" still follows the instructions of Chairman Chiang and President Song, and his own orders, without avoiding difficulties, to transport a fair amount of materials to those areas. Recently, "CNRRA" has also established two offices in Yantai and Heze in the communist-controlled areas of Shandong Province to specifically handle relief matters in that area. Due to his duties, Mr. Chiang has often maintained contact with Mr. Zhou Enlai and Mr. Dong Biwu, and they "have never protested to me or expressed any dissatisfaction regarding distribution issues." CNRRA is transparent in everything it does, and Mr. Chiang "is confident that the UNRRA Director will resume transportation to China after reviewing the actual situation of the work in China," and "CNRRA will be able to carry through to the end and achieve valuable success."

If Material Transportation is Suspended for Too Long, the Revival Will Be Affected

Mr. Chiang then answered questions from the reporters, saying: (1) The improvement of "CNRRA's" distribution system is the responsibility of the CNRRA's executive director; (2) The main reason for "UNRRA's" decision this time is the accumulation of materials in the warehouses, which has led to poor transportation, and it is not intended to reduce China's benefits. China's greatest needs are food and rehabilitation equipment. Currently, food is still being supplied as usual, but if the transportation of other materials is suspended for too long, the revival will inevitably be affected; (3) The policy-making bodies of "UNRRA" are the General Assembly and the Central Authority, in which China has representatives. The "UNRRA" Director's action this time was not approved by these two bodies. China has now made representations to the "UNRRA" Director, because this action is an administrative issue rather than a policy issue, so it cannot be submitted to the General Assembly; (4) Of "CNRRA's" expenses, administrative expenses are paid by the Chinese government, and half of the operating expenses are guaranteed by the government and borrowed from banks, and half are obtained by selling materials. So far, CNRRA's operating expenses have totaled approximately US$10 million; (5) Regarding the rumor that Mr. LaGuardia will come to China within the month, Mr. Chiang had not heard of it.

UNRRA Director Announced He Will Recall the Deputy Director

[United Press, Washington, November 11] UNRRA Director LaGuardia announced today that the Acting Director of the UNRRA China Office, Mr. Lai, will be recalled, and his successor will be announced soon. According to UNRRA sources, a temporary emergency meeting of a committee will be held in Shanghai on the 17th of this month to discuss the various issues caused by LaGuardia's announcement of the suspension of relief supplies to China. LaGuardia also said that he will go to Europe to attend the UNRRA Council meeting in Geneva on August 5. Relief matters in Europe will end at the end of this year, so this meeting will be the last one. As for relief matters in China, although it has been stipulated that it will end at the end of March next year, the materials supplied for China may not be completed by then, so they must be manufactured and handed over at any time.

### Wuxian County Suffers from Continuous Rain and Flooding, Inundating Tens of Thousands of Mu of Farmland

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, November 12] For the past two weeks, this county has been experiencing continuous heavy rain, and the river water has risen sharply. Low-lying areas have become swamps, and tens of thousands of mu of farmland have been flooded. The disaster is already taking shape and is deeply worrying. The most severely affected areas are the various villages in the fifth district of the county, such as Xudu Village, because they are all located near Taihu Lake and have low-lying terrain. After continuous wind and rain, the lake water overflowed, broke through the embankments, and flooded into the fields, with water accumulating several feet deep. Houses were washed away, cattle drowned, and agricultural tools were scattered by the floodwaters. The disaster situation is extremely tragic. Currently, there are thousands of disaster victims in the affected area who are without food or clothing. Although the township offices have reported the disaster situation to the county for assistance, there is no good solution.

### LaGuardia Talks About the Intention of Suspension: To Help China Transport Materials to the Interior

[Central News Agency, Washington, November 10] (Delayed) UNRRA Director LaGuardia told reporters today that his temporary suspension of material transportation to China does not mean stopping relief to China. This move is also to help China quickly transport relief materials to the interior. He declared that emergency food will continue to be transported, but the food unloaded at the ports of Shanghai, Kowloon, and Qingdao must be cleared immediately. LaGuardia said that there are currently 20 ships unloading goods in Shanghai, and another 20 are waiting for empty docks. He emphasized that agricultural and industrial machinery will not be transported again until the ports, which are already "suffering from congestion," are cleared. Regarding this, LaGuardia said that the petition from UNRRA China Office staff did not affect his actions. He had anticipated this action before taking office as Director. The Director of the UNRRA China Office will be announced soon, but he declined to specify who it would be. LaGuardia also told reporters not to confuse UNRRA with CNRRA. He accused CNRRA of demanding "good items" and blaming UNRRA for replacing them with unsatisfactory items. LaGuardia frankly stated that according to the UNRRA charter, food must be transported to all areas in need, regardless of political beliefs. He said that although internal transportation is difficult, everyone knows it, but he believes there is room for improvement. He hopes that food transportation will be rapid. LaGuardia also announced that he had sent a letter to Chairman Chiang on May 28, suggesting improvements to the method of distributing supplies so that China could continue to receive UNRRA materials. LaGuardia said that he had received a generally courteous reply from the government. This morning, Acting Secretary of State Acheson told reporters that he had learned that LaGuardia had sent a letter to Chairman Chiang, but declined to comment on the current situation.

### Hu Shih Flew from Shanghai to Beijing and Spoke Freely with Reporters About His Impressions of the Past Nine Years in the United States. He Will Visit Chairman Chiang and then Go to Peking to Take Over His Duties.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, November 12] Dr. Hu Shih, President of National Peking University, flew from Shanghai to Nanjing at 10:00 a.m. on the 12th. Zhu Jiahua, Wang Shijie, Chiang Menglin, Hang Liwu, Liu Kai, and others went to the airport to welcome him. Mr. Hu has been abroad for nine years, and now that he has returned, his hair is already gray, but his spirit is still very robust. When reporters asked about his impressions of his travels in the United States, Mr. Hu said: "I have lived in the United States for more than 20 years, and I feel that the foundation of the United States is solid, its economy and industry are advancing rapidly, and the strength of its social organizations is unexpectedly great." He continued: "During the war, the U.S. government, due to war-related reasons, trained students in various universities to learn the languages of countries such as China, Japan, and Burma. There were thousands of people studying Chinese throughout the country, and some of them may continue to study in depth to become new talents." When reporters asked about his political views, Mr. Hu said that he had been in the United States for nine years and was not very familiar with the domestic situation, so he did not want to express his opinions. He said in a guarded tone: "I would like to take five months to study as a student." He described his research work in the United States, saying that he had spent more than four years reorganizing Chinese intellectual history and old works. Some of them have been revised, and he has also written several monographs. This reorganization work remains to be completed. Regarding cultural cooperation between China and foreign countries and post-war cultural construction, Mr. Hu said: "The exchange of professors and sending students abroad are greatly affected by foreign exchange. The foreign language proficiency of students also needs to be discussed. Domestic cultural workers cannot maintain their livelihoods, which greatly affects research work. As for cultural construction, it will still be based on the self-efforts of domestic cultural institutions and will require long-term efforts. Emphasis should also be placed on basic sciences." Mr. Hu will visit Chairman Chiang in the coming days and consult with Vice President Fu Sinian, who is currently acting as president, about the issue of Peking University's resumption of operations. After a short stay, he will go to Shanghai to pick up his family and transfer to Peking. Minister Wang Shijie will hold a welcome reception for Mr. Hu at the International Social Center from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. on the 15th.

### Jiang Kanghu, a Traitor, Was Tried Yesterday. He Claimed to Be a Member with no Real Power. Wang Shijing, another Traitor, Preserved the Silver in Tianjin.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, November 12] At 10:00 a.m. this morning, the Capital High Court publicly tried Jiang Kanghu, the puppet Minister of the Examination Yuan. Jiang was hunched over, his shoulders were crooked, and he was so emaciated that he was no longer human. According to his confession, he is 64 years old, from Jiangxi, passed the county-level imperial examination at the age of 14 (late Qing Dynasty), studied in Japan at the age of 18, and became a professor at Kyoto University at the age of 20. He once organized the Socialist Party. In the second year of the Republic (1913), he went to the United States with former Chairman Lin Sen and served as a professor at the University of California and the director of the Oriental Literature Department of the Library of Congress in the United States for many years. In the 28th year of the Republic (1939), he was summoned by Wang Jingwei and joined the puppet organization. He claimed that Wang Jingwei's later actions were surrounded by petty people and were very dictatorial. He put forward six points of opinion: (1) He did not recognize traitors; (2) The regulations on punishing traitors were not known in the occupied areas, so they could not be applied; (3) His position as a member of the Central Political Committee was an ex officio member with no voting rights; (4) He opposed the declaration of war against Britain and the United States; (5) Although the treaties signed with the Japanese invaders were humiliating and detrimental to national sovereignty, the fact was that the country had already been occupied at that time, so it was not easy to regain some rights; (6) The Examination Yuan had no treasonous actions. The trial adjourned at noon, and the court ordered a retrial at a later date. Jiang was returned to custody.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, November 12] Wang Shijing, the puppet President of the United Reserve Bank of North China, said during his preliminary hearing at the Capital High Court on the 12th that the total amount of notes issued by the puppet bank as of the enemy's surrender was 123.8 billion yuan, and the gold turned over was 5 tons. In addition, he presented evidence that the silver, amounting to 60 million yuan, used as issuing reserves in Tianjin before the war, was preserved under his protection without any loss, and was turned over to Manager Bian of the Central Bank after the victory. Wang was interrogated at the High Court at 4:30 p.m. today. Renowned lawyer Jiang Yong was his defense lawyer, and lawyer Cui Peijun, appointed by the court, also appeared in court. In addition to the two matters listed above, the defendant tried his best to explain that his collaboration with the enemy was not "unavoidable" but "purposeful." He claimed that since the September 18th Incident (1931), he had always remained in the Northeast as the manager of the Bank of China in the Northeast and had established contact with Wang Pengsheng, director of the International Affairs Research Institute of the Military Commission, for intelligence. Later, he successively served as the Minister of Finance of the puppet Provisional Government of North China, the President of the Puppet Reserve Bank, the Standing Committee Member of the Puppet North China Political Affairs Commission and the Governor-General of the Finance Department, and the Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Puppet North China Political Affairs Commission. During the seven and a half years, he maintained close contact with Wang Pengsheng, provided intelligence, and flew to Chongqing to report after the victory and returned to Peking to handle the handover and reception. He requested the court to investigate the evidence in detail and conduct a fair trial. At 6:30 p.m., the court ordered him to present more concrete evidence and scheduled another trial.

### Editorial: The Problem of UNRRA Halting the Shipment of Supplies to China

Washington, 9th Dispatch: UNRRA Director LaGuardia announced that, effective immediately, all UNRRA industrial and agricultural equipment shipments to China would be suspended. However, essential food supplies such as wheat, rice, grains, and milk would continue to be shipped, conditional on the Chinese government quickly clearing the ports and the CNRRA (Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) distributing relief supplies to the Chinese interior in a satisfactory manner. This unexpected action by LaGuardia was reportedly based on reports from some officials and staff of the UNRRA Shanghai branch, citing two main reasons: first, the Chinese government failed to provide funding, hindering the rapid distribution of relief supplies to the interior; second, the Chinese government allocated too little to the Communist areas, raising suspicions that the government was using relief supplies as a tool for political struggle.

However, a subsequent dispatch on the 11th stated that LaGuardia clarified the matter, saying that his intention was only to help China resolve port congestion, not to stop relief work in China. As long as ports like Shanghai, Kowloon, and Qingdao are cleared, UNRRA can continue to ship relief supplies to China. This coincides with what the Chinese government spokesperson said the day before: "The initial impression of the general public is that this is a political action, but in reality, it is due to the congestion in Shanghai's port." Furthermore, U.S. government officials stated that this action by UNRRA should not be regarded as reflecting the opinion of the U.S. government. It is evident that rumors circulating outside, implying serious political implications, are clearly propaganda with ulterior motives.

Regarding this matter, in addition to the statement issued by the Chinese government spokesperson the day before, Chiang Ting-fu, Director-General of CNRRA, also met with reporters yesterday afternoon and responded. He mainly explained that the CNRRA's distribution of relief supplies was not based on political regions but solely on the needs of each area and the convenience of transportation. Out of the 560,000 tons of UNRRA supplies shipped to China, the CNRRA has already transported 480,000 tons to the interior. Therefore, Director-General Chiang firmly believes that LaGuardia, upon understanding the true situation, will quickly restore the shipment of supplies to China.

We believe that the UNRRA Director's action is indeed due to the current transportation difficulties in China. At the same time, we also believe that the Chinese government and society are very anxious to find ways to clear transportation routes. The instruction from Chairman Chiang, stating that transportation of relief supplies and personnel should be given priority and not be delayed or obstructed, should be regarded as representing the attitude of the Chinese government. According to Liu Nianzhi, General Manager of the Shanghai China Dock Company, the congestion in various docks and warehouses in the city has improved slightly recently, but the supplies stockpiled by public entities and UNRRA remain substantial, often unmoved for months, causing incoming ships carrying cargo to be unable to unload upon arrival, with an average of twenty ships being detained in the port daily. This shows that society is also paying close attention to and striving to improve the clearance of Shanghai's port. Now, with the stimulus of the UNRRA Director's announcement of the temporary suspension of industrial and agricultural equipment shipments, those responsible for managing transportation will likely expedite clearance efforts. If this can be achieved, then, as LaGuardia explained, relief supplies can naturally continue to be shipped to China without doubt.

However, in any case, we are very saddened by the suddenness of the UNRRA Director's action, and even more saddened that some officials and staff of the UNRRA China branch may harbor some prejudices towards the situation in China. During this World War, China suffered the longest from the ravages of war, with the most severe damage to industry and agriculture. Famines like those in Hunan and Guangxi were largely caused by enemy destruction. Transportation and industry were devastated first by the Japanese army and then by the Communist army, making them particularly dilapidated. No country in the world needs relief for the restoration of its industry and agriculture more than China. The suspension of relief supplies will cause greater and longer-lasting suffering to most Chinese people. This is certainly not the original intention of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and it violates the grand aspiration of the late U.S. President Roosevelt to help the poor and save lives. It is indeed not easy to quickly and universally transport any kind of supplies to impoverished areas in the interior. The enormous transportation costs are unimaginable. The unloading expenses for one ship of supplies alone require 100 million legal tender, not including warehouse storage fees. When the Chinese government's finances were extremely difficult after the war, it still allocated 4,320 billion legal tender in the budget. To achieve rapid distribution of supplies, the CNRRA had to sell some of the relief supplies, but it did not exceed the principle set by President Truman, that is, the portion of UNRRA supplies sold should only be used to supplement insufficient funding. Now, some people in the UNRRA branch are criticizing the Chinese government for not providing sufficient funding and arguing that the CNRRA should not sell relief supplies, which is unreasonable in both principle and fact.

As for the areas occupied by the Communist army, the Chinese government has never discriminated. The Chinese government represents the entire Chinese people and naturally treats everyone equally, with no divisions in relief work. On the contrary, CNRRA relief supplies passing through Communist-controlled areas are often forcibly detained by the Communist army and cannot be distributed to the disaster victims. Recent incidents include: (1) Over 2,000 catties of cotton seeds transported by the CNRRA from Yuncheng were detained in Jishan; (2) 885 bags of flour and some milk powder transported by the CNRRA from Jinan to Liaocheng were detained outside Liaocheng; (3) Fourteen CNRRA trucks traveling empty from Jinan to Qingdao were detained when passing through Yidu. All these incidents have been reported to Zhou Enlai with a request for release, but no response has been received so far. However, despite the Communist army's detention, the CNRRA is still striving to transport relief supplies to the Communist-controlled areas. For example, 1,300 tons were transported to Yantai yesterday, and recently, relief supplies have often been transported to northern Jiangsu. These are all undeniable facts.

According to the explanation of Chiang Ting-fu, Director-General of CNRRA, the Communist-controlled areas mostly produce grain and require less food relief. However, they have a great need for medicines, and the CNRRA often purchases large quantities of medicines to supply them because UNRRA sometimes cannot meet this demand. It is also evident that the Communist army's destruction of transportation everywhere makes it increasingly difficult to transport relief supplies, and the inconsistent orders from various military units make it impossible for relief workers to operate. Now, some people in the UNRRA branch want to place all the responsibility entirely on the National Government, thus recommending that UNRRA stop supplying materials to punish the Chinese people. Fortunately, the UNRRA Director stated that he did not stop all shipments of relief supplies to China based on their reasons. Otherwise, would it be very unwise to act unwisely? Because now there are some elements who are expanding their "anti-American" propaganda on one hand and weakening the credibility of the National Government on the other, they must take advantage of any opportunity. We only need to see that as soon as the UNRRA Director's order was issued, the Communist spokespersons in Nanjing and Beiping successively issued lengthy talks, exaggerating the unfairness of the CNRRA's distribution of materials, and the American Communist Herten also represented the so-called "Communist Area Relief Association," propagating that the Communist area did not receive any relief materials. From these traces, we can know how the Communist Party and its kind are singing a duet, trying their best to alienate Sino-American friendship. Because of this, we believe that UNRRA can earnestly discuss with the Chinese government to improve transportation methods, but should never abandon eating because of choking and stop shipping relief supplies to China, giving these "anti-American" propagandists a new opportunity.

### Four Foreign Ministers Conclude Two-Day Discussion; No Agreement Reached on German Issue; Decision to Postpone Meeting and Reconvene in November

[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 12th Broadcast: When the four-power foreign ministers' meeting reopened this afternoon, Burns launched another attack on the economic barriers to the division of Germany, demanding that the Soviet Union support the unification plan, and implying that if the Soviet Union could accept this plan, the United States would allow the shipment of reparations from the U.S. occupied zone to the Soviet occupied zone. This meeting is feared to be the last meeting, and Burns is preparing to fly back to the country on Saturday. Molotov proposed to end the meeting today. The foreign ministers of the four countries are eager to return to their countries so that they can have a chance to rest before attending the peace conference on July 29.

[Another News] San Francisco, 12th Broadcast: Burns today criticized the Soviet Union in harsh terms, due to the cession of Silesia and the Konigsberg East Prussian region, it has directly and indirectly obtained 14 billion yuan of compensation from Germany, in response to Molotov's repeated request to demand 10 billion yuan of compensation from Germany based on the Yalta Agreement. In his speech yesterday, Mr. Bei categorically stated that the agreement has not yet been established. According to the Potsdam regulations, Soviet reparations should be obtained from the country's occupied area and supplemented by the limited factory equipment in the west. He also said that the number of reparations that the Soviet Union has obtained from the Soviet-occupied zone cannot be estimated accurately.

[French News Agency, Paris, 11th Electricity] The four-nation foreign ministers' meeting continued today and decided to postpone the meeting until November of this year after another meeting on the 13th of this month, and then hold a temporary meeting to discuss the German issue. The meeting lasted for four and a half hours today, discussing the issue of compensation, setting up a small group committee to investigate the actual situation of Germany's demilitarization, and other issues related to the country, and no agreement was reached. Today's meeting was chaired by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, who immediately requested that the four powers decide on the date of the postponement. U.S. Secretary of State Burns replied that the German and Austrian issues must be discussed before they can be concluded, but the four powers finally agreed to postpone the meeting on the 13th and hold two meetings tomorrow morning and afternoon to complete the current work.

[Reuters, Paris, 11th Electricity] The Foreign Ministers' meeting discussed the German issue all day today. Burns proposed that one or all of the other three occupation zones of Germany should join the U.S. military zone to form a unified economy. It is best to set up a central economic institution in the whole of Germany in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. He also suggested that the Saar region may not be temporarily included in the jurisdiction of these economic institutions, but should still be governed by France pending the final resolution of the German Western Frontier issue. Bevan also suggested reducing the economic barriers between the German occupation zones so that materials can be freely exchanged, all of which were opposed by Molotov. Bevan said that Britain no longer intends to continue borrowing to maintain the relief work in the British military zone. The industry in the British military zone must be restored to production, so that the whole region no longer relies entirely on Britain. Therefore, the establishment of a unified national economy, based on the experience of the occupation zones, to promote the economic self-reliance of the bridge country is the best proposal. The four foreign ministers discussed for a long time, but no agreement was reached. Finally, Molotov's request was still agreed, and it was decided to hold a special meeting of foreign ministers after the closing of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the German issue.

### Vietnam's French Officials Order Evacuation of Women and Children from Major Cities; Surface Calm During French-Vietnamese Negotiations; French Troop Transport Truck Ambushed Near Saigon

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 11th dispatch] During the French-Vietnamese negotiations, the atmosphere here appears superficially extremely calm. There have been no incidents between French and Vietnamese military police for two weeks. Vietnamese newspapers, regardless of their party affiliation, unanimously support the speech by the Vietnamese representative Phạm Văn Đồng, and denounce the partition of Cochinchina as an unforgivable act of aggression. French newspapers regard the Vietnamese representative's speech as a bomb thrown into the adjustment of French-Vietnamese relations, which does not contribute to friendly negotiations. Vietnamese officials here have not yet criticized the negotiations, but have ordered the evacuation of Vietnamese women and children from major cities. It is said that this is in preparation for avoiding unnecessary sacrifice in the event that the Paris negotiations fail and unfortunately, war breaks out between Vietnam and France. In recent days, many Vietnamese people have been evacuated in accordance with the order, causing slight fluctuations in the peaceful atmosphere.

### Egyptian Government Authorities Suppress Communist Party Activities; Arrest Suspects to Maintain Social Tranquility

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 11th dispatch] Egyptian Prime Minister Nuqrashi Pasha announced today that the active activities of the Communist Party in Egypt are sufficient to endanger national security, and the government will implement new laws to prohibit them. Several Communist Party publications have been ordered to cease publication.

[Reuters, Cairo, 11th dispatch] It was recently learned from high-ranking Egyptian police that Egypt is arresting Communist suspects, with approximately 160 people detained in total, including 32 in Cairo. The Egyptian government is now extremely concerned about the activities and influence of the Communist Party in Egypt. The number of unemployed people in Egypt is increasing daily, with a tendency to use the weapon of strikes. It is believed that Prime Minister Nuqrashi Pasha will consider this issue again today. It is also heard that the political department of the police station is extremely active, but there has been no development of "mass arrests."

### There are Also Plants on Mars; Soviet Astronomer Says

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 11th dispatch] The Soviet scientific community has discovered plants growing in the polar regions of Mars, as well as tall trees, which are currently under research. According to Professor Tikhov, a renowned astronomer and researcher at the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the first space explorers to reach Mars in the future will discover a type of plant identical to that on Earth. The polar regions of Mars are covered with ice and snow, similar to Earth. The "oceans" on Mars are actually plant regions. These regions are lush green in winter, like young seedlings; in summer, they turn brown, as if scorched by the sun. This view has sparked debate among other scientists, such as Professor Sharonov, who claims that these plants are affected by infrared radiation, and the photographs taken are the opposite of reality. In other words, the plants on Mars should have white leaves, which appear dark when photographed from Earth. Tikhov countered that, based on observations of various plants on Earth, plants that grow in extremely cold climates absorb infrared radiation, so they emit less infrared radiation than plants in warmer climates. He believes that in the extremely cold climate of Mars, these plants have lost the ability to emit infrared radiation.

### Armed Peasant Uprising in the Philippines; Constabulary Rushed to Luzon to Suppress It; Left-Leaning Guerrillas Number Over 30,000; President Roxas Says Peaceful Resolution is Hoped For

[United Press, Manila, 12th dispatch] The "People's Anti-Japanese Army" in central Luzon is an anti-government guerrilla force composed of armed peasants, numbering over 30,000. Central Luzon is in a constant state of terror, and the rice production in the four most densely populated provinces of Pampanga, Tarlac, Bulacan, and Nueva Ecija will be greatly affected. The "People's Anti-Japanese Army" has not yet officially responded to Roxas's statement, and clashes are currently occurring again. Before President Roxas took office, reports of clashes between the "People's Anti-Japanese Army," pro-government guerrillas, and the Philippine Constabulary were heard almost daily. There were many casualties on both sides. The army was formed shortly after the fall of Bataan, and all its weapons were taken from the battlefield, including both American and Japanese weapons. The army's leader is Taruc, 32 years old, who was the secretary of the Central Luzon Farmers' Association when the Pacific War broke out. He once held a government position, but was dismissed due to his left-leaning ideas. After the US military recovered the Philippines, he was once detained. Later, he was elected as a candidate for the Philippine House of Representatives, calling for the organization of a more democratic government and the implementation of land reform as the vice president of the Democratic Alliance.

[United Press, Manila, 11th dispatch] The strength of the Pampanga provincial government has almost doubled today. 1,000 constabulary soldiers suddenly arrived this morning in this center of peasant unrest. President Roxas issued a statement after meeting with Huk leader Taruc of Nueva Ecija today, saying that a peaceful resolution is hoped for.

### Atomic Bomb Test; Preliminary Report

Blondy Says Bomb Did Not Hit the Target

[United Press, Washington, 11th dispatch] General Compson, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Expert Committee, submitted a report to President Truman today, stating that the Bikini atomic bomb bombing test has obtained appropriate records for redesigning warships and minimizing casualties among personnel on the upper decks and decks of warships. The manpower and resources consumed in this test are justified from the perspective of the records obtained and reducing the distance of guesswork. The atomic bomb damaged more ships than any other bombing. In this test, the atomic bomb was dropped at the intended altitude toward the target ships. The intensity of the explosion was comparable to that of the previous three atomic bombs. Ships more than three-quarters of a mile from the center suffered less damage, but research on the effects of flashes and radiant energy proved that casualties among exposed personnel would be very high. Even if personnel on board were sheltered by the ship's hull and located on the shaded side of radiant energy, they would be burned immediately. As for the cost of the test, there is no reliable estimate yet.

[Agence France-Presse, Bikini Atoll, 11th dispatch] General Blondy, commander of the atomic bomb test, said that if the fourth atomic bomb had exploded directly above the battleship "Nevada," the ship would have either sunk or been completely destroyed. This statement is inconsistent with his previous statement that the atomic bomb had hit the target accurately. As for a reporter's claim that the atomic bomb exploded two seconds before the scheduled time, Blondy has denied it.

### China National Aviation Corporation Shanghai-Peiping Flight Crashes; Casualties Exceed 40; Catches Fire and Crashes Near Jinan; Chief of Flight Operations Personally Flies to Investigate This Morning

[Our Own Dispatch] The China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Peiping flight crashed and burned near Jinan Airport yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM. The plane was operating on the Shanghai-Nanjing-Qingdao-Jinan-Peiping route. The aircraft number was "15," a converted C-46 transport aircraft. Captain Shen Huade, who had extensive flying experience with the company, was the pilot, He Qizhao was the co-pilot, and Li Jun was the radio operator. It took off from Longhua Airport yesterday morning at 8:00 AM and made safe stops at Nanjing and Qingdao. It arrived at the airport outside Jinan City at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. At 4:10 PM, the plane took off from Jinan again. About ten minutes after takeoff, the left-wing engine suddenly malfunctioned. Captain Shen Huade immediately turned the plane back towards Jinan, but before it could safely land at the airport, the engine caught fire, forcing the aircraft number 15 to land in the wilderness several miles adjacent to the airport. In addition to cargo, the plane was carrying passengers. There were quite a few casualties when the accident occurred. It has been confirmed that the co-pilot and radio operator both died, and Captain Shen was seriously injured. Chen Wenkun, the chief of flight operations, personally flew to Jinan this morning at 8:00 AM to investigate the cause of the accident.

### Applause Below the Stage, Sadness in the Hearts of Those on Stage; Ma Lianliang was Interrogated Yesterday; Expresses a Clear Conscience; Bailed Out by Sun Lanting and Others to Continue Participating in Charity Performances

[Our Own Dispatch] Because the famous actor Ma Lianliang was accused of being a collaborator, the Hebei High Court, after investigation, has sealed Ma's residence in Peiping and issued an arrest warrant a few days ago. Ma's movements in Shanghai have therefore attracted attention. The Shanghai High Court received the arrest warrant the night before last and immediately sent four bailiffs to the Tianchan Theater manager's office, ordering Ma to surrender to the court yesterday morning, so that the Hebei High Court could send someone to Shanghai to take him into custody. Ma immediately expressed his intention to stop performing and surrender that night. However, those in charge of planning the charity performance to raise money for disaster relief in northern Jiangsu and Hunan, knowing that Ma had a strong appeal in the charity performance, immediately requested on his behalf that he be allowed to surrender after completing the charity performance, and Sun Liangliang and two others were responsible for guaranteeing it. Because the matter concerned a good cause, the High Court granted their request.

At around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, Ma surrendered to the High Court in Tilanqiao. The prosecutor opened a court session and questioned him. Ma said that his elderly mother and children were all in Peiping, and that he had acted with a clear conscience, and would go to Peiping after completing the charity performance. After the interrogation, he was released on bail by the original guarantors. Therefore, Ma still took to the stage at Tianchan Theater last night to raise funds for the disaster relief in northern Jiangsu and Hunan, performing "Killing the Fish" with Mei Lanfang. The audience was full and applause rose continuously.

Last night, a reporter went to the backstage of Tianchan Theater to interview Ma Lianliang and asked about his experience of going to "Manchukuo" that year. He said: In August of the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942), the Muslim Association of Shenyang, in order to raise funds for the Northeast Muslim Middle School, publicly elected Chairman Zuo Shulun to invite him to the Northeast to perform charity shows. As a Muslim, I should support the fundraising and education of my fellow Muslims. However, ever since the July 7th Incident, I had not wanted to set foot in Manchukuo, and had declined more than a dozen invitations from the Northeast. Therefore, I did not immediately agree to it. Later, a Japanese man named Sadatori, on behalf of the "Manchukuo Performing Arts Association," along with Zhu Fuchang, the president of "369 Pictorial," came to force me to sign a contract to perform commercial shows in Manchukuo. They relied on the backing of the Japanese Army Press Department and used threatening tactics. Although I declined repeatedly, I was ultimately unable to refuse. I agreed with them that after arriving in the Northeast, I would first perform charity shows for the Muslim community and then sing commercial shows. However, after arriving in Shenyang, they suddenly changed their initial agreement and insisted on performing commercial shows first. At that time, I was in an unfree environment, and I had no choice but to listen to them. So, I sang commercial shows at the Shenyang International Theater for 20 days, charity shows in Shenyang for 12 days, commercial shows at the Changchun Capital Theater for 5 days, and charity performances for the deaf school for 2 days. Finally, I performed commercial shows at the Harbin Huale Stage for 9 days, totaling 34 days of commercial shows in the Northeast. The box office was not bad, and I received a total of 80,000 yuan in bao yin (performance fees) in Manchukuo currency. This is verifiable in the Muslim Association's accounts. Therefore, the trip to the Northeast, in addition to charity performances for the Muslim community, was actually of a commercial nature, with no "cultural envoy" title, and I did not accept any appointment documents from the puppet North China government. The plays I performed were all old plays. The Japanese had previously banned national justice plays such as "Chuan Long Zhu," "Su Wu Herding Sheep," and "Si Jinshi." Therefore, in the Northeast, I never engaged in propaganda for the enemy and puppets, nor did I participate in any enemy and puppet celebrations. After the victory, I came to Shanghai from Peiping. The outside world said that I was fleeing punishment, but in reality, Shanghai was not a concession. Therefore, as soon as the charity shows for the Liyuan Guild and the scholarship fund were completed, I would return to Peiping. Ma also said that when Minister Bai went to the Northeast this time, he added support to the establishment of the Northeast Muslim Middle School, and there is a letter to prove it.

### Japanese War Criminal Major General Sato Has Been Escorted to Military Tribunal

### Puppet Ambassador Wu Kaisheng; Full of Underground Work; Submits Proof Documents

[Our Own Dispatch] Wu Kaisheng, who once served as the vice minister of the puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the puppet ambassador to Italy, was interrogated again in the High Court yesterday. Wu testified that he served in the diplomatic service before the war and then practiced law. After the war started, he engaged in relief work. After Shanghai fell, he sheltered personnel working for the Ministry of Communications and set up a secret radio station in his private residence. Later, he was discovered by the Japanese, who threatened and intimidated him. Therefore, in June of the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), he took the title of member of the Examination and Selection Committee of the puppet Examination Yuan as a cover. However, this puppet position did not have a salary. Later, Chu Minyi, the puppet Minister of Foreign Affairs, appointed him as the puppet minister to Italy without his consent, but he never went abroad. Subsequently, he was appointed as the puppet Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs without seeking his consent, but he did not take office. However, from the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937) until the victory of the War of Resistance, I had been doing underground work. This was registered with the central government. There were three or four telegrams to and from Chongqing, one of which was directly addressed to Chairman Chiang. During his tenure, he rescued arrested underground workers such as Zhu Shaoxiang and Yao Jiaozhan. He also collected intelligence for the American representative in Peiping, Fatzden. All of this has documentary proof, and it is not just empty talk. In court, the defense lawyer presented many documents, and Sun Yiying testified in court, saying that the defendant did have a relationship with the Military Statistics Bureau. The court decided to retry the case on the morning of the 18th.

### Long-Distance Telephone Lines Between Peiping and Shanghai Being Prepared for Expansion

[Our Own Dispatch] According to Yu Bingjian, director of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, to the reporter yesterday, the bureau's current equipment is far worse than before the war, but its business is more prosperous than before the war. Therefore, even with more than 2,000 employees, it is still difficult to cope. The main reason for the congestion of telegrams may be that the telegram fee is too cheap at the current prices, but the price increase is of great importance and is pending government decision. The previously planned international calls between Shanghai and New York are difficult to prepare for a while because the equipment has not been imported yet. The situation of long-distance telephone calls between Peiping and Shanghai has improved slightly, and plans are being made to add lines recently.

According to Li Pinkao, the leader of the American Airlines flight team in Shanghai, these transport planes are giant DC-4s, with a maximum cargo capacity of 20,000 pounds. However, due to the long distance, space must be reserved for fuel, so the usual load is around 16,000 pounds. Each plane has a crew of five, including the team leader, pilot, mechanic, assistant pilot, and radio operator. American Airlines transport planes first arrived in Shanghai on the 9th of this month carrying a large batch of UNRRA anti-epidemic vaccines, and returned to the United States the day before yesterday.

### "Ma Fu Baosheng" Served as an Official for Four Months: Claims He Was Just a Puppet

[Our Report] Xie Baosheng, a well-known figure in Shanghai's underworld, was once nicknamed "Ma Fu Baosheng" because he used to sell horses in the Mongolian region of Guanwai. He operated businesses such as the Xianle Dance Hall and the Kade Bathhouse in Shanghai. Although he had a wide circle of "friends" and many followers, he lacked intelligence. He was arrested after the victory because he had served as the deputy director of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Police Department in September 1943, and was once tried in the High Court. During his retrial yesterday, Xie argued that he had always been patriotic and had done a great deal of underground work. From 1937 to 1939, he had contacted the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commander and risked transporting steel bars, cement, radios, and other military supplies, and donated 500 sets of cotton uniforms to the 71st Army. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Maurice, his former English boss from his horse-selling days in Mongolia, was detained in a concentration camp, and he repeatedly provided him with supplies. Later, his work was discovered by the Japanese, so he took a puppet position as cover. After serving as an "official" for four months, he wanted to resign, but it was not approved, so he continued in a daze. However, he never attended a meeting or approved any official documents during his tenure. The director was responsible for everything, and he was just a puppet. The case was adjourned for further hearing, and the defendant remains in custody.

### Willing to "Be Stubborn to the End" for Construction: Rear Area Factory Rehabilitation Committee Hosts Press Conference to Report

Amid unprecedented industrial headwinds of foreign goods flooding in, exorbitant wages, transportation bottlenecks, heavy taxes, and currency inflation, the Rear Area Factory Rehabilitation Committee hosted its first press conference yesterday, announcing its past experiences, current plans, and future direction. Chief Secretary Xie first reported on the hardships encountered by the committee's member factories when they moved inland nine years ago, until the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the change in the economic status of the rear area, when the committee's member factories formally declared their "death." He concluded by saying that since "being stubborn" had been done for nine years, the committee should also follow through "to the end" on the country's ten-year industrial construction plan. Since January of this year, the committee has proposed a joint factory plan to quickly restart hundreds of enemy and puppet factories through joint ventures or delegated operations, but it has not been adopted. Recently, the committee has submitted this plan directly to Chairman Chiang and President Song and met with Minister Wang Yunwu. They received a reply stating that implementation measures have been drafted and are awaiting President Song's approval, and that President Song has no major objections. Following the speech, Joint Chief Secretaries Ye and Wo reported on recent work. The takeover and investigation team is about to arrive in Shanghai. Industrial departments are difficult for non-technical experts to understand, so close contact should be established with the team, and efforts should be made to rent mailbox No. 2193 as a tip box. It is hoped that all parties will provide information at any time, and the committee will send specialized engineers to conduct detailed research and investigations, and be responsible for reporting, to clarify the industrial future. The committee's office is now located at 12 Jinling East Road, and it is hoped that all sectors will provide guidance.

### Typhoon Enters Jiangxi from Fujian: (Shanghai) Spared from Attack

It is reported that the typhoon originated from 20 degrees north latitude, 125 degrees east longitude, north of Luzon Island, and began to develop at 2 p.m. on the 10th. At that time, the wind force was weak, but due to the influence of the high-pressure system in the north, the wind force increased and moved northwest.

Chief Prosecutor Quan has been working hard to investigate this case for several days, so he does not plan to hold a court investigation today, and will continue to summon and question on Monday morning at 10 a.m. It is said that there will be new developments at that time.

[Another Report] The District Procuratorate recently received a secret accusation letter accusing Railway Bureau officials of corruption, signed Zhang, but the corruption described was mostly empty words and not detailed, so the prosecutor in charge of the case summoned the person to the address, but there was no such person.

### Health Bureau Hosts Reporters for Visit to Epidemic Prevention Facilities: Over 1.3 Million People Vaccinated; Commendable Spirit of Boy Scouts at the North Station

[Our Report] At 2 p.m. yesterday, the Health Bureau hosted reporters from the city's newspapers for a visit to epidemic prevention facilities. About 30 reporters arrived and gathered in Room 209 of the Municipal Government. Director Zhang reported on the progress of recent epidemic prevention work, and then they boarded six special vehicles prepared by the bureau, led by Chen Bangxian, Director of Personnel, and Jiang Chengshi, Director of Environmental Health, and set off for the scheduled destinations.

The places visited yesterday included the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Xizang Road, the cholera epidemic area in Zhabei, the quarantine work at the North Railway Station, the Municipal First Infectious Disease Hospital on Tiantong'an Road, and Zhongshan Hospital on Fenglin Bridge. Finally, Director Zhang Wei hosted a dinner at the YMCA before dispersing.

After this visit, the reporters felt that the Health Bureau's efforts in epidemic prevention over the past month could not be denied. This was fully demonstrated by the facts seen by the reporters yesterday. In the cholera epidemic area, the Health Bureau sends personnel to spray DDT on the garbage every day, and the earthen wells used by citizens are disinfected with chlorine gas every day. More than 5,000 earthen wells have been disinfected. The disinfection of patient's homes is also taken very seriously. Whenever a case of cholera is discovered, the entire family is immediately disinfected, and vaccination teams are set up nearby to force nearby residents to be vaccinated. The Health Bureau has vaccinated 1,355,210 people, and 22,500 people were vaccinated yesterday alone. The best results were achieved at the North Station, where a total of 15,000 people can be vaccinated in one day. The service spirit of the Boy Scouts in the station is truly commendable! They half-pushed and half-pulled passengers without epidemic certificates to the vaccination station, begging you to get a shot. This kind of hard work can only be done by strong young men. But the Boy Scouts are working day and night. They do not need any remuneration. According to their unanimous statement, the only thing that pains them is the lack of cooperation from the military and police, which is just like what Director Chen said: "Chinese people have a bad habit of thinking that being able to break the rules is a sign of their superiority!" But epidemic prevention must be comprehensive, and it is hoped that all sectors can cooperate closely!

[Another Report] The Epidemic Prevention Committee announced: Yesterday there were 87 new cases of cholera and 2 deaths, bringing the total to 1792 cases and 128 deaths. According to statistics from the Health Bureau, the mortality rate of patients in this city is about 7.3%, which is much lower compared to the mortality rate of 30% for patients in Guangzhou this year.

### Shanghai Epidemic Hospital Needs Large Quantities of Salt

The Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Xizang Road has been crowded with people seeking treatment in the continuous rain. There are more than 700 people every day. On July 5th, when the weather cleared up a little, the number of patients surged. All 100 free beds were full every day. The hospital is a private charitable hospital, and due to the heavy medical work and huge expenses, the funding is extremely tight. It is hoped that people in the community will provide full assistance and generous donations. In addition, the hospital uses 1,200 pounds of saline solution every day to treat cholera patients and urgently needs a large supply of physiological saline. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will donate.

### Sichuan Province Orders All Universities to Open Additional Classes This Autumn

So That This Year's High School Graduates Can Enter University

[Special Dispatch from Chengdu] It is quite a problem for this year's high school graduates in Sichuan Province to enter university.

However, there are more than 20,000 high school graduates in Chongqing and Chengdu. The Education Department has already telegraphed Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education, asking him to find a way to accommodate them. It is reported that the Ministry of Education has issued a telegram ordering all universities in Sichuan Province to open additional classes in all departments this autumn to facilitate the entry of high school students into university.

### Overview of Education in Gansu Province: Education Funding Ranks Sixth Nationally; National Lanzhou University Scheduled to Open During Summer Vacation

Gansu is the cradle of Chinese culture and now the center of the Northwest. However, due to transportation barriers, economic difficulties, and a lack of talent, the development of education and culture has been relatively slow. With the Anti-Japanese War in progress, Gansu's position has become increasingly important. Promoting education to meet the needs of national reconstruction is a matter of utmost urgency. Mr. Tong He (Xi Gu) took office as the head of the province at this opportune moment and actively promoted education throughout the province. After eight years of effort, he was able to lay a solid foundation.

Higher Education

(A) Higher Education: Gansu originally had only one provincial college with about 50 students. In recent years, with the assistance of the provincial government, the central government successively established the National Northwest Agricultural College, the National Northwest Normal College, and the National Northwest Medical College in Gansu. The provincial Gansu College was also transferred to national status. Currently, the Northwest Agricultural College has more than 400 students, the Northwest Normal College has more than 1,000 students, the Northwest Medical College has more than 160 students, and the Gansu College has more than 300 students. This summer vacation, National Lanzhou University will be established, formed by merging and reorganizing Gansu College, Northwest Normal College, and Northwest Medical College, and will establish colleges of liberal arts, science, and engineering. In addition, to encourage graduates of secondary schools to pursue further education and cultivate various specialized talents, the Regulations for Scholarships for Gansu Students in Domestic Universities and Colleges were established. All students from this province studying at domestic universities or independent colleges will be granted scholarships by the provincial government. The amount of these scholarships has been increasing year by year, and the number of students receiving scholarships has also been increasing year by year, from 54 in the 27th year to 782 in the 34th year, an increase of about 15 times.

Secondary Education

(B) Secondary Education: In the past, secondary schools in Gansu were concentrated in a few cities such as Pingliang, Tianshui, and Lintao, with uneven distribution. The funding for schools in the provincial capital and other counties also varied greatly, with no standard. In the winter of the 27th year, when Mr. Zheng took office, he immediately established a standard for the staffing and budget of secondary schools. The funding for schools in other counties was increased year by year. By the 31st year, all secondary schools in the province were receiving their full allocation according to the standard, eliminating the past problem of uneven distribution and emphasizing the east. Regarding the establishment of new schools and classes, a plan for district-based school expansion and grade increases was formulated. The province was divided into ten middle school and normal school districts: Lanzhou, Lintao, Tianshui, Pingliang, Longxi, Wuwei, Jiuquan, Qingyang, Linxia, and Wudu; and four vocational school districts: Lanzhou, Longnan, Sui Dong, and Hexi. Schools were established year by year in districts with fewer schools or no schools at all, and the number of classes was also increased year by year. The increase in the number of schools, grades, and students over the past seven years is as follows: (27th year) 15 middle schools, 68 grades, 3,103 students; 14 normal schools, 66 grades, 2,523 students; 5 vocational schools, 24 grades, 708 students. (34th year) 59 middle schools, 367 grades, 3,547 students; 23 normal schools, 188 grades, 6,709 students; 15 vocational schools, 95 grades, 2,675 students. Middle schools have developed the fastest, followed by normal schools, with fewer vocational schools being established.

Elementary Education

(C) National Education: The total number of school-age children in Gansu Province is approximately 700,000. According to statistics from the 27th year, only about 150,000 children were enrolled in school, with about 80% of school-age children out of school. After seven years of effort, 825 central national schools have been established, reaching the standard of one school per township. 6,725 protected national schools have been established, with 500 protected areas still without schools, which are scheduled to be established in the 35th year. All central schools and national schools have raised sufficient funds in accordance with regulations since the 30th year. Excluding over-age children, approximately 49% of school-age children in the province have been enrolled in school. Furthermore, adult literacy education is being gradually promoted. For example, national schools in various counties of the Longdong Special Education District have universally established adult education classes. (D) Social Education: Gansu has established four provincial-level people's education halls and one provincial library. Each county has established people's education halls with the exception of a few remote counties. National physical education has also been actively promoted. Every year on Double Tenth Day, sports events are held in various districts throughout the province. Other forms of education, such as broadcasting education and film education, have also been planned and implemented. During the Anti-Japanese War, although the province faced difficult conditions, the education cause was able to develop rapidly, partly due to the efforts of education personnel and partly due to a substantial increase in funding. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, the province's education funding ranked only 18th among all provinces, but it has now risen to 6th place. If calculated by population and the multiple of funding increase, it ranks first among all provinces.

### Representatives of the Municipal Elementary School Teachers' Association Negotiated Expenses with the Education Bureau Yesterday

July Salaries and Allowances Must Wait for Municipal Government Notification

### Opening Day at Hongkou Swimming Pool

[Our Newspaper Report] The Hongkou Swimming Pool, eagerly awaited by the citizens, opened yesterday. To avoid overcrowding and inconvenience, there were no opening ceremonies or performances yesterday. A reporter made a special trip to visit in the light rain yesterday afternoon.

The water was so clean it looked blue. There were only a few dozen people in the pool, about half of whom were foreigners. The desolate scene was not as good as in previous years, probably due to the rain, the cool weather, and the fact that the public was not yet aware that it had opened. There was no loud noise in the men's changing room, and no ladies in colorful swimsuits to add color to the opening day.

It is said that the water filtration system has been completely repaired, so the water can be kept clean for a long time without frequent changes. The capacity of the pool is 3.2 million gallons, and the water cost is about 1.8 million yuan. There will also be a snack bar next to the pool to provide food and drinks for swimmers.

Perhaps we think the ticket price is a bit high, so we might as well hope for hot weather. When it's hot, there will be crowds, and more tickets can be sold, and maybe the price will be reduced.

### Implementation Measures for Promoting Cleanliness Zones

District Bao-Jia Personnel Should Work Actively

The Shanghai Municipal Implementation Measures for Promoting the Cleanliness Zone System were passed by the 38th Municipal Council Meeting yesterday. A brief summary is as follows: (1) These measures are specifically formulated to promote the function of citizen autonomy and to promote cleanliness both indoors and outdoors. (2) The purpose of these measures and the division of responsibilities are as follows:

1.  To strive for orderliness and cleanliness indoors, with Bao-Jia chiefs urging residents to make efforts to comply.
2.  To strive for cleanliness within the alleyways, with Bao-Jia chiefs assigning alleyway residents to elect a cleanliness worker or disciplinarian to be responsible for maintaining cleanliness: supervising alleyway watchmen to sweep and clean at all times. Each alleyway should also provide its own trash cans or bins, placed in appropriate locations. Every morning, the alleyway watchmen should move the trash cans or bins to the alleyway entrance on the street, so that the garbage trucks can dump the trash into the trucks. The trucks will then remove the trash or transport it to a transfer point.
3.  To strive for cleanliness on the streets (including major and minor streets), the cleaning corps will be equipped with one platoon per district (or one squad in suburban areas) based on the size of the area and the population, and will be supervised by the district office, with police, health bureaus, and the cleaning corps providing tiered supervision. Street sweepers will be assigned to specific sections, and street trash will be removed. The garbage in the existing street trash cans and bins will also be removed by the respective cleaning teams; however, broken bricks and soil generated from repairing houses should be removed by the owners themselves. In addition, the sludge generated from dredging rivers should be transported away by the owners or the units undertaking the project.
4.  To remove accumulated garbage, garbage is a breeding ground for flies. At this time of epidemic, it is urgent to remove it in districts and phases to emphasize cleanliness and facilitate epidemic prevention. All accumulated garbage in each district must be investigated by each district office by July 14th of the 35th year, estimating the tonnage and reporting directly to the Environmental Sanitation Department of the Health Bureau in order to plan for unified removal, organize by district, and complete within a time limit. Garbage piles that can ferment and cause flies to breed should be removed first. In order to expedite matters, the preliminary phased garbage removal plan is as follows: First week: West District, Central District, South District (July 16th to 22nd); Second week: Zhabei District, North District, East District (July 23rd to 29th); Third week: Nanshi District, Huxi District (July 30th to August 5th); Regarding the above items 1 and 2, the Bao can be the center, and each Bao can convene a temporary Bao-Min Congress to formulate cleanliness covenants. Regarding the above items 3 and 4, the district office can be the center, and the district chief can convene a Bao-Jia chief meeting to jointly discuss implementation methods.

(3) In order to promote the Cleanliness Zone System to the fullest extent, the Health Bureau should, in accordance with the Municipal Government's decision, invite responsible persons from relevant agencies to form the Shanghai Cleanliness Design Management Committee, the organization of which will be formulated separately.

(4) In order to review and improve cleanliness matters, the Health Bureau may, in conjunction with the Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Department, convene district chief meetings, and Bao-Jia chiefs may be designated to attend. (5, 6, 7: Omitted)

### Change of District Chief in the Fourth District

### District Bao Staff - Serving as District People's Representatives

-Must Choose One to Resign-

All district people's representatives in this city have been elected. However, some hold positions as staff in district offices and Bao secretaries. The municipal government believes that while district office staff and Bao secretaries are autonomous personnel, they are responsible for handling daily internal affairs, and serving concurrently as district people's representatives would hinder their primary work. Based on Article 2 of the County Councilors Election Regulations and Item 3 of the Unified Interpretation of the Executive Yuan, they may not serve concurrently as district people's representatives. Those who have been elected should choose one to resign and report to the Ministry of Interior for approval. Yesterday, a telegram from the Ministry of Interior (Ministry of Interior 5 Grey) approved the record.

### The 18th and 26th Districts Establish District People's Representative Assemblies

### Plan to Organize a Commercial Arbitration Association to Promote Trade Between China and the United States: Li Ming and Carson Nominated as Chairmen

[Our Newspaper Report] According to Ms. Shi Fanglan, the China representative of the Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Advancement Association, the two countries are currently researching the organization of an arbitration committee for commercial disputes between the two countries to handle all difficulties and disputes that arise in Sino-American trade. She said that recently, the chairman of the Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Advancement Association, Mr. Fu'aser, delivered a speech on this matter at the banquet of the American Commercial Arbitration Association. He believed that the establishment of a Sino-American commercial arbitration mechanism would promote friendly commercial relations between the two countries and predicted that the future development of the mechanism would be extremely bright. Historically, Chinese commerce and personal relationships have attached great importance to the spirit of arbitration. Today, the spirit of arbitration is even more important in Chinese commercial, labor, and maritime relations. The first Chinese arbitration regulation was promulgated in 1921 by the Ministry of Justice of the Beijing government, and the regulation was re-examined and approved in 1935 by the Ministry of Industry of the National Government. In addition, China's Commercial Association Law, Labor Law, etc., have detailed provisions for arbitration, so China already has a foundation for arbitration measures in various commercial aspects. Now that the United States has long abandoned extraterritorial rights in China, American businessmen operating in China are subject to Chinese law. However, since the establishment of a new relationship between foreign businessmen and Chinese law, there may be occasional trade disputes, and purely judicial handling may inevitably lead to delays. Therefore, in order to accelerate the resolution of possible commercial disputes between China and the United States, business leaders from both countries should be selected to form a Sino-American Commercial Dispute Arbitration Committee. According to the American Commercial Arbitration Association, in early 1945, the association accepted a request from the US State Department to provide a memorandum, suggesting that a commercial dispute arbitration mechanism should be established in the commercial relationship between China and the United States to handle all possible difficulties or disputes. The proposal was also submitted to the Chinese government for approval, and six leading figures from Chinese banking and commerce were designated to form a delegation to the United States to discuss with twenty leaders from the American business community appointed by the association to promote the organization of a mutually beneficial Sino-American commercial arbitration mechanism. It is learned that Mr. Li Ming of our country and Mr. Carson of the United States have been nominated as chairmen of the organizing committee. The committee is currently planning to establish this arbitration mechanism as soon as possible and is actively drafting all relevant rules and regulations. It is learned that Mr. Wang Renweidun, the international public relations officer of the American Commercial Arbitration Association, will visit China soon to plan for the establishment of the arbitration mechanism in China.

### Gold and Silver: Accelerated Gold Flow, Undecided U.S. Silver Price

[Reuters, Washington, 12th dispatch] World gold is currently moving at an accelerated pace towards several free markets (partly from unexpected sources such as the Bank of England). In some situations, this movement of gold may accelerate further. Significant changes in the U.S. gold reserves are also becoming possible. However, London gold industry figures do not want this gold to flow to India. As for silver, millions upon millions of taels will still flow to China within a few years, it is said.

The Senate previously suggested a compromise on Wednesday to set the silver price at $0.903 per ounce. Yesterday, the House of Representatives voted to reject it. The House insists on setting the silver price at $0.7111 per ounce.

### Yarn Prices Steady, Cotton Fabric Weak

Yesterday, the yarn market was relatively stable. Initially, Shuang Ma yarn (Double Horse yarn) was quoted slightly higher, but it returned to 1.29 million at the close. Medium and small-sized yarns, especially those with the "Red Cai" and "Two Kui Stars" brands, were most actively traded, with prices about 10,000 higher than the previous day. Double-ply thread was bought up, with prices rising 20,000, showing strong support. At noon, the Fang Jian Company (Spinning & Construction Company) as usual posted prices for open-end yarn, which were similar to those marked on Wednesday, without much change.

Grey cloth turned soft again because the actual demand was not smooth. At the same time, the Fang Jian Company continued to supply it on the previous day, so people's mood was tired. However, the 3A Cai Qiu (Colorful Ball) fine cloth still saw strong demand in the north and remained firm. The rest generally fell by 500 to 750.

Yesterday, New York American cotton telegraph, rose again by 29 to 37 points. The spot price of near-term cotton was 33.8 U.S. dollars, the forward price was 34.1 U.S. dollars, and the spot price of middling was 34.56 U.S. dollars. The local cotton spot market was purely affected by the continuous rise in American cotton. People holding goods became more reluctant to sell, resulting in a slight decrease in trading volume. It is said that only Nantong Dasheng and Wuxi Qingfeng yarn factories slightly purchased.

### Taiwan Sugar Postpones Tender

Rumors Say Prices May Fall Slightly

The sixth phase of Taiwan Sugar Company's Taiwan sugar tender was originally scheduled to be held yesterday. However, because the various procedures of the previous phase have not yet been completed, and sugar merchants have sufficient sugar stocks, and the retail stores also do not lack sugar, the company decided to postpone it for three days, setting it for next Monday. As for the tender price, it has also been decided to ensure that the sugar price gradually falls slightly.

### Mayor Wu Instructs Rice Merchants Not to Refuse to Sell Rationed Rice, Otherwise, Licenses Will Be Revoked; Milling Brown Rice into White Rice is Also Not Permitted

Yesterday, Mayor Wu summoned Mr. Qu Zhenhua, the representative of the city's Rice Merchants Association, and was extremely angered by the refusal of various rice shops in the city to sell rationed rice. He verbally instructed Mr. Qu to tell all rice shops that if they again refused to sell rationed rice by making excuses and violating regulations, their licenses would be revoked. Mr. Qu then made some statements regarding the city government's method of requiring advance payment for rationed rice. According to Mayor Wu, if the rice shops have difficulties paying for rationed rice in advance, the Rice Industry Association should submit a request to the city government for approval. Within a possible range, the city government will provide assistance.

The Grain Price Review Committee held its fifth regular meeting yesterday. The meeting decided: (1) the price of white rice will remain unchanged as previously assessed, and (2) the proposals made by rice merchants at the fourth regular meeting regarding paying for rationed rice after it is sold and selling brown rice milled into white rice, except that the first item has been submitted to the mayor for decision, regarding the sale of brown rice milled into white rice, the Bureau of Social Affairs, in order to avoid a few rice profiteers milling brown rice into white rice and passing it off as high-quality white rice for sale, decided not to discuss it. Furthermore, the arrival of goods at the north and south rice markets yesterday was relatively sparse, with 534 piculs arriving at the south rice market and 1,776 piculs arriving at the north rice market, and 1,777 piculs and 45 packages were self-transported and sold, totaling 4,088 piculs and 45 packages. Rice is widely available for public sale at rice shops throughout the city.

A small number of rice shops also received and sold subsidized rice yesterday. The Bureau of Social Affairs stipulates that the daily quantity of low-price rice sold should be 5,000 piculs and will try to increase it if necessary.

### Keemun Black Tea Under Negotiation, Local Sales Quite Active

Regarding tea, the shops and tea firms on this street are still actively stocking up due to the current peak tea season, and transactions are unusually active, but prices are generally stable. As for the foreign firm tea market, the negotiations between the British company Concord Foreign Firm and those holding Keemun aged black tea have shown slight progress in recent days, but no formal agreement has been reached. It is said that the price being discussed is only around 90,000 per dan.

### Yangquan White Coal Will Arrive, Kaiping Slack Coal Extremely Sluggish

Regarding the coal market, news of the arrival of white coal has been heard. 500 tons of Yangquan white coal are expected to arrive in Shanghai in about a week. However, the market remains slightly firm due to recent low inventories and hoarding by cargo owners. High-grade bituminous coal lump is also continuing to rise in price due to shortages. However, Kaiping No. 2 seam coal is still sluggish, and prices have fallen below the allocated price. The reason is that the supply of fuel coal along the Longhai and Pukou areas is relatively difficult, while the factories in Shanghai are depressed, and factory sales are extremely sluggish. Therefore, those who previously handled coal from East China and Huainan transported it to Pukou, where it was purchased by the Fuel Management Committee and paid to the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee for Kaiping No. 2 seam coal certificates to be delivered in Pudong at 80% of the price, thus further increasing oversupply.

### Promoting Tea Exports, Providing Low-Interest Loans

Specific Measures Under Negotiation

Tea faces difficulties in export trade due to high costs. The Central Bank plans to provide export loans and has been in discussions with tea merchants for several days. The plan is that tea merchants can pledge overseas customer credit drafts obtained based on overseas orders sold. The bank will only charge tea merchants low interest to help tea merchants circulate funds, without having to wait for the goods to be shipped and paid for, hoping to reduce costs.

### Economic Briefs

Caustic Soda: It is heard that another 2,000+ barrels of caustic soda transferred from Hong Kong arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The market price yesterday was 410,000. Purchases from outside the city are extremely rare and the price has a tendency to decline again.

Celluloid: In recent months, the Shanghai market has been flooded with glassware, all marked as newly arrived American goods. It is now heard that these glass products are mostly manufactured by foreigners of a certain country using celluloid. Celluloid sales are now very good, with wholesale prices ranging from 6,000 to 8,000 per pound.

Hard Lead: After the war, large quantities of American goods (4X hard lead) were shipped to China. Later, the American side heard that a certain country was absorbing it at high prices and immediately prohibited exports. It is said that the hard lead contains a major metal component, which, after refining, can be used to manufacture military equipment. The usage in Shanghai has not decreased, and the inventory is decreasing daily, causing the market price to be twice as high as before.

### Refined White Sugar Thrown on the Market and Sold for US$18.75 Per 100 Pounds

The sugar market was initially stable yesterday and then weakened. The Guild's first-class white granulated sugar from the disk opening was 97,000 to 96,500, 96,000, 95,500 to 94,000 in the afternoon, a small decrease of 3,000 before and after. Wenzhou's medium granulated sugar was only 90,000, warehouse receipts 92,000 to 90,500, 90,000. Half-cars of white sugar were 170,000, three-and-a-half cars of white sugar were 147,000, raw granulated sugar 100,200 to 101,000, later 97,000, a small decrease of 5,000. Goods from the Chaozhou-Guangdong group were offered at 100,500 for cotton red sugar, 80,000 to 79,000 for Huanggang Qing sugar, with a hundred or so bags sold. Goods from the Jian group opened at several dozen bags of Diao Qing sugar for 79,000. Xinghua red sugar was 98,000 to 96,000. It is heard that Peruvian refined white sugar has been thrown on the market and sold for US$18.75 per 100 pounds, excluding taxes, for shipping in July, August, and September.

### Financial Markets Quite Stable

Demand for Hong Kong Notes Very Strong Yesterday; Foreign Stocks Mostly Cashed Out at High Prices

Raw Silk: Remained stable yesterday, with limited trading and slight fluctuations. After the opening, it hovered around 1.94 million. At 10:00, the Central Bank distributed 70 bars at a price of 1.94 million, at which point it became even more stable. Around noon, it rose slightly from 1.93 million, but did not exceed 1.95 million. The afternoon remained stable, with slightly higher asking prices, resulting in a slight increase of 5,000 compared to the previous close. Gold jewelry was 1.06 million, silver bullion 1,800, silver dollars 1,380, there was supply, and the informal interbank lending market remained loose, with interest rates around 1.5%.

Foreign currencies: U.S. dollars remained peaceful, ranging from 2,530 to 2,570 in the morning, only a distance of 40. At noon, it was around 2,550. There were no major changes in the afternoon. The gold market reported higher, showing a slight improvement. The results were slightly down 15 compared to the previous close. There was a strong demand for Hong Kong notes, resulting in a good increase of 10. Due to the influence of the U.S. Congress making a final decision on Anglo-American loans, Anglo-American foreign exchange was generally sold short, resulting in this. Hong Kong exchange rate 545 to 555, Indian exchange rate 670 had sellers, British exchange rate 8,700 to 8,900, US exchange rate still lacked changes.

Government Bonds: Gradually became hazy, with fluctuating supply and demand. Unified Class C bonds retreated from 950 in the early morning to 780, hovering around 850 near noon, resulting in a decrease of 120 compared to the previous close. Class A, B, and D also fell by 140, Class E was relatively flat, with only a slight decrease of 90.

Chinese Stocks: Large stocks still showed improvement, while small stocks still felt weak. The market was firm at first and then flat. The highest prices in the early morning were Yongsha 505, Meiya 3050, Jingfu 180, Xinguang 200, and Qinxing 155. The weakest prices midway were Yongsha 475, Meiya 2780, Jingfu 160, Xinguang 180, and Qinxing 140, only hovering near noon, resulting in Yongsha and Meiya still rising slightly compared to the previous close, Jingfu falling slightly, and Xinguang Qinxing flat. In the unpopular middle-sized stocks, there were slight increases, while small-sized stocks had limited increases and decreases due to inconsistent supply and demand. The three old stocks rebounded slightly.

Foreign Stocks: Rose slightly and fell back. Holders cashed out at high prices. Before the listing of stocks on the exchange, those engaged in foreign stocks are inevitably uneasy. Yisha retreated from 8,400 to 7,500, and then turned around, resulting in Yisha and Huide, the British Union Steel falling by slightly less than half a percent, and the Paper Industry, Asian Beer falling by slightly more than half a percent. Ye Guang was flat.

### Our Country's Relief Obtained from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA)

— This Newspaper's Information Office

After the extreme destruction of the war, there must be a period of recovery and restoration. With much land laid to waste and people struggling on the brink of death, the recovery work must have a fundamental starting point. To launch this post-war relief and recovery effort, forty-four allied nations signed an agreement on November 9, 1943, establishing the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.

China supported the war for the longest time and suffered the most damage, so its hope for relief is also the most urgent. The Executive Yuan formed a Survey and Design Committee, which, with the assistance of international experts, completed a report estimating that our post-war relief and recovery needs totaled US$2.5 billion and 2.7 billion pre-war purchasing power of legal tender. But we requested US$945 million from UNRRA, with the remainder to be raised by China itself.

China's Post-War Relief and Recovery Needs and Requests to UNRRA

Total Needs (Thousands of Units) | Requested From UNRRA (Thousands of Units)
---|---
Relief Item | Expenses (National Currency) | Supplies (Thousands of Units) | Supplies | Percentage
3,271 | 1,254
Food | 100,000 | 316,840 | 153,881 | 16.3
1,098 | 145
Clothing | 150,000 | 979,305 | 154,919 | 16.4
1,050 | 50
Housing | 100,000 | 25,000 | 1,000 | 5.0
74 | 74
Medicine | 246,515 | 66,004 | 66,004 | 7.0
3,397 | 1,606
Transportation | 430,964 | 663,017 | 350,120 | 54.9
759 | 663
Agriculture | 206,700 | 86,350 | 77,476 | 8.2
564 | 189
Industry | 1,153,500 | 348,550 | 115,000 | 12.2
12 | 9
Pan-Regional Relief | 139,570 | 6,500 | 4,500 | 0.5
27 | 27

1 | 1
Refugees | 39,098 | 5,633 | 5,633 | 0.6
10,233 | 4,018
Total | 2,727,164 | 2,529,677 | 945,046 | 100.0

The above quantity of supplies is in metric tons.

The above value of supplies is in US dollars.

In addition, we requested UNRRA to send more than 2,000 foreign experts, 55% of whom were to restore transportation and agricultural industry and 45% of whom were to handle direct relief work. The above figures are only 37% of what our country needs, with the remaining 63% to be raised by China itself. In addition, administrative expenses of 2.7277 billion must be raised. China also established the Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, abbreviated as "Xingzong," under the Executive Yuan. UNRRA also established a China office to cooperate with Xingzong.

The amount of relief China requested from UNRRA was already reduced to the minimum. It was confidently considered to be fair, but the amount UNRRA considered allocating to China was not as substantial as ideally hoped. The Xingzong released a public statement on December 26, 1945, stating that a total of 90,000 tons of supplies had been received. UNRRA China Office Director Kayser declared on May 10, 1946, that 413,395 tons of relief supplies had arrived in Shanghai in string, 128,000 tons for other departments, and 119,671 tons were en route. According to the statement released by Zheng Binnan, director of Xingzong's US office (January 28, 1946, in Shanghai), the relief supplies our country received were too small compared to other countries! (See table below)

Country | Amount of Relief Received (USD) | Average Distribution Per Person (USD)
---|---
Albania | 25,000,000 | 22.42
Austria | 75,000,000 | 11.54
Belarus | 50,000,000 | 3.30
Czechoslovakia | 20,000,000 | 16.56
Greece | 37,500,000 | 52.46
Italy | 40,900,000 | 9.32
Poland | 440,000,000 | 19.37
Yugoslavia | 158,000,000 | 2.13
China | 560,000,000 | 1.25

Although the absolute number looks not small, given China's vast disaster areas and large number of refugees, this huge number is not enough and the proportion is too small.

What is particularly disappointing to us is UNRRA's relief for our country, especially regarding food. Since China's eight-year War of Resistance, people's lives have been unbearable. And the autumn harvests of 1945 and 1946 decreased. In Hunan, known as a rice-producing area, less than one-third of the land was cultivated. The Yellow River flood zone in Henan also could not be cultivated. In other war zones such as Guangxi, Hubei, and Jiangxi, as well as the so-called Communist-liberated areas such as northern Jiangsu, Shandong, Shanxi, and the Northeast, people all felt impoverished. The disaster area was vast, including eighteen provinces, with 40 million people in urgent need of relief. However, due to severe famine occurring around the world, the amount of food allocated to China was minimal. When Hoover came to China to provide disaster relief, he proposed to UNRRA that the relief goods arriving in China be increased by 200,000 tons per month (including May, June, July, August, and September), but UNRRA only agreed to transport 870,000 tons within five months. At the same time, due to our country's lack of transportation and the dilapidated state of its seaports, the relief supplies could not be quickly transported to the disaster areas, which is also regrettable.

Xingzong's principle is to improve the situation in the disaster area within two years, and at the same time, to replace relief with post-war construction, taking the opportunity to promote industrialization. Its work is divided into handling emergency relief, restoring transportation, improving agriculture, constructing medical administration, and stabilizing finance. Xingzong handles goods by distributing them free of charge to relieve poor people, selling them at fair prices, and selling part of the materials to cover administrative expenses. Doing charity work is inherently difficult. Director-General Jiang has repeatedly stated that staff must be honest and law-abiding. Even so, they will still be subject to criticism.

UNRRA Director LaGuardia announced on July 9 that the shipment of agricultural and industrial equipment to China would be suspended, saying it was based on a joint complaint by more than 300 foreign staff members of UNRRA's China office. The points of complaint are: (1) China has failed to quickly distribute relief supplies to refugees and has used them as a political tool, and (2) the Chinese government does not provide Xingzong's expenses, causing the relief supplies to be sold, depriving countless starving people of the food they need. Our government issued a statement on the 11th, and Director-General Jiang explained this to reporters on the 12th. It is hoped that the UNRRA Director-General will understand the real situation in China and will be able to resume the work of shipping materials to China as usual.

### The Eighth Air Force Group's Trip to Tokyo (II)

— Zhu Minwei

The first American military radio station within Japan that the plane contacted was Fukuoka. The Fukuoka radio station gave us worry and also gave us trust. The weather within Japan was good after all, and there wouldn't be any more difficulties. After Fukuoka, everyone ate cigarettes and candies. The four girls desperately gave bread and cakes to the passengers. I also thought about the real combat situation, where there cannot be female crew members. The reason is that men are strong and can act like beasts to fight. If there are women in the plane, it will distract the men to protect them. So, if the plane were to go into combat, these four girls' actions of handing out cakes and candies would cause disgust and distract the aircrew. But this flight was different. I saw everyone eating a little chocolate candy, especially Xu Shulin. He was like a liaison officer, managing the entire plane up and down, front and back, constantly needing to pay attention and work. When offered candy during his busy schedule, he immediately responded with a smile and gratitude, while gesturing. Chen Gongmao was different. He needed to stay alert, searching the ether for the radio waves of the American military radio station in order to learn about the weather report for the journey ahead. Sometimes, he had to stimulate the American military radio station by pressing his transmitter key, so his eyes were looking at circles of radio waves, and his ears were listening to "di-di-da" tones. He valued not wanting to eat anything, only hoping to not lose contact.

After passing Osaka, at 2:40, we saw Mount Fuji appear to the left. The clouds capped the lower realm, but the black body of Mount Fuji emerged from the clouds, its peak covered in white clouds. Seeing Mount Fuji meant that it was only fifteen minutes away from the Atsugi Airport in Tokyo. Before seeing Mount Fuji, Captain Wang directed the plane to fly to the right, which was his cautiousness due to old age. At 2:45, we were on the sea of Tokyo Bay. We were all happily pleased to be able to fly on time. Except for Chief Zhu, who had been to Tokyo before, everyone on the plane was visiting for the first time. The driver's seat could be like two main guests sitting in a special car enjoying the scenery outside the car window, calmly enjoying Tokyo Bay below. We, who were riding on the plane, were sitting squeezed in the small cabin, and to see Tokyo Bay, we had to squeeze to the small glass window to look out. Xu Shulin saw that the front upper turret seat was empty, so he beckoned to him. I climbed up. This was a semi-circular glass ball for rearward vigilance. I turned sideways and looked forward. Tokyo Bay was as I imagined it, similar to a shallow beach embracing a line, and further ahead was the land. The sea water was still gray and calm without waves, but the small islands were clearly visible. There was not a single boat or dock, this was a purely natural area. It was here that Japan was intimidated by the earthquake, established coastal fortresses, and finally opened its doors again and surrendered. Tokyo Bay became calm here.

Our plane flew straight towards Mount Fuji, and after landing, we saw a high platform between the Yamada River in Japan, with a yellow, bare color, on which many neatly arranged planes were placed. Our plane flew straight to that airport without hesitation. When I looked from afar, I thought it was a small airport. Only when I looked closely did I know that it was very wide. In the rectangular scene, there was a black runway. The planes arranged on all sides were colorful and countless. There were all kinds of styles. This was truly a demonstration of military power. From the single-engine Mustang, to the twin-engine P88 reconnaissance plane on the aircraft body, to the same type of black P67 Black Widow night monitoring plane, B25, B24, C54, C46, all kinds of aircraft were available.

### Small Farmer Fortresses Gradually Being Established

The airplane landed on the black asphalt runway, and near the end, there was a taxiway turning to the left. A small jeep, with a sign painted on the back that read "Follow Me" and a yellow flag stuck next to the driver. Our massive sea whale obediently followed this small jeep, taxiing and taxiing. I saw many airplanes being repaired in the hangars outside the taxiway. American soldiers sitting at the entrances of the hangars shielded their eyes from the glaring sunlight with their hands on their hat brims, observing this newly arrived fat fellow. Americans live amidst numerous things; every day, their time and energy are spent accepting stimuli and working. Their straightforward character is greatly related to gaining fresh stimulation from living in flowing water.

After we got off the plane, we felt how hot Atsugi Airport was. The Americans who came to greet Commander Zhu Shiming and the delegation members left one after another in vehicles. Battalion Commander Wang was still waiting for Xu Shulin to pack up the plane and assist the American military in refueling the plane, which held two thousand eight hundred gallons of fuel (sixty large barrels). The Americans did not pay attention to any formalities; they used a fuel truck to refuel the plane, without even requiring a signature. What a magnanimous national spirit! I thought, only those who have interacted with them would feel this.

After we finished packing up the plane, we took two cars into the city. The driver was a middle-aged Japanese man wearing a green serge suit and a soft white hat, named Kanatani Takashi. He had a kind and gentle face, spoke in a soft tone, and his movements were respectful. He said that Captain Liu had also taken his car last time and has now returned to Chongqing. The Japanese are so confused, not understanding that the Chinese government has long since moved back to Nanjing. The last time Captain Liu Shanben came, he has now returned to his country, and the Japanese still remember these things so respectfully, always placing the Chinese in a highly regarded position in their minds. From this point, we felt that coming to Tokyo, everywhere we would suffer the white eyes of the Japanese, although this is an overestimation.

The car traveled on the highway from Atsugi to Tokyo. This road was lined with farmland and villages, densely populated. Xu Shulin said to Huang Eryi: This is simply the scenery of the countryside of Chengdu, Sichuan. The farming in the fields, like in China, is done by hand, planting taro, rice, and wheat piece by piece. It was already approaching evening, and Japanese women and children in the fields were digging mud or weeding. On the highway, Japanese men pushed small carts transporting some wood, sweating as they progressed through the dust. Besides planting food crops in the fields, barren land was always densely covered with pine forests. Wooden houses and small bungalows nestled close to the forest. The scenery did not show that this place had been through war. Especially near the small rivers, seeing Japanese children playing in the water and old people fishing with rods made me, coming from China, envious and sad. Japan was defeated, but its people were relieved of the task of bloodshed and could strive for improvement in clothing, food, and housing. We won, but our people are still wearing military uniforms and firing guns, or are displaced.

On the road from Atsugi to Tokyo, all we saw was a scene of national peace and prosperity. In the Japanese countryside, there were few signs of war. Perhaps the most noticeable thing was that there were fewer men, because many soldiers from the Japanese countryside died in the wars from Guadalcanal to the Ryukyu Islands. And many strong young men also died when the major Japanese cities were bombed. But since the Japanese have already settled down, those who died are dead, and the living naturally have to be busy eating and living well. The Allied forces' economic policies towards Japan struck at the control and bloodsucking of financial capital forces over the rural areas. The damage inflicted by the big bloodsuckers has disappeared in the Japanese countryside. A stable and prosperous small farmer fortress will be gradually established and enriched. That scenery is even more remarkable.

### Northern Jiangsu Refugees Demand to Return Home

Some time ago, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Tang visited Jieyang and addressed the refugees, saying that a decision had been made to send you back home, so please be patient (this was during the 15-day ceasefire period). On the 29th of last month, Director Xue of Xuzhou, at a welcoming meeting for Minister Gu, instructed the heads of party and government in various counties to organize the refugees from that day onwards and prepare to return home at any time. Now that the ceasefire period has expired and passed, there has been no response. Moreover, the declaration of Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai, regarding the conditions proposed by our government, not only said that they were not satisfied with them, but also called them unreasonable demands. His arrogant attitude is infuriating, and he clearly denied that the Communist army would withdraw from northern Jiangsu, indicating that they could not consider or accept the withdrawal of troops and political power from northern Jiangsu, Rehe, and other places. This resolute tone indicates an intention to occupy northern Jiangsu for a long time. Their lack of sincerity in seeking peace is already obvious. However, the national economy and people's livelihood cannot be delayed any longer, which is recognized by people across the country. If the government is determined to rescue the countless refugees, seeing this terrible situation of deep water and scorching fire, there should be emergency measures. It is hoped that the government will fulfill its promise to send us back home, to maintain its credibility and appease the public (Representatives of refugees from various counties in exile in Yangzhou: Qi Cheng, Zheng Yi, Qi Shuxiang, Jin Mingxin).

Short Story

### White-Clad Angel

— Zhong Yuan

It seems that since that time, I exchanged a few letters with Mei Qi. But it can be said that it was entirely for "fun," simply treating him as a child and joking with him. I also sent him a photo of myself, but it was just for fun, certainly not to keep as a memento.

Later, because a group of older, bad students at Xiguang Middle School were spreading rumors about me, I stopped joking with Mei Qi.

After about three or four years, I had left school. I once again met an old classmate from Mei Qi's hometown. She told me that Mei Qi's parents had both passed away, and he was no longer studying. He was learning to be a laboratory technician at a hospital. She also said that the boy was still very glib and was pursuing a nurse at the hospital who was two or three years older than him, named Xu Xiangying. The two were about to get engaged.

After hearing the news from that classmate, I smiled faintly and soon forgot about it.

It wasn't until a few years after the outbreak of the war that I vaguely heard some news about Mei Qi again. I learned that he had gone to the interior to study with someone. His fiancée, Xu Xiangying, did not go and was working as a nurse at a major hospital in Beiping, and was very successful, etc.

Thinking of this, looking at that commemorative album, I almost laughed out loud.

Everything was clear and bright: She was Xu Xiangying. She had found my photo in Mei Qi's broken box, saw my name, and kept it firmly in her mind, thinking that I was some old flame of Mei Qi's.

Turning off the lamp, I breathed a long sigh in the dim moonlight, silently thinking about how to explain this misunderstanding to Xu Xiangying the next day.

But by the next afternoon, Xu Xiangying still hadn't come to my room. After asking around, I learned that she was the newly appointed night shift head nurse, sleeping during the day and getting up to work only at night. So I waited anxiously until night. Sure enough, after the night was quiet, she came again. However, she didn't wait for me to explain, just gave me a mysterious and terrifying smile, asked, "How are you?" and took the commemorative album from beside my pillow, quietly walking out.

After that, she did this almost every night, not giving me a chance to explain, just giving me a mysterious and terrifying smile and leaving.

"Is a woman's heart so narrow?" I almost forgot that I was a woman, and I began to feel somewhat indignant.

But just then, many idle words were spread from the mouths of some young nursing students. They said that Xu Xiangying sent an airmail letter to her fiancé every day; that two-thirds of her monthly salary was remitted to her fiancé as tuition; that she would rather not sleep, working day and night to knit wool sweaters for her fiancé!…

Of course, idle talk is not necessarily reliable. But because of those idle words, I seemed to have a little understanding of Xu Xiangying's mysterious and terrifying coldness. I understood: the more fervent a woman's love, the more intense her jealousy and suspicion. There was no way around it.

"No need to explain, let her be!" Unable to find a chance, I finally smiled faintly and stopped paying attention to her.

But I myself don't remember how many days passed. In short, it seemed to be winter, near Christmas, on a quiet night, Xu Xiangying, who had had appendicitis surgery and was sleeping in the bed opposite mine, gently called my name and said to me:

"Do you know why I specifically wanted to sleep in your room this time I had surgery? I wanted to find a chance to talk to you, because I'm leaving soon!"

"Are you going to the interior?" Remembering what she had told me the first night, I wasn't surprised.

"Yes, going to the interior. But I have chronic appendicitis, and I was afraid it would flare up on the road, so I had it removed in advance. At the same time, I can also take this opportunity to talk to you...." She didn't go on, but turned her head to look at me, her eyes gentle, but with suspicion and pain in the gentleness. I knew that this opportunity should not be missed. So I got up and walked gently to her bedside, very frankly and simply telling her about the relationship between Mei Qi and me.

I knew that she believed that I hadn't lied to her, because after listening, she nodded and reached out to hold my hand. But suddenly, I noticed two teardrops hanging from the corner of her eye. She was crying!

Perhaps tears are the most useless things in the world. But tears can also occasionally be like a sudden rain, washing away the barriers between people. She cried, but that mysterious and terrifying thing in her eyes also disappeared.

"I believe you. But I dare not believe Mei Qi. Some people say that he has someone else in the interior..." After wiping away her tears, she looked at me and said half a sentence. Her voice was sincere, and her eyes were also sincere.

That's how we understood each other. In the short two weeks, I got to know Xu Xiangying a lot. I felt that although she was a modern miss, her personality was very much like an ancient chaste woman. Her love was single-minded and unchanging. She showed me a few letters written to her by a young doctor in Beiping, the words very sincere and touching. But she gave me a sad smile and said, "I have already loved Mei Qi, and no man can move my heart!" I also felt that her love for Mei Qi was a kind of almost maternal love. She treated Mei Qi like a son, pitying him, taking care of him, knowing that he was somewhat glib and unreliable, but not blaming him, saying, "There must be some bad woman tempting him, so I have to go and see him no matter what!" Hearing these words, I felt moved and embarrassed.

As Christmas approached, the stitches on Xu Xiangying's stomach were removed, and she was able to get up and walk around. So she planned to set off for the interior as soon as the new year began. But at that time, Mei Qi sent a letter, roughly saying that he needed two shirts, and the cloth in the interior was very expensive, etc. So she became very busy.

It had snowed, and the weather was terribly cold, and the wound on her stomach had not completely healed. But for several nights in a row, I woke up from my dream and saw her still sitting on the bed, wearing a white silver fox coat, her head drooping, sewing shirts for her lover. So I remembered that painting in her commemorative album. In the dim green light, I seemed to see a white-clad angel, standing on the clouds, spreading her arms and looking down on the earth.

I remember it was January 20, 1940. She left. When she left, she asked me to write a few words in her commemorative album to leave as a memento. So I wrote these two sentences:

"My friend,
My most admired white-clad angel,
May you be happy!"

She left. On the arduous journey, she still didn't forget me and sent two letters. But after those two letters, she never sent any more letters. Because I didn't know her address, I had no way to send letters to her. Of course, I could still hear some scattered news about her. Some said that she had gotten married, some said that she had developed lung disease, and some said that she had become a nun. It seemed that all the news was unreliable, so I didn't dare to believe any of it.

However, reliable news finally came. Last winter, a friend who came out of the interior to see me said to me, "Do you know? Mei Qi's fiancée, Xu Xiangying, committed suicide!"

"Why did she commit suicide?" I was so frightened that I trembled all over.

"Of course, for Mei Qi!" The friend quietly answered me. "That little rascal didn't really love her in the first place. He recently graduated from college, doesn't need her money anymore, so he abandoned her!"

That day was the winter solstice festival. Hearing this news, I felt indescribable grief and sadness. Just then, my fellow patient Li Shan and her newly acquainted boyfriend Mr. Lu came, and I told them about this matter. Li Shan listened and smiled indifferently: "Xu Xiangying was too stupid! I say that such a woman is suffering the consequences of her own actions and should die! Do you think so?"

Is it right?… I knew maybe it was right! But I didn't answer Li Shan, just quietly stood up and walked to the window, facing the vast sky, silently shouting:

"My friend,
My most admired white-clad angel,
May you rest in peace forever!" (To be continued)

### Stillness

— Lan Ge

Stillness has an unspeakable, profound meaning.

The gentle flowing water in the stream; the ever-changing clouds in the sky; a gust of breeze in the pine forest; the bark of a dog in the fields; a bee among the flowers; the crow of a rooster in the morning; the cry of a crow in the evening; the sound of a chime in an ancient temple; and a row of tree shadows under the moonlight… These are all the conditions that make up stillness.

Because without noise, there is no stillness. So stillness is produced by the slight changes in the emptiness and tranquility. It gives people a transcendent image and heightened senses.

When night falls on the earth, stillness absorbs all the noise of the earth. At that time, the bark of a dog in the wilderness is stillness, the cry of an owl in the forest is stillness. Stillness makes the surrounding air light, but it also makes the air tense. In the lightness of stillness, we will give all the troubles of our hearts to the desolate and tranquil air; in the ups and downs of reality, we will think of some past dreams and vague hopes for the future. At that time, we are happy, we are relaxed. But in the tension of stillness, we seem to have plunged our hearts into the dark abyss, everything is difficult and terrifying, forgetting the past dreams, and not thinking about the bright hopes for the future, but facing the terrifying reality with shocking and disappointing tremors.

We will also secretly explore our past behaviors in the air of stillness, so that our calm hearts can receive a little comforting encouragement and repentance for sins. Because only stillness is the best mirror that allows us to clearly look back on the past; the so-called "reflecting on mistakes at midnight" is also said in conjunction with stillness.

Chekhov said: "We should wait until we have calmed down before we can write!" Stillness is indeed the best water filter to clarify our emotions and correct our rationality. For those who do not have a moment of quiet time to let them ponder carefully, their emotions are dangerous - their pens are also dangerous.

People who live in the hustle and bustle of reality, you can be quiet for a while. The whole era is turbulent and disturbing, but there is always a place and a moment in time that can allow you to think quietly and review honestly. We know that a quiet world cannot be built without a calm and rational heart!

Long Serial Novel

### Double Flight, Double Abode 83

— Zhao Qingge

Brigade Commander "Dry Father" was a regular customer at a restaurant, so he often brought Lihua to this restaurant. He also constantly sent banquets to Lihua's residence to entertain her. Brigade Commander "Dry Father" had a trimmed Japanese-style mustache and was tall and fat. Lihua, in his presence, was like a chick in front of a tiger. Therefore, when Lihua saw him, she was as afraid as a mouse seeing a cat, but she had no choice but to hold her nose and humor him.

One day, Brigade Commander "Dry Father" invited Lihua to dinner, saying that after dinner he would take her to the theater. Usually, Lihua was always accompanied by Mrs. Mo wherever she went. This time, Brigade Commander "Dry Father" did not allow Mrs. Mo to go with her. Mrs. Mo felt that she was with "Dry Father," so she was very relieved and did not accompany Lihua. As a result, Lihua became even more afraid. Upon arriving at the restaurant, Brigade Commander "Dry Father" had already prepared a beautiful private room, with no other guests, only Lihua herself. At this time, Lihua began to mutter to herself, but she couldn't leave immediately. Brigade Commander "Dry Father" ordered a lot of wine and dishes, and diligently looked after Lihua, but Lihua couldn't eat anything.

"Lihua, Dry Father really likes you. How about you follow Dry Father starting tomorrow?" Brigade Commander "Dry Father" said to Lihua with a smile while drinking wine.

"That's outrageous!" Lihua thought to herself. She understood that the word "follow" was not meant in a good way. But she didn't say anything, only smiled.

"Say it! Say whether you are willing to follow Dry Father?" the "gentleman" Dry Father pressed.

"No!" Lihua shook her head and said. "I want to be with Mom!" Lihua couldn't think of a suitable answer in that sudden moment.

### Sincerity

— Shao Fu

"Great deceit resembles trustworthiness, great treachery resembles loyalty, outward appearance shows simplicity, inner self hides cunning deception; arrogant and disrespectful to superiors, secretive and harmful to others."

Reading the above sentences from Lü Hui's memorial impeaching Wang Anshi in the History of the Song Dynasty, I had many thoughts. First, Wang Anshi was very influential at the time and deeply favored by Emperor Shenzong. A minor remonstrator actually had such courage. Second, deceit as trustworthiness, treachery as loyalty, simplicity as outward appearance, cunning deception—this set of logic is not entirely unfounded and does have some truth to it. Third, people's views, or political opinions, are often difficult to understand, and "wrongness" seems to have its own "theoretical basis."

Taking Wang Anshi as an example, he was indeed a political reformer and not an extreme villain. His reforms, such as the Young Crop Loan System, were not necessarily intended to benefit the country and the people. As for the merits, demerits, achievements, and crimes, posterity will have its own judgment, so I won't discuss them here.

The most important quality for a politician is sincerity. Only with sincerity can one gain trust. Today, people like to talk about tactics and strive for promotion, often trapping themselves.

The current social atmosphere can be described as "I deceive you, and you deceive me." Everyone is using deception, and this phenomenon is more dangerous than any other danger. If people are constantly scheming against each other and cannot trust each other, what kind of world will it become?

Not only that, society is also rewarding fraud. As a result, good people and honest people are gradually decreasing, while friends with "gimmicks" are becoming more and more numerous, which is truly heartbreaking!

The sultry heat is oppressive, and I have some thoughts after reading the History of the Song Dynasty. I'm just rambling on for a few lines, knowing that it's incoherent, but I don't care, and it's hard to care.

### Beware of Black Glasses!

— Dongfang Jing

Summer has arrived, and black glasses are popular again. Moreover, this year, they are even more "American-equipped," fashionable plus fashionable, truly "top-notch, top-notch." What's more, so-called modern people even wear black glasses in winter.

However, being fashionable is one thing, and health is another. Perhaps modern men and women are willing to sacrifice their health to pursue fashion. However, anyone with reason must be more cautious and think more. I hope everyone will read Professor George Keith's article in "Health Magazine": "Beware of Black Glasses!"

The United States sells about 20 million pairs of black glasses every year. Of course, everyone is buying black glasses to make their eyes more comfortable and to protect their eyesight. However, the number of people suffering from eye inflammation, eye swelling, and eye rot in the United States increases every summer. Many of these people have blind spots in their eyes. A famous ophthalmologist said, "Wearing black glasses to increase eye comfort is unreliable. As for protecting eyesight, in most cases, it doesn't do anything."

Solar radiation is composed of several different types of light, including visible light, as well as invisible ultraviolet and infrared light (heat light). Cheap black glasses, like smoked or tinted lenses, can reduce the glare of the sun, but they cannot completely absorb the invisible, harmful light from the sun.

Under normal circumstances, the pupils contract enough to allow sufficient light to reach the retina behind the eyeball, creating a clear image. However, black glasses weaken the visible light from the sun, causing the pupils to dilate and exposing the sensitive interior of the eye.

The eyes are naturally able to adapt to small amounts of ultraviolet and infrared light. Some ophthalmologists even believe that small amounts of ultraviolet and infrared light are beneficial to the eyes. However, too much ultraviolet light can cause conjunctivitis. Some longer ultraviolet rays enter the lens of the eyeball from the cornea, producing fluorescence and damaging normal vision.

Infrared light is even more harmful! If you stare directly at the sun and then lower your head, you will see a black spot, even when your eyes are closed. This is the afterimage of the sun, and infrared light causes minor damage to the cornea. If you look at the sun for too long—even while wearing black glasses—the persistent black spot may permanently damage your vision. Even with black glasses, the inner membrane of the eye has been burned into a black spot by infrared light.

Even ordinary colorless lenses can absorb small amounts of ultraviolet light, so any black glasses can partially resist ultraviolet radiation. However, doctors warn everyone that cheap black glasses generally do not adequately protect eyesight and are unreliable. These inferior black glasses are ordinary lenses that are tinted with several metal fumes.

Dr. Tang, a professor of ophthalmology at New York University, said, "From a scientific standpoint, the best black glasses can absorb ultraviolet and infrared light and evenly absorb a portion of the seven types of light in the sun."

Good black glasses are made from ground lenses. They can absorb ultraviolet and infrared light, reducing visible light to a comfortable level.

Regarding the color of sunglasses, some advocate green, while others advocate green-yellow, because they do not cause color illusions. This is even more important when driving. Some colors, such as dark amber, often make it difficult for people wearing black glasses to distinguish red and green lights, which can cause accidents.

Dr. Tang summarized the opinions of American ophthalmologists on black glasses. They all advocate that black glasses must be ground and should only be worn in strong sunlight. Fifty percent of the experts believe that wearing black glasses when not in strong sunlight is harmful.

### I Love Doctors

— Yang Yongzhang

——After reading "I'm Afraid of Hospitals"

After reading the article "I'm Afraid of Doctors" in "Free Talk" on the 9th, many thoughts welled up in my heart, and I really wanted to talk "freely" about it.

"The duty of medicine is to serve humanity. Other professions also serve society. Farmers provide food, merchants sell supplies, and lawyers protect human rights. They are all doing their best for humanity. However, the doctor's profession not only satisfies one or a few needs of society, but he is concerned with the entire happiness of human life. Every kind of disease endangers life. A small sore can lead to death, and every disease is dangerous. The doctor is the rescuer. Therefore, the importance of his duty can only be compared with another helper of mankind—the pastor. Doctors and pastors come from the same source." This is what Dr. Sigerist of the United States said. My thoughts are completely in line with his.

The symbol of medicine is a bright red cross. The white background and red cross can be seen everywhere in hospitals. Due to the connection of thoughts, people recall the cross in Christianity. Under the banner of freedom of belief, doctors, even if they do not believe in Christ, should at least have the great spirit of Christ to heal patients; because medicine is also a cross—love, sacrifice, compassion. The doctor's goal should not be money, otherwise he cannot be considered a good doctor. He is just a "merchant" who knows medicine. The merchant's mind is focused on money, but the doctor's object is definitely not these, only "life" is the doctor's requirement.

Merchants sell retail goods to others or hoard them without selling. Although it can cause people to suffer losses, the losses are limited. Perhaps there are ways to remedy them. However, in medicine, even the slightest mistake can kill the patient, and there is absolutely no way to remedy it. There may be room for appeals against court decisions, but the disasters caused by the doctor's negligence cannot be restrained. Medicine directly affects personal health and life, and indirectly concerns the happiness of society, the country, and all of humanity. From this, we can see the doctor's responsibility and mission. If all the doctors today were to withdraw from the crowd and let diseases ravage and destroy humanity, what kind of fate would the people of this world face?

Why do some people say, "People are afraid of doctors"? Should doctors be feared? No, absolutely not; here I must explain the definition of "doctor." In China, there are many people who call themselves "doctors," and others also call them "doctors," but they have not received adequate medical education and training. At the same time, they become "doctors" for the same reason they pursue other professions, to make a living. The reason why the doctor's position in Chinese society has not reached the theoretical level is because the doctors themselves lack knowledge and morality (medical ethics). Therefore, doctors not only fail to save people but also kill them. This kind of doctor (note that he is not an ideal doctor) is of course to be "feared." Therefore, doctors must enrich their knowledge and pay attention to medical ethics!

Diseases destroy human beings, taking away their innate happiness and joy. Diseases disrupt the normal rhythm of life. Due to the lack of sanitation facilities and doctors, and the naivety of public knowledge, how many people die unjustly every year? Many remote areas cannot find "traditional Chinese medicine practitioners," and there are very few "doctors" in towns and villages. Even in big cities, due to the poor social system and economic constraints, some poor people do not have money to see a doctor once they get sick, and they let the disease make the final decision.

In short, improving medicine is an urgent task for China today. To have a strong country, we must first have a strong people. Dare I ask, is a person with profound knowledge and a noble character but without a healthy body beneficial to the country and the nation? In this way, the importance of medicine is self-evident.

We hope that the social system can be improved so that people do not lose the opportunity to receive treatment due to insufficient economic conditions. At the same time, we also hope that those who become doctors will truly serve patients!

Finally, I say, "I love doctors!"

### "Don't Cheat Three Kinds of Foreigners"

— Wen Yi

The day before yesterday, in the evening, I took tram number one in the old British Concession because I had some official business. Because there were few passengers at the time, the ticket seller had time to chat with a few of them, gradually talking about the ticket seller's skimming of fares. The ticket seller seemed very pleased about this matter. Finally, one of the passengers asked him what kind of passengers he wouldn't skim fares from.

"Haha! We adhere to the 'Don't Cheat Three Kinds of Foreigners' principle!" the ticket seller said with a laugh.

Indeed! This term was too novel. At the time, because I was curious, I asked him to explain what he meant, that is, I asked him what the "Don't Cheat Three Kinds of Foreigners" principle was!

"First, don't cheat those who wear Western clothes, because although people who wear suits don't say a word in front of us, they often cause trouble when the ticket inspector comes, at worst scolding us and deducting our salary, at worst breaking our rice bowl. To be cautious, we believe that those who wear Western clothes cannot be cheated. Second, don't cheat foreigners, because if we cheat foreigners, being scolded to our face is considered lenient punishment. The harmful ones will copy down the number and report it to the company, and breaking our rice bowl is inevitable. Therefore, we don't cheat foreigners out of a single cent. Third, don't cheat 'yangpans' (a colloquial term for country bumpkins), because one day one of our colleagues cheated a 'yangpan' out of money and told the 'yangpan,' 'When the ticket inspector comes, say you got on at the racetrack.' It just so happened that when they arrived at the racetrack, a ticket inspector came up and asked him for his ticket, asking him, 'Where did you get on?' 'The racetrack.' 'How long have you been on?' 'A long time.' At the time, the ticket inspector realized that the words didn't match, and the cheating was real, so he gave the ticket seller a major demerit. Therefore, don't cheat 'yangpans,' lest you overreach yourself!"

The ticket seller's long talk made me chuckle, because this was a laughable and ridiculous matter.

### To My Deceased Wife Feng Jun (5)

— Zhou Shoujuan

I was busy for more than an hour. Thank goodness, with the help of Dr. Wu's heart stimulant and saline injection, I finally saved you. I had seen you open an eye, and I had heard you open your mouth once, but your tongue was stiff and I couldn't hear what you were saying. Afterward, you fell asleep as if you were going to sleep. Dr. Wu saw that there was nothing more for him to do, said goodbye and left, promising to come again tomorrow morning at seven or eight o'clock. Little Qing comforted me for a while and then also went back. I was still not very relieved. I sat in the armchair beside the bed, accompanying you. I sent my nephew, Xiao Xi, back to sleep, but Bao Mei and Mother Ye were startled and scared away their drowsiness, so they stayed up with me.

When the sky was bright and the birds were chattering in the garden, you were still sleeping soundly, snoring softly and not waking up. Our six eyes were fixed on your pale face, anxious as anything. After eight o'clock, Dr. Wu still hadn't arrived, so I hurriedly called Shi Jing to urge him. It wasn't until after nine o'clock that Dr. Wu hurried over. He put the thermometer under your armpit and said that your body temperature was normal. He listened to your heart again and said that your heart was also keeping normal. He took your pulse again and said that your pulse was also beating slower than last night. Then why were you still unconscious? Had the lung disease reached your brain? I voiced this terrible speculation, and Dr. Wu said that it was possible, but once it reached this point, there was no saving you. After he left, leaving a pre-written prescription, we were thrown back into the depths of despair. I forced my tired eyes to look at you, hoping that you would suddenly wake up, but one or two hours quickly passed and you were still snoring softly, seeming to be sleeping soundly. In desperation, I wrote a letter to Senior Zou Jingpu, describing what happened last night and asking him to make a long-distance phone call to Shanghai to summon Zheng'er and Ling'er, brother and sister, back. I immediately called Shi Jing to send it to Zou's residence in Ma Yike, and I also gave him the prescription to get medicine from the Guanqian Pharmacy and bring it back. For the sake of emphasis, I also called Xiao Xi to the telegraph office to send an urgent telegram to Zheng'er, saying, "Mother is in danger, immediately return to Suzhou with Ling!"

The weather, like human affairs, was unpredictable. Suddenly, a strong wind began to blow. At noon, I forced myself to eat half a bowl of rice as if I were swallowing lead bullets. Bao Mei and Mother Ye hadn't slept all night, so they went to rest. I was alone in the room with you, standing by the window listening to the wind. It was blowing the tall plane trees and the dense bamboo forest, as if ten thousand horses were galloping. I was terrified. I looked up at the sky and silently prayed for you, hoping that the wind would blow my prayers up to heaven for God to hear, hoping that the wind would blow in through the window and onto your bed to wake you up.

The wind was blowing like crazy, blowing, blowing. My heart was extremely agitated, and I ran into the garden as if I were going crazy. I saw the sun shining brightly and no one around, except for the roaring wind and no other sounds. I inexplicably circled around and returned to your bedside, only to see that you were still lying there motionless and had not woken up. No matter how many times I called your name, you always ignored me. The tall grandfather clock in the corner struck three times. It was hard on the kind-hearted Mr. Zou Jing, who, at the age of seventy-four, braved the strong wind to come. The old gentleman tightly held my hand, comforted me a few words, walked to the bed to look at you, and then said to me sadly, "Your wife seems to be in her last moments. You must restrain your grief and prepare her." I could only cry and choke, and I couldn't say a word. He and Bao Mei discussed funeral clothes and coffins, and in a moment, they had decided everything in an orderly manner and volunteered to prepare them for me. You can imagine how uncomfortable I was at this time. It was as if I had been sentenced to death. I just sat on the edge of the bed, staring blankly at you, listening to your snoring and the heavy sound of the pendulum clock echoing each other.
