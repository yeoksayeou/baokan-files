At noon, the entire group went to Wuyi Road for a luncheon hosted by Sun Ke. Attendees included all government representatives, representatives of the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and prominent figures from society in Nanjing, as well as Zhou Enlai, Deng Yingchao, and Li Weihan from the Communist Party. After the meal, informal comprehensive talks were held, and Stuart and Chuan Jingbo were also invited to attend. The ambassador, during the meeting, expressed words of encouragement, stating briefly: "Today marks the first gathering of all parties. We should think in terms of construction and avoid acting impulsively." After the meeting, Sun Ke issued a statement: the Three-Person Group, the Informal Five-Person Group, the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) Comprehensive Group, and the PCC Constitutional Draft Review Committee can all resume meetings. Various parties not in power have expressed their agreement, but they hope the government will reconsider the date of the National Assembly. At 5 p.m., the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and others gathered again at the Bank of Communications to discuss ways to facilitate the smooth progress of various meetings. In addition, during the meeting at Sun's residence, Zhou Enlai expressed his views on the National Assembly, believing that it must be discussed by all parties.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 9th] Government representatives Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, Lei Zhen, and others visited the Chairman at 5 p.m. on the 9th to report on the informal comprehensive talks held that afternoon, leaving around 7 p.m. Subsequently, Wang Shijie met at his residence with Li Huang, Zuo Shunsheng of the Youth Party, and Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, and others who arrived in Nanjing on the 9th. It was decided that the second informal comprehensive talks would be held at Sun Ke's residence at 3 p.m. on the 10th. It is reported that the focus of the discussion on the 9th was the date of the National Assembly and the draft constitution. Some people believe that the National Assembly will proceed with the opening ceremony as scheduled, but the date for the start of deliberations may be slightly delayed, and negotiations will be conducted during this interim period. A decision on this matter may be made at the meeting on the afternoon of the 10th.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 9th] Luo Longji, Zuo Shunsheng, and Miao Jiaming visited Zhou Enlai on the evening of the 9th, and then Zhang Shenfu and others visited Sun Ke at 8:30 p.m., returning to Lan Jiazhuang at 10:30 p.m.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 9th] Wang Bingnan, of the Communist Party delegation, went to the U.S. Embassy at 11 a.m. on the 9th to explain his views on the Chairman's statement of the 8th, leaving after talking for half an hour. Also, Special Envoy Marshall instructed Colonel Ke E this morning to deliver a letter to the Communist Party delegation, the contents of which are unknown. Regarding the government's ceasefire order issued on the 8th, when reporters inquired with the Communist Party spokesperson this evening, they said: "We did not receive any prior notice, nor do we know anything about it afterward. The Communist Party's operations are entirely self-defense, so there is no need to issue a ceasefire order to stop." However, regarding the ceasefire, Zhou Enlai will visit Special Envoy Marshall for talks in the coming days. The content of the Communist Party's reply to Chairman Chiang's eight points is very simple, stating only that some issues were discussed with Wu and Shao in Shanghai, and that the Communist Party's view that Chairman Chiang's eight points should be based on negotiations was conveyed by Zhou himself.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 9th] After receiving Wang Bingnan this morning, Stuart visited Special Envoy Marshall with Chuan Jingbo at noon and had lunch together. It is reported that he conveyed the Communist Party's views on Chairman Chiang's statement of the 8th.

### Ceasefire Orders Received Everywhere; Subordinates Instructed to Comply

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 9th] A spokesperson for the Xing Yuan (Commander in Chief's Office) told reporters on the 9th that the ceasefire order issued by Chairman Chiang yesterday has been received by the Xing Yuan and that troops in all areas have been strictly ordered to execute it. When asked by reporters how to handle situations where National Army forces were attacked, the spokesperson consulted with Chief of Staff Wang Hongzhao and replied: "The ceasefire order must be executed, but the National Army will not be beaten without resistance."

[Our Chongqing Correspondent, 9th] The ceasefire order issued by the Chairman on the 8th prompted several newspapers here to issue special editions after 10 p.m., easing the heavy and uneasy hearts of the mountain city in the cold wind and drizzling rain. The Chongqing Xing Yuan received the ceasefire order at noon on the 9th and immediately notified all subordinates to implement it conscientiously.

[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent, 9th] It is reported that after receiving Chairman Chiang's ceasefire order, the Jiangsu Provincial Military and Political Office urgently telegraphed all front-line commanders in northern Jiangsu and local administrative authorities to comply, and it is also reported that the National Army advancing towards Yancheng will stop at Liuzhuang, awaiting further orders. It is generally predicted that if the communist forces in Yancheng and Funing do not take the opportunity to attack the National Army, the war situation in northern Jiangsu is expected to ease.

[Our Tianjin Correspondent, 9th] Chairman of Shandong Province, Wang Yaowu, received the ceasefire order and has telegraphed all National Army and security forces in the province to comply.

### Liang Shuming on Ceasefire: Situation May Improve or Stagnate

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 9th] Liang Shuming, Secretary-General of the Democratic League, told reporters at his private residence in Beiping on the 9th: "After the government issued the ceasefire order, the situation may improve, but it may also become more rigid and difficult to resolve. Because the government's proclamation has made everything fixed and not easily flexible. A ceasefire is naturally a good thing, but in the government's proclamation, many political issues, such as the reservation of seats for various parties in the National Assembly and the constitutional issue, are inconsistent with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and problems are sure to arise." When asked by reporters whether the Communist Army would also cease fire since the government had clearly ordered a ceasefire, Liang replied: "That depends on how the Communist Party decides its own policies." Liang also said: "Zhou Enlai previously advocated convening a meeting of the Military Three-Person Group. Now that the government has announced the convening of the Military Three-Person Group under these conditions, whether the Communist Party will participate will become a difficult problem for Zhou Enlai to ponder."

### Zhang Junmai's Remarks

Hoping to Eliminate the Basic Causes of Conflict

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 9th] Zhang Junmai issued a statement regarding the ceasefire order issued by the Chairman, saying that today's ceasefire order is indeed a satisfactory request for all parties, but although the ceasefire order has been issued, it is still necessary to further seek the elimination of the basic causes of the conflict and how to eliminate them. For this purpose, in the political aspect, there are the five resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference supported by all parties, and in the military aspect, there are the two points of the signed reorganization plan. It is still hoped that both points and all parties will unreservedly seek their implementation, laying a foundation for peace and comforting the hopes of the people of the whole country.

### Ye Jianying's Remarks

Communist Army Not Bound by Ceasefire Order

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 9th] After Chairman Chiang issued the ceasefire order, reporters visited Ye Jianying, the Communist Party representative of the Military Mediation Department, on the morning of the 9th, and first asked whether the Communist Party's actions would also be bound by this ceasefire order since the government had issued a ceasefire order. Ye replied that they were not bound by it. He also said: "Since the government has interpreted past military actions as self-defense, it will continue to defend itself if necessary in the future. In this case, this road is not a road to peace, but a road to war." When asked by reporters whether the Nanjing peace talks would continue under the current circumstances, Ye replied: "It depends on whether there is any development in the outside discussions in Nanjing. As of this morning, Ye had not received instructions from Zhou Enlai in Nanjing and Yan'an. The Military Mediation Department has also not received new tasks. On the morning of the 9th, Ye was studying Chairman Chiang's ceasefire proclamation with his senior staff.

### White Snow Beyond the Great Wall

— A Reporter's Inspection of Jin, Sui, and Chahar

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 9th] A group of twenty-two Chinese and foreign reporters, after inspecting Zhangyuan and Datong, was originally scheduled to return to Beijing on the 4th. However, due to a malfunction of the special plane and changes in the climate on the frontier, the itinerary was changed, and the opportunity was taken to inspect Jining and Guihua while waiting for the plane. At 9 a.m. on the 9th, they took a plane from the Beiping Air Force District to Guihua and then returned to Datong. They changed to the special plane that had been repaired and returned to Beijing at 3 p.m. in the afternoon.

The reporter group departed from Beijing by special plane at 9:40 a.m. on October 31st. At 4:10 p.m., they flew to Zhangyuan, which had been recovered just twenty days earlier. Local order was restored five days after the recovery. The Temporary Political Affairs Committee of the Twelfth War Zone is now temporarily responsible for the administration of Chahar Province and Zhangyuan. It is handling various issues left by the Communist Party and resolving them smoothly in accordance with the central government's decisions.

The recovery of Zhangyuan has drastically changed the situation in North China. General Fu Zuoyi announced the course of the battle to the reporter group, saying: "This is a victory of the people's will and the soldiers' hatred." Jining was the site of the decisive battle. General Dong Qiwu led four divisions of troops to defeat the siege of more than 100,000 Communist troops and recovered Jining on September 14, thus relieving the siege of Datong. On November 5, they began advancing from Jining to Zhangyuan. The National Army learned that the Communist Army had deployed heavy troops along the railway line and detoured fifty li, directly attacking Zhangyuan from the northern line. The march was rapid and caught the Communist Army by surprise. At 11:50 a.m. on November 11, Zhangtan was taken without a fight, and the Communist Army set fire to the city and fled. At that time, General Sun Yunzhong's northward troops engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist Army in Huailai, achieving the effect of mutual support. After this setback, the remaining troops of the Chahar, Jin, and Sui Communist armies retreated into the Taihang Mountains. The reporters inspected the post-disaster situation in Zhangyuan, which was heartbreaking and filled with mixed feelings. The Japanese army had occupied the area for eight years and devoted itself to construction, creating an industrialized city. All the buildings have now been burned down by the Communist Army, and the huge and sophisticated machinery has been reduced to wreckage. The losses are incalculable. This kind of Communist violence has generated hatred from the depths of every person's heart. The reporters sought out the people's plight and gained a deep understanding of the Communist Party's slogans of "democracy" and "freedom." When local people answered the reporter's questions in their local dialect, they said: "Democracy" - "Alas, it's worse than autocracy!" "Freedom" - "Alas, it locks us in cages!" They do not call it the "Communist Party," but call it the "Bankruptcy Party."

The reporter group stayed in Zhangyuan for two days. At 4 p.m. on November 2, they flew to Datong, which had been besieged for forty-five days. Commander-in-Chief Chu Xichun and the heads of Datong party and government departments and students and civilians, a total of more than 2,000 people, lined up at the airport to welcome them, and their emotions were truly enthusiastic. Datong was besieged from August 3. Communist generals Yao Zhe, Xiao Ke, He Long, and Nie Rongzhen adopted a rotation tactic to besiege the defending troops, but they were unable to take it for a long time. Finally, they released tear gas bombs and occupied the suburban strongholds, but they were ultimately unable to break into the city. After Jining was recovered, the Communist Army's retreat route was cut off, and the military's morale was shaken. The Datong defending troops took advantage of the situation to launch a counterattack and lifted the siege on September 16. During the siege, the military and civilians cooperated with one heart, regarded death as home, were strong and unyielding, and there were many moving stories. When the Communist Army retreated, they thoroughly destroyed the Pingwang Power Plant, which was the largest in North China. The Datong Eight Coal Mines, which could produce 8,000 tons of coal per day and supply the needs of North China, now only produce 700 tons of coal per day after the destruction. The reporters went to pay their respects one by one, and sighed endlessly! On the way back to Datong, more than 300 miners and their families suddenly knelt down to the reporters and painfully recounted the disaster situation, the Communist Army's liquidation, and all kinds of atrocities in the struggle, and their voices were filled with tears as they faced the cliff of life.

The reporter group did not leave on the 4th. On the 5th, they took a special train on the Ping-Sui Railway to Jining for inspection, and waited for a plane to be sent from Beiping to pick them up. Jining is already on the frontier, higher in elevation than Zhangyuan, Datong, and Guihua. The cold wind was biting, and white snow was fluttering. It was already the weather of severe winter. The people who had experienced the disaster, in groups of three or five, told the reporters about their suffering. The losses they suffered during the year that the Communist Party occupied were greater than the losses they suffered during the eight years of Japanese occupation. Post-disaster relief is truly urgent.

The reporter group waited for a plane in Jining for two days, but the weather did not improve. On the evening of the 7th, they took a special train on the Ping-Sui Railway to Guihua again to wait for a plane. The climate there was better than in Jining. The train derailed in the middle of the journey, which can be said to be full of hardships. On the 9th, they finally boarded a plane in Guihua, transferred to Datong, and returned to Beijing. In total, the trip lasted ten days, one and a half times longer than the original schedule. The materials collected were very rich. As a result of the inspection, the true face of Communist Party cruelty was exposed to the world by Chinese and foreign reporter groups!

### Lu Dong Communist Army Largely Prepares for War; Attempts to Invade Jiaoxian and Jimo Unsuccessful; Yantai Communist Army Strengthens Coastal Defenses

[Our Newspaper, Jinan Dispatch, 8th] Yantai is a key Communist stronghold for sea access and a vital transportation hub between Liaoning and Shandong, making it a military necessity. Although previous reports of fighting were unconfirmed, based on the large-scale troop increases by the Communist army in Jiaodong and the National Army's counterattacks, a major battle is imminent. The Communist army in Linzi and Anqiu retreated on the 7th, but the Communist army in Yexian launched fierce reinforcements and counterattacks, with intense fighting continuing in the suburbs until the 8th, and the Communist army has not yet been repelled. The Shandong National Army has recovered 35 county-level cities, accounting for more than one-third of the province. Fourteen other county governments have entered their respective county territories to conduct business.

### No Changes in the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway; Large-Scale Troop Increases by the Communist Army in the Southern Section of the Tongpu Railway

As of 5:30 PM on the 9th, they were still in Jixian.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping Dispatch, 9th] The situation in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway remains largely unchanged today. The National Army is becoming more active in Yixian, and the county may be recovered before the ceasefire order takes effect. The Communist army in that area has spared no significant sacrifices in recent days, holding firmly to the dangerous mountains. After the National Army recovers Yixian, the Communist army's threat to transportation on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway will be limited. Highway transportation on the Pingbao section is smooth, and 40 vehicles arrived in Baoding from Beiping today.

Currently, there are over 3,000 Communist troops in Dawangzhuang and Xiaowangzhuang in Huo County, attempting to attack Lingshi, and approximately 10,000 Communist troops preparing for war within Zhao County. To the southeast of Hongdong, there are three Communist regiments blockading transportation lines.

### Shenyang Plans to Be Reclassified as a Special Municipality; City Council Petition Delegation Flies to Nanjing to Meet with President Song

[Central News Agency, Shenyang Dispatch, 9th] A petition delegation from the Shenyang City Council, including Zhang Shici, is scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 9th to meet with President Song, requesting that Shenyang be reclassified as a special municipality. Shenyang has a population of 1.6 million, an area of 62 square miles, and held a long-term leading position in culture, politics, and economics before September 18th. During the period under enemy and puppet control, it was designated as a heavy industrial zone, with a population of nearly 3 million, known as the second largest city in the East. Since the central government took over, Shenyang's position has become increasingly important. All central military and political organs are located here, making it the political, economic, and cultural center of the Northeast. Therefore, it fully possesses the conditions to be a municipality under the direct administration of the Executive Yuan, surpassing Harbin and Dalian. In comparison to Nanjing and Shanghai, it is also comparable. However, due to its current status as an ordinary municipality, it faces difficulties in funding sources, and industrial and commercial development cannot progress. If this continues, there will be no hope for recovery, and even maintaining the status quo will be difficult. The citizens of Shenyang all hope that the government will elevate Shenyang's status and establish a foundation for the revitalization of the Northeast.

### Overseas Chinese Economic Symposium Passes Five Guiding Principles; Chen Lifu Points Out the Main Problems in the Serious Economic Situation

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Overseas Chinese Economic Symposium, convened by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, was held at the Public Recreation Society from 9:00 AM on the 9th. After lunch, the five issues proposed by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission were discussed: (1) establishing an Overseas Chinese Economic Enterprise Bureau to manage overseas Chinese economic enterprises; (2) encouraging overseas Chinese shipping merchants to develop international transportation; (3) establishing a Chinese Goods Exhibition Hall to promote domestic products; (4) strengthening financial organizations to make overseas Chinese capital more flexible; and (5) designating areas for overseas Chinese investment in Taiwan, Hainan Island, and other places. All were approved in principle. Furthermore, the proposal by Pan Xulun to establish an Overseas Chinese Economic Problem Research Institute to regularly liaise with relevant government agencies, provide concrete suggestions, solve various difficulties faced by overseas Chinese, seek welfare for overseas Chinese compatriots, and jointly participate in national construction was also approved in principle.

Wang Yunwu's Address

Those present today included Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Chen Shuren, Deputy Chairman Zhou Qigang, representatives from relevant ministries, and overseas Chinese representatives from various regions, including Liu Ruxin (England), Lu Chaoran (United States), Feng Erhe (Siam), Liang Jinshan (Burma), Chen Zhaoji (Vietnam), and over 70 others. After Chairman Zhou Qigang respectfully read the will of the Founding Father, Minister Wang Yunwu delivered the first address, stating that the Kuomintang Sixth Plenary Session had resolved to convene an Overseas Chinese Economic Conference, but due to the impact of the war and transportation, it was not until today, taking advantage of the presence of representatives in Nanjing to attend the National Federation of Commerce and the National Assembly, that this meeting was convened. He hoped to use this opportunity to understand the situation of overseas Chinese returning home, find ways to assist them, and discuss how to encourage overseas Chinese to invest and participate in domestic economic construction. The main issues for the symposium are fivefold: (1) The issue of overseas Chinese economic recovery. After the victory, the government allocated 50 million US dollars to be managed by the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank to provide recovery loans and fairly subsidize returning overseas Chinese in various regions. The government has always paid close attention to the interests of overseas Chinese. After the war, the situation in the Dutch East Indies was dire, and overseas Chinese suffered significant losses. The government has dispatched Special Envoy Li Dijun to offer condolences and provide relief. (2) The issue of overseas Chinese investing in the country. After the victory, national construction work is urgently needed. The resources of the Northeast, Taiwan, the Northwest, and the Southwest, in particular, need to be developed. This is a good opportunity for overseas Chinese to establish businesses in the country. The government has published incentive measures and hopes to receive suggestions based on the current situation. (3) Overseas sales markets: Overseas markets, especially those in Southeast Asia that were previously dominated by Japanese goods, should be replaced by Chinese goods. He hopes that everyone will carefully plan and strive to achieve this. (4) The issue of organizing overseas Chinese industrial and commercial groups: All endeavors rely on cooperation between the government and the people. He hopes that overseas Chinese industrial and commercial groups will unite and cooperate with domestic industrial and commercial groups to work together for national construction. (5) Other issues regarding overseas Chinese economy. He hopes that all representatives will speak freely.

Chen Shuren's Address

Chairman Chen Shuren of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission then gave a speech, saying that the relationship between overseas Chinese and the motherland has always been extremely close, and that they have made great contributions to the motherland's revolution and war of resistance. In the future, national construction work will rely heavily on them. He hoped that they would better understand the national situation, invest in domestic economic construction, improve production and sales systems, and expand overseas markets, and asked them to fully express their opinions on this. Representatives from various ministries and overseas Chinese leaders then spoke, with the main content summarized as follows: (1) Protection of overseas Chinese: The inability to fully protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese in various places is the most serious economic problem. This is a prerequisite for enabling overseas Chinese to invest in the country. The government should pay special attention to this. (2) Overseas remittances: Many overseas governments restrict overseas remittances, and the restoration of overseas branches of domestic banks is slow, making it extremely inconvenient for overseas Chinese to remit money. He hopes that the government will find ways to improve this situation and facilitate the return of capital to the country. (3) Shipping: The domestic and foreign shipping industries are underdeveloped, resulting in outflow of freight costs and hindering cargo transport. He proposed a unified plan for investment in the development of inland and ocean shipping. (4) Recovery loans for overseas Chinese should be implemented quickly and be fair. (5) Improve the quality of domestic goods and promote them widely to capture overseas markets.

Chen Lifu's Remarks

At 1:00 PM, everyone had lunch together. During the meal, Chen Lifu arrived and gave an impromptu talk on "China's Current Economic Problems," stating that the domestic economic situation is serious, with two main problems: (1) Contraction of currency extends to production capital. Regarding the issuance of legal tender, due to fear of inflation, frantic contraction is taking place. This measure is not incorrect, but attention must be paid to not contracting the currency in the production sector. Otherwise, production will be limited, materials will decrease, prices will naturally rise, and it will not solve the problem. (2) Bank policies are not in line with the national situation. The current strange phenomenon in the financial world is that assets cannot be converted into liquid capital. Only raw materials can be mortgaged for loans. This is because the bank policies in our country acknowledge the policies of colonial banks under the great powers. Under this type of banking system, depositors seek high interest rates, private banks use speculative industries, and investors are afraid, leading to production stagnation. Therefore, the current serious economic situation is not the fault of any producer, nor can it be entirely attributed to the Communist Party's occupation. To find a solution, we must fundamentally reform the banking system and policies, and strictly distinguish between production capital and surplus currency. He has expressed these views to President Song and believes that if financial authorities can vigorously cure the economic root causes and eradicate the legacy of colonialists, they can solve the most serious problems.

After lunch, the meeting continued to discuss the five issues proposed by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the proposal by Pan Xulun, all of which were approved in principle. Finally, Zhou Qigang made a summary, expressing his deep gratitude for the valuable opinions contributed by the overseas Chinese leaders. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Economic Affairs will adopt them as much as possible and consult with relevant agencies to quickly alleviate the suffering of overseas Chinese. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM.

### Opening of the Representatives Conference of the Industrial Association; Wu Yun-chu Reports on the Future Work Plan of the General Association

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Second Representatives Conference of the National Industrial Association of China opened at 9:00 AM on the 9th. Guests including Gu Zhenggang, Wang Yunwu (represented by Pan Xulun), Chen Lifu (represented by Peng Erkang), Wang Xiaolai, and representatives from various regions of the association, totaling approximately 90 people, attended. The venue was decorated simply, with three rows of long tables arranged lengthwise, covered with white tablecloths. The representatives sat in pairs in six rows. Chairman Wu Yun-chu presided over the meeting, leading the rituals, and then gave a speech, stating that China is a world power and that the state of China's industry is sufficient to affect the world economy and is closely related to world peace and human welfare. However, more than a year after the victory, the deterioration of the domestic situation has been unexpected. Transportation is blocked, raw materials are lacking, prices are rising, and people's livelihoods are withering. Not only can new construction not be discussed, but even the pre-war industries with a rudimentary scale cannot continue production. The domestic market is flooded with foreign goods, and the seriousness of the situation has reached its extreme. The convening of the Representatives Conference of the Industrial Association at this time is of great significance. He hopes that all colleagues will focus on two key points: (1) remedying the current industrial crisis and (2) studying the government's industrial laws and regulations, gather ideas, speak freely, and put forward concrete suggestions to the government. Then, he invited Gu Zhenggang to give instructions. He expressed his satisfaction with the enthusiastic participation of representatives from various regions in the meeting to discuss the future of the national industry. He also said that China must be industrialized before construction can be discussed, and the success of national economic construction is essential for establishing the country in the world today. The obstacles given to industry and commerce by the current domestic situation are temporary. Although all aspects of the country are suffering from the adverse effects of this situation, solutions will certainly be found in the resolution of the overall problem. Pan Xulun then gave a speech saying that government leaders and industrial leaders alike are anxious about China's economic problems and are painstakingly devising various possible solutions. He hoped that the conference could make concrete and feasible suggestions to the government and work hard to do what others cannot, helping the government to save the current crisis and improve the current state of industry. Peng Erkang then delivered a speech on behalf of Chen Lifu, offering encouragement to the representatives and wishing the conference great success. Finally, Wang Xiaolai gave a speech saying that industry and commerce are like the two eyes and two ears of the human body in the national economic enterprise. He hoped that people in the industry and commerce sectors would work closely together and strive for national construction. At 12:00 noon, the entire audience took a photo in front of the venue and then dispersed. The first general meeting was held at 3:00 PM, presided over by Wu Yun-chu, who reported on the future work plan of the general association. Representatives from various regions reported on the current industrial situation and branch affairs in their respective regions. Most industries in various regions are suffering and finding recovery difficult. The association's work has also lacked significant progress in the past year. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM. A group review meeting will be held on the morning of the 10th, and the second general meeting will be held in the afternoon to discuss the proposals.

### The Case of the Traitor Zhou Zuoren Concluded; What He Claimed in Court Yesterday Was Nothing But Excuses; The Court Ordered Sentencing on the 16th After Debate

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Zhou Zuoren, a traitor from "Kucha Zhai," was tried at the High Court on the 9th. At 10:30 AM, Zhou was escorted from the Tiger Bridge Detention Center to the High Court. At 10:45 AM, Presiding Judge Ge Zhitan, accompanied by Judges Ge Zhaotang and Yang Yutian, and Prosecutor Wang Wenzun, convened a collegiate panel in the Dacheng Hall. Five minutes later, Zhou stepped onto the defendant's stand, wearing a dark blue wool coat, a light blue homespun Chinese-style trousers, gray socks, black round-toed casual shoes, and glasses. His beard and hair were mottled, but his spirit was particularly good. The court first announced that the opening of the trial had been more than 15 days since the previous decision, so a new trial should be held, but because most of the evidence had already been investigated, the interrogation would be relatively simple. He then announced the results of the investigation of the documents not completed last time. Ying Qianli replied in a letter that he did not know that the defendant had tried to rescue him and had never communicated with him. Dong Xifan's notes were used as evidence, and the Shanghai District Court replied this year, but the previous letters with the defendant could be used as evidence. The court then questioned him on his allegiance to the enemy and his employment in puppet positions, as well as his发表谬论. Zhou replied that he stayed in Beiping after the July 7th Incident because his family had many people and could not leave. He said that his role in the puppet positions was to preserve the property of Peking University and was not due to being coerced after being assassinated. He said that when he was the chairman of the "East Asia Cultural Association," he had to say what he said because of his position, but he never said a word to slander the War of Resistance. During his tenure as a supervisor in the puppet Ministry of Education, he did not promote slave education. The preface to the book "The Dream of the Green Girl" written by Japanese women Meiniang and Kaneko was a general preface written for the series of creations by the Youth Library of the puppet Xinmin Bookstore, etc. All of his answers were excuses. At 11:10 AM, the debate began. After Prosecutor Wang Wenzun listed Zhou's crimes, Zhou refuted them one by one. At around 12:00 noon, his appointed lawyer, Wang Long, defended him on four points: (1) Staying in Beiping and taking up puppet positions after the July 7th Incident was entirely to complete the task of preserving the property of Peking University. Jiang Menglin and Hu Shi both had letters to prove this. (2) He had sheltered and rescued underground workers; (3) He was not the mastermind behind his allegiance to the enemy and was forced to do so; (4) He did not promote slave education. Chief Zhu had admitted this fact in a speech in Beiping. At 1:00 PM, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled sentencing for the morning of the 16th. Zhou was returned to detention.

Editorial

### After the Ceasefire Order Was Issued

The people of the whole country were delighted to hear that Chairman Chiang had issued an order to cease military conflicts, all believing that the situation would from then on have hope of improvement; at the same time, they were particularly concerned about the Chinese Communists' reaction. Everyone ultimately believed that the Chinese Communists could not remain indifferent to the government's repeated concessions; however, a Chinese Communist spokesperson still stated: "The 'cessation of other military actions' unilaterally announced by the Kuomintang government was neither consulted with the Communist Party representatives beforehand, and the exclusion of what is 'necessary for defending the existing area' can still be used as an excuse for all military actions. All the proposed measures in the political arena are far from the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and its procedures, therefore the future of the negotiations is truly not optimistic." This statement truly made the people of the whole country somewhat perplexed. The Chinese Communist Party's argument not only fails to be self-consistent, but also shows that the Chinese Communists have not been candid about peace talks and have not dispelled all suspicions, which is truly disappointing to us peace-loving people. However, the future development of the situation depends on the attitude of the Chinese Communists because the government has exhausted its ability to tolerate and concede, and has reached a point where it can no longer tolerate or concede. For the sake of the country and the nation, and also for the sake of the future of the Central and Northern regions, we still hope that the Chinese Communists will rein in at the edge of the cliff. Although the opportunity is urgent, there are still forty-eight hours. Within these forty-eight hours, we still look forward to Nanjing, waiting here at every moment for the good news of the Chinese Communists suddenly awakening.

Since the Japanese surrendered more than a year ago, our bandits and special agents were able to seize the opportunity to straighten up and start national construction, leading the country onto a bright and smooth path; instead, due to the issue between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, we have failed to get through the period of recovery and embark on the stage of revitalization. Time flies, wasting time again and again, which is truly a pity. The people of the whole country certainly hope for the realization of domestic peace and unification, and the government is even more eagerly seeking peace and seeking unification, but more than a year of peace talks has been like a nightmare, and everyone hopes that the Chinese Communists will quickly wake up from this nightmare. The past situation of the peace talks, let's put it aside for now, and let's look back at the changes in the overall situation in the most recent month, which can truly be described as unexpected twists and turns.

The Chinese Communists issued a statement on September 30, demanding that the government cease all military actions against Zhangjiakou, otherwise they would consider the peace talks to have broken down and would no longer be willing to continue holding them. Although the Chinese Communists' memorandum had the nature of a final ultimatum, the government still expressed tolerance and proposed two suggestions for resolving the situation, advocating that the Three-Person Conference and the Five-Person Group should meet at the same time, so that the two important issues of reorganizing the national government and the ceasefire method could be resolved simultaneously. However, the Chinese Communists repeatedly delayed this and ignored it, and the Yan'an Broadcasting Station announced the demands of the Chinese Communists, that is, demanding that the National Army withdraw from the areas recovered after January 13 of this year, otherwise the Chinese Communists would not participate in the negotiations to reorganize the government and would fight to the end. The Chinese Communists' attitude not only caused anxiety to the peace-loving people of the whole country, but also made the Allied mediators General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart feel deeply uneasy. However, General Marshall, with his indomitable spirit, treated the "dead horse as if it were a live one" and suggested to both sides that there be a ten-day ceasefire in Zhangjiakou. The government first expressed its agreement, but the Chinese Communists consistently refused and attacked General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart for favoring the government, saying that they were using delaying tactics for the government. Therefore, the peace talks were approaching a cliff and it was almost impossible to break the deadlock. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang delivered a radio address on National Day, expressing the government's desire for a political solution and always hoping for candid consultations, so that the door to peace talks remained open. The next day, the National Army recovered Zhangjiakou, and at the same time, the government issued an order to convene the National Assembly as scheduled, which suddenly caused the situation to take a turn for the worse and enter a new stage. The so-called "representatives of the third party" and social elites, in view of the tension of the situation, also came out to work for peace and mediate the opinions of both sides, in order to reopen the peace talks. Chairman Chiang also issued a statement on October 16, proposing eight measures for handling the current situation, which were enlightened and fair, and were unanimously supported by the people of the whole country, so that the Chinese Communist representatives who stayed in Shanghai had no choice but to go to Nanjing on the morning of October 21 to resume peace talks, which once again ignited a ray of hope for the people of the country, believing that the situation would definitely improve from then on. However, the Chinese Communists insisted on two conditions, so that the peace talks still remained deadlocked in the dispute between the "eight points" and the "two conditions." The Chinese Communists never responded to the government's eight points, until the Chinese Communist reply was handed over to the government representatives by Zhou Enlai through General Marshall the night before last, but the content of which is still unknown.

From the past of these peace talks, the attitude of the Chinese Communists has always been uncertain, and the arguments on which they are based are inevitably contradictory. For example, the Chinese Communists have been demanding a ceasefire for a long time; now that the government has automatically and unconditionally issued a ceasefire order, it is only natural for the Chinese Communists to not only express their welcome, but also to follow the government's lead and issue a ceasefire order as well; but the Chinese Communists say that the government unilaterally announced the ceasefire order, not only expressing their unwillingness to issue a ceasefire order, but also opposing the government's issuance of a ceasefire order. This self-contradictory statement only makes the people of the country understand the intentions of the Chinese Communists. The so-called facts speak louder than words. The Chinese Communists are so unpredictable. In the future, no matter how clever the propaganda methods adopted by the Chinese Communists, it will be difficult to convince the people. There is no need to say more.

As for the so-called "third party," they have indeed spent a lot of effort for peace in the past month, which is worthy of our admiration, but considering the opinions expressed by some representatives of the Democratic League regarding the government's issuance of the ceasefire order, they are still singing the same tune as the Chinese Communists, which is truly a pity for us. If such enlightened representatives are also unable to distinguish right from wrong, how can they avoid being suspected of blindly following? We hope that all parties can put the country and the nation first, and continue to work hard to persuade the Chinese Communists to issue a ceasefire order and submit a list of representatives to the National Assembly, so that representatives from all parts of the country and representatives from all parties can gather together on the birthday of the Founding Father. From a long-term perspective, they can discuss the fundamental law of the country and lay a solid foundation for the country's long-term plan.

### Opening of the National Industrial Association

The first National Congress of the China National Industrial Association after the victory was convened in the capital the day before yesterday; according to reported news, the task of this conference is to review the current industrial difficulties and plan future economic construction work. The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Congress recently closed in the capital, and now the National Industrial Association Congress is closely following, which can truly show that the national industry and commerce are deeply aware of the necessity of unity in order to seek the improvement of industry and commerce, which is indeed a commendable thing.

Speaking of Chinese industry, its equipment is outdated and its technology is backward, which cannot be compared with industrialized countries; but even our nascent industry has made great contributions to the country and the nation during the Anti-Japanese War. The relocation of Chinese factories to the interior is an epic story in the history of our Anti-Japanese War. Under the difficult circumstances in the interior, the situation was extremely difficult, but our nascent national industry supported the country's eight-year long War of Resistance. All of this spirit is truly worthy of our admiration.

Now, it has been more than a year since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, but the dangers faced by Chinese industry are even greater than during the war. The prevalence of usury, the massive import of cheap foreign goods, the difficulty in the supply of raw materials and electricity, the continuous increase in production costs, and the opposite continuous decline in production efficiency, as well as the failure to resume transportation smoothly, have all put Chinese industry in an extremely difficult situation. What was hoped for in the former Anti-Japanese War era has not only not been realized now, but its situation is even more difficult than during the war. This situation certainly cannot be allowed to continue; it is often heard that factories are closing down due to losses. How to promptly reverse this decline and revitalize the national industry is an urgent task for the government. From a passive point of view, the massive import of cheap foreign goods threatens the survival of our national industry. Although the government's collection of tariffs implies the intention of protecting our nascent national industry, its effect is not obvious. To this day, cheap foreign goods are everywhere on the market. At a time when the monetary system has not yet begun to be reorganized, how to effectively control imports is the key to saving our national industry. The popularity of usury makes it difficult for industrial funds to circulate. Therefore, from an active point of view, the government should fully provide Chinese industry with credit facilities, such as expanding the scope and quantity of industrial loans, so that China's nascent national industry will not be exhausted and decline. All of these are things that the government can do with its power, and the government should provide assistance.

As for the industrialization of China as a whole, not only should there be a meticulous plan, but it is also important to implement it in a timely manner. Currently, there is the so-called issue of state-owned versus private in the Chinese industrial community; in practice, this should not be considered an issue and be brought up for discussion. According to our highest guiding principle for nation-building, state-owned heavy industry and private light industry are established policies, with clear boundaries. There is no room for ambiguity. The main part of China's national industry is light industry, the daily necessities industry, that is, the industry that produces direct consumer goods, which belongs to the scope of private operation. The state originally had no intention of banning or prohibiting it. This is absolutely impossible for a country that prides itself on democratic progress. The Soviet Union's successive five-year plans centered on heavy industry, that is, the military industry; to this day, the people of the Soviet Union do not have enough products that can be directly consumed. Although the situation in our country is not exactly as we would like, our industrial community should have a necessary understanding, that is, only under the highest guiding principle of the Three Principles of the People for nation-building, can the existing foundation of China's national industry have its future.

### Shortage of Raw Materials and Heavy Costs: Wuxi Silk Factories Shut Down One After Another, Proposing Requirements to Save the Crisis of Collapse

[Report from Wuxi by Our Newspaper] Since the start of operations, silk factories in the city have been plagued by exceptionally heavy losses on autumn cocoons and slower production rates, leading to higher costs. Each dan of silk requires over 6 million yuan, while the government's limited price for purchasing raw silk is 3.8 million yuan, resulting in a loss of over 2 million yuan per dan. As a result, manufacturers are in a state of desperation and are on the verge of collapse. Recently, about 20-30% of the factories have successively shut down due to the lack of raw materials. The Sericulture Association of the Third District has discussed this serious issue and decided on the following points: (1) Given the excessive losses incurred by factories due to the high cost of autumn cocoons, the government is requested to purchase raw silk based on the cost of autumn cocoons. (2) Although 75,000 dan of Japanese cocoons have been allocated for transport to China, repeated negotiations with the government have yielded no progress. With factories facing a shortage of raw materials and shutting down one after another, the China Cocoon Corporation is requested to allocate dried cocoons to maintain the temporary situation. (3) The government is requested to send personnel to investigate the losses suffered by factories and rural areas during the period of Japanese occupation. (4) The cost of purchasing autumn cocoons for each factory has largely exceeded 60%, while the Autumn Cocoon Management Office still recognizes only 42%. An increase is requested. If no solution is found, most of the silk factories in Wuxi will shut down to avoid bankruptcy.

[Report from Wuxi by Our Newspaper] The local Cloth Industry Association has reported that cotton yarn used by dyeing and weaving factories is mostly obtained from the black market, resulting in extremely high prices and increased costs, which in turn have hindered sales and caused cloth prices to fall, leading to significant losses for each factory. The recent reorganization of the yarn distribution mechanism by the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Shanghai Ministry of Economic Affairs, along with improvements to the joint yarn distribution system, is expected to reduce costs and increase production for each factory. However, this yarn distribution system is only implemented by the China Textile Construction Company and local private yarn factories, and other private yarn factories in various regions have not joined. On the 7th, the association sent a special telegram to the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Shanghai Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting it to instruct the Cotton Textile Industry Association of the Sixth District and the Jiangsu-Anhui Yarn Factory Federation to allocate cotton yarn to cloth factories in various regions according to the joint yarn distribution system in order to provide relief and maintain production.

### Disaster Relief in Northeastern Anhui

Focusing Primarily on Shelters

[Report from Bengbu by Our Newspaper] The disaster situation in the counties of northeastern Anhui, affected by military disasters and floods, is extremely severe, and has become even more serious after the start of winter. The Anhui Relief Branch of the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration convened a relief conference for northeastern Anhui in Bengbu on the 6th. Representatives from 24 cities and counties, including Fengyang and Huaiyuan, attended. Important motions included: (1) A proposal to establish vocational training factories for the poor in the relief homes in the disaster-stricken counties. The method is based on accommodating up to 200 people for vocational training at the same time, divided into agriculture, horticulture, harvesting, metalworking, woodworking, leather, dyeing and weaving, etc., depending on local conditions. It was decided that the proposer, Fan Ren, would discuss the matter with the representative of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), Mr. 克 登, before making a decision. (2) Requesting the Relief Branch to allocate agricultural tools and fertilizers to improve agriculture and increase production. The method is to allocate a large number of agricultural tools and cattle to the flood-stricken areas and a large amount of fertilizer to the bandit-stricken areas. It was decided that the Branch would allocate from the requested materials to the counties. (3) Requesting the Relief Branch to establish standards for disaster relief. The method is to focus primarily on providing relief materials to shelters, to accommodate as many widowed, orphaned, lonely, and elderly people as possible, as well as infants and pregnant women, in order to reduce social unrest. The resolution was passed.

[Report from Jintan by Our Newspaper] The Wujin-Jintan section of the Wujin Highway (from 水 to Wujin) was once open to traffic, but was subsequently damaged by continuous autumn rains, causing traffic to be suspended for a month. Now, after the Jiangsu Provincial Highway Bureau actively carried out repairs, it has been restored to traffic for five days. There are three daily passenger buses running between Wujin and Jintan, with a total distance of 37 kilometers and a fare of 3,600 yuan.

[Report from Chuansha by Our Newspaper] In this county, in addition to the 上川 Railway, there are no existing highways, so transportation is still inconvenient. Recently, the county government planned to convert the 欽公塘 into a highway for automobiles. All the houses on the dam have been ordered to be demolished, and surveying work is in progress. The entire project is expected to be completed in three or four months.

[Report from Hefei by Our Newspaper] This summer, many bridges along the Hefei-Anqing Highway were washed away by mountain floods, especially the major bridges in the Tongcheng-Anqing section. Therefore, for several months, the vehicles of the Highway Bureau only traveled the section from Hefei to Tongcheng. Because the bridges in the Tongcheng-Anqing section have now been repaired, the entire Hefei-Anqing line will begin selling tickets on November 10. Only tickets to Tongcheng and Shucheng are sold along the way, and small stations are not served.

[Report from Suxian by Our Newspaper] The main highways of this county have been successively completed after being repaired under the supervision of the county government.

### Suzhou's Selling Price of Rice and Flour Must be Lower Than That of Shanghai According to Provincial Orders

[Report from Suzhou by Our Newspaper] The price limit for flour in this county has always been ordered to be determined by Mr. Wang Maogong, the Chairman of the Provincial Government , but flour manufacturers can only comply for a while, and soon it is nominal and the black market is rampant, which has caused strong resentment from all walks of life. Subsequently, the Taihe, Yuanhe, and Xinfeng flour mills filed a petition with the provincial government requesting permission to sell 20% of each factory's daily output at the limited price, and the rest at cost, because they claimed to be suffering heavy losses. The provincial government approved the request, as the request was deemed to be true. However, regarding the price of the remaining 80%, it was stipulated that it must be 5% to 15% lower than the limited price of flour in Shanghai. In addition, regarding the price issue, the provincial order also stipulated that the minimum price must be 5% to 15% lower than the price of rice in Shanghai.

### The Second Phase of Clearing Out Scattered Bandits in Taihu and Yangcheng Areas: Zhejiang Inland River Warships Patrol the Lake

[Report from Suzhou by Our Newspaper on the 9th] Our newspaper reporter visited the clearing command of Taihu and Yangcheng Lakes on the 9th to inquire about the progress of the clearing work. It was reported that the initial clearing and pacification work in the Taihu and Yangcheng areas was completed at the end of October. However, in order to thoroughly eliminate the scattered bandits, a second-phase clearing plan was formulated and is scheduled to be completed by the end of November. The characteristics of this plan are to use the police teams of the counties under its jurisdiction as the foundation, divide the areas into units of townships and villages, and simultaneously launch searches to clear out the hidden bandits, in order to thoroughly eliminate them. Compared with the past method of mobilizing by integrating small units into larger ones, this is a further step forward. Secondly, after the search and clearing work is perfected, preparations will be made to handle the joint guarantee and joint responsibility system for townships and villages, so as to make it a permanent solution. Now, the detailed rules of this clearing plan have been distributed to the counties of Su, Xi, Wu, , , and Tai for strict compliance.

### Wuxing Council Petitions to No Longer Increase Taxes

[Report from Wuxing by Our Newspaper] The County Council stated that the field tax for this year had already been agreed upon by local legal entities in early August by the Field Tax Office, and the rates had been verified and approved in accordance with the provincial office's transfer of the ministerial order. The actual levy was made at a discounted rate, and the string tickets were already completed. Now, an order has suddenly been received to change the string tickets, proposing to add a stamp to the tickets to collect the tax at a 64% discounted rate. The news that this year's field tax would be collected at a 50% discounted rate has already been widely known. If it is changed, the people will inevitably misunderstand, and this year there have been two major floods and wind and rain disasters, and the people are extremely poor. Therefore,顾省议员，凌县议长，长等 people were dispatched on the 6th to the 省 to petition to continue collecting the tax at the original discounted rate in order to alleviate the hardship of the people.

### Universal Establishment of Cooperatives in Reclaimed Counties of Northern Jiangsu; Illegitimate Ones to be Dissolved and Reorganized

[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang] Since the restoration, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has successively ordered all counties and cities to establish cooperative organizations to promote various cooperative undertakings. Now that the counties in northern Jiangsu have been gradually recovered, in order to stabilize order and restore local vitality as soon as possible, the Provincial Department of Social Affairs has formulated a "Set of Emergency Implementation Points for the Restoration of Cooperative Undertakings in the Pacification Zone of this Province," which has been passed and implemented by the Provincial Government's 66th regular meeting. Excerpts are as follows: (1) Cooperative organizations at all levels in the pacification zone counties must closely cooperate with the consolidation and demarcation of land, complete the work within a time limit, and ensure that all people join the cooperative. Each urban area should have an urban area cooperative, and each township should have a township cooperative. Urban area cooperatives or township cooperatives may set up branches within their business areas depending on their business conditions. (2) Counties in the pacification zone should accelerate the organization of county federations of cooperatives. For urgent business needs, they may start business operations in the name of a preparatory office. (3) Existing illegal cooperatives in the pacification zone will be dissolved and liquidated, and reorganized as county federations of cooperatives or urban and rural cooperatives depending on the situation. (4) Urban area cooperatives in the pacification zone should mainly engage in consumer business, supplying various daily necessities such as food, fuel, oil, salt, cloth, etc., and also handle cooperative factories and public housing cooperative businesses. Township cooperatives in the pacification zone should mainly engage in production, transportation, sales, and agricultural warehousing, and also handle consumer business. (5) County cooperative federations should be responsible for coordinating the cooperative business of urban and rural areas, and for the exchange of materials between them, and should assist lower-level cooperatives in developing various businesses. (6) Cooperative organizations at all levels in the pacification zone should cooperate with the government's economic policies to handle the transportation and sales of local specialties to prevent unscrupulous merchants from aiding the bandits, and should also find ways to fully supply military and civilian goods. (7) The prices of goods sold by cooperatives in the pacification zone should be lower than market prices in principle, and a voucher-based purchase system should be implemented to prevent malpractices.

Xiangde Road Needs Light

I live on Xiangde Road at the end of Shigaota Road. There used to be dozens of streetlights there, but they fell into disrepair after eight years of war. After peace, my neighbors and I applied to the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to install new bulbs. The company said that we needed to apply to the Public Utilities Bureau, but not long after, the streetlights there were all removed. Given the prosperity of this road and the large number of residents, especially the unevenness of the road surface, more streetlights should be added, but why is it now in complete darkness? I dare to ask for instructions so that we can see the light again. This is what the residents of Xiangde Road have been hoping for day and night. (Ouyang Wen)

Is an Order Needed to Return Prepaid Fees?

I am one of the low-income civil servants in this city. My young child is studying in a private middle school in this city. At the beginning of this semester, I paid the reserved fee as usual. When classes started, I presented the payment receipt from the bank designated by the school to obtain the class attendance certificate. Who knows that the tuition I paid was borrowed at high interest? When I paid the fee, I thought that the City Education Bureau had a meeting to exempt the tuition fees for the children of civil servants. I only needed the school to issue a notice or certificate, and the original tuition fee could be refunded. I would only lose a little interest. Who knew that in October, the civil servant fee exemption certificate for children of civil servants from the City Education Bureau was forwarded through my work unit. After verifying with the school, I requested a refund, but the school said that it had not received an order from the Education Bureau and ignored the matter. I think that as long as the certificate is not forged or altered, all public and private schools in this city have the obligation to comply with it and do not need a separate notification. However, my pleading was of no avail. I think there must be many other civil servants in the same situation as me. I would be very grateful if the education authorities could give clear instructions.

### No Results from Consecutive Meetings of Four Foreign Ministers; Trieste Issue Negotiated Outside of Meeting; Yugoslavia Expresses Willingness to Improve Relations with Western Countries

[United Press, New York, 9th] Western power diplomats here said today that if Italy and Yugoslavia can find a new way to resolve the issue of the Port of Trieste, the Four Foreign Ministers Conference can immediately abandon its plan for international co-management of the port. The Four Foreign Ministers met for four hours and forty minutes today and decided to set aside the Trieste issue and proceed to discuss the treaties with Italy and Romania. There was no result from the discussion on the Danube navigation clause in the Romanian treaty. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov opposed including this clause in the treaty but expressed willingness to discuss it separately. British Foreign Minister Bevin said that the free navigation of the Danube, whether guaranteed by a treaty or any other means, is irrelevant. However, Britain, which has fought for the longest time, does not want to sacrifice all its rights in the war. US Secretary of State Byrnes supported Bevin's opinion. There will be no formal meetings on the weekend of the 9th and 10th to allow representatives to negotiate informally. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Byrnes is preparing to watch a large-scale football game.

[Associated Press, New York, 8th] The Four Great Powers Foreign Ministers decided tonight in an emergency motion to postpone the discussion of the Trieste issue indefinitely. It is widely believed that informal, non-public negotiations may be conducted outside the conference on this serious issue. The above suggestion was made by Byrnes at the fourth Foreign Ministers meeting today. Prior to making this motion, Byrnes met with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Simic and Yugoslav Ambassador to the United States Kosanovic. It was also only one day after Yugoslav Marshal Tito announced that he would exchange the Port of Trieste for Gorizia.

[Reuters, New York, 8th] Yugoslav Foreign Minister Simic expressed to British Foreign Minister Bevin here today that Yugoslavia is willing to improve relations with Western countries and satisfactorily resolve the issue of the Port of Trieste and the southern Italian border to eliminate the causes of permanent friction. Authoritative sources said that Simic did not present Yugoslavia's recent new proposal to exchange Gorizia for the Port of Trieste. He also did not mention this proposal when he met with US Secretary of State Byrnes yesterday, which proves that the Yugoslav delegation in New York has not been instructed to present this matter to the Foreign Ministers Conference. It is also learned that M. Mauvais, representing French Foreign Minister Bidault, also met with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Simic and Italian Ambassador to the United States Gallarati this morning, and it is thought that Simic did not formally present Marshal Tito's recent new proposal.

[United Press, New York, 9th] In view of the recent developments in various aspects, diplomats here are speculating that the Trieste issue, which has been in a stalemate for a long time, may be resolved. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Simic, accompanied by the Yugoslav Ambassador to the United States, visited US Secretary of State Byrnes for consultations. The content is unknown, but diplomatic circles believe that it may be discussing the Trieste issue. According to those familiar with the situation of the Foreign Ministers Conference here, the statement made by the Yugoslav representative at the Foreign Ministers Conference on Wednesday regarding the Trieste issue was more moderate in tone, and public opinion still attaches great importance to it. Its tone is completely different from the situation when the Yugoslav delegation withdrew from the peace conference in Paris due to the Trieste issue.

[United Press, Beijing, 8th] The Belgian News Agency announced that the Grand Duke of Luxembourg has requested the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to approve Luxembourg's eastern border with Germany. It is reported that Luxembourg has requested to modify the border between the areas of Moehnthal and Somme.

### Tito's New Proposal: Unwilling to Allow the Port of Trieste to be Controlled by Britain and the United States

[Reuters, Trieste, 8th] A communist newspaper in Trieste published a statement by Babic, Secretary-General of the "Italian-Slovene Anti-Fascist Alliance of Trieste," accusing Britain and the United States of planning to use the Port of Trieste as a base for imperialist aggression to resist the development of democratic forces in Italy and Yugoslavia and all democratic forces in Eastern Europe. Tito's new proposal, which allows Italy to retain the Port of Trieste and allows Yugoslavia to obtain Gorizia, can prevent imperialists from taking advantage of the conflict between southern Italy and Yugoslavia and reaping the benefits. According to this first comment from Yugoslav figures on Tito's new proposal, the Tito government would rather allow defeated Italy to retain the Port of Trieste than allow the United Nations to control the area. Pro-Tito figures here also informally claimed that they believe that Tito's proposal that Italy retain the Port of Trieste is conditional on the Port of Trieste being a demilitarized zone and that a democratic government be established in the area in accordance with the ten-point proposal previously made by the "Italian-Slovene Anti-Fascist Alliance." In addition, Yugoslavia may also request the coastal area west of the Port of Trieste to Monfalcone to be ceded to Yugoslavia. If this happens, the Port of Trieste will become an Italian island within Yugoslav territory. The Italian National Liberation Committee of Venezia Giulia has now issued a public statement in response to the Roman government's rejection of Tito's new proposal.

### Proper Distribution of UN Relief Supplies Demanded by China

[Central News Agency, New York, 8th] The United Nations Economic and Financial Committee began discussing the world food situation today. Chinese representative Zhang Pengchun spoke at the meeting, demanding that relief supplies be properly distributed without considering transportation and political issues. Zhang Pengchun described the current agricultural situation in China, which has been affected by the war, especially the situation of rice production. Since China is a rice-producing country, in terms of global relief efforts, "rice-producing countries are not as valued as wheat-producing countries." Zhang said that China has suffered greatly because other countries have more convenient transportation. Therefore, Zhang declared that China will propose suggestions emphasizing the need to quickly distribute existing relief supplies.

### South Africa's Annexation of Southwest Africa Opposed by Two South American Countries

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 8th] The United Nations General Assembly Trusteeship Council recently held a meeting where representatives from Haiti and Guatemala expressed their opposition to the South African Union's annexation of Southwest Africa. The Czech representative also said that it would be unwise to try to resolve this issue hastily.

### The United States Does Not Intend to Take Strong Action Against the Franco Regime; The Byelorussian Proposal Will Be Rejected

[Report] San Francisco, 9th Radio: The United Nations General Assembly met today to discuss the Byelorussian proposal. The Byelorussian representative requested the United Nations to impose economic sanctions on the Franco regime. It is under discussion, but the US side has informally stated in advance that it will not endorse any coercive action. It is expected that the Byelorussian proposal will be rejected.

[Reuters, New York, 7th] It is reported that the United States is not yet prepared to take strong action against Franco's Spain, such as the economic sanctions proposed by Byelorussia. The US delegation attending the United Nations conference discussed this entire issue today and believes that now is not the time to take decisive action. However, the discussion did not result in a definite resolution. The matter will continue to be discussed next week.

### The United States Decides to Continue to Fully Support UN Agencies

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 8th] US Senator Vandenberg's landslide victory in this election has placed him at the forefront of Republican presidential candidates. Vandenberg said today at the United Nations Budget Committee that regardless of whether the future US president belongs to the Republican or Democratic Party, the United States will fully support the United Nations. He said: "Regardless of the political system in Washington, the United States will continue to fully support the United Nations. The United States government is determined to cooperate sincerely with all countries to strive for a system of mutual prevention of aggression through the United Nations agencies, to achieve peace and justice, and to promote the welfare of the world."

### Applications for New Members Should Be Reviewed

Gu Weijun Speaks at the UN General Assembly

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 9th] Gu Weijun, chief representative of China, said yesterday afternoon at the Political and Security Committee meeting that the Chinese government believes that the General Assembly should request the Security Council to review the membership applications of five countries. The applications of these five countries were previously rejected by the Security Council. Among them, the applications of Ireland, Portugal, and Jordan were rejected by the Soviet Union using its veto power. The applications of Albania and Outer Mongolia were rejected by Britain and the United States. Gu said that China, in its capacity as a permanent member of the Security Council, supports the view that the General Assembly should not take action on the issue of new member states without a recommendation from the Security Council. However, there are different interpretations of the United Nations Charter on this point. The Chinese delegation believes that the Security Council should take a more liberal view of this article in the Charter. China supports allowing all five countries to be listed as candidate member states in order to accelerate the admission of qualified countries. To say that an applicant country should be refused candidate status because it does not maintain relations with several countries is beyond the provisions of the Charter. In short, the Security Council needs to review the rejected applications of the five countries.

Britain Has Not Established Diplomatic Relations with Outer Mongolia

[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] A spokesman for the British Foreign Office said today in response to a reporter's question on whether the People's Republic of Outer Mongolia would be allowed to join the United Nations that the People's Republic of Outer Mongolia has never attempted to establish diplomatic relations with Britain, and conversely, Britain has never attempted to establish diplomatic relations with Outer Mongolia. Britain has always believed that it cannot support the application of countries that have not established diplomatic relations with Britain to join United Nations agencies.

Rejecting the Membership of Portugal and Ireland

The Soviet Union States Its Reasons

[Central News Agency, New York, 7th] Soviet representative Gromyko proposed a new standard for the qualifications of those applying to join the United Nations today at the Political and Security Committee. He argued that the committee should consider the applicant country's behavior and attitude during World War II. Gromyko gave a lengthy speech explaining the Soviet Union's views. In response to the attacks by various small countries in recent days, he defended the Soviet Union's rejection of the applications of Ireland, Jordan, and Portugal, and explained the reasons why the applications of Albania and Outer Mongolia should be approved.

### The United States Decides to Withdraw Its Political Representative to Albania

Unable to Find a Way to Obtain Recognition from Albania

[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th, Associated Press] The US State Department announced that the US government has been unable to find a way to recognize Albania and will withdraw its political representation to that country. It is said that the Hoxha government refused to recognize the treaties between the US government and the former Albanian King Zog I, and the US government believes that the representation to Albania no longer serves a purpose.

### US Naval Authorities Study Pacific Defense Plan; Britain, the US, and Canada Discuss Joint Arctic Defense

[United Press, Honolulu, 8th] US Pacific Fleet Commander Towers said here today that the US Naval High Command is studying the entire Pacific defense plan, including the fortification of Guam, in order to revise the plan and engage in post-war construction in a realistic and economic way. Towers believes that the US Navy and the federal government will face inevitable budget reduction plans during this period. However, building Guam into a strong base, according to the plan he supports, does not cost much. Some parties propose to spend up to one billion US dollars on a five-year plan to make Guam a second Pearl Harbor. Naval authorities in Washington are currently studying a plan that would allow Guam to be built to meet limited peacetime needs, but the basic engineering work would allow for rapid expansion of its naval facilities in the event of an emergency.

[Reuters, London, 7th] Related parties believe that the reason for the visit to the United States by Major General Laycock, Commander of the British Joint Operations Forces, is to inform the US side of the British view on the US requisitioning of Canadian bases. Marshal Brooke and Marshal Montgomery are understood to have held preliminary talks with US and Canadian military leaders on this matter during their recent visits to North America. The United States originally intended to defend the Arctic with Canada at the same time. The United States hopes that Canada will establish a chain of air force bases to strengthen its northern defense. Britain believes that Canada cannot complete this task without substantial financial assistance from the United States. One of the reasons for the current informal negotiations is to raise funds and use labor and raw materials. People here say that the discussion of this proposal is the first job after Alexander was appointed Minister of Defense.

### The United States Controls the Trusteeship Islands of Japan

Australia Must Retain Control over New Guinea Bases

[Central News Agency, 8th, Associated Press] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, when reporting on Australia's foreign policy to Parliament, fully supported President Truman's plan to have the United States control the former Japanese trusteeship islands and other conquered enemy strongholds in the Pacific as part of the United States' defense plan under the United Nations trusteeship system. Australia is also very willing to allow the United States to retain naval and air bases on Manus Island, but the only condition is that Australia must retain full control over New Guinea. Australia welcomes the United States' trusteeship of the Caroline Islands and the Marshall Islands, and the fortification of these islands for the general security of the Pacific. We are very willing to enter into an agreement with the United States to mutually use Manus Island, that is, Australia retains control, but allows the United States to use its bases, and Australia can also use its bases in other areas controlled by the United States.

### US Government Convenes Cabinet Meeting

### Japan Reparations Issue May Fall into Stalemate; Possible Submission for Discussion by Four Foreign Ministers; Supervisory Committee on Japan to Confer on US and Soviet Proposals

[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] Regarding the distribution of Japanese assets as compensation for Allied reparations, it is rumored that the US State Department has invited member states of the Far Eastern Commission to negotiate this issue with the US government. The State Department's proposal argues that the Far Eastern Commission should continue its work even if the Soviet Union refuses to participate. Although the Soviet Union has not yet submitted its reparations demands in detail, the US State Department has a complete list of all Japanese materials that the Soviet Union removed from Northeast China and Korea as "war booty." This list was obtained by Truman's reparations commissioner, Pauley, during his investigation in Northeast China and Korea several months ago. Therefore, the US government proposes that if the Soviet Union refuses to participate in the reparations committee, the reparations committee should determine the amount of reparations due to the Soviet Union, deduct the materials it removed from Northeast China and Korea, and then invite the Soviet Union to claim the remaining balance by a set date, otherwise, it will not be able to make any further demands. Once the Far Eastern Commission falls into a stalemate, it may be submitted for discussion at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. China will also send a representative to attend, as the Far Eastern Commission was established in accordance with the agreement passed at the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference last December.

[Remodeling Company, Tokyo, 9th] The Allied Control Council for Japan will meet on the 13th to review the following issues: (1) Members of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives who violate the purge order against militarists (Soviet proposal); (2) The scope of issues that the Control Council for Japan can review (US proposal). The first issue was raised at the last meeting and it was decided to continue the discussion.

### Bernays Requests Ban on Promotion of Atomic Bomb Warfare; State Department Approves US Warship Visits to Turkish and Greek Ports

[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 9th Radio: US Secretary of State Bernays will request President Truman to prohibit US Army and Navy leaders from promoting atomic bomb warfare, as such promotion makes peace talks difficult. Recently, the commanders-in-chief of the US Army and Navy have promoted that the B-36 aircraft can carry atomic bombs to any corner of the world. Due to opposition from the State Department, the US B-29's plan to travel around the world has been temporarily canceled.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 9th] The State Department has approved three US warships to visit ports in Greece and Turkey, which is tantamount to having US warships sail behind the Soviet Union's back door. Knowledgeable sources have thus become newly interested in speculating about the possibility of the US Superfortress aircraft groups flying around the world. This flight plan was canceled at the request of the State Department, but knowledgeable sources believe that the War Department has not abandoned the ideal of a world cruise. Army aviator Colonel Eielson, famous for flying over the Arctic, recently told reporters that he was prepared to lead Superfortress aircraft to fly over Moscow at the request of the State Department, "to support our country's diplomatic policy." However, Air Force Chief of Staff Spaatz replied to questions about this statement, saying that Eielson was a junior officer and his statement was not of an official nature.

### New Shanghai County Magistrate to Take Office Tomorrow

[This Newspaper] Former Shanghai County Magistrate Xu Jinyu has been transferred to Songjiang, and the new Shanghai County Magistrate Ni Younian is scheduled to take office tomorrow. According to the Shanghai County, before the establishment of the Special Knock City, there were originally nineteen districts and townships. When the urban area was divided, the essence was all returned to the urban area, and the county government only had three districts west of the Huangpu River and two districts east of the Huangpu River. During the period of the Japanese occupation, the puppet government once abolished the county and renamed it Beiqiao District, which belonged to Shanghai City. Later, due to the division of provinces and cities, it was renamed Shenjiang County. After the victory, the original name was restored, and it still governs five districts. On the west side of the Huangpu River, the first district is Minhang Heqi, the second district is Tangwan Caohang, and the third district is Zhuanqiao Beiqiao Maqiao. On the east side of the Huangpu River, the first district is Sanlin and the second district is Chenxing. According to recent statistics, the total number of residents in the county is 118,663, with 250,000 mu of farmland, and cotton is the main agricultural product, followed by rice. There is a saying among the villagers: "Seven cottons and three rice." The county government was located on Penglai Road in the Nanshi area before 1929, and then moved to Beiqiao. Due to the damage to the houses during the war, it has now moved to the former district office in Minhang Town North.

### Japanese Riki Maru Arrives Carrying Exchange Materials; Can Be Allowed to Enter After Japanese Flag Is Removed

### Enduring Dedication to China: Mr. Hollington Tong, Who Feared No Tyranny and Strove for Truth, Lived as a Friend of China and Wished to Rest in This Land After Death

[Special Report from This Newspaper] "I want to go back to China! I want to die in China!" Mr. Hollington Tong, a devoted friend of China and a prominent foreign resident, upon learning of his "incurable" fate from doctors in Tahiti, in the Pacific, this spring, unhesitatingly made his final decision.

Today, Mr. Tong has achieved his wish. He will rest peacefully in the soil of China, with the dewdrops of Chinese grass adorning his resting place.

Mr. Tong, at the age of seventy-one, dedicated his life to two words: "Truth." After arriving in Shanghai via Honolulu on March 18th of this year, Mr. Tong resided in a quiet ward on the third floor of the Country Hospital. The sunlight of early spring peeked through the cracks in the window, illuminating his bedside. Mr. Tong, his eyes fixed on those rays of light, told reporters: "People must not only know 'Truth,' but also seek 'Truth,' and even strive for 'Truth.'"

For forty-four years, Mr. Tong struggled, worked hard, and suffered for China and for humanity, all to achieve the purpose of his life.

Youth

Hollington Tong was born on June 20, 1875, in a large family in a small city in New South Wales, Australia. His father, a railroad contractor, hoped that his son would also become a railroad engineer. However, Tong was determined to pursue a career in journalism. Perhaps it was fate, or perhaps it was misfortune, but Tong injured his arm while playing with friends as a child, and from then on, he could no longer work with iron or repair machines. At the age of fifteen or sixteen, he entered a printing shop as a typesetter. Soon after, he became a reporter for a newspaper.

From Hong Kong to Shanghai after the Russo-Japanese War, Appointed as English Secretary by Dr. Sun Yat-sen

In 1902, the "China Mail," an English newspaper in Hong Kong, was looking to expand significantly, but the editor-in-chief was constantly worried and anxious because he couldn't find good reporters. None of the reporters he hired could resist the temptation of alcohol. With no other choice, the editor-in-chief could only send someone to Australia to scout for talent. The person chosen was Hollington Tong. Thus, he came to China and brought great achievements to the country.

Tong did not disappoint the editor-in-chief of the "China Mail," nor did he disappoint himself. He embarked on the road to success. The "China Mail" prospered day by day, becoming the largest newspaper in Hong Kong. In 1905, at the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War, Tong served as a war correspondent for the New York Tribune. After the war ended, he joined the Shanghai English-language Far Eastern Review, writing articles. At that time, Rodney Gilbert, the chief writer of the Far Eastern Review, was a close friend of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. By chance, Gilbert introduced Tong to Dr. Sun. Dr. Sun was delighted to have such a friend who was greatly interested in Chinese politics and had exceptionally sincere revolutionary ideas, so he hired him as his English secretary. Tong not only helped Dr. Sun and China, but also helped the world. With revolutionary spirit, he traveled to Hong Kong, Shanghai, and overseas, promoting the revolutionary movement and enabling foreigners and Chinese people to gain a correct and new understanding of the current situation.

Forty Years of Foreign Residence on the Chinese Political Stage

From then on, Tong began his life as a foreign resident. In the forty years of his involvement in the Chinese political arena, every scene of change bore his contribution and his achievements. Several major events in Chinese history, such as the campaign against Yuan Shikai, China's participation in World War I, his persuasion of Zhang Zuolin to join the Northern Expedition, and even the Xi'an Incident, saw his direct or indirect involvement. His greatest effort was to publish the Twenty-One Demands proposed by Japan to the world through news reports, exposing the Japanese invaders' ambition to annex China to all countries.

In 1928, Tong met Zhang Xueliang through an introduction and was appointed as his advisor. The Young Marshal Zhang valued this wise mentor greatly, and from him, he gained a deeper political understanding and national consciousness. During this period, he persuaded Zhang and his father, indirectly assisting in the success of the Northern Expedition. In 1930, after the Northeast Flag Replacement, Tong accompanied Zhang Xueliang on a trip to Europe. Due to the influence of his sincere personality, the once pleasure-seeking Young Marshal broke away from his dark past.

Something the Chinese People Should All Be Grateful For

When Tong was with Dr. Sun, he had the opportunity to become acquainted with the Song sisters. "Uncle Tong" was always a respected and approachable figure in the Song sisters' impressions. In 1934, Tong returned to China from Europe and was introduced to Chiang Kai-shek by Madame Chiang. Chiang's wise and insightful governance deeply moved Tong, enabling him to express his opinions frankly and boldly, and to introduce the political thoughts of various European and American countries to Chiang. When the Xi'an Incident occurred, Tong volunteered and insisted on going north to serve Chiang. On December 25th of that year, Chiang safely escaped danger, becoming a major turning point in modern Chinese political history. This was naturally due to Chiang's virtue and prestige, but Tong's fearless contribution is also something that every Chinese person should be grateful for.

As time passed, Tong felt that his twilight years were approaching, and he needed to rest. In 1939, he went to Hong Kong and built a boat to begin his travels. Among the islands in the Pacific Ocean, with the vast sky and sea, Tong enjoyed a leisurely retirement in his secluded paradise. However, he remembered an unfinished task: to write a detailed memoir. But after returning to Tahiti, he was unable to write. Because he knew that in this politically turbulent era, his historical and political accounts, if not carefully written, could affect the overall situation. Therefore, he dared not write lightly.

Unrecognized in the Concentration Camp

In the years of Tong's retirement, Chiang and his wife constantly remembered him, hoping that he would return. Tong also couldn't forget China, so in the winter of 1941, he decided to return west. Unfortunately, when he arrived in Manila, the Pearl Harbor Incident occurred, and Tong became a prisoner in the Santo Tomas Internment Camp. In the concentration camp, the enemy only knew that there was an elderly retired businessman named Tong, and did not know his true identity. After several tense and dangerous situations, Tong luckily remained unrecognized. Chiang and his wife, far away in Chongqing, knew about this and were anxious day and night. As soon as the Philippines was liberated, they immediately consulted with the US military authorities and sent paratroopers to rescue him. When he returned to his old residence in Tahiti for the third time, Mr. Tong's physical strength was exhausted, and he weighed forty pounds less than before. Chiang asked the US Navy to send a special plane to take him to the United States for examination, where he was found to have a terrible disease: cancer. However, Mr. Tong was not afraid. He regarded death as a return and only asked to return to his second hometown: China. When he first arrived in Shanghai, doctors said that he could only live for two more months, but after careful treatment, Tong was fortunate enough to bring us six more months of warmth. Even in his illness, he still roused his spirits, reading books and newspapers every day, and chatting with a few close friends about world affairs.

A Medal Given to Him by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Considered the Most Cherished Treasure of His Life

During his illness, he constantly thought about Chiang Kai-shek and Madame Chiang. Two days before his death, although he could no longer speak, he did not want to die before seeing Madame Chiang. Chiang Kai-shek made a special trip from Taiwan to visit him. Madame Chiang met with him for the last time before his death. Tong nodded and smiled at her. He was satisfied. He will forever smile in the afterlife.

Tong had no estate and no belongings. He left his family early and separated from his wife. He had only one daughter, who is now in Australia. The most precious treasure of his life was the medal given to him by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Mr. Tong was a representative of "Truth." He was unwilling to compromise with the environment, and he was not afraid of the threat of evil forces. At the same time, he was also a firm and resolute person. The fact that he lived in China for more than forty years without ever eating Chinese food shows his upright and strong will.

Rest in peace, devoted friend of China! Today, those who come to the Universal Funeral Parlor to pay their respects to Mr. Tong will deeply remember his motto: "People must not only know 'Truth,' but also seek 'Truth,' and even strive for 'Truth.'"

### Zhu Bin of Li New Handkerchief Factory, Guilty of Continuously Inciting Strikes

Zhu Bin Sentenced to One Year and Two Months in Prison

[Report from This Newspaper] Zhu Bin, a worker at the Li New Handkerchief Factory, is a representative of the handkerchief industry union in this city. In March of this year, because his request to the company for increased wages and improved treatment was not granted, he incited workers to strike for thirty-six days. Later, after mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, an agreement was signed, but the company could not accept the item of paying wages on Sundays. Therefore, Zhu Bin gathered the workers and added incitement, attempting to strike again. The police department arrested Zhu and sent him to the District Prosecutor's Office. The prosecutor believed that Zhu Bin had violated Article 30 of the Provisional Regulations for the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry and Commerce in Times of Emergency, so he filed a public prosecution according to law. The case was concluded yesterday in the sixth criminal court of the District Court. Judge Zhong announced in court: "Zhu Bin is sentenced to one year and two months of imprisonment for continuously inciting strikes and slowdowns."

### Using Career as Bait, Defrauding Large Sums of Money, Unemployed Friends Are Fooled, Asking for Money at Home and Falsely Accusing Them of Being Hoodlums, Harming Others and Harming Themselves, Arrested

[Report from This Newspaper] Le Jiafa, a 25-year-old from Ningbo, whose uncle Zhang Rujin is a park police officer in Fuxing Park, often went to the park for sightseeing, and thus met fifteen tourists including Mei LiangKang and Mei A Liang. They were on the same wavelength, and got on like a house on fire at first sight. Le Jiafa falsely claimed that he had been admitted to the Jianghai Customs and would be the captain of the anti-smuggling brigade in the future, and a group of unemployed friends were overjoyed when they heard the news, and asked him for help to find a job. At this point, Le Jiafa used his silver tongue, saying that the captain could employ thirty or forty team members, and the salary of each team member was generous, but currently, he needed to entertain important officials of the Jianghai Customs, such as Bai Linan and George, and the entertainment expenses were huge. He asked them to raise money for assistance. At that time, Mei LiangKang and others did not suspect fraud. They were full of hope of finding a job, so they pooled money together. From the end of September to the end of last month, they were defrauded of more than eight hundred yuan. However, because the time had passed for a long time, there was no action, so they became suspicious and inquired one after another. Who knew that Le only made appointments and delayed the time? Until the afternoon of the fourth of this month, Le had them meet at Fuxing Park again, and he still adopted a perfunctory attitude. So Mei and others asked for the paid money, and Le saw that the situation was not good, and agreed to return the advance at his home at 8:00 pm the night before. Who knew that Le would report to the Xincheng Police Station, falsely accusing a large number of hoodlums of trying to extort money, etc. The police station immediately ordered Song Bingzheng, the chief of the criminal section, to lead the police officers to rush to the scene, and arrested fifteen people including Mei LiangKang, Mei Ayou, Lu Guosheng, Yang Lianheng, E Gaobao, Fan Chengfu, Mei Wenbiao, Xia Zhenya, Ni Zhenyu, and Mei Yongxing. However, after interrogation, they found out the inside story. At this point, a group of unemployed people were greatly outraged. The police station turned around and arrested Le and transferred him to the District Prosecutor's Office for fraud.

### Appraisal Committee Holds Meeting to Discuss Five Labor Disputes

[Report from This Newspaper] The Shanghai Labor Appraisal Committee held its fifth meeting in the conference room of the Social Affairs Bureau at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Those present were Wu Kaixian, Tan Yulin, Shen Baoyu, Xu Jichan, Zhang Wei, Zhao Zengjue (representing Li Kaidi), Zhu Xuefan (representing Shui Xiangyun), Liu Jingji and other more than ten people. The following cases were discussed: 1. Regarding the issue of the shoe industry company's request to reduce wages, because it is too related, it is planned to expand the investigation before making a concrete decision. The three methods originally scheduled for discussion are: one is that wages are not reduced, the second is that they are partially reduced, and the third is that they are generally reduced. 2. Regarding the clothing issue of the gas company's workers, it was decided that it should be based on the needs of each person's work. If it is really needed, the company will issue a set of work clothes every year. 3. The case of the silk weaving industry company requesting to reduce wages, because the situation in the silk weaving industry is currently improving and raw materials are also allocated, so it was decided to alleviate the discussion. 4. The issue of year-end holidays still needs to be seriously considered, and it is recommended that the ministry approve it. 5. Sun Wenqing, a worker at the China Aluminum Steel Plant, is allowed to transfer jobs and his salary remains unchanged.

Regarding the point that the living index in this city is different from the price index in Nanjing, Wu Kaixian made a report. The base wage for workers in Nanjing is 60 cents per day and 18 yuan per month. It is calculated by discounting according to the Shanghai worker index. The meeting adjourned at six o'clock.

### Shanghai Tries Traitor Cases, First Execution, Traitor Liang Hongzhi Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday, Two Letters Stated That He Was Not Convinced of the Failure of His Political Career, He Was Calm at the Execution Ground and Died with One Shot

[Report from This Newspaper] Liang Hongzhi, the head of the puppet Reformed Government, was executed by firing squad in the Shanghai Prison execution ground at 1:22 PM yesterday. This is the first traitor to be sentenced to death and executed in this city after the victory.

According to the report, since Liang was sentenced to death by the Shanghai High Court, his family hired a defense lawyer to file a petition with the Supreme Court, applying for a retrial. Later, the Supreme Court ruled to uphold the original verdict. Yesterday, the Supreme Prosecutor's Office suddenly received an execution order from the Nanjing Supreme Prosecutor's Office. At 11:40 AM, Prosecutor Zai Rongqian issued a warrant to bring Liang out of cell No. 23 in Zhongjian Prison and escorted him to the attached execution ground. Liang was wearing a black woolen robe, blue silk ankle-length trousers, purplish-brown gauze socks, and white-soled black direct-real woolen shoes. His complexion was white and plump, and his attitude was white. Prosecutor Dai and the bailiffs arrived at the execution ground at 11:50 AM. After verifying his identity, they asked him if he had any last words. Liang replied that he had not yet received the judgment from the Supreme Court, so why should he be executed so quickly. His words seemed to indicate that he was not convinced. Prosecutor Dai told him that he was acting on the orders of his superiors. Liang's face turned slightly gray when he heard this, but he was still very calm. He then requested that his family be notified after his death and asked for paper and pen to write a will. He finished writing from 12:00 to 1:15, writing three sheets of ten lines each. In the letter to his family, he said: I have read poetry and books all my life, but now my political career has failed. Today, I died in extreme punishment. Come and collect my body as soon as you get the news. My family is poor, so there is no need to be extravagant in my funeral. I hope you will be frugal in the future. In another letter to President Chiang, he still defended himself, saying: He formed the puppet government not to seek personal fame and wealth, but to save the people from the fire and water, which is the same as the ideals of ordinary politicians. Now I have been sentenced to death for failure, and it is difficult to accept. He was calm when writing, and did not show any panic. After writing, he still asked to hand over a pocket watch and clothes to his family. He took out a jade fish from his bag, about three inches long, inlaid with ivory and jade. He claimed that this was a relic of his late teacher and asked to be handed over to his family for burial. After speaking, he stepped forward and sat on a yellow-backed wooden chair. At 1:20, Prosecutor Dai gave an order. At 1:22, bailiff Wang Junhua fired a shot from behind Liang's back. The bullet entered from the back of his head and exited from his mouth. He immediately fell to the left side of the chair, collapsed on the ground and died. His right eye was closed tightly, his left eye was protruding, his figure-eight eyebrows were upside down, and fresh blood kept gushing out from the gunshot hole in his mouth. After Prosecutor Dai verified that it was correct, the bailiff covered it with a grassy green US military blanket, but the red blood still seeped through this thick blanket. After the matter was completed, the High Prosecutor's Office notified his family to collect the body, and immediately issued a public announcement at the gate of the Shanghai Prison. At 3:00, the corpse was put into a thin wooden coffin by the Pushan Villa and sent to the corpse inspection office on Jiaozhou Road. In the evening, his family rushed to the scene after receiving the news and transported the corpse to the China Funeral Home for temporary placement and viewing.

### Supreme Court Judgment: Defendant Slanders the Central Government and Destroys the Nation; Extreme Punishment Is Necessary to Serve as a Stern Warning

Liang is currently sixty-four years old and a native of Changle, Fujian. The Supreme Court's judgment listed Liang's crimes, stating: "The defendant initially served as a State Council Counselor and Senator in the Beijing government, as well as Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan. After the success of the Northern Expedition by the National Revolutionary Army and the establishment of the capital in Nanjing, he retired to Hangzhou. At the beginning of the War of Resistance against Japan in 1937, he moved to Shanghai. Subsequently, when Nanjing and Shanghai fell into enemy hands, and the government moved the capital to Chongqing, the defendant seized the opportunity to collude with Wen Zongyao, Chen Jintao, Chen Lu, and others to communicate with the enemy and plan for the establishment of a puppet regime in Central China. On March 28, 1938, the puppet Reformed Government was established in Nanjing, issuing a declaration and establishing two houses and eight ministries, governing three provinces and two cities. He appointed himself the puppet President of the Executive Yuan, overseeing everything, and changed the national flag to the Five-Colored Flag.

He presided over the political council, recruited troops, seized customs, and successively signed railway, telecommunications, salt affairs, and banking agreements with the enemy chieftains. He operated the Central China Railway, Telecommunications, Salt Industry, and Shipping Companies, as well as the China Development Bank, in collaboration with the enemy. Furthermore, he conferred with Wang Kemin, the head of the puppet Provisional Government in North China, in September 1938, to establish the Joint Committee of the Puppet Chinese Government, jointly issuing a declaration. In November of the same year, he traveled to the enemy country to visit key military and political figures, in order to establish connections. After returning to China, he published his impressions of his visit to Japan. In April 1939, when Wang Jingwei betrayed the party and the nation and secretly came to Shanghai to establish a puppet National Government, the defendant, after numerous consultations with Wang and Wang, jointly issued a declaration in the name of the puppet Reformed Government and the Provisional Government on September 21st and 23rd of the same year, respectively, echoing Wang's

advocacy of the peace movement. In January of the following year, a meeting was held in Qingdao, jointly deciding to organize the puppet Central Political Council. On March 20th, another meeting was held in Nanjing, resolving the adjustment plan for Sino-Japanese relations. When the puppet National Government was formally established in the capital, they jointly issued a so-called declaration of returning to the capital and the political program of the puppet national government. At the same time, the puppet Reformed Government and Provisional Government declared their dissolution, and the defendant was reassigned as the President of the puppet Supervisory Yuan and a member of the puppet Central Political Council. On November 20, 1944, due to Wang's death from illness, Chen Gongbo succeeded as Chairman of the puppet National Government, and the defendant then took over as the President of the puppet Legislative Yuan until the surrender of the Japanese invaders."

### Refuting Reasons for Reconsideration

The Supreme Court refuted Liang's reasons for requesting a reconsideration, stating: "If the defendant truly possessed the zeal to save the country and the people and had the determination to make great sacrifices, even if he could not take up arms to kill the enemy, how difficult would it have been to secretly infiltrate the rear to serve the central government in order to strengthen the forces of resistance and nation-building? Or, he could have lived in seclusion, biding his time, quietly awaiting the arrival of victory. Yet, he knowingly defied the central government's decision to resist and insisted on organizing a puppet government to implement the policies of the enemy invaders; knowingly defied the leadership of our country and insisted on currying favor with the enemy chieftains to seek his own personal gain; knowingly defied the national flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun and insisted on changing it to the Five-Colored Flag to antagonize; knowingly defied the people's patriotic and impassioned spirit and insisted on subjecting them to the enemy puppets to make them obedient subjects.

The puppet organization was named "government" and divided into departments, resembling the central government, and saying that it was an expanded maintenance committee is inappropriate. As for the establishment of the Pacification Army, although it was said to maintain public order, it was actually at the disposal of the enemy. As for the establishment of the Opium Prohibition Bureau, although it was said to curb the Japanese operation of opium, it was actually using public office to profit from selling it. As for the issuance of Huaxing Bank banknotes, although it was said not to affect the people, it was actually intentionally disrupting finance. Even if the amount of issuance was not as large as that of the puppet Central Reserve Bank notes, it was only a matter of fifty steps compared to a hundred steps. As for his rampant extortion, although it was said that it was only enough to maintain the expenses of the puppet organization, it was actually providing ample financial resources for the enemy puppets. Furthermore, he did not deny the seizure of customs, nor could it be said that there was no factual basis. Moreover, his

successive declarations contained statements such as "Scorched earth policy is tantamount to suicide; accommodating communism is like summoning bandits; it is the worst government in history" and "The party government that has only accumulated mistakes and harmed the country has lost the people's faith and is on the verge of collapse." Documents such as the declaration of the puppet Reformed Government and the speech on the anniversary of the fall of Nanjing can prove it. Therefore, his slander of the central government and destruction of the nation's system were carried out to the extreme, and how could he claim that it was of a servient nature? Such acts of instigating rebellion, betraying the country for personal glory, hating the party and the nation, and recognizing the enemy as one's father, yet still claiming that he had no intention of colluding with the enemy and plotting to resist his own country, then would not the stone statues of Qin Hui and Zhang Bangchang, who have been cursed for thousands of years, be greatly wronged? If asked of the defendant, he would probably find it difficult to explain himself."

### Reasons for Upholding the Original Verdict

As for the reasons for not reducing the sentence and still upholding the original death sentence, it was stated: "Article 3 of the Regulations on Handling Traitor Cases stipulates that if a traitor mentioned in the preceding article has evidence of assisting in the war effort or benefiting the people, his sentence may be reduced. Since the legal text clearly stipulates 'may be reduced,' the judge has the discretion to consider whether or not to reduce it. If, after considering the case, there is assistance in the war effort or acts that benefit the people, but compared to other treacherous acts, the merits and demerits are not enough to offset each other, then not reducing the sentence is not illegal. Therefore, it is truly insufficient to impose anything other than the death penalty on the defendant in this case to serve as a stern warning and to manifest the law of the nation."

### Zhang Sumin's Trial Continued Yesterday; Chen Jinsheng's Sentencing on the 16th

Zhang Sumin, the former Director of the Customs Department of the puppet Ministry of Finance and Director of the Enemy Property Management Office of the puppet Ministry of Finance, was retried by the High Court yesterday. Zhang repeatedly claimed that his participation in the puppet organization was solely to protect the customs system and safeguard British and American property, and requested the court to summon Shen Siliang to testify. The court then adjourned the hearing to a later date.

[Another Report] The High Court concluded the trial of Chen Jinsheng, a staff member of the Judicial Section of the puppet Police Bureau, yesterday, and the sentencing is scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 16th.

### Collection of Clothing Fees for the Defense Corps Has Been Stopped; Application for Exemption of Business Tax on Books Has Been Submitted to the Ministry for Instructions; Director Gu Reported to the Senate Yesterday

The Finance Committee of the Municipal Senate held its fourth meeting at 12:00 noon yesterday. Eight senators attended, with Chairman Wang Yansong presiding. Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, attended and reported on the following: (1) The collection of clothing fees for the Defense Corps has been stopped. (2) The application for exemption of business tax on books has been submitted to the ministry for instructions, but a reply has not yet been received.

(4) Two cases of corruption have been discovered after strict enforcement of the rectification of discipline, and they have been punished according to the law. (5) The entertainment tax is temporarily collected at 40%. A decision will be made after discussion and resolution at the second general meeting. Subsequently, eight proposals were discussed, including a resolution that municipal construction donations should be collected from both institutions and schools during the autumn and winter seasons. Regarding small inns with cubicle-style rooms, it was resolved that the hotel tax should be waived, and a letter was sent to the municipal government for consideration. Regarding the request from the local cloth industry association for permanent exemption from local cloth business tax, it was resolved to forward it to the Finance Bureau for review.

### Cars of Traitors Zhou Fohai and Others; Disposal Bureau Sells in Advance

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau received 58 various vehicles transferred by the Military Statistics Bureau as property of traitors and discovered by the bureau itself. Except for those that were damaged beyond repair, most of them were kept by the Military Statistics Bureau, the Garrison Headquarters, the Youth League, and other agencies. The Disposal Bureau, fearing that with the increasing number of imported vehicles, long-term entrusted custody would not be a good solution, decided to sell them in advance, with the original users having priority in purchasing them, and the Disposal Bureau keeping the cash. The original owners of the above vehicles were traitors Zhou Fohai, Luo Junqiang, Qian Daqi, Su Chengde, Ding Mocun, Pan Sansheng, Sheng Youyi, Dai Airu, and others.

### Lawsuit Regarding Jockey Club Bonds; Court to Announce Verdict Tomorrow Morning; Plaintiff Demands Repayment at Two Thousand Times the Principal

[Reported by This Newspaper] Regarding the case of four holders of Jockey Club corporate bonds, including Dibos and Solomon, demanding that the legal representative of the Jockey Club repay the principal at two thousand times the original amount, the court is scheduled to announce the verdict tomorrow morning. A reporter visited Gui Zhongshu, the plaintiff's lawyer, yesterday, who said that his legal basis was Article 12 of the "Regulations on Supplementing Civil Procedure after Restoration": "If, after the establishment of a legal act, the situation changes due to reasons not attributable to the parties, which could not have been foreseen at the time, and the original effect is obviously unfair, the court shall make a fair judgment to increase or decrease the payment or change other original effects."

The Jockey Club corporate bonds were issued in 1934 because the Jockey Club owed HSBC more than 2 million yuan, which was due, and the Jockey Club was unable to repay it, so it issued 3 million yuan in corporate bonds, with real estate as collateral and an interest rate of 6%.

Lawyer Gui suggested three ways to increase the repayment standard: one, based on the price of silver; two, based on the price of real estate; and three, based on the cost of living index.

Gui Zhongshu told the reporter that corporate bonds are different from government bonds because national sovereignty is not bound by law. Moreover, government bonds are borne by the government, that is, by the people of the whole country. The country suffered huge losses during the eight years of war, and repaying government bonds at a one-to-one ratio is to reduce the burden on the entire population. Corporate bonds are also different from bank deposits because corporate bonds are borne by the debtor, while bank deposits are private property entrusted to the bank for safekeeping.

### Accusation of Electricity Theft Affecting Business; Claiming Damages of Over 10 Million

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Civil Court yesterday heard a lawsuit regarding the theft of electricity affecting business income. The plaintiff, Zhou Guisun, is the owner of the Xin Xin Printing Company at 64 Guling Road, specializing in printing various small newspapers. In May of this year, when the electric meter was damaged, he noticed that some of the lights in the Lianhe Printing Company to his left were also not lit, which aroused suspicion. During the repair of the electric meter, it was discovered that a wire from Lianhe Printing Company was privately connected to Zhou's electric meter. Zhou Guisun stated that from January 1944 before the victory to December 1945, there was an electricity shortage in the city, and the power company had very strict restrictions on the amount of electricity used by customers. Electricity is the power source for printing presses, and stealing electricity directly affected his business. In August, he filed a criminal self-accusation with the court, along with a civil lawsuit, accusing Chen Yanling, the manager of Lianhe Printing Company. In the criminal part, the defendant Chen Yanling was sentenced to a fine, and the civil part was transferred to the immigration court. During the hearing yesterday, the plaintiff's attorney, Xu Jianjie, based on the electricity bills of the Xin Xin Printing Company for the months of March, April, and May of this year, totaling 422 degrees (during the period when electricity was being stolen), compared with the electricity bills for the months of June, July, and August after the theft was discovered, totaling 272 degrees, concluded that the amount of electricity stolen from Xin Xin was approximately one-third of the total electricity usage, and demanded compensation for one-third of the total income of Xin Xin from January 1944 to December 1945, totaling 16.6 million yuan, as compensation for business losses during the period of electricity theft. The court stated that the case of business losses caused by the theft of electricity was unprecedented, and since the defendant did not appear in court, the hearing was adjourned to a later date.

### Reader Consultation: Legal Questions

(1) Renting Land to Build a House

Fang Yu asked: I have a plot of land that was rented to a Mr. Sun in May 1922 by my mother. Three one-story houses were built, with a ten-year lease. After the lease expired, the house would be appraised by a notary, and the landlord would buy it back at half the appraised price. At that time, the rent was very low, only two yuan and fifty cents per month. Unexpectedly, the lessee passed away before the lease expired. When the lease expired in 1932, I repeatedly urged the lessee's heirs to fulfill the contract, but they repeatedly made excuses, saying that they were widows and orphans, and asked for a delay. I was compassionate at the time and delayed the matter until now, fourteen years overdue. The other party is still delaying. I would like to ask: (1) Is this matter time-barred? (2) Can I ask the court to mediate and recover the losses for the past fourteen years? (3) If mediation fails, can I sue to recover the land without compensation?

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai's Answer] (1) After the lease expired, you repeatedly urged the other party to return the land and collected rent. If it is in the nature of compensation for damages, it cannot be regarded as an indefinite lease. (2) You can apply to the court for mediation. To recover losses, you must have solid evidence. (3) If mediation fails, you can file a lawsuit. As for acquiring the buildings on the land without compensation, it is not in accordance with the original agreement.

(2) Terminating a Child Bride Engagement

Wang Meijuan asked: I am an ignorant and weak woman. I lost my mother at a young age. When I was seven years old, my father came to Shanghai to do business and chose a Mr. Someone as my betrothed to be his child bride. My mother-in-law often humiliates me, and my fiancé is idle and has participated in a puppet organization and behaves improperly. I really don't want to marry such a person, so I came to Shanghai last year to work in a yarn factory. Now I want to terminate the engagement made in the past. I would like to ask: (1) Is the engagement made by my father in the past valid? (2) Does it still take effect if I did not agree to the engagement at the time?

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai's Answer] (1) The marriage certificate is fundamentally invalid. (2) Since the engagement was made by someone other than the person involved, it is not legally effective.

### Third Phase Second Half-Month Joint Cotton Yarn Allocation: Continuous Allocation to Commence Tomorrow; First Installment Totals Six Thousand and Two Pieces

[Report from Our Newspaper] The total amount of cotton yarn for joint allocation in this city during the third phase is 24,009 pieces. The allocation for the first half of the month was 12,004.5 pieces. Since the commencement of distribution on the 26th of last month, it will be completed today. Tomorrow (the 11th), the second half of the third phase, consisting of 12,004.5 pieces, will commence allocation. In terms of procedures, there will not be significant changes compared to before. The allocated prices for each yarn will remain the same as the negotiated prices for the first half-month period. The only change is that the two periods for allocating yarn in the second half of the month will each be extended to ten days, an increase of three days per period compared to the first half of the month.

It is reported that various Reproduction Product Associations, due to the large number of their members, were unable to submit application forms before the yarn allocation in the first half of the month, and have requested to join the application in the second half of the month. The Textile Control Committee (紡管會) stated that as the first yarn allocation for the second half of the month is scheduled to begin tomorrow, this request could not be considered at this time. Furthermore, according to reports from Reproduction Product Associations, the yarn counts and types previously allocated were not entirely suitable, and they requested improvements. In response, the Textile Control Committee has instructed the various Reproduction Product Associations to prepare two types of statistical data: (1) detailed information on each member of the association, including their actual yarn requirements; (2) the counts and types of cotton yarn required by each association. The deadline for submitting the above information to the Textile Control Committee is the 15th, to facilitate possible adjustments during the second yarn allocation in the second half of the month.

Spinning Construction (紡建) Yarn Types for Allocation

Furthermore, the total amount for the first yarn allocation in the second half of the month is 24,009 and a quarter pieces, which is 6,002 and a quarter pieces. Based on the allocation ratio of one-third for Spinning Construction and two-thirds for privately-owned factories, Spinning Construction should allocate 2,001 pieces, and privately-owned factories should allocate 6,001 and a quarter pieces. To meet the demands of the various Reproduction Product Associations, Spinning Construction will increase its allocation by 100 bundles this period, totaling 2,101 pieces, and will also increase the varieties of fine yarn. The counts, brands, types, number of pieces, and unit prices of the yarns to be allocated by Spinning Construction this period are listed below:

Count Brand/Type Pieces Unit Price

20 count Rainbow Ball Cone Yarn 200 1.75 million

20 count Li Ma Cone Yarn 200 1.75 million

32 count Blue Phoenix Large Package 200 2.32 million

32 count Yang He Baled Package 100 2.32 million

32 count Year Large Package 30 2.61 million

Double Strand

32 count Immortal Peach Cone Thread 30 2.61 million

Double Strand

40 count Blue Phoenix Large Package 50 2.77 million

40 count Shi Guang Baled Package 100 2.77 million

42 count Water Moon Large Package 350 2.79 million

Double Strand

42 count Li Ma Cone Thread 120 2.79 million

Double Strand

60 count Sun Light Large Package 10 5.15 million

60 count Sun Light Cone Yarn 10 5.15 million

60 count Unbranded Cone Yarn 10 5.55 million

Double Strand

80 count Unbranded Cone Yarn 10 6.00 million

Double Strand

80 count Rainbow Ball Burned Baled Package 5 6.00 million

Double Strand

The above yarns total 1,465 pieces, equivalent to 2,101 pieces of 20-count yarn. The total value is 3.6323 billion yuan.

Increased Cotton Yarn Usage

Mr. Pan Shihao, the person in charge of the Reproduction and Allocation Association, reported everything in the afternoon at the Reproduction and Allocation Association, inviting representatives from the Ye Dyeing and Weaving, Knitting, Underwear, Towel and Blanket, Handkerchief, and Handmade Cotton Weaving industries. Regarding the assessment of factories that have declared and received allocations and the investigation of factories that have supplemented their declarations, a resolution was made to expedite the process, ensuring that the number of requests for allocation would not be overreported and that factories that have received allocations would avoid irregularities. According to Mr. Pan, the original declared yarn usage by various industries was 40,013 pieces per month. As designated by the Textile Control Committee, the allocation was divided into four installments at a 60% rate. Supplemental declarations require a total of 14,000 pieces, and adjustments to the declared yarn usage by factories that have already submitted supplements also show an increase. This must be added to the calculation, so the additional allocation will be more than one-third of the original allocation amount. Various industries are strictly setting standards and re-examining the data. It is expected that some factories will have their allocations reduced, but the allocation at a 60% rate is indeed insufficient for the vast majority of factories. The Handkerchief and Towel and Blanket industries originally declared their registrations based on a 60% calculation, but this was not clearly stated, and the Textile Control Committee further reduced it by 60%, resulting in even greater yarn shortages for most factories. Mr. Pan clearly informed the authorities of the reasons for this, but due to the procedural requirements, it could not be corrected immediately. During the last yarn allocation, various industries returned over 300 orders. This time, even more orders were returned. The reasons for this include the unsuitability of counts and types, the sluggish business of the replication industry, and the high interest rates. Larger factories are deemed insufficient due to the 60% allocation, which can be described as uneven distribution of hardship and joy. The Textile Control Committee believes that there is a solution to the count issue. Deputy Director Li will invite yarn mill owner Wang Qiyu and replication industry representative Pan Shihao to discuss the matter.

Few Transactions in the Yarn Market

Yesterday, the yarn market was still restricted by price limits, with few transactions, forming a silent market. Guest traders were unable to find purchases, and some secretly added handling fees outside the price limits, with tacit understanding. It is said that the secret prices were quite firm, such as 20-count Special Double Horse at 2.25 million, Special Golden City at 2.2 million, and Red Kui Xing at 2 million. 10-count Gold Real Star at 1.65 million. All were exceeding the officially fixed price. 42-count Blue Phoenix was trading at 2.35 million, 32-count Blue Phoenix at 2.78 million, 20-count Blue Phoenix at 2 million, and 32-count Silver Moon at 2.43 million, which were generally slightly lower than yesterday.

### Steady Gold Prices

Yesterday, due to the intensified atmosphere of peace talks, buyers' interest was weaker, but due to the weekend and the closure of customs, the lower prices easily rebounded. Shengkai opened at around 2.39 million, and after opening, the Central Bank gradually lowered the price from 2.395 million. Members of securities firms sold gold to exchange for stocks, further increasing selling pressure, causing the price to drop to 2.362 million. After ten o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 100 taels at a price of 2.365 million. After the low, the market turned around, gradually showing a steady state near noon, struggling to rise to around 2.375 million. After noon, buyers again speculated on stocks under various conjectures, and asking prices jumped to above 2.4 million. As a result, the closing price rose by more than 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Gold ornaments and silver ingots remained unchanged, and silver dollars rose slightly. The unofficial money market was stable, with interest rates remaining at around 15%.

### US Dollar Rises Unofficially

The foreign currency situation was slightly more stable, with the unofficial US dollar rate at around 4,130 to 4,180 yuan, slightly better than the previous day. In the afternoon, it continued to rise to above 4,200 yuan. After four o'clock, there was a sudden report of a price of 4,500 yuan, but this price was not widespread due to the early close of the market on Saturday. Hong Kong notes were initially stable but then weakened, purely because the telegraphic transfer rate did not rise. As a result, the closing price fell by 10 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers retreated to 862 yuan and 865 yuan, all supplied and sold by Guangdong traders. Indian remittance was 1,045 yuan, and British remittance was 14,000 yuan, with few buyers. The official exchange rate for the US dollar was unchanged.

### Situation Gradually Clarifies; Stock Market Morale Boosted; Chinese Stocks Rebound Across the Board Yesterday

Chinese stocks fluctuated greatly yesterday. At the opening, due to the news of the ceasefire, morale improved and all stocks rose. After the opening, outside buyers successively entered the market, and buying interest within the market was extremely strong, continuing to rise. At high prices, the market gradually showed a rotation, and 176 and 198 were sold, gradually falling. In the middle, there was a major struggle, rising and falling repeatedly, extremely volatile. However, as short positions were fully covered and sellers continued to appear, it gradually became a situation of few buyers with constant supply. The mid-term rise in the situation turned weary, causing great anxiety among long positions. After 11:30, there was a sudden cut in long positions, once breaking below the 600 yuan level. But after this, short positions only covered, and buying interest in 151 increased again. Time was pressing, and a certain broker rushed in after selling, with 154 and 151 mutually covering urgently. Each stock gradually rose to a high price within a few minutes of closing, ending the session. As a result, compared to the previous closing, popular stocks such as Yong Yarn and New Light rose by 50%, Xinhe, Jingfu, and Qinxing each rose by 70%, and Meiya alone rose by 100%. Cold stocks such as Jinglun, Xinya, and Lianan remained flat, while the rest showed slight gains of up to 50%. The total trading volume was 9.52 million shares. Outside the market, each stock rose slightly.

Foreign stocks were slightly stable yesterday, with each stock maintained by someone at a low price, and slightly rebounded. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Jiayi Yarn, Hui De, Yechu, Shipping, and Steel slightly rose, while the rest each rose by 50%.

### Black Market for Rayon Rises Again; 120 Semi-Dull Most Popular

The rayon market was booming again yesterday, especially 120 semi-dull, which was the most popular. Due to the scarcity of goods on the market, the price rose by 100,000 yuan yesterday. 120 bright also rose by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. New Tianqiao goods were offered at 350,000 yuan. 150 bright and semi-dull both rose by 50,000 yuan. Only 75 semi-dull had sluggish sales, maintaining the original price from the previous day. Transactions between factories were very few. Ordinary substandard goods of 712 points were transacted by peers at 3.35 million yuan. Actual selling manufacturers did not adopt it, making it unable to increase prices. Silk goods and bedding slightly prospered yesterday. Exclusive Sheng goods saw a decline of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, due to the abundance of spot goods on the market, with some seeking to sell cheaply for cash.

### Guangzhou Yarn Prices Soar; Chen Kecheng Arrives in Shanghai to Appeal

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th] Since the restriction on the transportation of cotton yarn to the south, the price of yarn in Guangzhou has suddenly soared. Each bale of 20-count cotton yarn requires 3 million yuan. Due to excessively high export costs, sales are impossible, resulting in over 80% of the 900+ weaving factories being forced to shut down. Unemployment has reached tens of thousands, forming a major industrial and social crisis. Chen Kecheng, Chairman of the Weaving and Dyeing Industry Production Cooperative, flew to Shanghai on the 8th specifically for this reason to appeal to the competent authorities and relevant institutions, requesting transportation to Guangdong to aid sales.

### Yarn Factories Purchase Cotton; Four Banks Can Provide Funds

The new cotton crop has already entered the market, and various yarn factories and yarn merchants are purchasing it separately. The Four Banks General Office has formulated cotton pledge remittance measures to provide cotton purchase funds to the various manufacturers. National Banks have already complied with the order to implement it. It is understood that yarn factories purchasing cotton from production areas can not only use it for pledge remittance to the cotton-using areas, but can also convert it into collateral loans. However, cotton that has already been purchased and stored by the factories is not allowed to be used for collateral loans. Cotton purchased by cotton merchants is limited to pledge remittance and cannot be converted into collateral loans.

### Joint Commercial Centers Must Pledge to the Social Affairs Bureau Not to Sell Smuggled or Tax-Evading Goods

Recently, commercial centers have sprung up in this city, and their scale is quite large. Most of them deal in foreign goods, including daily necessities, consumables, luxury goods, and pharmaceuticals. Whether their sources are entirely imported goods permitted by customs after paying taxes is highly questionable. It is now known that the municipal authorities have specifically stipulated management measures. Any joint commercial center must register in accordance with the law and pay taxes as required. The organizers of the commercial center must all pledge to the Social Affairs Bureau, guaranteeing that the goods sold within the commercial center are free from smuggling or tax evasion, and are responsible for guaranteeing the payment of various taxes. If there is any violation, they will be severely punished or ordered to cease operations.

### Japanese White Paper Resold Via the United States

It is understood that recently, white paper shipments have arrived in large quantities, so the market price has fallen again. The American merchant, Hai Ning Foreign Firm, recently shipped a large batch of white paper from the United States. According to the batch of white paper, the United States first purchased it from Japan and then transshipped it to our country. The paper did not actually travel through America. Japan has recently launched large-scale production of the paper industry. Transparent paper produced in the past by Japan was famous in countries around the world, exceeding even Germany.

### Rice Prices Firm, Oil Prices Fall; Overseas Flour in Rumor

The rice market saw a strong influx of sources, with more than 14,000 stones in the North and South markets combined. The South market was firm in the morning and slack in the afternoon, while the North market was sluggish in the morning and tight in the afternoon. As a result, both japonica and indica rice remained unchanged. White Yuan and Yin Yuan also did not rise or fall. The consumption of flour slackened, returning by 100 to 200 yuan. There are rumors of a transaction for Canadian foreign flour, pending confirmation by a foreign telegram. Wheat bran was very slow, with no changes in price. The arrival and consumption of wheat were both scarce, with only small flour mills slightly entering the market. The market trend was flat. After a sharp drop in the transportation of soybeans to Japan, the selling price firmed up, rebounding by 1,000 yuan. Although red sorghum followed arrival and consumption, there were no ups and downs. The arrival of sesame was scarce, and digestion was still active, continuing to increase by 1,000 yuan. After the fall in raw peanuts, shops took advantage of the opportunity to purchase, stopping the decline and turning to increase, with prices rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Peanuts also increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybean cake was inactive in other ports, and digestion was sluggish. The market was tired and lacked vigor. The oil market rebounded slightly, with all oils continuing to fall by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.

### Flat-Priced Flour Supply Exceeds Demand; Merchant Capital Difficulties

Since the price fluctuations of flour and the shutdown of flour mills last month, the flour flat-price distribution office has been reorganized on the first of this month. The distribution work is now handled by the Flour and Bran Commercial Association. The quantity sold has also increased to 12,000 bags, and the price per bag has been increased to 20,500 yuan. The official price is almost the same as the black market price. Since the start of sales, supply has exceeded demand, with daily balances reaching one-third, causing general flour merchants to be unable to advance funds and feel quite difficult. According to reports from our reporter, the procedure for distributing flour at this office is that 12,000 bags of flour are allocated daily by five factories, and then transferred by the association to various flour merchants for distribution. The price is prepaid by the merchants. Recently, the official price has been raised, and many actual users are waiting and watching, causing the flour merchants to be unable to circulate funds. At the same time, the profit for the merchants distributing the allocated flour is 100 yuan per bag, the association's handling fee is 100 yuan, the tax rate is 300 yuan, the shipping fee is 300 yuan, and the factory price is 19,700 yuan. Adding the above figures together, it is said that the merchants have recently requested various parties to improve the distribution methods.

### Coal and White Coal Diverge; Coal Owners Raise Prices; White Coal (Hongji) Arrives

Although the quantity of coal for allocation has been approved by the association, there are currently 1,028 members in the association, with each member actually allocated 11 tons. The remaining 4,000+ tons will be allocated to shareholders of the joint venture. Members who hold one share of the joint venture will be allocated an additional 1.5 tons. If the process is handled quickly, distribution can begin in the middle of next week. However, the application procedures are extremely troublesome and cannot be resold on the black market. Therefore, members who currently hold goods are raising prices and closing in, and the market is moving towards a peak. A large amount of white coal (Hongji lump coal) has recently been shipped from Hong Kong, and the quality is better than the last time. Therefore, the market price of Yangquan white coal has also returned to 1 million yuan from 1.1 million yuan. However, Hongji coal fines are in short supply, and prices have risen again.

### Anle Rayon Factory Still in Preparation; Technicians Hired, but No Definite Date for Commencement

[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, there were rumors that Anle Rayon would resume production this year. Our reporter specifically visited the person in charge of Anle Textile Company to inquire about the details. The reply was that production will resume within the next year. Because ordering machine parts from the United States requires eight months for ordering and delivery, and four months for transportation. If ordered from the United Kingdom, it will take 18 months. Therefore, the period required to resume production cannot be less than one year. The rumor that production could resume this year is inaccurate. As for hiring foreign technicians to come to China, it is also a difficult task. The factory's machines were originally purchased from France, but French engineers are unwilling to be hired, and the same is true in the United States, because there is a great need for this talent in their own countries. Finally, based on emotional connections, three British technicians were invited from the largest Cortauld Rayon factory in the United Kingdom, and they have now arrived in Shanghai to begin their service. After the factory starts production, it can produce 17 boxes of rayon per day. Anle Rayon Factory was established before the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1937, with a capital of 6 million national currency, and the scale was grand. At that time, a certain giant in the financial world was also preparing a rayon factory with a capital of 5 million yuan. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Anle Factory continued to build the factory site, while the latter announced its termination and returned the shares. Therefore, today, after the total victory of the War of Resistance, Anle is the only rayon factory in our country. Because establishing this factory requires too much capital and technical assistance is also required from foreigners, as of today, people in the silk industry have no intention of investing.

### Ge Jingzhong Suggests Ways to Save the Silk Industry Crisis: First Improve Quality, Second Reduce Costs

Although the Chinese silk industry has been supported by the government in recent years and the China Silk Company has actively guided it, it has not yet broken the deadlock, and the crisis is becoming more serious. In order to save this crisis, the China Silk Company specifically invited representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the silk reeling association, and the silkworm breeding industry to gather in Shanghai to discuss countermeasures. The meeting began on the 8th, and because the problems are too many and very complex, the meeting is still continuing and is unlikely to end in the coming days. It is understood that this meeting will determine the principles, and the specific methods for saving the crisis must be the responsibility of representatives from all parties to conduct further research. According to General Manager Ge Jingzhong of the China Silk Company, the Chinese silk industry is facing a serious crisis. Under the current circumstances, the only way is to seek self-rescue. Relying on government assistance is not the right approach. There are two ways to save ourselves: first, improve quality, and second, reduce costs. The above two items are the highest principles of this meeting, and they are also the key to saving the silk industry crisis today.

### Mayor Wu Convened a Meeting to Seek to Expand Soybean Cake Sales

The various oil pressing factories in this city believe that the sales of soybean cake have been sluggish recently, and they can only maintain costs by relying on the actual sales of soybean oil. Therefore, the production of soybean oil is scarce. Mayor Wu believes that in order to stabilize soybean oil prices, production should be increased first. In order to make oil factories increase production, it is necessary to promote soybean cake sales. For this issue, Mayor Wu sought to thoroughly resolve the problem and convened a meeting of relevant parties at the Municipal Government at 2:30 p.m. yesterday. Those present included Dao Zhongtao, General Manager of the Municipal Bank, He Molin, Manager of the Promotion Department of the China Trust Bureau, Xu Hengshou, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Taiwan Trade Bureau, Song Yixin, Assistant Manager of the Taiwan Sugar Company, and Li Zuye, Representative of the Oil Pressing Industry Association. First, Mayor Wu expressed his views, proposing to promote the sale of soybean cake to Taiwan or to rural areas throughout the country by the China Trust Bureau to increase agricultural fertilizer or as a raw material for raising livestock. The principles were agreed upon, but Song Yixin of the Taiwan Sugar Company stated that the market price of soybean cake is about 500,000 yuan per ton. Although the company is trying to obtain chemical fertilizer subsidies from the Executive Yuan, even though the price is 600,000 yuan per ton, its fertilization effect exceeds soybean cake by more than 200 million, which is considered too uneconomical. As for how the Taiwan Trade Bureau and the China Trust Bureau will purchase soybean cake, the methods will be determined separately. The oil factory representatives' proposal to apply for a 500 million yuan loan was also discussed at the time.

### Central Bank Launches Export Commodity Loans

In order to relieve the export industry, the Central Bank has launched export commodity loans. For exporters who intend to purchase, manufacture, and transport goods overseas, the bank will provide loans. After the purchase is completed, when the goods are transported from the place of production to the port, another loan can be made, handling pledge remittance to form a unified entity. That is, the loans for the export industry are divided into two stages. The first stage is domestic loans, which are from the place of production to Shanghai. The second stage is foreign loans, which are from Shanghai to foreign markets. The loan amounts will depend on the needs of the exporters, and the detailed methods have been drafted and submitted for approval.

### Rice Export Restrictions Extended for One Month

Previously, due to the lack of rice in this city, the authorities specifically stipulated restrictions on rice export. The regulations stated that for rice exports, it is necessary to submit invoices from rice merchants in the rice production area, certificates from trade associations, and two or more documents such as customs declarations and waybills. A certificate issued by the Ministry of Food is also required. Only after the customs verifies the documents can the goods be released. The original deadline for these restrictions on export was the end of last month. Recently, according to the customs announcement, it has been ordered by the Executive Yuan that the implementation period of this measure be extended by one month.

### Government Bonds Gradually Rise

The government bond market continued to be stable. Unified C opened at around 1,350 yuan, and Chen De as well as retail investors had buying interest. From below 1,340 yuan, it gradually rose to a weak 1,500 yuan. At noon, it hovered between 1,450 yuan and 1,480 yuan. As a result, the closing price rose by 140 yuan compared to the previous day. A, B, and D each rose by 20 yuan, and Unified E also rose by 60 yuan. The turnover was about 5 million yuan.

### Northern Traders Search for Goods; Cotton Cloth Rises Across the Board

Due to the large-scale search for goods by northern traders, low-grade cotton cloth prospered. The high-grade goods allocated by Spinning Construction were also raised by 1,000 yuan, and other cloths rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The market price for spot goods was 83,000 yuan, while the goods delivered by Spinning Construction were 81,000 yuan. The price of colored cloth also increased due to rising transportation costs for fuel and dyes. Mainland Shilin opened at 125,000 yuan.

### Seafood Sales Sluggish

The source of seafood is uninterrupted, but the market is tired and lacks vigor. Shrimp tails, fungus, seaweed, salted and light vegetables, and prayer vegetables have fallen continuously. Dried scallops and squid are rapidly trending downwards, falling drastically by 30% in three or four days. Sea cucumbers are stable in name but loose in reality. Overseas vegetables and seaweed are declining, and no one is asking about them. New mushrooms are arriving in large quantities, and sales are scarce, making it difficult to gain a foothold. Fish fins, fish skin, and tapioca are stable with a hint of fatigue. Only fish maw is in short supply, making it stable and attractive. As for the rest of the goods, due to people's fear, it is difficult to improve in a short time.

### Africa Needs Chinese Tea

As for the Yangzhuang tea market, although various export firms continue to consider handling premium Zhenmei tea and other varieties, they are unwilling to inquire because the new goods are too expensive. The quality of old tea is poor and does not suit tastes, so the market remains deserted. According to insiders, Chinese tea is currently in great demand overseas, especially in Morocco, Africa. It is said that a certain tea company in this city will soon receive a remittance of a large amount of francs from there, instructing them to pack as much cheap and good-quality tea as possible. However, looking ahead, with the rising production costs of Chinese tea, exports may not be optimistic for a while.

### Madame Chiang Kai-shek and Mrs. Marshall Visit Municipal Experimental People's School, Inquiring in Detail in Each Classroom

On the afternoon of the ninth, at three o'clock, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Mrs. Marshall, and Ms. Chang Ai-chen visited the Municipal Experimental People's School on Jiaozhou Road. They were warmly received by Ms. Yu Qingchang, the school principal, who reported on the school's overview. They then accompanied them to visit the clinic, home economics room, nursery, and other facilities, and inspected the teaching situation in each classroom. Madame Chiang Kai-shek and others inquired in detail in each classroom with a kind and approachable demeanor. For example, in the first classroom, she asked a student why they were studying at the school. In the third classroom, she asked a student what their family did for a living. In a classroom where they were learning bookkeeping, Madame Chiang Kai-shek immediately gave a question, asking them to calculate three years' interest. In a classroom where they were learning English, Mrs. Marshall immediately wrote the three English words "cat," "dog," and "rat" on the blackboard, and Madame Chiang Kai-shek asked the students what they meant. The students answered one by one, responding quickly. They then went to the auditorium on the third floor to attend a welcome meeting for the school's students. Principal Yu first introduced them one by one, saying that Madame Chiang Kai-shek was a leader of Chinese women and a world-renowned figure who had spoken in the US Congress, earning continuous applause. It was a great honor for Madame Chiang Kai-shek to visit today. Mrs. Marshall had traveled for peace in China and accompanied General Marshall to Lushan eight or nine times during the summer. Chang Ai-chen was the executive director of the New Life Movement Women's Guidance Committee, a leader in the women's community. After the introductions, Madame Chiang Kai-shek and others gave speeches in succession:

Madame Chiang Kai-shek's Speech

She said briefly: I am very happy to see you all today. I often think of you because you are the backbone of the future nation. Your future and success are the future and success of the country. I just asked a child why they came to school, and the child replied: To eat. To eat is right, because in today's world, to eat, one must have knowledge and study. However, we should not only have food to eat ourselves, but also ensure that others have food to eat. I also asked a child what service is, and one student said, "Working hard," which is not right. Another student said, "Service is helping each other," which is correct. We should study today with the purpose of serving the country and society. The teachers in your school have very low salaries, but their spirit of service is very good. You should understand the teachers' hard work and study harder.

Mrs. Marshall's Speech

She said briefly: I am very happy to see so many young people studying here. Many young people in the United States love China, because their fathers and brothers have either come to China or are still in China, and have witnessed the unity and heroic resistance of Chinese youth during the eight years, which they admire very much. If the young people in the United States knew that I came here to visit today, they would surely ask me to bring a message, expressing their concern and friendship to you. What you learn in your minds here cannot be taken away by anyone and is truly your own. You should respect and learn from your teachers, and then your lives can be richer and more enjoyable.

Chang Ai-chen's Speech

She said briefly: Principal Yu is an old friend of mine for decades. Principal Yu took the position of Director of the Social Education Department not to become an official, but to promote work. Studying here is a rare opportunity. You should seize this opportunity and study hard. Finally, students from the nursery, women's group, and youth group performed entertainment programs, including "Little Rabbit," "Selling Vegetables Song," "Little Music Team," etc. At about five o'clock, Madame Chiang Kai-shek and others smiled, nodded, and said goodbye amidst the cheers of the students.

Li Ximou chaired the lecture, and Chen Xuanhsan translated. The main points of Ms. Vawter's lecture are summarized as follows: (1) Most of the teachers in San Francisco's national schools are women. (2) Teachers are required to be college graduates, pass examinations, and become formal teachers after a three-year probationary period. (3) After the war, teachers' salaries ranged from 150 to 250 yuan. (4) Compulsory education is provided for children aged four and a half to eighteen in each class. (5) The city's education bureau receives funding from the state government, averaging 60 yuan per child. (7) Textbooks are provided by the state government, and reference books and stationery are provided by the city government. (8) The curriculum for each grade is compiled by teachers, and children in each grade are taught in three groups: excellent, average, and poor. (9) Special children, such as those with limps or trachoma, are taught in separate classes. (10) Special attention is paid to training children in cleanliness and good habits. (11) Corporal punishment is not used. For children who violate the rules, teachers and parents deal with them together. (12) Schools emphasize music education. (13) Most school buildings meet standards, and facilities for lighting, ventilation, and exercise are very complete. (14) Teaching in various subjects emphasizes observation and field trips. Each classroom is equipped with a wireless radio. (15) Finally, she hoped that every country and every child could understand each other.

### Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, Chen Shizhen, Arrives in Nanjing

Requesting the Ministry of Education to Allocate Funds for National Middle Schools

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Chen Shizhen, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, arrived in Nanjing on the afternoon of the 8th to discuss matters with the Ministry of Education.

It is heard that the Ministry of Education has expressed its agreement. It is also learned that after the Xuzhou Normal School of the Guidance Committee is taken over by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, it can be moved to northern Jiangsu, because Xuzhou cannot have three normal schools.

Hawks Pott, who is the first person in Christian education.

F.L. Hawks Pott's Speech

Then Dr. Pott gave a speech, saying briefly: This return from the United States is like a dream of Huangliang, but I feel that everything has changed. Although I have been in China for 60 years, I have only stayed in the United States for five years in between. However, in these five years, China has changed endlessly. After returning to China, I have many feelings, and I can't say them all at once. Now I would like to tell you three points, because these three points have been repeatedly asked by countless friends and relatives: (1) What did you do in the United States for five years? Answer: Waiting, waiting, waiting to return to China. In the process of waiting, I also promoted and raised funds for St. John's, and read Chinese every day to prepare for future use. (2) What is the American impression of China? Answer: Americans admire China's ability to embark on the road to prosperity and the realization of democratic politics, but they express disappointment with the current state of domestic division. However, they believe that the civil war will end soon and that China still has a brilliant future. (3) How long will you stay in China this time? Answer: We (Dr. Pott and his wife refer to themselves) will live in Shanghai for as long as we live.

Yan Huiqing's Speech

### A-League Soccer League; Qingbai Team Off to a Winning Start; 4-0 Victory Over Soviet Union Team Yesterday

In the A-League soccer league, the defending champion Qingbai made its first appearance yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, fighting the Soviet Union at Yiyuan Stadium. More than 5,000 spectators were present and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. Before the game, the Soviet Union's Karolyevich presented flowers, and Qingbai's Captain Xu received them on behalf of the team. As a result of the battle, Qingbai won a crushing victory with a score of 4-0.

First Half Qingbai's Wu Qixiang and Qin Bi Gao did not play, and were replaced by Huang Zhendong and Huang Shijie. Qingbai kicked off, and Li Yichen led the attack, but was blocked and returned. Fei Chunhua advanced quickly along the side, passed to Kui, Xu lightly passed to Luo, Shoufu picked up the ball, and Li Sikai happened to be there, breaking the record first. Two minutes before the end of the first half, A Kui got the ball and picked it forward, and Luo Shoufu cleverly tapped the ball into the net near the goal. At the end of the first half, Qingbai won by two goals.

Second Half After a break, the two sides rejoined the battle. Qingbai replaced Gu Yisa with Li Songyun. A Kui moved to the right, and Songyun took the left wing. Shortly after the start, Li Yichen shot and hit the goalpost and bounced out. A Kui added another kick and hit the crossbar. At five minutes, Fei Chunhua and Nicolayev collided and were injured in the foot and left the field. Qin Bi Gao took to the field and guest-starred as the left midfielder. Qu Yongfu temporarily acted as a striker. At a quarter of an hour, A Fu received a ball from the right, pretended to let Yichen pass, and Li kicked it in with his left foot, with Qingbai scoring a third goal. In the melee until 30 minutes, Luo Shoufu broke into the penalty area alone. The Soviet goalkeeper came out to save, and Xiao Luo shot into the empty goal, with Qingbai winning a crushing victory with a score of 4 to 0.

### A News Reporter's View of the United Nations General Assembly

— This newspaper's October 24th airmail dispatch, Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shu-ching

This session of the United Nations General Assembly is grander than the one held in London this January. I remember that on the opening day in London, there was a misty drizzle, and thousands of British people stood in the rain to see Mrs. Roosevelt. This time in New York, the sun is warm, coinciding with the "clear skies and crisp air" of a "good season." The geographical environment is also better this time. The London meeting was held in Central Hall, with the main entrance in a narrow alley. Once the delegates' cars entered the alley, they couldn't turn around. This time, it is held in the Assembly Hall outside New York. It is in a rural area called "Flushing," with wide, flat asphalt roads, orderly and magnificent buildings, green grass, and the flags of the fifty-one allied nations fluttering. In my personal memory, although it is still far from as magnificent as the old League of Nations building in Geneva, Switzerland, as a temporary capital for a "world government," Flushing's scene is grand enough.

Over a Thousand Reporters Registered; China Accounts for One Percent

I have no way to verify when the Flushing Assembly Hall was built. I believe that the arrangement and allocation of the buildings this time are very organized and methodical. The center is the Assembly Hall, with the rostrum on the north side. The rostrum is traditionally divided into two levels, with the seats of the Assembly President Spaak and Secretary-General Lie above, and the podium for reporters or speakers below. The seats of the representatives of the fifty-one countries are arranged in three vertical rows, with the Chinese delegation in the third row of the middle row, almost in the center of all the representatives' seats. The two rows and the back row of the representatives' seats are the audience seats, attracting thousands of American people every day. The "boxes" on the upper front are the press seats, and the boxes on both sides are the "radio reporter" seats. This is an outline of the conference hall. This time, because translation is minimized as much as possible, the seats for translators and stenographers are arranged in front of the podium, unlike in the Security Council, where the translators dominate the "key positions."

Behind the conference hall are the lounge and bar for delegates and advisors, and in front of the conference hall is the cafeteria. The cafeteria is for the use of news reporters and audience members. Reporters have their own reporter bar, which is in the corner of the upstairs boxes. This time, a total of more than a thousand reporters registered (ten Chinese reporters). Many reporters only came to see the opening ceremony and did not come again afterwards.

News Department Director George: Energetic, Strong, and Patient

The director of the Assembly's News Department is Mr. Burns, George. He was originally the News Director of the United Nations Secretariat, an energetic and strong Washingtonian with balding hair. This is the most difficult news officer to be, requiring energy, strength, and extreme patience. It is not easy to deal with so many of the most difficult people in the world every day. In the days before the meeting, many reporters surrounded him, asking questions. One on the east side called, "Hello, George," and another on the west side shouted, "George, is the building ready?" One in the middle asked, "George, where do we park the car?" He answered patiently and explained every reporter's question in detail. The day before the meeting, George convened a press briefing, reporting many "important matters for reporters to note." This "briefing" was convened at the United Nations Secretariat, more than ten miles away from the Flushing venue. George said: News reporters should enter through Gate No. 8. An old American reporter below asked, "Where is Gate No. 8?" George said: "I haven't seen the venue yet. It is said to be in the northwest corner of the venue." The old reporter asked again: "Where is the northwest corner?" There were many difficult questions like this, but the Assembly's News Department did a better job than in London.

The Five Great Powers Each Have a Special Room; Chinese Newspapers Occupy One Room

The hierarchy of news reporters is not easy to divide. No one wants to admit that their news agency or newspaper is small. There are six special rooms upstairs, and George allocated them to Reuters, Associated Press, TASS, United Press, Central News Agency, and Agence France-Presse, each of the five great powers having one. In addition, there were more than ten smaller special rooms allocated to major newspapers from various countries, which inevitably led to many disputes. Shanghai Shen Bao, Nanjing Heping Daily, and New York "Time Magazine" shared one room, which was the only special room for Chinese newspapers. In addition, The New York Times occupied a room alone, and the Chicago Tribune and the New York Daily News also shared a room because the owners were relatives. Outside the special rooms was the "main writing room."

Oriental-Style Business Competition: First Seen Here

Telegraph companies soliciting business were already a "grand sight." The Wireless News Corporation, RCA Corporation, Mackay Telegraph Company, Western Union, and Submarine Telegraph Company each occupied a corner upstairs, distributing a large amount of typing paper to solicit business. These salespersons' flattery and accommodating attitude towards the reporter masters were truly unparalleled. One day, several Chinese reporters were having a small drink in the reporter bar. When it came time to pay the bill, the waiter said: Mackay Wireless Telegraph Company paid for you. I had never seen this kind of "Oriental-style" business competition in the United States before.

The Uncrowned Kings Entered the Lounge; They Scared Away the Crowned Kings

One distinction was that reporters from large news agencies mostly focused on the proceedings of the conference: the content of speeches, the key points of debates. Their telegrams were fast, and they had ample capital. Newspaper reporters mostly focused on "backstage news." As mentioned earlier, the "backstage" was divided into two parts: one was the lounge for delegates, where reporters were allowed to freely enter and talk to delegates; the other was the delegate bar, where reporters were not allowed to enter arbitrarily, unless there was an exception, which was when they were invited by a delegate. When George and the Secretariat discussed and decided on this method, their intention was good, but unexpectedly, because this group of "uncrowned kings" broke into the lounge, they scared away all the "crowned kings." For the first two or three days of the meeting, the representatives of all major countries hid in the bar, "keeping to themselves," to avoid being disturbed by reporters. Dr. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China, was stopped in the middle of his way to the restroom, through the lounge, for photos and conversations, which went on endlessly.

American Reporters Made a Face as U.S. and Soviet Representatives Strutted into the Venue

Some representatives of small countries, in order to gain more exposure, often "strolled" in the outer lounge. The Ukrainian representative Manuilsky was one of them. He knew that reporters' pens could "bring forth flowers," so he "strolled" in the lounge at any time. Unfortunately, few American reporters could recognize him: that eloquent, white-haired old comrade of Lenin's revolution.

I talked to Manuilsky several times, and I found him very kind and approachable, unlike Molotov, whose arrogance made people feel a bit resentful. A few minutes before the opening ceremony, a large group of reporters guarded the entrance where the representatives entered the venue. Molotov led the Soviet delegation, with himself in front, Vishinsky on his left, Gromyko on his right, and military advisors in Russian military uniforms behind. The large group marched in formation, their aura very majestic. For a moment, the lounge was silent and still. An American colleague looked at me and made a face.

Dr. Gu Weijun wore a very tight-fitting light black Western-style suit. He and Secretary Liu and Secretary Gu from the embassy were the second group of delegates to enter. Representative Guo Taiqi entered alone, very dashing, with a good complexion.

Truman Arrived Late: Clear Articulation and Accurate Pronunciation

President Truman deliberately arrived a few minutes late, which was for security reasons. Secret police were densely distributed around the President. Because he was the Vice President who succeeded the President, for the sake of the United States Constitution, the American people spared no effort to ensure President Truman's safety before 1948. President Truman consistently smiled at the Assembly's opening ceremony. Although the content of his address was very sharp, his scholarly and weak voice prevented the content of his speech from exploding with power. His articulation was very clear, and the syllables of every English word were pronounced very accurately. His speech was completely opposite to that of Bernards. Bernards' speech had power, his voice trembled and was hoarse, but his articulation was unclear, and the syllables were very vague.

When President Truman read his address, he occasionally made some "gestures." For example, when he said that the fear of war had not yet been dispelled, he stretched out his hands. His gestures did not match his gentle voice and slow speech. He often drank plain water, taking a sip every two or three short paragraphs.

Assembly President Spaak: Clear and Loud Belgian French

Assembly President Spaak is a veteran diplomat. His French is clear and loud. When the meeting was held in London this January, my impression of him was that he looked like Churchill. Nine months later, I think Spaak is much older and thinner. A New York newspaper vividly described Spaak's "Belgian French" and Secretary-General Lie's "Norwegian English."

Molotov Entered the Wrong Door: Major Headlines in Various Newspapers

However, the object of most reporters' attention was still Molotov. Several newspapers in New York sent dedicated reporters to follow and interview Molotov. After the opening ceremony, Molotov entered the wrong door, which was published in major headlines in various newspapers in New York.

That day, reporters rarely saw Molotov "smile" several times, which was when he was talking to Truman. He said in Russian, "I am very pleased to listen to the President's speech. It was really excellent." Molotov's attendant translator Pavlov translated it into English, and then President Truman said, "Thank you." Molotov said again: "Deeply grateful to you."

Repeating Pleasantries Over and Over: The Entire Conversation Did Not Exceed Six Sentences

Molotov smiled when he saw President's News Commissioner Roos. They shook hands intimately. Molotov said, "I have always remembered you since the Potsdam Conference!" Roos looked a little flattered.

On the night of the opening ceremony, the Astor Hotel in New York held the first evening party for delegates from various countries, and Mr. and Mrs. Truman also participated. The President spent most of his time with Molotov, and Molotov still said those few sentences: "Thank you, Mr. President," "I am very pleased to hear the President's speech." They talked "as if" they were very close. However, a reporter from the Herald Tribune described it: they repeated pleasantries over and over, and the total number did not exceed six sentences! This is called diplomacy. Let's look at this scene of what is said to be the greatest diplomacy in human history! (Sent on October 24)

### To Mr. Mao Zedong, A Letter Speaking Frankly (Part Two) "The Government of the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region" "The Central China Cultural Association"

— Advisor Zhu Yaotian

Regarding "requisitioning materials" and "confiscating property," among your economic cadres, there are those who heavily requisition goods and completely confiscate property. This is what staunch "believers" and Communist Party members should do as their duty. However, it must be said that even if your economic cadres are right in doing so, doesn't it still come down to the two phrases: "everything is for the Communist Party" and "Communist Party members never lose a penny"? If you stubbornly continue to say "everything is for the people" and "the Communist Party never wants a penny," there will certainly still be people who believe it (note: I was like that a year ago). But sounding good without looking good is ultimately not a very appropriate tune.

Let's talk about "the Party's involvement in business." The phenomena caused by your economic cadres' "involvement in business" are roughly as follows:

Insufficient rest, little transportation convenience
Buying and selling are interconnected
Big fish suck up all the Huai River water
Little fish can only face the sky

The above four lines are excerpts from "Economic Song" in my book "Things Seen and Heard in Poetry." It illustrates that all commerce in the "liberated areas" is monopolized by your cadres. To prove my point:

Here are a few typical examples

Land price signs - two wonderful uses

Let's start with the so-called "publicly-run" businesses. The "publicly-run" businesses operated by your cadres include trust companies, enterprise companies, trading companies, cooperatives at all levels, coal shops, salt shops, oil mills, cloth shops, grocery stores, cigarette shops, and bathhouses, etc. In short, except for pancake and fried dough stick shops, I have not seen comrades receiving public grain and wearing public uniforms running businesses. In other industries, it can be said that "Party members are everywhere."

There are two types of backers for publicly-run businesses. The first type is various Party, government, and military units, which are larger in scale. The second type is "honorable veterans" (i.e., disabled veterans as commonly known), which are smaller in scale.

Party, government, and military units determine the amount of "production funds" (i.e., the capital for doing business) based on the number of people in the unit. In name, this "production fund" is issued by the superiors, but in reality, it is paper money taken from the "Central China Bank." The distribution of this paper money within the original quota is interest-free. Paper money exceeding the quota, that is, the capital used to purchase a larger batch of cheap goods, only requires some interest that is almost equal to a handling fee. This illustrates that the funds for publicly-run shops that produce for the Party are unlimited and increase as needed. Therefore, they are fundamentally different from privately-run shops, which calculate interest on capital.

The operators of publicly-run shops are mostly your cadres at all levels who have transitioned from military to government, and from government to business, receiving public grain and wearing public uniforms. This means that the expenses of the shops are less than those of privately-run shops, almost to the point of having no expenses.

In buying and selling, you have the "Commodities Management Bureau" (i.e., the tax bureau as commonly known) to act as your commercial intelligence transmitter. Here is an example to illustrate the rest:

In Huaiyin, you have a relatively large trading company that mainly deals in cotton cloth and newspapers. Every day, they hang a price sign at the door for incoming and outgoing goods, which is an open marker for monopolizing the market. It has two wonderful uses:

(1) Lower the price for goods to be purchased

(2) Raise the price for goods to be sold

If someone goes to buy goods at the lower price, they will be told that it has already been sold. I have a merchant friend who is suffering miserably under this kind of clever method. The fact is this:

He saw the price sign with the deceptively high price of cotton yarn, so he bought a considerable amount of yarn in Yangzhou overnight. When he went through the first customs checkpoint for tax declaration, he clearly stated that the batch of yarn was being transported to Huaiyin. Before the batch of yarn even arrived in Huaiyin, the "Commodities Management Bureau" had already transmitted the news to the company. On the day the goods arrived in Huaiyin, the deceptive price sign was changed. Thus, my merchant friend suffered! If he doesn't sell, transferring it to another place would not only require additional transit taxes, but also the interest from the time and expense would be too much to bear. In the end, he unknowingly said, "Alas! The goods die when they reach the land!" At this point, the batch of yarn purchased at a high price was purchased by your trading company at a low price!

In addition, your cadres openly and brazenly eat public grain, wear public uniforms (i.e., your military uniforms), and carry short guns in groups to run single-handed. Anything that ordinary people are not allowed to sell, such as oxen and certain agricultural products, this group of armed single-handed traders can sell at will. Under such circumstances, what way out do small, self-funded merchants have other than "facing the sky"? As for what your senior cadres say verbally and what is written on the walls, let me advertise it for you again:

Protect national capital

Protect freedom of industry and commerce

Protect freedom of trade

Welcome national capitalists to the liberated areas

The theory of your economic policy is as above, the practice of your economic policy is the opposite of the above. Mr. Mao, what exactly is going on? I'm a little confused.

Let's talk about culture again

If thoughts are aligned, you can thrive anywhere

The culture in your "liberated areas," like the economy in the "liberated areas," is "everything is for the Communist Party." As long as you intentionally or unintentionally learn to say, "The Chinese Communist Party and the World Communist Party are both excellent, and anyone outside the Chinese Communist Party and the World Communist Party is no good," you can thrive anywhere because your thoughts are aligned. Conversely, if your thoughts are not aligned, not only will you not thrive, but you will also be given a hat labeled "spy, reactionary, stubborn element" to wear on your head. As a result, some are monitored, some are imprisoned, and some are executed. To avoid empty talk:

Learn a few typical examples

The so-called "pouring cold water" eventually fizzles out

Let's start with the general phenomenon. You suggest that the government should grant the people four major freedoms. Your newspapers and magazines say every day how the government does not grant the people four major freedoms, especially freedom of speech and publication. In order not to fire blanks, each time you cite some statistics, such as how many hundreds of publications and books were confiscated, and how many dozens of publications and bookstores were closed down. The opposite side of your loud boasting is, of course, saying that only the "liberated areas" do not confiscate publications and books, and only the "liberated areas" do not close down publications and bookstores. But the 100%, 1000% ironclad fact emerges from this issue. It turns out that your "liberated areas" fundamentally do not allow, nor is it possible to publish a publication or book that opposes "excellent" and "no good" in advance. Therefore, there is no need to confiscate or close down. This is a fact created by facts, and naturally, the entire "liberated area" has become a uniform forward culture of "excellent" and "no good"!

I'm getting too far afield. Let's talk about a typical example. This spring, playwright Mr. Song Zhi (now back in Shanghai) and Zhao Huishen (still in northern Jiangsu) went to Huaiyin for sightseeing. I met them at the entrance of the National Grand Theater, which I operate. Because I was about to put on a show and couldn't leave, I went to visit them at their residence (Qingjiang Hostel, which was later burned down) the next morning. Because it was still early, Miss Zhao had not yet gotten up, and Mr. Song had just gotten up to wash his face. After exchanging greetings, we sat down and chatted. Finally, I inadvertently mentioned the matter of Xu Jiucheng being struggled against and fined. At this time, there were three people in the room: Mr. Song, me, and a colleague from the "Central China Cultural Association." A few hours after I left the hostel, Mr. Huang Yuan, the person in charge of the "Central China Cultural Association," sent a note asking me to go to the association to talk immediately. At first, I thought it was just the old trick of "excellent" and "no good." But when I entered the door, I felt that something was wrong. Mr. Huang said with a frown, "...Speaking like that, you have forgotten your position. That is completely the way reactionary elements pour cold water..." "May I ask Mr. Huang what my position should be," I said. Mr. Huang pondered for a moment and didn't answer anything. Then he continued, "...Freedom of speech in capitalist countries is fake. Take the US radio station as an example. State-run radio stations do not allow ordinary people to speak. Private radio stations run by big capitalists also do not allow ordinary people to speak. Ordinary people can only shout on the street, and no one cares..." I interjected, "Mr. Huang, what I said today was in the Qingjiang Hostel room, and the only person who heard it was Mr. Song Zhi. I didn't shout on the street..." Finally, in an unpleasant atmosphere, this case of "pouring cold water" on freedom of speech was finally dropped. This is the first typical example.

"Liberated Area" actors register with nine agencies

The second typical example is this: For a period of time, your newspapers and publications published daily and in large headlines, special articles, news, and reprints about the government's oppression of Shanghai's new and old actors to register, and the opposition of new and old actors to register with the government. The opposite side of your loud boasting seems to be saying again that only actors in the "liberated areas" do not need to register. However, the fact is completely the opposite. Your cadres oppose Shanghai actors registering with one agency, the Shanghai Social Bureau, but your "liberated areas" ordered actors to register with nine agencies simultaneously in Huaiyin, a city with a population of only 40,000. Moreover, each actor's registration resume must include everything from when they left their mother's womb, how they lived, how they learned to act, who they learned to act from, how many years they studied, how many years they performed, and where they have been, etc. As the person in charge of the National Grand Theater, as the general manager of the National Grand Theater with more than 100 male and female staff and actors, I once used a secretary specifically to write this stuff every day. Because the registration resume was not detailed enough, it was rejected twice and rewritten. I hereby list the names of the nine agencies below:

(1) Town Government

(2) District Government

(3) Public Security Bureau of the District Government

(4) Municipal Government

(5) Municipal Public Security Bureau

(6) General Bureau of Public Security of the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region

(7) Huaiyin Garrison Headquarters

(8) Department of Education of the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region

(9) Central China Cultural Association

Because of the unreasonableness of registering in nine places, I, as the general manager of the National Grand Theater, protested to all parties. Because I could not take responsibility for the saying "...There are many spies in Huaiyin, everyone should be vigilant in many ways, otherwise if something goes wrong, who will be responsible...", I had to register separately in the order of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine! But at this time, your basic masses were cursing your ancestors for eight generations! This I heard with my own ears.

Culture · Military · Others

Children's theater troupe performs, borrows the venue without paying

Let me tell you about something even more rogue than a rogue. More than two months ago, your Central China Military Region's children's theater troupe, later renamed the Experimental Third Theater Troupe, whose director at the time was your mid-level cadre Comrade Wu, now transferred to the Liaison Department of the Central China Military Region, wanted to borrow the National Grand Theater to perform for three days, to make some extra money. He asked a Mr. Ding to discuss the conditions with me. Because everyone was in the theater business, the result was that the National Grand Theater only charged the children's theater troupe a loss fee of 3,000 yuan per day. All backstage staff and actors helped as usual. Your Director Wu, in order to express his gratitude, that evening, helped the National Grand Theater perform two short plays to show mutual assistance. Three days passed, and the children's theater troupe received more than 50,000 yuan in ticket revenue for the three days. This was probably another example of the "Communist Party members never lose a penny" style. Your Director Wu said to me with a red face, "Sorry, government theater troupes should not pay to perform in government buildings..." Thus, the 9,000 yuan loss for three days was cheated out of. Later, after my serious protest, a portion was recovered from the "Central China Cultural Association," but the more than 100 staff and actors of the National Grand Theater had an even deeper understanding of your cadres!

Finally, let me tell you about the cultural performance of one of your senior cadres. After Wang Ruofei, Qin Bangxian, Ye Ting, and others died in a plane crash, Huaiyin held a large-scale memorial service. The location was on the stage of the National Grand Theater. In addition to the senior cadres from the entire Central China region, representatives from various units also attended the memorial service. First, Mr. Fan Changjiang made a crowing sound and recited the eulogy while crying. Then, a vivid speech began. I can't remember how many senior cadres gave speeches, but the content of each person's speech was almost identical. In terms of great consistency, it was indeed impressive. However, I always felt that you were not holding a memorial service that day. This can be proved by the consistency of the words of your senior cadres and the towering eulogies of several feet. Below is the original text of the consistent words and text:

Old thief shameless, destroying the Political Consultative Conference
Heroes suffered disaster, vow to pull out Black Tea Mountain

The Three-Step Process in Communist Party Military Teams

I believe that military affairs is the best of your measures. In fact, although it is the same as politics, economy, and culture, it is "everything is for the Communist Party," it is indeed passable in open and covert competition. But this must refer to the military collectives that have not been separated. As for those who come out to engage in production, that is, those who come out to do business on behalf of the army, and the demobilized disabled and sick soldiers, these people are often considered separately.

Your "excellent" and "no good" statements have indeed had a great effect in your army. The acquisition of this effect is also achieved through the three-step process. The order of the three-step process is roughly as follows:

(1) First give them everything at will

(2) Then give them enough to eat and wear warmly

(3) Then instill the excellent and no good statements

Because these people are mostly those who cannot survive in modern society, once they have enough to eat and wear warmly, and feel that everything is at will, they become truly or falsely "excellent" and "no good" for the sake of their real lives. I have personally seen your cadres who have not left the army for ten years burst into tears when talking about their future. I don't think he would have had this mood when he first tasted the three-step process?

Here are a few typical examples

Visiting experts, actually discovered living signs

Along the banks of the "liberated area" canal, there are many historically significant buying and selling businesses, mainly dealing in coal, salt, oil, and other agricultural products. Because of your saying that "buying and selling businesses are exploitative," all the historically significant businesses run by ordinary people in the entire "liberated area" were completely closed down! But soon after, they were all renovated and reopened on auspicious days. When I walked into each expert's house for sightseeing, I found that each house had a living sign wearing a public uniform and carrying a short gun. It turned out that your cadres did not allow ordinary people to open businesses, but allowed "honorable veterans" to open businesses (Note: Honorable veterans are demobilized disabled and sick soldiers). In order to live, merchants had to spend a lot of money, provide dry shares (i.e., shares that only share profits but do not contribute capital), and ask relatives and friends to invite such a living sign to earn a living for the whole family. Mr. Mao! I think you probably don't know about this not-so-small masterpiece?

Let me tell you another seemingly joking military story. The theater I operate is a professional theater, and I am fully responsible for the living expenses and salaries of more than 100 staff and actors. The rent for your auditorium and the disaster relief fees are indispensable. In order to treat the military favorably, I have always charged only half price. Every day, three or five soldiers freeloading has become a regular phenomenon. The military story I want to tell is only larger in scale and more peculiar in method. The fact is this:

One night, when the show was in progress, a few trumpeters came first, each holding a trumpet standing on both sides of the entrance. Then, batches of dozens of unarmed soldiers came. Under the command of a ready command, the charge sounded "di di da da". Thus, dozens of warriors rushed in like an angry tide. At this time, the door was smashed, the doorman was knocked to the ground, the actors were stunned, and the audience ran away. Under the circumstances of not performing or watching, your basic masses cursed you and your ancestors, but then a new show began. Mr. Mao, do you know about these masterpieces?

Let's talk about the people again

A leader pressing on my head is really uncomfortable

The saying "serving the people" is a new slogan that your cadres changed from the old slogan "everything is for the people" when talking about "new democracy." In order to first explain the truth that "the Communist Party does not serve the people" but rather "the people serve the Communist Party," let me first tell a fact that I have already mentioned above.

In the entire "liberated area," especially on the city walls at the entrances of various cities, and on all large buildings, your giant portraits of several feet are all painted. On the upper left side of each giant portrait, giant characters with dazzling red light are written. The original text is "Chinese People's Leader Mao Zedong." My feeling the first time I saw these words was this: I am one of the people of the mountains, and I am also one of the revolutionaries who sympathize with them. But suddenly discovering a leader pressing on my head from mid-air, I felt really uncomfortable. Later, I thought that if the word "people" was changed to the word "Communist Party," it would seem more consistent with the name and reality. Finally, I thought that it was not appropriate to change it like this. China is now a multi-party country. If each party competed to paint leaders on the city walls, even if they did not break their heads to compete for status, I think it is a waste in China where material resources are difficult. I don't know what Mr. Mao thinks?

Writing folk ditties becomes a people's writer

Your senior cultural cadres told me that you have also achieved unprecedented success in the cultural department of "serving the people." In order to prove the facts, you specially introduced me to your people's writer Mr. Miao. According to Mr. Miao, he came from the fields and only studied in private schools for a few years. He is now able to write some things entirely due to the call of the Party. His works are mostly folk ditties, and the sentences are similar to the clappers of "tighten the clappers, slow down, and come to the sesame cake shop." The following is an excerpt from Mr. Miao's great work:

The Eighth Route Army has always won battles
The New Fourth Army is skillful in martial arts
Everyone thanks the Communist Party
They are better than our own parents

From the tone of this great article, you can get the answer to the question: "Does the Communist Party serve the people?" or "Do the people serve the Communist Party?"

Let me tell you another story about a public trial of "serving the people." On the day before the public trial, your cadres ordered the village chiefs, and the village chiefs then ordered the people. The original words of the order were: "Tomorrow morning at eight o'clock, send one person from your family with a weapon in hand to gather at my place. No matter on the street or at the meeting place, whatever slogan I shout, you must follow me and shout the same slogan. Whoever doesn't shout, I will settle accounts with them when they come back, remember..."

The next night, a person who participated in the public trial said to me with tears in his eyes, "...It's really a sin, a sin. I have never heard of the person being publicly tried. I don't even know what bad things he did, but the village chief led the shouting, demanding that the government execute this bad guy, and I was forced to shout too. You say, if this dead ghost has a spirit and comes to me to settle accounts, what should I say to him? From this public trial story, you can also get the answer to the question: "Does the Communist Party serve the people?" or "Do the people serve the Communist Party?"

Let me tell you another story about an escape of "serving the people." There are millions of people from your Central China "liberated area" who have fled outside. One day, I talked to the cadre responsible for your struggle about the problem of people fleeing. The great theory of your struggle cadre was this: "...There are four types of people who have fled outside the liberated area: the first type is traitors, the second type is landlords, the third type is local bullies, and the fourth type is bad guys..." I asked him, "Then among these millions of people, is there not even one good person?" Your struggle cadre rolled his eyes at me, as if he was saying in his heart, "This guy's thoughts are still not aligned." At that time, I really couldn't help it. I said sternly and affirmatively, "If there is one good person among the millions of people who have fled outside, you, the person responsible for the struggle, should also bear full responsibility." In an unhappy "goodbye," the conversation on the issue of escape ended.

Theory, Party affairs, politics, economy, culture, military affairs, and the people have been "speaking frankly" in general. As for whether it is well-intentioned, malicious, or non-well-intentioned and non-malicious personal opinions, I am not in a position to say. Mr. Mao will understand after reading it, and others who read it will naturally understand. (September 20, 1946)

Movies and Drama Published Every Sunday

### Dramatic Exercises for Youths or Children

— Xiang Peiliang

To establish drama education on par with other arts education, such as fine arts and music, the foundation lies in creative activities. The first issue to resolve is the position of drama performed by youths or children. From an artistic standpoint, what status does it hold? This type of drama certainly isn't a mature artistic masterpiece; it can only be considered an exercise. On the other hand, drama education only has value if it can succeed artistically.

This issue is about the relationship between exercises and artistic finished products. And because drama has its own unique circumstances, the problem becomes more complex. Drama's unique circumstances are: (1) using the human body as a tool for creating art; (2) the creator is not an individual, but a group of people who rely on each other—the entire cast in a performance, and this group must also rely on some people not seen by the audience; (3) relying on many material conditions; (4) direct contact with the appreciator (audience) and immediate influence from their reactions.

It is clear that exercises, especially early works, cannot be called works of art. However, works of art can only gradually grow from long-term exercises. The process in between is long and has no discernible segments. It is impossible to definitively separate exercises from finished works of art. If exercises are not art, how can they achieve artistic effects?

At first glance, this is a contradictory phenomenon, but it can be resolved by the attitudes of those who discuss art from ancient times to the present. To explain in detail, one must naturally argue from both the perspectives of creation and appreciation to encompass the entirety of art, but those who discuss it from ancient times to the present mostly lean towards creation. In our country, the Confucian school's "poetry is where the will goes," Zhong Rong's "living in seclusion from a young age, poverty and lowliness are easily endured," the Southern Liang era's "green feelings, ornate and delicate, lingering sorrowful thoughts," Li Zhi's theory of child-like innocence, and the Three Yuan's theory of innate sensibility developed from it: all argue from the perspective of creation. In the West, Aristotle's theory of emotional catharsis, Kant's pure beauty, Tolstoy's theory of emotional transmission, and Croce's theory of intuition all argue from the perspective of creation. The activity of creation is direct and evident; appreciation sometimes seems non-existent. The process of creation gradually develops from the most blurred image until the final completion of the work, passing through slowly and deeply. Appreciation, on the other hand, requires less mental activity and time, and the gains vary in depth from person to person, differing greatly. Therefore, in terms of the impact on people, although the scope of appreciation is broad, creation is more in-depth. Therefore, from an educational standpoint, creative activity is more powerful and the main part; appreciation is the auxiliary part.

Speaking solely of creation, there is no difference between exercises and finished works of art, except for pure imitation. Creation is an activity process, and physical activity, except for verbal art, plays an important role. Therefore, the core of creation lies in the activity itself. As for the results of the activity, the so-called works of art, they are not as important. Only from the standpoint of appreciation is there a clear distinction between exercises and works of art. As for creation, this distinction is neither clear nor important. In terms of creative activity itself, the depth of spirit of a four-year-old child drawing simple outlines on the ground is no different from that of a great painter constructing his masterpiece. Therefore, even though the finished products of youths or children engaged in artistic creation are childish and laughable, the educational effect has already been achieved.

Once the four special circumstances of drama mentioned above are studied, it can be known that they make drama more suitable as an educational institution. The special circumstances of drama explain how drama relies on the human body while using fewer tools, relies more on external conditions, and can never be completely controlled by one person. Therefore, theoretically, drama can never achieve technical perfection. Furthermore, because each performance is equivalent to a new activity without practice, it makes technical perfection even more difficult to achieve. Therefore, there is no clear boundary between dramatic exercises and dramatic masterpieces of art. The mood of children's simplest role-playing games is closer to the performances of the greatest actors, and its impact on their own minds and bodies is more in-depth than that of other artistic exercises.

Therefore, setting aside appreciation and speaking solely from the standpoint of creation, there is no doubt about the artistic position of dramatic exercises for youths or children. And drama education in schools is mainly based on students performing themselves; watching drama is only an auxiliary position. Therefore, the foundation of drama education is very solid, but there are still many theoretical and practical problems to be solved in implementing drama education in schools, so it cannot be said that it has officially begun.

### Praise for "The Stone Flower"

— Zhu Lei

A Soviet Color Film

"The Stone Flower" surprisingly defeated American films, which are known for their color, and won the top prize for color films at the World Film Competition held in France this time.

From the color film "Nightingale Song," which was released in Shanghai eight years ago, to today's "The Stone Flower," we can see that the Soviet Union has made amazing progress in color. Compared with American films, which excel in rich detail, Soviet films excel in freshness and closeness to nature.

The story's subject matter is taken from a Ural folk tale, narrating how a young gemstone craftsman wants to use his talent and craftsmanship to complete a gemstone flower-style cup, but this divine flower is not easy to obtain in the world. He can only complete it with his own imagination, unable to seek its true likeness. Therefore, on every starry night, he has reveries, looking for an opportunity to see this heavenly wonder flower, which, according to folk legend, blooms only once a year. The witch in the forest appears and promises to lead him, but he must use love as an exchange condition. He already has a betrothed wife whom he loves deeply, so to seek the highest art, he resolutely follows the witch on his wedding night. He eventually sees the stone flower bloom and creates a perfect work of art, and repeatedly resists the witch's seductive temptations, completing his marriage with his love.

The theme of this film, according to the film's description, is that artistic works hidden in famous mountains and deep valleys cannot be considered works of art; only when they reach the hands of the people do they have artistic value. But I think that to obtain true art, one should excavate from the beauty of nature to achieve the highest achievement, whether it be music, painting, sculpture, literature... all cannot escape this example.

The greatest success of this film is that the construction of each frame has been carefully planned by film artists. The angle, setting, composition, atmosphere, and color harmony form pages of dazzling oil paintings. You can randomly cut a vibrant frame and take it home to frame and receive people's surprise and admiration. Scenes such as the horn-blowing in the forest, reveries in the deep night, gatherings to listen to stories, and the old man sitting alone in the gemstone workshop, are beautiful and profound enough to leave you speechless. The actors are also excellent, each reaching the depth of the personality and connotation of the role they play. The composure and stability of the young sculptor, the weakness and pity of the old sculptor, the violent ferocity of the gemstone factory owner, and the strange yin and yang of the marquis are all exceptionally outstanding. It is a pity that the ending of the whole story is slightly weak, and the scenery of the mountain stones and the colorful lights in the last few scenes gradually become cliché, far from the novel and beautiful shots full of natural atmosphere at the beginning of the film.

### Zhao Dan and Qin Yi Kissing in a Scene from "Distant Love"

### Weekly Film Short Reviews

— Zhu Xi

A good film shown before the war, originally translated as "Fleeting Dreams." Every actor has a wonderful performance to watch, especially the ending harmonica will linger in your mind and heart for a long time, and it also brings the感慨 of life and what is a "happy family."

Reunion Day

The script is written very deeply, and some places are also very delicate.

The intention of introducing the male and female protagonists at the beginning is very good, using dialogue and action to express the characteristics of the two, but unfortunately, the process of the play lacks a breath and cannot immediately or immediately make its original intention accepted by the audience. By the time everyone understands the intention of this appearance, it may not be possible for every audience member.

The scene of buying clothes is the most skilled and meaningful.

琴逑罗吉丝 played the best, and Shirley Temple's performance was too tender. 佐瑟夫考彭 is above competent.

Tide of Passion

Also a famous work by Hilton, far inferior to "Random Harvest."

The ending turns too fast, with the style of "saving people under the knife" in our country's popular romances.

The male and female protagonists are above average, and the supporting actor George Sanders has many scenes and is also very good.

Peach Troubles

The beginning of the play is good, using the ending of Hardy's previous work "Under the Greenwood Tree," being delayed in the train for a long time without making the audience feel bored, but later it became loose; the subject matter was also grabbed at will, after all, the stage play has been arranged to the fourteenth book, it is impossible for every book to be wonderful.

龐妮泰荷蘭薇, who plays Hardy's new girlfriend, is mediocre. The twin sisters are just using "twins," and there is no great hope.

Moroccan Bound

Among the series of films "Road to ××," this one is not as gimmicky as the previous two (this film was originally named "Road to Morocco"). Often a certain section starts very well, but soon after it falls into a state of stagnation, like the shadow of Delores Lamo in the desert, Bing Crosby singing in the palace, and the final battle and escape, etc.

The actors are still average, but not good; Bob at least put in effort, Dolores is always "lukewarm."

叶凤黛卡洛 can be seen in the array of beauties, she was not yet famous at that time.

### On the Direction and Design of "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace"

— Jing Wen

The script of "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace" has already been evaluated, so I won't repeat it. This time, the director of the performance is also the playwright. Of course, it will feel familiar and better understand how to handle the script for a playwright to direct his own play. Some emotions that cannot be expressed in the words of the script can be expressed by himself in the direction. However, on the contrary, if everything from the script to the performance is done by one person, then there will often be some places that are not taken care of. Perhaps another director will adopt another method, and the effect of the performance may be different. In the performance, we saw Yang Cunbin's talent in direction, careful but not trivial, organized and not chaotic, and the ups and downs of the plot were grasped just right. From the opening to the closing, the whole play is like the mighty Yangtze River, sometimes turbulent, sometimes calm, flowing smoothly, clear, compact, and not appearing lengthy and procrastinating. From the concubine selection in the second act and the birthday celebration in the fourth act, we know that the director is good at handling large scenes, with many people but not chaotic, and the pictures are arranged very beautifully, which further highlights the atmosphere at that time. The slightly inferior one is the fifth act. This act itself is a bit messy in the script. From the script, everything that happens in the plot must come to an end in this act, and at the same time, the author must start to lay the main foreshadowing for his "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace II: The Guangxu Reform." Furthermore, due to the influence of the plot of this act, the performance in the direction is sometimes rigid and sometimes fragmented, and the emotions given to the audience are also intermittent, which is slightly inferior compared to the first four acts.

The conditions that constitute the scenery are nothing more than lines, colors, and composition. The different uses of these conditions can express remote villages, thatched huts, or prosperous cities, tall buildings, and even this time's Great Qing Dynasty, the majestic palace. As soon as the curtain was drawn, I marveled at the designer of the installation, Li Enjie, who used it to the fullest. The painted pavilions, carved beams, and majestic pillars were enough to express the atmosphere of the palace, used so vividly and concisely, without appearing cumbersome. Especially in the fourth act, on such a small stage, he vividly expressed the depth and breadth of the Summer Palace. What is used more skillfully is the four large pillars and two horizontal pavilions that have not moved on the stage and behind the stage. The designer relies on these pillars to lock the audience in the palace. However, there seem to be too many small objects on the wall of the emperor's study in the second and third acts, which makes the atmosphere not grand enough.

### Enthusiastic Audience

— Xiao Min

The "Made in China" new film "Suicide Squad," originally named "Song of the Police Soul," was premiered at the Shanghai Guang Theater a few days ago, and the overcrowding was unprecedented.

These days, some policemen often use their power to force their way into the Shanghai Guang Theater without tickets. Of course, the ticket collectors are not very willing. A policeman said fiercely:

"You be careful!"

"Why?" The ticket collector was unwilling to show weakness for the sake of his duty, and almost started a fight, but he was persuaded to stop because there were too many people. "Be careful, what does that mean?" A spectator in American military uniform seemed to be speaking out of injustice, and glared at him with a contemptuous look because of the policeman's attitude.

"Patrol Officer Zhou" is ultimately an ideal character! When will we be able to appreciate the faces of the policemen trained under the all-knowing and all-powerful Patrol Officer Zhou?

### New Film Ramblings

— Ma Boliang

Nation Above All

In a peaceful era or on a night of raging war, we imagine a clear love in the flames of war. A wall, one day the entire world civilization is destroyed, burned, bombed, and collapsed, and maybe there is such a wall left. In the wilderness, a man and a woman meet again under this wall; or a bomb shelter, in the sound of mountains collapsing and earth cracking, a man and a woman meet after countless vicissitudes, and at this time they have a little subtle truth, a flash of time in thousands of years. Eric Knight is a dreamer like us, but this flash flies too fast, he can't grasp it, the glorious deserter and the aristocratic girl can't preserve it, and the director Lee Falk can't trace it. It's over, leaving no desolate gesture. The love in "Nation Above All" has a lingering feeling, and we do feel the brilliance of love, but it doesn't have the sentimental mood, the whispers in the hazy night, the hurried first kiss in the haystack, the small talk in front of the window with lake and mountain scenery, are just a few quiet pictures. In the end, Lee Falk did not faithfully adapt the original work to suit American tastes: the death of the male protagonist did not bring people two cold tears, not even a miserable murmur. Joan Fontaine's love expression really has the full expectations of a girl, and Taylor Power added a steadiness that he never had before. This makes us only remember the fluttering shadow of a couple running and bumping in the pouring rain. They all know what they need, so frank, sincere, and light, but they can't be forever.

Tide of Passion

The original work of the novel craftsman Hilton, making twists and turns and bizarre is still his nature. Like "Random Harvest," he once again uses mental patients as the subject matter. This time, the jealous and suspicious husband is portrayed quite subtly. Killing cats is his first sign, and the subsequent gradual development of conspiracy is more reasonable than "Random Harvest." This film has a good development of the plot. Although it describes suspicious people like "Suspicion" and "Rebecca," it has a very strong taste of legendary drama. If Van Dyke were Hitchcock, his directing technique would make "Tide of Passion" stained with mystery, tension, and terror. Now, his bland technique is only to smoothly introduce the plot, just competent. The foot shadow in the gap of the door in the section of attempting to harm his wife, the procedure of suicide, and the jokes of grabbing the letter and making a strong phone call are the best handled. Other confessions lack atmosphere and color, and the dubbing effect is useless. The ending is too cliché. Robert Montgomery and the actor of the old French doctor have very good results. Ingrid Bergman was not yet famous at that time, and her skills were not as good as Joan Fontaine.

I think "Tide of Passion" is a work around the standard line, and Hilton cannot escape the cliché.

Comrade X

Of course, Hilton is inferior to Steinbeck, but he is really a writer, and his works do not have brilliance and brilliance, but they have purity and brightness. "Comrade X" is an excellent film, or it is definitely not inferior to "The Life of Emile Zola." It is a story closely related to William Saroyan's "The Human Comedy." Steinbeck never wanders in the circle of dreams. From "The Grapes of Wrath" to now, he has been pursuing the essence of human nature. The background of "Comrade X" is the same as "The Westerner," a small seaside town. MGM bravely tried to bring tramps to the screen, expressing a corner of life in a brisk tempo. The archetype of the cunning rogue is created unprecedentedly. Director Victor Fleming's technique is smooth and novel, impeccable, worthy of having works like "Gone with the Wind." Spencer Tracy's performance is perfect, with depth in nature, which is truly enjoyable, and John Garfield and H. B. Warner can understand the taste of it and have outstanding performances. Hedy Lamarr doesn't have many scenes. The director knows her timidity and tries his best to show the brilliance of her eyes. The picture is beautiful, with scenery from beginning to end, which makes "Comrade X" a truly literary film!

Man From The Alamo

Lafcadio Hearn said that although we extremely dislike all hardships, they all help to increase our wisdom. Sam Houston is a person who has cultivated wisdom through hardships. "Man From The Alamo" may be his epic, but I vaguely remember the movie I saw four or five years ago. I can't remember how much heroic spirit Richard Dix's Houston had in the battle. I only vaguely remember how his marriage with the aristocratic daughter Ellie, who was forced to marry him, broke down. It was on the night he was elected governor again. A row of lights under the Houston speech platform shook his bloody life and reflected the iron hooves and wolves on the battlefield. I still vaguely remember Houston's sorrow.

### Improving the "Literary Tea Party"

— Hualin, Chen Chengyin, Xu Zhongnian

(I)

Brother Zhongnian:

I think the "Literary Tea Party" needs to be further developed. It would be best if you could come to the Xueyuan on Saturday afternoon to discuss it. I think individual conversations are better than lectures. The most important thing is to make appointments in advance and have one or two items on the program: music and singing, or bring one or two works to comment on. It is even more important to invite family members to participate. The atmosphere should be relaxed and not too tense. What do you think, brother? Your brother, Hualin, respectfully. November 3rd.

(II)

Brothers Chuntai and Zhongnian:

The "Literary Tea Party" has been held twice, and I have some thoughts, which I am writing down to discuss with you two.

Perhaps I have become more worldly, but I often feel that every gathering should give something to people, otherwise, some people may feel empty. In fact, many things in the world are both empty and real, all subjective. Therefore, even monks with pure six senses still have to worry about firewood and rice. But we want to make this "Literary Tea Party" lively and colorful, so it seems like we need something.

What is this something? In the past, there was a publication where anyone with similar interests could publish articles. We cannot do that immediately now, but we can try.

In addition, we can also promote some programs at each meeting. For example, we can prepare some paper and drawing tools, so those who love to draw and write can do so on the spot, either as a gift or to be kept in the association as a fund. Those who like to sing can prepare a zither and a flute. Brothers Gu Zhongyi and Zhao Jingshen can invite some musicians to participate. There are also many poets who can recite their masterpieces. These things can be tried.

We don't want this association to have too much mechanical function, but if we want to make it lively and often gain something from this association, we can try it. That's how I feel, I don't know if you brothers agree?

If this is feasible, the content of the association will be richer, and there will be more friends. Everyone in the literary and art circles gathers here (relatively speaking, of course). Our aimless gathering seems to have a purpose unintentionally, of course, except for politics.

Busy people are always busy, as long as it's not too vulgar and doesn't involve politics, I hope the two brothers will promote it, and I can only be a supporting player. Your brother, Yin, respectfully. Evening of the 3rd.

(III)

Brothers Lin and Yin:

I have read your letters one after the other, and have also shown them to Chuntai. We completely agree with your opinions.

The "Literary Tea Party" has been revived and has been idle for two sessions, and the participants have been very enthusiastic. If the number of people in the second session was relatively small, it was because the second session was held in the Wucenglou Restaurant, in rooms one, two, and three. It was originally easy to find, but a certain school was holding a meeting in front, blocking the way, so we had to make two more turns and go through the kitchen. As a result, the "tea seats" were wider and quieter than the first time, but quite a few people decreased because they couldn't find the place. I met a new tea friend, Mr. Wu Xiuye, who was one of those who got lost. Also, my nephew, Zhu Qiwu, led six or seven friends to participate, but mistakenly entered the alumni seats of a certain school, spending more than three times the price to eat a meal for no reason! I think we should use those three rooms for the next tea party and make it fixed, and improve the access routes, so the participants will definitely not be fewer.

Objectively speaking, the results of these two sessions can at least be given 75 points, but it is a pity that they were a little "solemn"! Seriousness is not what we want, as Brother Lin said: "The atmosphere should be relaxed and not too tense." There are three factors that cause this solemnity: (1) In terms of spirit, our old tea friends seem to have suffered from the saying "to understand worldly affairs thoroughly is to acquire knowledge, and to be skilled in human relationships is to write great articles." We are not as innocent as we were fourteen years ago, and our words and deeds are more cautious than before, so our emotions are not as unrestrained. (2) In terms of material conditions, life after the war is much more difficult than before the war, and it is inevitable that we writers have some worries, so it is difficult to enjoy ourselves to the fullest. (3) In terms of age, our old tea friends are already "half-old men with dim vision, gray hair, and shaking teeth." The young new tea friends always feel a little uncomfortable when they see us. They are facing the prime of their lives, and it is just right to talk about love, but among us, except for Hualin, no one has this interest! However, given time, these three factors can be overcome. Next time, I plan to invite a few senior elders to participate: in front of them, we can feel twenty years younger!

Yes, before each tea party, we must prepare something in advance. In fact, fourteen years ago, we also held small-scale art exhibitions, concerts, excursions, and so on. In addition to these, we can also hold very meaningful visits. For example, Dr. Liu Yongchun participated in our "Literary Tea Party" this time; next time or another time, we will visit the Pasteur Institute hosted by Dr. Liu, and ask him to lead us and explain it to us: isn't it good to increase our knowledge? We can also visit the "Xin" and "Shen" newspaper offices; we can also visit the Commercial Press and the Zhonghua Book Company; we can also visit film shoots, baking biscuits (Mr. Xi Guansheng once invited us to feast on sandwich biscuits and ice cream), and so on. With our collective strength, we can be worthy of the words "extensive social connections": why should we worry about not seeing, not hearing, or even not eating? The problem is that someone has to be willing to run errands; when it comes to running errands, you two old brothers, Chuntai, and little me are all top-notch!

Speaking of publications, our "Yu Kan" is not non-existent, nor is it small in number; it is a pity that we lack our own "Literary Tea Party," and the strength cannot be concentrated! I am trying to revive the publication, and I hope you old brothers will help. According to the current market price, 3 million yuan can print 100,000 words. Furthermore, life used to be cheaper, and for the sake of interest, we could hire editors on a volunteer basis and write articles on a volunteer basis; now inflation is rampant, and it is really "time is money," and for the sake of our stomachs, we have to add a little decoration. If we don't have the strength ourselves, we have to attack the daily newspaper and start with a weekly magazine.

In addition to friendship, - friendship is the soul of the "Literary Tea Party," - the "Literary Tea Party" should have an active altruistic function: I think of the tea friends who are younger than us. The older tea friends who attend, with one exception (that is, little me), are all authorities in the literary and art circles: why don't they teach the younger brothers? Therefore, even though the "Literary Tea Party" is held on schedule as usual, we can also hold systematic "academic lectures," organize a "Youth Writing Guidance Committee" in name and in fact, establish an amateur "painting academy," and even prepare for a drama troupe, and so on. What we have is talent without "bei" (money), and what we lack is wealth with "bei" (money): if everyone works hard and gathers some funds to make up for the lack, then it will be perfect.

I have been dealing directly with society for sixteen years. Sixteen years of experience have turned me into an enlightened optimist and a believer in active skepticism. I have an iron will and the spirit of a horse: enough for the use of you old brothers and all tea friends! Your brother, Zhongnian, respectfully. March 5, November 5, Tuesday.

### Classical Period Works

— Bi Jasha

### Random Recollections of the Art World

— Zhan Weng

Layman Daqian claimed that his eyes could see ghosts. Someone asked about the appearance of ghosts. He said: Ghosts are just human-shaped gas bodies. They appear day and night, everywhere, and avoid people quickly. Their behavior is laughable. Sometimes they are caught off guard and scattered by people. After a long time, the gas gradually dissipates, and they return to their old appearance. Every time I see two people coming face to face, each trying to avoid the other, they often end up side by side. This is a common occurrence, but there is actually a ghost in it. I have tried it many times and it never fails.

When Daqian lived in Jiashan, the old house of Zhenyi was very spacious and had a gloomy atmosphere. He once told me that one day he got up before dawn and stepped out of the room, and immediately encountered a ghost. The ghost looked familiar, but he couldn't remember his name for a while. After breakfast, he suddenly remembered. He falsely claimed that he wanted to make new clothes and ordered his servant to summon a tailor named Jia. The servant returned and reported that Jia had died of illness half a month ago. Daqian kept it to himself and didn't dare to tell his family. Although his words were conclusive, I still didn't dare to believe them.

Qi Baishi is eighty-six years old. Ten years ago, he still had a healthy concubine and a lovely child. In his spare time from painting, this old man often enjoyed playing with his child. He would hold candy and throw it far away on the ground, ordering the child to pick it up and enjoy his laughter.

I once traveled with Baishi. Baishi always carried hundreds of coins with him. When he saw beggars by the roadside, he would give them to them one by one. When he saw people with ragged clothes in the distance, he would definitely ask the coachman to call them to him, and after confirming that they were beggars, he would give them a coin. As a result, beggars gathered in droves, begging in turn. Baishi couldn't handle it, so he threw all his money away, letting the beggars scramble for it. Baishi was very happy to see this, and the passersby were also amused.

Baishi learned carpentry as a child, and was appreciated by Mr. Wang Renqiu, and began to study with him. His paintings have always had a unique talent and formed his own style, which is not surprising. What is surprising is that his poems and songs are also quite good; Old Man Fanshan once selected his best works and had them printed. Although there are minor flaws in the prosody, the overall truthfulness and expressiveness are thought-provoking. Baishi never concealed his old profession, and once introduced me to Chen San'yuan, the Lord of Yangning. When they met, he immediately said, "I haven't read any books." Mr. San didn't know how to answer when he heard this. After thinking for a while, he replied, "Precisely because you didn't read books in your youth, you were able to reach this state, which makes people admire you even more." Baishi's frankness and sincerity can be seen from this.

It was reported that Pu Xinyu flew to Beijing to open an art exhibition, and the chairman summoned him, which was praised by public opinion. Although Xinyu was a royal descendant, he had no aristocratic habits. He chose the Jieshoutang of Wanshou Mountain and left behind his calligraphy and paintings. He originally lived in Prince Gong's Mansion, which also had the beauty of rockeries and flowers and trees. Before the war, he sold it due to poverty. After the Anti-Japanese War, he made a living by selling paintings, and his livelihood became even more difficult. Wang Yitang repeatedly wanted to give him a fake position, but he was politely rejected. His noble character is admired by the world. Xinyu not only criticized Yitang for his actions, but also did not extremely oppose the puppet emperor Puyi. He especially spoke with hatred about the cruelty of the Japanese invaders. Occasionally, when discussing national affairs, he admired Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's character, believing that the country and nation could not be saved without the War of Resistance, and that final victory would be achieved. His love for the country was overflowing in his words. The world only sees him as a painter who is indifferent to fame and fortune, but they have failed to see into Xinyu's heart. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won and the sky is shining again, Xinyu's opening of an art exhibition in the capital actually contains infinite significance. The chairman summoned and comforted this loyal painter, and Xinyu can also be proud of himself.

Mr. Huang Binhong is eighty-three years old this year. He has devoted his entire life to epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting. In terms of his profound attainments, there is probably no one in the world who can surpass him. Binhong has lived in Beiping for many years. The house he lives in was recently acquired by a landlord, who suddenly increased the rent hundreds of times. Binhong could not afford it, and the landlord humiliated him in every possible way, forcing him to move. Binhong could not bear the harassment and had to move elsewhere. Recently, he sent me a letter filled with complaints. In this chaotic world, there is almost no place for law-abiding citizens to stand. It is infuriating to hear this. Binhong is famous for painting landscapes; I don't know that he occasionally paints flowers, also drawing from ancient masters, different from the vulgar. Recently, I saw his painting of a rhododendron branch, which was simple and lovely. Binhong said that he had been practicing flower painting for thirty years, but had not yet achieved anything, and did not dare to show it to the world, but he had never stopped for a day. How could the diligence of the predecessors be dreamed of by the young people!

Today's people often value empty fame when evaluating paintings. In fact, unknown painters may not be completely without merit. Twenty years ago, I saw Yu Shengming, who painted plum blossoms, drawing from Chao Lin Wang Ji, and his paintings were light and elegant, as if wanting to escape from the mundane world. Later, I saw his paintings at a friend's place and had a great conversation. Mr. Yu was very poor, and although his paintings were priced low, no one asked about them. Daqian deeply appreciated his paintings and often added a few strokes to increase their value. Soon someone would buy them, and Mr. Yu benefited a lot from this, but it also shows that people value fame more than substance.

### Herding Geese Song

— Qu Weng

Eh, eh, willows sway and swallows fly low; Babies know what to do, long poles and wide hats call geese home.

Eh, eh, cranes sing as spring rises, reed shoots grow fat; Let the geese step on the waves, blue waves, red palms, snowy feathers.

Eh, eh, herding geese is good in the cool evening; People on the embankment clap their hands together, who is as clever as Xu's child.

My father raised geese, and once composed three "Herding Geese Songs," instructing Duo Ci to paint a picture, so I completed it to amuse my parents. The original words are recorded above. I was a guest in Xixi at that time, and my daughter was just one year old. Daughter-in-law Sun Duo Ci

### Mulberry

— Ci Yi

In the spring and autumn of Jiangnan, the girls' soft voices sing the mulberry-picking song:

Picking mulberry in the morning, picking mulberry in the evening,

I am busy with silkworms all day long,

I only hope that the silkworms grow quickly,

And spin two cocoons early, filling the basket.

In the evening, the setting sun dyes the horizon, and a misty haze rises in the fields; the endless mulberry fields are filled with green fragrance, and the endless mulberry fields reflect the red clouds in the sky; the evening breeze stirs the girls' hair, and the girls walk towards the fields with smiling faces.

The singing echoes the laughter, all falling into the evening breeze.

Rolling up their sleeves, they painstakingly pick the fat mulberry leaves from the branches. The fog is heavy, and the setting sun burns the remnants of the clouds. The girls hum as they carry their baskets, staggering on the way home, forgetting their fatigue in their joy.

Spring follows autumn, and many girls in Jiangnan grow up in the years of raising silkworms. They are familiar with the technology of raising silkworms, and they also know the benefits of raising silkworms for themselves. Although raising silkworms is a very busy job, except for screening, feeding, picking mulberry leaves, you have to go to bed early and get up early to pay attention to cold and warmth and safety. However, when they fill the basket with snowy white harvest, they feel comforted and happy.

The girls in Jiangnan love the warm and cool silkworm-raising seasons in March and September - who wouldn't love this peaceful, lush, and green mulberry field in Jiangnan water town?

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 88

— Ye Jingfeng

(This is not a myth or a miracle, but a technique in Chinese martial arts. At the same time, those who know the trick know that the dog's weakness is on the root of its ears. As long as the hand is heavy, agile, and the striking method is accurate, a hit on the spot can kill the dog immediately.)

As soon as the dog lay down, Tiger Brother pounced, grabbed the dog's hind legs and dragged it, then spun it around twice on the ground, and released his hand to throw the dog towards the stone wall outside. The dog was thrown more than ten feet high and flew towards the stone wall outside. There was a loud bang, probably falling into the stream. Just after throwing the dog away, Tiger Brother stepped forward again and picked up the legs of the Japanese soldier lying on the ground, probably wanting to do the same as throwing the dog. I quickly whispered to stop Tiger Brother.

Tiger Brother knew that I wanted to check the guy out, so he picked up the Japanese soldier's flashlight next to the body. I secured the pistol and sword, shot a glance at both ends of the road, and called Tiger Brother to be on guard. I took the flashlight and looked closely. I saw that the guy's body was lying on the ground half-sided and half-down, with his head twisted backwards, his teeth bared, looking very ferocious and terrifying! I knew that Tiger Brother had broken his neck. Judging from the situation, Tiger Brother probably was startled by my yelling, and after waking up, he slipped out from behind the tree, sneaked up on him from behind, and used a heavy hand to twist his head backwards. I turned his body over and pulled out his identification tag, which read Sasaki Genjiro, Private First Class.

We arranged this guy's body like a dog, and then walked north along the jungle. After passing the boundary of the fourth building, we re-entered the jungle. We originally planned to linger for a while to see what those guys in the barracks would do, but now that we had taken out the Sasaki Gen patrolman, I was afraid that something would happen soon. After just glancing at the situation, I didn't want to delay any longer, so I crossed the open space from the shadows, passed the fourth four-story building, and reached the back of the main building.

We found a dark corner and hid ourselves. Then we looked back at the rows of barracks. There were some figures walking in the front one or two rows. Except for the occasional laughter, interspersed with Japanese music and singing broadcast, there was no loud laughter or loud discussions. I secretly admired the Japanese army for being able to maintain good order even during free rest time!

To the north, it was dark and vast. When I asked Tiger Brother if there was anything special to pay attention to in this open space, Tiger Brother shook his head and said, "Probably the airfield that the old man mentioned," but there were no airfield buildings, only the ground was yellow and black, probably making anti-aircraft camouflage.

We slipped slightly west along this main building, and suddenly felt some vibrations under our feet. I lay on the ground and listened with my ear, and knew that there must be a giant machine nearby that was running. After a few more steps, I saw small square holes all along the base of the wall of this main fortress. Each hole was about a foot square in size. Just close to the hole, I felt a gust of underground heat rushing out, and I faintly heard the rhythmic sound of the motor running, but I didn't see any light. I thought this was probably the power generation room for the entire area. Looking up, down, left, and right, I didn't see a single power line. Was it because the soil in the north was dry that all the power lines were buried underground?

From here, I could see that the western open space and the eastern barracks area were stacked on top of each other like hills. I didn't know what they were. When I asked Tiger Brother, he shielded his eyes with his hand, like ordinary people shading the sunlight, and stared for a while, telling me, "There are some barrels in front, probably gunpowder; behind that small mountain-like thing, it's all coal. There are also many large and small trucks in front of those round barrels.

Tiger Brother probably didn't recognize gasoline barrels, so he guessed that those round barrels were all gunpowder. As I moved forward, I was thinking: We two people, in this forbidden area, can at most only delay for another half an hour: Because the highest morality of the Japanese devils is order; they have already lost a patrolman, and there is no reason not to be discovered. Once discovered, there will of course be a big commotion and a big search; at that time, we may not be able to hide.

### Thoughts

— Shao Fu

"Sitting in quiet reflection, think often of your faults; in idle talk, do not discuss the faults of others." Both of these are difficult to do. It shows that it is not easy to be a good person.

The social life of Shanghai people is really too complicated. To sit in quiet, to be calm, and for the surrounding environment to be quiet, how many people out of ten thousand can do it? Every day they are busy with firewood, rice, oil, salt, or cars and foreign houses, their minds full of calculations. How can they be calm? Even if you are spotless, the neighbor's family will either have popular songs coming from the radio or the sound of mahjong tiles clattering. How can they allow you to have a moment of peace?

If you cannot sit quietly, you cannot even talk about "reflection." Even if you reflect, you may not be able to reflect on your past faults. Therefore, we all live our lives in a daze, simply coping with today day by day. We rarely reflect on and improve our shortcomings in our life behaviors.

I often have a hypocritical idea. If everyone, before going to bed, sits on the bed and closes their eyes to meditate on their words and deeds for a day, they will naturally have many feelings. Regret, repentance, pain, and烦恼 will occupy the vast majority of these feelings, and their conscience will not be extinguished.

However, people whose heads are just a burden on their shoulders fall asleep as soon as they climb into bed. Should we envy these people?

### Magical Strange Events

— Ge Chunliang

...Translated from "Scientific Digest" October Issue...

Undoubtedly, the most magical strange event in the world is the secret of the so-called Indian rope trick. The reason is very simple—because perhaps the trick has never been performed.

The magician is assumed to be standing in an open space, completely surrounded by the audience. He takes out a rope and throws it into the air. If the trick is done correctly, the rope will hang there, hanging straight down.

A child assistant grabs the rope and climbs up until he reaches the top. The magician recites a spell, and the child disappears. After a while, the child's flesh falls from the sky piece by piece—the scene is indeed very miserable. The magician fearlessly collects the fragments of flesh and bones. After confirming that none are missing, he puts them in a sack, says another magic word, and the child walks out of the sack, lively and unharmed.

This story has been around for hundreds of years, and with time, it has also been evolving. It was in 1355 AD that China first recorded this event—the man who reported this event said that the encounter was very stimulating to him, and he felt that he had to drink after seeing it. (Translator's note: This story seems to be in Pu Songling's Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio. Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio was produced in the early Qing Dynasty, about three hundred years ago, so the so-called 1355 AD and the words about having to drink are probably a misunderstanding of foreigners.) Two hundred years later, the event caused a sensation in Germany. Finally, it returned to its old home, India. As a result, everyone knew about the thing called the Indian rope trick.

Has this trick ever been accurately investigated? Yes. The Magical Committee of the Magic Circle decided to conduct a thorough on-site investigation. It was a long-distance job, and investigators were sent to India to inquire about the three thousand spectators who had seen the event.

Many people claimed to know the secret of this matter. One woman said that it was using a long, thin cloth bag, pretending to be a rope. Next to the bag, there was a transforming switch, and a very long stick was stuffed into the bag, so the rope seemed to be hanging straight in the air. However, she did not say where the child disappeared—like many others.

Someone said that he completely hypnotized the crowd; however, hypnosis experts said that it was impossible, and a group of spectators would not all be hypnotized. Someone else said that he saw the trick, but it was on a narrow street with corridors on both sides of the houses. The magician used fuel to create a layer of smoke in the air, so it was impossible to see the top of the rope. However, this situation does not meet the stated rules.

Another man said that he saw the trick, but he was late, and the rope had already been hanging in the air.

Several Indian army officers offered a high reward, as long as anyone would come out to perform it. But the reward money remained untouched. Therefore, the secret of this magical strange event is also preserved—it has never been revealed. The conclusion is: This thing definitely never happened.

### Street Signs

In the era of the former concessions, street signs were all cast in iron, which was strong and durable and not easily soiled. The enemy and puppets changed the street names and began to use wooden signs, probably because iron was not easy to obtain, and even the old signs were bundled up and taken away. The handwriting was from the same hand, in Yan style. After the victory, the characters were in a new art style, which was very elegant. However, wooden signs are easy to decay, and mischievous children like to play with them, and they are easily painted over. This is their shortcoming.

### Jews and Shanghai

— Shi Jing

Jews have only been coming to China in large numbers for five or six years, but they have already caused a generally negative feeling among Chinese people. This is because they lack the concept of nationality, and reality has forged them into selfish, ruthless, and profit-seeking individuals. Every morning, except for the elderly women managing household affairs, there are almost no Jews staying home. Every Jew carries a briefcase and a rattan basket, leaving home for the heart of the metropolis (Shanghai). Besides selling small miscellaneous goods and large pieces of woolen fabrics, they also engage in arbitrage and scalping in Shanghai's banks and financial districts, sparing no effort in dealing with small-value stocks.

After becoming rich, most Chinese people have a mindset of seeking good fortune by chance, while shrewd Jews have absolute persistence in their greed. They can subsist on two pieces of bread for three meals a day, and they also rush to return home after obtaining a small profit. Over time, this has strengthened their economic power. When Chinese tycoons gain economic strength, they become afraid to take risks, while Jews become even more resourceful. About four or five years ago, Shanghai began the most egregious form of hoarding in human history. At that time, Western medicines were bought up in large quantities, woolens became rare commodities, canned foods were completely cleaned out, all materials were manipulated, and the price increases could not be suppressed. Later, it became clear that Jews had exerted their full effort in indirect maneuvers during this process.

After establishing a foothold in Shanghai, the Jews became even more skilled and persistent. They also turned their attention to real estate. The former Avenue Joffre (霞飛路) was their starting point, and gradually Hongkou was hoarded to resemble their homeland. A shop that used to be bought for tens of thousands of yuan (puppet currency) now cannot be sold for anything less than millions of legal tender (法幣). This has built an even stronger fortress for the Jews' economic power. However, in order to digest the fruits they have swallowed, they must make remote areas flourish like lightning. The desolate eastern areas have risen as they wished, and then they sell high and buy low. The Jews launched a total attack on Shanghai's economic lifeline, hoarding large quantities of food and collecting as much folk food as possible. On the one hand, they opened food stores as a cover, and on the other hand, they strengthened their manipulation. Many have become miraculously wealthy in Shanghai.

The most shameful thing in social and commercial ethics today is "product imitation." Famous products are often imitated and sold on the market. But the Jews do not just imitate; they simply plagiarize. They manufacture exactly the same famous perfumes, American cigarettes, daily necessities, etc., and desperately inflate their value to sell them in a mixed manner. The goods sold in the market are naturally of the lowest quality, but they still rely on low prices as a selling point, forming something that the public is happy to buy.

The Jews' "competent and pleasant" display of talent in Shanghai is undoubtedly a significant threat to the economy of the Chinese people in Shanghai. How to suppress prices is a concern for the authorities, and how to monitor the activities of the Jews should also be an urgent task!

Fable

### God, Power, and Justice

— Gu Dong

Once, Power and Justice met in God's palace. God said, "I used you to govern the people of the world. Now, tell me about your past achievements."

So, Justice, with weary steps, pleaded:

"God, I received your holy decree and descended to earth, spreading your gospel to the world. I gave slaves rest, I gave beggars relief, cats no longer fear dogs, wolves no longer bully rabbits, humanity was freed from war, animals were liberated, I filled the earth with vigor and the universe with joy. But, God! Unexpectedly, not long after, the slaves became sick, the cats and dogs rebelled, the wolves chased the rabbits, and people were forced to go to war again. Yet, joy appeared on their faces instead. Isn't this justice being resisted?"

Power then sneered and said:

"Heh... I took over Justice's job. I made people war, I made wolves eat rabbits, cats fear dogs, and dogs fear tigers. I also made slaves work and let them eat whips. Alas! God, when I arrived, the earth was peaceful, but the slaves frowned and the rabbits dozed off. After I left, the mean-spirited slaves willingly ate the whips, and the wealthy merchants opened their mouths wide and laughed. The weak are meat for the strong, and this has become the justice of the human world! Look at the world I govern, although dark and cruel, it suits everyone's intentions."

Power retreated from the palace, and Justice waited for God's final judgment.

God said, "Alas! What can I say? Isn't Power a hundred times better than you? Go, the human world does not need justice!"

Weekly Chat "I Want to Get Married" Resonates

Editor's Note: After this publication carried an article entitled "I Want to Get Married" three days ago, it aroused resonance among many young men and women. At present, everything is dominated by economic factors. I don't know how many young men and women spend their youth in vain. Men dare not marry, and women do not easily marry. "The Problem of Old Maids" is indeed worth discussing. The few letters published here all come from frank and sincere young people. We treat this matter as a youth problem, not to cater to the tastes of young people. Therefore, although the topic is eye-catching, the content is quite serious!

### I Also Want to Get Married

— Juan

Reading the article "I Want to Get Married" moved me very much. I and Miss Ren are truly in the same boat. I am even more afraid of becoming an "old maid," and I believe I am more anxious than Miss Ren because I am older than her. I have already graduated from university for five years and have been an "old maid" who has been working for five years. Although half of my life has passed, I can't just casually end the remaining half. However, my parents cannot support me for a lifetime, and a career cannot be a lifelong pursuit. Especially in this sluggish economy, small clerks are likely to be laid off at any time. In the current society, where women's careers are still seen as "vases," who wants you in a commercial organization when you are older, except for teachers and nurses?

I want to get married! I don't want to add the burden of my life to my husband. I have a bachelor's degree in English, I can translate, and I can type. I can help my husband do all the work in the office. I want to get married so that I can have spiritual comfort, rely on someone when I am old, and fulfill my parents' wishes. I want to avoid being ridiculed by relatives and friends as an "old maid" who will never get married!

### Want to Marry but Afraid to Marry

— Min

Of course, I also want to get married, but in the current era of "great poverty" and "great chaos," if a couple does not have the economic capacity of an ordinary family and cannot cultivate our next generation to be better and stronger than us, then what happiness is there in getting married? In this era, most men who are of good character and high morals are very poor. It is not that I am afraid that they cannot give me enjoyment, but a minimum standard of living must be maintained. This is why many young ladies become old maids, and many young ladies want to marry but are afraid to marry. I once said, "In this era, one must have the determination to sacrifice in order to get married." However, I can sacrifice myself, but I cannot sacrifice our next generation. The knowledge, health, and personality of our children cannot but rely on sufficient economic power.

Therefore, I want to marry but I am afraid to marry.

### Know Yourself and Know Your Enemy

— Zhe

"I Want to Get Married" is a title that is so eye-catching, and here, I cannot but admire the author's boldness in saying what people are unwilling to say. Although the civilization of the present society has reached its peak, how many people, especially women, throughout the thousands of years of history, have been willing to express the hidden pain in their hearts so frankly! This time, the author has finally broken through the inner suffering of many female compatriots who hope to marry but have not yet found a partner, which is such a gratifying thing.

"Getting married" is not a way out. I believe that a woman's desire to get married is no different from a man's desire to marry. This is purely based on the physiological, psychological, and overall living requirements of each other. The so-called "gentleman's value begins with husband and wife" also illustrates the inevitability of marriage. I extremely oppose bachelorhood and let youth pass away in vain. As for how to solve the "I Want to Get Married!" proposed by Miss Ren, this is not only her own eager hope, but probably all women with such a situation want society to give them a definite indication. I think finding a partner is not too difficult, as long as you do not have prejudice and can know yourself and know your enemy, you can win every battle. We see that the reason why general women go down the road of "old maids" is mostly because they overestimate themselves and end up neither high nor low.

This is an old tune, but it is a common situation.

### The Beginning of Life

— Hui Biao

"When a man is old, he should marry; when a woman is old, she should be married." Love is a need in life. Dupuy said, "Marriage is an episode in a man's life, but it is the beginning of a woman's life."

However, in the current Chinese society, the marriage system is still in a stage of transition between the old and the new. It is difficult to handle men's marriage and women's marriage. I hope there will be proper and appropriate ways for society to organize marriage introductions.
