### Third Party Proposes New Suggestions; Main Content Focuses on Ceasefire; Publicity Regarding Truce Awaits Negotiation

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Days of informal discussions have gradually become concrete. Third party figures, from the evening of the 25th to noon on the 26th, have been conducting individual visits. Chen Cheng, Wu Dingchang, Shao Lizi, Lei Zhen and other prominent figures have been approached separately to conduct detailed discussions on ceasefire and various political issues. At 3 PM, another meeting was held at the Bank of Communications. First, each representative reported the results of their respective visits and integrated them for further study. Subsequently, the new suggestions of the third party were presented for discussion. As a result, it was deemed that the suggestions could be established. According to Luo Longji of the China Democratic League, these suggestions are a plan for a ceasefire. The section regarding point, line and surface mentioned in the Evening Post today has not been confirmed by any party. It is reported that the content of the plan is very detailed regarding the stationing of troops after reorganization, and both sides’ opinions have been taken into consideration. In addition to the ceasefire as the main content, it also touches upon the reorganization of the National Government, the reorganization of the Executive Yuan, and the draft constitution. However, currently, all parties have agreed to publicize the truce, so none are willing to disclose its contents. The third party’s meeting ended at around 6 PM today. They plan to hold another informal meeting with government representatives on the 27th, at which they will submit the suggestions decided on the 26th for discussion, and await the Chairman's return to the capital to seek instructions. At the same time, they will meet with Communist Party representatives to listen to their opinions. The development will depend on the expressions of the highest authorities on both sides within a day or two. A meeting was held at Sun Ke's residence at 6 PM on the 26th, attended by eleven people including representatives of the Political Consultative Conference, the government, Chen Cheng, Wu Dingchang, and Chen Bulei. Peng Xuepei and Shao Lizi reported on the proceedings of last night’s talks on publicizing the truce, which was then discussed until around 8 PM.

[Our Newspaper, Beijing, 26th] Concrete measures for "publicizing the truce" were finalized last night and are divided into three points. It is reported that the content could not be announced on the 26th because instructions from Yan'an and the government have not yet arrived. Government representative Sun Ke told reporters tonight that he agreed with the principles of these measures, but the technical aspects still need to be studied, and it is necessary to see what the Communist Party's opinion is first. As for the CCP's opinion, Li Weihan telephoned Luo Longji of the China Democratic League at 2 PM to inform him that they had already agreed to two of the points and are currently seeking instructions from the Yan'an authorities.

### Zhou Enlai Visits Marshal; US Mediator Quietly Awaits Publication of New Suggestions

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The American mediator is currently quietly awaiting the publication of the third party's new suggestions so that negotiations can officially begin. Ambassador Stuart was unable to contact the outside world this morning due to illness. Only Zhou Enlai visited Marshal at 11:30 AM for talks. Afterwards, according to the spokesman of the CCP delegation, it was just a normal visit, and there was nothing to report.

[United Press, Nanjing, 26th] CCP representative Zhou Enlai met with Special Envoy Marshall for more than three hours on the 26th. Observers here generally believe that Zhou's visit to Marshal reflects that the third party's mediation for peace has not achieved much. Although the situation seems to have made no progress, according to Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke, he does not feel pessimistic at all. Chairman Chiang did not return to Beijing on the scheduled time on the 26th, resulting in the suspension of the agreement to stop the propaganda war and failure to sign immediately.

### Remarks by President Sun

Reorganization of National Government and Executive Yuan is practically impossible.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Sun Ke answered questions from our reporter regarding the latest developments in the current situation on the evening of the 26th, as follows: Q: There are rumors that the CCP insists on reorganizing the Executive Yuan. What is the government's attitude? A: This matter has already been resolved by the Political Consultative Conference. Reorganizing the National Government Committee and reorganizing the Executive Yuan are both a matter of time. At the same time, simultaneous reorganization seems impossible, because the National Government Committee is like a mother, and the Executive Yuan is its son. If the National Government Committee is not completely reorganized, how can the Executive Yuan be reorganized? Without a mother, where does the son come from? If time permits, it should be completed before the National Assembly. Q: Must the draft constitution be passed by the Legislative Yuan? A: The May 5th Draft Constitution was passed by the Legislative Yuan. This amendment should also go through the legislative procedure of the Legislative Yuan. However, the drafting and review committee has not yet been held, the amendment has not yet been completely drafted, and the convening of the Constitutional Review Committee is pending the issuance of a ceasefire order. After various meetings are held, it can be held. Q: There are rumors that President Sun will concurrently serve as the head of the Executive Yuan. Is there such a thing? A: There is no such thing.

There is a possibility that Andong Prefecture will be occupied by them, but before confirmation from the Northeast Front and Yan'an, I will not comment on the possible consequences of this matter for the time being. (2) The Yantai battlefield, where the government navy and the army that is advancing north from Laiyang have been attacking since the 23rd, proving that the US request for foreigners there to evacuate on the 16th and 29th is related to this. It is estimated that serious consequences will occur at the end of the month. (3) The Northern Jiangsu battlefield, where Dongtai has been in fierce fighting for nearly a month, and the northern front is in fierce fighting in the Shuyang and Lianshui areas. (4) The Pinghan battlefield, where the National Army is trying to open up the Pinghan line, starting from Beiping in the north and ending in Anyang in the south.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 26th] The Communist Party spokesman in Beiping issued a written statement today, stating again: "The government must fulfill the ceasefire agreement of January 10 and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference before there can be true peace." The spokesman also criticized the National Army for attacking Andong and Tonghua in southern Manchuria, Yantai in Shandong, and Lianshui in northern Jiangsu, and regarded this as a smokescreen for peace. Previously, a certain newspaper here published a news item stating that "the atmosphere of peace in Yan'an is strong," which was met with dissatisfaction from the Communist Party spokesman here. Now, a certain newspaper says that "the Communist Party spokesman in Beiping said: Although the atmosphere of peace is very strong, peace talks will definitely have no end." This written statement was issued in response to the above two news items.

During Zheng Chenggong's reign, this place was already the most prosperous commercial area. The port is surrounded by mountains, with only one side facing north, hence the old name "Chicken Cage." Because of its strategic nature, the port was subjected to 25 air raids during the war, and 70% of the city was destroyed by bombing.

[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang on the 26th by Our Newspaper] The Nationalist troops, having arrived in the outskirts of East Tai city, launched a siege and counterattack this morning.

Furthermore, over a thousand Communist troops attacked Zhangdian, southeast of Taixian, on the 25th. After a day and night of intense fighting, the Communist troops were finally routed.

[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang on the 26th by Our Newspaper] According to military figures who recently arrived in the province from Shiyan, a recovered area in northern Jiangsu, the Nationalist troops advancing towards East Tai from the southeast are approaching the city in a fan-shaped formation, rather than adopting an encirclement tactic. This clearly leaves an opening on one side, intending to allow the Communist troops to retreat towards southern Shandong along the Fan Gong Dike. Currently, the waterway between Xinghua and East Tai leading to Yancheng is almost completely blocked by the large and small boats used by the Communist troops to transport supplies, numbering over a thousand. It is also reported that some of these civilian boats have been impounded by the Communist troops for more than two years.

[Special Dispatch from Taixian on the 25th by Our Newspaper] On the morning of the 25th, the headquarters of a certain division had already moved to Liangdui.

Through special binocular telescopes, the Wen Temple and a pagoda in the southeastern corner of the East Tai urban area could be seen very clearly. Liangdui is located 18 li (Chinese miles) from East Tai. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, the recovery of East Tai will not have to wait until the end of this month.

[Special Dispatch from Taixian on the 25th by Our Newspaper] This reporter arrived at Liangdui, which had just been recovered this morning, with the army at noon on the 25th. The residents have long suffered from the harsh rule of the Communist troops and regard the Nationalist army vehicles as saviors, doing their utmost to assist them. All Communist troops are currently retreating towards the Sanzhao area, and the Nationalist troops are advancing in search, having already crossed Sanlidian.

[Special Dispatch from Taixian on the 25th by Our Newspaper] This reporter traveled from the frontline at Liangdui along the Tongyu Highway to Haian at noon on the 25th. Military vehicles traveled endlessly along the road, and the rising dust fully demonstrated the tension of the wartime situation.

[Special Dispatch from Yangzhou on the 26th by Our Newspaper] It is reported that the military has completed deployments in the important areas of various townships and districts in the recovered areas along the Grand Canal. Pacification will be implemented starting next month, and the Ministry of National Defense plans to send key personnel to the pacification zones to inspect and supervise. It is also learned that although the Nationalist troops and the county governments have made arrests upon entering the recovered areas, no one has been killed except on the battlefield. Therefore, the people who were coerced are all coming forward to the government to turn themselves in.

### Liaoning Delegates to the National Federation of Commerce Talk About the Current State of Industry and Commerce in the Northeast

Takeover Work Too Slow, Major Factories Unable to Start Production, Worries About Future Crisis When Foreign Goods Flood In

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing on the 26th by Our Newspaper] Li Zaofang, a Liaoning delegate to the National Federation of Commerce who came to Nanjing, told a reporter on the 26th: "If we want China to become rich and powerful, there is no other way than to build a new Northeast. If the Northeast prospers, the establishment of a new China can be expected soon. The Northeast is rich in resources, and its industry and commerce have already established a foundation in recent years. The price we have paid to transform it is indeed great, but the Northeast has a truly great potential in the future." According to him, there are a total of twenty-one delegates from the Northeast attending this National Federation of Commerce meeting, representing five provinces. In the past fourteen years, the Northeast has been isolated from everything in the motherland due to oppression by the enemy and puppet regimes. They are also not very familiar with the government's economic policies and measures, as well as the domestic industrial and commercial situation. They plan to take this opportunity to have more contact with industrial and commercial leaders from all over the country, and also plan to meet with heads of ministries to request instructions and to express the grievances of their fellow countrymen in the Northeast. After the meeting, they also plan to go to Shanghai to gain a better understanding of the economic capital.

Li continued to talk about the current state of industry and commerce in the Northeast, saying: "After the enemy surrendered, they left behind an excellent industrial and commercial foundation in the Northeast, which is a great boon for both the local and national levels. Our fellow countrymen in the Northeast also have great hopes for the future of industry and commerce in the Northeast. Unexpectedly, all kinds of unfortunate events occurred after the victory, causing the entire territory to be scarred and everything to be waiting to be rebuilt. At the same time, the takeover work was also too slow, causing most of the major factories to be unable to start production. If this continues, when foreign goods flood in in the future, it may be impossible to rebuild the industry in the Northeast. This is what our fellow countrymen in the Northeast are most anxious about and hope the government will handle as soon as possible." When talking about the difficulties faced by industry and commerce in the Northeast, Li said, "What we currently feel is most difficult is the inconvenience of transportation. Materials cannot flow smoothly, so raw materials cannot be transported in, and finished products cannot be exported, causing industry and commerce to fall into a state of paralysis. For example, the current price of rice in Shenyang is 27 yuan per catty (a Chinese unit of weight, approximately 500g), while in Jilin it is only 4 or 5 yuan per catty. Due to the inconvenience of transportation, rice from Jilin cannot be transported to relieve Shenyang." Another difficulty is the lack of power. Electricity has been damaged, and coal also cannot be transported in, so less than one in a hundred factories in Shenyang are operating. In addition, what hinders the development of industry and commerce in the Northeast is the currency system. Due to the problems with the circulating notes, the value of the currency is falling daily, and prices are rising daily. For example, rice was only sold for 3.5 yuan per catty in February of this year, but today it is already sold for 80 yuan per catty, a dozens-fold increase. Some of the red banknotes have been recovered, and counterfeit ones are also occasionally appearing. Currently, the main export from the Northeast is soybeans, while the main import from within the country is cotton yarn." Li said at the end: "The Northeast does not lack skilled workers. On the contrary, there are many unemployed workers because factories cannot start production. The Northeast urgently needs funds, and we hope that this issue can get the assistance of all parties."

### Police Officer Kills Street Vendor by Kicking Him, Major Disturbance Erupts in Hong Kong, Angry Mob Clashes with Military and Police for Seven Hours

[United Press, Hong Kong, 26th] The most violent disturbance since 1925 occurred here today.

The crowds attacked the car carrying Police Commissioner Samson when he arrived at the scene to direct the police, who used fire hoses to spray the crowds.

A vehicle passing through the area at the time had Chinese passengers who witnessed this scene and immediately informed the crowd, leading to the outbreak of the conflict.

[Special Dispatch from Kaifeng on the 26th by Our Newspaper] The Jiaozuo Coal Mine Power Plant was restored on the 20th, and both water and electricity came, bringing great light.

[Central News Agency, Manila, 25th] This agency has exclusively learned that Ambassador Chen Zhiping, after formally taking office, discussed three nationalization bills that discriminate against Overseas Chinese with Philippine Vice President Quirino for the first time today. Chen protested against the nationalization of market stalls, a bill signed by President Roxas on October 1st, which stipulates that only Filipinos are allowed to operate stalls. This is tantamount to preventing Overseas Chinese from engaging in this business. Chen strongly stated that if this is put into action, it will be detrimental to the relationship between China and the Philippines. It is also learned that Chen has advised that during this time when China and the Philippines are negotiating a general treaty of friendship, could these bills be delayed? The other two nationalization bills, concerning retailers and laborers, are still under discussion. Only by applying fair principles can a permanent solution to these problems be hoped for.

### Jiang Ercuo, Who Lacked Promise, Retried; Traitor Zhou Fohai Summoned to Court to Testify; Trial Concluded, Sentencing Set for November 2nd

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing on the 26th by Our Newspaper] Traitor Jiang Ercuo, the former president of the puppet Examination Yuan, was retried at 10:50 AM on the 26th in the Dacheng Hall. After Judge Jin Shiding, Judges Wang Hongquan and Liu Xiancai, and Prosecutor Chen Shengzu took their seats, the sixty-four-year-old traitor Jiang was brought to court. He was wearing an old gray serge jacket, black cloth shoes, and was completely disheveled. His hair was gray, he was hunchbacked, and he was short-sighted. When answering questions, after reciting his lengthy academic qualifications, experiences, and writings, he began to elaborate on his traitorous views. He admitted that he had published a declaration in the Zhonghua Daily in the autumn of the 28th year of the Republic (1939) when the puppet government returned to its capital, responding to peace. However, when it came to joining the puppet government, he falsely claimed that he "usually admired Wang (Jingwei) and mistakenly believed that what he called peace talks was a tacit agreement with the central government, so he also joined, just like 'If I don't go to hell, who will?' He followed Mencius' ancient teaching that 'the people are the most important, and the state comes next,' to reduce the suffering of the people in the occupied areas. This is just like in the history of the Song and Ming dynasties, those who were able to sacrifice themselves to protect the nation's culture and the country's vitality could eventually be restored." Traitor Jiang was cunning and evasive, always avoiding the important points and making absurd arguments during the court's questioning. Then, traitor Zhou Fohai was summoned to court to testify. Zhou testified that Jiang's appointment to a puppet position was recommended by Japanese Navy Admiral Suga. Jiang firmly denied this, saying that he knew Suga through Wang Jingwei. Each held to their own version of events. Later, the prosecutor debated with Jiang and his defense lawyers, Ge Cheng. At 1:30 PM, the court adjourned the trial and set the sentencing for November 2nd.

### Traitor Pan Yugui's Trial Concluded

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing on the 26th by Our Newspaper] The Capital High Court opened a court at 3:00 PM on the 26th, with Judge Ge Zhitan and Judges Ge Zhaotang and Yang Yutian retrying puppet Tianjin Mayor Pan Yugui. Traitor Pan wore a black jacket, looked haggard, with thoughts filling his forehead. He was accompanied to court by his youngest son, Pan Ming. He spoke about serving the country and the people, often feigning deafness and dumbness. He found it difficult to refute the sharp questions from the presiding judge, Ge, and at times was vague and evasive. The court inquired about his actions during his various puppet positions, such as burning national language textbooks, arresting central agents, and forcibly conscripting civilian land, laborers, and food to support the enemy. After questioning, the debate began. Prosecutor Wang Wenjun listed other criminal facts and the reasons for the prosecution. Then, Pan and his defense lawyers, Ye Zaihang and Yang Jialin, successively defended. At 5:30 PM, the court adjourned the trial and set the sentencing for November 1st.

Editorial

### The Crux of US-Soviet Relations

Pearl Harbor, United Press Agency, 24th dispatch: US Pacific Fleet Deputy Commander Vice Admiral McCormick is currently touring the Pacific and China to inspect military bases. The day before yesterday, he told the press in Pearl Harbor: "The United States must maintain a strong network of bases in the Pacific to defend against atomic bombs and other new types of weapons. The best defense for the United States is to keep any future enemy from the West at a distance. This would prevent a 'Pearl Harbor incident' from happening again in the future." From this brief statement, it can be seen that the United States' vigilance in the Pacific has never slackened. Although the goal of the US's adoption of this policy is to maintain peace and security, it ultimately gives the world the impression of a posture of preparedness for war. Especially in the eyes of sensitive countries, it is an even more serious threat.

In recent days, because the United Nations General Assembly opened in New York, representatives of 51 countries gathered on the shores of Lake Success. Everyone has great expectations for the success of the United Nations General Assembly. President Truman has formally stated that the United States will use all its resources to support the United Nations organization. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov also stated that the Soviet Union will make contributions to the United Nations General Assembly to enable it to complete its mission. At the same time, he hinted that if the United States and the Soviet Union act with sincerity and goodwill, they will be able to reach a mutual understanding and all difficulties can be easily resolved. In theory, US-Soviet relations are expected to improve, and all the haze between the two countries will not be difficult to sweep away. However, on the one hand, some countries at the United Nations General Assembly are demanding the withdrawal of the veto power, and on the other hand, the Soviet Union is demanding that the General Assembly Secretariat delete the cases related to the discussion of the abolition of the veto power from the agenda. Both sides are tending to extremes, and even the Cuban representative is striving for it with resignation, and the Soviet Union is unwilling to show weakness, almost leading to a stalemate. The United Nations General Assembly encountered a major difficulty shortly after its opening. This is also sufficient to illustrate that it is not an easy task to demand that the United States and the Soviet Union resolve their suspicions, make peace, and work together to support the United Nations organization in maintaining world peace.

The above two news reports, one is that the United States wants to maintain strong military bases in the Pacific, and the other is that the Soviet Union is determined not to give up its veto power. On the surface, they are two unrelated things, but in reality, they have a very close relationship. May I ask why the United States wants to maintain bases in the Pacific? May I ask why the Soviet Union wants to abuse its veto power? Obviously, it is due to the mutual suspicion and mutual defense between the United States and the Soviet Union, and their unwillingness to trust and tolerate each other, to seek peace in cooperation, and to seek security in peace. No matter how beautifully the political diplomats of the United States and the Soviet Union say and advocate US-Soviet cooperation, both sides have their own strengths and seek only their own security, regardless of the life and death of others. For example, for its own security, the United States wants to maintain strong bases in the Pacific and elsewhere, regardless of whether the Soviet Union feels threatened. Similarly, for its own security, and to prevent others from besieging it, the Soviet Union also wants to expand its security zone, regardless of how the United States feels. But we must further ask: Why do the United States and the Soviet Union want to do this? The political diplomats of the United States and the Soviet Union are not without far-sighted people. Of course, they also understand that US-Soviet cooperation is not only a blessing for the world, but also beneficial to both sides themselves. Conversely, US-Soviet separation and going their separate ways is not only a catastrophe for mankind, but also a disaster for the two countries. Knowing it and doing it anyway, how can this be explained?

These incomprehensible riddles have recently also aroused debate between the pens of the United States and the Soviet Union. First of all, the Soviet Union's "New Times" magazine published an article attacking the domestic and foreign policies of the United States, expressing great doubts about the United States' search for bases around the world. The Soviet political commentator Zaikin asked in a suspicious tone: "Since the complete defeat of Germany and Japan, why does the United States still need to frantically search for bases in every corner of the world? Who do they need so many bases to oppose?" American reader Pan Jinzi immediately wrote a letter to answer from the standpoint of the American people. He said: "Isn't your Soviet Union also expanding its borders like our United States, making its surrounding neighbors 'friendly countries'? The US government is preventing World War III, just as France immediately began to build the Maginot Line after World War I. So the US government, like the Soviet government, does not believe that peace can be ensured solely by intangible principles such as friendship and morality." After reading the American reader's reply, Dai Qin was still unconvinced and wrote another article published in "New Times" to defend himself again. He said that several questions about diplomacy are closely related. Since the end of the war, the reactionary forces of Britain and the United States have expanded. They are unwilling to cooperate with the Soviet Union and other democratic countries, but only attempt to make them submit. They deliberately organized the Anglo-American group to expand its power to the world. Even the American people say loudly that after World War II, mankind has entered the 'American Century'."

In this pen war, everyone has their own reasons, and each can justify himself. After reading it, we only feel that we have fallen into a fog of confusion, and are even more confused about the fundamental contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union. But generally speaking, it can be observed from two aspects: one is the conflict of ideas, and the other is the conflict of interests. Ideologically, the Soviet Union is a socialist Soviet country, and the United States is a capitalist democratic country. Although both claim to be democratic countries, they are two completely different democracies. From the Soviet perspective, only the Soviet system is true democracy. For example, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov gave a speech at the Paris Peace Conference, openly attacking British and American-style democracy as 19th-century democracy, and claiming that Soviet democracy is 20th-century democracy. In the British and American view, the current Soviet system still belongs to the political system of an omnipotent country, not true democracy. Professor Fei Fei, an expert on Far Eastern issues in the United States, came to China to lecture and frankly criticized the Soviet Union's democratic politics, saying: "The Soviet Union's economic methods are commendable; if she gives the people the freedom to vote, then I would also be willing to join the Communist Party." This struggle between the two democracies is the ideological conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, in the current international arena, realism is all the rage, and ideological conflicts may not hinder international cooperation. On the eve of the outbreak of World War II, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, which were sworn enemies, also turned enemies into friends and signed a non-aggression treaty. The joys and sorrows of the international community have nothing to do with ideology, and the real key lies in interests. Therefore, Professor Fei Fei also said: "Ideology is not a big relationship, the main thing is international interests. So it often goes wrong."

Judging from the current situation, the highest interest of the Soviet Union is peace and security; the highest interest of the United States is also peace and security; it is just that the peace and security required by the two countries are different. In the Soviet Union's view, after this war, it has gained a bloody lesson. What it needs most now is peace, to build a socialist country in an atmosphere of peace; secondly, it also needs security, to not worry about being besieged by other countries. But if the Soviet Union does not come out to lead world peace, it will never be truly reliable and permanent peace; and if there is no large security zone around the Soviet Union, then the Soviet Union will never be able to rest easy. This is the Soviet Union's perspective on interests. On the American side, in order to achieve world peace, it does not hesitate to make significant sacrifices and resolutely participated in this war. After three or four years of hard fighting, it was finally able to achieve a slow victory, but after the pain, the only goal of the United States in the future is to maintain world peace and avoid the recurrence of war. However, the growing strength of the Soviet Union, whether for Europe or for the Far East, is ultimately felt to be a serious threat, and it is necessary to prepare for the future and prevent problems before they occur. Although the United States is very willing to cooperate with the Soviet Union, it cannot help but be wary of its strength. Why is the United States unwilling to disclose the secrets of atomic energy publicly, and must the Soviet Union first announce its political and economic demands on the world? This is entirely due to the United States' inability to rest assured, and its suspicion of the Soviet Union. Therefore, they become the cause and effect of each other, which has created an increasingly tense situation between the United States and the Soviet Union. Although US Secretary of State Byrnes said that the American people have extended a hand of friendship to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union is still apprehensive and dare not extend its hand. Therefore, US-Soviet relations have not improved so far. This is the crux of US-Soviet relations.

In short, the center of gravity of today's world is entirely on US-Soviet relations. Mankind is looking forward to peace and urgently expects the improvement of US-Soviet relations, just like a severe drought hoping for timely rain. The political diplomats of the two countries, who bear a historical mission, should focus on the crux of US-Soviet relations, and then use their great wisdom and courage to transform hostility into peace between the United States and the Soviet Union, and at least restore the spirit of wartime cooperation to jointly create world peace. This United Nations General Assembly is an excellent opportunity to serve as a starting point for the improvement of US-Soviet relations. We hope that the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries can cherish this valuable opportunity. During this period, there should be less inappropriate remarks to avoid stimulating each other's emotions.

### The People in the Recovered Areas of Northern Jiangsu are Suffering / The Provincial Government Requests Exemption from Land Tax / Military and Civilians Cooperate to Rush to Repair the Highway Along the Canal

[Our newspaper Zhenjiang dispatch] Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Wang stated that the counties in northern Jiangsu have been occupied for eight years, and the enemy and puppets have collected food and taxes, and plundered in every possible way. The people are almost destitute, and the countryside is bankrupt. Last year, the central government exempted taxes, but northern Jiangsu, which is in dire straits, did not receive any real benefits. At present, the collection of land tax is very difficult. Yesterday, he specially requested the central government to sympathize with the people's difficulties and approve the exemption of land tax in the newly recovered areas of northern Jiangsu for 1946 to show compassion.

[Our newspaper Zhenjiang dispatch] According to Zhang Jingcheng, director of the Jiangsu Provincial Highway Bureau, the current situation of rushing to repair the highways north and south of the Yangtze River is as follows: In northern Jiangsu, after Shaobo, Gaobao, and Huai'an were successively recovered, the Construction Department and the Bureau separately rushed to repair the main highways in the counties in order to cooperate with military needs. As of now, the Shaobo Daji Bridge started construction in September and was fully completed on the 17th. The bridge is extremely important on the canal line. Now, with the cooperation of the military and civilians, the highway along the canal from Yangzhou to Gaoyou Baoying has been repaired and opened to traffic, and the road surface is being reinforced. The highway from Baoying to Huaiyin is currently being repaired. Once completed, the Bureau plans to operate regular passenger and freight vehicles. The highway between Fengpei Xiao and other counties near Xuzhou and Huaiyin is currently being planned for repair. In southern Jiangsu, the highway from Zhenjiang to Jurong is being reinforced with the roadbed and bridges are being built. The highways from Zhenjiang to Wujin, Wujin to Jiangyin, Wuxi to Shanghai, and Changshu to Fushan are currently being actively planned for repair in addition to finding ways to improve the road surface.

[Taixian dispatch] Jiangyan, Qutang, Baimi, Hai'an, and Huangqiao in Taixing, which belong to Taizhou in northern Jiangsu, have been recovered by the national army. However, the people have suffered severely from the disaster and urgently need relief. It is reported that the Suning Branch of the Executive Yuan has decided to allocate 50 tons of flour to Jiangyan, Qutang, and Hai'an respectively, 20 tons of Baimi, and 100 tons of Huangqiao, and has sent inspector Yu Pu to investigate and release emergency relief.

### Provincial-Level Financial Difficulties Disappear / This Month's Expenses Are Not Enough / There Will Be No Money Next Month / The Director of the Finance Department Goes to Beijing Again to Ask for Instructions

[Our newspaper Hangzhou 26th dispatch] Zhejiang's provincial-level finances have reached the extreme of difficulty. Even official salaries have to be patched together to cope with the situation. Our newspaper's reporter specially visited the person in charge of the provincial government to ask about the reasons. According to his analysis: (1) Although the revenue and expenditure system was reformed in July, the Ministry of Finance delayed the transfer of business tax to the provincial government for management until October. From July to September, the province only collected 200 million yuan, which has not yet been transferred to the Finance Department. (2) The Ministry of Grain approved the case of collecting land tax at a 50% discount too slowly, and it only started to be collected recently. (3) The Provincial Government's revenue and expenditure comparison table for the second half of the year has not yet been approved by the Executive Yuan. According to unofficial news, the Executive Yuan has revised it to balance revenue and expenditure. It is not known which items have been deleted, but in fact, there is no way to recover the expenses from July to October. (4) The central government originally decided to include the revenue from land tax in kind at 10,000 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure) of grain into the provincial budget, and the excess revenue from sales would be used to adjust the treatment of civil servants. Recently, it was heard that the central government changed it to 13,000 yuan, the price difference was reduced, and the source of adjustment was exhausted. (5) The Ministry of Grain originally planned to purchase the portion of the tax collected for the province to adjust the provincial finances. Recently, it was heard that it would only allow the purchase at the budgeted revenue price, and only pay one-third of the deposit payment first. Then the excess profit will all belong to the Ministry of Grain, which will not benefit the provincial finances or civil servants. Chen, the director of the Zhejiang Finance Department, decided to go to Beijing again tomorrow to ask the competent authorities for instructions because the provincial financial deficit is increasing day by day, and the expenses for the second half of October cannot be fully paid, and there will be no money in November. Chen has only been appointed as the director of the department for four months, and has already gone to Nanjing five times, which shows the difficulty of local finances.

### Boatmen Plot to Kill for Money / Cargo Owner Pushed into the Sea

[Our newspaper Wenzhou dispatch] A junk sailing ship from Shanghai, loaded with yarn, cloth and other goods, worth tens of millions of yuan, was transported to Jinjiang, Fujian.

### Giant Traitor Wang Nihua Jiu Flees / The High Court Prosecutor's Office Files a Public Prosecution

[Our newspaper Bengbu dispatch] Since the recovery of Bengbu, most of the traitors arrested and sanctioned have been figures in the political and economic fields. Cultural traitors did not seem to have been noticed by all parties in the past. Until recently, the famous cultural traitor Wang Nihua Jiu was reported and prosecuted by the First Branch of the Higher Court Prosecutor's Office here. It is learned that Ni Hua Jiu's original name was Zuyin, and he is now 50 years old. He is from Xuyi, Anhui Province, and graduated from the Anhui Provincial Public Law and Politics College. When Chen Diaoyuan was the governor of Anhui before the Northern Dynasties, Wang founded the Bengbu Political News Agency in Bengbu. After Hua ordered the army to Bengbu, he founded the Bengbu Daily and served as a correspondent for the news agency. Later, he also practiced law, and was greedy and shameless, and was despised by gentlemen. Because of his close relationship with the giant traitors of Anhui Province, Ni Daoyi, Kang Shaohou, Zhang Jinyu, etc., after Bengbu was occupied, they colluded with the traitors and established the Bengbu Maintenance Association and the Refugee Rehabilitation Committee, following the wishes of the Japanese invaders. Wang Ni served as the secretary of the Maintenance Association and dealt with the enemy, and then served as the president of the Bengbu Branch of the Greater People's Association, promoting peace and spying on military intelligence for the enemy. Last month, it was reported that the First Branch of the High Court Prosecutor's Office held that both the Greater People's Association and the New People's Association belonged to the enemy's intelligence agencies, and that the traitor had promoted peace and spied on military and political news for the enemy, which was a crime under Article 3 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. Prosecutor Shi Jingquan filed a public prosecution according to law. However, the indictment could not be served because the traitor Wang was hiding and there was no trace of him. Therefore, the indictment was served by public announcement in accordance with Article 59 of the Criminal Procedure Law. According to a side interview with the reporter, Wang was indeed a popular figure among the traitors during the enemy's occupation. Shortly after the victory, he fled to Beiping. Wang has a villa in Bengbu, called Zaiyuan, in front of the electric light factory in Renshouli, a Western-style building with lush flowers and trees, quite like a forest garden. Wang's family still lives here.

### Songjiang Distributes Food Boxes

Those who want to buy them need to bring money to Songjiang to order them.

### Cases of Robbery in Gucheng Lake Pile Up / Three Major Bandits Have Been Arrested

[Our newspaper Gaochun dispatch] Gucheng Lake, located in the southeast of this county near the urban area, covers an area of tens of miles, reaching the foothills of Xuancheng County, Anhui Province in the south. It is a waterway hub between Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, and the area through which goods must be transported and sold. Therefore, merchants from all over gather. Before the war, there were water police and life-saving boats from the life-saving bureau in this county patrolling the lake day and night to maintain security in the lake and rescue ships that had lost their way. They have not been restored to this day after the victory. In recent months, robberies in the lake have occurred frequently, and the safety of ships passing through the lake is worrying. The county administration often sees this and urgently needs to crack down on it and arrest the bandits in order to maintain security. A few days ago, the county security team specially dispatched many team soldiers, disguised and stationed in the jurisdiction of this county to detect the crimes. In the theater in Zhangjiagou Village, Liaotianba, the second district of this county, they detected a young man carrying a gun. They immediately questioned him and answered evasively. They believed that he must be a bad person and immediately escorted him to the county government. After interrogation, it was found that he was the bandit leader Ding Dehong, a native of Dangtu, Anhui Province, who now lives in Yuanbao District, Wuxi. He confessed that he had robbed many times in Gucheng Lake, including one time in March, one time in May, and another time on the 7th of this month when he robbed Tao, a merchant, of cloth and other items. Ding's main accomplice, Ding Defeng, originally lived in Gaotou Village, Wuxi. When he heard the news that Dehong had been arrested, he left his original place and lurked in Dingbu. As the news of the case became increasingly tense, he was uneasy and planned to escape to Yongyang again. However, when he passed through Caotang Township in this county, he was questioned by the local joint defense self-defense team. They believed that the circumstances were suspicious and arrested him and sent him to the county. After interrogation, he told the truth. The two criminals also confessed that Zhang Yugui in the Yudda Grain Store in Dongba was also an accomplice, and said that the gun was supplied by him. Although he did not come out to rob with them, he divided the loot in the store. Zhang Yugui is originally from Shandong and is a military man. During the period of occupation, he served as the intelligence director of Shencunbu in the 15th Independent Brigade of the Puppet Army. He opened the Yuda Grain Store in Dongba in June of this year. He was also arrested and is currently under strict interrogation.

### Commissioner Encounters Robbery on the Road

Guards Open Fire and the Whole Car Escapes

[Our newspaper Wuxing dispatch] Yu Shuluan, commissioner of the second district of Zhejiang Province, was ordered to Jinji on the 16th to attend the provincial water conservancy conference. After finishing his official business, he took the Hangzhou-Changxing passenger car back to Huzhou on the morning of the 23rd. When the car arrived at Penggongling, a crossroads on the Yuhang Highway, six bandits suddenly rushed out, all holding guns, and ordered the car to stop. Yu's guard, Shen Kunlong, immediately took out his wooden shell and shot. The bandits, seeing that the situation was not good, fled backwards. Although all the passengers in the car were frightened, they all escaped safely.

### National Health Conference: Zhejiang Province Proposals

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou 26th Dispatch] The National Health Conference is about to open. Xu Shilun, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Health Department, will soon go to the capital to attend. Mr. Xu is carrying several proposals, including: (1) Proposing to emulate the distinction between pharmacists and pharmacy students, establishing physicians and doctors as a two-tiered system to standardize titles, and renaming pharmacy students as pharmacy technicians to establish a public health system. (2) Suggesting that the Ministry of Education require nursing and midwifery schools to add courses in dispensing and testing to better serve rural health needs.

(4) Proposing that the Executive Yuan stipulate the percentage of points allocated to the health department in the performance evaluation of commissioners and county magistrates to facilitate the implementation of health administration. (5) Requesting approval from the central government to allocate funds to cover the significant deficit in Zhejiang Province's health budget for the 36th year of the Republic, to facilitate the implementation of plans. (6) Proposing that the Ministry of Health establish venereal disease prevention and treatment centers in provinces and cities to curb the spread of venereal diseases. (7) Proposing that the central government allocate significant epidemic prevention funds to the provinces to facilitate epidemic control measures.

### Huangdai Bully Arrested: Villagers Request Extreme Punishment

[Our Newspaper Suzhou Dispatch] Zhu Keting, a local bully from Huangdai Town in the county, was adept at currying favor with the enemy during the occupation, serving as a puppet Baozhang (village head) of Xili Township, tyrannizing the local area, colluding with the enemy police in everything, and harming the people. After the victory, realizing he could not escape punishment, he fled and disappeared. Recently, with the atmosphere easing, he secretly returned, but remained unrepentant. On the 16th of this month, taking advantage of the marriage of Xing Ahu, a villager in the township, he colluded with the local self-defense corps and went to extort money from a villager from Houzhai Town among the wedding guests. When the extortion failed, the two sides scuffled and entered the Huangdai District Office. The paratrooper unit of the Suppression and Joint Defense Zone stationed in the area learned of the incident and immediately dispatched personnel to arrest Zhu. Today, he was transferred to the Yangcheng District Suppression Headquarters for interrogation. The local villagers have jointly petitioned for him to be executed to appease public anger.

### Power Plant Planned on the Shores of Taihu Lake: Can Supply the Needs of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces

[Our Dispatch] The preparatory office of the Jiangnan Electric Power Bureau of the Resources Commission is actively planning a large-scale power plant on the shores of Taihu Lake to supply the needs of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The bureau originally planned to build a 750,000-kilowatt power plant, but due to various difficulties, it can only build a 200,000-kilowatt plant. Currently, Shanghai alone needs 200,000 kilowatts of power.

Mr. Bao has departed for Jibei.

### Wu Cangzhou to Wujin to Investigate: Malfeasance in the Auction of Enemy Property

[Our Newspaper Wujin Dispatch] The Wujin Office of the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau, in its previous auction of seized materials, had unreasonable and unfair valuations and improper procedures, leading to distrust from public groups. The Provisional Council, taking the lead, listed the corrupt acts of the office in a complaint to the Investigation Team, requesting a thorough investigation. On the 24th, the Second Group of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Seizure Investigation Team first sent Wu Cangzhou to Changzhou to conduct a preliminary investigation. It is reported that Mr. Wu's trip is primarily to thoroughly investigate eight major cases of corruption: (1) An enemy inland river vessel, capable of holding over eighty people, was valued and auctioned for only 70,000 yuan, less than the price of firewood. (2) The auction of over 24,000 gunny sacks, valued at 700 yuan each. The valuation committee considered the price too low and requested a revaluation, but the director of the office insisted on the original price. (3) The enemy-built concrete wharf and five bungalows in Dongjiao Zhoushi were directly valued at 2.5 million yuan by the office, which was also inappropriate. (4) The Songgang Yoko Brewery of the Bo'ai Men, with production equipment worth over 20 million yuan, was valued at only 11 million yuan. (5) The case of extortion of cigarettes for a house from a small shop in Xianxiang. (6) To whom was the homespun cloth sold? (7) Was Wang Xiaobao's land in Xinping Town sold? (8) The auction of scrap iron, worth 300,000 yuan per ton at the time, was auctioned for only 90,000 yuan per ton. In addition, the entire machinery and equipment of the Songgang Weaving Factory were underestimated by several experts at 39 million yuan. The office unilaterally allowed a certain factory to purchase it preferentially for 9 million yuan, resulting in a loss of 30 million yuan in national treasury revenue.

### Preparations to Resume Publication of the Huzhou Commercial News

[Our Newspaper Wuxing Dispatch] Before the war, seven newspapers were published in Wuxing: Huzhou Public News, Husheng Daily, New Husheng Daily, Huguang Daily, Huzhou Commercial News, Guolun Daily, and Hu Bao. All were suspended for financial reasons, except for Hu Bao, which moved west with the army during the enemy occupation and resumed publication on Double Ten Day last year after the victory. Now, Feng Jiuru and others plan to raise funds to resume publication of the Huzhou Commercial News, with a tentatively set fund of 10 million yuan. The funds have already been raised, and they are currently submitting an application to the relevant authorities for filing. Publication will resume as soon as approval is granted.

The Problem of Greater Shanghai's Development

I have previously submitted letters to your esteemed column twice regarding suburban transportation and requested that they be forwarded to the relevant municipal authorities. I am extremely grateful for your publication and reply. I am now reading in the newspaper that the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has concrete plans for the development of suburban transportation (especially in the former city center area of Jiangwan) and will implement them, which is very gratifying. In fact, the importance of transportation in the city center is no less than that in the urban area. Considering the current situation in the urban area in terms of population, residents, housing, and transportation, the scope of Greater Shanghai is too narrow. Unless suburban areas are developed to expand the urban area, it will not be able to join the ranks of world-class cities. Even the current municipal difficulties cannot be resolved without doing so. However, if we want to develop the urban area, we must first develop public transportation to attract residents to move there gradually and bring prosperity. Among the suburban areas that can be developed as extensions of the urban area, the city center area is the most suitable. Because the area should not be regarded as a suburb, but as the core of the New Shanghai. Before the war, Mayor Wu Tiecheng planned to develop the area as the municipal center, and considerable progress had already been made, which could rival the former concession area. Although the concessions have now been recovered, the facilities within them, such as the road system and wharves, do not meet the standards of a modern city. Therefore, in addition to that area, we must build a new, modern Greater Shanghai to meet the needs of the times. From the above facts, the revitalization of the city center area is urgent. The municipal authorities have long been aware of this, so their first step is to set up public bus routes to facilitate transportation with the current urban area and as a prerequisite for the construction of Greater Shanghai. Now that the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has made this decision, it should restore public buses in the city center area. However, due to the issue of vehicle assembly, the date of implementation must wait until the beginning of next month. I only hope that the Director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau will not merely promise something without delivering, to appease the urgent needs of the citizens. I feel that there are several points that the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau should pay attention to and be responsible for answering: (1) What will be the route of the vehicles going to the city center area in the future? Will it be the same as the routes operated by the former China Merchants Public Bus Company? (2) Can the planned No. 7 public bus route be extended and opened to traffic first to shorten the preparation period? (3) If the second point is not possible, when can the transportation in the area be effectively restored at the earliest? Which route number will it be, and what will be its starting and ending points? All should be announced as soon as possible. (Wei Zhesheng)

Please Strengthen Postal Delivery

Since the victory and recovery of Shanghai's postal service, business has been booming. According to people in the industry, the number of postal items has exceeded pre-war levels. With the population of Shanghai being dense and increasing compared to pre-war levels, it is no wonder that communications between various places are becoming more frequent. Those who communicate all hope that the postal delivery is fast. The postal authorities responsible for delivery are always trying to achieve the fastest possible efficiency within the possible range. However, judging from recent postal correspondence, it is far less fast and satisfactory than before the war. According to people in the industry, the reason for the recent delay in postal delivery is that transportation in various places has not yet been restored, and there are fewer employees handling postal affairs than before the war, resulting in a sharp decrease in efficiency. This is an unavoidable situation. I believe that increasing the number of postal employees is something that is possible. Why doesn't the Postal Bureau strengthen the efficiency of postal delivery? Why not add personnel, which can also alleviate unemployment? As for the economic gains and losses of the postal service, it should be regarded as another matter. The state-run agency was originally established to serve and facilitate the public. (Chen Xin)

Residents of Western Shanghai Call for Road Repairs

We, a group of people who have lived in Hongqiao Road for generations and rely on growing and selling vegetables for a living, have many intersecting roads here. Hongqiao Road and Zhongzheng West Road run vertically. The area north of the roads belongs to District 25, and the area south belongs to District 26. The people living on the horizontal roads all have to pass through Hongqiao Road and Zhongzheng West Road. Hongqiao Road is narrow and has many cars. The section of Zhongzheng West Road near Chengjiazhai was excavated and turned into a swamp by the enemy during their occupation to build their defensive works. Since then, the roads have been muddy when it rains, making it difficult for us vegetable vendors to walk, especially since Zhongzheng Road cannot be traversed east-west, which is unsightly and very inconvenient for transportation. We hope that the Public Works Bureau will connect this road east-west to facilitate public travel. (Tu Shuren)

Please Include Road Names in Theater Advertisements

The major movie theaters and theaters in Shanghai do not include road names in their daily advertisements, so people coming to Shanghai from inland areas often want to see the good plays at various theaters, but they are unable to find the theaters because they do not know which road they are on. They can only sigh in vain when they see the advertisements. We hope that the major theaters will include road names when publishing advertisements in the future. We would be very grateful. (Zhuang Ke)

Sludge from Canal Dredging Flows Everywhere

The entrance to Meifuli Alley at Anyuan Road and Jiaozhou Road in Western Shanghai is blocked by foul-smelling canals. Although the authorities recently sent personnel to dredge the canals, the workers are not only ineffective in their work, but also deliberately negligent, piling the excavated sludge on the roadside without using wooden frames to contain it, causing mud to spread everywhere, hindering pedestrians, and emitting a foul odor due to solar evaporation, which is detrimental to both sanitation and transportation. We hope that the authorities will pay attention to this matter and order a prompt improvement for the sake of public convenience. (Wei Hongqing)

### The Issue of the Five Powers' Veto Right: Resolved to be Included in the UN General Assembly Agenda; Chinese Chief Delegate Gu Weijun States Three Reasons; The Soviet Union Ultimately Voluntarily Withdraws Its Request

[United Press New York 25th Dispatch] The United Nations General Assembly's Steering Committee, with the accommodating attitudes of the representatives of both the United States and the Soviet Union, decided today to submit the thorny issue of the veto right to the General Assembly for open discussion. The Soviet Union had originally requested that this issue not be included in the agenda, which had raised concerns about causing another conflict between the country and the Western powers. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky suddenly announced today that he was withdrawing the original proposal, and the situation turned from dangerous to safe. US Representative Austin had previously led the opposition to the Soviet Union's request and had proposed that the veto issue be immediately submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. However, due to the Soviet Union's concession, he announced that he would also withdraw his own proposal. With the settlement of the US-Soviet dispute, the veto issue was decided by Chairman Spaak to be included in the General Assembly agenda as usual, and then submitted to the Political Committee for discussion. Austin also declared that the Soviet Union's willingness to compromise proves that this world organization is bound to succeed. The General Assembly's Steering Committee is composed of fourteen countries. The Soviet Union initially formally proposed that the veto issue should not be included in the General Assembly agenda. According to Vyshinsky, any change to the veto right provisions of the United Nations Charter would be a major blow to the United Nations organization. The United Kingdom and the United States immediately opposed this, arguing that the reason for their opposition was not that the veto right stipulated in the United Nations Charter should be changed, but that the General Assembly should not be deprived of the right to discuss this issue. The leaders of the opposition were British Representative Shawcross, followed by Cuba and Australia, who proposed that the veto issue should be discussed in order to decide whether it should be restricted or abolished. Representatives of six countries, including China, spoke out against the Soviet proposal.

[Central News Agency New York 25th Special Dispatch] Our Chief Delegate and Vice President of the General Assembly, Gu Weijun, forcefully stated in the Steering Committee the reasons for keeping the thorny veto issue on the agenda, which can be said to represent the general situation of the General Assembly. He stated that the Chinese delegation attaches great importance to Article 27 of the United Nations Charter regarding the voting procedures of the Security Council. Mr. Gu presented the following three reasons for supporting the proposals of Australia and Cuba on the General Assembly agenda: (1) The two countries' proposals are in line with the spirit of the Charter, (2) placing the proposals on the provisional agenda is in accordance with the rules of procedure, and (3) since the entire issue of the veto right has aroused great concern and anxiety around the world, an open and transparent discussion of the issue by the United Nations General Assembly will have a "beneficial effect" on public opinion. Mr. Gu told the Steering Committee that although China is a country that has the right to apply this veto right, it has never exercised this right, because the Chinese government believes that the rule of unanimous consent should only be used in important situations, so its use should be exercised with the utmost care and distinction. Mr. Gu concluded by saying that the General Assembly's discussion of the veto issue may not have concrete results, but at least it can clear the world's atmosphere. China currently does not want to endorse any decision to convene a full United Nations conference, because there is no need to amend the principle of unanimous consent. Mr. Gu declared that China will issue a more detailed statement on its views on the veto issue in the General Assembly.

### British Representative's Speech: Criticizes Abuse of the Veto Right; But Opposes Amending the Charter

[Central News Agency New York 25th Special Dispatch] British Representative Noel-Baker, in his speech to the General Assembly today, was able to fulfill his dual responsibilities. As the first speaker of a major power, he responded to the criticisms from small countries about the lack of achievements of the United Nations by recounting the accomplishments of the United Nations since its establishment. In addition, as the spokesman for the United Kingdom, he strongly declared his opposition to any proposals to amend the Charter, but also frankly criticized the Soviet Union's "unrestrained use of the veto right." He earnestly requested his Soviet colleagues not to indulge in the use of this right. However, he defended the right to disagree of major powers in the Security Council, and suggested improving the rules of procedure of the Security Council and adding a new spirit to the work of the Security Council. He strongly defended the Security Council and asked the General Assembly to support it. Mr. Noel-Baker went on to express confidence in the trusteeship system and attacked "plundering imperialism." He expressed his firm belief that the trusteeship system will become a driving force to eliminate the evils of imperialism.

### Control of Atomic Energy: Soviet Union Reiterates Belief

[News Report] San Francisco 26th Broadcast: Today, Soviet Representative Gromyko reiterated in the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission the Soviet Union's belief that the control of atomic energy can be handled by each country independently, formally denying the rumor that the United Nations has held secret negotiations on the atomic energy issue. Last night, British Representative and Minister of Aviation Noel-Baker fully supported the US proposal to control atomic energy in the United Nations General Assembly, stating that if an international control method for atomic energy cannot be established, the result will inevitably lead to competition in atomic energy. Mr. Baker stated that this competition is currently underway and may plunge the world into chaos.

### Investigating Foreign Troops: The Soviet Union Raises an Old Issue; Requests that it be Included in the Agenda

[United Press New York 25th Dispatch] Today, according to sources close to the British delegation, the United Kingdom will not oppose the Soviet Union's proposal to investigate the issue of United Nations troops stationed in non-enemy territories for discussion by the United Nations General Assembly. This issue was previously rejected by the Security Council for inclusion in the agenda. The Soviet Union then raised the old issue again and included it in the provisional agenda of the United Nations General Assembly.

### Indian Representative Delivers Stirring Speech: Criticizes "Imperialism"; The Discrimination Against Overseas Chinese in South Africa Should be Subject to Public Judgment; Also Requests a Seat on the Council

[Agence France-Presse New York 26th Dispatch] Indian Representative Mrs. Pandit (the younger sister of Nehru) delivered a stirring speech lasting thirty minutes at today's United Nations General Assembly session, which won enthusiastic applause. Mrs. Pandit requested that the United Nations grant India a position in the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council, saying that India must undertake a task commensurate with its geographical position and its wartime contributions. Looking at the current world, power still prevails over justice. In political, economic and social terms, it is still dominated by imperialism. Some countries are willing to violate the principles of the United Nations Charter to achieve their own desires. We demand that from now on, all actions to defend the interests of imperialism by force and to suppress the desire for national independence should be prohibited. As far as East India is concerned, Indian troops are being used to fight against the local national army, and this situation must be stopped. The minority of Indians in South Africa are currently being mistreated and should be subject to public judgment by the General Assembly. As for the South African government's request to merge the South West Africa Trust Territory into the South African Federation, the Indian government hereby declares its opposition.

### 300 Overseas Chinese in South Africa Separately Punished with Fines

Gandhi's son, Manilal, was also among them. This is the largest trial since the Indians here launched a passive resistance movement. India has already appealed to the United Nations General Assembly about the mistreatment of the minority of Indians in South Africa.

### Latin America and the Arab League Form a Group: To Enhance their Position in the UN General Assembly

[Central News Agency New York 26th Dispatch] Latin American and Arab League countries, which together account for more than half of the United Nations, have reportedly formed separate groups to give their political views a stronger voice in the United Nations General Assembly. Argentina convened a meeting of twenty Latin American countries over the weekend to discuss general issues related to South America, which was the first hint of the above attempt. The Latin American countries' meeting will decide on Mexico's successor in the Security Council and Colombia's successor in the Economic and Social Council. Judging from the current signs, the Latin American countries will support Colombia to participate in the Security Council, while Uruguay seems to be moderately between the too right-leaning Argentina and the too left-leaning Venezuela. Among the Arab League countries, it is reported that Syria will definitely replace Egypt in the Security Council. It is also reported that the Arab countries have decided to oppose any proposals to hand over the mandate of Palestine to the United Nations for supervision during the discussion of the trusteeship issue.

### Request from La Guardia for the United Nations to Take Over the Work of UNRRA

La Guardia's report has been submitted to the UN General Assembly, requesting the Assembly to have a "comprehensive proposal" on how to supply relief needs after UNRRA ceases providing relief materials. The report includes an analysis of the economic situations in countries such as Greece, Albania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Australia, and China.

### Bulgaria to Hold Elections Today; U.S. Government Declares It Will Guarantee Free Elections Despite Soviet Opposition

[United Press, Beijing, 26th Dispatch] The Protection Council is scheduled to be re-elected tomorrow. In addition to the Communist Party and other four ruling parties of the Fatherland Front, the competing parties include the National Agrarian Union, the Bulgarian Democratic Party, and the Social Democratic Party. The Communist Party within the Fatherland Front has the greatest influence and seized power in Bulgaria two years ago, breaking away from the Axis and joining the Allied camp. It first won the election last November. The opposition parties requested a postponement of this election on the 10th of this month, stating that free elections are impossible under the current circumstances.

[This Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 26th Broadcast: The U.S. State Department declared today that the Soviet representative on the Allied Control Commission for Bulgaria opposed the U.S. proposal to send personnel to supervise the elections in Bulgaria this Sunday, and stated that this attitude is equivalent to refusing to recognize the previous agreement, which requires that all measures concerning Bulgaria must be mutually agreed upon by the U.S., the U.K., and the U.S.S.R. The U.S. plan advocates counting the ballots on the spot, without consolidating them first, to avoid delays, and dispatching personnel to supervise at each polling station. However, Soviet representative Biriuzov believes that this is tantamount to interfering in Bulgaria's internal affairs and is unacceptable. The U.S. court issued a warning today stating that the U.S. government, unwilling to be deterred by Soviet opposition, intends to implement its pledge to guarantee free elections. However, the State Department has not disclosed what actions it intends to take.

### Japan's Ambition Has Not Died; Attempts to Deceive and Obtain Atomic Bombs

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 26th Dispatch] Japanese figures from all walks of life held a symposium on the current situation today. Former Ambassador to the U.S. Kurosawa and Professor Yokota of Tokyo Imperial University were present. During the session, the chief writer of the "Yomiuri Shimbun," Baba, stated that for the sake of creating world peace, the Allied countries should store a batch of atomic bombs in Japan and entrust them to peace-loving Japan for safekeeping. Currently, the main war crisis is due to the existence of atomic bombs. Since the new Japanese constitution has stipulated the renunciation of the right to wage war, the United Nations should recognize its peaceful intentions and grant Japan the right to keep this forbidden weapon.

### British-Egyptian Negotiations Reach Another Stalemate; Sudan Demands Independence

[United Press, London, 25th Dispatch] The negotiations on the British-Egyptian treaty have reached another stalemate. Both sides' representatives are tight-lipped as to whether it will be moved to Cairo. Egyptian Foreign Minister Hafez Ramadan and Ambassador to the U.K. Sami, after visiting Prime Minister Attlee, went to the British Foreign Office, presumably to discuss ways to break the deadlock. According to those around Attlee: The future status of Sudan is more important than the withdrawal of British troops. The British want to station troops in Egypt for three years, but the Egyptians want at most two years, a difference of only twelve months.

[Reuters, London, 25th Dispatch] The Secretary-General of the Sudanese Umma Party, Khalil, came to London representing the party to demand the complete independence of Sudan. Khalil stated today: Egypt wants to obtain full power over Sudan in order to realize its imperial dream. If Sudan does not obtain independence, it is willing to be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations. Egypt's demand to obtain sovereignty over Sudan is only motivated by expanding its territory. The Sudanese and Egyptians are completely different ethnic groups. If a referendum is held, the majority of Sudanese will advocate breaking away from both Britain and Egypt and becoming independent.

### The First Difficult Problem in the United Nations General Assembly: The Use of the Veto Power

— (This Newspaper's Research Department)

The United Nations General Assembly officially opened in New York on October 23, and the world's attention has shifted from Paris to New York again. However, after seeing the sharp confrontation and numerous disputes between the U.S. and Soviet blocs at the Paris Peace Conference in the Luxembourg Palace, peace-loving people around the world cannot help but feel worried about the potential achievements of this United Nations General Assembly and dare not have excessive expectations. However, after all, countries around the world are hoping for peace and stability, and we do not need to be overly pessimistic about the complicated international situation. In this General Assembly, we can already see several difficult problems. If the two opposing blocs can cherish the hard-won peace and be mutually tolerant and accommodating to seek a reasonable and appropriate solution to these problems, then the success of the General Assembly can be predicted. These difficult problems, such as the great powers' veto power, the issue of territorial trusteeship, the European refugee relief issue, etc., will definitely spark a fierce debate at this General Assembly. Here, we will analyze and introduce the origins, background, and current situation of these issues one by one, which can also help readers understand what dark reefs are lying beneath the surface of world peace.

Now, let's start with the first difficult problem, the "veto power." The veto power of the great powers is a legacy of power politics. In 1944, the U.S., U.K., the Soviet Union, and China gathered at Dumbarton Oaks in the United States to discuss the organization of a future world peace organization for the first time. The Soviet Union strongly advocated that powerful countries must have special privileges in the future international organization. Therefore, in the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals, no decision was made on the issue of voting methods in the world organization. It was not until the Yalta Conference in February 1945 that Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin agreed on the principles of the Security Council voting method in the future world organization. This later became known as the "Yalta Voting Formula." This formula was adopted by the San Francisco Conference and incorporated into Article 27 of Chapter 5 of the United Nations Charter, which reads in full:

"(1) Each member of the Security Council shall have one vote. (2) Decisions of the Security Council on procedural matters shall be made by an affirmative vote of seven members. (3) Decisions of the Security Council on all other matters shall be made by an affirmative vote of seven members including the concurring votes of the permanent members; provided that, in decisions under Chapter VI, and under paragraph 3 of Article 52, a party to a dispute shall abstain from voting."

This third point is very important, because it includes the so-called veto power of the great powers. We know that the most important mission of the United Nations organization is to resolve difficulties and disputes, turn hostility into friendship, and enable countries to resolve international disputes and conflicts peacefully at the table, instead of resorting to arms on the battlefield. The burden of this heavy and sacred mission is not borne by all members of the United Nations General Assembly, but by the Security Council. Therefore, the Security Council is the de facto guiding and executive core of the United Nations organization. The Security Council is composed of eleven countries, including the five permanent members: the U.S., U.K., the Soviet Union, France, and China. The remaining six countries are non-permanent members, elected by the General Assembly. When discussing so-called "procedural matters," the eleven countries are completely equal, and as long as seven countries agree (that is, more than one-third), the motion can be passed. However, when discussing all other matters other than procedures (i.e., so-called "substantive matters"), the status of the eleven members is not equal. The passage of each substantive matter requires not only the approval of a majority of seven or more votes, but also that the seven votes must include the votes of all five permanent members. In other words, the U.S., U.K., the Soviet Union, France, and China each have such great power that even if ten of the eleven votes agree, if one of them votes against it, the motion is overturned. This is the so-called "veto power."

The problem lies here. First: How exactly is the strict distinction made between "procedural matters" and "substantive matters?" In fact, larger matters belonging to international disputes are of course substantive matters, and the veto power can be used. Second: Although the use of the veto power also has some limitations, that is, the provision in Chapter VI of the Charter and paragraph 3 of Article 52 that "when the Security Council is endeavoring to achieve a peaceful settlement of an international dispute, a state party to the dispute, even if it is a permanent member of the Council, shall not participate in the vote," the interpretation of this provision has also become a major problem, with differing opinions. Some argue that this limitation only applies when a "dispute" has occurred, and does not apply to any "situation" that may cause international friction or disputes. Here, the problem arises again: How should the strict distinction be made between "dispute" and "situation?" International issues are often very complex and delicate, and it is not easy to distinguish them so mechanically.

The initial provision of this veto power in the Charter also had its unavoidable difficulties. Because if the Security Council's mediation of a dispute fails, it can also have the power to impose economic and transport blockades, sever diplomatic relations, and even use force against countries that undermine peace. All these things would be very difficult to implement in practice, and might even lead to the opposite result, if the five permanent members did not agree and take consistent steps. Although countries in the world should be equal regardless of size, in fact, the status of the five great powers is much more important, and in order to enable them to reach mutual agreement and avoid turning against each other, the establishment of the veto power is a good way to prevent things from completely freezing, and the intention cannot be said to be unkind.

However, this method set up for positive goals has become a tool for passive resistance. At the Paris Peace Conference, many issues could not be discussed at all because the Soviet representative repeatedly used the veto power. The widespread use of the veto power will further make the United Nations organization and the Security Council nominal, unable to do anything. Countries have deeply felt this pain, especially the smaller countries, which are preparing to propose the abolition of the veto power at this General Assembly. As for the position of the major powers, President Truman made it clear in his speech on the opening day of the General Assembly that he supported full discussion of the veto power issue, and even appropriate amendments. On the British side, Prime Minister Attlee and former Prime Minister Churchill also spoke out, advocating that the use of the veto power should be limited to conform to the democratic trend of the world. However, the Soviet side is taking firm steps, strongly supporting the veto power and fighting against its opponents. The Soviet Union has its own unavoidable difficulties in adopting this position, because the Soviet bloc is in the minority, whether in the 51-nation General Assembly or the 11-nation Security Council. Therefore, if all issues are voted on in a democratic way with a "majority vote," then the Soviet bloc will have no room to intervene in anything. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible to abolish the veto power, and I am afraid it is not what the U.S. and Britain want. The only way seems to be to make appropriate interpretations and supplements to its use. This difficult problem has now been decided to be included in the agenda. We are sure to see a wonderful and fierce verbal battle.

### Movie Theaters to Donate Proceeds from Extra Morning Shows to Schools

[This Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Film Industry Trade Association held a general meeting at the Majestic Theater yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to discuss celebrating Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 60th birthday and the entertainment tax issue. Representatives from 33 units in the film industry attended.

### Discussions in the Film Industry Regarding the Entertainment Tax: Should It Be Forty Percent?

Regarding the results of discussions on the entertainment tax, it was decided to comply with the resolution of the Finance Committee of the Municipal Council, with the Finance Bureau handling the matter in accordance with the relevant resolution. The association will send representatives, including Executive Director Li Diyun, to the Finance Bureau to request an exemption from the 20% levy for the National Defense Corps' expenses. At the same time, according to the resolution of the Municipal Council, an additional 10% will be added. Therefore, based on the original 30% levy plus 10%, the total should be 40%.

A reporter interviewed Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, regarding this matter. According to Director Gu, the Municipal Council decided to increase the entertainment tax to 50%. The Finance Bureau has no authority to change the resolution of the Council. However, the Finance Committee of the Council resolved to have the Finance Bureau handle the matter at its discretion. The Finance Bureau will respect this opinion. Nevertheless, how to levy the tax in a way that resolves the demands of the film and theater industries and also allows the industry to convince the Council to pass it still requires a joint discussion with the Council to find a reasonable solution.

### Salt Loan Review Committee Resolves Two Major Cases

The Salt Loan Review Committee held its sixth meeting at the Bank of China Building at 3:00 PM yesterday, and passed the following major proposals: (1) Before salt merchants transport salt, they must prepare a substantial amount of cash to pay taxes to the local salt authorities (referring to the Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Wuhu regions). To alleviate the difficulty of financing for the salt merchants, the agency banks may advance the tax payment as part of the pre-export financing.

### Eighty-Two-Year-Old Dr. Francis Pott Returns to China from the United States: "This is My Home; I Want to Live Here Forever Until I Die!"

[Special Report by This Newspaper] Crack, crack, clap, clap! The sound of firecrackers echoed at the gate of St. John's University. This was to welcome Dr. Francis Pott, who is eighty-two years old. Professors, students, and staff members surged from different directions to welcome the old president! Two cars, carrying Dr. and Mrs. Pott and those who welcomed them, drove across the lawn of St. John's and stopped in front of the small Western-style house numbered 24.

This is a semi-new, semi-damaged small Western-style house. The second floor has bedrooms, and the ground floor has a living room, study, dining room, and kitchen. Dr. Pott spent more than fifty years in this exquisite residence. In 1941—the fourth year after the Lugouqiao Incident—Dr. Pott went to his hometown—the United States—originally hoping to return to China within six months, but the outbreak of the Pacific War destroyed all planned schedules. Dr. Pott could only temporarily reside in his hometown. However, this friend of China was always thinking about his second hometown!

Chinese Wife Died Early

During the five years that Dr. Pott was away, this small Western-style house was taken care of by a Mrs. Lin on his behalf. Mrs. Lin is Dr. Pott's niece—the niece of his Chinese wife. Dr. Pott has been married twice. His first wife was Chinese, but unfortunately, she died early. His current wife is British and is the same age as Dr. Pott. They came to China almost at the same time. The doctor has been in China for sixty years, and his wife for fifty-nine years. At that time, Mrs. Pott taught at St. Mary's Hall, and Dr. Pott served as the president of St. John's. Due to shared interests and environmental needs, they lived together, even though they were both already over fifty years old.

Three Sons and One Daughter Each Have a Profession

Dr. Pott has three sons and one daughter, all born to his Chinese wife. The eldest son is Professor James, who now teaches at St. John's and has given birth to a grandson for Dr. Pott, who is already eleven years old this year and studies at the American School on Route Petain. In addition, the two younger sons and a daughter are all in the United States. The second son is a principal, the youngest son is a doctor, and the daughter is a teacher. The current British wife's former husband's surname was Cooper, and he left behind a daughter, who is now over forty years old. Miss Cooper and Professor James never left Shanghai during the war. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, they were detained in concentration camps and moved from Yangzhou to Pudong, suffering greatly. After the victory, everyone was able to reunite in the United States. Professor James returned to St. John's two months ago, eager to be in China. Miss Cooper and Dr. and Mrs. Pott arrived in China at the same time the day before yesterday.

Old Home Was Safe During the Occupation Period

For the sake of Miss Cooper, this old Western-style house almost suffered a raid. After Miss Cooper was detained in a concentration camp, Japanese military police visited the house, saying that they would seal the house and move the furniture away—fortunately, Mrs. Lin insisted that the house belonged to her, saying that Miss Cooper was just a guest. But the Japanese military police said, "Guests should also have their own belongings!" In this way, they took away a dressing table, wardrobe, and stool forcefully. Fortunately, the complete set of furniture and valuable antiques were safe!

Now, Dr. and Mrs. Pott have returned to their old home. This old Western-style house, semi-new furniture, Chinese paintings and antique porcelain adorning the walls, Western-style books on the bookshelves… everything is still the same as it was five years ago, so intimate and flavorful. So, Dr. Pott smiled, and more wrinkles appeared on his face.

He stepped into the study, sat in the armchair, and proudly said to the reporter, "I can speak Shanghainese, very good Shanghainese. I have even written a book telling foreigners how to learn Shanghainese. I also read Chinese newspapers, especially Shen Bao. Even in the United States, I often read Shen Bao!"

No Criticism of the Shen Siliang Case

When talking about St. John's University, he said, "It has changed. How can there be so many students?" "However," he continued, "this is an abnormal development after the war, and I firmly believe that it will soon return to normal."

Dr. Pott's mood during the conversation was always exceptionally pleasant, but when the reporter asked about his opinion on the former president, Shen Siliang, his face suddenly darkened. After a moment of silence, he said slowly, "I am not very willing to express my opinion on this matter because I am not very clear about this matter. Naturally, it is very unfortunate, and I am very sad." When asked if he would like to visit him, he said, "Even if I am willing, it is impossible because it is not allowed!"

Staying in China for a Long Time, Never Returning to the United States

"How long are you planning to stay in China this time?" Dr. Pott seemed not to believe his ears when he heard this sentence and immediately said, "Pardon!" When the reporter repeated it again, he seemed to think it was unnecessary for the reporter to ask this question. He said seriously, "This is my home. I want to live here forever until I die!"

When asked if he would be the president again, he said, "No, I'm too old."

"No, you're still very young!" the reporter replied. Indeed, Dr. Pott's every move did not resemble an eighty-two-year-old man at all. He is still young, and he will continue to work hard for education!

### The Secrets of the Shanghai Pickpocket Gang (7)

— Huang Jiamo

The performances of the above-mentioned various "trickery plays" are repeated day after day, knowing that they are illegal activities. Therefore, each group, in addition to the main actor, also assigns various duties to assist.

(A) "Mediator" - This is an accomplice disguised as a passerby, as a medium to lure people into the game, so it must be neatly dressed and eloquent. After placing a bet, they must win money repeatedly and get quick compensation, so that petty citizens, seeing the profit, will happily place a bet and be deceived.

(B) "Lookout" - This is like a sentry in the army, preventing sudden police attacks, so lookouts must be placed before and after the bridge frame.

(C) "Bribe-payer" - This kind of accomplice specializes in carrying bribes on the body. Once an arrest is made, if there is an opportunity to bribe, they must bribe so that they can be released on the spot.

"Everyone Uses Black-Hearted Money"

The "Pickpocket Gang" of old brothers believe that cleverly seizing and plundering is their way of life. Therefore, the brothers in the gang value friendship very much and do not value money. There is a slogan in the gang: "Everyone uses black-hearted money", which means that ill-gotten wealth should be shared. Therefore, the brothers in the gang can always "get a piece of the pie" every time they act. If the money received is not cash but stolen goods, it should be distributed in proportion after the sale. The rule is that the person who does the picking gets 40%, and the rest is distributed according to the effort made. Although the grades are different, they must not argue about the amount.

If the victim is a person in government or a close or distant relative of someone with power, after the theft, detectives will be dispatched, refusing to give up, and can also find out who caused the trouble based on the time and location of the incident and the activity route. The gang must then "return the jade intact." Therefore, everyone who has been involved in sharing the pie must "vomit the pickings," which means returning the money and goods they have obtained. This is what the gang considers "disappointing," but for the safety of the entire gang, they have to reluctantly part with it. Usually, the pickpockets' possessions must be kept for four days. If there is no dangerous rumor, they can be openly distributed. All the stolen goods obtained by pickpocketing are sold to a kind of "black shop" for very little money. Although they know that they are losing money, they have to get rid of it quickly for safety's sake, because this is also based on the gang's creed - the principle of "everyone uses black-hearted money."

### Mr. Frederick Maze, Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs, Passes Away; Funeral to be Held at the International Cemetery This Morning; Successor Not Yet Determined

[Reported by This Newspaper] Mr. Frederick Maze, Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs in this city, passed away at Hong En Hospital on Great West Road at 8:30 PM on the 25th. Mr. Maze was of British nationality and entered the Customs Service in 1913, the third year of the Republic of China. He was intelligent and capable and held important positions in the Customs Service. In 1941, the 30th year of the Republic of China, when the Pacific War broke out, he was imprisoned in a concentration camp by the enemy and suffered greatly, which greatly affected his health. After the victory, he returned to his country via transit. In June of this year, he was invited by our government to return to Shanghai and serve as the Commissioner of Customs. At the beginning of his appointment, due to excessive work intensity and failure to recover from the ordeal, he was hospitalized at Hong En Hospital due to illness, but he always tried his best to serve the public. According to a person in charge of the Jianghai Customs, Mr. Maze勉力 went to the Customs Office for a routine checkup as of the 14th of this month. From the 15th onward, his illness worsened drastically, and the doctor diagnosed him with heart and lung diseases, leading to his death the day before yesterday. He was 53 years old and had one son and one daughter. His only son died in the Great War. His wife arrived from England last week and was by his side. The remains have been moved to the International Funeral Home. Mr. Maze was a Catholic and the funeral will be held at the Catholic Church at 235 Rue Poussin this morning. At 10 o'clock, the remains will be transported to the International Cemetery on Jing'an Temple Road for burial.

Whether the successor to Mr. Maze after his death will be a foreigner or a Chinese is currently unknown, but it is reported that the Ministry of Finance is considering it. Also, during Mr. Maze's sick leave, his duties were performed by Permanent Customs Commissioner Liu Bingyi, so many believe that Mr. Liu may be a possible candidate. Mr. Liu served as Commissioner of Customs in Chongqing during the war and was sent to Dalian after the victory to take over the Dalian Customs, but it did not happen due to the special situation.

### Robbery on Rue du Consulat: One Fierce Robber Dies of Serious Injuries

[Reported by This Newspaper] A robbery occurred at the Dajiangnan Shoe Store at the intersection of Rue du Consulat and Chengdu Road at 9:30 PM the night before last. After the brave pursuit and capture by the police officers of the Xincheng Precinct, five robbers were captured after a four-hour period. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper.

### The Bronze Statue of Li Ping Shu is Erected in Memory of His Lasting Influence on Shanghai

[Reported by This Newspaper] The unveiling ceremony of the bronze statue of Mr. Li Tongmin (i.e., Li Pingshu) was solemnly held at Huxin Pavilion in the Chenghuang Temple in Nanshi at 10:00 AM yesterday. The entrance of the Chenghuang Temple was decorated with a colorful archway, and the bronze statue was erected in the lotus pond of Huxin Pavilion in the Chenghuang Temple. At the entrance of Huxin Pavilion, there was a horizontal plaque inscribed with the words "Benefit Universal to Shanghai" by President Jiang, and on the wall in the center of the pavilion, there was a horizontal plaque inscribed with the words "Virtue Covers the Shanghai Area" by Mayor Wu.

At 10:00 AM, firecrackers exploded in unison on the Nine-Turn Bridge, and the Boy Scout band played melodious music. The unveiling ceremony of the bronze statue began on time. Mayor Wu presided over the ceremony. In his speech, the Mayor said: "I am deeply moved to participate in the unveiling ceremony of Mr. Li Pingshu today. There is an ancient saying in China: 'The highest is to establish virtue, the second is to establish merit.' The so-called merit is definitely not about being a high-ranking official, nor is it about being famous. Merit is about truly serving the people." "In this world, there are countless people who have higher positions and greater fame than Mr. Li, but there are very few who can be eternally remembered by the local people like Mr. Li. From this example, we have come to the conclusion that no matter what undertaking, as long as it truly serves the people, it will be loved," Mayor Wu said. "Nanshi is our own Chinese, and we must actively repair it no matter what. The renovation of roads and the repair of wharfs are all in the planning stage. If all the wharfs are completed and put into use, I firmly believe that it can be restored within three years." Mayor Wu's speech ended with applause. Fang Zhi (representing Xie Dahuang), Director of the Municipal Party Department, and Qian Xinzhi then delivered speeches. After Li Xiangfu, the grandson of Li Pingshu, gave a thank you speech, the ceremony ended.

### The Executive Yuan Will Focus on Post-Disaster Work - A Grand Tea Party Was Held Yesterday - Appealing to All Sectors for Assistance

[Our Newspaper News] Huo Baoshu, Director of the Executive Yuan, Li Zhuo, Deputy Director, and Liu Hongsheng, Executive Director, held a grand tea party at the Bank of China on the fourth floor yesterday afternoon to entertain all sectors of the city and appeal for assistance in promoting the work of the Executive Yuan. Mayor Wu, Kong Xiangxi, General Egerton, representative of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in China, Cheng Zhonghang, Xu Jilun, Fang Zhi, Liu Gongyun, Zhao Zukang, Gu Chunfan, Li Ximou, Xi Yushu, and worker Lin and other Chinese and foreign guests, about 150 people, attended.

Director Huo first gave a speech, briefly stating: In the past year, the Executive Yuan has encountered many difficulties, but there are also many shortcomings in its own work, which it hopes to gradually improve in the future. It will strive for fairness in the distribution of materials. In the future, the work of the Executive Yuan will focus on post-disaster relief, such as industrial and mining equipment, which will be shipped in succession. It is necessary for the financial and transportation sectors to provide more assistance, and it is hoped that local officials will provide as much convenience and cooperation as possible. At the same time, he expressed his gratitude and pleasure for the cooperation and assistance of General Egerton.

Subsequently, Kong Xiangxi reported on his negotiations for relief supplies in the United States, and said that we should not arbitrarily criticize UNRRA materials, and should take into account the goodwill of the donors. He hoped that the Executive Yuan's post-disaster relief work should not be passive relief, but should pay attention to constructive relief.

Mayor Wu Explains Three Points

Then, Mayor Wu explained three points: (1) The local government also regrets that the Executive Yuan's relief work is not perfect, and will try its best to assist in the future. (2) The municipal government has decided to carry out winter relief this year, and hopes that UNRRA and the Executive Yuan can also provide assistance. (3) UNRRA and the Executive Yuan hope that the year will end soon, and the government will continue to carry out this work, and at the same time, it still hopes that local people will jointly maintain it.

After Mayor Wu's speech, Inspector Cheng Zhonghang gave a speech. He believed that according to his personal investigation, there were three reasons why the work of the Executive Yuan could not be satisfactory: (1) domestic instability, (2) financial problems, and (3) problems on the government side. He also believed that both Jiang and Huo had made their best efforts, and wished the work of the Executive Yuan would become better and better. Finally, Edward, director of the United China Relief Association, General Egerton, and Chairman Fang, among others, gave speeches one after another, and the event ended happily at around 6:00 pm.

### Land Return Embezzlement Case - District Prosecutor's Office Begins Investigation - All Three Defendants Failed to Appear Yesterday

[Our Newspaper News] The Gaoqiao District land administration embezzlement case, which was questioned by Councillors Tao Baichuan and others at the first session of the Shanghai Municipal Council, was launched for investigation yesterday morning by the District Prosecutor's Office after summoning the victims. Back in 1940, during the period of Shanghai's fall, an enemy-organized Hengchan Company, under the order of the enemy military headquarters, forcibly requisitioned 693 mu, 3 fen, 4 li, and 8 hao of civilian land along the riverbank in the Gaoqiao District of Pudong. After the victory, the Municipal Land Administration Bureau, at the request of the people of the district, returned the land to the respective owners, and decided to recover 20,000 yuan per mu. At that time, a man named Zhou Songqian, who had served as a Baozhang during the enemy puppet period, was quite powerful in the local area, and claimed to be a representative of the people, contacted the Land Administration Bureau to handle the return of the land, and took the opportunity to defraud the villagers. The Land Administration Bureau originally decided to recover only 20,000 yuan per mu for the returned land, but Zhou actually charged an extra 80,000 yuan. All 106 victimized owners were fooled, and the total amount of fraud reached tens of millions of yuan. After the matter was reported, the Land Administration Bureau immediately conducted a thorough investigation. Zhang Jiliang, the head of the responsible section, and Huang Qiren, a clerk, were suspected of colluding with the embezzlement of their duties. They were dismissed and released on bail by the Land Administration Bureau, and the case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

The defendants Zhou Songqian, Zhang Jiliang, and Huang Qiren all failed to appear. It is said that the inside story of the case is complicated and involves a wide range of people. Chen Shiquan, the former director of the Land Administration Bureau, may also be summoned for questioning when necessary.

### French Ship Resumes Far East Route - "Song Dan" Delayed Arrival in Shanghai

To Return to France After Repairs in Shanghai

[Our Newspaper News] The French ship "Song Dan," with a load of more than 8,000 tons, which is the first French ship to resume the Far East route after the war, suffered damage to its machinery near Singapore. It was repaired briefly in Singapore and then sailed to Saigon. After a brief stay, it sailed to Hong Kong. It came north from Hong Kong on Thursday and was expected to arrive today. However, because the ship was not thoroughly repaired in Singapore, its sailing is still slow. It is feared that it will not be able to arrive in port today, and will have to be postponed until 6:00 pm next Monday to the Wusongkou, and enter the port on the 29th. It is scheduled to dock at the Huangpu Wharf. The ship is carrying 1,048 passengers to Shanghai this time, of which more than 500 are from Hong Kong, and more than 30,260 pieces of cargo, mostly steel and hardware, 45 pieces of mail, and more than 200 pieces of luggage. After arriving in Shanghai, it needs to be repaired again, which will delay it for at least two weeks, so the date of its return to France has not yet been determined. The second "Andelaipeng" postal ship has already departed from France and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on November 22.

### Police Nitpicking - Butchers Request Correction

[Our Newspaper News] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce stated that when slaughtered cattle in the city are transported from the slaughterhouse to the designated vegetable market in trucks, they are often arbitrarily accused by the police on duty of exceeding the limited weight of five tons, and are stopped from passing, or even ordered to drive the entire vehicle and goods into the reweighing station. As a result, there is no overweight issue, but the butchers suffer great losses due to the delay in time and the spoilage of the meat. They have specially requested the Police Bureau to correct this.

### Animal Husbandry Experiment Station Occupies Civilian Farmland - Supervisory Office Urges Relocation and Return

In the Xiajiatang area of Jiangwan, farmers Liu Xikun and others have more than 40 mu of farmland, which they cultivate for a living. After the fall of Shanghai, their land was forcibly occupied by the Japanese to build a military lumber mill. At that time, Liu's father was frightened to death, his wife was brutally killed, and his eldest son was hacked, causing his family to be destroyed and scattered. After the victory, Liu and others returned. In April of this year, they submitted documents and applied to the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau to return the base. After investigation, the Disposal Bureau approved the application and sent a letter to the Central Trust Bureau to take over the enemy-built wooden houses on the land. Unexpectedly, all eight wooden houses were used by the Shanghai Animal Husbandry Experiment Station of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The station claimed that it was allocated by the Shanghai Economic Experiment Farm of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and refused to hand them over, nor did it sign a custody receipt. The Experiment Farm also claimed that it was ordered by the Ministry to take over the farm and had no right to decide, resulting in the Central Trust Bureau being unable to take over. As for Liu Xikun and others, they repeatedly requested the Animal Husbandry Experiment Station to return the base, but the station's attitude was always unreasonable and they had no intention of relocating. The hope of regaining their old business was lost, and the prospect of freezing and starvation was worrying. They specially appealed to the Jiangsu Supervisory Office for a thorough investigation. It is reported that after the office sent personnel to investigate, it has sent a letter to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, ordering the Central Animal Husbandry Experiment Station to relocate the base as soon as possible in order to respect the property rights of the owners. The enemy-built wooden houses on the land should be handed over to the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau and the Central Trust Bureau for takeover and disposal.

### Zhabei Wharf Dispute - Social Bureau Agrees to Re-Arbitrate

[Our Newspaper News] The Zhabei Wharf Trade Union and the Rice Cart Carrying Trade Union had a dispute over business in the past, which was arbitrated by the Social Bureau, and the work was assigned to the Rice Cart Carrying Trade Union. After the wharf workers lost their jobs, they gathered more than 200 people at around 10:00 yesterday morning to obstruct the rice cart carrying workers from carrying rice on the rice boats. The Zhabei Sub-bureau immediately dispatched a large number of long-serving police officers to suppress the incident and ordered them to disperse. However, the wharf coolies refused due to livelihood concerns. The police arrested more than 30 radical elements and took them to the bureau for investigation. Upon receiving the news, the Social Bureau immediately sent Liu Mingqing to discuss the matter with Huang Baisheng and two other representatives of the Wharf Trade Union. Liu agreed to Huang that he would send representatives to the bureau on Monday to apply for re-arbitration by the Social Bureau. As for the more than 30 coolies who were arrested, Liu accompanied the representatives to the sub-bureau to bail them out.

### Inquiring About Matters Concerning the Review and Approval of Graduates from Puppet Provincial Middle Schools

Dear Editor: I am a graduate of the former puppet "Jiangsu Provincial Nanhua Middle School." I was admitted to National Fudan University in July 1945. I read in your newspaper's education news that the Provincial Department of Education has extended the review and approval matters to the end of this month, but I don't know the procedures. I have always admired your column for its aim of serving society, so I specially wrote this letter to ask for your guidance. I am extremely grateful. With best wishes, Reader Ma Tianyuan.

[Answer] Since graduates of puppet middle schools were admitted to national universities last year, the university should submit a request to the Ministry of Education for approval. As for the review and approval procedures of the Jiangsu Department of Education, you can directly inquire with the department in Zhenjiang.

### Post-War Factory Reestablishment Association - Taking Over Enemy and Puppet Factories - Many Difficulties Ahead - Property Rights Disputes, Machines are Damaged, Financial Support from the Government is Needed

[Our Newspaper News] Although the 24 factories purchased or leased by the Post-War Factory Reestablishment Association have been reviewed and approved by the Enemy Property Disposal Bureau, the association has not yet been notified to take over them. From takeover to commencement of work, there are still many difficulties to overcome. First of all, many of these factories have property rights disputes. Especially during the enemy and puppet occupation period, all sales and purchase acts can be used today with the reason of "forced sale" to demand the return of the original property. The witnesses and material evidence between "forced sale" and voluntary transaction are all problematic. Secondly, this batch of factories were not sold at past auctions by the Enemy and Puppet Disposal Bureau. The internal machines are severely damaged. It takes time and money to add finishing touches. According to the estimates of relevant people, the start of work varies according to the nature of each factory, with a minimum of two or three months and a maximum of half a year. The supply of electricity is also a major problem, which will only be solved after the city's power generation increases in two months. Also, those who take over this batch of factories are all small and medium-sized factories in the rear, with limited financial resources. After this journey of relocation, they have spent a lot of money. In the future, when they resume work, they still need the government to provide financial support.

Puppet Division Commander Xie Wenda - High Court Issues Arrest Warrant

[Our Newspaper News] Xie Wenda, the puppet military division commander who led his troops to be stationed in Ningbo during the enemy and puppet period, relied on his evil power to levy taxes and extort money, poisoning the local area. The villagers hated him to the bone. After the victory, the villagers filed a complaint with the Shanghai High Procuratorate to severely punish him, but Xie had already fled and disappeared without a trace. In addition to filing a public prosecution on the case, the High Procuratorate also issued an order yesterday to put Xie Wenda on the wanted list, requesting the District Procuratorate and all relevant parties to arrest him and bring him to justice.

### Converted Rickshaw Tricycle - First One Costs 600,000

[Our Newspaper News] Chen Zhiyao, chairman of the Shanghai Rickshaw Business Association, told reporters yesterday that since the municipal government ordered the rickshaws in the city to stop running and only allow tricycles to run, the association used the original rickshaw bodies to convert them into tricycles for single-person riding, because all the rickshaws will be discarded. The first one has been converted and completed, costing a total of 600,000 yuan. Yesterday, Chen sent the first converted tricycle to the Bureau of Public Utilities for inspection. The Bureau of Public Utilities instructed to submit drawings for verification. It is reported that the bureau has now designed another type of tricycle, but the drawings will not be fully completed in four or five days. The bureau will compare these two types of drawings and check whether they are safe before deciding whether to allow them to run.

### Impressions of Visiting Bai Jiao's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition: Returning to Simplicity After Splendor, Melancholy and Indignation Overflowing from the Words

[Special Report by This Newspaper] People say that Mr. Bai Jiao, a native of Zhenjian, is excellent in calligraphy, painting, and seal carving. However, after visiting his recent calligraphy and painting exhibition at the Ningbo Native Place Association yesterday, I felt that Mr. Bai Jiao's alternative names were also good, and his poems were even better. Why? I would answer that Mr. Bai Jiao is a person of genuine emotions. Although he wanted to hide himself with madness, he could not conceal his enthusiasm everywhere. Although he was unwilling to say much about national affairs, look at the kind of ecstasy he showed when he heard that the enemy had surrendered! And for his children, in the three long poems "Remember Ah Hong, Ah Yi, Ah Lian," he was even more deeply affectionate, and he simply perfected the plain style of writing poems!

As early as around 1927, I knew of Mr. Bai Jiao, although he probably did not use the name "Bai Jiao" much at that time. At that time, his heroic spirit was overwhelming, and his blood was boiling. In the past ten years or so, it has been suppressed and become pieces of orchid petals. Even Bai Jiao talks about Zen now! After the extreme of splendor, he has gradually returned to simplicity, but his melancholy and indignation still flow between the lines everywhere. He is still condemning; when monsters and freaks were running rampant, he said, "If I don't see France, the old man will die like Pétain!" It's a pity that he didn't know at the time that Pétain hadn't died.

Bai Jiao paints orchids and bamboos, but not pine and cypress, so even large central scrolls have the atmosphere of small pieces. Bai Jiao writes characters with the brush used for painting orchids and bamboos, and the delicate beauty is compelling. But it is precisely because he does not paint pine and cypress that the vigorousness is inevitably flawed. In couplets, there are often cases where every character is good, but there is only one bad stroke, which makes people sigh endlessly. The characters also have the atmosphere of small pieces, so the square inch regular script is the most wonderful, and the cursive script shows shortness of breath. However, writing long inscriptions in small characters really has the atmosphere of the Jin people.

Bai Jiao's theory of calligraphy is that Zhao's characters are like prostitutes and Dong's characters are not chaste women, which is naturally quite reasonable. However, Bai Jiao's characters are still ultimately orchids, not pine and cypress. There are really too few materials for the pillars of China.

Bai Jiao is an expert in researching Yuan Shikai. The historical materials of the Hongxian period that he continuously published in the "Renwen" magazine in those years were very precious. People today do not talk about Yuan Shikai; if they do, all the references come from this. In recent years, I don't know what this "　Wang" has been doing? In a small screen, he wrote a passage from Zhuge Wuhou's letter, and in the postscript, he said that the original letter belonged to Yuan Hanyun, but he used "Yuan Shikai stole the country" as the beginning, which was written magnificently! However, Bai Jiao's楹聯 (楹聯 - couplets written on scrolls) have gradually contained more loyal and honest words in recent years. The 聯 (聯 - couplets) collected from Song lyrics that he used to write are almost impossible to see again. It would be better if he could "seek clumsiness" again, and it would be best if he could make "clumsiness" not "sought."

### Detailed Measures for the Third Phase of Yarn Allocation Have Been Drafted, the Cotton Spinning Industry Has Also Set Up Three Small Group Meetings, and the Schedule of Yarn Allocation and Price Negotiation Tables Have Been Announced

[Report from This Newspaper] The price negotiation for the third phase of cotton yarn allocation was decided at a meeting convened by Chairman Wu of the Textile Control Commission on the 23rd of this month. The negotiated price for 20-count cotton yarn is 1.75 million yuan. According to Liu Wen, Director of the Business Department of the Commission, to the reporter: The other counts of yarn have also been calculated proportionally and have been sent to the Spinning Construction Company and the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association for its members to check. The negotiated prices for each count of cotton yarn are as follows: 20 count, 1.75 million yuan; 10 count, 1.53 million yuan; 12 count, 1.58 million yuan; 16 count, 1.62 million yuan; 32 count, 2.32 million yuan; 32 count double strand, 2.61 million yuan; 40 count, 2.77 million yuan; 42 count, 2.77 million yuan; 42 count double strand, 2.79 million yuan.

In addition, the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association convened a general meeting of members a few days ago. In addition to deciding on the allocation of yarn for each yarn factory and drafting six simple rules for the third phase of yarn allocation, it also formed three committees for raw materials, price negotiation, and distribution. The list of members of each committee: Raw Materials Committee: Dong Yunzhang, Rong Yixin, Dong Chunfang, Huang Shoumin, Liu Piji. Price Negotiation Committee: Wang Qiyu, Wu Kunsheng, Jiang Dixian, Guo Dihuo, Cheng Jingtang, Tang Xinghai. Distribution Committee: Wu Weijing, Liu Jingji, Tong Runfu, Gu Dingji, Guo Qiong, Cheng Runsheng.

Yesterday, the Price Negotiation Committee convened a special meeting to discuss and approve a price negotiation table for each count of cotton yarn, which was reported to the Textile Control Commission for approval (price negotiation see above). In addition to sending the price negotiation table to each member for verification, the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association also sent another letter stating: It is understood that the authorities are determined to eliminate the black market and suppress yarn prices in this distribution of cotton yarn. Each factory must cooperate fully and conduct its own inspections. For the remaining amount of yarn outside of the distributed yarn, each factory must strictly abide by the negotiated price when selling it, which is what we hope for.

A total of 36 private factories are allocating yarn in the third phase. The allocation is based on the actual number of spindles opened by each factory in July, with 20-count yarn as the standard. If each factory sells other counts, it will be calculated according to the following ratios: 10 count, 187.5%; 16 count, 125%; 20 count, 100%; 32 count, 75%; 42 count, 60%. It is found that the total amount of yarn to be allocated by each private factory is 8,003 pieces, which will be allocated in two batches. The first batch should be 4,002 pieces, and the second batch should be 4,001 pieces. The total amount of yarn allocated to each factory is led by Shenxin No. 9 Factory with 980 pieces. Second is Shenxin No. 2 Factory with 480 pieces, and third is Tongyi Yarn Factory with 444 pieces. After that are Shenxin No. 1 Factory with 375 pieces, Shenxin No. 6 Factory with 373 pieces, Yong'an No. 3 and No. 4 Factories, each with 357 pieces, Xin Yu No. 2 Factory with 330 pieces, and Xinhe Yarn Factory with 305 pieces. The least is He Feng and Qin Feng Yarn Factories, each with 36 pieces.

Simple Rules for the Third Phase of Cotton Yarn Allocation

(1) The total amount of yarn allocated this time is 12,004.5 pieces, of which state-owned factories account for one-third, which is 4,001.5 pieces, and private factories account for two-thirds, which is 8,003 pieces (the amount of yarn allocated to each private factory is listed in a separate allocation table). (2) Each factory will allocate the yarn in two batches according to the allocation table (i.e., Monday, October 28 and Monday, November 4). Every Monday, each factory shall prepare a form listing the counts, trademarks, and prices of each type of cotton yarn and submit it to the association. (3) Each factory shall calculate the yarn price based on 1.75 million yuan per piece for 20 count yarn as the standard. (4) When each factory submits the yarn allocation form, it shall also submit the reservation forms for various cotton yarns (this reservation form is for customers to exchange the warehouse receipt for the price paid to the factory with the reservation form. Five pieces per sheet for 20 count yarn, one piece per sheet for yarn above 20 count) together to the association. (5) The association will submit the yarn allocation table of each factory to the "Reproduction Association Joint Office" (the joint office jointly established by the six reproduction associations, hereinafter referred to as the Joint Office) on Monday afternoon. The Joint Office will allocate the members and customers according to the distribution, and create a table listing the name of the yarn purchaser, the factory purchased from, the count and type of cotton yarn purchased, and its price, and submit it to the association by Wednesday. The association will issue the reservation forms based on the table. (6) The Joint Office will distribute the reservation forms to customers upon receipt. Customers are limited to exchange the reservation forms and prepare the payment to the factory for the warehouse receipt on Thursday and clear the yarn within ten days.

### Public Bonds Stabilize

The public price situation is mediocre, the demand and supply are still scattered, the Silk Industry Bank has made slight progress, the process is stable, and the turnover has reached 5 million yuan. Tongbing opened at 2020 yuan, and once rose to around 2090 yuan. Finally, it still hovered around 2050 yuan. As a result, it closed slightly higher than the previous day by 20 yuan, Yiyou was down slightly by 20 yuan, Dingzhong was flat, and Wuzhong was down slightly by 30 yuan.

### Raw Silk Standards Determined, 77 Points Listed as Grade D

[Report from This Newspaper] The joint meeting of relevant agencies the other day has made a decision on the grade issue of raw silk purchased.

This standard is the same as Japan's and one point lower than the United States'. However, according to silk industry experts, the inspection standards of the Commodity Inspection Bureau are quite high. Those listed as Grade D in our country may be upgraded abroad. There have been many such cases in the past. This decision has fully taken into account the interests of producers.

### Extramural Influence Intramural... Bulls Buy Up Yong Yarn

Yesterday, several bullish companies launched an offensive in the Hua stock market, buying Yong Yarn heavily extramurally. Intramurally, they first sold and then bought, gradually recovering after weakness. At the morning opening, each stock showed slight prosperity, but soon No. 104 came to sell forcefully, and Yong Yarn took the lead in retreating slightly, and each stock followed suit. The new low price was created by Jingfu. However, the news that the bullish company was aggressively entering extramurally had spread throughout the intramural, and people's hearts became optimistic, and the market recovered repeatedly. After 11:30, the bullish company made every effort to transfer the chips released in the intramural at high prices. As a result, Yong Yarn rose to a high price of 753 yuan, and Xinhe was also brought up, while the rest were relatively stable. Near noon, the bulls and bears fought fiercely, rising and falling suddenly, and struggling fiercely. Qinxing also took the opportunity to end at a high price, while the rest of the stocks were just so-so.

### Machinery Mortgages Are Difficult to Implement

Still Emphasizing Raw Materials and Finished Products

[Report from This Newspaper] Since the Four Joint Offices issued the mortgage loan measures, there have been some improvements on the whole, but the reporter learned from relevant parties that the collateral is still based on raw materials and finished products. Because there are too many problems with machinery mortgages; first, the performance and types of machines are extremely complicated and cannot be identified without experts; second, machines have the problem of depreciation. The so-called depreciation can be divided into two categories: one is the consumption caused by the use of machines, and the other is the elimination of old-fashioned machines due to the invention and use of new weapons machines; these are all issues that should be considered when handling mortgages. As for the date of implementation of the new measures, the Shanghai branch has not heard of it.

Bao Shu, Director of the Loan Group Committee of the Four Joint Offices, has taken office as Director of the Executive Yuan Headquarters and is unable to take care of both. He has firmly requested to resign. The headquarters has now appointed Lin Fengbao, Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, as the concurrent post. The group meeting on the 26th will be chaired by Lin.

### Yarn Market Shows Slight Firmness in Fine Counts and Flatness in Coarse Counts, with the Greatest Fluctuations in Double Strands

Yesterday, the yarn market was slightly firm in fine counts and flat in coarse counts. Customer sales were still not enthusiastic, and people's hearts were also very mediocre. The fluctuations in 42-count double-strand thread were extremely large. At the beginning, there were rumors that the Textile Control Commission would allocate 6,000 pieces to practical manufacturers next Monday, and the yarn merchants sold at lower prices due to false rumors. For example, 42-count Blue Phoenix once fell to 2.33 million yuan. Then, there were many people buying at low prices, and the price rose slowly. The closing price rebounded to 3.5 million yuan, which was 100,000 yuan higher than yesterday. 20-count yarn was only up by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and 16-count yarn was as sluggish as ever, and the price was down slightly by 20,000 yuan.

### Sugar Has Substitutes, Sweetness is 4,000 Times Higher

[United Press Chicago, 25th] Professor Bierde of Denver University revealed today that he has invented a sugar substitute that is 4,000 times sweeter than sucrose, and the Netherlands is currently starting production. He said that this product is extracted from asphalt and is 10 to 20 times sweeter than saccharin.

### Relaxed Monetary Policy and Gold Prices Rise... Foreign Currencies Also Became Popular

### U.S. Cotton Crop Failure, At Most 8.2 Million Bales, World Consumption Increases

[Reuters Washington, 25th] Texas Agriculture Commissioner McDonald predicts that this year's cotton harvest will be one of the smallest since 1888.

McDonald said that the Department of Agriculture has requested to plant 24 million acres of cotton in the coming season, but to get this number, cotton prices must be maintained at least at the level of 40 cents per pound.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's recently published "Cotton Supply Overview," the world supply of commercial cotton for this year is estimated at 42 million bales, 7 million bales less than the highest record in 1939, and 5 million bales less than the average supply from 1935 to 1939. But this year's consumption may increase by 19% compared to last year.

### High Costs and Merchant Hesitation: The Decline of the Peppermint Oil Business, Farmers Face Losses Selling Oil

According to insiders in the peppermint industry, the golden age of China's peppermint business was between the 26th and 30th years of the Republic [1937-1941]. It is said that only China and Japan produced peppermint in the world. During that period, China's labor costs were lower than Japan's, and the quality of its products was far superior. Therefore, exports flourished. The annual export volume of menthol exceeded two million pounds. At that time, the export price was about US$9 to US$10 per pound, and the purchase price of peppermint crude oil was about the price of one dan [a unit of dry measure] of rice per jin [unit of weight]. Farmers were happy to plant and refine oil because of the high profits, resulting in a remarkably abundant yield. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, foreign ships stopped coming to China, and the export of peppermint oil came to a halt. As a result, market prices plummeted. Farmers stopped planting one after another. However, domestic stocks were still relatively abundant, and the supply was not felt to be scarce. Especially after the war, various small and medium-sized new pharmaceutical factories, toothpaste factories, and tooth powder factories were established, so the sales channels became more active, and the annual sales volume gradually increased to more than 30,000 pounds. After the victory, with the hope of restoring exports, manufacturers launched activities to purchase crude oil from various producing areas, and farmers in various producing areas also began planting silk cocoons. Unexpectedly, the market price of peppermint crude oil was only more than 10,000 yuan per jin, while the fuel required by farmers to refine crude oil now costs 7,000 to 8,000 yuan per jin, and labor costs also require more than 3,000 yuan. The price that merchants or manufacturers can pay to farmers is only about 10,000 yuan per jin. Therefore, farmers who produce oil end up losing money, and merchants are unwilling to transport it because there is no profit to be made. Therefore, the lotus industry, which had just begun to rise, has suffered a setback and is on the verge of death.

### City Chamber of Commerce: Supporting the Timber Industry, Requesting Reduced Shipping Costs from Shipping Companies, and Requesting the Railway Bureau to Use Domestic Products

### Fertilizer Prices Fall: Bu Nei Men Distributes Large Quantities

Yongli goods have also fallen from 1.7 million yuan to 1.2 million yuan. Saltpeter was temporarily in short supply due to the lack of sulfuric acid, and saltpeter became the only substitute. Its price rose from 800,000 yuan per ton to 1.8 million yuan, but has now fallen to 1.3 million yuan.

### More Orders Placed with England

According to import and export industry authorities, recently, general manufacturers in the city have been reducing their orders from the United States, while orders for industrial raw materials and various machines from England have been gradually increasing. It is reported that a British ship recently arrived with a large number of Austin cars and various radios.

He then met with a special correspondent from this newspaper in Suzhou and made a statement: Jiangsu Province's education has a five-year plan. He believes that elementary school is the foundation of all education, so three years out of the five years will be spent on popularizing the establishment of national schools. Regarding educational administration, it has been decided that on December 1st, education bureaus will be fully established in the first and second-class counties of Jiangnan to strengthen the work force. A literacy movement will also be actively launched throughout the province to meet the needs of constitutional implementation. A special fund for literacy movement subsidies will be added to the education budget for the next year. Regarding teacher salaries, it has been decided that starting in October, the salaries of county-level teachers will be raised to the same level as those of provincial-level teachers. However, the four counties of Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Xishan are exceptions due to central government regulations, so the provincial level will still be slightly higher than the county level. However, the increase in this new standard will only be issued after the land tax is collected in kind. When the reporter inquired about the current situation of education in the recovered counties of northern Jiangsu, Chen said: When the Communist army controlled northern Jiangsu, it severely damaged education. The Huaiyin Agricultural School, which was very large in scale and had a good reputation, was completely destroyed. He has now applied to the central government for a special fund of 800 million yuan as a preparatory fund for the educational rehabilitation of the counties in northern Jiangsu that have been restored. When the reporter inquired about the proportion of the education budget, Chen replied: There is no specific regulation from the central government, but Jiangsu Province accounts for more than 30% of the total budget, and we hope to increase it further in the future. It is learned that Chen will stay in Suzhou for another day and will return to the provincial capital tomorrow (the 27th).

As a result, Hequn defeated the Youyou veterans by a score of 2 to 1. Only five minutes after the start of the game, Zhang Ting of Hequn swept in a goal, opening the record. Youyou counterattacked, and Hu Youcheng returned a goal, but it was not counted because it was offside. At 30 minutes, Mao Hongfa took a corner kick, the landing point was excellent, and Lei Shuping headed it in, Youyou tied the score.

### Guozhen Cup Volleyball Finals: Soviet Union Wins Men's Championship, After a Fierce Five-Set Battle, Huayan Wins First and Loses Later, In the Women's Group, Friends United Defeats Friends in Four Sets

[Reported by this newspaper] In the Guozhen Cup Volleyball Tournament, the Soviet Union defeated Huayan by a score of 3 to 2 in the final last night, winning the men's championship. It was a pity that Huayan won first and lost later. The competition was fierce. The scores of the five sets were as follows: 19 to 21, 21 to 17, 19 to 21, 21 to 15, 21 to 18. In the women's group, Friends United defeated the Friends team last night with a stable and pure performance. After the Friends team won the first game with a score of 14 to 21, Friends United led all the way in the next three games. The Friends team tried hard to catch up, but all efforts failed. The scores were as follows: 14 to 21, 21 to 12, 24 to 22, 24 to 22. Chen Meizhen was the soul of the entire Friends United team, both in attack and defense. The Friends team seemed to have poor communication. Huang Mingyuan's spikes were often wild balls. However, although the Friends team lost, it protested after the game, saying that Friends United was 12 minutes late and should be forfeited, but the referee ordered the start of the game, so it is unknown how this will be explained. After the game, awards were given. Wang Weijun represented the mayor in giving the awards. The championship trophy for the women's group is temporarily reserved. Awards were also given at the same time for the first league. The champion of the men's first division, Huayan, received the Qian Dajun Silver Cup, and the champion of the women's division, Friends United, received the Qian Jianqiu Silver Cup.

### Exploring Ancient Anyang - Record of the Excavation of Shang Dynasty Sacrificial Vessels

— Dispatch from Anyang, 18th. Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi of this newspaper

History tells us that after Pan Geng, the Shang people no longer migrated nomadically but began agricultural settlement. To establish a permanent life based on agriculture, Pan Geng led his subjects to relocate from Yan (in present-day Qufu, Shandong) to Gu, residing on the bank of the Huan River. This was the place where their former kings had lived.

The historical atmosphere of Anyang is too rich. The excavation of oracle bone inscriptions made the name of Xiaotun in Anyang known to the world. The brilliant Shang Dynasty culture is gradually accumulated into a strong impression from the unearthed antiquities, and engraved in our minds. Now running to this ancient city in northern Henan, apart from taking the train, it is simply inconvenient to walk around the suburbs. During the time of King Zhou of Shang, it is said in history that his detached palaces and villas extended south to Chaoge and north to Handan Shaqiu, showing the progress of civil engineering at that time. The agricultural settlement of over two hundred years from Pan Geng to King Zhou was the first era of wealth accumulation in Chinese history. Under the dual conditions of stability and wealth, Shang Dynasty culture achieved amazing accomplishments. But the current city in northern Henan is a city of soldiers, a city of battles. Naturally, it has been a famous military stronghold since ancient times. Xiang Yu broke cauldrons and sank boats to attack Zhao, leading his troops from here to meet with Qin's Zhang Han at Yin Xu on the bank of the Zhang River, which is also Anyang. But this is not enough to be proud of, because Chinese history can do without Xiang Yu or Liu Bang, but not without the people who inscribed oracle bones and cast bronze ware. The reporter finally couldn't help but ignore any advice or admonitions and, in the capacity of a Chinese, ventured to walk around the suburbs, because other Chinese people could walk, and even foreign missionaries could, so why couldn't I?

Anyang lacks livestock, and farm women have to work like oxen. (Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi)

### Catalyst for National Revival - Still "Mediating Without Contact" for Decades

During my week in Anyang, I "toured" four times, each time following the Huan River, now called the Anyang River. The first time was to Yuan Shikai's tomb on the north bank of the Huan River; the second time was to Qugou, where a battle had just taken place and where battles could occur at any time; the other two times were to Xiaotun (Yin Xu). If I couldn't go to Xiaotun after arriving in Anyang, I would have endless regrets. Cole, the former American representative of the Military Mediation Team, secretly went there alone once, when the situation was much more tense than it is now. Upon his return, he was kindly blamed, but he had gained something, having bought several pieces of oracle bones with inscriptions from the residents, which made him very satisfied.

There are still many oracle bones scattered among the people. Using antiques to exchange for money was invented by Chinese scholar-officials long ago, so can you blame these residents? One local person even told me that before the war, his family's oracle bones were packed in burlap sacks, and they had been moved around for eight years, but now he didn't know where they had gone. In Anyang, there are quite a few gentry who consider themselves refined and collect oracle bones or other antiques as family heirlooms, keeping them deeply hidden. In times when guns are more important than everything else, scholarship is bound to be neglected. Guo Moruo believed that studying these antiques was indeed a "catalyst" for national revival. I feel that our "catalyst," after decades of exploration by scholars, has indeed yielded considerable results, but it is ultimately mediating without contact, and our nation still cannot grasp the key. Antiques are kept, locked away, and traded in Chinese society, and their own fate is very pitiful. Just looking at the Anyang County Antiquities Preservation Office is saddening. Every item here is covered in dust. Yin Gui (wine vessel), Yin Gu (another kind of wine vessel), are casually discarded in a glass case. There are only a few dozen small pieces of oracle bones, and none of them have inscriptions, except for one piece with the characters "Gui Jia." There are also several pieces of bone artifacts (fish bones) and a bone arrowhead in the dusty cabinet. Those bone fragments and pottery shards seem to be about to be buried in the soil again. Another large hall is filled with Ming Dynasty sculptures, stone Buddhas, Song Dynasty iron Buddhas, as well as roof tiles, bricks, Han steles, and Wei steles – a pile of miscellaneous goods. The iron Buddhas and stone statues that don't fit are placed in the courtyard, exposed to the sun, night dew, and rain. Recently, a Shang Dynasty sacrificial vessel (I will introduce it in a special article) was transported from Wuguan Village and placed in the center, making the preservation office look like a Sanqing Hall without monks. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, antiques weighing about two tons were packed in boxes and transported to Nanyang. They have now been transported back, and it is said that nothing was lost. These former front-door sign crates are still thrown on the ground, not yet opened. There has been no investigation into how much the enemy took away from here after the war. It has been muddled along from the beginning and continues to be muddled.

### Visiting Yuan Shikai's Tomb Amidst the Thundering of Cannons

On the 14th, I went to the area five li north of the city, with Yuan Shikai's tomb as the destination, to avoid going too far. I had asked the local people whether I would run into the Communist area if I wandered around. They replied that it was possible, "but you can easily tell." This person said, "If the village has blockhouses, the stockade is well-built, and there are soldiers guarding posts, then it is a place with National soldiers. The first thing the Eighth Route Army does when they enter a village is to tear down the blockhouses, flatten the stockade, and there are no rules for guarding posts, only a few people are sent to squat by the roadside or in the flower fields."

As soon as I reached the suburbs, the thundering of cannons became very clear, coming from the northeast. The cannon fire had been going on for more than a dozen hours. The military said this was common, and the locals said it was even more lively a week ago. Five li north of the city is the Huan River, and there is an Anyang Bridge on it that can accommodate four large trucks side by side. Before there was a railway, this was originally the main route to the north. Anyang was built in the Yuan Dynasty and called the Whale Back Bridge. It has a history of seven hundred years and was only blown up two holes during this War of Resistance, sacrificing itself in the ethnic liberation war. The water of the Huan River is so shallow and clear that you can't see that this was once a place where ancient giant reptiles roamed. On the northwest bank of the bridge is Cuihu Village, where Yuan Shikai is buried. It is said that it was a "national" funeral at the time, complete with a stele pavilion, pavilions, stone figures, and stone archways. Among the stone figures, some wear ancient ceremonial clothing and others wear Beiyang military uniforms, which is truly incongruous. A person whose country was not successfully established was still given a "national funeral," which is also an incredible thing. The stone tablet in the stele pavilion reads: "Tomb of the Late President Yuan Gong Shikai." Although he was not an emperor, he was still a president. The construction project lasted for two years, and its magnificence was completely incomparable to the dilapidated village houses. Now, a company of soldiers is stationed here, with bullet holes in the glazed walls and fortifications being built. A bunker has been built on top of the tomb. Is this not disrespectful to the "national" funeral? It is truly a comical interlude in modern history.

### The Sight of Building Stockades on Flat Ground is Breathtaking

It wasn't until I visited the western suburbs of Anyang that I saw the greatness of the defense works. The blockhouses along the Jinpu and Jinghu Railways cannot compare. To put it simply, this is a city. They are all built around individual villages, which the locals call "stockades." Some are simply built on flat ground, with houses built inside and wells dug. The perimeter is surrounded by one or two moats, and then enclosed with barbed wire. These moats are up to two zhang deep and one zhang five chi wide, dug extremely steep, and it is impossible to climb out if you fall in. One square city is one hundred meters long and wide, the largest one, built entirely from flat ground. The manpower, wood, and wheat straw were all requisitioned from the local area. It is conceivable how much burden the common people bear. According to local estimates, "thirty billion won't be enough." This refers to the fortifications already built in Anyang.

These earthen walls, up to one zhang five chi high, are built entirely of mud mixed with chopped wheat straw. Every village has one. If one village is developed after another, less than ten thousand villages would be enough to build a Great Wall. The Great Wall in those years was just an earthen wall, and the carts of corvée labor at that time have long been recorded in history. Today, the burden of these works in one corner of northern Henan is also becoming a Great Wall.

When the Communist army leaves, they take all the supplies, and the farmers are also mobilized. What remains are dilapidated houses. The land has already been distributed, and the people who got the land are being asked to join the army in various ways, to take up arms against the government, saying they are protecting their land, protecting the "fruits of their liberation." Some people say: The reason they divided the land to us wasn't to have us farm, but to have us join the army and fight. Anyway, there is no way to complain. The farmers think, how can they leave the land? They quietly return, only to see dilapidated houses, not even plows, so they have to sit on the rubble and cry, blaming their bad luck. Now they have to do corvée labor to build the stockades, saying it is to protect their homeland. On a piece of land that has been sown, because of the lack of animal power, a woman with bound feet is dragging a stone roller to compress the soil. You see in this photo, she is simply working herself like an ox.

In the area west of Qugou, the masses simply cannot go to harvest, as bullets do not recognize people. They cannot go during the day, and even less at night, because firefights often happen at night. In the western plain of Anyang, it is now the time for cotton to ripen. Some local troops want to take 60 percent, saying, "Without us, could you harvest it?" It is reasonable to take it. It is said that there is a special agency in the city. This is truly a special place. Standing on the stockade and looking out at these areas that cannot be harvested, I see no one coming or going, and cotton is scattered all over the ground. Two li away is the Communist village. Bales of cotton are transported south from Anyang truck after truck. You will not see the specks of blood and tears of the northern Henan farmers on them.

During the Warring States period, Ximen Bao governed Ye (present-day Anyang), diverting water from the Zhang River to create canals to benefit agriculture. During the Tang Dynasty, the Wanjin Canal was opened, which irrigated the western part of Anyang. For thousands of years, the land here has been fertile. Now, because of the war, the Communist army has blocked the canal opening on the Heng River, so there is no water here. Yellow soil cannot store water, and without water, it is close to becoming a desert. This kind of yellow soil is also very good, easy to dig and cut, and able to build fortifications so beautifully and solidly.

### Xiaotun's First Journey, a Small Village Known Around the World

Xiaotun and its surrounding areas, perhaps due to "strategic" considerations, have not been fortified with stockades. The people of Xiaotun proudly say: "The people here are all educated, and not a single one has joined the Eighth Route Army." I went there twice on the 17th and 18th. This small village, known around the world, has only twenty-odd households with the surnames He, Huo, and Zhang, with more than two hundred residents. Many middle-aged people asked me with concern about Mr. Dong Zuobin and Mr. Li Ji, asking where they were now. They clearly remembered the situations when the Academia Sinica sent Dong to excavate several times between 1918 and 1921, with more than a thousand workers involved, and schools were even held in the evenings. Dong explained oracle bone inscriptions to them, telling them the true significance of excavating antiquities. The people of Xiaotun understand this very well, and some farmers even recognize oracle bone characters. A farmer who used to cook for the excavation team introduced me to an old man to buy a royal vessel, saying, "You can take it back with you, it is indeed from the Three Dynasties." He used the foreign term "Three Dynasties." I also obtained a piece of cloth-patterned pottery, a piece of black pottery with an animal head, a bone awl, ten fragments of oracle bones, and a bronze axe. Their purpose was to exchange them for some money, but they also happily believed that I was someone who "knew" things. They often find some broken pieces at home to sell.

Dong established a school for the people of Xiaotun. They all lamented this, thinking that if there hadn't been a war, this school would have been great if it had been run until now. It is said that the school also taught oracle bone inscription classes, which was quite scholarly. Some residents have a surprising knowledge of antiquities. They understand the excavation methods and recognize the age of the soil. They said that the Japanese in the city had wanted to come and dig, but they didn't know where to start, so it was concluded that "these people haven't done any research, they just want to get rich. If they had done research, wouldn't they know where to dig?"

These farmers commonly suffer from eye diseases and malnutrition. The eyes of a young boy had already gone blind. The children are generally thin and emaciated, eating sorghum rice without vegetables, dropping a large bowl of yellow sorghum rice with their small hands and squatting on the muddy ground to eat. Each household bears the burden of corvée labor, contributing burial materials, bran, wheat, and money, costing tens of thousands of yuan a month. If they could buy some eggs and meat with this money, the young boy might not have gone blind.

The farmer who had cooked for the excavation team asked me, "The Academia Sinica should be coming back now, right?" He pointed to the cotton field by the Huan River, saying that six large turtle shells were found there and transported away with the soil. We walked along the bank of the Huan River, and he told me everywhere what had been found in a certain place. He became my archeology professor. They recalled the life of three to five cents a day they lived for during excavation, as if it were a dream. Thinking of the life of fifteen years ago, seeing me, an unexpected guest, they associated it with the Academia Sinica, saying, "The Academia Sinica should be coming back now, right?"

### Recently Excavated Sacrificial Furnace - Covered with Green Rust, Full of Ancient Charm

After arriving in Anyang, I met with the Secretary-General of the Anyang County Government, who talked about a recently unearthed ancient vessel. Because I had heard about this vessel, I wanted to investigate it thoroughly after arriving in Anyang. He told me that it was a furnace, weighing over a thousand catties, and that there was some entanglement involved. It is said that the person who "presented" this ancient vessel was not entirely the original owner. He was a traitor during the Japanese occupation of Anyang and wanted to use this to cleanse himself. But others involved with this vessel were figures from the War of Resistance, and their purpose was not about ownership, but they were reluctant to have this person come forward to "present" it. The Secretary-General said that our government doesn't care, and whoever "presents" it is fine. The government, of course, has only one word: accept. It is said that this ancient vessel was unearthed as early as 1939. It was too big and heavy, so it was quietly reburied. When the news leaked out, the Japanese were willing to buy it for 70,000 puppet yuan, but they did not succeed. It is said that a smaller piece was sent out, but the larger piece was preserved thanks to a "sense of national pride." But what that smaller piece was is unknown. The excavation site is in Wuguan Village, on the north bank of this river, about seven li northwest of Anyang. This area is still unstable today. This past July, the county government asked the local garrison to provide cover to cross the Huan River and rush to transport it over.

About two li southeast of the south bank of Wuguan Village is Yin Tan, which is Xiaotun today. The Academia Sinica had excavated in both places. The excavation site of this ancient vessel is near the tomb of He Jia Ling, (He Jia directed the excavation here and obtained many vessels. Refer to the report of the Academia Sinica, Commercial Press edition.) After being transported to the city, it was placed in the Antiquities Preservation Office.

Structure

This vessel is three chi and two cun high and one chi and two cun wide. It has two ears and four legs. The weight is unknown. Each side is about half an inch thick. It is made of bronze. Looking at the color of the copper, the quality is quite pure. This is a sacrificial vessel. In oracle bone inscriptions, 子 is written as 祄, 子 means the first month, because the first month is mainly for sacrifices, so the character 子 became the pictograph of sacrificial vessels. Looking at the shape of this vessel and comparing it with oracle bone inscriptions, it becomes clear at a glance. The oracle bone inscription character 子 looks like 你. It is clear that the square shapes from the Yin sacrificial vessel drawing are all available, and this one is rectangular.

The entire vessel can be divided into eleven parts: four sides, one bottom, four legs, and two ears. The two ears were soldered on. One ear has completely detached from the solder, and is currently still buried in the soil. One ear shown in the photo is detached at one end from the solder and broken at the other, and is also completely separated from the vessel itself. It is temporarily attached during photography. If the copper shavings from the joint could be taken for chemical analysis, it may be possible to know the soldering method used at that time. This detached ear is actually very stable when placed back on, completely in the center of gravity.

As for the vessel itself, there are no signs of soldering. The four legs are hollow and connected to the bottom of the vessel. Looking into the vessel from above, four round holes can be seen at the four corners of the vessel. The ears are also hollow.

The entire body is covered with mottled green rust, full of ancient charm. Hardened soil, in the form of grains and flakes, has chemically reacted with the copper body, firmly adhering to the copper. It cannot be shaken loose with fingers.

Patterns

The ears, legs, and sides have relief patterns. It is not accurate to say that they are entirely carved. They were mostly carved when the mold was made, and then scraped and modified after casting. The ears have patterns on three sides, but not on the inside. The legs have patterns all around. The bottom of the vessel has two sets of rough raised lines, intersecting to form a "ten" shape, and the bottom of the vessel forms a "出" shape.

The engraved patterns can be roughly divided into three layers. One layer is the background pattern, the second layer is 饕餮, and the third layer is the engraved pattern on the relief. In many places, the edges and corners of the cuts are very prominent.

Now, let's assume that the pattern of this vessel is 饕餮. The basic background pattern is the 回纹 pattern, in the shape of 饕餮. I have seen pottery shards with 回龙纹 patterns. This time, I obtained a square pottery shard with a 回龙纹 pattern in Yin Xu. The 回龙纹 is very neat, showing that the 回龙纹 pattern was commonly used by the Yin people. Is the oracle bone inscription "亘" (river) 昝, a pictographic representation of the Huan River producing a dragon? The third layer is also a 回龙纹, or a simplified 回龙纹.

The four corners of the vessel are raised with four ridges, and each leg is also raised with a ridge. The upper and lower parts of each side of the vessel are raised with a ridge, which are also 饕餮 patterns.

There are six complete dragons and four dragon heads on each side in relief. The two dragons on the ears are obviously different. One ear has a round horn, and the third layer of纹 is strong, with straight lines. For now, let's call it Dragon A. The other ear has a sharp horn, and the third layer of纹 has softer lines. For now, let's call it Dragon B. Looking at the two ears together, it is a human head (also in relief). Perhaps this is a male and a female.

The two complete dragons on the upper edge of the vessel's sides are all Dragon A; the two complete dragons on the lower edge are all Dragon B, (but the basic 土 of the third layer of纹 is all 回龙纹, different from Dragon A). Although the four dragon heads at the four corners are all Dragon B, the two dragon heads on the upper corners each have an extra "horn." This point differentiates them from Dragons A and B, so let's call them Dragon C.

As shown in the picture, there is a dragon head with horns below the lower end of the ear and the edge of the vessel, which is the Dragon C with horns on the side of the vessel.

As for the four dragons on the four legs, they are all Dragon B.

This time, I also obtained a black pottery shard with a small animal head in Xiaotun. After bringing it back and checking, I realized that it was exactly two dragons.

The relief in the upper left corner of one side of this vessel is damaged. If it was not damaged during reproduction, it was burned in a large fire, or perhaps the latter is more credible, because the two dragon heads near the ear and leg have not desoldered, only broken. Or, the solder joint may have melted in high heat, thus making it solid. The other leg and the two legs of the other ear, however, are desoldered.

Interpretation

This vessel has an inscription, located in the center of the inside of the vessel. It is the oracle bone inscription "后妻戊" (Hou Qi Wu) in intaglio. The edges and corners of the engraving are very clear, and the depth is more than one cun. It cannot be done with iron tools, so this vessel must be from the end of the Yin Dynasty. Perhaps this can even serve as evidence that the Yin Dynasty had iron tools.

The three characters "后妻戊" are actually two characters. Yin oracle bone inscriptions often have the habit of writing names together, such as Bao Bing, Bao Yi, and Da Yi (Tang). Like the Yin people's names: Father Ding, Brother Geng, are often written as one unit. These names are a whole concept, so it is very natural to write them as one unit.

This "Qi Wu," like the examples of Father Ding and Brother Geng, means that this lady's original name was "Wu." At this time, she became Hou Qi. Her husband (one of the Yin kings) had this sacrificial vessel - this large bronze rice bowl - cast to worship her and commemorate her. Now I don't know which Yin king's wife "Qi Wu" was. I only brought a pen and ran to Anyang. If I could look up the books and find out, then the exact date of the vessel could be calculated.

My other non-conforming thought is: If the so-called Hou Qi is what her children and grandchildren called her, then "Qi Wu" may have meant "Madam Wu" or "Mrs. Wu." "Hou Qi Wu" could even be read as "Hou Wu Qi," but there is no example to support this, as there is above. Among the Yin kings after Tang, there was one called Da Wu, the fourth generation after Tang. Da Wu was a capable ruler in the early Shang period, perhaps greatly aided by his virtuous wife, and was extremely admired and respected by later generations, who specially cast a vessel to worship her. But ultimately, this is unfounded.

This vessel's style is solemn, although it has not lost its heroic and uninhibited spirit. However, the engraving is neat and precise. It must have been made when agricultural settlement had been established for quite some time and the copper smelting industry had a considerable scale of equipment, so it was produced at the earliest after Pan Geng.

The reporter is not an archeology expert, but in today's environment full of war, I feel that the vessel's encounter is also extraordinary. Although bronze vessels are not as interesting as cannons, I am happy to report on them.

The area of He Jia Ling is undoubtedly the location of the Yin temple, especially during the time of King Zhou, when the scale was greatly expanded. However, he did not worship his ancestors (one of the reasons why King Wu attacked King Zhou). Perhaps it had been buried until now in the great fire that destroyed the Shang Dynasty. Didn't the early Zhou dynasty states of Bei, Yong, and Wei already have a sense of desolation?

### Asking "What to Do?"! Sighing "What Can Be Done!"! Guilin's Sad Tale of October

— Special Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong, Guilin Air Dispatch, 16th

Autumn in Guilin is synonymous with dryness. People living there are like ants on a hot pan, with no way out. Occasionally, when an autumn wind rises, yellow sand covers the face. Pedestrians slow their steps, always worrying that the dilapidated buildings beside them will collapse with a "bang." This is what they call the "wind" and "feeling" of late autumn in Guilin.

A few days ago, a chick that had just hatched on Donghua Road in the city flapped its wings and chirped, arousing people's curiosity and becoming a topic of conversation. In a few days, people will look at the grand gathering of the "parent officials" with another mood! At the Provincial Local Administration Conference in the 35th year, they will listen to the endless grievances of ninety-nine county magistrates and one mayor. A small matter, a big matter, these are the most exciting stories in the cold city in late autumn.

In addition to responding to the movement to donate schools to celebrate birthdays, the provincial authorities have also dedicated two roads, renaming Guixi Road and Guidong Road as Zhongzheng Road. For the sake of General Zhongzheng, some people remembered the magnificent Zhongzheng Bridge from two years ago. Now, with only four bridge pillars remaining, they plan to change their minds at the administrative conference.

The Plague Messengers are Reluctant to Leave Guangxi

Diseases have rapidly spread throughout northern Guilin, claiming many lives. The terribleness of the situation cannot be described in words. From Guilin north to Xing'an, no less than 80,000 people are suffering from this disease. From the county magistrate down to the minor staff, the entire Xing'an county government is "shivering," unable to handle official business. The atmosphere inside the yamen is filled with disease. In the villages of Ziyuan, a natural village lost 500 people in less than half a month (how big are the villages in Guangxi?). According to statistics from Rong County, the medicine "Kuining Wan" is sold out in Guilin, and cases of death due to poisoning from "Kuining Wan," turning into blackwater fever, are also common. In the villages, three catties of rice can be exchanged for a single anti-fever pill. Many farmers would rather lie quietly in bed and die than use their sweat and blood to exchange for these "useless things." There is no greater suffering than this. What is strange is that the Plague Messengers are reluctant to leave Guangxi, but why doesn't the Department of Health even glance at it? People are panicking because of the diseases, and the double-cropping rice fields are also being ravaged by insects, resulting in white ears, empty grains, and withered stalks throughout southwestern Guangxi (especially in the Nanning area). The rice is just heading, so they cannot use pruning machines or insect combing tools. They can only watch helplessly as they harvest some straw to burn. The first crop failed, and the second crop yielded nothing. They dare not imagine the spring of next year.

The Egg Changes Hands, Losing an Ounce Each Time

In famine years, with poor harvests and terror creeping in, relief is like a cast-iron anchor for a sailboat in a stormy sea, and there can be no falsehood. A single lie means the death of millions of lives under the sound of "relief, relief." The relief work in Guangxi in recent years has certainly not had any so-called successful results. Perhaps it is a matter of things not going as desired, or perhaps it is human failure. In any case, countless people have died, which is a fact, and not being able to think of a good solution is also a fact. The Director Huang of the Relief Sub-Bureau is enthusiastic, but how many staff members' minds have been twisted by the various kinds of relief supplies! "The egg changes hands, losing an ounce each time." In the end, it is mostly "the west wind rolls up the curtains, and people are fatter than chrysanthemums." Not to mention the disaster victims being reduced to wailing, even the relief clothes that the Sub-Bureau generously distributed to civil servants of various Guilin institutions (such as the city government and newspapers) these days are like the badges worn by officials of the late Qing Dynasty and the fake banners used to summon souls during funerals, torn and tattered, simply treating civil servants like beggars. From this, one can imagine what the refugees will get. Does the United Relief only see the Chinese as beggars? Probably not. Relief supplies are displayed at the beginning of the street in Guilin, and relief supplies are also displayed at the end of the street, and they are all "Chinese attire," exquisite and unparalleled.

New Cars Arrive, Relief Flour Piles Up in Warehouses

Thousands of tons of relief flour are mildewing in the warehouses, and they constantly complain that relief supplies lack transportation. Batches of brand-new "CHT" Dodge vehicles are "loafing" in Guilin Square, rushing around and killing time. If anyone interferes, the driver glares and shouts, "It's the Executive Yuan's business, you're not qualified to interfere!" Oh, Buddha! The relief slogan posted by the Guangxi Sub-Bureau is: "No work, no food." Presumably, these unemployed waiting for orders are eating bread.

Recently, the Executive Relief Administration, concerned about the starving and freezing refugees, is reportedly planning to transport a large quantity of fabric to Guilin for distribution. The quantities are 18 bales of cotton cloth, 460 bales of fabric, 26 bedsheets, 3699 bolts of China Textile fabric, 700 bales of twill fabric, and 250 bales of cotton. Winter is deep, with cold winds and frost. In the past, refugees received ten or eight taels of flour per person. I think, when the fabric is distributed, it won't be as ridiculous as ten or eight inches per person.

Speaking of relief, there is also an interlude. The Guangxi civil servants, who have suffered greatly, asked the Executive Relief Administration to show compassion, and the Executive Relief Administration's reply was: "Civil servants are not the target of relief," so "it is difficult to make an exception to provide relief." In case an exception is made, the civil servants will never finish wearing the relief clothes. The Executive Relief Administration is a bit like the God of Wealth. Poor scholars encountering the God of Wealth often hear things like "difficult," "difficult." Heaven and earth are fair.

No Cars, No Coal, When Will Guiliu Be Connected?

For many days, the news about the Hunan-Guizhou-Guangxi Railway has seemed to be nothing more than filling in a "indefinite repair" formula. The days drag on, the people are distressed, the railway bureau's employees are distressed, and the reporter's pen is also distressed. The opening of just a short section of the road (from Suqiao to Guilin South Station) recently aroused the excitement of countless people. The train, bathed in sunshine, stepped onto the steel rails that had been separated for two years. The locomotive and carriages were like an old ox, and every breath told of countless hardships and difficulties. The carriage and bridge materials were dug out from piles of grass and underwater, repaired and chiseled by hand, and used as best as possible. (The repair work can only be tried on sections that were not heavily damaged. As for the destroyed large bridges, they still collapse and hang in the heart of the river, accompanied by dawn mist and the sadness of treading the moon.) The train entered the South Station with a long whistle, echoing in the hearts of the people in front of the station, both sour and sweet. After two years of silence, it was a reunion. Who can not feel infinite emotion at the sight of the fire dragon running again? However, under the infinite emotion, there is still an infinite emotion. The test run is only a flash in the pan, and the days of operation are still uncertain. At present, with no coal and no cars, the check for the opening of the Guiliu line by the end of November is probably still uncleared, and it needs to be "rediscounted."

Land Transportation Blocked, Seeking Recovery by Air

If land transportation is blocked, air transportation can still be vigorous. Southwest Airlines is planning to resume operations and has received central support, allowing it to allocate aircraft for use and open the Guangdong-Taiwan and Guangdong-Guangxi routes. If it can start flights early, future development can be expected. The current issues to be resolved are the profit and personnel issues of the Guangdong-Guangxi joint venture airline.

In the changing season between late autumn and cold winter, Guilin is always the same quiet. The change of seasons is just an ordinary change in people's eyes. Their hearts are deeper than the Seven Star Cave. Only the noble people are excited and busy building Western-style houses in a large open space in the northwest suburbs in winter, beautifully named "Little Dongshan" (Note: Dongshan is a residential area for high-ranking officials and wealthy people in Guangzhou), showing off their jewels, multi-storied buildings, and overlooking the poor city of Guilin.

Movies and Drama Published Every Sunday

### The Completeness of the Performance: A Review of the Actors in "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace"

— Tao Xiong

A play's performance must be complete! In order to achieve a complete performance, actors must give up individual cheers and applause!

The "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace" performed by the Audience Performance Company is generally welcomed by the public. The Shanghai audience praised the character of Li Lianying in it. The reason for this is not that the actor playing Li Lianying truly typified this character, but because he played it more prominently than others, flaunting his own acting skills and using an unreasonably yin and yang voice. Yang Hua is an actor who understands the audience and knows how to attract them. His makeup as Li Lianying's external appearance gave this role infinite charm. But I dare not consider the blood and flesh he gave this role suitable. Naturally, Li Lianying is a eunuch, a male figure who will never grow a beard. His actions and speech may have some feminine flavor. However, the impression Yang Hua gave me was not this. There wasn't even the slightest feminine feeling. The overall feeling was only insidious and strange speech. Other than that, there was nothing else. I watched "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace" a total of three times, but not once was I able to fully understand Li Lianying's conversations. Sometimes his voice was low and fast, and it was simply impossible to hear what he was saying. This cannot be denied: it is not the failure of this audience member, but the failure of the actor!

Many actors who come from the mainland used to work in war zones and rural areas. When performing, they act with actors who have no stage experience, which makes them develop this habit of "standing out" and "teasing the audience." In that period and region, we could forgive them! But now, it is unforgivable! Because now it is national, representing the highest level of artistic performance in the country! Therefore, what we demand is the completeness of the performance, not the individual applause for the actors. The completeness of "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace" has clearly been destroyed by Yang Hua.

Kou Liancai is a seventeen-year-old young eunuch. When I read the script, I was very fond of him. I found him cute, innocent, and righteous. But in the performance, I felt that the actor's broken voice and his silly tone made him seem like an old man pretending to be innocent.

The actor who plays this role is Shen Yang. His only advantage is being able to drill his own emotions into the character's personality. But consistently having a pretentiously innocent silly tone can also be said to be his only shortcoming. However, in any case, he is much stronger than those actors who have no emotions and only rely on external skills.

Kou Jiabi, who plays Weng Tonghe, replaced Zhang Yan in the middle of the performance, giving us a comparison. Zhang Yan's Weng Tonghe cannot be considered insufficient, but his age for this role was not old enough, so he did not resemble a weak teacher of the king, but rather a veteran general on the battlefield. Kou Jiabi, however, made up for this point. He made his own appearance, his actions, and his voice, and even his personality, all suitable for this weak and stubborn teacher of the king, Tonghe.

### An Epic, Eight Thousand Li of Cloud and Moon

— Zhu Lei

After returning from victory, Lianhua's first film to begin production was "Before and After Victory," written and directed by Shi Dongshan. It has now been renamed "Eight Thousand Li of Cloud and Moon," using a line from Yue Fei's "Manjianghong" as the title. This is more appropriate in terms of content and consciousness. Yesterday, I met Mr. Shi Dongshan and learned the entire story. I must say: this will be a landmark masterpiece among domestic films. Its achievement will be the most brilliant page in this year's domestic films!

The story takes the arduous journey experienced by a pair of exiled actors, Libin (played by Tao Jin) and Lingyu (played by Bai Yang), before and after victory as the warp, and the major national events and social conditions before and after victory as the weft. In terms of time, it spans from the early days of the War of Resistance against Japan, the Battle of Shanghai, the Battle of Xuzhou, the Victory of Northern Hunan, the Battle of Guizhou-Guangxi, to the surrender of the invading bandits, and then the return from Chongqing to Shanghai. In terms of region, it almost traverses most of China's war zones, truly enduring hardship and witnessing eight thousand li of cloud and moon. The most important point is that Mr. Shi uses profound strokes to reflect the strange social phenomena and the miserable lives of the people in various places, such as the difficulties of returning home after peace, the real situation of the disaster areas in Jiangxi provinces, the brutal officials forcibly collecting military rations, the disaster victims selling their children, and the profiteering and corruption of several receiving officials after returning to Shanghai, the extravagant enjoyment of the rich, the influx of American goods into the market, the hospitals extorting patients... A pair of poor artists have experienced the vicissitudes of life and have infinite feelings. The story ends with Bai Yang giving birth to a new life in the hospital, placing infinite hope in the sadness and emotion. The whole film has a sad tone and amazing power, truly writing and painting ten years of historical facts, a thrilling chronicle of a chaotic world!

This play makes me think of Noel Coward's "Cavalcade," which spanned thirty years of national events from the end of the Boer War (1899) through the First World War to 1930. The play also uses a pair of Robert couple as the warp, and the stories that happen around them as the weft. Compared with "Eight Thousand Li of Cloud and Moon," the former tends to write with sentimental and light strokes, while the latter boldly exposes the various aspects of Chinese society with more active and realistic strokes. In terms of atmosphere, the latter may be slightly inferior to the former, but its effectiveness as a realistic needle cannot be underestimated.

The entire film has now completed one-fifth of its filming. According to company officials, it can probably be presented around Christmas this year. The audience can wait patiently for this famous film to arrive!

### The Leads of "Of Mice and Men"

— Yu

Wu Yonggang's "Of Mice and Men" is scheduled to begin filming on the 15th. The main actors are movie queen Hu Die (playing Ji Ruolan), movie emperor Jin Yan, and Liu Qiong. After Jin Yan finishes filming "Of Mice and Men," he will go to the United States to participate in Sun Yu's color film, co-starring with Li Lili.

### Playwrights of China Today

— Naya

In today's low-ebb Chinese drama scene, no powerful new playwrights have emerged; even several of those old, unnoticed ones are good. At the same time, no one has individually introduced them. Now, I will introduce and review several playwrights that everyone is familiar with:

Cao Yu: -- Mentioning this name, everyone will definitely think of his few plays, "Thunderstorm," "Sunrise," "Wilderness," "Beijing Man," these masterpieces! Yes, he is a well-known figure in today's drama scene. Speaking of his plays, they are very well-crafted. Just looking at the fact that he only has these few works after so many years, you can tell that he is a "difficult birth" author.

Although Cao Yu is a well-known author, he has now gone abroad; but judging from his works, his thinking seems to be very backward, a "fatalistic" one, as seen in "Thunderstorm" and "Wilderness." He often arranges a character into "fate," such as in "Thunderstorm," when Sifeng swears to her mother that she will be struck by lightning; as a result, she leaves and is struck by lightning. This kind of line that promotes superstition can be said to be his only mistake.

I hope he can correct this mistake of backward thinking in the future. He has a future in the Chinese drama scene.

Chen Baichen: -- "Officialdom" has been performed to this day, and no one will forget his masterpiece; in modern times, he is also one of the famous writers. Before the war, he had a successful work: the historical drama "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." After the war, "Devil's Cave" ("The New Official Takes Office") is also considered a masterpiece.

In his scripts, the skills in crafting dialogue are excellent; he is only in his thirties this year, so his future works will certainly be many. Currently, there are bound to be erroneous viewpoints in his scripts, such as "Officialdom" and "The New Official Takes Office" that are currently being staged. The official in "Officialdom" seems a bit too excessive. The official says whatever he wants, and he forgets the rights of the people.

Because of his youth, his future is also shining brightly.

Yuan Jun: -- Also known as Zhang Junxiang, his work "Model Teacher for All Ages" was praised by Chairman Chiang. Other works such as "Small Town Story" and "Phoenix City" are also his proud works.

He is a playwright and director. Didn't we see that when "Model Teacher for All Ages" was staged in Shanghai, it was written by Yuan Jun and directed by Zhang Junxiang? From this, we can see his versatility.

Although the performance of "Model Teacher for All Ages" was a deception, his direction was successful. The reason for the failure was the subject matter of the script, which did not seem to be in line with the current era.

His ability to cooperate with his wife, Ms. Bai Yang, will contribute more to the drama scene in the future.

Li Jianwu: -- He is not a successful one among playwrights. This is something that people who engage in drama all know, and it cannot be hidden. He has written many works, mostly scripts, but also novels and essays, but it is impossible to point out which one is particularly outstanding.

He has made great contributions to culture. He is the editor of "Literary Renaissance" and has also worked hard in drama. I hope he can produce several successful works in the future.

### China Electric News

Yesterday, a scene was filmed for "Distant Love," with news reporters taking news photos, requiring the use of a mirror box and magnesium light equipment. "China News Photo Agency" generously agreed to lend it. The agency's photographer, Huang Ningmin, personally brought his "livelihood" to China Electric Second Factory and took many work photos of "Distant Love."

When filming a "wharf" scene for "Distant Love," director Chen Liting specially dispatched stagehand Zhuang Kailu to invite a wonton vendor to the filming location to act as a temporary extra in order to achieve realism. There were more than 300 temporary extras at the factory. They waited a long time to film and had nothing to do, so they frequently ate wontons. Before filming even started, the entire load of 30 catties of noodles and 20 catties of wonton wrappers was consumed. The wonton vendor restocked and still had booming business. Old Guan was always smiling.

### The Sadness of Cyrano

— Guan Yu

Reading "Cyrano"

Rostand's "Cyrano" received honorable recognition when it was first performed by actor Coquelin in 1897. Coquelin was an actor who could fence and recite poetry, but he never had the opportunity to play this type of character, so Rostand wrote this "Cyrano" for him.

Cyrano is a versatile figure who can fence and recite poetry, but he has an extremely ugly big nose, which became an obstacle to his love.

The three main characters in "Cyrano" are Cyrano, Christian, and Roxane. Roxane is Cyrano's cousin, and she is a beautiful girl. Cyrano loves her, but because of his big nose, he dares not tell his cousin the passion in his heart. Christian is a handsome man, but his mind is empty. He is a fool who can neither fence nor write poetry. Because of his handsome appearance, Roxane falls in love with him. At the same time, because of his lack of talent, Roxane may very well not love him. Our hero Cyrano cannot bear for Roxane to suffer, so he uses his own talents to replace Christian in winning this glorious love, promoting the success of the two of them, while he hides to the side and deeply buries the love in his heart.

Christian died in battle. Roxane stayed in a nunnery for fourteen years. Cyrano never left her. When Cyrano was assassinated and about to die, Roxane discovered this secret. She said: I only loved one person and lost him twice!

"Cyrano" is a great work of the late nineteenth century, full of romantic colors. This romantic tragedy has left a deep impression on many people!

Cyrano is a hero in battle! He is a genius among poets! But he lacks a bit of harmony. God did not give him a beautiful face, making him a tragic figure in the arena of love. Although he is a weakling in the arena of love, daring not to boldly tell Roxane his innermost feelings, he is a martyr who understands love. Because he loves the other person too much, he is afraid of being rejected if he speaks his love, so he willingly hides his love in his heart until the last moment of his life.

He is willing to hide in the dark and speak love words to Roxane on the balcony, but let Christian climb up to accept that glorious kiss!

The sadness of Cyrano: It can all be seen in one of his words: "My fate is to be a wire-puller behind people - that is, finally forgotten! (Speaking to Roxane) Do you remember that night when Christian talked to you under the balcony? Well, that's my fate: I hide in the darkness below, and others go up to take that glorious kiss, this is justice. I still praise Moliere for his talent and Christian for his appearance in front of my grave!"

### One Week of Film Reviews

— Zhu Xi

Of all the films this week, "The Life of Emile Zola" is considered the best, but "Tarzan Goes to New York" will likely have the highest box office takings.

The Life of Emile Zola

Small places surpass big places. For example, the scenes from the initial publication of the novel "Nana" to Zola receiving manuscript fees to buy an umbrella are filmed using small snippets, employing a method that deserves close scrutiny. For instance, the long speech delivered by Zola in court relies entirely on the expressions of Paul Muni, which, directorially speaking, cannot be considered a success. Paul Muni excels in small actions. After the film ends, the large advertisements of Paul's full body outside the theater door have a lifelike quality.

Tarzan Goes to New York

In terms of the techniques used in Tarzan films, this is still a top-notch piece. For instance, the elephant herd scenes at the beginning are not the same as before, and the high pole and iron bridge diving scene is excellent.

Adding Mandarin dialogue explanations is not something I can support. At least in Shanghai, which has a long history of Western films, it is unlikely to be welcomed by most people.

Lucky Mr. Prockter

A comedy theme, but handled with a lack of comedic flair. The gunfight scene between Cary Grant and the gangsters is tense, but the ending lacks thoroughness. Only the final scene is handled reasonably well.

Cary Grant is not as satisfactory as one might expect, and Laraine Day is unremarkable.

Freaks' Carnival

There are small gimmicks in the cinematography. Kenny Baker's farcical acting is commendable. However, directorially, there is no great success. The new lead actress, Veenna Marie, is very ordinary.

Desperate Adventure

This is a "Western" that is worth watching. The beginning and end are poor, but the middle part is better. The new actor, Glenn Ford, shows promise, and Evelyn Keyes is also good. The headliner, Randolph Scott, and the second lead, Claire Trevor, are comparatively inferior.

The Desert Song

Dennis Morgan is a failure. The female lead, Irene Manning, is excellent, and her singing voice is also sweet. The director's approach is mediocre, lacking subtlety and heroism. However, the colors are still good, and some effort has been put into the costumes.

New Faces of 1937

The "material women gambling together win" scene is the most successful. The idea of a "Q" is unexpectedly successful and can be called brilliant; the scene of circling in a car is considered one of the best parts in terms of directorial handling. The rest is very ordinary.

However, overall, this film is still a failure. It fails because there is more dialogue than acting, giving it the style of a Chinese "stand-up comedy."

Katharine Hepburn cannot be said to stand out in this film.

Quality Street

The director's handling is too fragmented, and the screenwriter's material is also boring. With such a lineup performing so poorly, it is expected, because Linda Darnell was in decline in Hollywood when she starred in this film. She has no achievements in this film either. Besides being prettier than other actresses, she has no unique characteristics.

Maytime

Jeanette MacDonald has lost her former charm, perhaps because the director did not study her thoroughly. The screenwriter's lines are also very perfunctory and ineffective.

The film is not a top-notch comedy, but it does not create laughable farce either. The stage scenes seem like a small foot trying to fill a large shoe, unable to take big steps. Even the final theme song and dance are not done well.

Actors

The best actors of the week are:

(1) Paul Muni (2) Glenn Ford (3) Kenny Baker (4) Evelyn Keyes (5) Irene Manning.

Spring and Autumn

### Sketches of Society

— Xie Zi

An old Russian woman was walking alone on the road; she was wearing a gold-embroidered silk dress stained with oil, topped with a snuff-colored jacket. Her withered yellow hair was twisted into a bun with a ribbon, tightly held at the back of her head, appearing stiff and inflexible, lacking any lively charm. She carried with her an air of suffocation and heavy snuff odor, and was carrying a net bag filled with odds and ends. Several children were kicking a ball on the road, and the ball hit her net bag. She glared at them fiercely, but quickly returned to her original calm. She was neither thinking nor dreaming; her eyes were dull and lifeless, like a cloud-covered sky, perhaps even darker. She was old, and a long string of years—from bright to gray, from gray to even grayer—was all the same to her. This leisurely and lively evening world was irrelevant to her. She only hoped to go home quickly, throw the net bag down, and sit on the bed to rest her feet.

She staggered away like that. The group of children kicking the ball also chased after their ball, jumping and running into an alley.

This alley was very secluded and deep, with fences on both sides of the alley entrance, covered with messy climbing vines, looking like the quiet residence of a secluded building. A woman in her thirties, with her hands behind her back, was standing there, dressed in a bright green Western suit, not beautiful at all, but with a smug air. She was chatting with a fruit vendor, and several other nannies and old women were also participating in their conversation—a group of women gathered together, chatting aimlessly. The sound of their voices was very lively, with such rising and falling tones, just like the chirping of sparrows in the woods, clear and audible. If a foreigner were here, they should come to appreciate their soft Wu dialect; however, most of the people living here were used to it and did not find it strange. Instead, the crying of a child outside the alley attracted the attention of many people. This child, for some reason, fell to the ground on his back, and his exaggerated crying immediately alarmed his nanny, who ran over and coaxed him, leading him to a stinky tofu vendor and buying him a piece of stinky tofu to eat. The child took the stinky tofu and stopped crying, starting to eat it happily, with bright red chili sauce smeared all over his mouth. The nanny did not pay attention; she seemed to be lost in thought again, her eyes deliberately and unintentionally looking at the pedestrians on the road. She might be thinking about her husband, that useless and unsuccessful husband. She had already married him and had children for him, and she still had to come out and work as a nanny for others. Thinking about it, it was truly unfair.

She leaned against a sycamore tree and sighed softly. Behind the sycamore tree was a Russian deli. The low and dark house was filled with all kinds of pickles. The display window was also particularly small, filled with canned food, chili sauce, ketchup, and other things. Two Russians were sitting in the store, gloomy, damp, and greasy, looking like the pitiful faces of a declining nation. Next to the deli was a hardware store. The display window was larger, of course, with hammers, drills, nails, copper pots, and so on, yellow brass and white iron contrasting each other. A young shop assistant stood at the door reading a newspaper, his face cold and expressionless, just like the hardware items displayed in the window. Past the hardware store was a pale white light, looking gloomy and a bit cold. It turned out to be a fluorescent lamp. The display window of the electrical supply store had its own characteristics, filled with light bulbs, lampshades, light sockets, light fixtures, and even radios. The fat and white light bulbs, the thin and black wires, were all covered in that incurable paleness. There was no one inside the store. An electrician in full work clothes and an apprentice were standing at the store entrance, admiring the display window. It was a photo studio, with various photos displayed in red light; the majesty of generals, the beauty of girls, the kindness of old men, all mixed together. One photo was particularly eye-catching, a picture of a Russian girl's eyes. This photo undoubtedly added much color to this window, this store, and even this street; it was a dazzling and spicy beauty, and it was clear that this was the solid beauty peculiar to Russian girls, not British. The electrician and the apprentice were whispering there, and he was certainly talking about the girl. He himself planned to go to that photo studio to take a picture, taken smartly and upright, and put it together with the Russian girl's beautiful photo. Ah, this is truly a luxurious dream—

Luxurious? He wants to go even further! He thinks that the Russian girl will be greatly moved when she sees his photo. One day she will walk into the photo studio and ask the shop owner, "Who is this handsome young man?" Then he, the electrician, will walk gracefully to her, bow deeply, and in each other's gaze, they will recognize that the other is the hero and beauty in the photo. Then they will fall in love with each other, and maybe they will get married... Ah, this is an even more absurd dream—

Absurd? In Shanghai, people of any status are qualified to have this kind of absurd dream. Who can predict? Maybe one day he will get an unexpected fortune, or he will get rich by doing electrical supply business; or else, he will get her fortune because he married that girl. At that time, who would not envy him? He will sit in a car, take his lovely wife, and drive here to take a spin, reminiscing about his hard beginnings, with a proud smile on his face, nodding to his old acquaintances. But he decided not to make further expressions to them, so as not to lose his status; he also did not intend to stay here for a long time. He will drive the car, pass through Avenue Joffre, pass through Avenue Foch, and drive to the bustling racecourse, then park the car at the door of the International Hotel. He will take his beloved wife's arm and walk in with high head and broad steps, ignoring everyone else. In this way, the whole of Shanghai will be under his feet.

The whole of Shanghai under his feet is not surprising; he had climbed up the utility poles to repair electric wires. The poles were forty or fifty feet high. At that time, if not the whole of Shanghai, at least half of Shanghai was under his feet.

Thinking like this, he couldn't help but feel proud. Coincidentally, there was a sugar-roasted chestnut stall not far from him, so he walked over and bought a thousand copper coins worth of finely roasted chestnuts to treat his apprentice little brother.

As soon as he bought them, other people also went to buy them, and so, in a flash, this chestnut stall made five thousand copper coins worth of business.

But the chestnut king standing behind the roasting pot was not grateful to him. He still held an iron shovel, stirring and stirring. The dark red fire shone on his face. He had no smile on his face, nor the absurd dreams of young people. He was old.

A burst of "crackling" chestnut shells fell on the ground. The autumn wind treated them like fallen leaves, blowing them forward. Some fell into the gutter, some fell under the rubber tires of the rickshaw, with a "smack" sound. The life of the chestnut, from flowering to bearing fruit, and the life of the sycamore leaves, from sprouting to new green to yellowish green, ended like this.

Although some leaves had already fallen on the ground, there were still more leaves remaining on the branches. The trees here were originally very lush, and now they had almost become intertwined with branches and leaves. A person standing here could imagine that they were standing in a quiet cave. At the exit of the cave, you could see the vast sky and a faded city street. Faded but still restless, trams and cars came and went, and small motorcycles were "puffing and puffing" out black air, with bustle but no prosperity, with shouting but no joy. Looking at this street, it would remind one of the green-clad woman just seen. It and she both want to use a kind of artificial effort to make up for their ordinariness. But the impression they give is a vulgar flaunting.

Suddenly, a rickshaw came out of this green cave. A person was sitting in the rickshaw, holding two steam oil lamps in his hand—two strange lemon yellows. Everyone felt strange; it was not dark yet, why light the lamps? The person sitting in the car, however, had a nonchalant look on his face. This rickshaw had to continue to pass through many roads—the shouting and lively roads, the poetic roads, the very urban roads, and even the rugged and uneven cobblestone roads, and finally maybe stop in a small alley. Then, these two lemon yellows that had once made passers-by turn their heads would be considered to have arrived home and began to hide their brilliance, to live their small and even smaller lives.

In fact, all the pedestrians on the road will have to return home to live their small and even smaller lives, but, pitifully, they don't even have these two lemon yellows that make people turn their heads!

### Jialing River (Woodcut)

— Liu Xian

### Silence

— Yang Mou

I understand how to think, but I don't understand how to live.

Ideals are so high that they hang in the clouds, while reality is trampled in darkness and disorder. When a torch falls into a pool of water, with a splash, everything is over. When ideals are crushed into the abyss of despair, what more can there be?

Who wants to approach a filthy demon? But when it forces itself on you, what do you have in your life to resist it? Everyone wants to enshrine their soul as sacred, rejecting the temptation of evil, but when they think of these, they can't help but tremble.

Like a weak cry in the wilderness, my protest is only silent. The anger in my heart has already become numb. Raise my head, straighten my chest, I know, but in a low-pressure environment, perhaps yielding is more appropriate.

Standing before my own judgment, I am honest; the surging tide cannot devour my tenacious soul; but in these piles of sins, what can be used to wash them away? I often have to dress myself as experienced and brave, but what is hidden is only naivety and fragility.

I want to shout, and I don't want to shout. Understanding how to think, thinking makes me suffer. Not understanding how to live, life brings me setbacks everywhere. —— I quietly sealed my mouth shut.

### Window

— Yi Tao

I still live in that tent that was once built in a cold mountain city, and the tent is still built on a square in the suburbs. So I still face a self-made screen window, and the screen window still faces the far end of the open space.

Although my journey is so complex and varied, when I stop my steps and rest in a place where I can rest, my heart is as quiet as a pond of spring water. So I repeatedly build my little cloth house and spend a long day in the small room. In these days, I live helplessly, like a prisoner who cannot get freedom. My heart leads my wings to be bound by a kind of drowsiness, and I cannot get rid of the torture of shackles for a long time. So I can only face the window, depicting many past events or future prospects, and the past is a group of gray and white dew, and the future is like colorful morning glow, which is so insignificant and irrelevant to my own life.

I have repeatedly waited at the window, perhaps in the golden morning or in the gloomy dusk, like those days of flying rain and snow. I wait for a child's shadow, as if her shadow is frozen, like a traveler despairing on the riverbank of a broken bridge. My strings are broken, and I never hear their faint sound. If the sun never wants to set out to shine on our earth, her shadow will never thaw, never flow to my window. So I angrily jump out of the window, letting the rain ravage my limbs. I walked to the shadow, and she was by the warm stove, giving me a contemptuous shallow smile. …

My determination no longer allows me to remember these things. Moreover, I am far away from that shadow in the north and south of the sky. But precisely because today I am facing the window, the revelation of the window asks me to go back and visit that rugged mountain journey.

Fortunately, it is no longer the season of flying snowflakes, and the people I looked forward to in the past have also lost their news. What appears outside the window at this moment is the earth burned by the sun's fire, and the season when pomegranate flowers are red and green grass is growing strongly. Therefore, I will never close the curtains, close my eyes, and meditate on a past event. Instead, I let the sun come in, let the wind come in, if my window has shadows, I will run out and run to the distance in the sunny ground. …

Leaving Lanzhou on Double Ninth Festival in the Bingxu year

### The Old Capital

— Sheng Cheng

Meeting and parting in Youzhou,
The great rivers and mountains are vying for leadership,
The dust of ages is sudden and vague,
The wind and colors of the city are leisurely;
Young, I did not know the joy of spring,
In times of trouble, I cherish the worries of the Double Ninth;
The flames of China are high in the houses,
From Kunlun, I will travel to build a pouring torrent.

### Farewell to Old Man Baishi

— Former person

An old man in the lake and mountains is most legendary,
The Heavenly Pillar is towering and winding;
The brush contains subtle beauty,
The blade has no flaws but hides the truth,
In old age, he is uniquely awake, a declining scholar,
In troubled times, he seeks perfection as an old citizen;
People do not blame him for cultivating literature on paper,
The autumn wind sends guests away, freedom is spring.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 74

— Ye Jingfeng

Hu Di knew that some of the people traveling with him looked down on him, perhaps jealous of his small achievements, so he had to proceed alone, capturing several rebellious men and women, interrogating them, taking some licenses and scattered documents, and writing this note for me behind people's backs. Hu Di did not read much. Usually, writing a family letter, he inevitably makes some spelling mistakes, but it would never be as bad as this note, written so poorly. Presumably, he was a little angry at the time, and panicked, so he made many spelling mistakes, and the sentences were incoherent. However, I felt that from now on, his literary education should be given special attention. This is an important task that I consciously "cannot shirk."

After reading the note and finding out the causes and consequences, I was pondering when another messenger from Hu Di rushed here, saying that he had inquired in several places before finding this place. "Xiao Hucheng, the deputy team leader, is missing!" He also said that the action team leader already knew and was waiting for me to return to headquarters to talk.

Logically, I should immediately return to the headquarters, report everything, and discuss a solution, either I would be responsible for forcing Hu Di to return, or the team leader would propose a method to search and suppress Shuanglongjian. But these first and second points are difficult to do. Even if they are done, Hu Di will no longer trust me; and even worse, he will lose his temper and run away. Publicly and privately, I will have some difficulty explaining.

To be honest, I also intend to venture into Shuanglongjian. Now that Yin Ni is hiding there, he is the source of the trouble. If there is an opportunity, a bullet can send him to hell. If I report it, with Shuanglongjian's kind of equipment, I am afraid that all our strength, including the reorganized security team and the 12th Regiment, will be sent to encircle and suppress it, but it may not be successful. If it is not done well, we will suffer sacrifices in vain. Moreover, can we mobilize all our strength at this time to do this relatively less urgent work?

After I made up my mind, I ordered the two messengers to wait here for a while, and when my messengers arrived, they would return to the headquarters together. I would take a step first. After saying these words, I also notified the commissioner in charge of arresting rebels, and rushed to the original parking place. The two cars were still parked there well. After asking the driver's service, I knew that Hu Di had not come to ask for the car. I knew that Hu Di could not drive and did not want the service to know his whereabouts, so he probably hired a car or thought of another way to leave. Anyway, it was only about ten miles to Sister Cui's place.

Immediately, I ordered the service to leave a car and asked two people to drive one back, saying that I had a small matter to deal with and could return to the headquarters in ten minutes, asking them to report it first. I used this method to transfer the two of them away so that I could act freely.

After the two left, I checked the fuel gauge and saw that it was still full. Fearing that the team leader would send someone to find me, I got in the car and circled around a few streets in the city, and then drove towards Shuangqiao. After leaving the city, passing our own outermost sentry post, I slightly changed my dress, added some makeup to my face, removed the temporary armband, and checked the pistol's magazine; it was a new German-style twenty-round pistol. To be careful, when the car entered the truly unmanned and unguarded area, I got out of the car and re-examined it, eliminating all traces of official business in the car. However, I was very strange, why on this highway, for a long section, there was not only no trace of people, but also no sentry patrols on either side.

After walking another section, I came to a fork in the road, still not seeing anyone. I suddenly noticed that on that fork road, the soil was loose and there were many messy ruts, so I stopped the car by the side of the road, got out of the car, and carefully examined these tracks. After examining twenty or thirty yards to the north and south, I found traces of light and heavy tanks, armored vehicles, and various sizes of wheels. These tracks were all a little to the left, knowing that it was a march going south. "Which mechanized unit is this from?" I repeatedly asked myself. Because at that time, I did not know that this was a branch road that went north directly to Shuanglongjian and south directly to the Pingjin Highway.

Free Talk

### Fragmented Words Under a Dim Lamp

— Shao Fu

The Chengdu City Council nearly came to blows over the issue of lifting the ban on dancing. Among the most brilliant remarks was a few angry words from those who supported lifting the ban:

"Good! In the future, if any sister or girl has problems because of secretly dancing, don't cry for leniency!"

Those who have been to Sichuan can appreciate the intonation when these words are spoken.

In fact, it is better to be open and aboveboard than to be secretive. Openness is better than secrecy, and besides, dancing is not a crime.

Yesterday, a postman who often delivers letters came to my house to sell matches. Before I could ask, he said:

"Sir! I'm really ashamed, my family of several people is difficult to support. I have no choice but to sell some small items to supplement my household."

The matches were not more expensive than those on the market, so I was happy to accept them. At the same time, I also respect such people, at least they are seeking profit from capital and supporting themselves.

### The Pujiang Bridge: Expanding Urban Construction

The area of Shanghai is not limited to the former two concessions. It possesses an area ten times larger. However, the bustling areas are confined to the smaller circle. This has led to a housing shortage, with a house costing a hundred taels of gold, and renting an office space costing several gold bars. As for the roads, there are more people than ants, and the traffic is constant. Despite implementing one-way traffic, the congestion remains unchanged.

"Expanding the urban area" should be the call for the future! Previously, the Yangjingbang Creek hindered the north-south market, but it was filled. The Suzhou Creek also has various bridges connecting the north and south banks. Human effort can overcome everything. Within the country, haven't there already been three bridges spanning the Yellow River? Abroad, the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco was built ten years ago and is still considered a famous engineering marvel in the world.

So, why is the Huangpu River still a separate world? Everyone is thinking that if there were a bridge across the Huangpu River, wouldn't the prosperity of Puxi (Shanghai west of the Huangpu River) immediately reach Pudong (Shanghai east of the Huangpu River)? The lack of municipal funding is one reason. In addition, although the river is small, the ships that travel on it are quite large, which is also a very important factor.

A flat bridge like the Sichuan Road Bridge or the Waibaidu Bridge is indeed impossible to build over the Huangpu River, except at the southern end of the Pujiang River. The only solution is to build a tunnel or use an active bridge. According to the design of the China Bridge Company, assuming a double-opening active bridge, the clearance under the bridge is ten meters above the highest water level, the bridge width is twelve meters, plus sidewalks, three meters on each side, for a total width of eighteen meters, a slope of four percent, and a clear height of six meters inside the bridge. If this bridge is built according to the above figures, it would be an ordinary bridge, but even medium-sized ships would have difficulty passing through, especially those with flagpoles, chimneys, and observation platforms. Therefore, using a double-opening active design can avoid this.

However, after the bridge is opened, the presence of cars and trams on the bridge will have an impact. Therefore, in theory, the bridge can be raised, while the slope will still be around four percent. If designed this way, the slope will extend to the vicinity of Xizang Road, making the project even more immense.

If a tunnel is used, the slope would be four or five percent, the clear height four and a quarter meters, and the width, according to regulations, only six meters. This is only equivalent to the two sidewalks of an active bridge, and it is also too narrow and not very practical.

Although the above is all speculation and casual talk, if it is to be put into practice, I really don't know how much money it will cost, how much manpower it will take, and how much time it will require; but, can you say that this is impossible?

### Nothing More Than That

— W·W

Having paid the fees, what are you afraid of, teacher? At worst, don't come next semester. If I'm not welcome here, there are other places that will welcome me. "Warning," "Major Demerit," etc., nothing more than that.

Suppress him. Eliminate the black market? The black market turns into a white market, and the white market turns back into a black market! Simply abolish price controls. Black and white are indistinguishable, in fact, it's hard to separate them. Severe punishment, etc., just a scare, nothing more than that.

Intensify the capture of pickpockets, and pickpocketing work intensifies. "Matching wits with a worthy opponent!" At worst, a few slaps, a few days of free meals, a round of reprimands, three flavors, nothing more than that.

"By order, smoking is prohibited within the premises," the thunder belongs to enforcement, but the smoke dissipates. Before long, they are again swallowing clouds and spitting mist. "By order, eliminate street vendors," the wind howls and the cranes cry. Perhaps it concerns taxes. In a few days, they are again everywhere. By order, eliminate, etc., nothing more than that.

From reporting corruption to strict investigation, from executing the investigation to stopping at the right time, it's as if it happened just yesterday and the day before, and now it's completed. Such a broad matter, to get to the bottom of it, is as easy as turning your hand, nothing more than that.

Suddenly being hungry for a meal is really unbearable; being used to being hungry is nothing more than that. Living with a lot of money and dying with empty hands, so what? Nothing more than that?

### History and Geography

— Jianhua

According to reports, the Shanghai World Geography Society published "Map of the New World Situation," in which the content is full of errors, such as still considering Taiwan and Korea as Japanese territory. Isn't this extremely absurd!

Recently, the failure of history and geography education in our country has gradually been recognized by the academic community. There have been many instances of humorous stories about history and geography examinations published in newspapers and magazines: such as Qin Shi Huang being born after Emperor Wu of Han, Yuan Shikai being the emperor of the Qing Dynasty, Huizhou being the capital of Anhui Province, Chifeng being a small island in Japan, and even more than half of the four thousand exam papers from the first year of high school not knowing in which year of the Republic the "September 18th Incident" occurred. These strange stories are truly amazing, making people laugh and cry. Not to mention the books from the past eight or nine years, most of the newly published middle school history and geography textbooks are still copied from old ones, pieced together. Some have books but no maps, some have books and maps that don't match, and some are even as absurd as the "Map of the New World Situation," which not only misleads young people but also concerns the national system.

However, schools at all levels now not valuing history and geography teaching also bear a great responsibility. When students are in class, the room is bare except for the blackboard, desks, and chairs. Teachers lecture and gesture, going through the motions. Students read novels, write love letters, and chat casually. How can they get good grades this way!

Finally, I hope that public and private primary and secondary schools, having collected many tuition fees this semester, should prepare more charts related to history and geography (the Education Bureau stipulates that office expenses account for 20% to 30% of tuition fees). Don't let students sit empty in the classroom, clueless. Teachers should also not spend time on salary increase petitions, but should pay attention to preparing teaching materials, and stop misleading students.

### The Question of Attitude

— Shengjie

There are two kinds of people in society.

When taking the tram, if you take a bad ticket or buy a ticket with a corner missing, the ticket seller is likely to say, "Do you have eyes?" Then your response is even more fierce, leading to unpleasantness. If the ticket seller changes his approach and says, "Sir! Please change your ticket, okay!" Your feeling is completely different from the former.

Walking on the street or taking the train, car, or tram, when you are smoking a cigarette, a friend next to you borrows fire without your permission and immediately takes your cigarette to light his, or he says "Light one" to you, and before you have a chance to answer, he takes your cigarette while saying it. This is one type of person. There is another type of person who never borrows fire from others if he doesn't have fire, or politely asks you to borrow fire, saying, "Please lend me a light." After speaking, he remains silent and waits for you to agree to hand him the cigarette before taking the fire. These two types of people need the same thing, but their attitudes are very different.

Of course, a person who is outwardly humble may not be honest, but this is not a reason for you to be arrogant to others! The same sentence, due to the difference in tone and attitude, often has a difference of thousands of miles. Kindness and courtesy are always essential elements in group living!

### Anecdotes from the Military

— Translated by Huaiyuan

Private Johnson, after marrying his childhood sweetheart, was granted two weeks of leave for his honeymoon. His leave of absence was soon to expire and he wired his commanding officer to ask for an extension, saying, "This place is too wonderful, requesting your permission for another week of leave."

The commanding officer's reply was also humorous: "This place is also very wonderful, return to camp immediately."

During the war, American newspapers often reported on the romances between American pilots and charming Australian girls. Later, an American girl wrote to her lover in Australia and asked, "Australian girls are so attractive to you, what do they have that we don't have?"

"They have everything you have," her lover replied, "but theirs is all right here."

Officer: "Idiot, you gave me the wrong pair of boots. Can't you see one is black and the other is yellow?"

Orderly: "Yes, but I have to report to the officer that your other pair of boots is also like that (one black and one yellow)."

A recruit is being examined by a doctor. The doctor asked him, "Can you see anything without your glasses?"

"Without my glasses," the recruit replied, "I can't even hear."

Another set of quadruplets born. Is it because too many people died in the war?

(Note: The illustration shows a woman in Paris, with four daughters born in one birth, all alive. —Sent by the New York Times)

### Acting Smart

— Yinyuan, translated from the October issue of "Crown" magazine

The child came home from school with a lot of knowledge. His father was reading the newspaper, but the child was determined to show off his knowledge. "Hey, Dad," he began, "did you know that in some parts of India, a man never sees his wife until he gets married?"

His father replied without surprise, "That's how it was with me and your mother, my good boy."

"I absolutely don't want this room," an old woman declared to the clerk. "I won't pay a high rent to live in a back room with a folded bed. If you think I just came from the country, then you..."

"Go in, Madam, just go in," the clerk impatiently reminded her. "This is not a room, it's an elevator."

### Sunday Miscellany: Regarding a Year of Thirteen Months

(Editor's Note: This issue was originally scheduled to be discussed in the next "Sunday Miscellany." Due to the large number of submissions received, we will begin this week. The next miscellany will still be on this issue. Readers are welcome to contribute their opinions!)

### Worth a Try

— Xu Ying

If it weren't for the frequent wars in recent years, calendar reform would have had a decent achievement long ago.

In 1933, the League of Nations General Assembly discussed the calendar, and there were many discussions. Representatives from various countries raised as many as 185 points of dissatisfaction with the current calendar - the Gregorian calendar (i.e., the solar calendar).

At the same time, the inability to unify the calendars of various countries also caused a lot of unnecessary trouble. Someone once joked, saying: "If someone likes to join in the fun, they can celebrate the New Year three times in one year. The first New Year (solar calendar) can be spent safely in London or New York, then rush to the Balkan Peninsula to spend another one (Julian calendar - followed by the Slavic people), and finally take a plane back to China to spend another one (lunar calendar)."

Mr. Duzui re-raised the reformed calendar of thirteen months a year in "Freedom Talk". This calendar was proposed by a man named Posltivist, so it is called the Posltivist calendar. There are thirteen months a year, twenty-eight days a month. The newly added month is added in the middle of June and July, named "Sol." An extra day is added at the end of the year, and one day is added at the end of June every four years, which is considered a leap year. This calendar is good, but it commits a great taboo. Look! Thirteen months a year, the number thirteen is very ominous, not to mention that the thirteenth of every month is Friday.

In addition, there is a new calendar called the "World Calendar," which divides the year into four "quarters," each quarter three months, one large month of thirty-one days, and two small months of thirty days, for a total of thirteen weeks in each quarter. Each quarter begins on Sunday and ends on Saturday. A Saturday is added at the end of the year, called the "Year End Day." One day is added every four years between June and July, called the "Leap Day."

Before World War II, the "World Calendar" aroused everyone's interest. Fourteen countries decided to try it at the end of 1939 or 1944, but 1939 to 1944 were spent in the midst of war, and people's minds were filled with airplanes, cannons, submarines, and tanks. Where was there time to reform the calendar?

Now, let's try it!

### Doesn't Make Sense

— Jin Xieshan

The usefulness of a calendar is to help people's memory. Anyone who forgets what day it is today can look at the calendar and recall the memory. It really has nothing to do with fixing thirteen months a year and twenty-eight days a month. Otherwise, February in the solar calendar is twenty-eight days, and July and August have thirty-one days, which are all fixed every year. If it is because of the fixed nature that we don't need to use a calendar, then can't we not use a calendar now?

There is really no need to change the new calendar to a "scientific calendar." Of course, I wouldn't oppose a reasonable reform. However, I feel that we need to live more lively lives. Anything that becomes rigid and fixed will become boring. We certainly need neatness and order, but we sometimes also need to cater to nature and liveliness. Our ten fingers are not neatly arranged, and although they don't make us feel ugly, if someone thinks they are tired of looking at them and must change them to be all the same length, even if it is possible, I don't think it will necessarily make our work more convenient!

### New Suggestions

— Yang Lansheng

I vaguely remember that before the War of Resistance Against Japan, world calendar experts published the so-called scientific calendar, stipulating that the year should be divided into thirteen months, each month four weeks, a total of twenty-eight days, and one day at the end of the year on New Year's Eve was named "a happy day," and two days in leap years.

"Freedom Talk" today is especially asking everyone to consider and contribute opinions on the thirteen months a year. This matter seems unimportant, but in fact, the world's calendar, weeks, and seasons cannot cooperate closely, and the months, days, and weeks are out of sync. Especially in our country, the yin and yang calendars are both disobeying and weird. It is indeed a great regret! If it is changed to a scientific calendar in the future, the weeks, months, and days will have fixed rules to follow, which will be of great convenience to social life!

I admit that the scientific calendar is successful in two points: First, the first day of each month is Monday or Tuesday, and the extra day outside of the fifty-two weeks of the year is listed as a "happy day." But there are also shortcomings. The biggest shortcoming is that thirteen months a year destroys the order of the four seasons of the year and loses the original meaning of science, so we don't need to strictly maintain the scientific calendar. The original year (four seasons and twelve months) should not be changed arbitrarily!

My opinion: A year can be divided into four seasons and twelve months, each three months being thirteen weeks, of which two months are four weeks and one month is five weeks. What needs to be studied now is whether the extra week should be placed in the first month? Or in the second or third month? In fact, any month will do.

### Official Hospital

— Doctor

Words from a doctor: This New Year, we are thinking. The × Hospital was established, and I joined this well-equipped × Hospital (formerly a famous Japanese × Hospital). The medicines, equipment, food, and all necessary items inside were all available (there were as many as five ×-ray machines), enough for ten years of use; from this, we can see the general ambition of the Japanese.

Now, the remaining medicines are used as they are, and the equipment is damaged piece by piece, with no way to replenish them. No one cares. Even gauze bandages, which can be washed, disinfected, and reused after use, are thrown away after being used once. Why is this done? The reason is that the treatment is too poor, the management is lacking, and people don't work with enthusiasm. Everyone has the attitude of just getting through the day.

Speaking of treatment, it is even more pitiful. When this hospital first opened its doors in February this year, everyone thought that after years of resistance, the whole of China had received a lot of lessons and should be properly reformed to reach a truly bright path. Therefore, at that time, the doctors, nurses, and tea servants in all departments were very neat and energetic. Until four or five months later, the treatment was so little that the average doctor's monthly salary was 70,000 yuan, the nurse's was 40,000, and the tea servant's was 5,000, while the prices outside were changing drastically every day. The director always said that he would increase it several times next month to retain people, but the result was still a pie in the sky, unable to satisfy hunger. Until now, the average doctor's monthly salary is 100,000 yuan, the nurse's is 70,000 yuan, and the tea servant's is 20,000 yuan. The director still says he will increase it, but even doubling it will not work. What use are these few dollars?

As for the food, not to mention, there are only canned fish and beef left by the Japanese, which are really worthless in nutrition, simply like eating old dry grass, but they are available every day, every meal. We have been eating it for nine months, and we are still eating it now. I think we will have to eat it in the future. The rest is smelly fish, old clover, and half-cooked onions; the soup is just boiled water with some salt, and oil has never been seen at all. The rice is either brown or yellow and smelly. If you want to eat it, it's like this, if you don't want to eat it, it's like this. Now everyone is pale and thin. If this continues, I guarantee that everyone will get tuberculosis.

Because the treatment is driving people to their deaths and there is no way to survive, many doctors and nurses have left. Such a large hospital, with almost a hundred beds, is full every day, but there are only five doctors and nine nurses, so the work is quite busy. Sometimes, there is also a physical examination for soldiers going abroad, thirty to fifty every day, and they have to be examined within a limited number of days. It is really as Mr. Lu Xun said: "We are cows, eating grass, and squeezing out milk."

I just don't understand, do the officials have parents, wives, and children? How do you support them? Is your monthly salary also 100,000 yuan? Why should you live in foreign houses, drive cars, and eat fish and meat?

When we doctors really have no way to survive, the most we can do is quit, but I hope you officials will use your brains and think of ways to reform! I believe that this situation is not only in our hospital, but every state agency is the same, and everyone who receives military treatment has the same feeling. But they are smiling wryly while crying!
