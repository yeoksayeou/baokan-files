He took off at 10:44 am. Those who came to see him off included Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi, Commander-in-Chief of Logistics Huang Zhenqiu, Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force Zhou Zhirou, and others. Before taking off, the Chairman spoke with Minister Bai in front of the plane for about three minutes before boarding. He initially sat in the co-pilot's seat. Twenty minutes after takeoff, he went to the small bedroom inside the plane to change into casual clothes, then returned to the co-pilot's seat, carefully observing the terrain along the way. As he approached his destination, the Chairman changed back into a long gown. He arrived at Xun'er Taokou Airport at 12:32 pm. Those accompanying him included Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Yu Jishi, Secretary of the National Government Cao Shengfen, Shen Changhuan, and Chiang Ching-kuo. Those welcoming him at the airport included Governor of Jiangxi Province Wang Lingji. A special naval No. 12 boat stationed in Xun came to the airport to welcome him. When the Chairman entered Jiujiang City, cheers resounded everywhere. The people considered it an honor to see the Chairman's dignified bearing, and many elementary school students shouted "Long live Chairman Chiang!" The Chairman smiled and nodded frequently.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] After the Meiling-brand airplane delivered Chairman Chiang to Xun, it took off at 12:55 pm and returned to Beijing at 2:21 pm. The pilots from the Air Transport Brigade, Yuan Fu'en as captain, Zhang Zu'an as co-pilot, and Chen Renqiu as communications officer, were at the helm of the Meiling aircraft all day, shouldering the heaviest responsibility of transporting important personnel to Lushan. A reporter boarded the Meiling aircraft for a tour. The aircraft is a C47 model. Behind the cockpit, there is a specially prepared sofa bed, entirely milky white, covered with a blanket, with deep sky-blue velvet curtains on both sides. Behind it, there are eight sofa seats, followed by a luggage storage area, and at the very end, there is a galley with electrical equipment and sanitary facilities. This special plane is only used by the Chairman and Madam (Cardinal Tien had also boarded this special plane) and is never used by others.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] Madam Chiang took off from Beijing at 3:50 pm on the Meiling aircraft to Xun. Those accompanying her included Huang Renlin, Director-General of the Lishi Society, Cheng Sheng, a military officer from the Chairman's official residence, her maid, and five other attendants. Five minutes before takeoff, Madam arrived at the airport and toured the entire site by car. She then drove directly to the aircraft and asked Director-General Huang, "Is everything ready?" She then shook hands with Director Zhou Zhirou, who was seeing her off at the airport, and said, "Goodbye," before climbing the stairs and boarding the plane. Madam was wearing a dark blue silk cheongsam with small white flowers and high heels today, boarding the plane with an extremely calm demeanor. Soon after, the aircraft started and took off. As the reporter drove out of the airport, the Meiling aircraft was already soaring into the sky.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force Zhou Zhirou flew to Xun this morning on a 'B25' aircraft and returned to Beijing at around 3 pm this afternoon. According to Zhou, the Jiujiang Airport has now been completely repaired, and airplanes can take off and land freely. However, large aircraft cannot currently land, so during the period of transporting personnel, the 'C47' aircraft will make the greatest effort to accomplish its due task.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] The date for Ambassador Stuart's arrival in Beijing has been confirmed as around 12 noon on the 15th.

### Lin Biao Temporarily Breaks His Appointment Again; Du-Lin Meeting Also Fails; Communist Army's Sincerity Is Doubtful

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 14th Dispatch] Upon the request of the US group, Chief Executive Du was originally scheduled to fly to Changchun on the 14th to meet with Lin Biao. However, Chief Executive Du suddenly received a telegram from Cai Zonglian, the government representative of the Changchun Military Mediation Branch, stating that Lin Biao's Chief of Staff, Wu Xiuquan, informed him that Lin Biao could not come due to some matter and asked him to pay his respects to Chief Executive Du and express his apologies. This afternoon, the reporter visited Chief Executive Du to inquire about the trip. Du stated that he sincerely wished to meet with Lin Biao, but Lin's sudden notification that he could not come was quite unexpected. According to the reporter, the Du-Lin meeting was carefully planned by the US group and was originally scheduled to take place in Changchun on the 11th. Chief Executive Du had agreed to fly to Changchun on that day, but he was later notified that it would be held on the 14th instead. Unexpectedly, the Communist army broke its appointment again. The Communist army's sincerity is quite doubtful.

[Agence France-Presse, Beiping, 13th Dispatch] According to a spokesman for the Communist Party, General Lin Biao, commander-in-chief of the Northeast Communist Army, is unwilling to go to Changchun to meet with General Du Yuming, commander-in-chief of the Northeast National Army. Regarding the Harbin issue, it can only be resolved in Nanjing and is not subject to interference by others.

### Liu Zhi's Speech

Communist Army Attempts to Seize Western Henan

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 13th Dispatch] Regarding the Communist army's attempt to encroach on western Henan in the Central Plains Military Region, Director Liu Zhi of the Pacification Headquarters recently told reporters that the Communist army's deliberate intention in this disturbance is to form a vast new occupied area in the area of northern Hubei and southern Henan. Recently, the Communist Party announced that Li Xiannian would be the commander-in-chief of the Henan-Hubei guerrilla forces, making their intention to expand their occupied area even more obvious. After Li Xiannian led his main force westward, more than 5,000 soldiers were left in the Dabie Mountains and Xiaojigong Mountains east of the Pinghan Railway, using them as their base camp. Recently, the Communist army's Liu Bocheng unit in the Wenxian Jiyuan area on the north bank of the Yellow River has been actively increasing its forces, waiting for an opportunity to cross south and attempt to join forces with Li Xiannian's unit in the Funiu Mountains, occupying the entire western Henan. In early June, the Communist Party falsely accused the National Army of launching an attack on Li Xiannian's unit, and at the same time falsely claimed that there was a food shortage in the area, requesting that it be transferred to northern Anhui. In fact, this was an excuse for today's disturbance.

### Suspects in the Li Gongpu Assassination Case Being Pursued by Yunnan Garrison Command; Li's Remains to be Cremated Tomorrow

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 13th Dispatch] A spokesman for the Yunnan Garrison Command announced today that after the news of Mr. Li Gongpu's death from a violent assassin was reported to the command, in addition to strictly ordering all units, military police, and agencies to arrest the perpetrators within a time limit and bring them to justice, the suspect Li Chengye, who was handed over to the command by the police bureau, was immediately interrogated. Li firmly denied the charges and no weapons were found. The investigation is still ongoing. The command is responsible for maintaining security and should do its best to arrest the perpetrators and bring them to justice in order to comfort the deceased. In recent days, a few people have wantonly slandered the command in an attempt to shift the blame, fearing that the world will not be in chaos, which is regrettable. The command is responsible for security and does not interfere in any issues outside of security. Therefore, in this case, in addition to intensifying orders to subordinates to arrest the perpetrators and ensure that the case is solved, it is hoped that the people of society will provide more assistance.

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 13th Dispatch] After interrogation by the Third Police Sub-Bureau, the suspect arrested in the Li Gongpu case claimed to be named Li Chengye, 22 years old, from Sichuan, living at 58 Tuodong Road, a mechanic at the Aviation Committee's Tenth Aircraft Repair Shop. He claimed that he was going to Dameiyuan Lane (near Xueyuanpo) to find someone, and had no weapons. The sub-bureau has handed Li over to the garrison command for interrogation.

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 14th Dispatch] Li Gongpu's remains were placed in a coffin on the 14th and will be cremated at Yunda Hospital on the 16th.

### Talking About the Extraordinary Beauty of Lushan

— By Our Reporter, Maitian

"The extraordinary beauty of Kuanglu [Lushan], surpasses all the mountains in the world." This is a famous line from Bai Juyi's writing. Furthermore, there are countless poems and prose from past poets and scholars praising the scenic beauty of the mountain. The Guling area on the southern side of Lushan is surrounded by secluded valleys, mountain peaks, waterfalls, forests, and flourishing bamboo, and combined with modern facilities, it is no wonder it has become a famous summer resort both in China and abroad. However, the greatness and majesty of Lushan, its value and importance, in modern history, are no longer just expressed by its appearance. Everyone remembers that in the early stages of launching the War of Resistance, Chairman [Chiang Kai-shek] convened dignitaries from both the government and opposition parties, as well as senior military and political leaders, to hold an emergency meeting in Lushan, and at the crucial moment, they decided to raise the sacred banner of the War of Resistance. After eight years of arduous struggle, final victory was finally achieved.

However, after nine years, this historical paradise was also devastated by the war. After the victory, Lushan will inevitably restore its former prosperity. Chairman [Chiang] himself has never forgotten this important place that is suitable for both escaping the summer heat and discussing the overall situation. He himself flew to Jiujiang and then transferred to Lushan on the morning of the 14th, and Madame Chiang also followed that afternoon. Important Chinese and foreign figures will arrive successively. It is heard that Lushan has once again become a political center of the moment. Not only that, but Chinese and foreign journalists have to move their base from Nanjing to Lushan to conduct major activities.

In order to understand the latest situation of this summer resort, this reporter specifically visited Mr. Peng Mingde of the China Travel Service, who recently returned from Lushan. According to him: "This scenic spot with clear mountains and waters is still intact. The central area of Lushan can be considered to have not suffered much damage. Only many houses in the rear were bombed and collapsed, and the windows and doors were taken away by local farmers to be used as firewood." This immediately reminded me of the stone steps of Lushan, layer upon layer, with a dangerous terrain. At a mountain corner south of the Moon Bow Trench, directly overlooking the bottom of the mountain, are engraved the words "Realm of Joyful Excursion." The tennis courts, swimming pool, and clean and spacious stone-paved roads of Guling, especially that vast expanse of white mist, as if riding the clouds and driving the fog, truly give one the feeling of "difficulty in seeing the true face of Lushan." It is said that these beautiful sceneries have not changed in the nine years. After the Lushan Management Bureau took over last winter, the roads have been repaired and paved with Sanhe soil. The pavilions along the road have green paint and red roofs, which are very bright. Except for one or two places in the swimming pool that have become dry ponds or piles of rubble, the rest are still a pool of clear water. The tennis courts are also as before. The streets are gradually becoming lively, and shops have begun to stand side by side. Several cafes and tea rooms have been opened. In the past, prices were always several times higher than in Shanghai, but now they are more than half lower than in Shanghai. However, supplies are still quite scarce. If you can bring a few dozen beers to send to friends, it is more welcome than anything else. Lushan, which has always been praised for its perfect public security, is now even more advanced. The military and police forces are very strong and have undergone strict training. Even the sedan chair carriers must be assessed and guaranteed by the labor union. This time, the Chairman's Attendant Room and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent people there three weeks ago to arrange, repair, and rectify. The Chairman's official residence, and residences were prepared for Marshal Ma and government officials. The war zone service group specially found the most elegant hostel in Guling to entertain foreign guests. During the period of occupation, the Chairman's official residence was occupied by Germans and later moved into by a French priest, so the house was considered to have not been damaged much, but a lot of furniture was moved away. The Chairman and his wife's private cars were transported to Jiujiang a week ago, and the two specially-made sedan chairs have also been renovated.

Currently, there are about 8,000 people living on the mountain. In addition to the local residents, most are members of the Central Training Corps and the Three Principles of the People Youth League, civil servants who serve in the organization there, and homeowners who have been sent there to inspect or arrange things. Before the war, about 30,000 people went to Lushan every year to escape the summer heat. It is expected that at least more than 10,000 people will revisit the place this year.

In terms of transportation, much has also been restored. You can take the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ship from Shanghai to Jiujiang, which takes about four days and three nights. In addition, China National Aviation Corporation also has daily flights back and forth once a day, except for Sundays. From Jiujiang to Lianhua Cave at the foot of the mountain, the China Travel Service office has resumed operations and has special cars for transportation, costing only 4,000 yuan per person. In addition, the Jiangxi Highway Bureau also has passenger cars. When you arrive at Lianhua Cave, the China Travel Service has prepared mountain sedan chairs to take you to your destination, so you can comfortably spend the summer. However, it is said that finding accommodation is very difficult and you must make arrangements in advance.

Finally, I also remember that in the past, when the sun set on the mountain, I often saw the elegant figures of the Chairman and his wife strolling on the street, just like Lushan, symbolizing the peaceful atmosphere of universal joy. It is rumored that the Three-Person Conference may be held in Lushan. If this can become a reality, it is indeed the most suitable place. I believe that good news that we have been waiting for a long time will soon come from this scenic spot.

### The Flood in Wuxian County is Getting Worse. The Tragedy of 1931 [Republican Calendar: 1931 AD] is About to Be Repeated. The Han River Water Level Reaches Over 25 Meters

[Our Correspondent in Suzhou, 14th] The flood in this county is getting worse day by day. In addition to more than 10,000 mu of farmland being submerged in the villages of Xuqiao and Ducun in the Fifth District, the ten-mile-long dike from Fengqiao to Huqiu Pass in the Fourth District has also been washed away. The low-lying fields next to the dike are a vast expanse of water, and the flooding is quite extensive. In the Thirteenth District of Western Jiangsu, due to the sharp rise in the water level of Taihu Lake and the torrential mountain floods, all the farmland in the district will become a swamp. The tragic scene of the great flood of 1931 [Republican calendar] is about to be repeated.

[Our Correspondent in Hankou, 14th] The water level in Hankou City continues to rise to 25.382 meters, and the situation is becoming more and more urgent. Chairman Wan [of the local government] recently telegraphed the counties in central Hubei to mobilize civilian labor to repair the dikes.

[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 14th] According to a telegram from Suiyuan this morning, due to the high water level of the Yellow River and the turbulent water flow, many canals have breached. In addition, there was heavy rain here on the evening of the 11th, which has not stopped as of this afternoon.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 13th] The project to block the breach and restore the dike at Huayuankou is still in full swing. Although 30 rows of the breach have been washed away, the stone-throwing work has reached more than one-half. Some sections of the bottom stone are aligned, and the breach is in a state of being blocked. The work on the diversion canal has not yet started because the Communist side still insists on different opinions. The old dike within 20 miles west of the Xiaocheng West School in Caoxian County has not been repaired due to repeated harassment by the Communist army recently, and hundreds of workers have been kidnapped by the Communist army.

### Chairman Qian Changzhao of the National Resources Commission Discusses the Issue of Taiwan Sugar Prices. The Original Intention of Raising Wholesale Prices Was to Curb Speculation. He Urgently Hopes That Sugar Merchants Can Cooperate with the Taiwan Sugar Company

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] Regarding the issue of sugar prices sold by the Taiwan Sugar Industry Company, which is jointly operated by the National Resources Commission and the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office, various parties have been paying close attention recently. This reporter specifically visited the National Resources Commission. The Commission has always taken the interests of the general public as the premise in handling various undertakings. When the Taiwan Sugar Company started selling sugar, it was also given clear instructions to pay attention to stabilizing sugar prices on the one hand to reduce the burden on direct consumers, and on the other hand, to protect the reasonable profits of sugar merchants. From May 24 to June 6, three batches were sold in succession. The wholesale price was 66,000 yuan per city dan [unit of weight]. During this period, the market price hovered around 70,000 yuan, which was extremely stable. After that, due to the obstruction of transportation between Taiwan and Shanghai, Taiwan Sugar could not be shipped to Shanghai continuously, and the inventory gradually decreased, resulting in large fluctuations in market prices. The company was afraid that the distance between the wholesale price and the market price was too far, which might breed speculation, so it appropriately increased the wholesale price, but it was always lower than the normal market price. Although this method has considerable reasons, it is not enough to fully implement the purpose of the Commission to stabilize prices. The Commission has now ordered the company to follow the instructions of the Commission and work hard. If there are any special fluctuations in the market sugar price again, it should consult with the Shanghai municipal authorities to help stop it. Currently, Taiwan Sugar has arrived in Shanghai one after another.

### Refugees from Northern Jiangsu Fleeing to Nanjing Register with the Homecoming Association. Demand the Release of the Four Refugees in the Ma [Xulun] Case

[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 14th] The thirty million refugees in northern Jiangsu, recently, because of the Communist army's large-scale attacks in northern Jiangsu, scattered and intruded everywhere, and there is no hope of returning home. Yesterday, they specifically telegraphed Chairman Chiang [Kai-shek], requesting him to exert force to suppress the rebellion. In addition, the Jiangsu Provincial Provisional Assembly urgently resolved on the 14th to telegraph the central government to urge the Communist Party to withdraw from northern Jiangsu as soon as possible to relieve the disaster.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 14th] The Northern Jiangsu Refugees Returning Home Promotion Association in Nanjing, in order to promote its affairs and strengthen its work, will handle the following matters from now on: (1) Registering refugees. The method is based on the county as a unit. The fellow villagers' associations or relief associations in each county will register the refugees' names, ages, detailed addresses in Nanjing, and the course of their displacement, and submit them to the association within four days for relief. (2) Li Yunru, the former administrative inspector and security commander of the Seventh District of Jiangsu, and three others, were captured by the Central Government one after another and held in Huaide and Yan'an after the fall of Lianghuai in September last year. Their families, based on the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference to release political prisoners, have repeatedly requested the Communist Party to release them, but have not been granted permission. The families of these people are in dire straits and came to the association to ask for relief. It is heard that the association has decided to donate funds to the military and political authorities and Li's friendly fellow villagers, which will be collected and forwarded by the association. (3) The four suspected refugees arrested in the Ma Xulun case should have been released without guilt according to the minor injury. However, the prosecutor actually prosecuted them for the crime of disrupting public order, which is inconsistent with the facts. Because Ma and others are representatives of the people, not civil servants, and did not come to Nanjing to perform official duties, the refugees were motivated by righteous indignation and committed this act of insult. The circumstances are understandable. In addition to the defense lawyer Cui Peijun's defense, the association also hired fellow villager lawyer Liu Bochang to assist in the defense. In addition, three representatives from the board of directors will prepare a petition and go to the district court next Monday to request bail.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] Gan Naiguang, the special envoy who went to the Philippines to participate in the Independence Day ceremony, gave a speech saying that the local overseas Chinese were extremely excited to see airplanes with national emblems from their motherland. After the delegation got off the plane, it was accompanied by Consul General Duan Maolan and representatives of the overseas Chinese to visit the residential areas of the overseas Chinese and received a warm welcome from the overseas Chinese. One of the most profound impressions I got was July 4. On that day, no less than 100,000 people participated in the celebration.

President Roxas said that the Philippine government will soon establish diplomatic relations with China. The conclusion of the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship will take some time due to technical reasons, and Consul General Duan and the Philippine side are continuing to negotiate. The commercial treaty will be concluded after the Treaty of Friendship. The Philippine government has also proposed setting up a Philippine consulate in Xiamen to facilitate the return of overseas Chinese to the Philippines.

### Local Communications. The Jiangsu Provincial Government Telegraphs the Executive Yuan. To Save the Crisis in the Silk Industry

[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang] The Jiangsu Provincial Government recently submitted a telegram from Xue Mingjian, the chairman of the South Jiangsu District Branch of the China National Federation of Industries, on behalf of the industry, stating that silk merchants are unable to start work. The situation has been reported to the central government, requesting an appropriation of funds and purchasing silk at cost to avert the crisis. The original telegram is excerpted as follows: "To the President Song and Vice President Weng of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing: This case is based on the telegram from Xue Mingjian, the chairman of the South Jiangsu District Branch of the China National Federation of Industries, on behalf of the industry, which roughly states: According to the letter from Gao Jingxi, the chairman of the Wuxi Silk Weaving Industry Association, Wuxi is the most developed area in the country for the silk industry. Every spring and autumn silkworm season, the rural economy and social finance all rely on turnover, which is extremely important. However, the purchase price of spring silkworms this year is about 140,000 yuan per city dan [unit of weight]. Calculated at 280 catties dried, plus various expenses, each city dan of dry cocoons requires 558,600 yuan. Calculated at 500 city catties of spun yarn, the raw material of each dan of raw silk has reached 2,793,000 yuan. Furthermore, due to the increase in rice and fuel prices in Xidi, the spinning cost per dan, including car rental interest, packaging consumption, etc., requires more than 1.3 million yuan. Therefore, if the raw silk spun by each factory is compared with the silk market, each dan will lose at least more than one million yuan, resulting in many factories being unable to start work. Fellow traders have repeatedly appealed to us. We can only piously request the government to borrow spinning funds, so that the received silkworms will not be placed here forever, and to start work first, and then the government will buy raw silk in exchange for foreign exchange to maintain the business and provide relief, etc. After inquiry, the decline of the silk market is indeed a serious problem for our country's economy. The points mentioned are all important, and we telegraphed earnestly, hoping to approve it as stated, and the urgency of waiting for orders is unsurpassed, etc. Based on this, the local government had previously reported to the Executive Yuan that the silk industry this year had encountered a major crisis, and that agriculture and commerce were both in trouble, which was unprecedented. We have telegraphed to the Executive Yuan, requesting that factory silk be purchased at cost in order to save the case. According to the previous situation reported in the telegram, it is indeed a necessary measure to rescue the silk industry. We propose to request a quick approval and order the competent authority to implement it immediately to avert the crisis."

The relationship between France and the Viet Minh in the French Union's institutions should be based on a free association between them, with both having legal equality and working together to protect common interests, without stating that the two countries also share the same democratic and social ideals.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th] The Constitutional Draft Committee of the French National Constituent Assembly met today to discuss the issue of the French Union. Chairman Félix Gouin stated: Defining the new French Union too strictly would be dangerous for the time being. This union is a union of countries and peoples, contributing their resources and efforts to develop civilization, increase welfare, and ensure security. Within this union, each country's achievements with France should either lead them to the status of a free state or determine their position within the French state according to their wishes. One member proposed that the people of the union should be divided into three categories according to their degree of autonomy: (1) Associated people, referring to the currently autonomous people; (2) Federal people, who have lost their autonomy but still retain individual personality; (3) Protected people, who, after consultation, would be willing to join the Republic.

### Byrnes Returns, Broadcast Scheduled in Washington Today, Reporting on the Paris Conference

[Reuters, Washington, 14th] U.S. Secretary of State James Byrnes flew back to the United States yesterday afternoon after attending the Four Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris and is now scheduled to deliver a broadcast to the nation on Monday night.

[TASS, Moscow, 13th] Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov returned to Moscow from Paris today.

[Reuters, London, 13th] Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin returned to London from Paris today, appearing tired and unwilling to speak to reporters. Bevin's pessimistic expression and Byrnes' optimistic tone do not necessarily indicate different views on the Foreign Ministers Conference. The main reason lies in the different personalities of the two men, leading to different reactions.

[United Press, Washington, 13th] Secretary of State James Byrnes, having just returned from Paris, immediately took further action regarding the limited achievements of the conference. Before boarding the plane in Paris, Byrnes said that he would report the results of the conference to the American people on Monday night after returning home. Byrnes also stated that the United States, in the interest of peace, had accepted some compromises on the European treaties at the Foreign Ministers Conference. Byrnes also announced that he intends to meet again with the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, Britain, and France before the United Nations General Assembly convenes in New York on September 23. According to Byrnes, the internationalization plan for the Port of Trieste is a major test to see if the United Nations organization has a solution to this kind of situation. According to well-informed sources, Byrnes originally had four major unresolved issues to address before attending the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, but only one has now been resolved. Relations between the Soviet Union and the Western countries are still shrouded in uncertainty. Byrnes' desire to finalize a treaty with Austria as soon as possible and to establish a better agreement on the German issue was blocked by Molotov. As a result, the four-nation分区 occupation of Germany is likely to continue indefinitely. The United States has already spent over 20 billion yuan on this over the past year. In addition, the occupying forces will remain stationed in Austria indefinitely. As for other issues, such as the treaties with Italy and other countries, only partial progress has been made, and the disposition of Italian territories remains unresolved.

The U.S. is now trying to find a way to allow 100,000 Jews to immigrate to Palestine from Europe. However, the British side insists that the recommendations in the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry report must be fully implemented. If the discussion results in each recommendation being fully implemented according to its literal meaning, it will be established as joint Anglo-American policy.

[Reuters, Washington, 13th] The War Department announced that talks with Japanese leaders who ended the war with Japan and persuaded them to accept unconditional surrender revealed that the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not the main reasons for Japan's defeat.

[United Press, Washington, 14th] General Jacob L. Devers, Commander of the U.S. Army Ground Forces, stated in a speech to the Third Division Association last night: "The results of post-war research and inventions in the U.S. will produce a new type of infantry division that is highly mobile and fully armed. If we want to maintain peace, we must be able to act immediately and quickly quell any source of unrest. To achieve this goal, we may need to widely use aircraft as a means of transporting soldiers to any battlefield. At that time, soldiers will be equipped with the best weapons and new uniforms, which can greatly reduce casualties, and artillery support will make wider use of radio-guided missiles. Although soldiers of the future will be affected by various new inventions, I firmly believe that we must still transport infantry to the ground to exert their strength in order to achieve final victory." He also previously disclosed that the Army Ordnance Department has produced a bulletproof vest.

[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] MacArthur released his recent administrative report on the occupied territories today, stating: The Yoshida Cabinet was formed on May 20, which is another step in the normal development of the Diet. This move was taken entirely in a democratic manner. Political negotiations are no longer limited to secret talks between senior officials and those around the palace, but are openly discussed by various parties and published in newspapers. As for the United Nations' censorship of Japanese news, its main task is to ensure that the old military閥 and militaristic forces no longer impose on Japanese newspapers and other reporting matters. Now is not the time to relax censorship. Japanese newspapers are still trying to defend Japan's war position, and at this time, they are beginning to imply that major reparations are unfair.

The report stated that the spread of these two diseases is unprecedented and cannot be contained without the widespread establishment of hospitals. Deaths from tuberculosis in countries such as Poland and Greece are four times higher than before the war. In general, the health conditions in Northern Europe are better than in Southern Europe. Typhoid fever is rarely found in Europe, which is very different from the situation after World War I. The widespread use of DDT is also one of the reasons.

He previously served as an advisor to the Chongqing Insurance Trade Association and is familiar with the difficulties faced by the private industrial and commercial sectors. He also has frequent contact with the government and deeply understands the government's difficulties. In the future, he is willing to serve as a bridge of communication between the private industrial and commercial sectors and the government. At the same time, he hopes to do more practical things and say less empty words. If he cannot actively help the private industrial and commercial sectors, he will at least do fewer bad things in a passive manner. He congratulated the federation on its future success.

#### Pan Gongzhan

Central Committee Member Pan Gongzhan then delivered a speech, stating that he was attending the meeting as a reporter for a newspaper. He felt honored to be invited by Chairman Luo to deliver a speech. He would like to briefly offer a few observations: (1) The power of organization is the greatest. Fighting alone is no longer suitable in the modern era. Old-fashioned commercial institutions in China had organizations, but they had not yet developed into national federations. He congratulated the federation on taking the lead. (2) If China wants to embark on the path of industrialization and modernization in the future, the development of the insurance industry is a key factor. Entrepreneurs will not have to bear unexpected risks and can operate their businesses according to predetermined plans. The insurance industry distributes and bears risks, thus avoiding setbacks caused by unexpected risks for entrepreneurs. In the future, the insurance industry should focus on this point and assist in the development of industry and commerce. (3) He hopes that all businesses, regardless of size, will embrace the mentality of collective security. The insurance industry also bears part of the responsibility of the financial industry. He hopes that in the future, they will plan a collective security system based on the spirit of solidarity to lay the initial foundation for future development. He hopes that China's insurance industry will occupy its due position in China and the world market.

#### Lu Jingshi

Lu Jingshi, representative of the Ministry of Social Affairs, then delivered a speech. Lu expressed three points: First, he represented the ministry in congratulating the inaugural meeting. Second, he hopes that after the establishment of the joint organization, it will raise its own fair and pressing issues to seek reasonable solutions with the government. Third, he hopes that the spirit of the meeting will be carried through to the end and that the articles of association and resolutions will be jointly observed.

Representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce also delivered speeches. Representatives from Shanghai, Kunming, Chongqing, Nanjing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, and Qingdao then expressed their opinions in turn. The main points are summarized as follows: (1) Standardize insurance policies nationwide. (2) Improve the stamp tax issue on insurance policies with the authorities. (3) Promote the importance of the insurance business to the government, public opinion, and the general public. (4) Establish vocational schools for insurance, cultivating professionals. (5) The insurance industry should find ways to improve its character, cultivate a solemn spirit, and correct its past shortcomings.

The inaugural meeting ceremony concluded at 12:00 noon. The Chongqing and Kunming Insurance Trade Associations then jointly hosted a luncheon for the attending representatives. At 2:30 PM, the meeting continued, first passing the full articles of association and the declaration of the inaugural meeting. The main points of the declaration are as follows: (1) The importance of the insurance industry to society. (2) Explaining the purpose and mission of the federation. (3) Goals to strive for after establishment: A. Insurance autonomy movement. B. Cooperation between state-owned and private enterprises. C. Collecting statistical materials. D. Improving cultural standards. E. Striving for political status.

#### Proposals Passed

Subsequently, eighteen proposals were passed in succession. The important ones are excerpted as follows: (1) Send a telegram to Chairman Chiang to express respect. (2) Petition the government to convene a national economic conference as soon as possible to save China's economic crisis. (3) The National Assembly is about to be convened, and it is proposed to request the government to allow the federation to elect three representatives from the quota of social elites to contribute (it was resolved to recommend Luo Beichen, Chen Yisheng, and Ding Yunnong). (4) Petition the government to amend the method of affixing stamps to insurance policies to be fair. (5) Petition the government to amend the Insurance Law and the Insurance Industry Law as soon as possible, promulgate and implement them, and request the Legislative Yuan to allow the federation to send personnel to attend the amendment meetings and express their opinions. All reinsurance should first be distributed to domestic businesses to complete the autonomous insurance market. (6) The insurance business has a special nature, and it is proposed to request the Ministry of Finance to issue a notice to local direct tax bureaus that the business tax and profit tax of the insurance industry should be paid by the company as a whole. (7) Formulate national insurance rate regulations and terms to standardize them and prevent disputes. (8) Petition the Ministry of Finance to strictly implement the order for foreign insurance companies to register within a limited time to maintain credibility. (9) Petition the Ministry of Education to approve the establishment of a Chinese Insurance College to cultivate insurance talents. Provisional suggestions include: (1) Petition the government to abolish all wartime laws and regulations related to insurance and their implementing rules. (2) Establish a national welfare undertaking to benefit insurance employees. (3) Establish a Southern Branch of the federation to facilitate work. Finally, the directors and supervisors were elected. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM. At 7:00 PM last night, the Central Trust Bureau hosted a dinner for all the attending representatives. At 11:00 AM today, the first board meeting of the federation will be held on the eighth floor of the Jinmen Hotel to discuss how to implement the resolutions passed by the general meeting.

### French National Day: French Community's Grand Gathering, Drunken Revelry

[Our Report] The French community in this city enthusiastically celebrated National Day yesterday. At 10:00 AM, the French Consul-General, Mr. Payart, hosted the French community at the French Consulate on Jinling Road. At 10:30 AM, he continued to hold a cocktail party to entertain foreign envoys and guests from all walks of life. Mayor Wu, Secretary-General He Dekui, American Consul David, and other consuls and heads of various departments, totaling about 200 people, attended. At 11:30 AM and 1:00 PM in the afternoon, there were grand banquets at the Cercle Sportif Français on Route Vallon and the former French Club on Route Mercier, where the French community reveled drunkenly. At 3:30 PM, Mr. Payart awarded the Knight of the Legion of Honor, the highest French honor, to Englishman Eric Davis on the French warship "La Grandière," in recognition of his diligent efforts and suffering of torture for the French during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai. The ceremony was solemn and grand.

### Investigation into the Cause of the Central Air Transport Corporation Accident: Due to a Sudden Engine Failure, Chen Wenkuan Returns to Shanghai from Peiping, Calamity Strikes Again During Descent, Wing Touches Wire, Resulting in a Major Disaster

[Our Report] The special plane sent by the Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) to investigate the cause of the "No. 15" plane accident safely returned to Longhua Airport at 2:25 PM yesterday afternoon. Chen Wenkuan, the director of the flight crew who went to investigate and served as the pilot himself, immediately spoke to our reporter at his request about the truth of the "No. 15" plane accident: About ten minutes after the plane took off from Jinan Airport, the pilot discovered that the return air pipe of the left wing engine suddenly caught fire, causing an obstacle. At that time, he telegraphed to Jinan Station, saying, "The return air pipe is on fire, and we intend to return immediately." The station's telegraph operator mistakenly thought that the engine was on fire, hence the rumor of a "fire." When the plane returned and reached the airspace above the airport, the altitude was 200 feet. Just as it was about to land, it saw several Chinese Air Force P-51 fighter planes parked in front of the airport. In order to avoid crashing into the Air Force planes, the pilot Shen Huade retracted the landing gear again and planned to circle the airport once before landing again. When the plane made a left turn and circled 180 degrees, the malfunctioning left engine suddenly stopped completely. The plane's altitude suddenly dropped to more than 50 feet. At this time, the drooping left wing touched the telephone line along the road, causing the entire left wing (including the engine) to be cut off immediately and thrown more than a zhang away, where it caught fire and was destroyed. After the fuselage fell to the ground, the right wing engine was still running non-stop. The pilot's cabin on the nose of the plane and the fuselage had separated into two sections at this time and shattered upon impact, causing the co-pilot and radio operator to die instantly. The pilot was seriously injured and died that evening.

In summary, the main reason was the sudden engine failure. As for why the engine failed so suddenly, the company's senior officials are still investigating. It seems that it was caused by some kind of unavoidable reason.

### Wang Ruoxi's Remains Buried in Jinan

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 14th] Wang Ruoxi, a special envoy of the Ministry of Transportation's Northeast Telecommunications, died unfortunately in an air crash in Jinan on the 12th. His remains were buried in Jinan on the 13th and temporarily placed in the Hunan Guild Hall. He Siyuan and others have reported this matter to the central government and notified his family.

### C-46 Planes Continue to Fly as Usual

After the accident, before the cause was known, the Central Air Transport Corporation took an emergency measure, ordering all C-46 planes to temporarily stop flying to prevent any accidents. China Airlines also expressed deep concern about the engine fire problem of C-46 planes. If this defect is confirmed, all C-46 planes will be completely unusable. Fortunately, it has now been proven that the engine fire was not caused by structural defects, but by an accidental and irresistible reason. Therefore, the senior aviation personnel of the two airlines expressed relief after hearing this. The Central Air Transport Corporation has ordered C-46 planes to take off as usual. All routes have not been suspended in the past two days and will continue to operate as usual.

### Zou Lumin, Who Was Brought Back, Suffered Minor Head and Foot Injuries

[Another Dispatch] When Director Chen Wenkuan's investigative plane returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon, it carried passengers and goods from Peiping, Jinan, and Nanjing, and brought back a passenger named Zou Lumin, who suffered minor injuries, from Jinan. Zou is from Suzhou and has been urgently telegraphed by the company to Zou's relatives in Sixianzi Alley, Suzhou, to report his safety. He was immediately sent to the China-America Hospital in this city for treatment. According to the medical examination, Zou's condition is very good. Zou went to the third branch of the Central Film Studio in Peiping to discuss official business and was unfortunately injured en route. He said that eight people died immediately after the plane crash, and seven more died in the hospital. Wang Junpei, the deputy commander of the 12th Army, suffered a serious heart contusion and died late at night. The injuries of the other injured people are minor and they remain in Jinan for treatment. There were four uninjured passengers who continued to fly to Peiping at 5:50 PM on the 13th and arrived safely at 7:35 PM that night. Zou also mentioned the company's post-accident arrangements, saying: "The company's handling of the injured passengers was prompt, appropriate, and enthusiastic. We are extremely grateful. After the accident, the company immediately transported the injured to the hospital for treatment and did its best." Director Chen Wenkuan also visited the injured one by one after flying to Jinan and gave them fruits, cigarettes, and other foods. He Siyuan, chairman of Shandong Province, and General Wang Yaowu also came to visit them. It was also learned that there were two children among the passengers who survived, both only three or four years old, whose parents also died when the plane crashed.

### As Small as a Glass of Milk: Containing Serious Problems, Shanghai's Dairy Production is on the Verge of Collapse

Before the Pacific War, many people could afford fresh milk. But now, as long as you have money, a phone call will do - even for Codo’s A-grade milk.

This isn’t a good phenomenon. Like many local industries, Shanghai’s dairy production is being forced into collapse. The reasons are well known: foreign goods are being dumped and milk

**Commercial News: Production Tools Approved for Foreign Exchange Settlement; Import Time Limit May Be Extended; Vice Minister Pan of the Ministry of Economic Affairs Arrives in Shanghai for Discussions**

[Report from Our Newspaper] Pan Xulun, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago via the early train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway for official business. Our newspaper reporter specially visited him to inquire about the purpose of this trip. He informed us that the Central Bank currently stipulates that foreign exchange that has been approved for sale must be used to ship the imported goods purchased abroad to Shanghai within three months, after which the approval becomes invalid. However, it has been found that the shipping time for foreign machinery and other production tools often exceeds three months, and in some cases, even extends to a year. Therefore, the Central Bank's original regulations effectively prohibit the import of machinery. On the other hand, various non-essential consumer goods can arrive on schedule. The resulting impact will cause setbacks for domestic machinery production enterprises. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, recognizing this situation, sent him to Shanghai to discuss improvement measures with the Central Bank, in order to adjust the effective period for foreign exchange settlement for the purchase of machinery, promote the import of production tools as much as possible, and simultaneously limit the influx of non-essential consumer goods. The reporter also inquired about the gains from the recent National Economic Planning Committee meeting. He stated that the meeting had resulted in many preliminary resolutions on national economic infrastructure plans, which are awaiting gradual implementation. However, before there are actual results, he does not want to engage in empty talk and hopes to reveal the results to the nation in the future.

**Procedures for Securities Listing Application**

**Securities Exchange Preparatory Committee to Start Processing Applications Today**

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Preparatory Committee for the Shanghai Securities Exchange has decided to begin accepting securities listing applications today. Any Chinese limited liability company, limited partnership company, or foreign company operating within China that has obtained legal person status in accordance with the Chinese Company Law, whose issued shares or corporate bonds comply with the securities listing regulations in the operating rules (detailed regulations available upon request), can directly obtain a securities listing application form and registration items from the Preparatory Committee (a printing fee of 2,000 yuan will be charged per copy), fill it out according to the prescribed format, and submit it along with all supporting documents to the Committee for review. After review and approval by the Ministry, the securities can be listed for trading. As of yesterday, the Committee had issued more than 1,200 broker application forms, of which more than 200 were for legal persons and approximately 1,000 were for individuals. The Committee is currently busy with market construction work. The renovation and remodeling are being undertaken by various construction companies through bidding. The bidding will be opened and work will begin within days, and it is expected to be completed in about a month. Regarding telephone issues, the Committee has contacted the telephone company and secured 1,200 pairs of lines, which are currently being installed and renovated concurrently. In the future, there will also be broadcasting equipment, using the latest machines to fill the entire venue with clear sound waves at any time, quickly and efficiently, without any obstacles. This plan has been closely coordinated with the telephone company, with the aim of completing it as quickly as possible.

**Director of the Currency Department to Come to Shanghai to Oversee Bank Business Inspection**

The Ministry of Finance, concerned about the active financial speculation in the Shanghai market and recent instability among some banks and financial institutions, has specially dispatched Dai Mingli, Director of the Currency Department, to be responsible for overseeing the inspection of the business operations of all banks in the city for the first half of this year, with assistance from personnel from the Central Bank. At the same time, the Central Bank will reduce the amount of interbank lending as much as possible to tighten the money supply and gradually shrink floating capital. It is reported that starting today, the above measures will be further implemented.

**Who is Raising Sugar Prices?**

**Statement from the Sugar Industry Association**

Since the establishment of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, sugar prices have gradually increased. The responsibility for this lies with whom? Various parties have expressed opinions. Yesterday, the person in charge of the Sugar Industry Association stated that the fluctuation of sugar prices is a factual matter. For example, the initial sugar price set by the Corporation was 66,000 yuan per picul, which was already 10,000 yuan higher than the sugar sold wholesale by the Enemy Property Administration of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. On June 19th, when the demand for sugar was high, the Corporation still had more than 20,000 bags in stock but claimed to have no sugar to stimulate the market. The next day, the market price was 96,000 yuan. The Corporation then raised the price by another 2,000 yuan and sold more than 3,000 bags at 98,000 yuan, and did not follow its public announcement procedures. It is clear that these actions are the cause of the sugar market fluctuations.

**Rayon: 6,000 Cases Sold**

**Large Quantities Still Sealed**

The Enemy Property Administration has entrusted the China Textile Corporation to publicly sell enemy-owned rayon. Since last month, a new listing has been made once a week. Several batches have now been sold. According to the Corporation's statistics, as of the 15th of this month, the total number of cases sold has reached 6,000. The quantity of enemy-owned rayon in storage is very large. The Corporation is actively working with the Jianghai Customs to inventory the stock, and will continue to sell it in the future.

**Turmeric Exports Still Stagnant**

**Appeal to Government for Assistance**

[Report from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 14th] In Sichuan Province, besides raw silk, tung oil, white wax, and pork, turmeric is also a major export commodity. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the turmeric produced in various counties in southern Sichuan was difficult to transport due to traffic blockages, resulting in large stockpiles that were almost considered waste. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, turmeric merchants were temporarily active, hoping to have the opportunity to export the goods they had accumulated at the lowest prices. However, for the past year, transportation problems have remained unresolved due to restoration and grain transportation, and foreign merchants have rarely inquired, resulting in a stagnant situation again. It is reported that the inventory in the Shuibin area alone is over 100,000 tons. Turmeric merchants and local financial figures are actively organizing export companies and appealing to the government to approve loans or purchases to provide assistance.

**United States Raises Tung Oil Prices**

**41 Cents Per Pound**

**Exports Have Been More Active Lately**

Since the United States announced the abolition of price controls, US prices have gradually increased. Our export medicines, stimulated by this, have also gradually become more active, especially tung oil exports. Tung oil exporters recently received a telegram from New York stating that the price of tung oil has risen from 38 cents per pound to 40 to 41 cents. Therefore, tung oil sales have been more active lately. According to sources in plant oil factories, before the war, our country's tung oil exports were over 65,000 tons. However, since the victory, it has been more than ten months, and only about 6,000 tons of tung oil have been shipped from this port. Currently, the US market has raised tung oil prices. According to the calculation of 41 cents per pound, exports are more possible. Therefore, the factory is currently requesting the government to provide as much assistance as possible for tung oil transportation to ensure that a large amount of tung oil is shipped to Shanghai.

**Production and Sales Statistics**

**Sichuan Cassia in Abundant Supply**

According to Zhang Yuqiu, Secretary-General of the Import and Export Trade Association, the production of our country's tung oil has been reduced due to the destruction and control by the Japanese. The lowest reduction is 25%, and the highest is 75%. The overall calculation is 50%. The original production was 75,000 metric tons per year. Last year, it only reached 40,000 metric tons, which must be reduced by 10,000 metric tons for domestic sales. This year's exports can reach 30,000 metric tons. Since the victory until the end of June this year, the amount shipped has reached 8,500 metric tons, of which 6,000 metric tons were shipped from Shanghai, and the rest were shipped from Hong Kong. Of the above, 2,000 metric tons were shipped to the United Kingdom, 1,500 metric tons were shipped to the Soviet Union, and the rest were shipped to the United States. Zhang concluded that the production in the upstream areas of Wanxian and Guangxi is the most abundant, but unfortunately, it is stockpiled and cannot be transported out.

**Siamese Rice All Shipped to the United Kingdom**

**China, India, and Other Countries Lament Being Left Out**

**British Merchants Stockpiling for Chinese Merchants**

[United Press, Bangkok, 13th] Defeated Siam, relying on aid from that country due to widespread famine in Asia, has suddenly become a friendly nation to the United Kingdom and the United States. Siam previously declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States. In January of this year, Siam signed a treaty with the United Kingdom, agreeing to provide 1,500,000 tons of rice to the United Kingdom free of charge. This amount is the maximum possible export quantity of Siamese rice. As of April 30th, only 165,000 tons have been shipped, while China, India, and Malaya have not received a single grain. However, British food officials blame the Siamese government for being unable to do anything. Because most of the rice is in the hands of Chinese grain merchants, who intend to hoard and are unwilling to accept devalued Siamese currency, requiring payment in other foreign currencies.

**Australian Wool for Sale**

**But Must Be Paid for in Cash**

[United Press, Melbourne, 13th] Mr. Lai, Secretary of the Australian Wool Industry Committee, declared that Australia is prepared to sell any quantity of wool to any country that can pay cash (except for former Axis countries). He stated that China, Turkey, Iraq, India, and other countries have inquired, but transactions have been very difficult because most buyers are unable to pay cash.

**Prospects for Sino-Philippine Trade After Philippine Independence**

**Key is to Reduce Production Costs**

[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Daonan, Manager of the Bank of Communications, went to the Philippines shortly before the Pacific War to prepare for the establishment of a branch of the bank. He stayed in the Philippines for a long time and is very familiar with the economic and trade situation of the Philippine Islands. Yesterday, the reporter specially visited him to inquire about the development of trade between China and the Philippines after the independence of the Philippine Islands. He stated that although the Philippine Islands have declared independence this time, they still cannot but rely on the United States economically. Therefore, all policies will have special benefits for the United States. If our domestic products can be priced low, even if the Philippine Islands erect tariff barriers, they can still compete with American goods. Currently, the problem is how to reduce domestic production costs first, in order to facilitate the export of domestic products. China and the Philippines are geographically close. Moreover, 75% of the Philippine distributors are overseas Chinese, who will definitely help promote Sino-Philippine trade. It is hoped that our country will not abandon the Nanyang market. Then, the prospects for Sino-Philippine trade will definitely be bright and far-reaching. The reporter inquired about the impact of Roxas's recent election as President of the Philippines on Sino-Philippine trade. He stated that Osmeña, who lost the election this time, is of overseas Chinese descent and is gentle in personality, but is very friendly to the overseas Chinese. Roxas, the elected president, is young and energetic, resolute in nature, and a lawyer by profession, so he is very familiar with financial and economic matters. However, Filipinos are mostly politicians who prioritize the implementation of their national policies when in power. Therefore, their policies often contradict their thoughts and cannot be judged uniformly. The reporter then inquired about the amount of remittances from overseas Chinese in the Philippine Islands to China after the victory. He estimated that from July to the end of last year, the amount of these remittances has exceeded at least 10 million US dollars. This has made a great contribution to China. This year, due to the gradual improvement of Sino-Philippine transportation, remittances are mostly brought in person by overseas Chinese, so the amount of remittances has decreased compared to before.

**Crisis Lurks in the Woolen Fabric Industry**

Before the past ten years, the woolen fabric industry had a balance between supply and demand, and transactions were mostly accommodated by sellers to buyers. In the industry, people interacted with each other on credit, and zero retail prices were all aimed at legitimate profits. When the market fluctuated, it was even more difficult to make a profit. Most had to package deals (i.e., guarantee that buyers would not lose money. If they did, they could cut it off, but it was stated that it was only limited to three or five days). Therefore, every year-end inventory settlement, although there was a surplus, it was very limited. After the outbreak of World War II, the transportation of woolen fabrics disappeared. At the same time, the production of this factory was both scarce and inferior. Due to various environmental factors, the prices of all goods soared. Woolen fabrics were certainly no exception. The market prices increased sharply, even changing three times a day. More and more outsiders joined in hoarding. Once sold, it was not easy to replenish. General cargo owners were all hoarding. The business strategy changed dramatically. There was a feeling that the diligent were laughed at by the lazy. Because hoarding could make huge profits, and diligent buying and selling would reduce inventory. At the same time, the buyer was the one who accommodated the seller. If the buyer did not accommodate the seller, even if they had money, there would be no goods to buy. At this time, all large and small companies made profits, especially those on Qipan Street. Now the environment has changed. Woolen fabric businesses, except for old stores with more than ten years of history, mostly feel that a crisis is lurking on all sides. It is quite difficult for small-scale firms to barely get through the end of 1946. The main reason is that public and private expenses have increased unabated, and the cost of eating is increasing. They also have to pay in cash. Limited funds are not enough to use. Interest rates are as high as 20%, and the principal and interest double in four months. The profits from buying and selling goods are not worth the losses. Currently, it is the hottest time of the year, belonging to the off-season. Interest rates are high, and expenses are high. So, those with a weak foundation or an unsound organization will all go bankrupt one after another. On the other hand, looking at all the woolen fabric factories in this city, except for China Textile, which occupies a special position (there are very few all-wool and fine-wool products, and the allocation prices are increasing round by round), the rest are all affected by raw materials and various environmental factors. Production cannot be restored. Most of the products are inferior coarse wool. Textile workers' wages are higher than those in other countries due to the high cost of living. The machinery and technology are all outdated ten years ago. The management and amortization costs all exceed those of British and American woolen fabrics. In the near future, British and American woolen fabrics will be shipped in one after another. At that time, the price of goods will inevitably plummet. General factories will not be able to survive, let alone compete. It is not too early for each to do so. The future is really unimaginable. (Shi)

**Board of Directors of Textile Construction**

**Minister Wang to Attend in Shanghai**

Wang Wentao, Minister of Economic Affairs, and Vice Minister Pan Xulun arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Beijing. Wang came to plan various economic constructions and attend the board meeting of China Textile Construction Corporation. He is scheduled to return to Beijing today.

It is also reported that China Textile Construction Corporation is now designing and increasing production in various factories to promote sales in Nanyang. It is reported that a large number of cotton yarns will be exported next week. The Corporation has also sent personnel to contact merchants in various parts of Nanyang for sales.

**Department Stores Concurrently Operating Similar Banking Business**

**Ministry of Finance Strictly Orders to Cease Operations Within a Time Limit**

The Ministry of Finance will uniformly ban all non-financial institutions operating banking businesses and has dispatched personnel to conduct strict investigations. According to reports, several department stores have been strictly ordered to close down and liquidate within a time limit because the deposit departments they have established operate similar banking businesses. All fixed deposits that have not yet reached maturity will be transferred to the Central Bank.

**Pinghu Watermelons Sell Well**

**Reasons for the Shortage of Taiwanese Watermelons**

The climate in this city has entered midsummer. The past two days have been extremely hot. Most of the watermelons on the market are from Pinghu products. Those from Sanlintang in Pudong are still too early. As for Taiwanese watermelons, which once appeared in this city two months ago, there is no trace of them at present. According to local goods merchants, it is still hoped that they will be shipped in one after another. However, in recent days, there have been few ships arriving in Shanghai from Taiwan. It is difficult for Japanese sailboats to transport them in a short period of time, and the freight is relatively expensive, resulting in a temporary shortage of Taiwanese watermelons. At the same time, the price of watermelons produced in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is indeed cheaper, so watermelon vendors in this city are competing to transport watermelons from the lake.

**Distribution Centers in Various Places Are Being Restored**

**About 100 Ford Cars Arrive in Shanghai**

**No Plans to Establish a Factory in China**

[Report from Our Newspaper] The reporter met with Richard, the Far East General Manager of Ford Motor Company, who recently arrived in Shanghai, to inquire about the company's current situation. According to him, since Henry Ford II, the grandson of the old Ford, took over, he has been seeking development. Since its founding, Ford Motor Company has produced 31 million vehicles. Now Henry is actively reorganizing and plans to break this record in the near future. The manufacturing policy will no longer focus on the beauty of the form but will strive for more practical value. Ford's products include Ford, Mercury, and Lincoln. Next year, a smaller Ford sedan with more transportation value and another heavy-duty truck will be manufactured. Currently, about 100 Ford military vehicles have arrived in Shanghai. The company has an assembly plant in Pudong, but it is very small. Since the victory, the import and export of automobiles has been limited. Recently, our government has banned the import of trucks, so the company currently has no plans to establish a factory in China. However, the major city distribution offices that were destroyed during the war are gradually being restored. The work will focus on repair services to assist in the restoration of our transportation. In addition, a large number of skilled workers will be trained.

**Rayon Manufacturing and National Defense Industry**

Fang Borong

(Editor's Note) The author went to Italy to study in May 1937, entered the Royal Fiber Research Institute, and studied rayon chemistry in the Department of Engineering Chemistry at the National Milan Polytechnic University. Not long after arriving in Italy, the Anti-Japanese War broke out in China, and relatives and friends in China were unable to take care of themselves, and financial assistance was cut off. Although he was in a difficult situation, he still worked hard to study and achieved great results. Later, he received a talent loan of 6,000 yuan in national currency from this newspaper for two years, which enabled him to continue his studies. In 1941, he graduated from the Italian Royal Fiber Research Institute and obtained a degree in chemical engineering and a doctorate in chemistry from the Italian National Milan Polytechnic University. He planned to return to China via the Soviet Union. When the German-Soviet War broke out, he tried to take a detour through the United States. He waited for a ship in San Francisco. The Pacific War broke out, and he had no choice but to return to New York, entered the Department of Electrical Chemistry at Columbia University, and studied electrical chemistry as a graduate student. At the same time, he worked for the Bras Co Company as the director of the chemical department and a design engineer. He invented the electrical dissolution of scrap steel and scrap iron. In view of the importance of rayon manufacturing to the national defense industry, he plans to send a letter of opinion to the motherland for the authorities to adopt. First, it is published in this newspaper for the reference of the Chinese people.

The emergence of rayon as a modern industry was after the First World War. According to reliable statistics, if the total production of cotton, wool, and silk is 100, the production of rayon accounted for only slightly less than 0.3% of the total 25 years ago, which is equivalent to two-thirds of the world's natural silk production. However, the production volume increased tenfold from 1920 to 1930, and then increased year by year. By 1942, its production figure was 60 times that of 1920, accounting for almost one-sixth of the world's clothing raw materials. The speed of its progress is not difficult to imagine! If we compare rayon with natural silk and wool, the production of rayon in 1942 was equivalent to that of wool, and it was 400 times that of the world's natural silk! We can foresee that the increase in rayon production in the future will be no problem, because rayon can not only be used to make clothing, but also has many other new industrial uses that natural raw materials do not have. For example, as a raw material for automobile tires, or for making rayon cotton, cellophane, and the chemical synthesis material industry, which is budding but rising rapidly.

There are now two new industries in the rayon industry, namely film and molded materials. The film industry and photography business require a huge amount of film. China's film industry is very young, and people's interest in photography is not widespread, but if people's lives are on the right track in the future, the demand is expected to be amazing. But if the rayon industry is not developed, the film industry cannot be talked about. Nitrocellulose is a necessity for carbon filaments in vacuum tubes, and it is widely used. It is an important raw material in the military industry. Molded materials made of acetic acid and nitrocellulose have opened up a new use for the rayon industry.

The molded material industry has not yet received the attention of the Chinese people. Although there are many raw materials for molded materials, the most important and largest molded materials come from phenol in the coal industry and a monoaldehyde made by comprehensive legal methods in the gas industry. Secondly, the molded materials made of cellulose acetate occupy a very important position. The close relationship between the molded material industry and modern life is beyond ordinary people's imagination. From daily necessities to airplanes and automobiles to water cups and buttons, there are thousands of kinds of items that can be made with molded materials. The use of molded materials to manufacture gears in machines to replace steel is also common. Because of its many uses and easy manufacturing, the use of molded materials to manufacture future house materials and food utensils can be expected. For example, the well-known "Nylon" is the glass stockings and all glass bags, shoes, hair combs, and trouser belts that are commonly seen on the market. The Chinese people only know how to enjoy it, but they don't know that it is the crystallization of the molded material industry. However, if there is no rayon factory, the molded material industry cannot obtain acetic acid and nitrocellulose raw materials.

Japan was originally a silkworm country, but because of its foresight, it has spared no effort in promoting the rayon industry. Since 1930, it has leaped from an insignificant country to a first-class silk-producing country. Its rayon production is second only to the United States, and it is not as good as the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and France. The total production of Japanese rayon in 1942 was about 130,000 tons (the US rayon production this year is about 300,000 tons), most of which is viscose rayon, with about 48 factories. The most factories are in Osaka with 18, followed by Tokyo with 10, and the rest are scattered in Nagoya, Katata, Fukushima, and other places. The average scale of each factory is about 6 million pounds of silk per year (2,700 tons). Compared with China, there is still no rayon factory! In the spring of 1937, there were three rayon factories initiated in Shanghai, but they were aborted due to the war. The consumption of rayon in China has not been accurately counted so far. According to a survey in 1937, Shanghai alone needs more than 15 tons of rayon per day, and the total daily consumption of rayon in China is about 30 tons, which is 11,000 tons per year. This 11,000 tons of figures already needs one-twelfth of the total production of Japanese rayon in 1942, that is, it needs five rayon factories with an annual output of 6 million pounds to supply consumption. This is only limited to clothing, and the future applications in other industrial uses are not included.

This 11,000 tons of rayon is completely dependent on foreign countries. If calculated at the current market price of 15 million yuan per ton, the total value is 165 billion yuan. This is the amount needed ten years ago, and the increase in the future can be predicted.

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, everything is waiting to be done. If we want to talk about industrial construction, rayon factories are the most important part of industrial construction. It will cost millions of US dollars to build a well-equipped rayon factory! Under the current circumstances, even if the funds are raised, the machinery cannot be manufactured domestically! If you order from the UK and the US, it will not be completed in three or two years. Its slowness will not help the urgent need. American experts from the United Nations Post-War Compensation Committee suggested weakening Japan's industrial production organization to compensate for the losses of the United Nations. Although the report did not explicitly state that the rayon factory is included in the scope of compensation industry, our country has the right to propose to the United Nations Post-War Compensation Committee to compensate our country with several Japanese rayon factories, which is the most convenient method. Assuming that there are 48 Japanese rayon factories, half of them should be listed as compensation industries, which should be 24. The United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and other countries all have the rayon factory industry, but only our country is still lacking! Our government should request the United Nations Post-War Compensation Committee to compensate our country with most of the Japanese rayon factories, and the government will transfer or lease them to private operation in stages to lay the foundation for the rayon industry. On the one hand, it will save the huge amount of leakage over the years, and on the other hand, it will develop the new industrial park, which will make a great contribution to the national economy and people's livelihood, which can be predicted.

**Continuous Rainy Season Talk about Qiantang River**

Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

Report from Hangzhou, Our Newspaper, 3rd

Half a month ago, there was a little rain in the sky over Hangzhou, and a mountain flood broke out upstream of the Qiantang River. Chun'an, Sui'an, Pujiang, Xiaoshan, Zhuji and other counties have already experienced floods, and Dexheng Township in Shaoxing County was almost submerged. In provinces like Zhejiang, floods are even more serious than droughts. If it doesn't rain for a month or two, the rivers, waterways and harbors can be used to adjust water volumes. But when floods come, they are really difficult to deal with, because there's too much water in the rivers, the water in the waterways is about to overflow, and the water in the harbors is already overflowing. The fields cannot hold any more water; seedlings are submerged, and tall crops fall into the water, severely affecting the harvest. Our country, which is supposed to be founded on agriculture, still relies on the traditional saying of "relying on heaven for food". We can only pray to heaven to hope it rains less. Therefore, in almost every county in Jiangnan, there are "Dragon King Temples", because the "Dragon King" can regulate water volumes! It is said that during the eight or nine years of our resistance against Japan, the incense of the "Dragon King" in Jiangnan was still as prosperous as ever, except that the Dragon King, who was originally in the county seat, had been moved to the countryside.

**Summer Rain Separated by Well-Fields**

Since the beginning of summer, the Shanghai-Hangzhou area has been mostly rainy. July in the Gregorian calendar is also June in the traditional Chinese lunar calendar. According to custom, June should be sunny. A folk song circulating among the people says: "June in Jiangnan is sunny, the sister is picking red water chestnuts in the pond, the sharp water chestnut thorns sting the hand, the scorching sun is murderous…" etc. This shows that June in summer is a sunny day. Moreover, June is the time for weeding in the fields. The seedlings have gradually grown, and the weeds between the seedlings need to be scorched to death by the high heat, because they float to the surface after being slowly weeded. There may also be rain during the height of summer, but it is not continuous rain, but rather showers. After the showers, it is a clear blue sky again, and the farmers happily sing folk songs in the fields. Moreover, showers are not necessarily widespread. Sometimes there is rain in one area and not in another, sometimes there is no rain in one area and there is rain in another. Therefore, the old people call it "summer rain separated by well-fields".

**Late Autumn in Midsummer**

July 1st is precisely the third day of the sixth lunar month. It has been raining heavily between Shanghai and Hangzhou. It hasn't stopped on July 4th, which is the sixth day of the sixth lunar month. The rain is getting heavier and heavier, and it seems like there is no hope of stopping. On July 1st, the reporter took an early train to Shanghai. On July 3rd, braving the rain, he took a train from Shanghai to Hangzhou. Looking at the crops on both sides of the railway, they could no longer resist the bullying of the heavy rain. When the train stopped temporarily, I got off the train to ask the old farmers in the small houses next to the railway. The old farmers were frowning at the sky, sucking hard on their dry tobacco pipes. He said: "It is certain that it will rain this month. There was a shower on the third day of the sixth lunar month. We went out to weed the fields in the morning, but it rained in the afternoon, so we had to sleep. But there is still the sixth day of the sixth lunar month. If it seems that it will still rain on the sixth day, then there may be a flood. On the sixth day of the sixth lunar month, we dry clothes, and cats, dogs and livestock need to bathe. If the sixth day of the sixth lunar month is sunny, the harvest will be hopeful! On this day, we also have to worship the Field God and Field Goddess!"

"The sixth day of the sixth lunar month" was not sunny. It was not hot enough for cats and dogs to sweat and roll in the water to bathe. Instead, it was cool like a late autumn day, and the rain was unusually heavy.

**Visiting in the Heavy Rain**

I specially braved the heavy rain to visit the persons in charge of two agricultural affairs agencies in Zhejiang, one was Sun Shoupei, Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, and the other was Mo Dingsen, Director of the Agricultural Improvement Institute. Director Sun told me: "The emergency repair project of the seawall on the north bank of the Qiantang River has not been greatly affected. I am only afraid that the mountain floods in the Jinhua River, Puyang River, and Fuchun River upstream of the Qiantang River will break out again, then tens of thousands of acres of fertile land will be destroyed by the water. We only hope that this heavy rain will not continue, but meteorology tells us that this month will probably still be a rainy season."

**Mountain Floods Upstream**

Director Mo told me: "These few days of rain are not very serious for agricultural affairs now, but if it continues to rain, the fields on both sides of the Qiantang River and the low rice fields will be affected." Because the rainwater has submerged the seedlings, and the seedlings will not grow easily without the cultivation of strong sunlight. In fact, the severity of the rain lies in the autumn, because the autumn is the autumn harvest. The mature rice cannot be harvested in time and will germinate, and if it is harvested but not dried, it will rot." However, the early rice in the eastern Zhejiang area will soon be harvested.

It is said that in the upstream areas of the Qiantang River in eastern Zhejiang, there has been fear of mountain floods in the past few days. A lot of wood, houses, furniture, etc. have been seen rushing down in the Fuchun River. We believe that if the rain continues to fall, the problem is not a simple one.

**"Prepare in Advance"**

It is best if Zhejiang does not have a flood this year, but what if there is a flood? We cannot "rely on heaven for food", we must "man can conquer nature", and to "man can conquer nature", we must "prepare in advance". I think the first priority is for the counties upstream and downstream of the Qiantang River to quickly raise and strengthen the dikes, and at the same time, build drainage ditches to drain the water into the rivers. If the places are a little far from the rivers, we should gather the villagers to dig ponds to drain water. Secondly, we must encourage old farmers to take responsibility for rescuing the fields. They cannot fail to lead the farmers to drain or drain water, and they must stand up and direct the farmers' work. Thirdly, those counties that have been affected by mountain floods should have the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration quickly send staff to investigate the disaster situation and provide relief, because this is of course also the result of the enemy's occupation for seven or eight years. Fourth, when necessary, each county should mobilize urban youth to go to the fields to rescue the floods. When manpower was difficult in the rear, we mobilized to help farmers harvest rice and achieved very good results. Now, if the flood is serious, if the people in the city do not try to rescue, then what do the people in the city want to eat if the fields are not harvested? Of course, the above is only an emergency measure. The fundamental solution is to mechanize agriculture and plant a large number of trees. If our agriculture still relies on the farmers relying on thousands of years of traditional experience and relying on their two hands and feet to make it for everyone to eat, then this is very dangerous for the future of the country. Because the times are advancing rapidly, and the lives of the vast majority of our farmers are still stuck in thousands of years ago. Zhejiang is known as a land of cultural relics, and it is still the same.

**The Water of West Lake**

Writing to this point, I would like to end this newsletter with one thing. Hangzhou City is the capital of Zhejiang Province, which can be said to be the capital of the province. Hangzhou itself does not have much production. It owns the famous West Lake, which can only be seen but not eaten, but the water of Hangzhou West Lake is said to irrigate the fertile land of Haiyan every year, because outside the seawall of Haiyan is the sea, and the water is salty, so it cannot be used for farming. Therefore, the field grains of Hangzhou City were completed by Haiyan many years ago. If there is too much water in Haiyan, it will be poured back into West Lake. Now the water of West Lake is only a foot away from the shore. If there is too much water in Haiyan now and the water of West Lake is full again, and the people of Hangzhou City do not pay attention to the possible flood in Zhejiang, and do not try to remedy it, then when the water of this beautiful West Lake overflows, I am afraid that Hangzhou City will also become a flooded country, right? I hope that the above is just worrying!

**Impressions of Foreign Soldiers**

Judging from the uniforms of foreign soldiers in Tokyo, they can be divided into American, British, Australian, Soviet, French, and Dutch. These national soldiers are all under the unified command of MacArthur Headquarters, but they are stationed in their respective camps, wearing their own national costumes, and speaking their own languages. They show their respective national characteristics in their interactions with the Japanese. The American army has the largest number, more than 150,000. They are all dispatched: relaxed, lively, cheerful, and full of energy all day long. They are active everywhere, greeting people randomly, and always have a smiling face that means all brothers within the four seas. Moreover, there are also American blacks, Japanese, Chinese, and Filipinos, all with two golden letters "US" attached to their collars, running around everywhere with the same style as Americans. They can make Japanese female elevator operators laugh, because these

Water and Fire
 少夫

In the past, the common saying to describe the misdeeds of those in power was that the people were in the depths of water and fire. Now, unexpectedly, these abstract and grand descriptions have found real-world proof.

Please see a telegram from Zhenjiang in this newspaper the day before yesterday: the Communist army in northern Jiangsu is actively creating famine and disaster in the region. It is reported that several breaches have been made in the stone dikes of Hongze Lake, and the west bank of the canal around Huai'an has been completely flooded, affecting an area of over 300 li. People and livestock are drifting, a truly tragic sight. The people in this area are all crying out to the heavens, gasping for breath in the water.

The eyes of the people are sharp, and their senses are naturally not slow. The Communist army, which is used to using the people as a signboard, is now leaving the people of over 300 li around Hongze Lake gasping for breath in the water. One wonders if the people in this 300 li area are even considered people?

There are now some individuals who are constantly looking for opportunities to exert themselves to the fullest. I wonder if this Communist army's "virtuous policy" of breaching the dikes will also be used as propaganda material? Or is it a warning for the future, to put the people in fire?

However, it is always a portion of our compatriots who suffer. I hope everyone will stop being mere bystanders and extend a helping hand to those who can!

On Junkong Road
 珊詩

Looking at the Shanghai map, Junkong Road is the longest road in the easternmost part of Shanghai. Its reputation is not very high, and it is not as bustling as the roads on the way to Longhua. However, it is the largest passage from Yangshupu to Jiangwan. As the name suggests, one can imagine the great responsibility it bore during the war.

Bullet Marks and Wounds

Indeed, walking on Junkong Road gives you a different feeling. Here, there are bunkers left over from the war, covered with bullet marks. It is said that during the defense of Shanghai, there was also a fierce battle here. The earth-shattering deeds of that day are now left to be lonely and silent, allowing a few passersby to deeply mourn. It was born under gunfire in the past, now let it die quietly! Occasionally, a few people stop here to rest, but it is only to give people a warning! Recently, the Independent 3rd Battalion of the Military Police, which will be stationed in Japan, is temporarily stationed here. Also, Major Chiang Wei-kuo, who fought in the India-Burma theater, leads a part of the mechanized unit of the Chinese Armored Forces and resides here. Therefore, Junkong Road has added a bit of liveliness. In addition to workers and students, there is now a group of young people who bravely resisted Japan that year to decorate Junkong Road.

Besides these, there is also a strong contrast here. Medieval castle-style houses and the latest semi-circular activity metal houses can be found on Junkong Road. Thatched huts and Spanish-style houses also divide Junkong Road into two scenes. By the clear stream, in the green grass, children can be found playing everywhere, baring their chests and arms. Although their faces are dark, it cannot hide their malnutrition, and they look pale. Look, there are children of school age leading cattle, and children of developmental age helping adults with farm work.

Indeed, Junkong Road is too strange. There are small wheelbarrows pushing on the coal cinder ground, and there are also large ten-wheeled trucks driving by, leaving deep marks on it. And above your head, huge airplanes often circle, these are airplanes preparing to land at Jiangwan Dachang Airport. Walking on the long Junkong Road, looking up at the silver eagles flying by, everyone has felt that Junkong Road still retains a part of the ancient Chinese color. But it also incorporates products after scientific development. Obviously, it is somewhat discordant.

Vestiges of Aggression

Traces of the Japanese invasion can still be found here. Japanese-style low bungalows, and the small wooden bridge over the small river, with the three white characters "Showa Bridge" on it (now scratched off with a knife), were all built by the Japanese army during the occupation. But the Japanese's dream of aggression in the past has been completely shattered today. Occasionally, a few Japanese soldiers who have not yet been repatriated pass by. In this beautiful natural scenery, they should also recognize and realize the peace and happiness.

Recently, because Junkong Road has gradually prospered, the Bureau of Public Works has started construction projects there. Soon, Junkong Road will surely have a new look.

### Signboard
 羅汀

In common language, one can often hear the words "signboard". Such as "Relying on whose signboard?" "Signboard is strong"... etc. But where did these two words [signboard] come from?

The Baojia system implemented in the Qing Dynasty involved giving each household a doorplate, stating the head of the household's name and the number of people in the household, which was changed once a year. Its organization consisted of ten households as a "pai," with a "pai-tou" (head of the pai), ten "pai" as a "jia," with a "jia-zhang" (head of the jia), and ten "jia" as a "bao," with a "bao-zheng" (head of the bao). Their duties included urging the payment of rent and grain, and handling corvée labor. The most important thing was to prevent the Han people from rebelling. Therefore, although the position of "pai-tou" was small, its power was unexpectedly great, just like the "Baojia-zhang" during the enemy and puppet period, who could abuse their authority and do whatever they wanted. In the countryside, farmers and village women naturally showed extra caution.

Therefore, "pai-tou" became a common term.

The Words of a Movie Theater Ticket Seller
 愚魯

Needless to say, the general audience's impression of the movie theater ticket seller is just sitting by the fan, slowly counting banknotes, and slowly tearing off admission tickets, perhaps very leisurely compared to the audience who are squeezed in and sweating. The truth is we have our own reasons for being slow: one person after another comes to buy tickets, the first one takes out a large bill and asks you to make change, the second one uses Customs Gold Units to pay, and the third one who comes to buy tickets is a Russian, rummages in his pocket for US dollars and asks you to convert them. We are not Einstein, we also have to pause when counting, afraid that once we make a mistake and give too little change, the customer will go to the manager's office to complain, saying that you are intentionally skimming, and it will be recorded as a demerit; if you give too much change, the salary is limited, and we cannot afford to pay for it; furthermore, if you don't take a closer look at the banknotes, there is a risk of counterfeit banknotes getting mixed in.

Let me tell you more about our grievances, although the movie theater works on the principle of half-day work, don't underestimate this half-day, from after lunch until after 10 pm, which exceeds the eight-hour system. When we encounter holidays, we also have to do an early show. All day long we stay in the narrow and stuffy ticket booth, waiting for the audience to buy tickets for the current show or the next show, until we sell tickets for the day after tomorrow. Except for the two routine "private" matters of eating and going to the toilet, we are nailed to the hard bench in the ticket booth. This set of sitting skills is really not easy to practice. No joke, the first few days when I became a ticket seller, my buttocks were chafed raw.

You say that ticket sellers can skim money, I don't deny it absolutely. Ticket sellers are also mortals, and for those customers who throw banknotes down and take the tickets and leave, we won't act like righteous gentlemen and chase after them to return the overpayment. Usually, we put the overpaid money aside and let the audience discover the shortage and come back to claim it. If they don't come until the closing and end of the show, that is our luck, and we will accept it without hesitation. As for intentionally giving too little change, apart from a very few who are extremely bored and bold, most of us don't dare to risk our jobs.

One of the most painful things for us is that there is not a single holiday in 365 days - it is rare that this "July 7th" [anniversary of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident], we also have a day off for the first time ever. - The day when others are most carefree is the day when we are most busy and distressed. Because on this day, it is even more intensified. In order to make money for the boss and increase tax revenue for the government, we have to sell tickets for four or five shows in one day. We really yearn for the thorough vacation system in the UK - all entertainment venues also stop performing on holidays. In this way, we a group of movie theater employees can also have a day off.

You ask about our salary? Depending on the price increase, the salary of our first-class movie theater ticket sellers generally hovers around 200,000, compared to those who have spent more than ten years of effort, time and money in the process of schooling, and as a result become civil servants with a monthly salary of 100,000, we naturally have nothing to say - although we sometimes have the hardship of being stretched thin.

Recently, the implementation of reserved seating is also an added hassle for us: this nearsighted audience member complains that it is too far back and asks to exchange for a ticket with a seat in front, and that sharp-eyed youth complains that the seat is too far in front and is uncomfortable to watch, insisting on moving to the back. As a result, ticket exchanges are endless, disputes arise from time to time, and the speed of ticket sales is greatly reduced.

Pitiful Mailbox
 蔡麟

It has been almost a month. The mailbox at the intersection of Shaanxi South Road and Julu Road in this city, perhaps because it is too close to the road, was actually run over by the "city tiger" [automobile]. Since the matter is over, I must speak up. My mailing letters has become inconvenient, so I will write a word or two.

The appearance of that postbox was like a big fat man, very healthy, unexpectedly so fragile that it could not withstand the insurance bar on the front of the car. Unable to avoid it, it bore the brunt and was cut in half and lay on the sidewalk. At this time, it looks like a pregnant woman who has suffered a violent death. It was still pregnant with contents——newsletters and letters, still in the abdomen, those senders, they never imagined that it had been swallowed by the "city tiger"啊！

It lay horizontally on the sidewalk of Shaanxi South Road for several days. The street sweeper, when passing by, really lacked the strength and could only look at it helplessly. I don't know when or who cleaned up the mess and moved it away, presumably buried it, so from now on there is one less mailbox here, but there are still two or three inches of remnants.

I also thought that with the large number of cars coming in continuously, the mailboxes in this city should all feel a sense of impending doom. Assuming that one or two are knocked down every three days, then Shanghai will eliminate all the mailboxes in the city in a few issue. Therefore, maybe we should start a [Save the Mailbox] movement.

Seal Script Knowledge
 高甜心

Seals mainly use seal script, so engraving seals must first understand seal script. To know the evolution of seal script throughout history, to understand the origin of ancient people's writing and the meaning of the Six Scripts is to achieve the goal. Seal script can be divided into seven types:

1.  Ancient Script: Ancient script was created by Cangjie. Cangjie, the historian of the Yellow Emperor, saw the footprints of birds and beasts and knew that the principles could be distinguished and differentiated, and first created writing. All crafts relied on it, and all goods were examined by it. It is the original writing of China.

2.  Zhou Script (also known as Great Seal Script, also known as Bronze Script, also known as Inscription Script): Zhou Script was created by Zhou Dynasty historian Zhou. Because the ancient script was simple in form and inconvenient to use, Zhou added to it. The Zhong, Ding, Yi utensils, and Stone Drum Inscriptions of the Zhou Dynasty are of this type, with many compound characters.

3.  Qin Seal Script (also known as Small Seal Script, also known as Jade Tendril Script): Because the writing of the late Zhou Dynasty was already messy, in the Warring States period, laws and decrees were different, clothing and caps were different, languages were different, and writing was different. Qin therefore sorted and unified it, removed its complexity, and returned to simplicity. Qin Shihuang burned books and buried scholars, becoming a sinner for eternity, but his merit of unifying writing cannot be erased.

4.  Curvy Seal Script: Curvy Seal Script was used exclusively for imitating seals in the Han Dynasty. It is winding, dignified, and generous, but some of it does not conform to the Six Scripts.

5.  Lance Script: Used on ancient weapons.

6.  Bird and Insect Script: Used for flag identification and symbol letters, and its writing can also be included in seals.

7.  Nine-Fold Script: Nine-Fold Script originated in the Tang Dynasty and is also called Upper Great Seal Script. Spiraling and folding, it is even more incompatible with the Six Scripts and should not be included in seals.

On the fifth day, Doctor Yu asked Doctor Cao Bowen to come and test your blood, in preparation for blood transfusion. It was found that your blood type was O, and the number of white blood cells suddenly increased, clearly indicating that there was inflammation somewhere. That evening, you suddenly started shivering and hiccupping, and your feet were also a little swollen. This did not seem like a good sign; but Doctor Yu did not refuse me, and I was still very optimistic, and tried my best to encourage you, saying, "You must believe in the power of heaven, heaven can protect you; you must release courage to resist that hateful disease!" You struggled to answer me, "I believe in the power of heaven, and I am very courageous! I know that there is nothing seriously wrong with me, but I just don't have an appetite and I don't have any energy." I said, "Yes, as long as you are willing to rest well and not worry too much, your illness will surely get better." You said, "If my illness really gets better, then you will be better off, and the children will be better off; if it doesn't get better, then I am a woman, and it is nothing rare, you can marry another one." I immediately stopped you, "What? You're going to say these unlucky words again! I don't allow you to say it!" Then you smiled slightly and said nothing.

On the sixth day, the hiccup stopped; your younger brother Hongxin and cousin Xiangquan came from Shanghai to see you together, and bought Floridian tangerines and apples for you to eat, but you just wanted to sleep this day, and didn't say much to them. Although I tried to tease you in various ways, you were still melancholy. In the evening, they had to return to Shanghai because of their work. When Doctor Yu came, in addition to giving you a heart tonic and Vitamin BC, he also added 10 cc of glucose; I asked him if it was possible to transfuse blood that day, he frowned and replied, "It's not the time yet!" I was a little disappointed, and my heart unconsciously became heavy again.

April 23rd, this was the seventh day of your recovery from a critical condition, and you were clamoring to defecate early in the morning. Although I had bought you a flat commode for use in the sickbed, you still struggled to sit up, called Mama Ye to help you sit on the commode, and the amount you relieved was a lot, this was the first time in seven days; and you also vomited a lot of thick phlegm; in my simple mind, optimism was added again. I thought this was a good sign.

In the first half of the day, you kept clamoring to defecate, so you relieved some again the next day; but two times of getting up and sitting down had exhausted your strength. In the afternoon, the weather suddenly became very hot. In our temporary wooden shed bedroom, the mercury in the thermometer rose to 88 degrees. I opened all the windows and doors, but it still felt hot. I saw that you were sweating on your forehead and your breathing was a little rapid; although you were only covered with a bed sheet, you were still sweating profusely. I anxiously asked you how you felt, and you replied weakly that you had a bit of a stomachache. At about four o'clock, Doctor Yu came, put the thermometer in your mouth, your mind was a little blurred, and your teeth could not grasp it, so he quickly took it out and inserted it under your armpit. After a while, when he looked at the thermometer... God, it exceeded the usual temperature by three degrees, breaking your highest record! Doctor Yu frowned, and my heart was instantly knotted. Doctor Yu immediately took your pulse, listened to your heart, injected those three kinds of injections, and added fifteen CC of glucose, and added two penicillin tablets to the prescription, which Zheng'er rushed to Guanqian to get back. Doctor Yu did not refuse me, and I was still not despairing, because the room was too hot, I quickly found the electric fan that had been sealed for nine years. I turned on the electricity in the evening to drive away the heat, so that you could be cool. My heart was temporarily settled; thinking of before the "Li Bao" resumed publication, my old friend Jiang Jianhou had sent a quick letter asking for manuscripts, so I went to the study to write a reply, and wrote out the two poems that Hu had composed the day before, who knew that I had just finished writing and put down the pen, when I suddenly heard Bao Mei crying out; I hurried across the garden and rushed back to the room, but saw that you had passed out, again like the night of the sixteenth, "Ooh... ooh... ooh..." moaning! I was greatly surprised, and immediately panicked, on the one hand, I busy called Shijing to call Doctor Yu, on the other hand, Zheng'er and Ling'er helped you up, pinching your philtrum, pulling your hair, shouting in unison, wanting you to wake up. After a while, Shijing reported back that Doctor Yu was out on a visit and had not returned; I sighed deeply, knowing that I had fallen into a desperate situation; and you finally could not resist the threat of death, your pulse gradually weakened, your hands and feet gradually cooled, and in less than fifteen minutes, you spat out your last breath, it was over! Everything was over! At this moment, my heart was broken and my soul flew away, like a fool and a drunk; I cried, shouted, cursed, cursed the cruelty of heaven's heart, cursed everything in the heavens and on earth! In my ears, I could only hear a burst of wailing, Zheng'er, Ling'er, Lian'er, Xi nephew, Bao Mei, and Mama Ye were all crying and turned into tears; even Shijing, who had never shed tears, shed tears. This small room was filled with the most tragic atmosphere in the world.

### Lake Area Bandit Suppression Funds Insufficient; Wealthy Individuals Personally Raise Ten Million Yuan

[Our Newspaper Wuxing Correspondence] Since the victory in Zhejiang, scattered soldiers and bandits have not yet been completely eliminated. Currently, the Provincial Security Headquarters has ordered districts and counties to thoroughly suppress them within a set period and implement rural cleansing. The Wuxing County Rural Cleansing Committee has been established and has begun its work, already solving several cases. The County Assembly believes that this bandit suppression is of utmost importance to local security. Although the provincial government has allocated 30 million yuan for bandit suppression expenses, only 1 million yuan can be allocated to the Lake Area Commissioner's Office. There are no provisions for intelligence expenses, casualties, medical assistance, county rewards, and the concentration and repatriation of scattered soldiers and guerrillas, all of which must be spent within the county for rural cleansing. To ensure the effectiveness and smooth completion of this suppression, a proposal was passed during the County Assembly's first general meeting to mobilize shareholders, merchants, and wealthy households to donate 10 million yuan specifically for the above-mentioned expenses within the county. It is reported that donations are being received enthusiastically, with everyone hoping for the successful completion of this suppression.

Hangzhou: All Enemy and Puppet Assets to Be Auctioned Off

Enemy and puppet assets in Hangzhou have been completely taken over, including factories, materials, real estate, etc., with a total value of 7 billion yuan. Currently, the materials portion has been sold through eight auctions and five public sales, generating approximately 1.5 billion yuan. The real estate portion is currently being managed by the original residents. Experts have been dispatched by the Central Trust Bureau to Hangzhou to handle procedures such as taking photographs and drawing maps, so that prices can be estimated and auctions or public sales can be carried out. As for the factories, since they were previously taken over by personnel dispatched by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry will be requested to continue being responsible for price estimation and separate sales. All proceeds will be remitted to the national treasury in full.

Taicang: Sea Dike Endangered, Urgent Repairs Needed

Due to continuous heavy rain and rapidly rising seawater levels, the sea dikes near Liuhekou North and Qiyakou North in Taicang County have been neglected for years. This summer, water levels have risen to unprecedented heights, and five breaches have been discovered, creating an extremely dangerous situation. Emergency repairs have been carried out by disaster relief workers, but the typhoon that struck on the 29th and 30th of last month, with high night tides, washed away half of the newly repaired earthwork. Many of the stones thrown on the outer slope were also swept away, making the situation even more critical. The county's Good Samaritan Association has sent an urgent telegram to higher authorities, requesting immediate repairs to ensure safety.

Wuxi: Military Law Adjudicator Accused of Being a Traitor

The headquarters has already sent a letter to the Jiangsu High Court for review and investigation and has instructed Chief Ma of the local county court to investigate and handle the matter. It is reported that Zhang was previously detained by the court for questioning on suspicion of accepting bribes.

Wujiang: Farmland Flooded; Telegram Requesting Relief

The water level of Tai Lake is higher this year. Since the beginning of summer, there have been continuous thunderstorms, and the bridges along the Sujia Road are submerged, and the ditches are silted, which causes the drainage efficiency to be entirely lost. More than 400,000 mu of low-lying farmland near the lake and in various districts have been flooded by water. This accounts for 3/10 of the county's total farmland area. The nearly ripe early rice has suddenly turned into a vast expanse of water, and the farmers' previous efforts have been wasted. The disaster situation is dire. In addition to dispatching personnel to supervise the repair of embankments and find ways to drain water, the county government, in conjunction with the Relief Association, sent a telegram to the Su-Ning Branch Office requesting approval for relief and a loan of 30 water pumps, as well as funding for emergency assistance.

The Anhui Provincial Government has appointed Zhang Shouye, the fourth younger brother of the famous novelist Zhang Henshui, to take over. Zhang previously served as an inspector for the 6th District Commissioner's Office. He is well-versed in the local culture and geography of the county. It is reported that Zhang is already on his way from the provincial government.

### Editorial: An Analysis of the German Economic Problem

The twenty-one-nation peace conference on handling post-war problems in Europe is scheduled to open in Paris on the 29th of this month. The four-nation foreign ministers' conference in Paris, which began on June 15th and ended on the 12th of this month, finally managed to agree on the draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, as well as the date for the peace conference. Although there were heated debates and twists and turns during the period, the fact that this result was finally achieved cannot be denied as progress compared to previous meetings.

However, the four-nation foreign ministers' conference has yet to reach an agreement on the German and Austrian issues. The German problem can be considered the focal point of Europe's future peace. Therefore, unless the German problem is handled appropriately and fairly, there will be no real guarantee of peace in Europe or even the world.

Regarding the German problem, the most pressing issue is the economy. Germany has been divided into four occupation zones, with Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union each having different management policies, especially in the economic field, without a unified institution or plan. This is, of course, a major obstacle to promoting Germany's economic self-reliance. In 1870, when Germany was not unified, the country was divided into many small states, each with its own customs duties, which hindered the smooth flow of German goods. Later, they voluntarily organized a customs union, which laid the foundation for Germany's economic prosperity. The current situation in Germany, divided by the occupying forces, is similar to that of the early 19th century. If the German economy cannot be self-reliant and the people's lives cannot be stabilized, it is feared that not only will they be unable to fulfill their obligations to pay reparations, but they will also constantly require assistance from various countries, which is certainly not an appropriate solution. Moreover, the long-term inability of the German economy to be self-reliant may not be a blessing for the future of European peace. Therefore, US Secretary of State Byrnes strongly criticized the economic barriers dividing Germany and advocated the establishment of a central economic institution throughout Germany. General McNarney, the US military commander in Germany, also requested the four foreign ministers to unify the economic system in Germany. British Foreign Secretary Bevin agreed with the US proposal and also suggested reducing the economic barriers in the various German occupation zones and establishing a unified national economy. However, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, while advocating that Germany should have a central government, firmly opposed the unification of the economic system.

Molotov's main reasons for opposing it are nothing more than the following three points: First, if Germany has a central economic institution, with the German people's organizational capabilities, industrial technology, and foundation, the German economy will quickly become self-reliant and prosperous, which may become a threat to future world peace. After World War I, Germany's economic situation was very difficult, with inflation and unemployment increasing, but because of the support of the United Nations and the fact that German economic unity was not destroyed, they were able to overcome all difficulties and develop from economic development to military expansion. The British and American proposals may fall into the same mistake as last time. Molotov also suspected that Britain and the United States had a secret understanding with Germany, so they were trying to support Germany to deal with the Soviet Union, just like after World War I, Britain, fearing that France would become too powerful, helped Germany everywhere to deal with France. Molotov's suspicion is not necessarily a fact, but his concerns cannot be said to be completely unfounded. If Germany's economy becomes completely self-reliant at an early date, it will certainly be a force to be reckoned with.

Second, the Soviet Union has taken away important German machinery in its occupation zone. Moreover, its occupation zone is not the most industrialized area of Germany; the most industrialized area is still in the British occupation zone. Eastern Germany, where agriculture is most important, is easily self-sufficient and does not need a unified economic institution throughout Germany. The Soviet Union's most ideal solution, of course, would be to let the Germans farm and have Soviet industrial products directly imported, monopolizing their market. If the whole country were unified, then industrial products from the British occupation zone could be transported to the east, and agricultural products from the east could alleviate the current food shortages in the British occupation zone. British Foreign Secretary Bevin, at the foreign ministers' conference, because Molotov opposed it, declared that Britain did not intend to continue borrowing money to maintain relief efforts in the British zone, and that industry in the British zone must be restored to production so that the entire zone would no longer be completely dependent on Britain. From this statement, we can understand that the economic problems of Germany, because of the different circumstances in the two regions, the steps cannot be the same.

Third, regarding the disposition of Germany, as a whole, the Soviet Union wants Germany to be divided, but deliberately says that the establishment of a central government should be decided by a plebiscite. Britain and the United States want Germany to be united and suggest that Germany organize a federal government. Since World War II, the Soviet Union's influence has gradually expanded from Eastern Europe to Central Europe. The Soviet government is clearly implementing its westward policy. It does not want to dominate all of Germany now, which is practically impossible for the time being. But she is eager to thoroughly reform the economy and politics and absolutely control the military power in all the places she occupies. After this place is firmly occupied and digested, she will plan for the second step of development. In the German occupation zone, the Soviet Union has 600,000 troops stationed, the property of large landlords has long been evenly distributed, a new party jointly organized by the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party has been supported, and the elements of other parties have been severely eliminated. These tasks have been carried out with considerable success.

On the British and American side, they want Germany to be economically self-reliant to reduce the burden on their own countries. In the political arena, Britain and the United States are also willing to support and train them into true Anglo-American-style democracy. As long as Nazism is eradicated, they are willing to hand over all political power to the Germans. As for the military, they are unwilling to station troops for a long time. Even the current troop presence is much smaller than that of the Soviet Union. In order to implement this policy, their methods are naturally different from those of the Soviet Union. They do not want Germany to be divided; they want Germany to be united, and there is one major benefit to unification. Britain and the United States do not necessarily have any understanding with Germany, but the Soviet Union's westward policy, in the eyes of the British and Americans, is not a peaceful threat. The most ideal way for Britain and the United States, naturally, is to support Germany to a certain extent, so that it can serve as a buffer zone between the Soviet Union and Western Europe, and at the same time have the confidence that Germany can truly be democratic and no longer have aggressive thoughts.

According to the facts analyzed by Wang Wen, there will obviously be fierce conflicts between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States on the economic problems of Germany, but there may be ways to mediate between them. Therefore, we hope that when the four foreign ministers' conference is held again in November and discusses the German issue, the representatives of all countries should eliminate their opinions and seek a thorough solution to this issue in order to guide the world onto the path of true peace.

### Far East Express Passenger Ship; US Tendering for Construction

Unmatched Speed and Equipment

[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] The Maritime Commission is today tendering for the construction of two express luxury passenger ships for the Far East route. Once completed, they can travel from the West Coast to Japan in eight days. Each ship can carry 1,238 passengers, weighs 12,500 tons, is 920 feet long, has a unique structure, and has a speed of 30 nautical miles per hour. It is scheduled to be completed in March 1949 and will be the largest and fastest passenger ship in the United States. The Maritime Commission calls it a "modern streamline ship." The upper part of the ship will be made almost entirely of aluminum, with each ship using approximately 770 tons of aluminum. The ship has a theater with 304 seats. There are three classes of cabins, each with a swimming pool, as well as a circular shopping arcade with clothing stores, beauty salons, barber shops, and photo studios. There are 475 first-class cabins, 207 second-class cabins, and 696 third-class cabins. First and second class cabins all have private bathrooms.

### US Industrial Products Will Limit Exports

[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th, United Press] US Civilian Production Administrator Small will sign an order immediately that will only permit exports of most industrial products that can promote overall production. The Civilian Production Bureau has listed clothing, textiles, building materials, railway and farm equipment, and various durable consumer goods, such as cellophane paper. It is expected that once the Civilian Goods Supply Agency decides on the price control bill that has been finally passed by Congress and President Truman signs it, Small will issue the order immediately. The prices of many commodities in the international market will be higher than in the United States, and prices can be set freely. Since June, the Price Administration has also canceled the maximum price limit for export goods. Therefore, unless domestic prices in the United States catch up to avoid a large number of products being exported, many American merchants may be tempted by foreign markets. According to the proposed order of the Civilian Production Management Office, the monthly exports of raw materials in the future cannot account for a very large proportion of the average monthly exports in the first half of the year.

### Discussing Ways to Suppress Price Inflation

It is believed that Truman may veto the measure passed by the Senate. At the same time, demonstrations protesting soaring prices are continuing. The price limits of the Price Control Bureau in most parts of the United States will be suppressed based on the higher new prices determined after the expiration of price controls two weeks ago.
