### Marshall, Zhang Qun, and Zhou Enlai to Hold First Meeting Today to Formulate Concrete Measures to Stop Conflict and Restore Transportation; Negotiating Representatives to Discuss Agenda Simultaneously

[This Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, midnight on the 6th, broadcast: The negotiations between the National Government and the Communist Party have made significant progress. Two concrete meetings will be held in Chongqing on the 7th. (1) The Marshall-Zhang Qun-Zhou Enlai Three-Person Committee will hold its first meeting, chaired by Marshall, to formulate concrete measures to stop conflict and restore transportation. (2) The 38 representatives of the Consultative Conference will hold their first informal meeting to discuss the agenda and voting methods for the first general assembly opening on January 10th.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] US Information Service report: Special Envoy Marshall visited Chairman Chiang at 11:30 AM on the 5th and had lunch with him.

[United Press, Chongqing, 6th] Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai declared: The ceasefire order agreed upon by the Kuomintang and Communist representatives yesterday will be issued three days before the opening of the Political Consultative Conference. According to Democratic League spokesman Luo Longji, the draft of the ceasefire order is being considered by both sides and will be submitted to General Marshall. This order does not apply to the Nine Eastern Provinces because the Nine Eastern Provinces are not areas of conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The omission of the Nine Eastern Provinces from this draft implies that the Communist Party has recognized the National Army's takeover of the Northeast or is part of an exchange of conditions between the two sides, but it has not been announced.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 6th] Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai expressed optimism after his first meeting with government representative Zhang Qun, Chairman of Sichuan Province. He said that the Central Government has fully agreed to the Communist Party's plan to restore all transportation (including railways, postal services, telecommunications, and aviation). It is believed that the Political Consultative Conference will be able to increase pressure to enable both sides of the dispute to reach practical agreements. The date for the actual cessation of conflict has not yet been determined. The Communist Party stated that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will soon issue a joint communique. Well-informed sources point out that even if the conflict can be stopped immediately, it will not necessarily guarantee the final resolution of the fundamental problems. However, people from all walks of life today believe that the negotiations will reach their highest stage. Special Envoy Marshall is still studying the various aspects of the internal situation in China and is obviously taking a cautious attitude towards the progress of the negotiations. It was previously reported that Special Envoy Marshall would go to Yan'an, but according to members of Special Envoy Marshall's staff, this will not happen until the unity negotiations have reached an agreement or have completely broken down. In addition, Wu Tiecheng hosted a banquet on Sunday to entertain all the representatives of the National Political Council. The Communist Party is scheduled to hold a cocktail party on Monday afternoon to entertain people from all walks of life and has sent out 400 invitations. General Marshall is also among those invited.

The Inner Mongolia Goodwill Mission Will Depart in Groups

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 6th] Inner Mongolia, which will become China's official northern border in the future, is currently in turmoil under complex factors. The Inner Mongolia Goodwill Mission led by Bai Yunti is currently waiting here to take off. They will be divided into several groups and depart separately for the Northeast and Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan. It is not yet certain which group Bai Yunti himself will join. De Wang is also spending the winter in Beiping, and he has a rather negative influence on Inner Mongolia. News of new turmoil in Inner Mongolia comes from the Xing'an area of ​​the Northeast, where there is already a "People's Committee." It currently has 20,000 troops reorganized from puppet troops and is still continuing to recruit soldiers. The chairman of this "People's Committee" is Bao Baochen, and the secretary-general is Ma Mingzhou. Another important figure is Tong Xiweng, leader of the Inner Mongolia People's Revolutionary Party. According to recent news, the Chahar-Suiyuan Communist Army has also become passive recently, transporting large quantities of goods from Zhangjiakou westward every day. Conversely, the official authorities here are increasingly optimistic about the situation in Chahar-Suiyuan.

[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] The US State Department stated today: The United States will accept any resolution reached by the Chinese and Soviet governments regarding the status of Outer Mongolia. Chongqing officially announced that China recognizes the independence of Outer Mongolia based on the Sino-Soviet Treaty. This was decided after repeated consultations between Marshal Stalin, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, and Chiang Ching-kuo in Moscow.

### Guangdong Tax Revenue Increases Daily; Coastal Salt Farms Recover

[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 6th] After recovery and adjustment, the Guangdong Customs' tax revenue has been increasing sharply, now reaching 10 million yuan per day. More than 60 million yuan has been collected in the two months since the recovery. After the resumption of remittances to Southeast Asia, the amount of remittances from overseas Chinese reaches about 300 to 400 million yuan per month, which has a great impact on the livelihoods and economy of various places. At the same time, as transportation between Shanghai and Guangdong has gradually become more frequent, remittances between the two places have also been increasing daily, especially telegraphic transfers. The remittance fee has been reduced from 12% to 8%. The general market situation is more active than before, but due to the scarcity of materials, prices are still continuing to rise, and credit is also tighter than before. Several coastal salt farms in Guangdong Province have been completely destroyed due to the war. The salt authorities have decided to provide loans for relief so that they can continue production. After the harvest, the loans will be repaid with goods. Currently, salt farms in various places have been restored one after another. According to the authorities, the current salt production in coastal salt farms is very abundant. In addition to meeting the domestic food needs, one-third of the surplus can be transported abroad.

### General Sun Lianzhong Speaks

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] General Sun Lianzhong granted this newspaper's reporter an exclusive interview today. According to him: (1) Hebei Province will still be established in Baoding. The provincial government is currently in Beiping as a matter of expediency. (2) Within the Hebei portion of the war zone, only 20,000 Japanese soldiers in Shijiazhuang and Cangxian have not yet surrendered; as for those who have surrendered and returned to their country, it is estimated that there are more than 29,000 people.

He is currently in consultation with representatives of the US Psychological Warfare Department on this matter. (3) The election of representatives to the National Assembly and the Provincial Assembly in Hebei Province is being prepared. According to the reporter's investigation, the original quota for representatives to the National Assembly in Hebei Province was 50, but it has now been changed to 60% for regional representatives and 40% for professional representatives, according to the previous plan of 43 regional representatives and 7 professional representatives.

### Headquarters of the Eleventh War Zone Moves to Zhengzhou, Under the Charge of Liu Zhi

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 6th] The Eleventh War Zone, which originally governed northern Henan, has moved its command headquarters to Zhengzhou, under the charge of Liu Zhi, director of the Pacification Headquarters. Song Kenfan, the chief of staff who was not captured with Gao Ma last time, flew to Beiping from Xinxiang on the 5th.

### Wei Daoming Returns Home to Report on His Work; Dong Xian'guang Will Accompany Him Back to Chongqing

[Central News Agency, Washington, 5th Dispatch] Our Ambassador to the United States, Wei Daoming, told a Central News Agency reporter that he is preparing to leave Washington on January 7th to return to Chongqing and is expected to arrive in Chongqing around the 15th. He met with US Secretary of State Byrnes today and will go to the White House to consult with President Truman before taking a car to the West Coast on the 7th. He will take off from San Francisco on January 10th, first to Shanghai, and then return to Chongqing.

[United Press, Washington, 5th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wei Daoming, who is about to return home to report on his work, met with Secretary of State Byrnes today, but Wei and the State Department did not comment on what was discussed. According to unconfirmed reports, Wei inquired with Byrnes about the extent to which the recent Moscow Tripartite Foreign Ministers Conference discussed the situation in China and wanted to know the latest US attitude towards the situation in China and what it hoped the National Government would do in the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations.

### President Song Flies to Shanghai Today After Completing Inspections of Tianjin and Qingdao

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 6th] The industry of Pingjin (Beiping and Tianjin) will be reborn in the New Year. After President Song's iron-fisted clean-up of the Pingjin area, 163 factories have been re-received by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Regarding the issue of resuming work, President Song adopted the approach of immediately resolving each case individually and never getting them mixed up in a muddy mess. Because most of the factories are in Tianjin, he brought all relevant departments to Tianjin to solve the problems together. The Supervisory Committee of the Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau in the Pingjin area, which is divided into mining, smelting, machinery, electrical engineering, papermaking, pharmaceutical, textile, acid-base, and other groups, will also set off in groups recently to uncover the seals of each factory and conduct practical inspections of the resumption of work.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 6th] President Song and his entourage left Tianjin by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) special plane at 9:40 AM on the 6th and flew to Qingdao, where they were scheduled to stay for one day and fly to Shanghai on the 7th to return to Chongqing.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 6th] President Song of the Executive Yuan, accompanied by Councillors Xu Shizan, Secretaries Jiang Xiuping, Yi Zhongqiu, Zhou Yuemei, Engineer Guan Songsheng, Dalian Mayor Shen Yi, and many attendants, arrived in Qingdao at 11:25 AM today by CNAC special plane from Tianjin at 9:30 AM. They stayed at the Yingbing Hotel and immediately began to work. They also summoned Cheng Yiling, Deputy Director of the National Business Receiving Committee. After lunch, they met with Mayor Li Xianliang and others for talks. At 8:00 AM tomorrow, they will summon more than 30 people, including special envoys stationed in Qingdao from various Communist Party agencies and Mayor Li, Director Ge, and others for talks. At noon, they will attend a banquet hosted by Major General Harvey, Commander of the 6th Marine Division of the US Marine Corps, and leave Qingdao in the afternoon.

[Another Dispatch] After arriving in Qingdao, President Song decided: (1) To organize a Review Committee of the Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau in the Shandong Qingdao area to review matters related to the processing of received enemy and puppet property, and appointed Peng Shinian and other eight people as members, with Cheng Yifa as the secretary-general. (2) In order to sell sealed enemy and puppet materials at par prices to stabilize commodity prices, a Qingdao Daily Necessities Par Price Committee was organized, with Peng Shinian appointed as the chairman and Song Xueting as the deputy chairman. He also ordered that coal be transported from Qinhuangdao to Qingdao before the end of the lunar year, and then continuously supplied from Qinhuangdao and Lianyungang.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 5th] During his two days in Tianjin, President Song repeatedly convened responsible personnel from various military and government departments in the city to discuss matters related to economic recovery and reception. It was decided: (1) To coordinate the supply of coal, gasoline, alcohol, and other fuels in the Hebei-Pingjin area, it was decided to establish a Fuel Management Committee for the Hebei-Pingjin area. The committee's address will be in Tianjin, and Sun Yueqi, Wang Chongzhi, Shi Zhiren, Wang Yichen, Ling Mianzhi, Wang Xijun, and Yu Jukui were appointed as members, with Sun Yueqi as the chairman and Wang Chongzhi as the deputy chairman. The headquarters of the Hebei Garrison and the Eleventh War Zone will each send one person as a member. (2) A large amount of flour will soon be transferred from abroad and Shanghai to Tianjin for sale at par prices to supply civilian food. Song summoned Tong Guanxian, Director of the Good Samaritan Relief Administration, Tan Boyu, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Director of the Executive Yuan's Resident Office in Ping, and Zhang Ting'e, Mayor of Tianjin, and others to discuss and decide to organize a committee to be responsible for the distribution and pricing of par-price flour. (3) President Song inquired about the resumption of work in various factories with great concern. After listening to reports from various departments, he has ordered the special commissioners of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to quickly formulate concrete measures for the resumption of work and the cooperation of small factories in order to be reviewed and implemented. (4) The Tianjin Municipal Police Department will be responsible for guarding the reception warehouses in the Tianjin-Tanggu area, and the Hebei Provincial Government will send local police to assist. (5) A branch of the Enemy Property Investigation Committee will be established in Tianjin to investigate and report on concealed enemy property. (6) President Song paid close attention to the various land reclamation agencies and their businesses that Japan originally had in North China and has telegraphed Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Agriculture to come to Pingjin for on-site inspection and to formulate methods for continued operation. (7) General Locker, commander of the US Marine Corps, and General Walton, chief of staff, accompanied by Deputy Mayor Du Jianshi, visited President Song on the morning of the 5th to request instructions on the US military's takeover of Japanese warehouses in Tianjin and their handover to our side for reception. President Song has sent Yu Weiye, a special commissioner of the Ministry of Military Affairs, and Shi Nansheng, director of the Tianjin Office of the Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau in the Hebei-Pingjin area, and others to receive them.

### Chiang Ching-kuo Leaves Moscow; Soviet Generals to Assist Us in Receiving Provincial Capitals in the Northeast

[TASS, Moscow, 6th] Chiang Ching-kuo, the personal representative of Chairman Chiang, left Moscow on January 5th. The people who saw him off at the airport included Kerzhintsev, Director of the Treaty Department, Fu Bingchang, Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, and members of the Chinese Embassy.

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] It seems that China and the Soviet Union are trying to negotiate several difficult issues in a good atmosphere. It is learned that President Song and Mayor Shen Yi of Dalian discussed the Dalian reception issue and telegraphed the results of the discussion to Chiang Ching-kuo to negotiate with the Soviet side. According to Malinowski, Dalian is not within his defense zone, but belongs to the navy, so he cannot assist in the reception. The content of the telegram from Song and Shen to Chairman Chiang, as the reporter speculates, should be to ask him to inquire with the Soviet side about (1) the route for receiving Dalian, and (2) the An'dong reception issue. According to the reporter's investigation, the Northeast Headquarters recently sent a note to Malinowski, but the content is unknown. If Chairman Gao Xibing cannot obtain Soviet assistance to receive it like other chairmen, the reporter personally speculates that he may advance together with General Du Yuming's troops in the future. Regarding the issue of industry and mining, in addition to Xiong, Zhang, Chiang, and the top authorities in Chongqing and the diplomatic authorities, even the chairmen of the provinces have the regret of "丈二和尙，摸不着頭腦" (being completely baffled). Senior officials also believe that the Northeast industry and mining will be the first major event in the snow-covered Moscow negotiations. The plan for the large-scale airlift of National Army troops to the Northeast has been implicitly cancelled, but a part of the security team will still be airlifted there. This can be regarded as the most realistic annotation of Xiong Shihui's statement in Tianjin that the National Army will still be airlifted. Chairman Xiong once went to work to instruct the garrison on how to ensure the safety of the Beining Railway, which is the bridgehead for stepping into the Northeast, because Tangshan was once tense around New Year's Eve. Guan Jiyu, chairman of Songjiang, was originally scheduled to fly to his post on the 4th, but it was temporarily cancelled due to heavy snow in the Northeast and has been changed to today's departure. In addition to An'dong, the Soviet army will send liaison officers to assist in the reception of each provincial capital, but the widespread reception beyond the provincial capital is a major problem that will lie in front of the chairmen.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 5th] Guan Jiyu, Chairman of Songjiang Province, and the Secretary-General and reception committee members flew here from Ping.

### National Army Arrives in the Suburbs of Shenyang

[United Press, Tianjin, 6th] According to news received here, the National Army, which has been waiting for a long time to enter Shenyang, finally obtained Soviet approval today. However, on the condition that the National Army does not carry weapons into the city, several teams of National Army troops are now in the suburbs of Shenyang and are expected to enter the city at any time. Three Soviet liaison officers came to Tianjin from the Northeast yesterday and met with Chinese military officers here. The decision for the unarmed National Army to enter Shenyang was the result of recent repeated meetings. There have been no reports of conflicts between the Kuomintang and Communist forces in the Shenyang area. Most observers say that if there are a small number of Communist troops in the city after the National Army takes over Shenyang, they will surrender to the National Army.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 5th] The National Army by land will soon be stationed in Shenyang. General Peng Bisheng led many members of his staff and arrived here from Xinmin tonight to contact the Soviet army and handle the establishment of camps.

[Associated Press, Tianjin, 5th] It seems that the fact that General Du Yuming's large army will replace the Soviet army in Shenyang is about to become a reality. According to reports from the north, 5,000 people from Du's troops, who recently arrived via Huludao, are ready to advance at any time after the end of the Sino-Soviet negotiations. While General Du is waiting for orders to go to Shenyang, other activities in North China have also slowed down slightly, with small-scale harassment by Communist troops.

[Associated Press, Changchun, 6th] According to reports, the newly established "Special Security Regiment" is currently being airlifted from Beiping to Changchun. The regiment has a total of 4,000 members. Only 250 members flew to Changchun yesterday. It is expected that the same number of members will be transported there every day.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 5th] The first batch of National Army troops to fly here this afternoon were a part of the officers and soldiers of the Northeast Headquarters Security Team. They took ten giant planes. The first plane landed at 11:40 AM, and then a plane landed every three minutes. They were all wearing leather coats and hats and were fully armed. Although they were in a cold wind of minus 20 degrees, they were still in high spirits. On their way from the airport to the barracks, many people gathered on the roadside. Allied soldiers and Japanese expatriates also waved their hands to express their welcome in the crowd. The people of the Northeast have been waiting for the National Army to fly here for a long time. Now that they have witnessed the National Army descending from the sky, their joy cannot be described in words.

### Du Yuming and Others Inspect Fuxin National Army Taking Over Beipiao Chaoyang

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 5th] After the important town of Rehe, Fuxin, was taken over, Chief Du Yuming, accompanied by Chairman Liu Duoquan, braved the snow to inspect it on the 4th and made arrangements for its defense. Fuxin is a new city developed by the Japanese, and the project is only two-thirds completed. There are nine coal mines in total, and eight have already started operation. The city streets were damaged by the Communist army. Furthermore, Beipiao was completely taken over by the National Army at 1:00 PM on the 4th, and railway and telephone lines are being urgently repaired. The coal mine there is one of the important mineral resources in the Northeast. According to reports received by the Chief's Office, the power plant there has been destroyed, but it is expected to be repaired and operational in about two or three days. In addition, in recent days, citizen representatives from more than 20 counties including Zhangwu, Shenyang, Liaoyang, Liaozhong, and Tiecen have come to the Chief's Office in Jinzhou to pay their respects without prior agreement. They were all received and comforted by Chief of Staff Zhao Jiaxiang, who instructed them to return to their respective places to maintain order and await the National Army.

[Another dispatch] The National Army was ordered on the 3rd to take over Chaoyang. Due to heavy snow, it took two days to reach Chaoyang, entering the city at 9:00 AM on the 5th, and the takeover was completed by 5:00 PM. Army Commander Zhao Gongwu has personally gone to Chaoyang to oversee everything. It is reported that the Rehe Provincial Government will soon move there to conduct business.

### Sino-French Relations After the Biltin Incident

The new French Ambassador, Mr. Meyrier, arrived in the wartime capital (Chongqing) by plane on the 5th of this month. After a short rest, he will surely meet with the Chairman (Chiang Kai-shek) to present his credentials. The Ambassador's arrival in Chongqing comes the day after the French warship "Biltin" illegally carried war criminals away from Shanghai. The situation arising from this incident has caused high dissatisfaction and anger among the Chinese people, casting a shadow over Sino-French relations. The new French Ambassador arrives in the wartime capital at this time, and the mission he bears to promote Sino-French relations is undoubtedly of great importance. We would like to take this opportunity to briefly look forward to Sino-French relations.

First, we must point out that in the effort to defeat the Japanese invaders, France did not shoulder the responsibility it should have, and on the contrary, in the early stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, France actively helped the Japanese invaders. However, in the post-war Pacific situation, we still believe that there is no conflict of interest with France, and even in northern Vietnam, China has replaced the United Nations in undertaking the task of accepting the surrender. Our Chairman Chiang has repeatedly stated that China has no territorial ambitions in Vietnam or even Southeast Asia. As such, Sino-French relations in the Pacific should be close, and in the current international situation, Sino-French relations should be even closer. But at this very moment, the Biltin incident occurred, which is truly an unfortunate event in Sino-French relations caused unilaterally by France.

Regarding the Biltin incident, there are at least two aspects to it: (1) the ship illegally carrying war criminals out of the country, and (2) the existence or abolition of French consular jurisdiction in China. Regarding the ship illegally carrying war criminals out of the country, this is a contempt for our national sovereignty and a violation of international practice. The French Consul-General in Shanghai failed to prevent it beforehand and failed to remedy it afterward, and the ship's captain and the French Consul in Shanghai should jointly bear the responsibility for damaging Sino-French relations. All the war criminals carried away by the ship should be immediately returned to Shanghai to await trial. At the same time, the ship's captain and the French Consul in Shanghai should apologize to our government authorities and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again. Before this case is resolved, all French naval and land forces should not be allowed to enter China. These measures have already been protested by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the French government, and it is deeply believed that a resolution can be reached.

Another more serious issue arising from the Biltin incident is the existence or abolition of French consular jurisdiction in China. According to the protest lodged by the Shanghai Municipal Government with the French Consulate-General in Shanghai: The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent Secretary Lu to the French Consulate-General in Shanghai to deliver the protest letter. The Consul-General replied verbally that the Consulate-General did indeed arrest a French Nazi, Caccopino, based on the consular jurisdiction stipulated in the old French treaty, and imprisoned him on the French warship and will send him back to his country in accordance with French law. It shows that the French Consulate-General in Shanghai not only openly admitted that France still enjoys extraterritorial rights in China based on the old treaty, but also unilaterally arrested criminals in our country. The latter is of course based on the former, but without the latter, the former is only an expression of will without action. The French Consul in Shanghai not only stated that France still enjoys consular jurisdiction in China, but has also unilaterally exercised this power. The importance of this is greater than the Biltin's unauthorized departure from Shanghai with war criminals.

Although the new Sino-French treaty is still awaiting signature, the old treaty has long been abolished in law and in fact and no longer exists. Since Paris was captured by the Nazis and the Vichy government acted perversely, our country not only withdrew its embassies and consulates in France, but in fact severed diplomatic relations with France. The establishment of the Vichy government made France a vassal of Hitler. Although General de Gaulle struggled hard abroad, at that time there was still no organization like the National Liberation Committee established in North Africa that could represent the interests of France and be generally recognized by the international community. Due to the establishment of the Vichy government and the failure of the new government to emerge, France was unable to fulfill its international obligations, and the old Sino-French treaty and the old Sino-Portuguese treaty have naturally been abolished in law with the collapse of France itself. As for the French concession areas attached to the old Sino-French treaty, they no longer exist, and the French government has long been aware of this. Just look at the fact that there is no longer the shameful term "French Concession" in Shanghai today, and it is clear. However, today, the French Consul-General in Shanghai, on the one hand, publicly recognizes that the "French Concession" has long been abolished, but on the other hand, says that the arrest of criminals is based on the old treaty, which is a truly absurd act, leaving a stain on Sino-French relations after the war!

We feel even more regrettable that some French expatriates are still unaware of the new international situation and are filled with past superiority and outdated concepts. In World War II, France not only failed to fulfill its due obligations, but in a sense, even condoned and even supported Japanese aggression. They should be thinking about how to correct past mistakes and wash away their shame. To put it bluntly, their traditional sense of superiority and outdated concepts are no longer in line with the new situation after World War II! The occurrence of this Biltin incident, to put it more seriously, the Chinese people have the right to demand that our government declare a break in diplomatic relations with France before a legal solution is obtained. Because we believe that this is not just the Biltin incident, but a test of other countries encroaching on China's sovereignty after the war. We must resolutely prevent these attempts from succeeding.

The new French Ambassador has been in China for many years. This time he has come to China from post-war Europe, which is appropriate when there is a shadow over Sino-French relations. With the Ambassador's talents, we firmly believe that he will be able to quickly clear these shadows and make Sino-French relations more and more intimate. China and France need to cooperate in the Pacific and in the reconstruction of the world situation; China can help France, and France can also help China. We must not allow the mistakes of the Captain of the Biltin and the French Consul-General in Shanghai to become a factor in damaging the friendly relations between China and France.

### Japanese Cabinet Holds Emergency Meeting Yesterday, Will Remove Aggressors, List of Dismissed Cabinet Members Sent to MacArthur for Review

[This newspaper] San Francisco, 6th, midnight broadcast: This morning at 10:00 AM, the Japanese cabinet convened an emergency meeting that lasted a long time, ending at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. The central discussion was on how to implement the order issued by MacArthur, and the issue of the formation of the cabinet members was also mentioned. According to the order, Japanese officials who attempted to conquer the world are prohibited from participating in administrative work. The cabinet meeting convened this morning was originally scheduled to be held yesterday, but was postponed to this morning because three cabinet members were not in Tokyo. Although the results of the discussion this morning have not been announced, the Japanese government has begun to draft a list of ministers who will be removed and submit it to MacArthur for review. It is scheduled to be announced after the cabinet meeting on Monday.

[United Press, Tokyo, 6th] According to Secretary-General of the Cabinet Tsuda, the cabinet may only be reorganized, or the entire cabinet may resign, depending on the opinion of Prime Minister Shidehara. Shidehara believes that it is not yet time to decide. Sources said that Shidehara may reorganize the cabinet, but not resign en masse, or ask the Supreme Commander to allow his cabinet members to remain in office temporarily, because the directive stipulates that key personnel may remain in office temporarily. The Asahi Shimbun reported that Deputy Secretary-General Mikami said that Foreign Minister Yoshida will probably go to the Supreme Command to learn the details of the directive and request MacArthur to allow all Japanese cabinet members to remain in office temporarily until after the general election. The date of the general election has not yet been determined, but the Supreme Command said that it has not received a request to meet with MacArthur. Since the arrival of US Secretary of War Patterson in Japan, the Supreme Command has been extremely busy. To implement MacArthur's directive, the Japanese government has prepared two laws, which are quite complicated and are an emergency way to implement the conditions set by the Potsdam Declaration. Some Japanese newspapers believe that according to MacArthur's directive, only Shidehara and Yoshida among the Japanese cabinet members are not tainted by aggression.

[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] The Japanese government has today drafted laws to remove all officials who led Japan in the war. This is the first concrete result of MacArthur's directive to eliminate aggressors. According to a cabinet spokesman: This law will be submitted to the cabinet meeting on Monday. The Asahi Shimbun's new editorial said: Prime Minister Shidehara and his cabinet may resign en masse because of this new directive. It seems that the political parties are also bound to collapse, because most of the candidates for the upcoming parliamentary elections are wartime dregs.

### Whether All Japanese Cabinet Members Will Resign En Masse Will Be Revealed Today or Tomorrow

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 6th] According to a Japanese spokesman: The Japanese cabinet will not resign. It is expected that the cabinet will continue to hold a cabinet meeting tonight to discuss the urgent question of whether MacArthur's new order will force the entire cabinet to resign, or whether some cabinet members will be forced to resign. Prime Minister Shidehara was unable to attend the morning cabinet meeting due to a cold, and Foreign Minister Yoshida also did not attend. At the cabinet meeting, MacArthur ordered that all officials who led the Japanese people in the war should be removed. The cabinet meeting began to discuss how to implement this order. When the Associated Press reporter asked Horikiri, who attended the cabinet meeting, he smiled and shook his head, saying he did not know. According to well-informed Japanese sources, no matter what the fate of the cabinet, Interior Minister Horikiri may be forced to resign. Foreign Minister Yoshida met with Shidehara yesterday and then met with the Emperor to discuss MacArthur's new order. It is said that MacArthur's new order has raised the issue of the existence of the Japanese House of Peers. Twenty-eight members of the House of Peers have been arrested as suspected war criminals, fifteen of whom have already submitted their resignations voluntarily. It is speculated by the Japanese that another fifteen will be forced to resign. The House of Peers has a total of 412 members.

### At Least Six Japanese Cabinet Members Will Be Removed, Including the Minister of Interior, Minister of Agriculture, and Minister of Education

The most well-informed sources said that Shidehara may maintain the current cabinet and only dismiss these cabinet members and replace them with new people. However, the Social Democratic Party demanded that the Shidehara Cabinet resign en masse. The Asahi Shimbun's editorial today also said that the Shidehara Cabinet is mediocre and incompetent, cannot be responsible, and should step down.

[This newspaper] San Francisco, 6th, midnight broadcast: Today, all newspapers in Tokyo unanimously believe that MacArthur's new directive will give Japan new leadership. The Mainichi Shimbun commented: "Our past reforms have all been superficial." The Asahi Shimbun pointed out that MacArthur's new order is "a further step in building a new Japan."

### US State Department Official Talks About MacArthur's Authority: He May Have the Power to Appoint a New Cabinet

[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] State Department officials said today that if the Shidehara cabinet falls due to MacArthur's directive to eliminate militarists from the Japanese government, it is believed that MacArthur may have the power to appoint a new cabinet. The communiqué of the Moscow Conference of Three Foreign Ministers had reserved the power to appoint a new Japanese cabinet to the Four-Power Control Committee, but State Department officials pointed out that Secretary of State Byrnes told reporters on Thursday that the communiqué contained a clause empowering MacArthur to supplement the vacant cabinet members, so the regulations of the communiqué have greatly reduced its effectiveness. When a reporter asked whether the committee only had the right to appoint Shidehara's successor, the State Department official replied: "According to the directive, MacArthur may appoint people to continue to maintain the current cabinet." Observers said that even if the entire cabinet resigns, MacArthur can appoint one person today and another tomorrow, supplementing the vacancies entirely on an individual basis. The State Department also said that it has not received any consultation from the Soviet Union regarding the current Japanese cabinet crisis.

### I Believe Our Exports to the US Can Easily Recover to Pre-War Levels; Various Obstacles Urgently Need to Be Overcome

[San Francisco, US Information Service, 6th] Collier, Chairman of the San Francisco Bay Area Branch of the China-America Business Association, reported in the December issue of "Argonaut" magazine: According to Chinese official estimates, a large number of exports will be shipped to the United States in the coming years. Collier said that estimates show that after the transitional period of reviving production and transportation in the formerly occupied areas, China will ship more basic exports than before the 1937 war. However, Collier pointed out in the report that although there are many optimistic signs from China, there are still many obstacles to overcome before Chinese export trade reaches pre-war levels. Collier continued in the report that it is generally expected that China's future expanded export trade will be operated by private enterprises, but Chinese authorities say that the Commodity Inspection Bureau established by the government will continue to work to improve the quality of major exports. China's main products are tung oil, bristles, raw silk, wool, tea, eggs, and [blanks]. Other Chinese export products expected to be exported in large quantities are casings, leather, oilseeds, soybeans, feathers, medicines, hemp, jute and ramie, and tungsten ore. Some finished products that had a large market overseas before the war can also occupy an important position in exports after the war, especially items such as handkerchiefs, linen, embroidery, lace, and hairnets. During the period from 1935 to 1937, the United States did not receive many exports from China. Chinese authorities believe that in the post-war period, Chinese exports to the United States will increase significantly. Collier said that obstacles that must be overcome before reopening trade relations include the stability of China's currency system and the establishment of a reasonable exchange rate for the US dollar. Another obstacle is the lack of domestic and international transportation in China.

About 40 schools, including Nanyang Middle School, Daguang Primary and Secondary School, Minsheng Primary and Secondary School, Boren Middle School, Chongshi Elementary School, and Minghui Elementary School, attended.

(2) The official starting date for the next semester is February 22. (3) The tuition fee is tentatively set at 12,000 yuan for elementary schools, 16,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 20,000 yuan for senior high schools. (4) Teachers' salaries are allocated at 70% of the total tuition income of the school. (5) Most schools in this city do not have sports fields.

(6) The tuition fees for private schools this semester are low and teachers' salaries are meager, which has led to most teachers abandoning their jobs halfway, causing great distress. However, if the tuition fees are too high, parents cannot afford them, and if the tuition fees are low, it is impossible to hire teachers. As for the board of directors of private schools in this city, there are actually very few who can bear economic responsibility. For the sake of education for most students in the city, specific methods should be proposed and the authorities should be requested to maintain it.

Lost to the Jewish Team by Two to One: Poor Communication is the Fatal Wound

Yesterday the weather was clear and sunny. It was a holiday, and in the Jiaoyuan Group A football match, Qingbai, a rising new force of Chinese, played against the Jewish team. Qingbai's first oath attracted the attention of football fans, and Changping Road was crowded with fans, which was a grand occasion.

The match started at 2:30 pm. The Jewish team originally planned to invite the Italian players McNitti and Boqi, both of whom had brought their football shoes, but they did not appear on the field in the end. It was heard that the Italian Overseas Chinese Authority opposed it. As a result, the two Italian generals did not appear on the field, and the entire Jewish team responded to the battle. Everyone thought that Qingbai could take advantage of this good opportunity and capture the Jewish team in one fell swoop. Unexpectedly, the result was so tragic that they lost by one to two, which made thousands of fans sigh in unison.

In the first half, Li Shuoyou scored the first goal, but was soon retaliated by Wen Tuo, making it a 1-1 draw. In the second half, Mai Lexi scored a goal, making it 2-1. Qingbai tried its best to counterattack, but it was unable to recover, and as a result, it lost to the Jewish team by 2-1. The scattered and unregulated forwards of Qingbai, losing contact, were the main cause of the failure.

Jewish Team:

Cohen, Mania, Leibai Ge, Lao Shi, Mai Lexi, Tang Naixu, Stane, Kapu Siding, Wen Tuo, Lai Liao, Li Fan

### French Warship Transports War Criminals from Shanghai; Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs Lodges Protest; French Consul General Hopes to Maintain Sino-French Friendship

Chen Guolian, Director of the Diplomatic Ministry's Shanghai Office, who was in Beijing on official business, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning after receiving a report that the French warship *Bélier* had illegally transported French war criminals away from Shanghai. He will personally oversee all negotiations related to this case. Yesterday, Mr. Chen summoned Secretary Lü and other key officials to consult in detail about the initial negotiations in this case. It is understood that Foreign Minister Wang Shijie has directly lodged a protest with the French government. Before receiving instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Shanghai, no new measures will be taken for the time being by the Shanghai Office.

French Consul General in Shanghai, M. Ferey, to clarify his position on the *Bélier*'s transporting the French traitor Cacopino from Shanghai to Saigon, received reporters twice yesterday and made a statement. He said: "The *Bélier* incident has been reported in newspapers several times recently. This is essentially a local matter, and we deeply believe that the Chinese and French governments will definitely find a satisfactory solution in the near future. I hope that the newly appointed French Ambassador to China, Mr. Meyrier, who recently arrived in Chongqing, will take positive measures to promote Sino-French relations. Mr. Meyrier is a good friend of China and will surely promote Sino-French friendship in the shortest possible time. As for myself, I am constantly working to strengthen the traditional friendship between China and France in Shanghai."

[Our Newspaper Report] French Consul General Ferey stated yesterday that the *Bélier*'s illegal departure was a local matter. However, diplomatic circles yesterday solemnly stated that they believe this demonstrates the French side's failure to respect our national sovereignty. Not only should the French Consul General bear full responsibility, but the French government should also bear considerable responsibility.

French Consul General's Actions Are Illegal

Regarding the French warship *Bélier* disregarding our country's protests and transporting the war criminal Cacopino from Shanghai to Saigon, all sectors of the city are paying close attention. Our reporter specially interviewed a leading figure in Shanghai's diplomatic community who is not currently in office, to inquire about his views on the case. He said: The French Consul General's handling of this case is clearly inappropriate. According to international law, although the treaty abolishing consular jurisdiction between China and France has not been formally ratified, the draft was signed by both countries long ago. Moreover, on May 19, 1943, the Chinese government informed the French Chargé d'Affaires, declaring that all consular jurisdiction and other privileges obtained by France under unequal treaties were abolished. In December 1945, the French Chargé d'Affaires informed the Chinese government that all French consular courts had ceased hearing cases. Based on the above, the French consulate police's arrest of the French war criminal Cacopino was illegal. Furthermore, our municipal government and the Diplomatic Ministry's Shanghai Office had already lodged verbal and written protests after the arrest of the suspect. However, the French Consul General ignored our protests and privately escorted the suspect away from Shanghai on a French warship. This action is a contempt for our national sovereignty.

The Case Is Serious and Must Be Vigorously Pursued

The Consul claimed in his conversation with reporters that he had only arrived in Shanghai from Paris a month and a half ago and was unfamiliar with handling this matter. This explanation is an attempt to shirk responsibility and has no basis in international law. The Consul General also stated that he had not received any notification from the French government regarding the abolition of consular jurisdiction or the handling of French war criminals. This statement is even more of an excuse, as the French Chargé d'Affaires stated in his communication to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the suspension of consular court hearings had been notified to all French consulates in China. How could the French Consul in Shanghai not have received notification from the French Embassy? The diplomat continued, "This illegal arrest and private transport of a criminal seems to be a planned action. The French Consul General deliberately damaged Chinese sovereignty and created a *fait accompli* in order to gain a diplomatic precedent, attempting to continue to use it in the future." The diplomat further emphasized to the reporter: "If our government does not take a tough stance and seek effective solutions in this case, all countries may use this case as a precedent, rendering the various treaties abolishing consular jurisdiction meaningless. The gravity of this case is enough to warrant the close attention of our government and the public."

Chinese Courts Have the Right to Sanction

The diplomat added that the French Consul General is a commercial official, not a diplomat. Therefore, for his illegal actions, he should bear all the responsibilities stipulated by Chinese law and be subject to Chinese law and court decisions. The existence of the French Consulate General's police force is illegal, and Chinese military police should be able to legally restrain them. Before the case is resolved, the Chinese government should be able to legally suspend all activities of the French Consulate General and prohibit French merchant ships and warships from entering Chinese ports.

### General Manager of Sincere Company, Li Ze, Held Puppet Positions; Employees Report Him to Authorities

[Our Newspaper Report] The staff of the Sincere Company have publicly reported the crimes of the company's General Manager Li Ze for collaborating with the enemy, attracting close attention from the citizens of Shanghai. Our reporter has inquired from all parties and compiled the following report:

Held Puppet Positions During the Occupation

Li Ze, also known as Ruotao, is a native of Shiqi, Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, and is 51 years old. After Shanghai fell, Li served as a "Director of the Puppet National Commercial Control Association," a "Special Commissioner of the Puppet Sixteen Commodities Evaluation Committee," a "Chairman of the Puppet Enemy Property Committee," and heavily invested in the puppet Jiangnan Shipyard. He even donated 20,000 catties of all the water pipes and iron from Sincere Company to the enemy.

Sold Enemy Goods Before the Incident

Before the Incident, the company's business was not very prosperous. Li Ze went to Japan to order large quantities of wool and other goods, hoping to obtain even greater profits. He used the enemy's protection to evade customs duties, change labels, and falsely claim that the goods were products of European and American countries for sale. This was exposed by enthusiastic anti-Japanese elements, causing a great uproar in society at the time.

Police Summons Refused

Now that victory has been achieved, Shu Yueqiao and others, former waiters at the New Capital Hotel attached to the company, have filed a report. Although Li Ze has been summoned by the police, he still refuses to appear. Yesterday, as it was a Sunday, the company was closed as usual, but the windows and surrounding walls were covered with newspapers reporting Li Ze's accusations, marked in red ink. Passersby gathered to watch, blocking the road.

### High Court Criminal Division to Try Three Traitors Today

### Vacant Houses Left by Japanese Residents to Be Distributed in a Unified Manner

Japanese residents in the city have continued to be repatriated over the past month. The vacant houses left by them will be distributed in a unified manner by the responsible authorities. However, disputes are inevitable. Before the Japanese residents withdrew, or during the period when the houses were sealed by the authorities, some owners rented them out privately without applying for their return. Regarding these disputes, our reporter inquired with relevant authorities yesterday. They stated that if the houses occupied by Japanese residents are not enemy or puppet properties, the lease rights of the houses should belong to the Japanese residents. After the Japanese residents are ordered to concentrate or be repatriated, the continuing lease rights of the vacant houses should belong to the receiving agency. The owners should wait for the Standing Committee to make unified distribution arrangements and should not use excuses to obstruct and cause difficulties for the tenants, leading to disputes, unless they are indeed being taken back for their own use.

### Workers' Severance Pay from Enemy Factories Passes Five Hundred Million Yuan

[Our Newspaper Report] It is learned that the workers' severance pay from Japanese-owned factories in the city has been approved by the Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee.

U.S. Military Transfers Medical Supplies

The U.S. Army Headquarters reported yesterday that the U.S. Army Medical Corps transferred medicines and hospital equipment to the Shanghai Branch of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), providing great assistance to the sick here. The medicines transferred by the U.S. military to UNRRA in November last year were as follows: (1) Medicines and hospital equipment worth 500,000 US dollars, including two iron lungs; (2) 2,150 hospital beds (distributed to three American hospitals); (3) Medicines including vitamin pills, penicillin, glucose, and anesthetics. Before arriving in Shanghai, the U.S. military dropped various medicines near concentration camps by plane for use by people in the camps. Afterwards, the quantity of medicines transferred to UNRRA was very large. The Director of the Supply Department of the U.S. Army Medical Corps said that penicillin has the greatest use in China today, but these medicines are for relief purposes only and are strictly prohibited from being traded on the black market. Once discovered, severe punishment will be imposed.

Relief Administration Sets Up Hospitals

In order to promote health facilities, the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is planning to establish 660 hospitals in Shanghai, Nanjing, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Changchun, and other places in the near future.

It is learned that various agencies and public organizations will hold regular meetings to discuss implementation methods.

### Enemy Property Management Bureau to Sell Large Quantities of Materials at Reduced Prices, Including Five Items: Sugar, Oil, Coal, Cloth, and Soap

[Our Newspaper Report] The Lunar New Year is approaching, and Chinese people traditionally purchase large quantities of daily necessities at this time. In order to prevent price fluctuations caused by this, the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau has decided to sell various materials at reduced prices in the near future. The items include: (1) 700 tons of sugar, which has already started selling; (2) 200,000 bolts of cloth, which will be distributed to the market by the China Textile Construction Company; (3) Edible oil; (4) Soap; (5) Coal. The quantities of the last three items have not yet been determined and will be adjusted according to market needs. In the future, whenever prices tend to rise, the Bureau will use rapid means to sell materials at reduced prices, so as to stabilize the city's prices in the long term.

Selling Flour at Low Prices to Prevent Speculation

Since the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration began selling flour to retailers at reduced prices, it has been done three times. However, because the selling price is too low, hoarders and speculators can easily take the opportunity to purchase in false names, attempting to manipulate the market. Therefore, since the start of the third phase of sales on the 4th, no new registrations have been accepted. Only cake stalls and noodle shops that have already registered and passed the review are eligible for distribution.

Fishing Boats Sent Out to Sea to Catch Fish Return to Shanghai

### Robbers Actually Take Public Reserve Funds When Dividing Loot; Police Search Hotels and Finally Face the Law

[Our Newspaper Report] Wang Zhi, a native of Nanjing whose original profession was printing, committed robbery during the occupation and was sentenced to eight years in prison. He was later released under the puppet government's "amnesty." However, his thieving nature remained unchanged, and he joined forces with four "intellectual youths," Zheng Yafen, Zhou Wenhai, Xia Yiping, and Jiang Hailin. They repeatedly robbed seven locations: No. 15 Liuying Village on Datong Road, No. 7 Jinyu Lane on Zhongzheng Road, No. 166 Runkang Lane on Jing'an Temple Road, No. 315 Tongfu Road, No. 4 Guifu Lane on Shunchang Road, No. 15, Lane 27 Yunnan Road, and No. 166 Jinxiang Lane on Shanhai Pass Road and Chibang Road. The total value of the gold and jewelry robbed was 20 million yuan in legal tender. Each robbery was meticulously planned and well-arranged, so the case was never solved. The method of dividing the loot was also extremely fair, and a public reserve fund was set aside for daily expenses, lodging, and meals. Finally, because the funds obtained from the robbery had been used up, they were planning to carry out another robbery in the Dadongnan Hotel on West Xinqiao Street when the police team searched the room. Unable to escape, four handguns were found and confiscated at the scene, and they were taken to the bureau for questioning. They confessed to robbing the above-mentioned locations. They were immediately transferred to the Military Law Department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for investigation. After several interrogations, all the victims were summoned and the evidence was confirmed. The entire case was investigated and completed on the 5th, and each was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for life.

### Unexpected Guests Suddenly Come to Cause Trouble; Shooting and Wounding Neighbors

[Our Newspaper Report] At 5:05 PM yesterday at No. 9, Lane 288, Yuezhou Road, Hudong Tianhouli, a man wearing a blue cloth gown suddenly broke in and asked if Cai Amao was at home. The second landlord, surnamed Chen, replied that there was no such person here and told him that he was in the attic of No. 17 across the street. The man then went to that location. At that time, Cai was busy preparing medicine with his wife, Chen, because one of his sons had a severe case of measles. He suddenly heard someone calling and was about to step out of the door when the visitor had already gone upstairs. Before they could exchange words, he began punching him indiscriminately, from the third floor to the lower floor. Cai could not resist and shouted for help. The man then ran out of the back door. Cai followed closely, chasing him to the center of the lane. Qian Xiaolong, a resident of No. 7 (30 years old, working at a pig shop on Fair Road), was returning from outside and saw Cai chasing a man madly. Suspecting that he was a bandit, he bravely stepped forward and hugged him around the waist. Unexpectedly, the man pulled out a handgun from his side and fired a shot, hitting him in the right side of his face. He fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The perpetrator, seeing that he had caused a serious disaster, ran out of the lane. The people in the lane chased closely, reaching Gaoyang Road, the perpetrator flashed into a small lane, went to Rue Auguste Boppe, and fired several shots as a warning. In the end, he took off his shoes and fled over the wall. Zhang Xiaolong, who had been injured, was sent to the Shanghai Sanatorium for treatment by ambulance after being summoned by the police. Afterwards, the reporter visited Cai's residence. According to his wife, Chen, Cai was a foreign coppersmith and is currently unemployed, making a living as a peddler. He has four children, making life difficult. When asked if this person came to discuss something, she replied that she did not know him. As for the rumors that the case involved a love affair, it was not true, or it may be related to a feud. It is learned that the suspect's name is Wang Shen, and the Tilanqiao Branch is currently investigating.

Commercial News

### Last Week's Fluctuations in Gold and Banknotes Were Slight; Yarn, Cotton, Silk Fabric, and Coal All Rose

Finance: Last week, Shanghai's financial market saw booming Chinese and foreign stocks due to the year-end holidays. Bill turnover was frequent. Interbank lending rates remained stable at three jiao, while shadow interest rates hovered around the one jiao mark. In December, a substantial amount of legal tender funds flowed into Shanghai from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, leading to two phenomena: (1) an increasing number of people seeking high-interest loans, and (2) surplus funds rushing into the Chinese and foreign stock markets, as well as the cotton yarn and cloth markets. Due to the postponement of raising gold prices, coupled with the gradual convergence of gold prices between Chongqing and Shanghai, and the non-disclosure of exchange rates, major paper dealers and speculators sold, causing prices to fluctuate minimally between 770,000 yuan and 813,000 yuan. Trading was sluggish, and the week closed at 797,000 yuan, down 16,000 yuan from the previous week. Regarding U.S. dollars, with the exchange rate against Taiwan fixed at 37 yuan, the indirect exchange rate in Shanghai was only 1,111.5 yuan. Some importers' refusal to accept U.S. dollars initially caused a drop of 40 to 50 yuan due to selling pressure. However, yarn factories and daily necessities manufacturers bought in when prices fell, using them to procure imported raw materials, bringing the price back to 1,405 yuan at the close, down 25 yuan from the previous week. Foreign news reported that a U.S. cotton loan of 33 million yuan has been established, allowing the purchase of 275,000 to 300,000 bales of cotton, each weighing 500 pounds, equivalent to 1.23 million to 1.35 million dan in our country's market. For the next year, the textile industry will no longer need to search for U.S. dollars and foreign exchange. Hong Kong currency, both old and new, experienced an oversupply among money exchangers, leading to a drop of 10 yuan for old currency and a weakening of 1 yuan for new currency.

Securities: Due to the conflict between the Nationalists and Communists and the airlift of Chinese troops to Changchun, Class C unified bonds reached a peak of 900 yuan. The other classes, D and E, were also more popular than A and B. Considering the longer repayment period and the inscription of "repayment of principal in national currency," Class E was even more promising than Class C. In general, speculation dominated the bond market. The massive 900 billion legal tender issued during the war will need to be reorganized after the war. The potential adoption of a new currency is a factor driving the bullish outlook for unified bonds. Although the ban on trading Chinese stocks has not been lifted, over 400 securities association members have registered. Furthermore, the cotton and silk weaving industries are performing exceptionally well, leading to a shortage of circulating shares of yarn and silk factories. Gold merchants, Guangdong businessmen, and a Mr. Wang from the paper industry bought in, particularly focusing on the popular Wing On Textile Factory stock, which suddenly reached a peak of 1,000 yuan and closed at 980 yuan, up 160 yuan from the previous week. Large cultural stocks, such as the Commercial Press with a par value of 100 yuan, were traded at 40,000 yuan. Foreign stocks experienced a surge due to the resumption of operations by foreign factories and firms, and the acceptance of shareholder transfer procedures with official seals. Foreigners and major speculators from Guangdong aggressively purchased Jardine Matheson, HSBC, and Union Insurance, leading to a surge of 800 to 1,800 yuan from the previous week. HSBC, which owns the most magnificent building on Zhongzheng Road, closed at a new high price of 7,300 yuan.

Commodities: Regarding goods, an average of 15,000 dan of rice arrived daily. The city authorities are also ordering Siamese rice, keeping prices stable and weak. Flour prices are firm due to the high price of 9,000 yuan per bag in Tianjin, resulting in increased shipments from the north. The Xinghua and Quanzhou gangs bought soybeans, while Taiwan, Shantou, and Xiamen gangs actively purchased soybean cakes. Each cake, weighing 50 jin, reached a high of 2,075 yuan. Cottonseed cake, used as fuel by factories, reached a high of 2,150 yuan. Vegetable oil and sugar prices were slightly lower due to the planned sale of subsidized vegetable oil and sugar. However, in inland areas such as Changzhou, oil prices were higher than in Shanghai due to a shortage of soybean raw materials. Cotton yarn prices initially rose due to purchases of 20-count yarn by Shantou, Xiamen, Nanjing, and Hangzhou. Subsequently, prices surged further due to increased demand for Double Horse 20-count yarn from Hong Kong and Guangdong, reaching a new high of 850,000 yuan. Since the puppet cotton control association purchased all cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai in 1943, the supply of yarn in Shanghai has been scarce, especially for renowned old brands, which are particularly difficult to find. Customer gangs exploited this weakness and accumulated stocks. As a result, while rice prices have risen 700 times compared to before the war, yarn prices have risen 3,400 times. Cotton cloth prices also rose, with Sichuanese merchants purchasing Shilin-colored cloth and dyeing factories aggressively buying white cotton fabric. Dragon Head 12-pound cloth reached a new high price of 36,000 yuan per bolt. Cotton factories and cotton brokers aggressively accumulated stocks, pushing the price of Nantong American cotton to a high of 87,000 yuan per dan, more than doubling the low point in mid-December. Raw silk exports to foreign firms were strong, rising by 100,000 yuan. Artificial silk factories absorbed supplies, leading to an increase of 45,000 yuan. Silk fabrics were mediocre, while knitted goods followed the yarn market upward. Chinese cigarette factories were distributing goods, while British and American cigarettes weakened along with Chinese cigarettes. Fuel prices rose due to winter demand and low inventories, with white coal chunks rising by 40,000 yuan per ton, and firewood coal balls rising by 100 to 200 yuan each. Matches remained firm, while Western soap and candles saw a slight drop due to reduced orders from Sichuanese merchants. (Zhong Bo)

### Exporters Eager for Early Determination of Exchange Rates

The new exchange rate remains uncertain, causing considerable anxiety among export merchants. According to a certain exporter: China's major export commodities are still tea, tung oil, pig bristles, raw silk, and wool. Before the war, China's tea production accounted for 45% of the world's total, with an annual output of approximately 900 million pounds and exports of over 219,700 metric tons. Tung oil accounted for over 94% of the world's output, with Sichuan, Hunan, Guangxi, and Guizhou provinces, as well as western Hubei and southern Shaanxi, being the main producing areas. Guangxi boasts thousand-year-old tung oil, with annual exports reaching over 134,000 metric tons, and the national annual output is over 100,000 metric tons. Pig bristles have a rich market potential, with annual exports reaching over 5,100 metric tons. Raw silk exports reach over 1,700 metric tons, and wool exports are approximately 132,000 metric tons. If a new exchange rate can be determined soon, trade in these commodities will undoubtedly become more active.

### Hard White Lead Wire Remains Strong

Hard white lead wire, which is normally cheaper than new lead wire, has recently become more popular due to its wider range of uses and limited market inventory. As a result, its asking price is now higher than that of new lead wire. Currently, sizes 11, 12, and 13 are selling for 30,000 yuan per dan, almost the same as the peak price.

Although the foreign exchange rate has not been determined, import merchants have already placed numerous orders. According to a paper industry executive, the first batch of orders is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of this month.

Since the dumping of Crane brand milk powder, domestic milk powder in Shanghai has been severely affected. It is understood that the industry has decided to reduce the price of fresh milk in order to reduce costs and achieve self-reliance. The current selling price has been reduced to around 1,000 yuan, while Crane brand milk powder has increased in price.

Following the initial implementation of industrial and commercial registration in Shanghai, Nanjing has also launched its registration program. Tianjin and Beijing are preparing to do so.

### Chongqing Price Figures

The chaos in the commercial market in 1945 was unprecedented since the start of the war. Currency inflation was over a thousand times that of before the war, and social purchasing power was less than 10% of pre-war levels. Prices rose to nearly 2,400 times pre-war levels. The following are the Chongqing price indices for recent years from the United Credit Reporting Institute (with the price index in 1937 as the base of 1):

(Price Index in 1937 = 1)

1937: 1.1

1938: 1.3

1939: 2

1940: 6

1941: 17

1942: 51

1943: 136

1944: 316

1945: January: 492

February: 566

March: 734

April: 963

May: 1040

June: 1084

July: 2304

August: 2416

September: 2082

October: 2037

November: 2373

December: [Blank]

The above table shows that prices in the latter half of 1945 doubled compared to the first half. Prices in 1945 rose approximately seven times compared to 1944. Nationally, Chongqing ranked first in price increases, except for Kunming. (Before the outbreak of the Pacific War, Chongqing had the highest prices among major cities in the country. However, since 1941, Kunming took over due to the dominance of foreign capital and rampant speculation. According to statistics, the price index in Chongqing in August 1945 was 2,416 times, while in Kunming it was 7,453 times, approximately three times higher than Chongqing.)

### New York Cotton Market Remains Firm

[Reuters, New York, 6th] The New York cotton market opened steady yesterday, with no initial fluctuations, then rose three points. Market conditions were calm, and new cotton was more stable. Industry demand for old cotton was met by several suppliers, causing a slight relaxation. The supply of new cotton was limited, trending slightly upward. The market closed steady, with old cotton down one to three points and new cotton up three to eight points.

### First Batch of Raw Silk Arrives in San Francisco

### A Brief Discussion on Works

— Xinghua

I remember a French writer once said: "A dull article passes through the ages like a mummy that will not decay, but other articles, full of flabby flesh and fat, and adorned with gorgeous rhetoric, will only have some crowns, rings, and ornaments dug from their tombs by later generations." Today, those great classical works are a steel-like testament. Therefore, we can also get an answer from this: works that are passed down through the ages not only rely on gorgeous rhetoric. At the same time, this is also the reason why many magnificent works are rejected by history.

When Emile Zola was publishing the history of the Rougon-Macquart family ("Les Rougon-Mac-quarl") in the newspapers, he suffered an unexpected blow (this can be said to be the inevitable experience of a writer who is faithful to a social era, and conversely, it is also a proof of the writer's success). There was even a low-quality critic who barked wildly: "Selling out the motherland! It's simply throwing the maggots on his own body into the pile of pure people." This should be a response to a work that delves into the core of society. At least, a group of 'pure people' in France should have discovered that their countrymen were already infested with maggots. In China, some writers are attacked precisely because they expose the decayed Chinese society without any cover.

Today's Soviet literature cannot be compared with the Tsarist era of Russia. Just read A. Tolstoy's essay, for example, "Soviet Literature in the Past Twenty-Five Years," which says, "...The spiritual category has played a decisive role in this war. Language is no longer just the coal burning in people's hearts. Language is like millions of bayonets charging into battle. Language has the power of artillery barrage."

If we use the above rules as a yardstick to evaluate the literary scene in Shanghai in the past, then I don't know what the result should be. I just want to (please note, just think!) Do we want to explore its results? (Even if we know the result will be so bad)

Modern Soviet writers have repeatedly proposed re-evaluating classical works. They frankly say that Dostoevsky's style of melancholy is already an old trace of the past era. This clearly and undoubtedly tells the truth about their progress. Conversely, can we say "Down with meaningless groaning and empty shouting"? -- The answer is still no. To be honest, in dozens of monotonous love novels, we still can't find a character as successful as the classical Lin Daiyu, although cunning writers dress them in fashionable cheongsams and apply lipstick recently imported from France. That is also to no avail.

It's very ridiculous (it's actually shameful!), among several of us young writers who specialize in writing about the conflict between revolution and love (?), they don't even understand what revolution is all about! As for a very smart term: dual personality, they always hang it on their lips, which are specially for sipping coffee, kissing, and drinking whiskey. Their interpretation is: to make a revolution and then fall in love.

Regarding examples, I don't want to give them either. It's really "everywhere you look."

### Beware

— Shi Jimei

New Year's Day, a morning like spring. We were walking on the street. Because all vehicles and pedestrians were changing to "keep to the right" from this day onward, everyone had a trace of caution at the beginning, so everything presented a slow mood.

I have always been afraid of the tense life in Shanghai. The vehicles that fly like shooting stars, the hurried passers-by, the busy people are busy, the not-busy people are also busy, the urgent things are urgent, the not-urgent things are also urgent, as if there is never a time to rest. If you want to rest, you can only stay at home.

Unexpectedly, in this way, for the sake of keeping to the right, the excessive tense air was adjusted. So we can walk freely on this street full of warm sunshine, watching the cars slowly drive by and the trams run leisurely.

I laughed. Careful Kailan said, "But I can't be as leisurely as you are. I always have to be careful."

"Beware, yes!" I said to her, "I'm not being uncautious. I believe I can remember it. Is it possible to make a special dress with a left-over garment for this?"

Kailan laughed and urged, "Of course, we can be careful ourselves, but can you beware of other people's carelessness?"

I paid close attention to her words and am willing to never forget them, because this should not only be remembered when I "walk on the stone side," but also when we run through the difficult journey of life, we should also be careful of this point.

### Zhu Yingpeng's Painting Exhibition

— Shi Chongpeng

It is so pleasant to visit Mr. Zhu Yingpeng's exhibition on the first New Year's Day after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War! Especially for those of us who study art. Mr. Zhu is a senior in the art world and also a veteran of the Chinese literary and art movement. He has made many contributions that deserve our admiration.

During the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Zhu lived in seclusion in Shanghai, firmly guarding himself, and using calligraphy and painting to pass the time. The works in this exhibition are his harvest over eight years. All the works are one hundred and fifty points, divided into five rooms, with figures accounting for about two-fifths, and landscapes, flowers and birds, etc. accounting for three-fifths. They integrate Chinese and Western painting into one, while fully maintaining the unique style of Chinese painting. The figure paintings are all portraits of national heroes of past dynasties, Guan Yu, Yue Wu Mu, Wen Tianxiang, Qi Jiguang, etc. This point is quite noteworthy. Mr. Zhu described the majesty of our nation at this time and place. The profound meaning and the great influence have unimaginable effects, and the lines of the clothes are smooth and lively, so-called "Cao Yi coming out of the water, Wu Dai blowing in the wind," this place can have both. As for the expression and demeanor, solemn and solemn, it is not limited by the small size of the painting. This is even more of Mr. Zhu's unique skill.

Among the landscape paintings, the most recommended are "Pine and Stone" and "Cyan and Green" and other works. The former is an imitation of Yunlin, a kind of elegant and simple atmosphere, overflowing on the paper. There is no smoke cloud rendering, but the smoke is full of the picture. This is not pleasing to the eye, I think it is commonly known by those in the know. The latter is a accumulated inch style page, mounted as a hanging scroll. The mountains are not too high, but dotted with small water pavilions, which makes the peaks appear towering. The water is not too deep, but interspersed with several rows of trees, which makes the autumn water appear long. The ancients said: "Within a foot, there is the power of a thousand miles." I see it in Mr. Zhu's works. Mr. Zhu said in the epilogue: "Li Sixun's cyan and green cannot avoid carving... Wang Shigu devoted himself to it for thirty years before he realized its method." Indeed, Mr. Zhu knows the traces of the transformation of cyan and green, no wonder he has such success.

This time, there are few flowers and birds, such as plum blossoms and daffodils. Although the style is small, the charm is not small. Mr. Zhu's feelings, the feelings during the Anti-Japanese War, are completely symbolized clearly in these flower and bird paintings. "Crane Cries in Jiugao" is especially outstanding, with the inscription: "I cherish my feathers and stand in the wind and dust, singing old-fashioned songs, the sound of which resounds throughout the world!" What a vast world! Finally, I feel that Chinese painting originally needs to be fully coordinated, with the three perfections of poetry, calligraphy and painting, and none can be missing. There are many inscriptions on each painting of Mr. Zhu's works. The handwriting is also delicate and vigorous, and the bookish atmosphere is very strong. He can be called a rare versatile painter in the contemporary era.

### On Reading Poetry and Reflections

— Lu Danlin

I happened to think of Lu Fangweng's poem: "A lone shadow of a new goose flying south, lodging in the deep cold clouds among the reeds; I don't know the Xiang River and Baling road, but remember if you've been to Yuyang and Shanggu!" This scene and feeling are like last night's cold moon and heavy frost, and in the air, I seem to hear the geese calling. Also, Fangweng's poem "Mourning Du Fu's Residence at Longxing Temple": "The Central Plains' plants and trees have lost peace, frontier fires and barbarian dust have reached the two capitals; the old minister follows the imperial carriage ten thousand miles, and comes here in his old age to listen to the river's sound." The first two lines have been true for the past seven or eight years, and the last two lines seem to be a portrayal of me leaning against the railing and looking at the Jialing River this morning. These were my thoughts last winter, and now when I think back, the fleeting moments seem like yesterday.

Liang Qichao inscribed on the Jiannan Poetry Collection: "For a thousand years, the poetry world has been filled with decadent winds, the spirit of the army has vanished, and the national spirit is empty; nineteen poems in the collection are about the joy of joining the army, an eternal man, Fangweng." Between the lines, he greatly praises Fangweng's poems. However, for over a thousand years, only mentioning Fangweng seems like pandering to his preferences while neglecting other poets. Cao Zijian's "White Horse Poem": "Charging into the Xiongnu, glancing to the left at the Xianbei; abandoning myself to the edge of the blade, how can I cherish my life? I do not care for my parents, let alone my children and wife. My name is written in the register of brave men, and I cannot harbor personal feelings; I sacrifice myself to the country's difficulties, and regard death as returning home!" It's full of generosity and excitement, and the words are heroic and magnificent. The lines "I do not care for my parents" and those following seem to be unprecedented among ancient poets. It is similar in tone to Ruan Sizong's "Expressing My Feelings" poem: "I cannot even protect myself, let alone love my wife and children!" However, Cao's poem is tragic and heroic, while Ruan's poem is desolate and poignant, making them somewhat different. Jia Sidao's poem: "Ten years I have honed my sword, its frosty edge has never been tested; today I hold it up for you, who has any grievances?" In the past ten years, what has been more unjust than the invasion and oppression of our entire nation by the Japanese pirates? The frosty edge should be tested on the invaders, and without asking, everyone agrees that it should be applied to the enemy. However, now that victory has arrived, we are not pursuing revenge, in accordance with our demeanor as a great nation. However, does Jia's poem only talk about "decadent winds?" Liang Qichao has a peculiar obsession and disregards other works, which is unfair.

"Iron horses cross the river, the wind breaks the flesh, cloud ladders attack the fort, and snow levels the trenches. Beasts scatter like birds, no need to pursue them, directly decapitate the Chanyu with a treasured saber." "The barbarian bowed his head and awaited heaven's doom, abandoning fields that are scattered across the battlefield. Quickly chase the fleeing horses in the snow, the official army enters Liaoyang in the middle of the night." These are two of the four poems in Fangweng's "Suddenly Inspired by the Desire to Join the Army in the Snow." This time, the central army "entered Liaoyang in the middle of the night" and recovered the three eastern provinces, reflecting this magnificent scene.

### Remembering Jiangnan

— Chen Gange

I wanted to send my feelings to the distant northern country, but not only can I not deliver my long-standing homesickness, but the recollection of endless past events only deepens it. I can only let the endless emotions be painfully and bleakly entrusted to the depths of my heart, to let it linger!

When I left this water village, it was the season of willows darkening and flowers brightening, and the hillsides were covered with peach blossoms, their slanting shadows entering the rippling lake. Do you think I'm forgetful? I can still tell you: A group of five or six-year-old siblings rushed into the small boat parked by the lake, swaying and drifting to the center of the river, using their tender white hands to pluck the newly bloomed lotus flowers; you were so anxious that you accidentally stepped into the rice field and rushed over to stop them. But the group of them, embracing the newborn flowers, went to the other side, and, from time to time, turned their heads to give you a hearty laugh!

I have long been thinking about Yunzao Creek, I wonder how it is now? There are dams built of large stones, and every summer, many nearby residents, naked, walk from the shore into the river, heading straight for the water tower in the river. The scorching sun makes the river water too warm, slapping on their bodies, scorching their skin purple. Looking from afar, ah, there are still a few floating shadows, chasing the silvery ribbon of the three-way stream. In the blink of an eye, it's spring again, and the ancient Longhua Temple in the setting sun stands among the multicolored peach blossoms, making it even more majestic and solemn! Perhaps it is much older now, but over the decades, it has witnessed countless human joys and sorrows, and staged many human dramas!

The scenery of Jiangnan, separated by eight long years, even if it is covered with impurities, someone will quickly wash away the dust for it; while the martyrs have since left their beautiful hometown. As for me, perhaps I will revisit the place full of peach blossoms, overlooking the lake; perhaps there is still a broken boat left there, but there will never be five or six-year-old siblings coming to play again. They are being baptized by the times, not only is every younger generation already graceful and upright, but they have all grown a calm heart, but their innocent childhood forms have since disappeared along with the martyrs, never to return!

Being in the distant northern country, seeing the high mountains and deep waters, blocking a peaceful lake and mountain scenery of Jiangnan, how can one not sigh? But the passing water flows, winter ends and spring comes again, and at that time, there will still be so many young men and women, interspersed between the red peaches and green willows; while the passes are still ten thousand miles of desert, desolate and uninhabited, how can it not increase the traveler's desire to return home? When I look in the mirror again, I will have added a few more wrinkles.

"Where is my childhood?"

### Following Mr. Chunqiu's Rhyme on the Seventeenth Day of December at Buqing Pavilion

### Corruption · Debauchery

— Xie Dongping

In today's world, is corruption limited to "officials" only? If we were to clear up the people's proper total income and their actual total expenditure, we would realize that many things have the suspicion of corruption.

Corruption cannot be forgiven. All corrupt "officials" should be severely punished, from imprisonment to execution. All corrupt "people" should also be fundamentally punished.

If we define legitimate income as: "the deserved reward obtained through labor (including physical and mental labor)," then all material obtained without labor or obtained through labor that exceeds what is deserved is illegitimate income. What is illegitimate income? It is actually corruption. Therefore, officials who accept bribes are corrupt, those who use their power for personal gain are corrupt, those who misuse seals for themselves or their friends during receiving are corrupt, clerical staff who take commissions are corrupt, and speculators, profiteers, and hoarders are all corrupt figures.

The root of corruption lies in extravagance and living beyond one's means, and the most fundamental reason is the existence of the private property system. We can inquire and ask, which of the contented laborers and honest farmers are corrupt? Corruption and luxury are inseparable. Anyone who lives luxuriously must be corrupt and must be corrupt. Therefore, when we oppose corruption, we must also oppose luxury.

A senior civil servant who earns less than ten thousand yuan a month can spend two hundred thousand yuan on one banquet, lose three hundred thousand or five hundred thousand yuan in one gambling session, dance the night away in a dance hall, and give away two or more diamond rings at a time to win the favor of a dancer. How can you say he is not corrupt? At the same time, it is very easy for us to investigate corruption. Anyone who lives extravagantly and acts generously is probably a corrupt person.

Raising the standard of living means raising it for everyone, not just raising it for a few people. The most fundamental way to eradicate corruption is naturally to start with reforming the social system. China does not want to create a capitalist society, so this reform is easy. Secondly, a more fundamental approach should also start from reforming social customs.

Eradicating corruption by only focusing on corruption itself has very little effect. Shanghai is now launching the New Life Movement again, emphasizing propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. How can corrupt people know shame? To realize the New Life Movement, we must eradicate all kinds of corruption before we can talk about "knowing shame" and the New Life Movement!

### Flying Together (1)

— Zhao Qingge

"The great waves of the era swept away the rotten dregs, and then rolled in the birth of a new century."

The Republic of China was established in the glory of this "new century"! Some of those "dregs" flowed downstream and disappeared, while others sank into the mud!

The dregs that sink into the mud are forever unclean, soaked in cold and dampness, but occasionally they are favored by the sun. Over time, the dregs can turn into essence!

After the "dregs turn into essence," they can no longer survive in the "mud." They need to go ashore and sublimate, but the earthworms and scorpions in the mud will surround them and drag them deeper! At the same time, the "shore" is so high and so far away; climbing up is not an easy task. Moreover, the magnificent shore walls often will not accept this product from the mud. Thus, it takes a lot of struggle for them to get from the mud to the shore, and they have to endure a lot of ruthless torment!

In this way, some of the essence is still buried in the mud! They cannot turn over; they cannot shine; their loss is the loss of the universe!

In the history of the world, the immortal things are successful essence refined from dregs. Similarly, in human history, the heroes and great men are successful essence refined from dregs. Just as gold is panned from sand.

Dregs can turn into essence, and natural essence, or carved essence, can also turn into dregs. Therefore, we should not despise dregs as waste; we should always pay attention to the fact that brilliant essence can also be refined from dregs; and after discovering it, we should nurture it well and cherish it. All evolution in the universe depends on this essence.

However, there is little space for essence, and there are not many immortal things in world history, nor many heroes and great men in human history; therefore, all evolution in the universe is also robbed very slowly.

Within thirty-five years, Chinese society, on the surface, is like a pool of filtered clean water; but in reality, countless residual poisonous bacteria of the old society have leaked down; they lurk in all strata of society; and multiply, spread; to produce a dark force; creating countless terrible evils - as a result, this pool of clear water is only a cosmetic facade; inside it is a complete mess; and gradually ripples of chaos are rippling, even affecting the tranquility of the "surface"!

Dregs are different from "bacteria." Dregs are a rejected, superfluous thing; while bacteria are a conspiratorial eroding force. Too much dregs will at most cause a feeling of disgust; unlike bacteria, which frighten you, they are enough to cause destruction and annihilation; they can poison a person's body; they can poison a social system; they can poison a country's policies; and they can poison the trend of the entire world.

I don't know how many people, societies, and countries have been sacrificed under "bacterial poisoning"; almost the entire world has been overthrown!

If you want the people to be happy; if you want society to be peaceful; if you want the country to be strong; if you want the world to be at peace; you can only eliminate bacteria and destroy bacteria.

Therefore, it is not enough for the great waves of the era to only sweep away the rotten dregs; we must completely filter out the toxic bacteria; in order to ensure that the birth of the new century is safe and healthy!

### To Prevent Banditry, "Civil Police Corps" Should Be Organized Quickly

— Junyi

Opening the newspaper, one can read news of robbery and kidnapping cases almost every day. During this winter defense period, the authorities are making every effort to consolidate public security in the city. Unfortunately, this bad result still occurs. For the safety of the city's five million people, how can one not be concerned! At present, the police stations seem to be working very hard on arrest work. We believe that instead of intensifying arrests after the fact, why not find a way to prevent problems before they occur? The responsibility for maintaining public security cannot be entirely pushed onto the police station. Given the vast area of Shanghai, the police force naturally feels insufficient. For their own safety, citizens should immediately bring out their own strength to organize a "Civil Police Corps."

During the enemy-puppet period in the past, there was a similar organization - the Self-Defense Corps, but due to the management system and the corruption of personnel, citizens have complained about it for several years. After the victory, it was soon eliminated. However, in fact, we cannot deny that this kind of strategy of using the police force of public groups to prevent bandits and undesirable elements from mixing and acting rashly is indeed the most effective countermeasure. As a result, it eventually makes them have nowhere to hide and disappear. The merit of the self-defense corps cannot be denied. Recently, the Baojia organization in this city has also been reorganized and perfected. As long as the bad system of the past is reformed and excellent personnel from the Baojia in each district are selected to be responsible for handling it, they can easily become familiar with it, which can save effort and achieve twice the result. The citizens only need to sacrifice some limited spirit and time to get the protection of life and property, then what is there to complain about!

The main reason for the rampant bandits, we still cannot blame on the increase in the number of unemployed and the soaring prices. As long as the factories start work quickly, the unemployed will have jobs, and the prices will fall, so that everyone can easily fill their stomachs. Why do these bandits have to take risks and engage in this life-threatening career! Therefore, to actively eradicate banditry, the authorities still need to solve these two problems.

### Adjusting the Treatment of Small Clerks, and Thoroughly Investigating the Aid to Enemy Aircraft

Mr. Editor: Since the war broke out, the most painful thing has been for us small clerks in companies who live on salaries. Usually, because we have no background or connections, no matter how hard we work, there are very few opportunities for salary increases. One month's income is often not enough to support a husband and wife. Taking the company where the writer works as an example, although the scale is quite large (the capital before the war had reached more than 11 million yuan), the treatment of small clerks is very meager. When the Pacific War broke out, the company implemented a non-public salary system, canceled the small clerk's subsidies (firewood, rice, oil, and cloth subsidies), and increased the salaries of a few special personnel. At the same time, those who participated in black market transactions were given special awards by the authorities during festivals. As a result, the small clerks became more and more suffering, and the special personnel became more and more prosperous. The most heartbreaking thing is that the company spent a lot of money to buy a machine and donate it to the enemy, and then specially prepared 400 boxes of gifts to give to the personnel who contacted the enemy army. According to the writer's investigation, the company's expenses this time are enough to pay the salaries of all the company's small clerks for more than 30 years with a surplus. The company's behavior is not only harsh to the small clerks, but also has the suspicion of aiding the enemy. I hope that the wise Social Affairs Bureau will find a way to correct it. Deng Liang
