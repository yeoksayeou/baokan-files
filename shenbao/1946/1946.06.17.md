[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 16th Dispatch] Military Mediation Department Government Committee Member Zheng Jiemin and General Bai Rude arrived in Beiping at 6:00 PM on the 16th after returning from Nanjing. After a brief stay in Beiping and discussions with the Executive Headquarters regarding increasing the Northeast Group, Bai Rude will fly to Shenyang and then to Changchun. The return of Government Committee Member Zheng Jiemin to Beiping indicates that the work of the Executive Headquarters is likely to become more active again.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] General Bai Rude, the American representative of the Changchun Forward Branch of the Beiping Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, flew to Beiping on the afternoon of the 16th, accompanied by Li Minran and Wang Shoudao, representatives of the CCP group. It is reported that Li Minran will immediately proceed to Shenyang to meet with Rao Shushi, the CCP representative of the Forward Branch, and then travel with Rao to Changchun to work. Li arrived in Nanjing on the 9th of this month from Yan'an on the same plane as Zhou Enlai and is a powerful figure among the CCP group representatives. His trip from Yan'an to Nanjing and then to Changchun is of utmost importance. Furthermore, according to General Bai Rude speaking to reporters before his departure, the appendix to the Northeast Armistice Mediation Agreement signed yesterday clearly states that the effective period of the armistice agreement will end at 12:00 noon on the 22nd of this month. With the deadline approaching, he will immediately convene a meeting of representatives from both sides after arriving in Changchun, and, following the established guidelines, groups (eight groups) will set out to begin mediation work, hoping that this short-term truce will successfully lead to a permanent cessation of hostilities.

[United Press, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] Although today is a Sunday holiday, Special Envoy Marshall still met and talked with Zhou Enlai in the evening.

### Restoration of Transportation Issue, Opinions of Both Sides Gradually Converging

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] After the signing of the Northeast Armistice Agreement, the restoration of transportation has become the focus of discussions today. It is understood that the opinions of both sides are gradually converging. Although the government has made significant concessions on the issue of demolishing blockhouses, the blockhouses that protect bridges and water towers, which are essential security facilities for road protection, should not be included in the demolition. As for railway management, this is a specialized technical issue, which is generally recognized by informed people here. In the future, for the sake of efficiency when repairing various sections, it would be most appropriate for the original railway employees to take over the management. In fact, the CCP also lacks many technical personnel to participate in management work. As for the railway transportation management personnel currently employed by the CCP in the communist-occupied areas, those whose knowledge is sufficient to perform their duties may be recommended by the CCP for continued employment by the transportation authorities. According to tonight's news, on the issue of restoring transportation, Marshall and our government share the same view that administrative integrity is essential and that personnel must be appropriately chosen. For the sake of complete transportation, the railway cannot be divided, and the appointment of personnel cannot be taken lightly. For example, the director of the railway administration appointed by the communist army east of Huomiao in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway was a porter, and this kind of personnel policy is not appropriate.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The head of the Transportation Management Section of the Beiping Military Mediation Department was said to have invited the responsible persons from both the government and the CCP to a banquet this noon to discuss the restoration of transportation, and continued discussions in the afternoon. According to those close to Marshall, the government has made the greatest concessions on the two issues of demolishing blockhouses and unified management. If the CCP does not make political demands regarding participation in management, an agreement is expected to be reached soon, and the repair work can begin to save the tens of millions of refugees north and south of the Yellow River.

### Chairman Chiang Strives for Peace, Convenes Staff Daily to Study Plans in Detail, Making Them Humane, Reasonable, Practical, and Effective

Spokesperson's Remarks from the Central Propaganda Department

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The spokesperson for the Central Propaganda Department, in response to reporters' inquiries about the peace talks, stated: "The government is making every effort to seek peace and has recently proposed various concrete plans, even down to the details. The CCP, however, often makes vague and ambiguous statements. Thanks to the hard work of Marshal Marshall and his staff, many plans have already gone beyond the drafting stage. The government's concessions and frankness have been demonstrated by facts, and we sincerely hope that the CCP will also show the same sincerity. Regarding the military situation, the CCP's recent propaganda is deeply saddening and infuriating. The communist army is launching a full-scale offensive along the Jinpu and Jiaoji railways in Shandong, occupying important cities, while the CCP's propaganda claims that it is acting in self-defense or retaliation. Asking why self-defense or retaliation necessitates occupying all the important towns along the two railways, or even invading the suburbs of Jinan and Qingdao. The important cities along these railways are known to all, both Chinese and foreign, to have been captured by the communist army after June 7th, and this has been witnessed by all. How can they brazenly distort the truth to this extent? Detailed information has been released by the Ministry of National Defense and will not be repeated here. Chairman Chiang has spared no effort in the peace talks, convening senior staff members daily to study concrete plans in detail, striving to make them humane, reasonable, practical, and effective. He has reached the extreme of tolerance regarding the CCP's delays, empty rhetoric, and even its military attacks that violate agreements, and he remains firm in his perseverance for the sake of the common good and the benefit of peace. However, the communist army is attacking and occupying cities and disturbing the peace everywhere, and the National Army cannot but engage in legitimate defense to protect the land and the people. This is the duty of the government and cannot be neglected. We sincerely hope that the CCP will earnestly reflect and not shirk the responsibility for undermining peace."

The Guangdong-Hankou Railway is currently being rushed to repair, and it is scheduled to be fully opened to traffic on July 1st. The Guangzhou-Kowloon line has been extended from Guangzhou to Foshan. Due to the extreme shortage of railway materials, the steel rails and sleepers of the Hangzhou-Ningbo and Nanjing-Wuhu railways are temporarily being dismantled and repaired.

### Pauley Inspects Northeast, Says China Should Receive More Compensation

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 16th Dispatch] U.S. Reparations Commissioner Pauley hosted Chinese and foreign reporters at noon on the 16th. After Chairman Zhang Jia'ao gave an introduction, Pauley stood up and spoke. Pauley said: "Among all the Allied countries, China should receive more compensation, because China has the most right to demand compensation. Today, the whole world needs food, clothing, and various technologies to restore a stable life, but only a few places can produce more materials and transport them to other places. One is the United States, and the other is the Northeast. The purpose of our visit to the Northeast is for this purpose. We are all concerned about the issue of compensation and also concerned about Japan's overseas assets. The assets left by Japan should be used as Japan's compensation for war losses to the Allied countries. China has the right to accept the main assets of the enemy countries within its borders. The United States has announced that Japanese assets in China and the Northeast should be left in their original locations, because the United States has a major responsibility in terms of compensation. The distribution plan for Japanese overseas assets should be determined based on the economic conditions of the countries entitled to demand compensation. Today's Northeast has an important position in the world, which is the main reason for our visit to the Northeast to investigate." Pauley continued: "Marshal Marshall is currently engaged in the difficult work of striving for peace in China, and we wish him a successful completion of his mission." A reporter asked Pauley about his impressions of the inspection of various factories in Shenyang. Pauley said: "We are only here to find the facts and do not want to make any conclusions." A reporter asked Pauley whether he would visit Changchun, Harbin, and other places for inspection. He said: He had requested to go to Harbin, Anshan, and Dalian. He also said that he had requested Marshal Marshall to assist him and to negotiate with the Communist Party to allow him to inspect the areas controlled by the Communist Party. Pauley said: "If we do not go to that area, our investigation cannot be considered complete."

[Further Dispatch] Pauley announced to reporters the inspection schedule as follows: In the afternoon of the 16th, he will continue to inspect the Shenyang Arsenal.

### Spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense Announces Facts of Communist China Violating the Agreement

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense, on the 15th, issued a statement saying: This Ministry issued a statement on the 11th of this month, revealing the situation of the Communist army violating orders after 12:00 noon on the 7th of this month by attacking the National Army. The purpose was to urge the Communist army to resolutely awaken, resolutely show sincerity, abide by the agreement, and quickly resolve pressing issues such as stopping the conflict, restoring transportation, and reorganization and unified compilation. However, judging from the widespread offensives launched by the Communist army in recent days, it is clear that they were pre-planned. They are no different from the Communist army's actions in violation of the agreement after the first ceasefire order was issued on January 10th of this year. Now, I will supplement the various situations from January 10th to June 7th of this year, in which the Communist army failed to comply with the agreement, violated the ceasefire order, expanded its army, moved troops without authorization, attacked and besieged cities and towns, attacked the National Army, destroyed transportation, detained and shot government and American representatives of the mediation and execution teams, so that the military and civilians of the country can jointly learn from them.

Until recently, the Communist army has expanded to two general headquarters (Northeast), fourteen army headquarters (five in the Northeast), forty-three division headquarters (nine in the Northeast), fifty-five military regions, eighty-one independent brigades (thirteen in the Northeast), and sixty-two independent regiments (excluding local teams in the Northeast and other places). Currently, the Communist army has formed the "Democratic Allied Army" in the Northeast, and in North China, it has formed eight field military regions such as "Ji-Re-Liao," "Jin-Sui," "Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu," "Jin-Ji-Cha," "Shandong," "Shaan-Gan-Ning," "Central China," and "Zhong-Zhu," as well as the "Democratic National Construction Army" and the "Democratic Second Allied Army." There are many names, and the total number of local teams and militias of the Communist army is now nearly 800,000.

(2) Moving Troops Without Authorization: Since the surrender of Japan until now, the Communist army has successively entered the Northeast from the provinces of Cha, Sui, Jin, and Ji via Rehe, totaling about 200,000 people. More than 80,000 people have entered the Northeast from Yantai, Longkou, and Weihaiwei in Shandong through various land and water routes. After the Northeast Execution Team arrived in Shenyang, the Communist army transferred more than 30,000 people from the border between Rehe and Ji, entering Liaoning and Chahar in the Northeast via the Qinglong River. The Communist army has repeatedly mobilized troops without authorization, attacking the National Army and attacking and besieging cities and towns, as can be seen from items (3) and (4) below.

(3) Attacking and Besieging Cities and Towns: The Communist army launched a full-scale offensive against the railway lines in North China, attempting to control the railways and cut off and surround the cities along the railways. From 1:00 AM on January 14th to May 20th, a.

(4) Attacking the National Army: The Communist army in various parts of North China launched a widespread offensive with planned actions. The Communist army in Rehe, with a force of 17 brigades, began to attack Pingquan, Beipiao, Chaoyang, and other places incessantly from May 13th. The Communist army in Shandong strengthened the blockade of Jinan from the beginning of May, actively deployed to besiege it, and had already occupied Mingshui, Longshan, Shilipu, and other places on the Jiaoji Railway.

### U.S. President Reports to Congress on the Implementation of the Lend-Lease Act, Reaffirms Non-Interference in China's Internal Affairs with Military Force

[U.S. News Agency, Washington, 14th] President Truman submitted a report to Congress on the implementation of the Lend-Lease Act on the 14th. According to the report, as of the end of 1945, the total amount of assistance provided by the United States to the Allied countries reached $50 billion. The total value of reverse lend-lease materials obtained by the United States from other countries was $7.346 billion. The report revealed that since the end of the war, the United States has continued to provide lend-lease assistance to China, which aims to help the Chinese drive out the remaining Japanese troops in China. The report stated that the United States transported four Chinese armies to the eastern provinces by plane, spending approximately $300 million. The United States also lent vehicles and munitions from the supplies of the U.S. Army in the Far East to China, so that China could recover the areas occupied by more than one million remaining Japanese troops after the war. The report pointed out that the post-war lend-lease assistance to China in support of General Marshall's mission to China is consistent with President Truman's announcement on December 15, 1945, of the U.S. policy. This policy is: "Continue to maintain regular and close cooperation with the National Government of the Republic of China to complete combat missions. In order to comply with the Potsdam Declaration and eliminate Japanese influence in China, the United States has assumed definite responsibility for disarming the Japanese army and sending them back to their country.

### Founding Anniversary of the Army Military Academy, President Chiang's Address, Overcoming All Difficulties to Complete the Mission of National Construction

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The grand meeting commemorating the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the Army Military Academy was solemnly held at the auditorium of the Ministry of National Defense at 5:00 PM on the 16th. The auditorium was simply decorated, with only large gold characters of the school motto "Fraternity, Sincerity, and Diligence" and "Promote the Huangpu Spirit" attached to the huge blue, white, and red cloth strips hanging on the four walls. More than 2,000 friends and colleagues of the military academy in Nanjing attended the meeting, including Li Jishen, Gu Zhutong, Bu Liz, Chen Lifu, Huang Jie, Tang 　, and Guan Hanqian. At 5:00 PM, President Chiang, accompanied by Minister Bai Chongxi, arrived at the meeting. The chairman wore a military uniform, adorned with the Order of Blue Sky and White Sun. Radiant, he walked into the auditorium to the sound of military music, and the entire audience stood in attention to welcome him. At the beginning of the meeting, the entire audience paid their highest respects to the president, bowed to the teachers, and silently mourned for the fallen and martyred classmates for one minute. President Chiang then delivered a speech, stating: Today is the 22nd anniversary of the founding of this school. In the past 22 years, every year on this day, the country has been in trouble. The students of our military academy have served on the frontiers, never knowing rest. This time, the eight-year war of resistance relied on the arduous struggle of all our comrades and the teachers and students of this school to achieve the final victory. However, the country is still unstable, and the people's suffering still needs to be relieved. Recalling the responsibility given to us by the founding father when he founded this school, I feel deeply moved. However, with the long history of this school, the large number of teachers and students, and their sincere belief in the ideology, I believe that we will be able to overcome all difficulties and complete our mission of revolutionary nation-building. I hope everyone will remember the school motto given by the founding father when he founded the school: "Believe in the ideology and be the vanguard of the people," "One heart and one mind, from beginning to end." This principal takes this as a self-encouragement and also encourages all the teachers and students of our school. Then General Li Jishen gave a speech, stating that the work of nation-building is still arduous after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The founding father's last words "Revolutionary party members must aspire to do great things." I hope our students will follow the past revolutionary spirit, sacrifice and struggle, seek welfare for the people, and take on the responsibility of nation-building. Then He Zhong 　 delivered a reply on behalf of the students, saying that listening to the president's earnest instructions today has made me want to strive unceasingly. Recalling that the founding father taught us to establish lofty ideals, seek profound knowledge, sacrifice and struggle, and implement ideology, our students swear to abide by the founding father's teachings with utmost sincerity, earnestly implement the president's instructions, protect the fruits of the revolution, and complete the mission of nation-building. President Chiang then led everyone to recite the party members' code of conduct and the soldiers' reading instructions. After finishing, he explained that both of these were drafted by me and are weapons for victory. I personally practice them and use them to encourage myself. He also encouraged everyone to implement them together to complete the National Revolution. His words were heartfelt and inspiring. Afterwards, the entire audience shouted slogans such as "Unified Will" and "United Spirit," and the emotions were extremely enthusiastic. President Chiang also took a group photo with all the teachers and students as a memento. At 6:30 PM, they had a dinner party, joyful as a family. At 7:30 PM, the China Film Studio screened a film to help.

[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 16th] Today is the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the military academy.

After the parade held at 8:00 AM, Director Zhang first read the president's address, and then delivered a speech, stating that the 22-year-old military academy has largely completed the achievements of the Chinese revolution and the War of Resistance. In the future, it should further promote the Huangpu spirit and complete the new China of unified Zhang Sheng. Deng Xihou and others delivered speeches to encourage the students. The ceremony was completed at noon.

### Shen Honglie Talks About Land Tax Collection in Kind, Land and Grain Office Restores Old System and Becomes Subordinate to the Provincial Government, Zhejiang Provincial Administrative Conference to be Held in Mid-July

[This newspaper, Hangzhou, 16th] Zhejiang Provincial Chairman Shen received a reporter from this newspaper alone on the 16th during a regular holiday. He said that he attended the financial revenue and expenditure system meeting in Jinjing this time. Regarding the collection of food and land tax in kind in Zhejiang Province, after discussion, the original tax amount was one yuan, and three dou of grain, one dou and five sheng for borrowing, and one dou for provincial and county public grain, totaling five dou and five sheng, which would not exceed the previous standard for collection in kind. As for the collection agency, the Land and Grain Office will restore the old system and become subordinate to the provincial government. Each county will set up a Land and Grain Office or Land and Grain Section. The province will make practical adjustments with reference to actual needs, and the overall goal is to streamline. The necessary expenses for the second half of this year will still be borne by the central government. After the sea dikes are urgently repaired, there will be no major problems with the autumn floods this year. However, this is only an emergency measure, so permanent construction must be planned, and work has already begun. The Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway leading to Hai　 is badly damaged and needs to be repaired urgently. He has already worked out a solution with the Zhejiang-Fujian branch of the Administrative Yuan and the person in charge of the Ministry of Communications in Zhejiang. The technicians of the Ministry of Communications will cooperate with the existing materials of the Administrative Yuan and the construction will begin soon. The Zhejiang Provincial Information Office will be established soon. From this week onwards, I will read official documents from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM, call civil servants for talks from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and inspect various places in the city in the afternoon, first the administrative organs and schools, and then the business organs and factories. It is expected to be completed in half a month. A provincial administrative meeting will be held on July 15, so the trip to Ning Shao must be after late July. The distribution of public grain to civil servants in Zhejiang Province has continued. In short, everything is waiting to be done after the war, and it is often planned slowly according to urgency.

### Financial Situation Stable in Beijing and Tianjin Last Week

[This newspaper, Beiping, 16th] The financial situation in Beijing and Tianjin this week has not fluctuated greatly.

Tianjin stocks continued to weaken, with Qixin at 25,60 yuan. On Friday, gold and the US dollar were weak, mainly due to tight money and the influence of Shanghai's refusal to accept speculation.

### Passengers Inspected at Suzhou Station, Bandits Fired in Desperation

Deaf-Mute Man Dies from Four Gunshot Wounds

[Our Suzhou Dispatch] The Shanghai-Nanjing express train, delayed, arrived in Suzhou at 10:15 PM on the 13th of this month. As passengers entered Pingmen Gate, the garrison implemented an inspection. Unexpectedly, about five bandits, each in a rickshaw, entered the city. As the first rickshaw was about to be inspected, the bandit jumped out of the rickshaw, drew a pistol, and fired two shots. The other four bandits outside the city dismounted, turned around, and fled towards the Suzhou-Changzhou highway, also firing their guns. The Pingmen Road warehouse garrison troops immediately formed an encirclement. The situation was very tense at the time, with dozens of shots fired in rapid succession. At that time, Li Hongyun (28 years old), the deaf-mute son of former police bureau section chief Li Chushi, lived at No. 20 Shipin Lane. He was of a simple nature and hard of hearing. He happened to be passing the intersection of Pingmen Road and Baoyu Road. Seeing the situation, he ran forward to escape. The pursuing soldiers shouted for him to stop, but Li did not hear them, causing the soldiers to open fire. He was shot four times. One bullet hit the tiger's mouth of his right hand, shattering it, one bullet each struck his left and right waist and abdomen, and one bullet hit the upper part of his right thigh. On the morning of the 14th, his wife, Ms. Wang, identified the body and requested the district procurator's office to waive autopsy. Li Hongyun's corpse was wearing a faded white homespun short shirt and trousers, with a sweat undershirt and short trousers underneath, barefoot with cloth shoes on. Blood covered the ground. After a night of heavy rain, it was almost completely washed away. His hands and feet were swollen, his mouth and eyes were open, and his appearance was terrifying. His wife has moved the body to the funeral home outside Qimen Gate and plans to prepare a coffin for burial on the 15th.

Wuxi Preparing to Establish a Isolation Hospital for Epidemics

Based on what is known in the vicinity of the city alone, dozens of people are being infected every day and seeking treatment at various hospitals.

At the Party, Government, Military, and Civic Groups conference on the 14th, it was resolved to establish an isolation hospital to accommodate epidemic patients. However, due to the vast expense involved and the difficulty of raising funds, it was decided to send a letter to the Victory Grand Theater to add a two-hundred yuan epidemic prevention fee to each ticket.

### Editorial: The Prospects for the Reopening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference

The foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France reopened their conference in Paris the day before yesterday with a pleasant mood, which relieved the people around the world who hope for peace. All parties attach great importance to this conference, believing it to be a major key to whether Britain and the United States can cooperate with the Soviet Union. In particular, when US Secretary of State Byrnes flew to Paris, President Truman sent him to the airfield, which was unprecedented in American political history, showing the importance that the US government attaches to Byrnes' trip. Looking at the surrounding international environment, it is even more felt that this foreign ministers' conference is one that "can only succeed and cannot fail." If this foreign ministers' conference fails again, the future of the international political situation will be unimaginable! We were very excited to hear the news the day before yesterday that the representatives shook hands warmly with each other, and we deeply hope that there will be no more long nights and many dreams, and that happiness will not turn into disappointment again.

The last foreign ministers' conference ended unhappily. Although only a month has passed since its reopening, the relationship between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union seemed to have not only not improved in the past few days, with no words of reconciliation, but had deteriorated further, with the two sides becoming increasingly estranged. For example, on the American side: (1) it seems unwilling to lend money to Poland; (2) it protested the situation in Romania; (3) it intervened in the case of former Yugoslav Army General Mihailović being accused; (4) German merchant ship fleets traveling on the Danube were detained by the US military; (5) according to the Potsdam Agreement, which stipulates that Germany should use certain industrial equipment as compensation, the US military authorities ordered the cessation of transportation. All of this, in the eyes of the Soviet Union, is nothing short of a thorn in its side, and the Soviet Union itself has also taken many unfriendly actions! (1) It has strengthened its close relationship with all countries within its sphere of influence, as evidenced by the signing of the Soviet-Polish treaty; (2) Yugoslav leader General Tito recently visited Moscow again; (3) Denmark also has a tendency to develop foreign trade to the east; (4) Recently, Soviet troops have moved from Austria to Germany; (5) The Soviet Union, Poland, and Yugoslavia did not participate in the victory parade held in Britain. In the eyes of Britain and the United States, these events also made them feel that the Soviet Union's policy of outward expansion is endless. In this month, mutual accusations between the two sides have intensified. Although their spokespersons are diplomats who understand international etiquette, they have also been very frank and straightforward in their mutual recriminations, throwing all diplomatic rhetoric to the winds. In addition, the results of the general elections in France and Italy have shown that the power of the Catholic Party is expanding in Western European countries. The "Western European Group," which has attracted worldwide attention, seems to be moving from the stage of brewing to the stage of maturity. These are all trends of "division," which will inevitably have some adverse effects on the foreign ministers' conference that seeks "unity."

On the day the foreign ministers' conference reopened, the entire agenda was discussed. It was decided that the peace treaties with Italy, Finland, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary, as well as the German question, would all be included in the agenda. However, on the Austrian question and the internal situation in Italy, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union had different opinions. Fortunately, French Foreign Minister Bidault's mediation led to a compromise, which was that the Austrian question would be discussed in general at the end of the foreign ministers' conference, and then the internal political situation in Italy would be discussed. However, if major changes occur in the Italian situation, they can also be discussed in advance. The depth of the mutual prejudices and the firmness of the attitudes of both sides can also be seen. From this perspective, the future of the four-power foreign ministers' conference still does not allow for excessive optimism. However, in terms of the current international situation, no matter from which aspect, people hope for "unity" and do not want to see "division." The "division" and "unity" of the world are tied to this meeting, but if it really evolves into "division," humanity will be no different from seeking its own destruction! However, how can Britain and the United States be made to cooperate fully with the Soviet Union? And how can Europe be prevented from splitting into two blocs, East and West? How can the world be prevented from splitting into two and allowing humanity to clash with each other using atomic bombs and other weapons?

When Molotov announced the Soviet Union's foreign policy to a Pravda reporter and responded to Byrnes's condemnation, he accused the United States of adopting a policy of power politics and threatening the Soviet Union with its "atomic diplomacy." From this, it can be seen that the crux of the inability of the United States and the Soviet Union to cooperate still lies in the fact that the United States is unwilling to disclose the secrets of atomic energy, which makes the Soviet Union feel "uneasy." It has no choice but to expand its "circle of friends" to seek what it considers to be reliable security. However, if the atomic energy issue is not resolved, the Soviet Union's suspicion of the United States seems impossible to eliminate.

According to a New York dispatch yesterday, the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission held a meeting, and US representative Baruch put forward a very important proposal, advocating that atomic energy be handed over to international institutions for control, and declaring on behalf of the United States that if an international atomic energy agency can be established, it is willing to hand over all atomic bombs for destruction and no longer manufacture them. British atomic energy experts also held a meeting in Birmingham and expressed their support for the US proposal, hoping that the international control of atomic energy will be realized as soon as possible. After this spring breeze blows to Paris, it should be able to make the foreign ministers' conference, which is full of suspicion and doubt, suddenly show a scene of peace and light. "When the mountains and rivers are exhausted, one doubts that there is no road, but the willows are dark and the flowers are bright, and another village appears!" We hope that the four powers can seize the opportunity and discuss with sincerity, so that the hostility will disappear completely and peace will be assured. We especially put forward a wish, which is: since the United States is willing to hand over atomic energy to international institutions for careful control, to eliminate mutual suspicions and fears, the Soviet Union can also stop haggling over the expansion of "safe zones" in a small area, and join the twenty-five-year alliance to jointly prevent the resurgence of Germany and Japan. Everyone should know that peace is indivisible, and only the collective security of the United Nations, and only the overall security of the world, is everyone's true security. If this can be the case, then even if there are disputes in the four-power foreign ministers' conference, they can all be easily resolved. Therefore, the United States' disclosure of the secrets of atomic energy and the Soviet Union's abandonment of its narrow concept of "safe zones" are the preconditions for the success of the four-power foreign ministers' conference, while drafting peace treaties with the enemy and so on are smaller, secondary issues.

### Foreign Ministers' Conference Adjourned Yesterday; Atmosphere of First Meeting Harmonious; Austrian Question Included in Agenda

[Our Dispatch] London, 16th Broadcasting: The four-power foreign ministers did not hold a meeting in Paris today, but were busy preparing to participate in tomorrow's meeting. The foreign ministers held informal talks on the issues of Italy and Austria.

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 16th Broadcasting: Moscow reports that the Danube issue was discussed at yesterday's foreign ministers' conference. The Soviet representative believed that Britain's interests in the Danube were no greater than those of other Danube countries, and that this issue should be handled by the Danube countries without external interference.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 15th] At this meeting, Byrnes, Bevin, Bidault, and Molotov all attended today's foreign ministers' conference with a friendly and optimistic attitude. When the representatives entered the venue, they were flanked by attendants and advisors, and shook hands warmly with each other. Electrical lights flashed around them, and photographers took various photos in a short period of time. (According to news from the French Embassy in Washington, French Ambassador Bonnet has been ordered to return home to participate in the meeting and assist the French delegation.)

### Course of First Meeting

[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] The four foreign ministers held a meeting at 3:00 PM today (Greenwich Mean Time). First, French Foreign Minister Bidault delivered a welcoming speech, hoping that this beneficial work could be completed with a meeting full of cooperative spirit. He then thanked the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the foreign ministers of each country also thanked him.

US Assistant Secretary of State Dunn presented a report drafted by the four foreign deputy ministers in Paris for discussion.

Regarding the agenda, the four foreign ministers decided to include all the issues listed on the agenda of the previous meeting in the agenda of this meeting, namely, the peace treaties with Italy, Finland, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary, and the German question. As for the Austrian question and the internal situation in Italy, it is planned to leave them for discussion at the end of the meeting. US Secretary of State Byrnes proposed that the Austrian peace treaty issue should also be included, but Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov raised several objections, stating that the agenda already included a large number of items and that it was not necessary to add this issue. French Foreign Minister Bidault came forward to mediate and suggested a compromise, which was that the Austrian peace treaty issue did not need to be included in the agenda, but that a general discussion on this issue should be held at the end of the meeting. At this point, Molotov proposed that the internal situation in Italy should also be discussed, on the grounds that according to the armistice agreement of 1943, the Allied countries had guaranteed that all remnants of fascism must be eradicated, and that according to the protocol of May 16, 1946, the Allied countries also had the right to monitor the development of Italian internal affairs. Recently, disturbances have occurred in that country, and the remnants of fascism and neo-fascists have been active everywhere, and their future consequences are very concerning. After a long discussion, agreement was reached, deciding that the Austrian problem would be put forward for discussion first. After the meeting was declared to be over, the problem of Italian domestic politics will be discussed again, but if major changes occur in the Italian political situation, the four foreign ministers may also discuss them in advance. Regarding the Italian economic issue, Molotov also proposed that it be submitted for discussion, and requested the Italian government to submit its views on the economic terms of the future treaty. British Foreign Minister Bevin immediately raised an objection, stating that it would not be logical to solicit intentions before the twenty-one-nation peace conference had been convened. Molotov replied that the opinions of the Italian government had already been solicited when the boundary issue was discussed at the last foreign ministers' conference, and that there was already a precedent for this. But Molotov also withdrew the above proposal, and the four-power foreign ministers' conference adjourned at 5:40 PM and continued at 3:00 PM on the 17th of this month.

### New Armistice Agreement with Italy: British and American Terms Differ

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 15th] It has been learned that the United States has sent the full text of the new armistice agreement, including the American financial terms, to the Italian government for study. Britain has also sent the full text of the new armistice agreement to Rome. The difference between the two agreements lies in the financial terms.

### Report of the International Committee on European Problems: Germany Still Possesses the Ability to Wage War

Plan to Prevent Nazis from Revival Submitted to Foreign Ministers' Conference; Suggests that the Ruhr Area be Entrusted to the UN Security Council for 30 Years

[Reuters, London, 13th] The International Committee for the Study of European Problems issued a report today stating that Germany's ability to wage war is still higher than that of its neighbors in 1938. Under the current Allied control system, it is feared that there is no possibility of weakening it. It is reported that its conclusions are based on all Allied official documents and documents discovered after the German surrender. The report said that since March 28, 1945, Hitler, upon the advice of his Minister of Armaments, Speer, changed his original intention to completely destroy Germany after the defeat. Speer believed that Germany would eventually have fully equipped industry and manpower even under Allied occupation in order to fight again. We now examine the population and industrial figures of Germany, as well as the power of Nazi ideas, and deeply believe that Speer's words are indeed reasonable. In its current state, there is still no sign of ending for a while. The committee has drafted a plan to prevent the revival of the Nazis and submitted it to the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference. Among those who may draw the attention of the Foreign Ministers' Conference starting tomorrow is the suggestion that the Ruhr area be entrusted to the United Nations Security Council for twenty years and that the Ruhr area be governed and controlled by a trustee committee composed of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain, the United States, and other countries. As for the four governments, the Allied Control Committee in Berlin and the Security Council are actually ultimately responsible for the Ruhr. The plan supports the British proposal to establish a German federation. After thirty years, if the United Nations agency believes that Germany has reached a level where it can be re-educated, then the Ruhr can be gradually returned to Germany. The suggestion pointed out that the Nazis killed 15 million people from other countries, while the population of their country increased by 7.5 percent after World War I, which is also a dangerous situation. Therefore, it is hoped that United Nations agencies can supervise the population policies of various countries in the world. For example, in countries with sparse populations such as France and Australia, they should be encouraged to reproduce, while countries with dense populations such as Germany and Japan should be restricted.

[United Press International, Washington, 15th] The State Department announced that President Truman today submitted a bill to Congress advocating the unification of the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force under a Department of Defense. The entire plan consists of twelve points, incorporating the opinions of the Army and Navy departments, as well as the President's arbitration methods for key points on which agreement could not be reached.

These three Secretaries will not be in the Cabinet, and the Army, Navy, and Air Force will be equal as two-in-one entities, each managing its internal administration. (The Army Department has also endorsed this agreement, but the Navy Department has requested preservation of its autonomy and Cabinet status).

(3) The Air Force shall be responsible for developing, acquiring, maintaining, and using U.S. military aviation resources, but naval aircraft and seaplanes shall remain under naval control.

(4) Preserve the Marine Corps as part of the Navy.

(7) The Joint Chiefs of Staff shall assume responsibility for strategy and calculations, similar to the current staff agencies.

(8) Do not appoint a single Chief of Staff.

(9) An intelligence agency, under the National Defense Council, shall analyze and estimate intelligence collected by various government agencies (including military).

(10) Joint planning and coordination, disposition, production, and distribution, in order to avoid "wasteful competition."

(11) Research agencies shall coordinate scientific research and military development.

(12) Military education and training shall periodically review and adjust the system for educating and training military personnel to form a unified plan.

### Intense Debate Between British, American, and Soviet Representatives at the United Nations Social and Economic Committee Session

Soviet Union Claims Refugee Issue Has Political Significance

[United Press International, New York, 15th] At today's meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, British, American, and Soviet representatives engaged in a heated debate. Soviet Representative Fyodorov argued that the issue of displaced persons and refugees now has political significance, and that the United Kingdom and the United States do not wish to make certain facts public. Fyodorov resolutely opposed Yugoslavia's request to investigate European refugee camps. British Representative McNeil directly addressed the Soviet Representative, stating: "Mr. Fyodorov, you know that there is an existing arrangement to investigate refugee camps. The suffering and poverty of refugees must be subject to police investigation." U.S. Representative Winant also replied to Fyodorov, stating that the United States has never used the plight of refugees for political motives, and that various concentration camps in the U.S. occupation zone have been the target of investigations by other countries. Previously, the Yugoslav representative requested the dispatch of a United Nations commission to conduct on-site investigations of various refugee camps, claiming that the camps harbor rebels and train deserters from the Yugoslav army. After the Belgian representative spoke, Fyodorov stated: "I do not know why investigating these camps would be dangerous. Certain parties are concealing certain facts and do not want the truth to come out."

### Director of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Suggests Establishing an International Planning Bureau to Regulate World Food Supplies

Orr believes that international cooperation to relieve famine is as important as controlling atomic energy

[United Press International, Washington, 15th] Secretary of Agriculture Anderson stated in a broadcast tonight that the United States does not need to restore rationing in order to rescue starving people worldwide. The Director of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, Orr, said that if major producing countries can continue to implement wartime controls, famine can be avoided. Anderson also agreed with him. The world food situation will remain precarious until at least the autumn harvest of 1947. If they want to restore normal production, they must look forward to a few years. Orr proposed establishing an International Food Planning Bureau to allow countries with surpluses or deficiencies to be regulated. The solution to the food problem is almost as important to world peace as managing atomic energy. Therefore, a far-sighted International Food Planning Bureau should be established to eliminate famine around the world.

### To Prevent the Grand Mufti from Sneaking into the Middle East, the British Navy Conducts a Large-Scale Search - Rumors that He has been Taken by a British Ship to the Chagos Islands

[Reuters, London, 15th] Since the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Husseini, left Paris, the authorities have ordered all regions to prevent him from sneaking into the Middle East. A cable from Cairo today stated that the British transport ship "Teviotbank" was searched by a British destroyer outside Port Said.

[Reuters, Port Said, 15th] The British Navy Department announced that after inspecting the transport ship "Teviotbank" outside Port Said yesterday, it has not dispelled the belief among people here that the Grand Mufti is in the hands of the British authorities. Everyone believes that after the destroyer "Virago" inspected "Teviotbank," it sailed to the Suez Canal and has taken the Grand Mufti to the world-famous exile site, the Seychelles Islands. The mystery of how the Grand Mufti boarded the transport ship "Teviotbank" (if this is indeed the case) has not yet been resolved.

It is claimed that "No one in Canada knows how the United States manufactures atomic bombs. No one asked the United States to provide information. I dare to believe that even if someone asks for this information, it will not be provided unless there is a major need. I believe that after Canada discovers the need to establish a control bureau, it will be able to manufacture atomic bombs itself."

### Major Grain Loan Embezzlement Case - District Attorney's Office to Investigate Today

Concurrently Commander Xuan Tiewu Solemnly States "Will Never Show Favoritism with the Law"

[This Newspaper Report] Wang Daren, a specialist commissioner of the Grain Administration Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Food in Shanghai, and concurrently acting director, was transferred to the Songhu Garrison Command Military Law Office for temporary detention at approximately 2:00 PM on the 15th, after being summoned for questioning on the afternoon of the 14th. It is reported that Wang was summoned at his private residence at approximately 7:00 PM on the afternoon of the 14th. Immediately afterwards, the interrogation personnel went to the Grain Administration Office to retrieve the relevant grain loan case files. The Shanghai District Court Inspection has scheduled a preliminary hearing for 10:00 AM today, summoning Yang Xizhi, Wang Daren, Ren Xingya, and Li Chongnian, four grain officials, as well as the persons in charge of the rice merchants involved in the grain loans. However, Yang Xizhi is currently still in the United States and has not returned, and there have been no reports of Ren and Li coming to Shanghai for questioning. It is still unknown whether they will be able to appear in court as summoned at that time. The Garrison Command Military Law Office has also decided to summon the persons in charge of the fourteen grain loan rice merchants separately starting today.

It is also reported that concurrently Commander Xuan declared yesterday that some of the main perpetrators in the grain loan embezzlement case will be subject to severe military law sanctions. Xuan explained that non-military criminals should originally be tried by ordinary judicial organs, but the circumstances of this case are serious and cannot be constrained by ordinary law, so he has been ordered to implement military law trials for a portion of the perpetrators in this case. Xuan refused to announce the names of those who should be subject to military law trials in this case, but he solemnly stated that all those with serious criminal suspicions will be strictly investigated and dealt with, and will not show favoritism due to their "special" backgrounds or identities. He repeatedly stated, "Will never show favoritism with the law."

### Wang Yunwu Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday from Beijing - Received Representatives of Rear Area Factories

Discussing Plans to Resume Work in Enemy and Puppet Factories

Representatives of rear area factories Xie Dasha, Ye Zhu, Hu Yunfu, Wo Shuyan, Chen Baiquan, etc., noting the increasing number of workers arriving in Shanghai, the lack of work, and the failure to resume factory operations, prepared two plans for the resumption of work in the hundred or so enemy and puppet factories that are still closed down, and sent them to Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu. Yesterday, after Minister Wang arrived in Shanghai from Beijing, he immediately summoned representatives Xie Dasha and others to his private residence. In addition to expressing his condolences and encouragement for the contributions of the various factories during the War of Resistance, and urging them to continue to work hard to build the national industry in the future, he also discussed the plans in detail. According to the plans, there are two categories: joint operation and agency operation. The joint operation method has been widely implemented in enemy and puppet factories in the Guangzhou area. It uses the original factory buildings, machinery, etc., with public shares. The people raise raw materials, workers, and working capital to become a special joint-stock company. The agency operation also adopts the company method, but the share capital is temporarily wholly owned by the government, and gradually sold to private factories to avoid reducing efficiency due to institutionalization and enable rapid commencement of work. If either of the above methods is adopted by the authorities, the hundred or so enemy and puppet factories that have been closed for nine months can gradually resume work, accommodating more than ten thousand workers. In a negative sense, it can also reduce the monthly unemployment worker relief fund of tens of millions of yuan.

[This Newspaper Report] The Shanghai Branch of the National Assembly Representatives Friendship Association, as well as representatives from various circles, held a tea party at the International Hotel on the second floor yesterday afternoon to entertain Yi Xibo Zhen and other eight Tibetan National Assembly representatives.

### Whether or Not to Hold a Production Conference is Undetermined

The production conference that the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has approved to convene was originally scheduled to be held at the end of this month. Yesterday, according to the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Mr. Wu Kaixian, told reporters: Earlier reports stated that Minister of Economic Affairs Wang will convene a National Economic Conference in Beijing. The content of the discussions at these two conferences is roughly similar, and the people invited to participate from various circles are also roughly similar. Therefore, if the Economic Conference can be convened in the near future, it would be uneconomical to convene two conferences with similar natures within a month. Therefore, Mr. Wu telegraphed Minister Wang yesterday to inquire about his opinion. If the National Economic Conference can be convened, then the Production Conference will not be held, and the collected reference materials will be forwarded to the National Economic Conference for reference. If the Economic Conference is not convened immediately, then the Production Conference will still be held at the end of this month. The people invited to participate include 200 to 300 people from the economic, industrial, commercial, and banking sectors.

### Yuan Meiyun's Appeal Rejected

[Our Newspaper] Movie star Yuan Meiyun was sentenced to imprisonment for opium use. Yuan, dissatisfied, appealed to the High Court. It is now learned that the appeal has been rejected, but if a forensic doctor can prove that Yuan is indeed free of symptoms, she can be released. According to Yuan's people, she had already quit before being arrested and only used medicinal water for stomach problems. Having been in prison for a long time, no signs of illness have been seen. Judging from common sense, it is thought that she no longer has an addiction, so Yuan can be expected to be released soon. However, Yuan's reputation has been greatly damaged by this case.

### Japanese Man Marries Chinese Woman Under a False Name, Lived in the Countryside and Recently Came to Shanghai, Takahashi Yoshiki's Suspicious Behavior Leads to Arrest on Suspicion of Espionage

The bureau's chief, Zhang Rou, led police officers to arrest both the man and woman the night before last. The Japanese man is suspected of espionage and has been transferred to the General Bureau for interrogation.

### Situ Meitang Talks About His Impressions of Returning to China, Living in America is Five to Six Times Cheaper Than Shanghai, Remittances from Overseas Chinese are Not Enough to Solve the Problem

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, this reporter visited Situ Meitang, an 80-year-old leader of overseas Chinese and a senator who lived in the United States for sixty years and recently came to Shanghai. He is very energetic and healthy. He told us that his deepest impression of returning to China is that the cost of living in Shanghai is too high, making it difficult for ordinary people to maintain their livelihoods. In the past, during the concession era, attention was paid to public health. He hopes that the Municipal Bureau of Public Works and the Health Bureau will continue their efforts. The current cost of living in the United States is on average five to six times lower than in Shanghai, while the wages earned by American workers are actually higher than those earned by Chinese workers in the past. In terms of transportation costs, it is even more expensive in China than in the United States, making people's lives inevitably difficult. The most important thing now is for all parties and factions to cooperate sincerely, stop the civil war, and seek peace as soon as possible, for the welfare of the nation, so that a new China can be built soon. After eight years of hard fighting, China is no longer afraid of being divided by the great powers, but what is most terrifying is that the Chinese themselves want to divide China! This makes overseas Chinese extremely worried. Currently, the American business community and some overseas Chinese, in view of the current civil war situation in China, although they have the intention to invest, they hesitate to move forward, because there is no sufficient guarantee in this situation.

Unbearable Memories of the Past

I went to the United States more than sixty years ago, still wearing a queue (braid), and suffered much humiliation. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the treatment of overseas Chinese improved slightly. During the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, Americans greatly admired China's perseverance and unwavering resistance, and their respect for overseas Chinese increased. In order to assist the war, I presided over the "Fundraising Association" in the United States, and Americans also donated enthusiastically. What was most heartbreaking during the war was the matter of remittances from overseas Chinese. When overseas Chinese remitted money from the United States back to China, five US dollars were only worth 100 legal tender yuan. Later, although it increased to one US dollar for 500 legal tender yuan, in reality, if exchanged at foreign banks, the price could be one US dollar for more than six yuan in national currency. Overseas Chinese suffered a great loss. After the money was handed over to the five-nation banks, the remittances to Taishan, Xinhui, Kaiping, and other places took several years to arrive. Relatives of overseas Chinese starved to death due to the interruption of aid, which made overseas Chinese want to cry but have no tears!

Reviving the Hongmen, Seeking Joint Development

This time, I returned to China not only to see the victory but also to strengthen the Hongmen. I am the chairman of the Hongmen Zhi Gong Party headquarters. Most of the overseas Chinese in the United States are Hongmen brothers. In the past, the Hongmen made great contributions to the nation and the country, sacrificing countless lives and spending countless money to help achieve the miraculous success of the Xinhai Revolution. After the establishment of the Republic of China, they retired after their success and no longer participated in national affairs. Unexpectedly, the country has reached such a state of hardship for the people! This time, reviving the Hongmen is to unite the brothers and jointly shoulder the heavy responsibility of construction, increase production capacity, and enable people to live and work in peace. However, the prerequisite for living and working in peace is to ensure that everyone has adequate clothing, food, and housing. If the problem of livelihood can be solved, it will be easier to get on the right track. Mr. Situ's name is Xian, and his courtesy name is Meitang. He is from Kaiping, Guangdong. He went to San Francisco at the age of fourteen and joined the Hongmen Zhi Gong Tang at the age of seventeen. He is selfless and righteous and highly respected by overseas Chinese in the United States. In his early years, he supported Sun Yat-sen and opposed Chen Jiongming, making great contributions. After the War of Resistance against Japan, he presided over the Fundraising Association, continuously supplying the motherland, achieving the best results among overseas Chinese. In the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942), he was commissioned by the government to comfort overseas Chinese in the United States, and was warmly welcomed. Recently, he returned to China to prepare for the Zhi Gong Party Congress. He has met with the Chairman in Nanjing, who gave him a personal audience and greatly encouraged him.

### Overseas Chinese Shanghai General Association Urges Protection of Overseas Chinese

They also passed several resolutions regarding the protection of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, requesting the government to determine a policy on the Dutch East Indies issue. At the same time, they telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, urging him to protect overseas Chinese.

### Hu Hao Comes to Shanghai to Prepare for the Establishment of the Xinghu Daily News

### Reporting Film and Theater Personnel Who Collaborated With the Enemy, the Drama Association Continues to Receive Reports

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Drama and Film Association's Committee for Reporting Film and Theater Personnel Who Collaborated With the Enemy drafted principles for reporting some time ago, printed reporting forms and lists, and distributed them widely to film and theater personnel throughout the city, in order to collect ideas and gather opinions. Yesterday at 2:00 PM, representatives of the association went to the Zheng Bureau to open mailbox No. 1396, seal the letters, and schedule a date to open the ballots, count them, and study them. For the sake of caution, the association will continue to receive letters and evidence of reports, and clarified three points: (1) The testing and investigation of this reporting form is only a preliminary work, and the statistical results are not an official list of those who collaborated with the enemy. (2) The list of those who collaborated with the enemy that will be published in the future will only be provided to the authorities for reference, with no extreme punishment. (3) The association expressed regret that the government failed to provide assistance to the association, and that collaborators with unclear identities, such as Han Langan, participated in filming.

### A Gathering of Great Historical Significance: Public Memorial to Martyrs at Cuixiu Hall, Comrades of the Merchant Corps Relive Old Times

The Shanghai Merchant Corps Comrades Association of the Xinhai Revolution held a gathering yesterday at the Cuixiu Hall of the Yimiao Temple to commemorate the revolutionary martyrs of the Merchant Corps who died in the line of duty, take a group photo, and dine together, in order to relive old times and to build a memorial hall and compile a historical record. More than 200 people attended, including Zhu Shaoyi, the former commander of the Shanghai Merchant Corps, members of the Shangyu Society, the Qingzhen Merchant Corps, and members of various trade associations. Guests invited to participate included Dean Yu Youren, Chen Qicai, Hu Puan, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Shaoshu, Zhang Cheng, and others. After a group photo, a dinner was held. During the dinner, Dean Yu, Hu Puan, Wu Shaoshu, and Zhang Chenghun delivered speeches one after another. Dean Yu, in a passionate and stirring tone, encouraged the comrades to continue their efforts with the spirit of being old but strong, and to remain loyal to the Three Principles of the People and carry out the revolutionary mission. Hu Puan said that the youth of the past are now old, and the youth of today will also become old in the future, so the youth of today should seize the present, strive hard, and work diligently. Wu Shaoshu expressed his admiration for the revolutionary predecessors present, saying that although they are old, their revolutionary spirit is no less than in those years, and the young comrades should follow in the footsteps of their predecessors and continue to shoulder the arduous task of revolutionary nation-building. Zhu Shaoyi gave a reply, detailing the Shanghai Merchant Corps' assistance to General Chen Yingshi in attacking the Manufacturing Bureau and liberating Shanghai 35 years ago, which are all invaluable historical materials of heroism. The audience was extremely excited and responded with warm applause. There was also entertainment after the meal, and the gathering dispersed around 3:00 PM. At that time, the Shanghai Merchant Corps was organized automatically by citizens. Their participation in the revolution was purely out of patriotic enthusiasm, sacrificing themselves without seeking fame or gain. Their spirit of loyalty and integrity is worthy of admiration. The revolutionary history of the Merchant Corps is now 35 years in the past. Therefore, most of the members who attended the meeting yesterday were elderly people with gray hair. The youngest among them was also past the age of fifty. They looked back on the past and could not help but be filled with emotion. At a time when the country is in turmoil and the people are demoralized, this gathering with great revolutionary and historical significance makes one feel a sense of "darkness before dawn."

### Strengthen Police Force to Prevent Petty Thieves

The curfew in the city was officially lifted at midnight on the 15th. Yesterday, this reporter met with the person in charge of the police bureau and asked about the state of public security after the curfew was lifted. He said that the situation was not satisfactory, as there were seven or eight robbery cases the night before last. The responsible parties have decided to increase the police force to ensure public security. In addition to the original 2,000 police officers in the urban area, 1,800 members of the Security Corps will be reorganized into a Security Police Brigade, specializing in maintaining public security at night. It was also learned that the director of the Police Training School was originally held concurrently by Director Xuan, but Director Xuan is now too busy with political affairs to handle both duties. He has submitted a request to resign from the post, which has been approved, and Deputy Director Yu Shuping has been appointed to concurrently hold the position. The handover procedures were completed at the Yulin Road Police Training School at 9:00 AM yesterday.

### "Shanghai Nights" After the Curfew is Lifted, Scrambling for Business Outside Dance Halls, Stepping on Ants on Avenue Joffre

Maybe you don't need to walk on the streets after 12 o'clock every night, but for many Shanghai people, they haven't gotten used to going to bed early and getting up early in the past eight or nine years. Moreover, occasionally encountering some social events or urgent matters, wanting to walk on the road but not being able to, always feels inconvenient.

Three or four days ago, I saw in the newspaper that "the curfew will not be lifted for the time being." Who knew that two days later, with a "decree," this "sleepless city" that had been in "night" for many years began to revive. I wouldn't dare say that this is "good news" or "good fortune," but at least it is a matter of convenience for the citizens, especially allowing those who make a living from newspapers to worry less.

Half out of curiosity, and half because I was conveniently dropping people off in my car, I made a round of the streets on the first night after the curfew was lifted. East to Tilanqiao, south to Xiaoximen, then around Nanjing Road to Haig Road, and then a sightseeing tour of Avenue Joffre. The result proved that this "sleepless city" was indeed reviving, although it was still in its early stages.

Probably because it was Saturday, the Bund was especially lively. American sailors were returning "drunk" in groups of twos and threes. Although the rickshaws were empty, they could still find customers to ride to the west. The reporting sound from the loudspeakers on the Bund pier and the surrounding lights seemed especially "loud" and "bright." This lively scene therefore affected all the way to Tilanqiao. In the past, Hongkou and other areas would have been as quiet as a deep valley at this time, but now it was surprisingly noisy, and I kept hearing "Rickshaw? Rickshaw?" "Pedicab? Pedicab?"

Walking into Nanshi, it was also very different from the night before. In addition to the lights in front of each household, many food shops were still open, and the song "A Mother's Heart" from the radio could be heard from 150 meters away.

Running to the urban area again, there were more stalls on the road than during the day, especially on the cross streets or at corners, where the lights shone, simply blinding people. On the fruit stall, a Florida tangerine looked extraordinarily bright from afar. The wonton stall owner no longer needed to tap his melancholic bamboo clapper to find customers. The cold noodle stall was full of customers, with the owners barely keeping up with the demand. The cold drink stall owner, busy all day, still had to sell large quantities of orange juice at night. However, the apprentices in those shop alleys could take a break at this time, finding a neighbor, moving a few stools, crossing their legs, talking about legends and stories, and enjoying the cool breeze, with a sense of leisure and contentment.

Needless to say, Nanjing Road was busy, where one could normally drive full throttle, and the intersection of Xizang Road and Nanjing Road, after the curfew was lifted, immediately became prosperous. Cars had to stop for one or two minutes at the intersection to get through. The rickshaw pullers in front of the Xianle Dance Hall could even fight to snatch customers. The guests staggered out, seeming to resent that it had closed too early.

In comparison, the poetic Avenue Joffre did not lose its original character. There were far fewer vehicles, the wonton and noodle vendors had no way to perform their signature stunts, and there were few pedestrians. But occasionally, you could find a few couples of young people who liked to step on ants under the moonlight, not knowing whether they were going home or just going out!

After the curfew was lifted, the most unlucky people were the police, who had to carry their guns high and pace back and forth. In addition to them, the American military police were working even harder than before, with a jeep in the east and a jeep in the west. Moreover, they would only stop in the center of the road, using flashlights to inspect every jeep that passed, in an extraordinarily tense manner.

There is no doubt that in a few days, in the stillness of midnight, you might as well take a stroll on the road, and you will definitely hear the sound of mahjong games and be able to appreciate beautiful music. Who says Shanghai is in a slump? Shanghai people's new tricks are already ready, and in the near future, you will see that Shanghai's late night is even more prosperous than it was eight years ago (Mai Tian).

### Evening

— Luo Hong

When you are still wearing soft pajamas, standing at the window with a sleepy look, facing the bright morning sky, inhaling fresh air, watching one or two wisps of thin clouds drifting lazily by, or watching small flocks of birds flying gracefully in the morning breeze, that is truly the most leisurely thing. If you wake up from a dream, peeking through the gap in the curtains at a large patch of azure, listening to the faint sound of the city coming from afar, you can reach for a favorite book on the pillow and read, or hum a favorite song idly, what a charming scene that is!

However, for those of us who bear the heavy burden of life, where can we find such leisurely days? Squeezed by life, we are often so burdened that we can hardly breathe. During the Anti-Japanese War, in many small cities in the interior, I saw those thin horses carrying overly heavy objects, walking long distances, their heads drooping, silently enduring the burden. It is said that these skinny horses are used exclusively for transporting goods. By analogy, how are people different from these poor skinny horses? For the sake of life, the burden we carry is really not light. Every day, we are just arranging to pass the days quickly, letting the burden of life weigh us down, squeezing ourselves under the giant wheel of existence. Only in the evening can we give ourselves a breather, sit lazily in my chair, watching the branches blown by the evening breeze in the distance, looking at the setting sun hanging on the corner of the wall, indulging in a few comfortable breaths of air. All the dreams of hope also float up at this time, finding a little self-deprecating comfort in the burden of life.

Therefore, in any season, I often love the evening the most, and I love the evenings of summer and autumn even more. The summer evenings are especially beautiful, making people feel so cool and gorgeous. If you wear a light, thin garment, standing under the shade of a tree or next to a low fence, letting the evening breeze play with your short hair and the corners of your clothes, that is much cooler than sitting in a coffee shop eating shaved ice. Moreover, the azure sky, rendered by the setting sun into quite beautiful clouds, makes people feel a gentle pleasure when looking at it.

In the past few years of refugee life, it was rare to stay in one place for half a year or a year. Often, we would travel during the day, our minds reeling from the jolting of the highway buses, or in a sailboat, feeling so bored that we just wanted to doze all day. So, when we rested in a place in the evening, we washed away the dust, let our tired bodies bathe in the sunset, and appreciated the different twilight scenes of various places, which was considered the only enjoyment in life. Perhaps it is because of this that I feel especially close to the evening.

I also love the autumn evenings, their quiet demeanor and slightly melancholic atmosphere, so easily reminding people of the past, and gently evoking many aspirations. Life is so fleeting and mysterious. A person who is committed to life and unwilling to easily bow to it is also prone to feeling disappointed in everything. This disappointment does not necessarily make a person negative, make them resentful, but it is very likely to make a person silent, and many aspirations float in their heart. Like me, a person who feels uncomfortable everywhere in life, of course, can only confide my innermost thoughts to the quiet twilight. So, often after a day of fatigue, I sit in my *** chair, take a deep breath, as if blowing away all the troubles of the day, silently watching the evening sky, watching flocks of flying birds skimming past my window.

### Serial Novel: Double Flight (5) (6)

— Zhao Qingge

The New Year holidays are over, and Xiao Hong's new life has also begun. Now she handles everything: cooking, washing clothes, sewing, and taking care of the boss's beloved son. But she has no complaints; she regards all of this as her duty; she should work. In this family, she has become familiar with everyone, except for Liao Dong—her future husband—who is still unfamiliar; and so unfamiliar that she hardly sees him every day. If she happens to encounter him, Liao Dong acts as if she doesn't exist, without any sign of recognition! Let alone trying to strike up a conversation. Therefore, Xiao Hong thinks: "Why does he ignore me?" She is quite puzzled! But she cannot ask Liao Dong. Several times she saw Liao Dong's clothes were dirty, and she prepared to ask him to take them off so she could wash them for him, but she couldn't bring herself to say it! Firstly, she was afraid of being embarrassed, and secondly, she was afraid Liao Dong would blame her for being presumptuous. In her little heart, she is constantly worrying about this stranger-like future husband.

Now, Yuan Chun Tang has already tightened its belt. Only Bao Ling and a Master Li, who creates medicines, are left in the shop. Therefore, they have to do the work of several people. Although business is still sluggish, there are still quite a few things to do. Bao Ling has even become a general helper. Besides keeping accounts, he is responsible for wrapping the medicine when customers buy it, after Master Li has weighed the portions. Every day, he also has to wipe the tables and sweep the floor. Moreover, the boss's wife constantly orders him to run errands, acting as a "general assistant," (a mahjong term) with no free time from morning to night. Bao Ling endures all of this! Because his goal is to "support himself," to earn a living by his own labor. This is not a disgrace; he is willing to suffer; this is training! That's what he thinks. Like Xiao Hong, he has no complaints. Sometimes Liao Dong can't bear to watch and helps him with something, but Bao Ling often refuses. He tells Liao Dong: "Only those who can endure hardship can be independent and can walk without fear of falling." Although he says this, he feels very sad in his heart! What makes him sad is: If the old master had lived a few more years, he could have studied for a few more years, then his prospects would have been broader, and he wouldn't have had to do this kind of hard labor. But now, he can only work hard for others, one could even say he is a slave! A beast of burden!

Heaven "helps the wicked and mistreats," working against the poor. The winter wasn't very cold, then suddenly a spring cold like a fierce tiger pounced on Jingzhou with great ferocity! After a heavy snow, the house would freeze. The northwest wind, blowing on the face, felt like small knives cutting you painfully. People's ears were frozen into red, swollen rotten oranges, people's hands and feet were frozen into wood; the snot flowed down, and if you didn't wipe it away after a while, it would freeze into two glass rods; dangling on the upper lip. But this was only so severe for some people; some people didn't care at all. Because they could go out wearing fur coats and warm themselves by the brazier at home, the cold could not invade their bodies, so they would not think about how those suffering in the icy and snowy weather were being threatened! For example, the boss's wife, she wears a sheepskin coat and keeps a brazier burning in the house. She herself is like a warm current, and when she walks beside you, you feel warm. Even though her heart is so cold that it makes you shiver!

Recently, the boss's wife has returned to her normal state (not very elegant, anger is her normal state; happiness and peace are her abnormality). Except for Boss Liao and Liao Dong, everyone else in the family, big and small, has become a non-human animal in her eyes. Especially towards Xiao Hong, she has not only forgotten that she will be the future eldest daughter-in-law of this family, but also forgotten that she is a human being with flesh and blood! The short period of polite and preferential treatment has passed. Now, from morning to night, the boss's wife cannot let Xiao Hong's hands and feet rest for a moment.

### General Du Yuming Suggests Setting Up Three University Preparatory Classes in the Northeast, Each Class Accommodating 1,500 Students

### Primary School Curriculum Research Forum (7)

Problems in Hygiene Training for Primary School Students

A hygiene subject should be added to the primary school curriculum. We should not have any extravagant hopes; it is enough for children to understand some of the most basic hygiene knowledge and maintain their personal health. The arrangement of this scientific teaching material can be divided into three stages: elementary, intermediate, and advanced, according to the cyclical method (circular method) of textbook compilation. Each stage should still be divided into volumes one, two, three, and four, according to the distribution of textbooks, making it easy to difficult, so that children's life knowledge can progress from shallow to deep, and then to even deeper, without any psychological difficulty, and achieve their final goal of maintaining their own health. Only in this way can the meaning of education not be lost. (Fan Jiagui, 35.6.130)

Children fundamentally have no interest in subjects with such a strong educational color as hygiene. If training is implemented, it will instead foster a sense of disgust in children. I propose that the stories in the language arts subject, the lyrics in the music subject, and the appreciation books in the art subject should try to incorporate teaching material on hygiene, which is easier to increase teaching efficiency by instilling it to children invisibly (Shi Debang 35.6.13, Anqing)

The list of hygiene training items is up to one hundred and thirty-five items, which is indeed too tedious. In reality, it would be enough if all the students of a primary school could achieve the two basic hygiene items of "neatness" and "cleanliness." Being simple and easy, achieving twice the result with half the effort, I ask the education authorities to start from this simple aspect. (Yang Liuqing, 35.6.14, Hangzhou)

### The Tragedy of the Old Man (Fiction) (Part 1)

— Tian Qin

Before the old man became an old man, he had a very decent son. Although he had not read much, he could write accounts or write sale contracts, pawn contracts, and loan notes—those property-related things that were closely related to the farmers. Therefore, not only his father—no, let's just call him the old man. Even all the uncles and elders in the village thought his son was promising. The old man was of course overjoyed to have such a son.

However, the old man did not have any "property." Even after his wife passed away, he was unable to remarry. His property was his only son—Si Dai.

The old man took his son to the fields all day long, crawling (robe) in the soil for food all year round. However, a poor household with no land to stand on cannot withstand drought or floods, no matter how hard they work. And there was the land rent that had to be paid on time as usual... These heavy burdens made it impossible for him to breathe.

Don't think that the old man lived a hard life, but he had to enjoy himself every now and then. Of course, there was nothing to eat in the countryside. In fact, his desires were not high, and he didn't want to eat anything delicious at all. At most, he would drink two ounces of Laobaigan. He had a bit of a stutter, but that didn't matter. Although his stutter was worse after drinking, once his "talk box" was opened, it simply couldn't be closed.

After drinking, he only had the problem of talking too much, but his mind was still relatively clear. So, his son-teaching lesson was often taught after drinking.

I don't remember what day it was, but after the father and son finished their work in the fields, the sun had just begun to set. The old man discovered that there were many fish jumping in the trench, so he quietly told Si Dai to quickly bring the five-pronged iron fork that was placed on the boat. Si Dai understood his father's meaning and went straight to the boat to get the fork without saying a word.

After the old man got the iron fork, he stood on a ridge near the river, his eyes as round as saucers, staring intently at the emerald green water surface. When ripples appeared on the water surface, with a "peng" sound, the iron fork pierced into the bottom of the water, and immediately a carp weighing two or three pounds was lifted up. The old man smiled, using a green Tibetan reed as a rope, piercing through the fish gills, tying a knot, carrying the fish in one hand and the fork in the other, and walked towards his small boat with a small amount of sweat on his forehead.

When his father was spearing fish, Si Dai hid alone in the boat reading the borrowed "Seven Heroes and Five Gallants." He was so engrossed in reading that he didn't even see his father when the old man was about to board the boat. Si Dai's fascination was that great. When the old man's foot stepped on the bow of the boat, it naturally swayed two or three times, and this startled the son out of his daze.

He raised his head in a corner of the stern and looked at his father's posture and couldn't help but laugh out loud.

"Dad! You really got it."

"Si Dai, today your dad will have wine to drink,"

"What? Dad, aren't we going to cook it ourselves? You're going to sell it."

"Hmph! Cook it ourselves? Silly boy, it weighs several pounds, your dad really can't bear to sell it. Our "jiaoguo" of several days (i.e., living expenses) will be enough. Not to mention, Dad can still drink two ounces. Why… why shouldn’t I… shouldn’t I sell it!"

Si Dai of course didn't dare to rebel. Firstly, he was his dad, and secondly, what Dad said also made sense. Although he was a little greedy and wanted to boil the fish to eat, Dad had his own ideas. Not to mention, the fish was speared by Dad, so of course Dad had the right to dispose of it. Besides, he didn't help when Dad was spearing the fish, and secretly hid in the boat to read novels. Dad didn't get angry, and that was already enough face. It would be an excessive request to insist that Dad not sell the fish and eat it himself. What's more, the old man had a wine addiction, and if he didn't sell the fish, where would the money come from to buy wine?

Thinking of this, Si Dai suddenly remembered the face of the female shopkeeper when Dad bought wine on credit at the small shop, which was enough to feed fifteen people for half a month. Thinking it over, he thought that Dad's idea was right. So, later, he didn't say anything, and without waiting for Dad to speak, he started rowing the boat towards his own village!

That was exactly the late spring season, with a dark blue sky covering a green scene. The entire countryside was like being covered with a velvet felt. The reeds along the banks of the two rivers stood upright like silk bamboo. Occasionally, a small gust of wind came, and they swayed aimlessly with the wind, making a rustling sound.

In the lower reaches of the river, near the edges of the banks, emerald green lotus plants floated on the surface. Ducks swam leisurely back and forth in groups on the water, and when they were happy, they also sang "quack, quack." Crows and other small birds flew in the sky from time to time. The willows on both banks swayed in the evening wind, as if forming a welcoming team for the father and son who were driving the boat.

Although the surrounding scenery was so beautiful and lovely, they didn't feel much about it in their eyes, because they were already used to it.

While rowing the boat, Si Dai sang loudly. What he sang was neither Western songs nor skin **, but authentic Bangzi opera Qinqiang. This was the skill he learned in the village opera club, and he had already performed on stage several times. He was a very famous rural amateur actor. Not only could he sing well, but his martial arts skills were also quite impressive, because he played martial arts roles. He had just turned sixteen this year, but he had not yet married. In fact, the old man did not have the idea of having grandchildren early on, but because of poverty, everything was out of the question. To be honest, at that time, the old man was only forty years old, and theoretically, he could remarry. In fact, didn't the old man also have this idea? But once he thought about the problems of the young, whether it was his son getting married or himself remarrying, both were out of the question. Money "held" people like this!

Although the old man often boasted to others that his son was good-looking, with a full forehead and a wide, square face, and that he would definitely be rich and noble in the future, and that when that day came, he would become an old man, he did not object to his son learning opera. Of course, they learned opera in the evenings, which did not hinder the daytime work, which was also the main reason.

Therefore, he didn't say anything when Si Dai sang opera to amuse himself while rowing the boat. Moreover, he was smiling and listening intently, smoking his ** tobacco pipe.

When the boat reached the shore, the sun had not yet touched the mountains. The old man carried the fish in his left hand and took a thread in his right hand and went ashore. After turning the rope around a small tree several times, he tied a knot, and the boat stopped there. The old man went back to his only ancestral property—the small, dilapidated house—and Si Dai took off the paddle, carried it on his shoulder, and followed him off the boat. After putting the paddle in the house, he said to the old man, "Dad, what shall we cook?"

The old man looked at his son, put the fish in front of him, "Si Dai, first sell it in the street, and then cook when you return. I'm not very hungry yet..."

Si Dai didn't say anything, took the fish and went out, but as soon as he got to the threshold, the old man spoke again.

"Si Dai, take my wine bottle with you. After selling the fish, remember to buy four ounces of wine for me. Also, wrap two ounces of broad beans to eat with the wine... Oh, if there are sesame cakes or fried dough sticks for sale, you can buy a few sets to eat yourself. Anyway, I don't want to eat dinner after drinking wine. You can just eat a few sets of sesame cakes and fried dough sticks, so you don't have to cook. You have been working hard these days. Dad should also buy something to reward you... Okay, go."

Si Dai turned around, took the old man's wine pot, nodded, and went to the street.

After his son left, the old man also felt a little tired. He sat on the kang, leaning his back against the mud wall, and smoked his old Guandong leaf tobacco one bag after another. After Si Dai left, things went quite smoothly. Without waiting to shout, the small son of the big landlord bought it for the price of one dollar. (To be continued)

### Small Chants in a Humble Room

— Zhang Che

(I)

In front of the small door, children play
On the garden trees, sparrows sing
Far away from the hustle and bustle of the city
Watching the white clouds strolling leisurely in the blue sky

(II) Green

To cherish the small grass on the steps, the door is closed tightly
To embellish the green in the courtyard, the window paper is torn off
The midday sun shines on the beautiful leaves
The white wall is smeared with the emerald green of the lake in spring

(III) Leisure

Above the head is a boundless blue sky
The heart is a blank sheet of paper without words
The eyes watch the movement of the grim-faced second hand
The soul sleeps on the green leaves outside the window

### Last Week's Gold Notes Initially Thriving Then Weak, Rice Prices Stagnant, Government Bonds Plunging, Yarn and Cloth Weak

Last week, gold notes flourished. Importers eagerly absorbed US dollars, pushing prices steadily upward. However, a decline began toward the weekend, ultimately closing two hundred yuan higher than the previous week. Gold also surged due to the rise in US dollars, climbing sixty to seventy thousand yuan compared to the previous weekend. The two most popular stocks were relatively stable, while the rest varied between flat and weak. Trading in foreign stocks was minimal, with a weak foundation. Given unfavorable redemption circumstances, the overall market trend declined. The rice market showed little improvement, but rice weevils remained secretly active. The following is a report on the market conditions for the week:

Hwa Chi: The week started with gradual improvement, driven by unstable conditions and a strong US dollar. Frequent absorption led the price to rise from 1,860,000 to 1,895,000. On Tuesday, it further soared to 1,960,000. However, due to profit-taking, it fell as low as 1,865,000 by Thursday. On Friday, the US dollar rose again, and prices followed suit, closing at 1,910,000. Saturday saw limited fluctuations, with the final price at 1,900,000. Throughout the week, the Central Bank allocated 1,451 bars, with Thursday's allocation price being the lowest and Wednesday's 1,960,000 being the highest.

Foreign Currency: A large quantity of luxury goods from abroad arrived in Shanghai using US dollars. Settlement led to eager absorption, and holders seized the opportunity to raise prices. The week began at 2,510 yuan, rising to 2,800 yuan by Wednesday. Subsequently, due to strict Central Bank controls on US dollar trading, confidence weakened, and the price retreated to 2,670 yuan. On Thursday, it continued to decline. Although importers later had needs, the market turned stronger. However, by Saturday afternoon, a straight-line decline had commenced.

Government Bonds: Monday was firm. On Tuesday, due to redemption, individual investors became nervous and cut their losses significantly. Additionally, short sellers took the opportunity to act, causing the market to decline. Type C bonds closed at 5,000 yuan the previous day, but opened as low as 5,005 on this day. The final price edged up slightly to 5,250. Types A, B, and E once reached 3,250, and Type D reached 3,030. Monday saw rumors of customs gold redemption, triggering short selling activity, and the market continued to decline sharply. Type C bonds retreated from 5,200 to 4,350, Types A, B, and E to 2,700, and Type D to 2,250. On Thursday, northern merchants took advantage of low prices to absorb and cover their short positions significantly, causing prices to rebound. On Saturday, securities firms sold short, and amidst the selling pressure, trends were mixed. Type C bonds retreated to 4,600, Types A and B to 2,750, Type D to 2,550, and Type E to 2,950.

Chinese Stocks: Monday saw profit-taking, and the market turned weak after being firm. Tuesday saw a rebound due to short covering. Wing On Textile rose to 6,005, Maya to 4,600, Jingfu to 315, Xinguang to 310, Qinxing to 240, and the rest also rose. Wednesday saw frequent profit-taking, and the market slightly retreated. Thursday saw continued profit-taking, and prices gradually declined. However, Wing On Textile uniquely showed strength amidst rumors of new stock issuance, rising from 6,000 yuan to 6,450. The rest saw mixed fortunes. Friday saw long positions in unpopular stocks taking profits, and prices were mostly weak. Popular stocks were flat for Wing On Textile, rebounded for Maya, and slightly declined for Jingfu, etc. Saturday saw Wing On Textile taking the lead, as the imminent listing of new shares invigorated confidence and boosted buying interest. Prices trended upward, once reaching beyond 6,700 yuan, and closing at 6,650. The rest were flat or weak.

Foreign Stocks: The week began with firmness and stability. Long positions frequently absorbed, but the foundation was weak, and trading was lackluster. Wheelock rose to 16,000 on Monday and to 17,500 on Tuesday. From Wednesday onward, it showed weakness, and continued to decline to 15,000 on Saturday. Ewo Silk rose from 11,300 on Tuesday to 12,500. However, it gradually declined and closed at 11,300 on Saturday, the same as Monday's closing price. Union Insurance rose from 10,000 yuan on Tuesday to 11,000. It retreated to 10,300 on Wednesday and Thursday, rebounded to 10,100 on Friday, and retreated to within 10,000 yuan on Saturday, with trading at 9,800. The rest saw mixed fortunes.

Food: Under strict supervision by the authorities, speculative rice dealers found it difficult to operate. However, off-market black market trading occurred, drawing significant attention. Buying and selling in the market saw little change throughout the week. It was difficult to differentiate between different grades. There was a slight fluctuation once on Wednesday. Holders were unwilling to sell at market prices, leading to the disposal of all secondary goods. However, high-quality goods were still available. On the same day, the social bureau posted a notice in the market, earnestly advising legitimate rice merchants to trade according to regulations. On Thursday, the mayor personally visited the rice market, urging compliance with regulations. On Friday, thirty-three rice shops were allocated ten shih of rice each from designated rice merchants at market prices to meet the needs of their retail customers. On Saturday, the trend showed a slight turnaround, but people remained uneasy.

Raw Cotton: In the past week, sales to merchant groups were intermittent, lacking large-scale transactions. Prices hovered between 50,000 and 100,000 yuan. This was because the Shanghai Textile Construction Company increased its output due to seasonal factors. As for popular goods such as 42-count and 32-count double-strand fine yarn, supply was also available at times, and in addition, there was also a significant amount of output from other privately operated yarn factories, so it seemed that there were more chips available on the market. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn and other similar yarns were previously too high, and 20-count and 16-count yarn were too low, but they are now gradually approaching equilibrium, and there is a possibility that they will become increasingly balanced in the future. The Shanghai Textile Construction Company opened 28 varieties of yarn on Monday, 30 varieties on Wednesday, and 28 varieties on Friday, for a total of 86 varieties.

Cloth Market: Because the Shanghai Textile Construction Company opened up more cloth sales, and in addition, there was a flood of foreign goods, merchant groups and door-to-door vendors had ordinary needs during the week, and there was absolutely no change in the market. The whole scene was calm and stable. There was not much change in various cloths from the previous week. The Shanghai Textile Construction Company opened 30 varieties of cloth on Tuesday and 24 varieties of American-made cloth. On Thursday, they opened 30 varieties of cloth and 11 varieties of Mexican-made cloth. On Saturday, they opened 30 varieties of cloth and 19 varieties of American-Mexican cloth.

Dyed Cloth: During the week, the Shanghai Textile Construction Company remained in a wait-and-see state and did not purchase any dyed cloth. In addition, private yarn factories such as Dachen, Minfeng, Anda, Dasheng, Shenxin No. 2 Factory, Sulun, Jiafeng, Qingfeng, Baofeng, and Xinyu factories made considerable purchases. The market situation was more active than the yarn and cloth sectors. The price of high-grade Metteline cloth delivered to the factories reached 109,000 yuan. As a result, the prices of various dyed cloths rose by about three to four thousand yuan compared to the previous weekend. The prices of American cotton futures and spot goods in overseas New York both rose by more than 30 pounds each, it is said.

Rayon: 120-count Tianqiao rayon was 1,420,000 yuan on Monday, rose 60,000 yuan on Tuesday, and retraced 40,000 yuan on Wednesday. On Thursday, the upward trend was strong again, because the price of goods opened by the China Textile Company was enough to sway the market price, so it rose by 70,000 yuan on Friday and by 40,000 yuan on Saturday. As a result, Saturday's price was 140,000 yuan higher than Monday's. The price of miscellaneous brand 120-count bright rayon also rose by 160,000 to 170,000 yuan, and the price of 75-count Golden Rooster semi-bright rayon also rose by 160,000 yuan.

Filature Silk: The Gaoyun Duyo Trading Company had no appetite for silk at all. The intermediate grades of 75-point and 77-point silk with inspection reports were sold between 2,200,000 yuan and 275,000 yuan. Transactions in silk for end-users were relatively lively. The prices of various grades all increased by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan during the week. The Gaoyun Duyo Trading Company goods were sold for 1,800,000 yuan on Saturday by end-users. The price of the Gaoyun Duyo Trading Company silk was generally around 1,550,000 to 600,000 yuan during the week.

Silk Fabrics: There were quite a few changes last week, not lacking speculator involvement. Maya bed covers were 1,470,000 yuan on Monday, and immediately sold for 600,000 yuan after three days. Prices were down 50,000 yuan on Thursday and continued to be weak with very little sales on Friday. On Saturday, they were again sold for around 600,000 yuan, an overall increase of 120,000 to 30,000 yuan. The early week price of Dachen checkered crepe de Chine was 5,100 to 5,200 yuan. It was purchased by a major buyer on Tuesday and soared upwards. By Wednesday, it had risen more than 10% compared to Monday. Because there was no shortage of high-level selling on Thursday, it collapsed. It was still weak on Friday. On Saturday, the old habits relapsed, and it was still sold at the highest price on Wednesday. The overall increase during the week was around 500 yuan.

Metals: This week, due to the increase in factory prices and the lack of orders from the United States, the market was firmer than last week. Because the Xinghua Dog Brand V door locks did not have a large output, they were not yet on the market. Door locks and drawer locks were quite prosperous because of purchases from merchant groups and because wages were increasing. Galvanized iron pipes with a diameter of one inch or more arrived. Four- and six-point pipes were quite profitable because they were in short supply. The rest of the goods were average and did not have much price movement.

### Hong Kong Permits Export of Foreign Paper, with Separate Quantity Limits

(Hong Kong Dispatch) The matter of prohibiting the export of foreign paper from this city was repeatedly requested by the Foreign Paper Merchants Association to be relaxed based on reasoned arguments. Recently, the authorities have repeatedly convened relevant merchants for discussions and made the following decisions. For printing paper and miscellaneous paper that obtained a transshipment certificate upon import, a limited quantity will be permitted for export. The limit for newsprint is 75%, and the limit for miscellaneous paper is 90%. The Customs will be authorized to handle the matter, it is said.

### American Agricultural Experts to Arrive in China on a Regular Basis to Assist in Developing Agricultural Products; Silk, Wool, and Tung Oil Will All Be Studied

(United Press Washington, 15th) American and Chinese agricultural experts will establish a permanent plan for Chinese agriculture within the next six months, enabling Chinese farmers to obtain greater harvests. This matter was proposed by the National Government, and the American representative, led by Dr. Hugh, Vice-President and Dean of the College of Agriculture at the University of California, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on July 1st. Another representative is Mr. Booker, a member of the United States Department of Agriculture, who taught at Jinling University for many years. According to Mr. Booker, this plan is valuable and beneficial to both China and the United States. We will assist China in making better use of its natural resources and enable the personnel and funds used to obtain greater returns. The American delegation consists of a total of nine people, with expertise in various agricultural sectors. China will also appoint a delegation to cooperate with the American delegation. All items related to agriculture, from silk to tung oil and the wool used to manufacture carpets, will be studied by Chinese and American experts. A major objective of this plan is to increase harvests and stabilize production. Taking tung oil as an example, the United States needs more high-quality tung oil, supplied in a stable quantity at a stable price, which does not conflict with tung oil production in the United States. After arriving in China, the American delegation will stay in Nanjing and Shanghai for several weeks to become more familiar with the various issues, and then travel across the country, spending two months examining the rural situation in detail. In addition to Hugh and Booker, the delegation includes seven other members: Case, President of the University of Illinois; Feines, engineering consultant at the Huaihua Mining University; Scheutz of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute; Clay, a member of the Department of Agriculture; Nanspeeder, fisheries consultant to the China Branch of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration; and Hermore, an agricultural educator for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.

### US Wheat Exports Have Reached 9 Million Tons

(Reuters Washington, 15th) US Secretary of Agriculture Anderson recently gave a broadcast stating that the US government currently has enough wheat stored to fulfill its aid obligations through the end of June. The problem lies entirely in how to accelerate shipments to various locations. Anderson acknowledged that the obligations have not yet been met, but the grains moved have exceeded any other country. Over the past twelve months, the grains exported accounted for 40% of the world's total, including 9 million tons of wheat. Exports from the 1945 harvest are expected to reach 10 million tons.

### US Gasoline Controls to be Lifted; Inventories Hoarded

[Reuters New Haven 15th] Inquiries regarding gasoline are pouring in from domestic and foreign sources, causing the price of gasoline to be firm and profitable. In addition, no one is selling off inventories, effectively bringing trade to a standstill. A few sales at high prices are the exception. The reasons for this eager demand are: (1) Oil transportation personnel may strike, and (2) Oil sources already show signs of contraction, leading to this situation. Refiners also see that the controls on petroleum products will be lifted at the end of June, so they are extremely unwilling to release large amounts of stored oil. Currently, the domestic and foreign demand for kerosene and light fuel is still quite urgent, and the demand in the winter of this year is expected to be enormous, so everyone hopes that the depleted inventories can be replenished in advance. In addition, because holders are firmly unwilling to sell, even if a few heavy fuels can be obtained, they are extremely small.

### Speaking from the Crisis of National Industry at the Current Stage to the Inevitability of China's Industrial Development in the Future by Zhang Boan

A highly developed national industry does not depend on simple conditions, but on the cooperation of many conditions. The most important of these is "personnel." Everything has to be done by people. If personnel are not in place, everything is hopeless.

The crisis of China's industry did not begin today. After July 7th, Chinese industry in general enjoyed wartime prosperity. Its development can be said to be very rapid, but it can also be said that because it was a "wartime" prosperity, it developed very quickly and collapsed very quickly.

As early as the spring of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], the Chongqing Relocated Factories Federation pointed out the crisis of Chinese industry. At the same time, Minister Weng also devised various methods to remedy it. However, the development of industry is gradual. During development, no pressure can be used to impede it. Conversely, when it collapses, it naturally deteriorates, and no remedial methods can help.

Before the war, it could not be said that China's national industry was "in embryonic form." During the war, there were no industrial conditions to support it in the remote mountains. How could industry be established? After the war, the original industrial property in the coastal industrial areas was recovered as a whole. However, because "personnel" were not in place, not only was this property snatched back from the bloodbath not properly taken over, but also the production network was dismantled! This is not surprising, because after the sudden victory, all the steps were chaotic, and industrial production was also in an atmosphere of "chaos."

As for recently, national industry has entered a state of collapse from a crisis-ridden situation. Who caused this, and what led to it? This question is worth studying.

Recently, more than 20 factories in Shanghai have closed their doors, and many other factories are on the road to layoffs and salary reductions. The reason is that wages and raw material costs are high, while the value of finished products is low. Factories cannot survive and can only go to their deaths. But this is not alarming, because the current national industry seems to be infected with an epidemic disease. The young and the unhealthy will naturally die first, but the old and the healthy will also inevitably die. In fact, the current national industry is branded with a death warrant. Small-scale industries are interrupted because they cannot compete, while large-scale industries either eke out a living or directly engage in speculation. Production is not as good as speculation, and without speculation, they cannot survive. This is an abnormal phenomenon in industrial management. Secondly, many industries can actually compete with foreign goods and make high profits, but they also feel headache due to the epidemic disease. The reason is still wages and raw material costs, which are increasing daily. Industrialists only know how to continue the wartime profiteering mentality. When "wages" increase, they have an excuse to add on the prices, once, twice, repeatedly. What about the cost calculation book of the industrialists? For example, if the manufacturing cost of a certain product, according to the wartime profiteering calculation, is 10,000 yuan, plus a profit of 10,000 yuan, it is not "black-hearted." Assuming that the wage cost in this 10,000 yuan is 2,000, if it is to be increased to 3,000, the industrialist will turn it into 6,000, this is the wartime profiteering, which has afflicted the industry and poisoned the "workers"! Industrialists seem to be gambling, not engaging in industry. Make money today and squander it today, and then close the door tomorrow.

There are also many factories that are affected by the times, and everything is bureaucratized. From the manager to the small employees, everyone is thinking about their own pockets. Engaging in industry is like becoming an official. Since they are officials, all speculation and profiteering are unavoidable!

Based on this, the Chinese industries that can "survive" and can compete are simply the minority of the minority. However, the current industrial crisis is only temporary and cannot become the argument that Chinese industry will never succeed. However, based on the current actions of China's national industry, it can be said that most of them will close their doors. The more ambitious will still be able to "survive" and be able to "compete." "Things must rot first, and then insects will grow." Survival of the fittest. How can those who engage in industry escape the laws of nature? The current collapse of industry is a symbol of future recovery!

Then, will our national industry develop? To answer this question, I can say, "Why did China fight Japan to the end?" Fighting to the end is the fundamental desire of the entire people to survive. Is "China's industrialization" not also the fundamental desire of the entire people to survive? The current collapse of national industry can be summed up in one sentence: "the problem of people."

Originally, in terms of China's industrial conditions, it can be said that it is superior to others in every aspect. Is the intelligence of the Chinese people inferior to others? Just look at the wartime industries, all of which performed very brilliantly. Everything that was missing was found a way to replace it. At that time, the industrial conditions were far inferior to the present. We often have to strive. Now that all conditions are much better than before, how can we not strive? As for the strong enemies of foreign goods and the lack of industrial capital, these are not fundamental problems. The things manufactured by foreigners from far away are dumped in China. Can't we really "wait for work to be done"? And how can there be so much market wandering capital when there is a lack of industrial capital? These are all enough for us to think deeply and reflect—

### American Gasoline: Controls to be Lifted, Inventories Hoarded

[Reuters, New Arlen, 15th] Inquiries about gasoline from home and abroad have been pouring in, and gasoline prices have rebounded firmly. Moreover, no one is selling their inventories, and transactions have virtually come to a standstill. Only a few transactions have been completed at high prices, which are exceptional cases. The reasons for this urgent demand are: (1) Transportation workers may go on strike. (2) There are signs that oil sources are tightening. Furthermore, oil refiners, anticipating the lifting of controls on petroleum products at the end of June, are extremely reluctant to release large quantities of oil in storage. Currently, the demand for kerosene and light fuel oil both at home and abroad remains quite pressing, and it is anticipated that demand will be enormous this winter. Everyone hopes that depleted inventories can be replenished beforehand. Moreover, due to holders' unwillingness to sell heavy fuel oil, even if one or two transactions can be secured, the quantities are extremely small.

### The New American Auto King After the War

— Translated by Ding Ze

In the American automobile manufacturing industry, Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler have always been known as the Big Three. Starting this February, the emerging Kaiser-Frazer (Kaiser Frazer) automobile factory (hereinafter referred to as Kaiser-Frazer) joined the competition. Therefore, people in Detroit, the heart of American auto manufacturing, are watching this new factory with the same eyes as they observed Chrysler's rise and struggle in 1924.

The two owners of Kaiser-Frazer are already famous in the United States. Henry J. Kaiser is a well-known steel and heavy industry manufacturing giant. During the war, he handled almost all steel, metal, and machinery except for automobiles. Joseph W. Frazer has always been renowned in the automotive industry.

Kaiser-Frazer's new cars come in two models, each named after its owner, Frazer and Kaiser. The former is priced between $1,200 and $1,500, and its features include: 1. A new style body, 2. A wide front window, 3. A spacious body and seats, 4. A regular engine with 100 horsepower. The latter is priced at approximately $1,000, with a body similar to the former but using front-wheel drive. It weighs 500 pounds less than the Frazer and has slightly less horsepower. The Frazer car is intended to compete with mid-priced cars like Oldsmobile, Buick, Dodge, and Mercury. The Kaiser car is intended to compete with low-priced cars like Ford, Chevrolet, Chrysler, and Studebaker.

Kaiser-Frazer plans to manufacture in large quantities, projecting that each model will produce 750 cars per day this summer, with an annual output of approximately 300,000 cars.

Kaiser-Frazer currently has capital of over $20 million, as well as the machinery from the merged Graham-Paige automobile factory and the ability to manufacture new machines. Compared to the existing Big Three, Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler, which have a combined capital of $3.5 billion, the difference is vast.

The main tools used in automobile manufacturing are very valuable. For example, the full set of molds for pressing the steel shell of the car body costs $3 million. A complete set of machines for pressing car body doors and roofs costs $615,000. Therefore, given Kaiser-Frazer's current capital, people in New York and Detroit do not hold much hope for its success. Most of the criticisms are unfavorable. Some say that Frazer has never manufactured cars, and he is only good at selling them. Others say that Kaiser only knows how to build ships and is a layman when it comes to automobiles. Some say that Frazer might hire a group of engineers to manufacture cars for him, but it is unknown who would be willing to sell them. Still others say that this car factory may only be a speculative stock venture, which may endanger Kaiser's reputation, and so on. These types of criticisms inevitably contain some jealousy, but the establishment of this new car factory will undoubtedly accelerate the trend from conservatism to the adoption of modern new inventions.

Kaiser-Frazer has leased a large aircraft factory building in Willow Run for a term of five years. The factory will manufacture its own bodies, engines, and front-wheel drive components, while other components will be purchased as ready-made standard parts from the market.

At the time of writing, the factory building in Willow Run is being refitted with automobile machinery. Ford has moved everything out. The government's aircraft manufacturing equipment has also been moved to war surplus storage. Kaiser-Frazer has already ordered automobile tools and is in the process of installing them. Large quantities of steel materials are also arriving continuously, and advertisements have been drafted and are awaiting publication. Steel tycoon Kaiser is traveling east from the West Coast to inspect the factory. Dealerships across the country are preparing for the unveiling ceremony of the new cars. And Frazer, who is actually driving this new organization, is busy receiving guests in his huge office.

People close to Kaiser and Frazer do not deny that they will encounter a fierce automobile competition. However, they unanimously believe that there are four major advantages: 1. The advantages of the new car, 2. The large number of people eager to buy cars after the war, 3. The public's admiration for Kaiser's contributions during the war, 4. Frazer's past business successes.

Frazer's struggle in the automobile industry has been going on for a long time, and this is his third time investing in it. When Chrysler acquired the Maxwell automobile factory in 1924 with a capital of $4 million, Frazer was appointed as the sales manager of Chrysler, and later promoted to general manager and vice president. When Frazer left Chrysler in 1939, the factory had grown into one of the Big Three American automakers, with an annual turnover of $55 million. When Frazer joined Willys-Overland as general manager, it was at the company's lowest point, with an annual turnover of only $9 million and a total of 1,100 employees. By the time Frazer left Willys in 1943, the total number of employees had increased to 14,000, and the annual turnover had reached $170 million (this number increased to $212 million in 1944). Willys's development was partly due to Frazer's talent and partly due to the war. Willys became famous for building jeeps during the war, and although Frazer did not invent the jeep, his efforts to promote it nationwide were not insignificant.

Frazer's situation has always been good. Since joining Chrysler, he has consistently enjoyed a large salary. The new factory has set his annual salary at $82,500. His residence is comparable to that of other wealthy people. His hobbies are also the same as those of wealthy American businessmen. He has a large ranch in Arizona and a large farm in Olympia. In addition, he serves as a director of the Paramount Hotel in New York and is not interested in businesses other than automobiles.

Frazer's maternal lineage comes from the uncle of President Washington. Frazer received education from Yale University, and soon found work as a machinist's assistant with wages of only sixteen cents per hour. He then entered the Packard automobile factory school as a teacher, and soon after the Packard factory's New York dealership was established, Frazer began his career in automobile sales. Since 1914, Frazer has been involved in investing in automobiles, promoting automobiles, and promoting the automobile industry. He then transferred from the Packard factory to the export department of General Motors, then to the Pierce Arrow factory, and then to the Chrysler factory, where he made a big splash. After developing the factory for fifteen years, he took a group of capable engineers to the Willys-Overland factory. Frazer's usual motto is 'Conservatism is an illusion, and rest is not the purpose of life.' These two sentences can explain why Frazer left Chrysler at its peak and instead invested in the declining Willys-Overland factory. When Frazer was at Willys, there were many thorny problems to be solved. One week, there was even no money to pay wages, and he had to personally sell eighty-five cars to cope.

Frazer had already planned to manufacture his own cars when he was at Willys, but his proposal was not accepted by the chairman of Willys, so he resigned in 1943. This was the first time Frazer had left the automobile industry in thirty years. But ahead, there were two great opportunities: one was that the war could end, and the other was that the suspension of civilian car production during the war could resume. When these opportunities arrived, automobile manufacturers, whether new or old, could sell without advertising. Those who can manufacture good cars will find it easier to sell them. There is no need for the small market of the past, where they had to compete fiercely and spend huge sums on advertising. Frazer knew all these favorable points very well. However, after leaving the automobile industry, he had to raise a large amount of capital, find a large factory base, and design a car to organize.

In 1944, Frazer was invited by Warren Heavy Machinery to solve the difficulties it encountered. At that time, Warren Factory accepted a naval order for landing craft, but found difficulties in manufacturing. At this time, Frazer readily accepted the invitation, as he had a plan in mind to use this as an opportunity to devote himself to manufacturing cars. Later, he was able to realize his plan.

Frazer, based on the statutory minimum capital of $500 in Olympia, organized Warren Boiler Factory. He also borrowed a huge amount of money from the government to purchase machinery. With the planning of Frazer's outstanding engineers, the manufacturing difficulties were soon resolved. The government loan was gradually repaid. After six months, Graham-Paige automobile factory, because of the huge profits made from manufacturing automobiles, Graham, the major shareholder of the factory, seeing that the factory's future was not optimistic, because it had no significant reputation before the war and no fresh plans after the war, wanted to take this opportunity to sell his shares. Frazer immediately bought 530,000 shares with his comrades. At that time, Graham-Paige factory exchanged 150,000 shares for 500 shares of Warren factory. At this time, Frazer jumped to become the chairman of Graham-Paige automobile factory. The capital of Warren factory, which was initially formed with $500, suddenly became worth $300,000. Later, Frazer's new plan for automobiles after the war caused a sensation in the stock market, and the value of its shares increased sixfold, so its assets increased from $300,000 to $1.8 million. At this time, Frazer was smooth sailing, firmly in control of automobile manufacturing, and became the envy of Wall Street.

After Frazer became the chairman of Graham-Paige, he immediately reorganized and appointed a large number of engineers to improve ordinary gasoline engines. He also hired Howard Darrin, a famous car body designer, to specialize in designing fashionable car bodies. Darrin was known for his favor among Hollywood actresses and European elites.

In the spring of 1945, Germany surrendered. Kaiser, in order to expand his existing factory operations, constantly worked to seek cooperation with large capitalists. His efforts were comparable to Frazer's efforts to promote Packard cars to the Russian prince in 1913. Frazer traveled to Washington, D.C., New York, and other places, but only received advice and no investors. He then visited major aircraft factories in California, persuading them to transform into automobiles after the war, but no one responded. Finally, he met Giannini of the Bank of America, and encountered a stroke of luck. With Giannini's help, he met steel tycoon Kaiser the next day.

The two hit it off at first sight. In just two days, the plan for Kaiser-Frazer was laid down. The two had never met before, and Kaiser did not meet him when he was in the eastern United States last spring. Kaiser had always been interested in manufacturing automobiles. His motives were threefold: one was that the automobile industry was a big business. The second was to attract the automobile industry to the West Coast of the United States (because his steel business was all there). The third was to promote the sale of his steel and manganese products that had expanded during the war after the war. In 1942, Kaiser had a written argument with Frazer in the newspapers, disputing the automobile business. Frazer mocked him for talking about automobiles as a shipbuilder, which would inevitably make him a laughing stock in the industry.

Kaiser has actually manufactured cars in the past four years, having built eleven types. He is currently using a plaster car. This unique car is one of the eleven types mentioned above. Kaiser is confident that he can manufacture all parts in the western United States, but the car body is quite a problem. He went to Detroit to lobby, but the car body factories were very cold to him. Kaiser was frustrated and returned defeated. He originally planned to change his plan and manufacture small cars, but he soon met Frazer.

Today, Kaiser and Frazer are a perfect match after joining forces. Because of Kaiser's connections, he was able to lease the factory in Willow Run. The registration procedures for the new company originally required ten days, but after Kaiser personally negotiated with the government authorities, he said that he could build a ship for the government in as short as five days, so the government should also speed up the registration for him. Five days later, the registration was completed. Therefore, investors flocked to invest during the fundraising, and soon the number of shares subscribed exceeded the regulations by six and a half times. Today, letters from all over the United States are flying to Willow Run, with no less than 9,000 people contacting to distribute the cars, among which some are willing to abandon their old contracts to exclusively sell the new brand of cars. In their enthusiasm, one letter to Kaiser said that Kaiser's transport ship had carried home his son who was on an expedition, so he was determined to wait to buy a car made by Kaiser. Others praised Kaiser for his great success in shipbuilding and said that he would also succeed in building automobiles.

### Introduction to Business Administration

— Xu Baiyi

For example, if our manufacturing requires a considerable amount of labor, and we set up our factory near residential areas, then in the future, workers will have to come from afar, causing many inconveniences. The Yangshupu area in Shanghai has always been known as the factory area, and many workers live there. A manufacturing factory opened in the factory area will not have any difficulties in recruiting labor.

But on the one hand, of course, it also depends on the nature of the manufacturing factory. If it is a pharmaceutical factory, then it may as well choose a quiet place with good air and environment, which is more suitable for the manufacturing factory.

After a manufacturing factory is established, the workers will have long-term work, and they will also find houses near the factory to live in, making it more convenient to travel back and forth every day, but in any case, this is a problem worth considering, and it can become a rather important component in determining the location of the manufacturing factory.

(3) Assembly of various objects: There are several types of manufacturing factories that need to assemble various objects. The automobile manufacturing factory is one example. An automobile manufacturing factory does not manufacture its own tires. Even the car body is sometimes not made by itself. In this case, then when choosing the location of the factory, it can only seek the greatness of the factory building, so that the work can proceed smoothly. If it can be located in a suitable central location, and is very close to the sources of various necessary objects, that is the most ideal.

(4) Transportation issues: The transportation issue of a manufacturing factory is very important, especially when the products of a manufacturing factory sell well throughout the country. It must rely on convenient transportation to enable the goods to reach various provinces and cities quickly. Then, being close to transportation institutions such as railway stations and docks can save transportation costs on the one hand, and save transportation time on the other hand.

Therefore, when we want to establish a new manufacturing factory, the above points should be considered, but in fact, sometimes it may not be possible to solve the problems in all aspects perfectly. Then, we can only weigh the pros and cons and deal with them accordingly.

### The Deeply Locked Buddha Hall and Dust-Sealed Cellar: Unveiling the Inside Story of the Dragon Flower Society

— Sent by Mei Jian

Tianjin, 8th (Air Mail Report)

Yesterday afternoon, the reporter, along with Section Chief Chen of the Social Affairs Bureau, made a special trip to No. 47 Yangjia Garden to investigate the details of the sealing of the Neng Hua Society. Not far from the main street in front of the Sino-Western Women's School, a majestic mansion can be seen from afar. Entering the gate, which is like that of a prince's residence, is an outer courtyard lined with flowers and trees. Led by the guarding police, we entered a row of five large halls facing south, where many people with long hair and left-fastened robes were sitting and lying uneasily, their brows furrowed, reminiscing about their dreams of being emperors.

Asking the "Father-in-Law" to Show the Newspaper

After settling down, the guard, Section Chief Chen, reported that the escaped Vice President Tao Xiang had surrendered himself at around 4:00 AM on the 7th and was now resting in the inner room. After we sent people to invite him three times, this self-proclaimed "Father-in-Law," the deputy leader, finally emerged slowly. Section Chief Chen first took out a copy of the Yishi Daily from his pocket and had the vice president sit down and read it carefully, intending to make this strange man, who was isolated from the world, understand the reasons for the Social Affairs Department and the Tianjin Municipal Authorities' sealing of the society, as well as the lenient handling policies of the responsible authorities in the future.

This vice president reluctantly calmed himself and finished reading, then held his head in his hands, showing a distressed face, furrowing his brows and closing his eyes, trying to squeeze out a few tears to win sympathy. However, his emotions and tears were not under artificial control, so he couldn't shed any.

Speaking Despondently, the Phone Call is Bizarre

He said dejectedly: "I am already 62 years old. Last year, I was arrested by the Japanese Kempeitai in Harbin, who knocked out my teeth and beat my ears. I never thought that now..." According to him: On the morning of the 6th, he took a plane to Beiping, preparing to go to Shanghai. He was resting at the Liangshi Store and Shengguan Restaurant outside Qianmen in Beiping when he received a call from Tianjin saying that something had happened at the Dajin Society, so he rushed back that night. As for who made the call, he said it wasn't someone from the society, but probably a friend nearby. He refused to reveal who this friend was. Only he himself knows whether he went to Beiping or was hiding in Tianjin.

The "Emperor" Has Gone Far Away, His Fate Unknown

The reporter asked, "Where is Ma Yingshi (i.e., 'Emperor Ma')?" He said, "The old man left in the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1935]. The two brothers who went with him returned and said that the old man went to Mount Luoqi in the South Sea." "Have there been any messages since then?" the reporter asked. He continued, "No, it's hard to say whether he is still alive or has ascended to heaven." The reporter asked, "What about the two brothers who came back?" He said, "The two brothers both died not long after returning."

The Eight Great "Courtiers" Wailed Loudly

If you want to find out the whereabouts of "Emperor Ma" from their mouths, it cannot be obtained by interviewing. At this time, the eight responsible persons (the so-called Eight Great Courtiers) gathered in the hall, when they heard that "the old man had already ascended to heaven," began to wail and cry as if they had lost their parents. The guards repeatedly stopped them. They thought that "crying" would win everyone's sympathy, and they took the opportunity to boast about their achievements in running charitable causes and protecting underground workers.

Answering Reporters' Questions, Many Different Opinions

When the reporter asked them, "What work did you do during the period of the enemy puppet regime? Why are there no account books?" They stammered and said, "The past is in the past, and we don't remember clearly." "There were account books originally, but because we heard that the authorities were going to ban us, we hid both prohibited and non-prohibited items." "Outsiders all say that Master Ma is Emperor Ma, with an army, feudal courtiers, concubines, and revised calendar..." "That's not true. I don't know who we offended. They are just spreading rumors. The so-called revision of the calendar, changing one year to eighteen months and each month to forty-eight days, this was not created by us. Some books say so. If that kind of calendar is used, the world will be at peace, so we believe in it. We didn't create it ourselves, you know?"

Founded for a Long Time, 35 Years

The reporter asked them why they keep long queues, they said: "Having hair is having the law." The reporter did not understand what they meant by "law." Was it magic? Regulations? They refused to explain it clearly.

They continued: "This society was founded in the year of Xinhai [1911] and has been around for thirty-five years. We were investigated and sealed in Shandong. Later, we moved to Beijing. The Master was assassinated in Jinan. The Master Ma was saddened and angered, so he disappeared." They stated repeatedly that their position was purely charitable. When they weren't careful, they would unconsciously reveal some clues that they were colluding with ambitious warlords and instigating chaos.

Two "Princesses" Cultivating in the Inner Room

In order to express that there were no secrets in their inner courtyard, they hoped to guide the reporter to see each department. The reporter followed them up and down the building for a quick look. Of course, it would not be easy to discover any secrets. One hundred and sixty-two male members were arranged in each room, sitting leisurely, waiting for fate to arrange their destiny. Forty-five of the one hundred and forty-five female members had already reported the locking of their household registrations and returned to their hometowns. The remaining ones were only elderly and weak rural women and girls. There were a few women in their thirties, but they didn't look as beautiful as the rumors said. However, looking at the household registration records, except for one-tenth being old women and young girls, most were young women in their twenties and thirties, but they were not seen. However, the two princesses, who were respected outside, had not left. One was named Ma Haocheng, 29 years old, and the other was named Ma Shanxing, 30 years old. It is said that they were dressed in Taoist robes and hats, and because they felt uncomfortable, they were resting in the inner room. The reporter did not dare to disturb them and failed to see the style of the princesses. The furnishings of the female members' room, the furniture for sitting and sleeping, were all antique and gorgeous. Being in it, it was difficult to feel that it was a place for quiet cultivation. Even the mansions of wealthy merchants and old men were not as good.

The Garden Has Many Exotic Flowers and the Buddha Hall is Deeply Closed

Leaving the inner courtyard, entering the garden pavilion, strange flowers and precious trees, quiet and secluded, although it has been in disrepair for many years, it cannot conceal its luxurious nature. The space between the guest hall and the inner house is the Buddha hall. Because it has been sealed by the Tianjin Police Bureau, it is impossible to see the whole picture. Looking through the glass windows, only incense tables and offerings can be seen. In the middle is a cinnabar Buddha character. It is said that the society does not worship idols, but only regards the Wuji Old Mother as the invisible master.

After visiting the headquarters, we went to the "Poor People's Clinic" attached to the society. The clinic is a three-entrance courtyard. The front yard is the hospital. A Western doctor has returned to his original residence in Datong. A Chinese medicine doctor, Mr. Wang, also appeared in front of us in the same attire. The middle courtyard is the dormitory for female members. Most of them are concentrated in the headquarters, leaving only a blind and deaf old woman to guard it.

The backyard is the kitchen. Underneath the kitchen, there is a cellar, which is already filled with furnace ash. It is not yet known whether there are any secrets underneath. One place is a school that has been suspended. One place is a dormitory for female members, but they have all been concentrated at the headquarters, so there is no need to visit it, so we gave up.

Writing about all these details are all impressions gained by the reporter. Because the society had concealed everything in advance, it was difficult to obtain the confirmation of what was rumored outside. The words of the parties involved were incoherent, making it even more difficult to discover anything from the conversation. The matter itself is a mystery, and the unveiling of the mystery cannot be done in a short time. What the truth is remains to be seen through the authorities' multi-faceted searches and the parties' frank confessions.

### The Two Main Culprits of the Dragon Flower Society: "Emperor" Ma and "Father-in-Law" Tao

Since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, the Japanese militarists, who were dreaming of invading China, in order to achieve their illusion of a continental policy, in addition to carrying out various aggressive offensives on the front, also secretly supported those warlords and bandits who had no national concept, creating many seeds that could promote internal strife in our country. After the July 7th Incident, they intensified their efforts to create various puppet organizations in the occupied areas, using various secret societies, spreading heresies, in order to eliminate the patriotic feelings of our compatriots and corrupt the social order of our country.

Uneasily Publishing Announcements to Refute Rumors

Before the 6th, the One Heart Heavenly Way Dragon Flower Holy Church had repeatedly published announcements in various newspapers to refute rumors, and stated that the society's position was upright and fair. We felt that something was suspicious. Why would everyone spread rumors about a religious group? As a result, the truth was revealed. The so-called One Heart Heavenly Way Dragon Flower Holy Church was originally a secret organization of heresy and ghost ways manufactured by the enemy, as mentioned earlier.

Far-Reaching and Powerful Criminals Slipping Through the Net

At about 10:00 AM on the 6th, the Police Bureau, upon the order of the Municipal Government, specially dispatched the captain of the Criminal Brigade, the chief of the Administrative Section, and the chief of the 7th Branch Bureau, Jia Hanshen, and others, leading more than 30 armed police officers, to the One Heart Heavenly Way Dragon Flower Holy Church at No. 47 Yangjia Garden to carry out the ban. They arrived at the society at 11:00 AM and immediately launched a search. The head of the society, Ma Guanying, and the deputy head, Tao Yunxiang, as well as 45 young and beautiful female members, had already fled after hearing the news. The remaining 130 male members were there doing their daily routine of cultivation. After the case officers explained their intentions, these villagers, who were being deceived, immediately lost their senses and were sent into the legal net by the Dragon Flower Holy Mother.

The Results of the Search are Being Sorted Out

The Social Affairs Bureau also sent personnel to the scene upon hearing the news and assisted the police bureau's investigation personnel in inspecting everything inside the society. As a result, the evidence that the society colluded with the Japanese enemy to establish the "Greater East Asia Buddhist Federation," hung Japanese flags, and revised the calendar was discovered by the inspection personnel. At that time, the personnel of the Social Affairs Bureau stated that these members were all kind and good people, who had been incited by heresy and ghost ways, resulting in the loss of their family fortunes to join the society. From a human perspective, this is very pitiful. Regarding the illegal parts of the society, in addition to the police bureau continuing to investigate the whereabouts of the head of the society, Ma Guanying, the Social Affairs Bureau decided to give appropriate treatment to the 130 members of the society, in order to eliminate their future pain.

Regarding the motive of the authorities' ban on the One Heart Heavenly Way Dragon Flower Holy Church this time, it is said that as early as six months ago, when Mayor Zhang first took office, many people reported to the Municipal Government, exposing the crimes of the society. At that time, Mayor Zhang believed that since the society was a religious group and had more than 100,000 members, it was not appropriate to act rashly. In addition to sending personnel to investigate the truth of the society, he also sent letters to various provinces and cities to inquire about the society's activities there. At the same time, he personally went to the society to investigate with Deputy Mayor Du, Director Hu of the Social Affairs Bureau, Director Li of the Police Bureau, and others. As a result, many suspicious places were discovered. A few days ago, the Party and government organs of Shanxi, Shandong, and other provinces and cities also separately replied to the Tianjin Municipal Government, proving that the society was purely a heresy. The Ministry of Social Affairs also sent a letter to Tianjin a few days ago, stating that the society's movements were secretive and suspicious, and hoped that the Tianjin Municipal Government would ban it nearby. Therefore, the Municipal Government issued a ban order yesterday morning, ordering the Police Bureau to immediately stop the society's activities.

Self-Proclaimed Emperor, Enfeoffing Ministers, and Accepting Concubines

According to reports, the One Heart Heavenly Way Dragon Flower Holy Church originated in Dingwang Village, Changshan, Shandong. The founder, Ma Shiwei, whose courtesy name was Guanying, was a local ruffian who was restless. Later, he fantasized about becoming an emperor and established the One Heart Hall, using unorthodox methods to lure the villagers, resulting in many who were bewitched by him. When joining the society, one must first donate all their family property to the society, so it is also known as the Qinjia Society (Bankrupt Family Society) or Jingdi Society (Clean Land Society), just like the style of the White Lotus Sect. The Shandong Provincial Government once ordered it to be banned. Ma fled to Dalian, colluding with the Japanese enemy to revive his career. In the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], relying on the cover of the Japanese, he secretly came to Tianjin and found a place in Taoshan Street in the Japanese Concession to set up a society. From then on, it was officially named the One Heart Heavenly Way Dragon Flower Holy Church, obtained a permit from the Japanese Consulate General, and openly carried out activities in the Japanese Concession, spreading heresies, widely recruiting students, calling himself Emperor Ma, enfeoffing ministers, accepting concubines, and arbitrarily revising the calendar, stipulating that one month should have 48 days and one year should have 18 months. The members all kept long hair and beards, wore tall hats and left-fastened robes. At that time, the members of the society often marched in teams, flaunting themselves through the streets, doing everything possible to be strange and unusual. After the July 7th Incident, Tianjin fell, and the society took advantage of the situation to move to No. 47 Yangjia Garden and became very active. In order to repay the Japanese for their support and kindness, the "Greater East Asia Buddhist Federation" was specially established to advocate for the Japanese militarism, painting a bloody and dirty stain on the religious history of our country.

Widely Recruiting Members and Organizing Tightly

The society's address is wide and beautifully decorated. The magnificent situation is like a palace. All the people in the society are members, and outsiders are generally not allowed to mix in. Even servants, rickshaw pullers, tilers, carpenters, tailors, and cooks are all run by the people in the society themselves, like a small kingdom.

### The Seoul Negotiations Issue

Some diplomatic figures have recently criticized Secretary of State Byrnes's misinterpretation after the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, which led to a series of events that eventually caused the US-Soviet negotiations on the Korean issue to break down. There were many factors that caused the breakdown of the meeting, and the Soviet Union's insistence that certain Korean political parties should not be allowed to join the Korean interim government was one of them.

Observers emphasize that we cannot attribute all the blame to the United States or the Soviet Union. There are many major factors of misunderstanding and many conflicts between the United States' principle of freedom of expression and the Soviet Union's political realism. Many misunderstandings still stem from Byrnes's statement, which first hinted that Korean trusteeship might be avoided. At that time, Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US military in Korea, used this statement to deal with the Korean people's opposition to the three-power trusteeship resolution. The result of this move fueled Soviet suspicion that the United States intended to revise the Moscow Conference resolution. Recently, the Soviet Union declared that the negotiations on the Korean issue had failed, indicating that this incident was the main concern of the Soviet side, but the various events that occurred afterwards can explain the current difficulties. In December 1943, the late President Roosevelt, former British Prime Minister Churchill, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek promised at the Cairo Conference to restore Korea's independence when the time was ripe. The United States was then considering the duration of the trusteeship. The original series of errors started from the misunderstanding of the phrase "when the time is ripe." Koreans translated "when the time is ripe" as "immediately." At the Yalta Conference in February 1945, President Roosevelt first publicly announced the Korean issue to Marshal Stalin, who agreed to the trusteeship plan proposed by the United States. The third event occurred at the Potsdam Conference in July 1945, when President Truman obtained Marshal Stalin's second expression of agreement to the trusteeship plan proposed by the United States. Throughout that period, the Soviet Union showed very little interest in this issue, giving the United States the impression that the Soviet Union really did not want the Korean trusteeship system. When Byrnes went to Moscow, he and his experts expected that a bitter struggle would occur if they wanted to get the Soviet Union to agree to sign this plan, but the Soviet Union immediately agreed, but insisted on changing the trusteeship period to "five years" instead of the ten years in the American plan.

Three days after the Moscow Conference, Byrnes gave a broadcast speech, hinting that trusteeship might be avoided. The Soviet Union believes that Byrnes's statement and General Hodge's use of this statement were an expression of the United States' attempt to abandon the trusteeship resolution at the Moscow Conference. The United States spent two years trying to get the Soviet Union to agree to the trusteeship plan. This attitude of the United States is not easy for the Soviet Union to understand. Now that this plan has been signed by both parties, the United States seems to be talking about the possibility of not implementing it. On the other hand, the Soviet Union immediately targeted the anti-trusteeship movement and demanded that parties in Korea that opposed the Moscow Conference resolution should not join the Korean interim government. The United States opposed this demand from the Soviet Union, saying that this demand violated the freedom of expression and "clearing official discipline." The US-Soviet Commission held talks in Seoul for several weeks without any results, and the conclusion of the breakdown lies in this point. US Deputy Secretary of State Acheson emphasized that the United States is deeply willing to reopen negotiations and implement the Moscow Conference resolution, but only after the Soviet Union recognizes the freedom of all Korean people to express their opinions.

### A Country Bumpkin Cries Injustice

Editor: I am a reader of your newspaper, only for a few days. Of course, there are very few opportunities to read newspapers in my hometown. I am very fortunate to see your newspaper now. Your newspaper's comments are fair and can speak for the people very well. That's why I picked up my pen to write out the facts of what has been like hell for my hometown in the past few years, to cry out for the wronged dead and to accuse the Japanese who slowly killed young men and women and the bandits who held guns and coerced good people. My hometown is located in Huangjueqiao Town, a small town thirty miles north of Yangzhou. Because of the dense population and many villages, it is incomparable to other towns. Although the land is fertile, the old crops are not connected to the new, which is a phenomenon that occurs every year. Since the rise of the military, my hometown, for the sake of self-defense, organized the Big Knife Society, which was somewhat superstitious, but it was envied by the Japanese, who thought it was a planned organization. One morning, just as it was getting light, hundreds of brutal Japanese descended on my town. They robbed all the big knives from our Big Knife Society, and killed more than 200 people in a one-mile radius. In Zhao Jialin Village alone, more than 40 young men and women were brutally killed. At that time, the scene in my hometown was tragic. There was a pile of corpses in the east and a pile of corpses in the west. Every night, the sound of crying for one's children echoed throughout the countryside. Writing this, my heart is truly sore and I want to cry. From then on, the Big Knife Society was silent. Then, Wang Changji, Zhao Xietou, Guo Shuiquan, Lao Miao, and other leaders led 30 to 40 plainclothes teams to my town, claiming to maintain the town, but in reality they were bandits, exploiting us to the extreme. We had to provide military rations every three days and military clothing expenses every five days. How could my poor hometown bear it? In less than a month since they came to my hometown, they openly and brutally killed the people in as many as six or seven incidents. The victims were all farmers with more than 20 or 30 mu of land. The reason was nothing more than resisting the payment of military rations, and then they would add the charge of being a traitor. The poor, ignorant villagers did not know where the charge of traitor came from and were shot dead for no reason! A farmer in a certain village had a beautiful wife. When the leader of the Lao Miao team took a fancy to her, the farmer was also charged with being a traitor and was shot dead. Guo Yongquan, who had the qualifications of being a team leader in the plainclothes team, wanted to establish an immortal career in my hometown. He often held a gun and forced farmers to write deeds of alienation. A farmer named Chen was forced to move out of his residence in winter because he owed a few yuan. There are too many similar things to mention. In less than a year since they lived in my hometown, the bandit Guo had accumulated more than 30 or 40 mu of good (?) land. The evil deeds of the others, such as Zhao Xietou and Wang Changji, can be imagined. We poor farmers, who had no one to complain to, were first brutally killed by the Japanese and then bullied by the bandits. We had to pray to the dark heavens, hoping that the Japanese would surrender and that we could avenge ourselves and eliminate the traitors. The news of victory finally reached our ears. The joy at that time was truly indescribable. We fully thought that after the Japanese surrendered, the old central government would arrive. But we were very disappointed. The ones who came a few days after the victory were the Communist army! And the cunning Guo Yongquan and others were still flaunting themselves as underground heroes! I am angry and I hate it. I am angry that we farmers didn't shout louder and I hate that we farmers didn't call out louder, and let the Japanese who brutally killed us still live safely in the concentration camps, and the domineering bandits and gang leaders are still at large, and are still doing who knows what kind of officials! A genuine country bumpkin. 6.8.

### The Night the Curfew Was Lifted

— Shao Fu

The usual deathly silence of Nanking Road, like an ancient path placed in the realm of ghosts. Blue Neon Lights, like fireflies; Red Neon Lights, colors of terror. Laughter, commotion, all the daytime clamor, drifted like wisps of smoke to the distant horizon. A void atmosphere, a poet would give it a slight sigh, a silent lament.

A rickshaw appeared, a pedicab, at the corner of Jiangxi Road and Henan Road, their eyes shining as they searched for night walkers, those emerging from the homes of dancing girls, from the mansions of "crab" friends, from many unknown and unnecessary-to-know places... those weary returning guests. They were not making much money, circling in disappointment, night revelers were not yet widespread.

An old Indian doorman, as usual, leaned against the cement wall in front of the Ulo Company on Sichuan Road. I thought, he has a ledger in his mind, meticulously recording the number of vehicles and pedestrians that passed on a certain night, and tonight, the street is a bit different. He no longer remembers the sands of the Ganges and the accumulated snow on the peaks of the Himalayas, does he?

Sichuan Road Bridge, a white maggot crawling on the Suzhou Creek, it tells people that the south is the city, and the north is the countryside. The Hongkou district is even more dilapidated now. If you practice a one-mile marathon, this straight and long Sichuan Road is a good place.

The Shanghai-Woosung Garrison Headquarters, the First Pacification Zone Headquarters, brightly lit, still had three sentries in front of each.

On Jiangwan Road, a continuous line of hawkers carrying vegetables, the curfew has always been an exception for them.

The bright moonlight pours down, tonight, Shanghai is still quiet.

### At a Wedding Ceremony, Who Praises the Bride and Groom's Chastity?

— Yang Mou

Even though social order is still chaotic, even though human morality is still declining, everyone still wants to preserve some dignity and face for themselves, and no one is willing to admit that they have done something despicable.

For example, even though everyone says that officialdom is corrupt and many cases of embezzlement, dereliction of duty, and bribery occur. But which civil servant is willing to admit to taking bribes? You can't say that there is no bribery in the political world now, but how can you say that there is definitely such a phenomenon in the political world now? Everyone's self-promotion is all about being honest, bright, and great!

However, recently, at the entrance of a certain government office, there were eight large characters pasted: "Taking Bribes and Giving Bribes, Both Will Be Severely Punished," which was startling. The original intention, of course, was to warn those who come and to show justice and honesty, but in fact, this is really superfluous.

At a grand wedding ceremony, all kinds of compliments can be said, but no guest would ever compliment the new couple on their "chastity." If someone really did that, it might cause the new couple great embarrassment. In fact, it is, of course, a matter of course that husband and wife should be chaste.

Places smeared with "No Urinating" or covered with graffiti are often public urinals. Because most Chinese people are the smartest, they can read between the lines, they think that since someone wrote "No Urinating," of course someone has urinated here, and since someone has urinated here, why can't I? Thus, in a grand spectacle, the words "No Urinating" have become the registered trademark of public toilets.

Of course, we don't want to "judge the gentleman's heart with the villain's belly," but for a dignified municipal government agency to post such a notice is a bit tragic! Everyone knows the story of "Hiding Three Hundred Taels of Silver Here, Zhang San Next Door Didn't Steal," and of course we don't want a certain agency's notice to become this kind of reverse writing.

In fact, to ban bribery, it is also very convenient, there is no need for such painstaking effort. As long as every official does not take bribes, then those who offer bribes will have no way to use their skills and will have to disappear. As for officials not taking bribes, that only depends on the supervisor's virtue and rectification, and such "airing dirty linen in public" is, in fact, of little use!

### Comic Strip: The Adventures of San Mao (36)

### Not a Myth: Fish and Shellfish Speak, Strange Sounds from the Seabed

One of our traditional concepts of the sea is: as silent as a tomb. But the sea is not silent. In many parts of the ocean—like Chesapeake Bay (near Virginia in the United States), the Gulf of Mexico, the waters off San Francisco, and the South Pacific—the fish that live there often make various sounds, like the calls of pigs, cows, cats, mice, crows, and frogs, some like groans, and some like loud laughter; in addition, various shrimps and crustaceans make explosive and chirping sounds.

Moreover, these sounds are very noisy, enough to hinder the reconnaissance work of submarines, mines, etc. In the early days of the war, rumors of strange sounds from the seabed spread simultaneously in the headquarters of the U.S. Pacific Fleet and the Atlantic Fleet. Submarine drivers returning from patrols in the Pacific reported that they heard owl calls, pig grunts, and chirping sounds in the ocean near the Philippines. Submariners returning from the coast of Borneo reported hearing mournful groans and the clanging of chains. The operators of underwater detectors sat breathlessly all day, waiting for the faint sound of enemy艇 propellers, when suddenly a fierce and terrifying "glug glug" sound and an explosion-like sound would come from their headphones. The operators inspected the sound detectors and found nothing wrong, and the source of the strange sounds could not be explained.

U.S. Army and Navy personnel and scientists once installed a complex harbor defense system along the Atlantic coast of Chesapeake, using electric wires to connect underwater hydrophones and electric alarms to coastal listening stations, using sound to make warning lights light up. If a German submarine invaded the bay, a light would light up, and if the submarine continued to advance into the bay, then other lights would light up one after another, so that the location of the invading enemy艇 could be known, and then mines could be triggered to blow up the enemy. But this plan did not work as expected. When it was first used, the operator suddenly gasped and shouted, "The entire German Navy has invaded the bay!" Every light was on.

The scientists in charge of the harbor defense equipment hurriedly looked out at the ocean surface, but no fleet was approaching; they took the machine apart to inspect it, and then reassembled it and tried again; all the warning lights still lit up. So they turned off the lights and listened quietly with headphones, and only heard a rough groan and a croaking sound, as if it were coming from all parts of the bay. They could not solve this mystery, so they had to call the wartime research laboratory at Columbia University. The institute specially sent acoustics expert Profut to be responsible for studying this matter. Profut spent a lot of effort, speculating and researching from all aspects, and finally determined from the mouths of fishermen that the sound was emitted from a silver fish called Croaker, which was ten inches long and looked almost like ordinary fish.

Later, Profut got a pair of live Croaker fish, kept them in a large bucket of seawater, and at the same time put a hydrophone into the water, and then retreated to a considerable distance away, and listened quietly with many other scientists. When the two fish had calmed down and realized that they were still alive, the conversation began, and the "gak gak" sound was transmitted from the hydrophone to the ears of the scientists, who all nodded in agreement. The so-called "German navy in full force" turned out to be tens of millions of Croaker fish!

This kind of fish is abundant in Chesapeake Bay, and an average of 40 million pounds are caught every year, which is an important food fish. Another kind called "drum fish" also belongs to this category. It is said that both male and female fish have a gas bubble in their body, shaped like an ordinary bass drum, and due to the twitching of a certain muscle in the abdomen, it makes a "gak gak" sound like drumming. When a large group of these fish gather together, the sound becomes a grand noise.

Profut and other scientists were commissioned by the U.S. Navy to continue to study the sound-emitting fish in the ocean, measure their volume, and determine methods to prevent these sounds from interfering with submarine reconnaissance work. They once heard various sounds like cows mooing, pigs grunting, chickens crowing, and frogs croaking in a certain ocean, which was simply noisier than a farm!

According to research, in addition to the Croaker, the main sound-emitting fish are: sea catfish, pufferfish, hogfish, sandfish, various drumfish, kingfish, iron-mouthed fish, sea eel, blue-winged fish, toadfish, etc. This last kind of fish continuously emits a low-pitched humming sound like a small steamboat whistle, and is said to be the noisiest fish in the ocean.

Some of these fish make sounds by grinding their teeth, some make sounds by compressing air through the trachea, and some make sounds by striking the gas bubble with abdominal muscles.

In addition, scientists have heard several strange sounds in the Pacific Ocean that have not yet been identified as being made by fish: one is the meowing sound of a cat; one is the frightening clanging sound of iron chains, which one submarine captain suspected was a new type of secret weapon of the Japanese; one is the sharp rubbing sound of rusty hinges; one is a miserable groan like a prisoner being tortured, making people suspect that sailors were being sentenced to be tortured at the bottom of the sea for crimes. Others have heard a continuous explosive sound, like burning dry branches and cooking lard in a hot pot.

Five years ago, Howard Smith, director of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, heard a mysterious "tick tock" sound in the ocean, which rang continuously from 11:00 every morning, never stopping all year round. After the newspaper announced it, various rumors spread for a while. Some said it was the sound of oil wells pumping oil near the coast, some said it was the sound of cars coming and going on the coastal road, some said it was the sound of ship engines, the sound of electric current generated by the movement of sea sand, the sound of dredging machines, the agitation of dormant volcanoes... The most interesting thing was that a woman wrote to the newspaper, explaining that the sound was due to a team of Chinese people digging a tunnel from China to Los Angeles at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. She said that she got this clue from her husband, who had traveled around the world and revealed this secret in his sleep!

Finally, three scientists at the Coast and Geodetic Survey discovered the source of the strange sound, which was two kinds of small shrimps. This small animal is about one and a half inches long, very active and combative, and extremely difficult to catch. It has a large carapace and a pair of short and powerful pincers. When the pincers snap together, it makes a faint and crisp ticking sound. They live in groups near coral reefs, numbering in the millions. They compete for food and flap their pincers, and thus make a huge noise, which can be heard at the bottom of the sea a mile away.

In addition, a certain type of shrimp will make a sound like a cricket when frightened, and there is also a kind of crab that lives in the deep sea and makes a sharp sound like a pencil writing on a slate.

Why do these fish and shellfish in the ocean make these kinds of sounds? Scientists have not yet obtained a clear proof. Generally speaking, 5% of the reason is to convey meaning, and 95% is just to make sounds, which is no different from us humans.

### Zhang Xueliang's Couplet

— Ping

In January of the seventeenth year, Zhang Xueliang handwritten a couplet to a friend, the words are as follows:

Two words, listening to people calling me Unworthy, Half a lifetime, it was my intelligence that misled me.

The inscription reads: "In the military camp in Baochang, I left these words and ink for Yun Shi to see and love them, so I present them and record them."

Signed: "Zhang Xueliang of Linming," both the writing and the couplet are excellent.

### Singaporean Dancers: The Most Popular Earn 800 Yuan Per Month

In the Singaporean dance scene, Shanghai dancers used to occupy a prominent position. The Liang sisters once held court in Singapore, enjoying the fame of queens and remaining popular for a long time. According to letters from Singapore, there are currently 907 dancers in Singapore, with eight dance halls. The price of a dance ticket varies from one yuan for three dances to one yuan for four dances. The average monthly income of a dancer is about 200 yuan, while those who are more successful can earn 300 to 400 yuan. The "dance queens" can earn up to 800 yuan per month.

Recently, a "child kidnapping case" occurred in Tianjin, causing a great stir. Because children were frequently missing, it plunged housewives, children, and students into a state of terror. Although the police, after investigation, considered it unreliable, rumors continued to circulate in society. Some said that child kidnappers had indeed been arrested recently. Some said that hypnotics were found on them. Still others said that one kidnapper, after being arrested, was tied up by citizens in the square, where he was beaten and scolded, but the kidnapper showed no signs of pain. Later, someone found a plaster on his back, and after removing it, he started to cry out in pain.

At the same time, in the ancient capital not far from Tianjin, a bizarre strange case also occurred. Ye Qiming, a tea server at the New New Cinema, used anesthetics to bewilder women in the cinema and public places, and then sold them. According to the police investigation, within two weeks in May, he had sold as many as 14 beautiful girls under the age of sixteen. According to reports, the anesthetic was prepared by a certain pharmacy in Dong'an Market. After slapping this thing on a woman's head, she would become unconscious and follow his every move, allowing him to do as he pleased. She could only be awakened by spraying her with cold water.

The stalls in Chongqing's Fuzi Pond are becoming increasingly innovative. In the beginning, they were indeed stalls for used goods, but soon they became places for selling new goods and odds and ends, and now they are about to become outlets for foreign goods.

A public office in Chongqing notified the neighborhood chiefs to attend a meeting. The original text of the notification was as follows: "It is hereby notified that local self-government is the people of this locality using the funds of this locality to handle the affairs of this locality and various administrative undertakings related to it, which is self-government. Now that constitutional government is being implemented and power is being returned to the people, all local affairs should be discussed by convening the masses in accordance with the law.

A Collection of Brief Comments

### Yang Xizhi Returns: As If to Say, "See What I Can Do?"

— Wuling Ren

The power outage in Nanshi for two nights caused great suffering to the residents. Power outages are common and unremarkable in Chongqing. Perhaps the authorities are afraid that the people who return after the victory will forget the difficult and hard life of the past, and the power outage is also a way to wake people up. Indeed, the present is still a very difficult time!

On the sixth of this month, another female panda was captured in Wenchuan, Sichuan, smaller than the one previously given to England. Where it will be sent is being requested from the provincial government. At the same time, according to a Nanjing telegram, there are a large number of stray dogs in Nanjing, and the cleaning team of the health bureau has been killing more than a thousand of them in recent days. Rarity is valuable, which is not surprising. When all the dogs in the world are killed one day, those that survive will inevitably be valued by people. They will be called "Miss," airlifted to foreign countries, and the dogs will "take off," which is also expected.

Amidst the uproar over the grain loan scandal, it was suddenly reported that Yang Xizhi would return from the United States to take up a new position in the Storage and Transportation Bureau, which can also be considered a kind of satire.

Wuxi held a ball game for the Respect Teachers Movement, and the mermaid Yang Xiuqiong was invited to the venue to kick off the game. The county magistrate held a lavish banquet, which cost more than 300,000 yuan, which caused criticism. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida invited political leaders to a dinner to discuss the grain shortage crisis, but he used delicacies and fine wines to treat the guests. One of the guests, upon seeing the table full of delicacies, immediately shouted about rice, saying that the Prime Minister should not be so extravagant, and resolutely refused to eat, and left in anger.

I hold the "eat-as-much-as-you-can" principle, so if I were a guest, I would definitely just eat without worrying about the bill, why bother to think so much? I would never be as angry as the guests invited by the Japanese Prime Minister. If the Japanese were really all sensible, they would not have been so miserably defeated today.

Singing and dancing in the dim light, competing to stop the horses,
Embracing and dancing, the fun is in full swing.
Never mind the wailing cries that have spread all over the land,
How can the pliant waists and foxy steps be so enjoyable?

Medical and Health

(1) Jinshan's Renfu asks: My feet have been swollen since last winter until now, day and night, very severely, never ceasing. At first, I suspected that it was caused by the cold, so I used medicinal wine to rub them, but it didn't work. Then I was afraid that the blood was not flowing properly, so I drank medicinal wine to promote blood circulation, but it didn't work either. I think my feet are moving appropriately, I have never had excessive activity or inactivity, and my body is also healthy. I don't know what the disease is? What treatment is available? Please ask Dr. Zhang to answer.

(Answer from Dr. Zhang Zhongming) Your illness is probably rheumatic arthritis. You should take Atophau tablets or inject Nonalgin injections, which can be effective.

(2) Shi Mingfu asks: My father is a senile old man in his seventies, and he contracted tertian malaria two years ago. He was already a candle in the wind, how could he withstand the ravages of the disease? So every time the disease occurs, he always vomits, and sometimes even vomits a little blood. He is naturally unable to bear the pain, so he cannot help but groan and shout. Sir: How can a son bear it? Therefore, doctors were consulted from all sides, and medicines were tried, but none were effective. It recurred and relapsed for nearly three years. I am heartbroken and really have no way to deal with it. Knowing that your newspaper helps people solve problems without reservation, I take the liberty of asking if there is any special medicine? Please tell me the name of the medicine in detail. I will be very grateful.

(Answer from Dr. Zhang Zhongming) Elderly people suffering from malaria can use Atebrine tablets, which are very effective and have few side effects.

(3) Xu Rong asks: Fifteen years ago, I injured my left ribs due to carrying a heavy load and falling. At that time, I felt shortness of breath. Before a month had passed, I started coughing violently. Although I coughed and stopped from time to time since then, my body became thinner day by day. After half a year, my waist became sore and I couldn't sit for long. X-ray fluoroscopy showed that my right lung had pleurisy, which has now healed, and my left lung and heart are normal. Now I cough and wheeze as before, especially at night. Please enlighten me as to what disease it is and to what extent it has progressed.

(Answer from Dr. Zhang Zhongming) The symptoms you describe are probably caused by the spread of tuberculosis bacteria and physical weakness. You should rest more, pay attention to nutrition, and eat more various vitamins and cod liver oil and other supplements.

### Abandoned Babies on the Roadside

Dear Editor: Every morning when I go to school, there are small cloth packages about two feet long on the sidewalk, tightly bound with straw ropes. After a few turns, one is discovered. I was completely confused, what are these things? After a few days, I went to see them again, and they were still there, and the positions had not moved. However, after being exposed to rain and sun, the color of the cloth seemed a little old, and the ropes had also been broken. My curiosity made me unable to restrain myself, and I told my classmates about this. A fat classmate was very brave and untied one of the small packages to observe. What is this? Ah! I can't believe it, a child, probably a few months old, lying stiffly and sleeping forever in the package! Dear Editor, I really can't believe it. Have those police officers and cleaning officers seen it usually? If no measures are taken to eliminate these small packages, then all the diseases in Shanghai will become even more rampant. Sir, what is your opinion? Wan Jiushui, No. 42, Jishifei Road, Shanghai. 6.12.
